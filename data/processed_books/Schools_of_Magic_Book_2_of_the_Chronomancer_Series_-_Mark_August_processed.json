      "title": "Kincaid - Consequences",
      "content": "Kincaid - Consequences Fight or starve. Kincaid wiped blood from his mouth with the back of his hand. The smear ran up to his sleeve, and the grime tasted like dirt and iron. His left fist clutched the ground for balance; he was no longer an apprentice carpenter. He brought his fists in front of his face and stared up at the giant in the ring. The shirtless man was twice his height. A broad chest rippled with strength as he clapped his palms together, and an empty mouth of shattered teeth grinned. He gestured for Kincaid to launch the next attack. The crowd gathered in the old warehouse erupted with the display of sportsmanship. They were getting their money’s worth in this David versus Goliath competition. The fighter was a favorite of the town and defeated everyone on the coast of Caesea, and Kincaid played those odds. Fight or starve. He needed to win. Kincaid nodded his appreciation for the showmanship, which allowed him to steady his balance. The man’s blows were lightning fast for his size, and he hit like a horse’s hoof. Another blow like that and Kincaid would be out. Unwilling to take more risk, Kincaid opened his heart, mind, and soul to the forces of magic. He summoned a trickle of power into his soul, and his senses exploded around him. He filtered the noises and the faces of the crowd and focused on his opponent. The giant wasn’t breathing hard, and the first droplet of sweat formed on his brow. His heart thumped in anticipation, not fatigue. Kincaid wouldn't wear this man down. Where did he get this endurance? Pain disappeared with the magic pounding in his veins. The arcane power was music longing to rise from a soft beat to a crescendo. Magic pushed against his restraint and hungered for explosive release. Kincaid struggled for control with the arcane might at his command for less than a heartbeat, and the young man heard the giant’s boots creak. Sportsman or not, he wasn’t waiting. The courtesy of the fight was over, and the giant would finish the contest with a flourish. Spectators expected their winnings. The man was a trained fighter. As he closed into range, he balanced his weight forward on his feet, and his arms covered his face and upper chest. His entire body bobbed to the sides to get Kincaid to commit in a direction. The best the carpenter could do was stay out of reach. Tired of the retreating target, the giant surged forward. He led with a left jab with the length of a lance. Kincaid heard the muscles tense and explode outward. The small fighter pulled his body to the right and around the powerful punch. Kincaid threw his right fist and contacted the man’s ribs with the thud of bone against muscle. The crowd hushed as the impact forced a grunt from the giant. Before the first punch registered, Kincaid leveraged his surprise and landed a left straight in the giant’s gut. The blow cracked the tension, and the crowd exploded with cheers. Money clanked and changed hands. The favorite backed up and rubbed his chest. Kincaid’s blows were impossibly strong. The fighter's eyes were wide with confusion, but Kincaid wouldn’t share the secret of his powerful strikes. Fight or starve. Kincaid’s visions of victory distracted him from the moment, and the giant gave no quarter in this ring. Kincaid wasn’t paying attention as the blow smashed his forehead. His vision exploded with stars, and his legs turned to mush from the impact. His mind screamed to watch for the next inbound strike to his face even as his body refused to obey the command. The surge of magic saved his life as he knocked aside the jab with his forearm. Disbelief registered on the giant’s face. Recovering from the punishment but only looking through one unswollen eye, Kincaid launched his counterblow. His right fist impacted the man’s chin. Kincaid felt the stubble of the man’s beard on his knuckles as the giant rocked back on his heels. The young wizard hammered blows to the body. Thud followed crack as the fists hit like a smith’s hammer. Even the giant's iron body surrendered to the impacts, bending, twisting, and losing strength. The favorite never threw another punch. The magic coursing through Kincaid’s being howled in delight. Warmth of the torches and oil lamps beckoned for Kincaid’s senses. A blast of arcane energy could melt down any opponent standing in front of him. Start your conquest. Finish this fight. Make yourself king. The voice pounded in his skull with each beat of his heart. It had been silent since his duel with Vedette Atros, daughter of the ruling house of Caesea. Their battle led to destruction beyond their wildest imagination. City blocks buried; lives destroyed. He couldn’t do that now, not here. He thrust those thoughts aside. Two more blows powered by his seething anger finished the bout. The giant dropped his arms on the last blow and collapsed backward like a felled tree. Dirt bounced as his body hit the ground. He wouldn’t rise again tonight. Kincaid struggled with the flow of magic as he turned to the crowd. Faces leered with joy, and some growled with hatred. Silver coins passed between gamblers as the carpenter stood alone in the eerie silence of the ring. The fight organizers came forward to the inexperienced fighter, and neither had a pleasant look on their face. “Cheater.” Kincaid shook his head as he fought to get his breath back. “No way you could beat Granite at your size.” The man was from one of the Northern States with his light skin and blue eyes. He was middle-aged, soft, and in control of the fighting venture. Right to where the upset changed everything. He fumed. “Then why go through with the fight? Just let the opponents stand next to each other and let the fans decide.” Sweat dripped as Kincaid shook his head. “They demand a show.” “Not your first match.” The accusation hung in the air. Kincaid allowed the smile to cross his lips. “I’ll take my winnings.” “May let people in this crowd take your life.” “Want to go a round with me?” Kincaid shifted his relaxed posture. He curled his hands into fists and gestured toward the fallen fighter, Granite. Back to fight or starve. The man’s eyes darted toward the immobile champion and the favorite of the night. He looked toward his silent partner, who only gave a nod. “You best get out of here before I change my mind.” Kincaid stepped up to the speaker's face. Inches away from his nose, Kincaid recoiled from the tobacco and alcohol on the man’s breath. “Not until you give me my due. Winner’s fees, now. Or I start the next round right here.” Kincaid would let the man throw the first shot. Just one punch, and then he’d take him. The organizer considered that exact move. But he was an actor on this stage and grabbed Kincaid’s forearm. They faced the crowd, and the organizer thrust Kincaid’s arm toward the ceiling. The fans roared with the victory. Applause thundered across the warehouse. “You come back here, and we’ll kill you.” “Give me my winnings, and I won’t be back.” The silent partner came forward and handed the young victor his bag of silver. There’d be more from the bookies. Kincaid had terrible odds going into the fight, and his small bet could go a long way into surviving a few more days. They wouldn’t starve tonight. Sholeh was waiting for the bruised fighter as he staggered through the door of their room in the broken-down inn. This was what they could afford, and they were late for their last week’s payment. The look on her face flashed from anger to concern as she saw the glowing purple bruises on his face. “By all that is holy, Kincaid, you are fighting again?” She got up from her bed and took two steps toward him. Her soft touch brushed aside the wild shock of his red hair and probed the swelling around his eyes. Kincaid choked back his emotions. “I don’t know how else we can eat and sleep, Sholeh. We’re weeks past the fight in Caesea, and we’re stuck in this harbor town. Atros can find us.” “Did you use magic?” Kincaid turned away from her touch and looked toward the floor. “By all that is good. You will lead Atros and the City Council to us with your magic.” “We’re a long way across the bay.” “But close enough that an agent will find us. There are only so many harbors we could have escaped to. They will not find us in the city, and the towns will be next.” “I can’t let you starve, Sholeh. We’re already—” “I know. But we can do this together, my friend. You do not have to carry this weight across your shoulders.” Kincaid looked toward his few sheets and makeshift pillow on the floor of the room. They could fit both of their belongings in a small sack. They sold the few tools Sholeh had left from her blacksmith trade a week ago, and those funds were dangerously low. Their clothes were their few remaining possessions. “We need to get to the Empire, Sholeh.” “Magic.” The accusation was a whisper. This wasn’t the first time they had this discussion. “Yes. I don’t know what else to do. Magi Cormac gave me that last instruction before I…” Sholeh waited for the lengthy pause. “You had to kill him to survive. And we are alive today.” The anger once in her tone was long gone. She supported him with his emotional burden. “I can’t let us starve, Sholeh. And we can’t stay here. How do we earn enough to get out of here?” “Work together. We know we cannot afford passage on a ship, so we must focus on land travel. A caravan.” Kincaid’s power could destroy city blocks, and only his imagination limited his arcane ability. But the actual source of his strength stood next to him. When his soul ached, Sholeh filled the emptiness. Every time he used magic, his fatigue deepened. It was a fatigue that didn’t get better with rest, and Kincaid knew he sacrificed his soul with each use. He rested his willpower on the strong shoulders of his friend. “At least we won’t starve tonight. Will you get food while I change?” Sholeh nodded once, grabbed the smallest coin from the bag of winnings and walked downstairs to the inn to see what was left from dinner. The fight would begin again tomorrow.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Working for a Living",
      "content": "Sholeh - Working for a Living Using magic in the lands of Caesea was punishable by death. After they escaped from the island capital, Kincaid and Sholeh couldn’t afford to travel farther inland and were still within the city leadership’s reach. With this latest brawl, Kincaid risked discovery by powerful forces again, and the risk grew each day. Sholeh lay awake, staring at the rotting timbers of their ceiling as Kincaid rolled in his thin blanket and wrestled against unseen demons. His mind and body engaged in a fight she couldn’t explain. Sholeh didn’t pretend to understand magic or its consequences to its user. Until Kincaid emerged from prison, she didn’t know her friend wielded arcane power. The changes were astounding. Once a prodigy carpenter ready to make a worldwide name in his craft, he was now a hardened man forced from one tough choice to the next by events beyond his control. The fight tonight was an example of his decision-making. He slipped away, claiming he was looking for a job, and found another off-the-record match. By his reasoning, it was the right thing to do. Sholeh blinked away the tear because he had to lie to her. She knew he was running out of options with locations because he always won against the ring favorite. They had to find a way out of Caesean lands. Years ago, Kincaid and his sister arrived in Caesea and worked their way up from the bottom as poverty-stricken immigrants. A craftsmaster took them in and shared the secrets of his art. Everything changed with Kincaid’s arcane power. Now he was a man with unimaginable potential running from the authorities. Sholeh’s heart broke each point he slid into terrible choices. Magic had a severe cost, and she’d seen it in her friend’s eyes. Kincaid told her his very soul was at stake each moment he wielded his magic. Lessons from her time in the churches in the Empire of a Thousand Spears glorified the immortal human soul, and decisions a person made directed their soul’s immortality into an afterlife. Kincaid’s experience with arcane power shook the foundations of faith. Sholeh couldn’t wait. Kincaid needed her help as much as she needed him. She wasn’t a frail maiden waiting for rescue. While he tossed and turned on the floor, Sholeh rose to gather her things and dressed in the frosty air of the room. She slipped out the door in the pre-dawn light. The harbor town was in motion with the anticipation of the outgoing tide. Shouts from people used to the demands of their trade echoed in the streets up from the docks. In the morning gloom, Sholeh trudged her way to the busy bodies of sailors, laborers, and stevedores racing against the unforgiving tide. Sholeh trained as a blacksmith for years in both the Empire and Caesea, and she considered going to the docks to make her living with the hardened strength in her arms. But she couldn’t afford to get crossways with the Porters’ Guild. She might make a few copper pennies, but she and Kincaid didn’t need another powerful enemy. She turned away from the water lapping against the wooden pillars and slapping against the ships' hulls. The town was a haphazard placement of makeshift buildings hugging the shoreline. Sholeh wondered if the town even had a name. The natural harbor was a boon for trade, and people who couldn’t afford to live in the island capital in the center of the bay settled in scattered villages along the coastline, hoping to profit from the excess of Caesea. Streets were often empty, just dirty spaces between homes, and frequently too narrow or twisty for a single wagon to travel the length. Smoke rose from the chimneys of bakers and smiths. Daily labor began at the call of the morning bells, but apprentices stoked the fires to the correct temperature long before sunrise. Her fingers itched to find a way into one of these forges and show her skill. Voices lifted to meet the dawn and challenged the clatter from the docks. Not shouts or curses: a song. Sholeh’s heart leaped for a moment as more voices joined the refrain. The hymn was off key and yet pure in its intent—simple words to greet the rising sun. The hills burned with the reddish morning glow. Another triumphant arrival of a new day. The song of morning light. Sholeh faced the ghosts of her past. The church was a plain structure of wood and stone. The few parishioners couldn’t afford a cathedral with lofty spires hungering for the touch of the heavens. This building was modest, a single floor that looked like a barn or warehouse. A lone bell tower climbed above the rooftop, the only distinguishing feature to separate the chapel from the town's other buildings. The bell rang out in observance of another day. Celebration wasn’t on Sholeh’s mind. She couldn’t bring herself to join the voices and stood outside as light claimed the morning skies. Other bells tolled across the port, marking the start of the day. The echoes of the human voices joined in song faded as the creaky door swung open. Men and women covered in the drab of ordinary workers headed forth into the city. The priest of this flock wore long black robes that hung in the dirt in the street. A plain leather belt wrapped around his stout middle. The only adornment to the simple garb was a thin red line at the edge of each sleeve and the hem at his feet. “Greetings, sister. The morning light shine upon your face.” Sholeh’s feet froze in place as ice pumped through her veins. The voice pushed against her memories. Forgotten memories. “May the morning glow light your path.” The priest raised his eyebrows at the traditional response to the formal morning prayer. He tucked his hands into the cuffs of his robes. “A sister far from home. Returning to the church?” Sholeh broke her gaze from the man and looked at the squalid building and the slipshod work. Coming home. Had her life come to this? “No. I still need to find what I am looking for.” “The goal of all people is to discover their place in a greater plan.” “What happens if we never find it?” The priest fidgeted with his belt. The theological debate was unusual in the town’s streets. “But the quest itself is the journey, sister. How could it be otherwise?” “The quest must have an ending. Every journey needs a goal.” “The goal would be eternity.” “But at what cost to your soul?” Words tumbled out faster than she could control them. Years ago, she left this behind to find herself. And now she was arguing with the church again. “You must seek…” The words trailed off as the priest took another step closer. “Sholeh?” “By all that is good and holy…” “It is you. The wayward daughter is found.” “Baris? Of all places.” “I passed my test and earned the red ring. I tend to the souls here.” “Of all places.” “Your father will be overjoyed—\" “Baris, you can’t report this.” “We’ve searched across the Empire.” “Keep looking.” “He will want to know.” “He cannot. I will not be here long enough for a message to get to him. Do you wish to let my father know you lost me?” “I don’t understand.” “You cannot. Things are complicated.” “Then explain.” Sholeh’s eyes moved from the church back to the preacher. He was genuine, and the concern dated back to a time when they were children. She shrugged out of his grasp. “I cannot. I am sorry.” She spun on her heel away from the dumbfounded priest and strode down the street. She dared not look back. Her feet followed the sounds of the pounding hammers. The ring of the steel slowed her heart and settled her soul. A different home. As she walked in, one worker grounded her hammer and wiped the grime of her hands on the leather apron. The apprentice working the bellows behind her took a thankful pause from the unrelenting work. “What do you need?” The brown eyes sized up Sholeh with the practiced look of a hardened businesswoman. She rested her hand on the counter dividing the forge from the rest of the shop. Muscles rippled, and sweat covered the bare forearms. No stranger to the anvil. “I need work.” “Swing hammers before?” “Yes.” “I can’t pay you until I see your skill. No pay for a week and no guarantees for pay afterward.” Sholeh’s shoulders slumped forward. She couldn’t let this offer defeat her. It was better than any she’d gotten since their escape. “Take it or leave it.” The woman turned to her forge, and the apprentice pumped the bellow to bring the flames back to life. Sholeh picked up a leather apron pocked with burns and stained with sweat. She strode into the heat of the forge and tested the weight of the hammers. “I need three pounds of nails. Two-inch length.” Sholeh didn’t say another word to the apprentice-level work. She hammered out her frustration on the yielding iron. How would she explain the day to Kincaid?",

      "title": "Kincaid - Visitors",
      "content": "Kincaid - Visitors His soul labored with the scars of his magic. A deep, dreamless sleep didn’t drive away the fatigue. Not this fatigue. His body groaned from a night on the drafty room’s frigid floor, and the pain was deeper than his muscles and his bones. This is what it feels like to be old. The thought of aging before his time from his power wracked his mind with awful memories. The image of Vedette Atros, the youngest child of the powerful House of Atros, clinging to life in her ancient body lying in the street seared into his mind’s eye. He turned away from those terrible images. They wouldn’t be his future. Sholeh’s bed was tidy, neat, and empty. Although his sleep was restless, he couldn’t recall her dressing to leave before dawn. Kincaid shook his head and hoped she wasn’t laboring at another day job. They needed time to plan to spend his small winnings and get out of here. But first, breakfast. His stomach reminded him they survived on one meal a day to stretch their last coins. He kicked his blankets to the corner of the room and tightened his belt. Drafts from the approaching winter raced through the common area and caused the fire to flicker and sputter. The floor creaked with his footsteps. Too few nails in lumber any carpenter would reject. At least the area was empty after the laborers responded to the morning bells. He ran a copper penny between his fingers as he gestured to the working staff. As he took his perch in the corner on an uneven stool that rocked with his weight, a blast of approaching winter air surged from the main door. Two men stepped through the opening and slammed the door shut behind them. Their eyes probed the inn’s main floor and glared into each shadow. Each wore thick padded armor painted with a checkerboard of red and white squares. Belted swords and daggers hung at each hip, and both carried a long spear. Rather than rest their spears and settle into seats, one turned to open the door again. The common room staff didn’t appear scared, only curious. Quite a show. In a moment, a man and a woman strode in from the street. Neither bore the hardened looks of warriors nor carried an array of weapons. They were more dangerous. These two had the haughty air of nobility. Disgust for the inn was visible across the room. Kincaid considered his options for escape. He had none. Any movement to the stairs back to his room would draw the attention of the alert guards, and slipping out the door was impossible as he’d have to approach the noble guests. He kept his head down and traced the grain of the wood on the table. The nobles stepped to the bar to summon the owner, and Kincaid couldn’t decipher the words out of the voices' low rumble. Guards moved deeper into the room and took notice of the single patron waiting for breakfast. The door opened a last time, and two more guards entered. Both wore the same coat of arms. Six to one. They couldn’t be looking for him. He wasn’t worth that much attention. Unless they were from Atros, but the guards from Atros wore red with golden lions. Kincaid fought to control his heart rate under the scrutiny. The intensity of the stares didn’t change; they viewed him as a threat. The exchanged words were low but insistent as the man and woman probed for information. None of the people at the bar turned toward Kincaid, but the flow of conversation demanded answers. Kincaid summoned a trickle of arcane energy, fighting back the rush that hungered to claim his soul. With the smallest stream of power, the young wizard pushed his senses out to the edges of the room. The stiff padded armor crunched from the weapons' weight on the belts, and the thick boots squeaked against the loose floorboards. The guards’ breathing were normal as they conducted their duties. They didn’t view Kincaid as a threat. He forced his hearing to the conversation with the barkeep, and the words stopped in mid-sentence. The man and woman spun toward Kincaid. Each summoned a channel of their strength and shoved the force of magic back toward him. Kincaid’s heart raced as he faced the wizards. Their power was deep and honed to precise levels. His flow of magic was crude compared to their touch of the arcane. And they could toss aside his childish efforts with their magic. Kincaid’s expanded senses collapsed around him. The woman and a man approached Kincaid. The halo of power surrounded their bodies as they waved off the guards. Pausing two steps away, they sized up Kincaid. He straightened his back, raised an eyebrow, and endured their gaze. Their clothes were less garish than the red and white checkered armor of the escorts, but their clothes were also unique. Each wore long robes from their necks to an inch above the floorboards. The fine silk material fell perfectly across their bodies and flowed as they walked. Even the ruling houses of Caesea had a limited supply of this imported material. Their garment's right sleeve was sky blue, and each had gold thread, less than an inch wide at their wrists, and the opposite sleeve carried the red and white checkered pattern of the guards. The middle of the clothing was forest green with a competing inch of gold at the bottom. Both wore crafted leather belts with only an eating knife and a pouch. They approached the table and stopped by the remaining chairs. “A moment of your time, wizard?” The man’s voice gave away his teenage years with a squeak at the end of the sentence. His body was older—the price of magic. Brown eyes probed into Kincaid’s soul. Kincaid gestured to the two chairs in front of him with an open palm. The young magi remained seated as they joined him at the uneven table. “Why use magic against us?” The woman was to the point and more guarded than her companion. “You should have known we would feel the push of power.” “We’d have to respond,” the man said. “I didn’t know you used magic.” The pair glanced at each other, and the stone mask of interrogation slipped from their faces. The chairs creaked and groaned as they shifted their weight. Kincaid was relieved the guards with their weapons and armor didn’t join them as they would crush the chairs. “You couldn’t tell by our rank?” The question was bait, but Kincaid didn’t have a choice. “I’ve never seen those uniforms before, and I don’t understand what you mean by rank. But your conversation at the bar worried me.” “Don’t the laws of this city punish magic with execution?” The woman’s voice was low but directive. “Yes, and they’ve tried. But the city is busier with other things than a poor immigrant.” “I see your point.” The man nodded in an annoying all-knowing fashion so typical of nobility. “We do not come from the city or represent any of the misguided noble houses. But I should ask first, are you sorceratti?” the woman asked. Kincaid snorted. “Absolutely not. Do I even look like a native Caesean?” “There have been indiscretions in the past. Not of the sorceratti, of course.” The man’s voice shifted into a lecturing tone. For a moment, Kincaid missed the words of Magi Cormac. Kincaid couldn’t figure out why people always needed to explain things to him. “I am Petre, first rank of the Theurgia, hecaerae.” “And I am Tereza, second rank of the Theurgia and the leader of his official expedition from Pilaetium.” Upon closer inspection, Kincaid noticed an extra thin braid of gold at the wrists of her robes. Kincaid sat quietly and waited for them to continue. None of the words made sense to him other than their names. Pilaetium was the Empire of a Thousand Spears' capital city, but the rest didn’t register to his former life as a journeyman carpenter. If they were trying to impress Kincaid with their titles, he would disappoint them. He waited them out. “Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the use of magic in the Empire of a Thousand Spears?” the woman, Tereza, asked. “I am.” “Ah, then we should start even farther back.” “The beginning would be fine.” Kincaid was short with his words, but the school lecture was too loud. If the barkeep or workers heard this conversation about magic, the town guard would hang them by morning. Or worse, they’d send him back to Caesea for punishment at the hands of Atros. “There are two schools for magic within Pilaetium. We were students at Theurgia and passed our tests there. We’ve stayed on with the school as full hecaerae, the wizards of the capital. Other schools exist throughout the Empire as gifted people find their place with their power. Still, none compare to the schools of the capital.” Tereza finished her lecture and waited for questions. “I’m sure.” Sounds likes the sorceratti. “You should understand we are here looking for wizards within Caesea.” The young woman leaned forward in her seat and locked her gaze with Kincaid. “Not just any wizards. Ones already proven with their abilities.” The man held a smirk on his face as if they were offering knighthood to the uninitiated. Maybe even the unworthy. “You must be powerful…” Kincaid fumbled with their word and then skipped ahead, “mages.” “No, we are only of the first and second rank. The leaders of the Theurgists are fifth rank. Their control of arcane power is far beyond our simple level.” Questions raced through Kincaid’s head. How could they practice their power without destroying their lives? They weren’t old enough and didn’t bear the scars of their magic he'd seen in Caesea. Kincaid’s confusion slipped into his wrinkled brow. Did Magi Cormac, once the instructor of magic for the entire city of Caesea, learn his magical secrets from the schools of the Empire? “We can answer so many more questions, Kincaid.” The man’s voice was insistent. “You can start by explaining how you know my name.” “How many wizards beyond the sorceratti are there in Caesea? Or perhaps I should ask, how many living wizards are there?” he said. “Fair question. Sounds like you’ve spent some time trying to find me.” “We have. But consider our words. You don’t have to live… here.” The woman gestured around the room and wrinkled her nose. “Enjoy your meal.” The male wizard summoned the workers to the lopsided table and pointed toward the empty spaces. They got up and left a silver piece on the bar top. Kincaid considered walking away from the food as the guards cleared the entrance and escorted the hecaerae out. But his stomach overrode his brain and made him think through this decision. He might as well eat while he had the chance.",

Red iron fell back from the steel onslaught driven by powerful arms. Sholeh longed for her old hammers. Each had a balance for the arc of her swing. With those tools, her swings were instinctive and true. Now she needed to focus on height and power of each blow. Once, she created art. This hammer was a crude tool. It was good enough for the stack of nails she was creating. She laid down the latest batch against the measuring board. Lining each up against the two-inch mark, she checked the length. Grabbing a pair of shears, she made precise cuts and added them to her pile. “She’s not going to check.” The voice was right by her ear, and the warm breath with the stink of old meat brushed the back of her neck. “Work must still be done right. Even when no one is watching.” Sholeh turned toward the young man. He’d been checking her out all morning. “You should slow down with that hammer. Relax a little. Get to know the people. You might find there are a few that want to help you.” He winked. Sholeh checked the heft of her hammer. One quick blow and this fool would be done with his advance. “You are offering to help?” “Oh, definitely.” His eyes roamed up and down her arms and settled on her chest. “Then deliver another stack of wood for my fire. Stoke the fires as I get the next set of nails ready. Now, if you please.” “There’s a price for this service, apprentice.” His words came through gritted teeth. “Be careful. The price may be more than you want to pay.” Sholeh squared her shoulders at the inexperienced man. He was tall for his age, a good head taller than Sholeh. He had the lanky figure of a young man not grown into his body yet confident in his size and strength. Sholeh wasn’t impressed. “You won’t last the week.” He turned away from the confrontation. His offer for “help” was already forgotten. Sholeh shook her head. She hadn’t been here long enough to earn enemies, and this shop was nothing like her forge on Caesea. The master kept enough work on their anvils that none had the time during the day to bother each other. Especially not harass each other. Sholeh pumped her bellows and added heat to the iron that waited its turn to become the simplest of tools, the nail. She longed for the time to craft weapons from fine steel or even repair the work of others. She wondered if she would graduate from spikes to horseshoes. “Nice work.” The woman who offered her the job examined the growing piles. “Each pile is a quarter pound of two-inch nails. I will have the rest done before dark.” “You aren’t an apprentice.” Sholeh gazed at the glowing metal waiting for the remainder of her work. She sighed and stopped. “No, I was a journeyman in Caesea.” The woman nodded. “I figured as much when you tested each hammer before you started. You knew what you were looking for.” “I can help here. But a week without pay—” “Wish I could change that. But we don’t take commissions and only pay as we go. I can offer twenty-five percent on your product today.” For nails? That’d be less than coppers for a day’s job. But more than what an apprentice would make. If she had her tools, she’d be able to ask for more. With no better options, Sholeh agreed. The woman nodded and returned to her tasks in the heat while the young man pumped the bellows but eyed Sholeh. She’d have to resolve his advances soon. Work continued through the afternoon as the anvils stayed busy. Sholeh ignored the hunger chewing at her insides. But the customers weren’t coming in for goods yet, and that meant her day’s effort wouldn’t yield a single penny. A curtain covered the entrance to the forge. It kept the drafts down and most of the heat in for the winter months. Sunlight poured into the workspace as the curtain threw open. A silhouette highlighted by the afternoon sun was all Sholeh could make out. With the leather fabric drawing closed, Sholeh observed a young woman standing at the counter, and she was alone and looked out of place in the smithy. Workers and servants came and did the work of those who had power and money, and this one didn't look like a laborer. In the flickering light of the flames, Sholeh noticed the uniform she wore. The long garments of the Empire with the white and red checkered sleeve representing the ruling classes. She had a blood-red sleeve on her right arm with the faintest thread of gold. Her robes were a deep black and clearly a student, not the fine silk of one of the masters. If she wasn’t mistaken, a student of Damis. “What do you need?” The lead blacksmith took care of the customers. The woman’s eyes scanned the forge and stopped on each worker. She wasn’t here for crafted metal goods. “I am looking for someone,” the young woman said. “This is a smithy…” The word trailed off from the intensity of the glare. The woman in the wizard’s robes didn’t need a reminder of what the shop did. “How long have these workers been working here?” “If you aren’t here to buy, then you can leave. We’re too busy.” Sholeh grounded her hammer and watched the red glow of iron dull to cool gray. She straightened her loaner apron and looked the hecaerae in the eyes. “What are you seeking, Hecaerae of Damis?” “It appears I found it.” The woman had young eyes but an older body, and she carried herself with the confidence of the Empire. “I gave you a profit share. You don’t need to walk out on me.” The lead smith tried to change the discussion. Neither woman paid her heed. Sholeh nodded to her employer and took off the apron. “I will be back.” “Not sure we’ll take you back.” The woman muttered and turned to her work at the anvil. The wizard gestured to the door and pulled aside the curtain to the afternoon air. Salty water blew off the harbor and chilled the sweat on Sholeh’s body. They walked away from the hammering of the forge. “I’m searching for a blacksmith who worked with the wizard in Caesea.” “Why are you looking for him?” “Are you admitting that you are the blacksmith?” Sholeh set her face and thrust her emotions into the pit of her stomach. She wouldn’t let this hecaerae push her around. She wasn’t in Pilaetium. Sholeh remained silent. “The wizard gained attention in the heart of the Empire, and the schools of magic are interested in what this magician from the west can do.” “The schools see him as a threat?” “The schools haven’t made an assessment yet. That’s why we traveled this far.” The woman stepped in closer. “I might arrange a meeting with the wizard, but the city is dangerous. The law demands execution of people who use magic.” “I am aware of these laws, and I do not think they apply. I’m an official delegate of the Empire and a member of the school of Damis.” “You do not know what happened in Caesea. A duel of wizards destroyed an island and harmed hundreds. The flicker of magic within the lands the city still controls will be met with force.” “Then, we will be careful.” The young woman’s half smile was not comforting. The schools would do what they wanted and wouldn’t respect the lives they threatened. The powerful in Pilaetium never did. And Kincaid would pay the consequences, again. “No. Careful is not enough. I will not help you.” “Foolish choice when I am the one offering help. Who else is reaching out their hand? And not in a fist?” “I think the wizard will do fine without your help.” “You should reconsider this choice, blacksmith.” Sholeh turned away from the woman and went back to the curtain. Boot steps ground in the cobblestone as the hecaerae turned away from Sholeh and strode down the street. Two signs from the Empire in one day. Beyond coincidence. They needed more than a plan to get out of the city. They needed to leave. Reality crashed down on her wild thoughts. Sholeh pulled up short as the young blacksmith waited on the other side of the curtain. He looked down at her with his lecherous grin. “A new girlfriend in your life? I was hoping you’d pick me.” “You must have work to do.” “Oh, I’m planning on it.” Sholeh had enough. Between the priest and the hecaerae, this fool would not be the one to tear down the rest of her day. She drew back a fist and landed the punch above the belt. The young man wasn’t prepared for the assault and lurched over. Her left fist caught the side of his face, and he dropped to the ground like a sack of firewood. He was on his knees, one hand scrabbling at the dirt floor while his lungs fought for a breath. Sholeh stepped around him and relit the flames of her forge. She pumped the bellows to the temperature of her rage. The shop paused only for a moment, and then the sound of steel on steel began again.",

      "title": "Bartalan - A Choice",
      "content": "Bartalan - A Choice “State your business.” Bartalan adjusted his black robes. He clenched his teeth and plucked at the thin gold thread at his sleeves. First rank was an accomplishment from years of study and training. Most students started before they became teenagers and waited years to take their tests. Bartalan finished the course of academics in just over two years. He should be second rank already. He brought his eyes up from his uniform and assessed the five thick golden braids of a powerful hecaerae. Not just any hecaerae, but the head of the Damithians. The fifth order hecaerae and center of arcane power for Pilaetium. This hecaerae was a native of the Empire and started his academics by the age of eight. Every student knew his story. He passed the tests and took his place among the first ranks by thirteen. Everyone thought the school slowed his education because Pilaetium couldn’t accept a pre-teen wizard with arcane power at his whims. Now he was a wizened old man with glasses perched at the end of his nose. He kept his scalp shaved and his face clean to avoid the iconic image of the ancient mage with a flowing white beard. But his leathery skin, gnarled fingers, and gravelly voice gave away the toll on his body. His eyes held a different story. Those eyes could peer through deception and gaze into the heart of the soul. No student wanted the summons to this office for discipline. Those eyes and experience could cut through the best-crafted lie and discern the truth. None walked out getting the better of this hecaerae. “Your business?” The voice asked again with a tinge of boredom. For too many years, supplicants lost their crafted speeches on this spot. Even powerful wizards froze. “I wish to propose a change to our rules.” Sparing unnecessary conversation, the head of the Damithians gestured with his bent fingers to continue. “We’ve stood in the shadows of the city’s power for too long. We spar with Theurgia over the trivial rules for those with potential for magic. The church grapples with us over the morality and ethics of power, and even the Emperor wonders at how he can deepen control over the hecaerae.” “All true.” The wizened head bobbed. “We’ve waited too long. We should look at the edges of the Empire, maybe even beyond, to find new magicians. Restore the power of our line into this city. Take our place—” “And what do you think our place is?” The voice was firm. The act of the old mage was over. This was the leader of Damis. Eyes bored into the middle of Bartalan’s chest. He didn’t sense the master of the school summoning a thread of power. Bartalan plunged forward, “At the head of the table. At the head of the Empire.” “An overthrow?” “No, no. Nothing so bold as rebellion. The blood in the streets would boil from the battle with Theurgia alone. And the merchants would take the city, and then the Empire would not be worth ruling.” The old man nodded in understanding. But Bartalan couldn’t determine agreement. “What is your plan?” “A long view. A gentle touch on the balance of power in our favor. New blood in our ranks of wizards to explore the edges of magic. Not enough to threaten the order, but sufficient to make the fight worth the effort for us all. Imagine the powers we could discover.” “We could just as easily join forces with Theurgia and create the same result.” The words lashed the first order hecaerae like a thunderbolt—an alliance with Theurgia. “I don’t see how this would ever happen. What would they gain from second place in an Empire we controlled?” “They would stand with us, as equals.” The old mage probed. He’d considered this idea before. Bartalan couldn’t hide his emotions. His nose wrinkled like he smelled droppings from a cavalry unit. His head shook with the concept of teaming up with the other school to share power. “How could they be equals? They do not have the same interest in magic as we do.” “Pursuit of power is a dangerous game, Bartalan. The Theurgists offer a balance to the study of magic.” The wizard paused and let the words sink in. “The ends can’t always justify the means.” “I’m not proposing to abandon the games of power within the Empire. Perhaps I misspoke.” “I do not think you did.” “I wish to set fresh pieces on the board. Manage our position. Political and magical.” “Why would a first rank come to the heart of our order and propose these sweeping changes, Bartalan?” “Because we need to change. We’ve prospered under the rules of the Empire. There’s no doubt. Two schools of magic with vast wealth and influence over people. A power center unto ourselves and not tools in some bastard’s army.” “Change is good. It is the centerpiece of life. But for what end?” “There’s more in the magic. More that we can learn. We don’t understand the depths of this power. I’m afraid I won’t be able to find it within the confines of our rules. “Interesting. To change the rules so you may find out more about your magic?” Bartalan broke the gaze of the master. He looked around at the collection of wealth and knowledge in this room. For at least a decade, this man stood at the head of their power center. He’d managed two different emperors and worked on control of the young pup thrust into the center of power just two years ago. Many books in this room were written in his hand. Theories and proposals. But little practical knowledge. A few nights ago, magic spoke to Bartalan in ways he couldn’t explain. Theories were interesting, and they made for great test questions for aspiring students. But magic wasn’t a theoretical game. It was power. “Not my magic. All magic. There is more, and we should find it.” The wizened man adjusted his frail weight in the cushions of his chair. He propped his arms on the elaborately crafted desk. The thick gold stripes on his sleeves went halfway up his forearms. “Bartalan, I cannot approve these changes. I will not threaten the years of progress magic has made in the Empire. I don’t know who is whispering these thoughts into your head about these changes, but you should study the role this school has played in the Empire's history. Perhaps you missed that in your studies.” Bartalan checked the bubbling anger in the pit of his stomach. The old man couldn’t see the changing world around them. They could find a new place in the Empire. And perhaps even beyond. “By your leave.” The master nodded. Bartalan spun on his heel and burst out of the room. He’d show them a new level of study.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Reminders of the Past",
      "content": "Kincaid - Reminders of the Past A fist thundered on Kincaid’s door. He wiped the sleep out of his eyes and threw his pants and shirt over his small clothes. Kincaid glanced back to the empty bed and their lack of belongings before he pulled open the door. “No more promises. Pay now, or you are out.” The evening meal’s preparation smeared the man’s dirty apron. His meaty right fist carried a club. Kincaid clenched his jaw until his mouth hurt. The man wasn’t extorting him; he wanted the money owed to him. But coming up to the room in the middle of the afternoon with a club was a bit much. He didn’t think they were that far behind. “I’ve got some money now. It should be enough.” “Pay what you owe, or you’ll be looking for a comfortable rock for a pillow in the streets.” They weren’t living in the lap of luxury, and he was sure this man couldn’t find a pillow in a lineup of furniture and linens. But Kincaid had to do something. He couldn’t tell Sholeh that he’d failed again. Not today. He reached for his bag of earnings, and the jingle of coins changed the man’s expression. The fist relaxed, and the club pointed toward the ground. A true man of business. “What do we owe you?” “All of that.” “That’s outrageous.” “You owe for the room, the food, and the late fee.” “You’re robbing us.” Kincaid kept the smolder out of his voice as he looked at the man stealing the last vestiges of his escape plan. “You’ve been taking from us. Staying in our rooms, eating our food, avoiding me when the rent is due. Consider this my last offer to you. I could always send you off to the watch. Let you spend some time in debtor’s prison. Pay up.” Kincaid didn’t have options. A confrontation with the local law would lead him back into the arms of Caesea. He would not go back to jail again. Even if it cost him his soul. He handed over the bag of wealth. Kincaid felt his dreams disappear as the weight left his hands. The owner’s head bobbed as he fingered through the contents. “Enough there to cover my ‘late fee’?” “Yes, yes.” The counting went on, and the man looked back at Kincaid. “Enough for two more days here.” Kincaid’s mouth dropped. “There’s enough in there for a month. With food.” “Not when you are weeks behind. Find some real work. Stop getting beat up at night and find a place for your wife.” The man’s tone was softer. Almost as if he felt bad for the young wizard. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that.” “Try harder.” The man turned away and tucked the bag under his apron. Kincaid closed the door and shifted to the dump they called a room. He couldn’t get ahead in the lands of Caesea. Everyone established their position of power over others. Even an innkeeper pushed to control the life of at least one person. Kincaid reached under the pile of linens and grabbed his second pouch of coins. Coming home with a black eye and the confrontation this morning was enough warning that the owner would look for his due. The young wizard divided his earnings into two piles and hid a quarter of the wealth. They’d get through a few more weeks, but they would never get ahead. Kincaid stepped outside the inn and gazed toward the horizon of the setting afternoon sun. He longed for the easier days when he had a trunk packed with warm clothes, and he missed the room stocked with furniture he’d crafted with his hands in his spare time. His dirty sleeve wiped across his eyes before they left trails of water on his cheeks. He worried about Sholeh. They already sold off their most valuable possessions, and the day jobs they struggled to keep weren’t enough to let them live. Never mind escape. Sholeh took all of this personally. She’d tried to save him. Kincaid knew his solution couldn’t be magic. The small redhead couldn’t appear in more fights without getting thrown out the door. Options were few. But he couldn’t let them starve. His feet took him toward the docks. People scurried under the weight of loads to and from ships. Shouts echoed across the piers and sounded like gulls in the distance. Kincaid had to commit himself to the backbreaking work. Maybe a ship captain would take notice of his work and offer a job. Kincaid dodged to the side of the street and paused at a storefront. Red cloaks with the golden lion of Atros paced among the dockworkers. Four soldiers methodically questioned the masses. How hard would it be to find a red-haired immigrant in this port town? Not time to take those chances. A nearby bar provided cover with crowds gathered under the overhang near the door. Onlookers pointed and murmured. Another group approached the dock with armed guards pushing through the crowds. Flashing amidst the everyday workers’ dark clothes were the bright red and white checkered arms of the Empire's soldiers. This group had the pair of wizards from the inn in trail. The crowd parted as the two groups faced off. No slither of drawn steel; no sense of summoned magic. Kincaid admitted they’d need to pull a torrent of magic for him to sense the surge at this distance without touching the arcane plane himself. Kincaid decided against a nudge of wizardry. No reason to draw attention to himself. Yet. Hands gestured as the groups talked, but none moved toward weapons. The two wizards knew where Kincaid and Sholeh were staying. If those hecaerae and Atros joined forces... He’d feel better if he knew what they were saying. Interest in the conversation faded. Onlookers had work to do, and without a fight, none would stay interested in the discussion. The main street was busy with day laborers making their way to the docks. Captains finished the preparation for a morning departure and still needed manual labor to get things done. Throwing caution aside, Kincaid joined the end of the group and considered his plight. He’d find out what the groups were discussing, but he’d be in line for a day of heavy work under the scrutiny of a master stevedore. There had to be more to his life than running away from powerful factions and tedious labor. His group queued up at the ropes by the dock. The Porters’ Guild ran the entry to the piers and filtered the men and women who could do the labor and those who wanted charity. No place for loafers with the unending pace of the tide. A Porters’ Guild guard stood with crossed arms and a deep scowl. His shaved head revealed a puckered scar from his left eyebrow to the back of his skull. Life on the docks wasn’t easy. With one finger, he gestured people forward or indicated they should get out of line. First officers sized up the ones moving forward and got them to work. The Guild would get their dues at the end of the day. Kincaid’s plan was already coming apart. He couldn’t hear the discussion between the groups at this distance, and he’d be revealed to the Atros guards once he got to the front of the line. He needed the coin from the day’s work, and he longed to pick up the exchange. This wasn’t working. The line shuffled forward, and the foreman scrutinized each hopeful worker. He grunted acceptance and scowled rejection. At least the guards weren’t paying attention to the prospective workers. One of the hopeful men received a deep scowl, and the rejected man limped back to the line of bars. The former carpenter left the line and walked away from his failed effort to learn more about the conversation. He couldn't take the chance. At least shouts didn’t follow Kincaid’s departure. The normal shanties serving liquor and pleasures to the transient sailors lined the docks. None made enough money to invest in infrastructure, and Kincaid’s training as a carpenter recoiled from the shoddy work. The next major storm would send the wood into the sea. Kincaid huddled under the overhang of the nearest structure and mixed in with others from the rejected workforce. He let the powers of magic trickle into his soul and reached out with his heightened senses. A terrible gamble. But he needed the information from this encounter. Neither he nor Sholeh could afford to be oblivious to this possible union of interests. “Magic is against the law in the lands of Caesea.” The leader of the guards wasn’t confrontational, just factual. “We are emissaries from the Empire of a Thousand Spears, and we are familiar with your laws,” the male wizard, Petre, spoke. He tucked his hands into the cuffs of his sleeves. The gold trim flashed in the rays of the sun. “Using magic within your lands is the farthest thing on our minds. Neither of us would dare to challenge the standing laws of Caesea. We can use magic, but we won’t.” The female wizard, Tereza, kept the same measured tone as her male partner. Kincaid breathed a sigh under his breath. They were true to their word, and they wouldn’t detect the trickle of power he was using, especially at this distance. He refocused his efforts. “We will have to report your presence here. The City Council will want to know of your arrival and will expect you to present your credentials.” “We won’t be staying long. We are simply passing through your lands.” Petre paused for a moment and looked over the rank and insignia of the head guard of the Atros contingent. “I don’t recognize your symbols. Different than the city.” “We belong to the House of Atros.” “I see. And I’ve heard the House of Atros passed the responsibilities of leadership to a new house. A Duchess.” Tereza’s words weren’t an accusation, just a report of hard facts. The lead guard took the statement like a physical blow. The bodyguards from the Empire tensed in response but made no move. The slight to their honor could escalate to an insult. No one needed bloodshed on the docks. “Your information is accurate. Why are you here, if not to visit the City Council?” The guard’s formality seemed out of place in the docks of the city. Kincaid wondered how the upper ranks of society enjoyed speaking to each other in stilted phrases. “We were looking for a wizard.” The woman dropped the phrase like a cannonball in their midst. “As are we.” “Then the rumors must be true about the battle on your islands. People here on the shore still speak of the strange lightning and explosive thunder from the main city.” Tereza’s voice was laden with subtle accusation. “The wizard escaped, and we continue the search. We will bring him to justice. Perhaps we could join forces in this search?” “Unlikely.” Petre dismissed the proposal with a wave of his hand. “Our goals are not the same.” “Then we would ask for your information, as a favor to the House of Atros.” “You can’t offer us anything that we want. We wish you the best of luck with your search. We’ll be gone in the morning, so the City Council will not have to worry about a pair of wizards in your lands.” Petre’s tone was dismissive to the guards from Atros. “If you excuse us, we need to make our way to our ship.” The party from the Empire slipped past the impromptu barricades left up by the Porter’s Guild. People leaped to prepare a skiff to take the pair out to their waiting ship. They’d seen enough of this backwater port. The guards from Atros scanned the workers still waiting to pass muster and the scrutiny of the Porters’ Guild. The line of remaining workers was short enough that the guards from Atros would take their search off the docks and push inland. Bars would be the first stop. He also didn’t want them noticing his shock of red hair moving back up the mainland streets. Instead, Kincaid slipped inside the door and found himself awash in the stench of humanity. Hard labor and meager wages found company in the cheapest places. Filthy glasses, wooden mugs, and dirty bowls made their rounds. The rumble of low conversations filled the bar. The tone would be different at night, and Kincaid wouldn’t want to be here at nightfall. He slipped his compact frame through the crowd and made his way toward the back door of the bar. Places like this didn’t have just one entrance or exit. They’d want people to get in and out easily, and some of these patrons needed discretion. The guards would continue their search through the town. Kincaid tried to guess how much time he had left before someone tipped off Atros, or they accidentally came across him.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Escape without a Plan",
      "content": "Kincaid - Escape without a Plan “You won’t believe—” “What happened to me today…” Sholeh cocked her head to one side, and Kincaid stopped his sentence with a broad grin on his face. Perhaps a hot meal was enough to raise their spirits. The young magi wished it was because their fortune had turned. Sholeh and Kincaid sat in the corner of their dingy inn, sharing a simple supper of watery stew and day-old bread. The innkeeper had been good to his word, and the agreement paid for the meager meal. “You first,” Kincaid gestured with his wooden spoon and then attacked his bowl of stew. Worse than he imagined, but they couldn’t afford the luxury of spices or salt. “I went out to look for work, and I ran into someone I knew from the Empire.” The spoon paused in the air before Kincaid’s mouth. He put the food back into the bowl and looked into her eyes. “Someone randomly remembered you? After four years away from the Empire?” Sholeh crossed her hands behind her bowl. “Yes. Not just anyone. The priest of the church here remembered me from when I was younger. He was an apprentice.” “What are the odds of that?” “About the same as finding out my friend is a powerful magi.” “Good point. What will he do?” “That makes me afraid, Kincaid. If he sends word back to the Empire that I am here, people will come looking.” “I thought you were just another immigrant searching for skilled work.” “I am, but the rest of the story is for another time.” Kincaid wrestled with the revelation. In the past, Kincaid and Sholeh had been very close. Their relationship took on a new intensity when Kincaid’s imprisonment and assumption of arcane power thrust them into the crucible of change. They’d became close again, fought the noble houses, dared to raid prisons, and faced every challenge side by side. And yet, there was so much more the young man didn’t know. He couldn’t read her face now, and that bothered him. “We are out of time anyway, Sholeh. I was scrounging for work and headed down to the docks. A group of guards from Atros is looking for me. They’ll find us.” Kincaid attacked the meal before it got cold. “By all that is holy, we don’t have enough to get away from this place yet.” “We can always walk away from here and try another town.” “But we will be in the same situation. Hiding and delaying for money we are unable to raise. We will not be closer to any goal.” “It’s worse, though, Sholeh.” He reached across the table to hold her hands. She reached back to him, and Kincaid brushed the raw spots and roughed callouses in her palms. She’d worked hard today. “There were two wizards from the Empire—” “Two?” “Yeah, a man and a woman. Why?” Sholeh shook her head. “What were they wearing?” “Robes. Expensive ones. Why?” Sholeh shook her head and held up her hand to hold back the questions. “What did the robes look like?” “Red and white checkered on the sleeve.” “That is the official symbol of the Empire. What about the other sleeve?” “Blue. Kind of light, like the sky. The rest of the robes looked green. Awfully bright for travel around Caesea.” “By all that is holy, Theurgia.” “What’s Theurgia?” “One school of magic in the capital. Kincaid, a wizard from Damis approached me.” “I don’t know what that is either.” “The competing school of magic in the capital.” “We were both approached by the schools of magic from the Empire?” “Not the only schools. The most significant ones.” Kincaid lost his appetite. His beer remained untouched as he looked around the room. If anyone were taking unusual notice of them, he’d be ready to leave tonight. Kincaid always expected the pressure would tighten on them, but he assumed they’d have enough time to slip out. Instead, they were in the middle as the jaws of a trap slammed closed. “What did this wizard from…” “Damis. We call them Damithians.” “Ok, Damis. What did this wizard from Damis want with you?” “She was looking for a blacksmith known to accompany a wizard from Caesea.” “How could a word travel to the Empire so fast?” “The timing would be about right for a fast ship to reach Pilaetium, make a decision among the institutions, and send investigators forward.” “The wizards confronted me here in the inn.” “They were talking to you?” Sholeh’s meal was still untouched. “Yes, you didn’t let me finish. I felt like I was going through an interview with them. To see if I was worthy enough to enter their school.” “You would be the first to do so, if true.” “I don’t understand.” “I will explain more later. We need to be moving away from here soon, my friend.” “A priest who remembers you, an angry house closing in on our trail, and two schools of wizards figuring out what I can do. I’m sure we don’t want to stay here. At least the wizards from Theurgia wouldn’t cooperate with Atros. I listened to that discussion on the docks.” “Their interests do not align. Theurgia wants to know more about wizards in the areas of the west. Atros wants to kill us both.” “Thankful for little things, I guess. Tell me about your wizard.” “My wizard was a woman. I did not think she was old enough to pass the tests looked for the blacksmith with the wizard. From what you have told me, both schools of magic are now looking for you.” “I need this school, Sholeh. But what do I do about both schools looking for me?” Sholeh sat and chewed the inside of her cheek, and Kincaid secretly wished his ability involved reading minds. Life would be so much easier. “I do not have a good answer. But I’m concerned about deciding without understanding what is going on in the Empire.” “They’ll use me?” The corners of Sholeh’s eyes were wet as she nodded. “Then we make our way and figure this out. Together.” Sholeh reached forward and gripped Kincaid’s hands as she blinked away the tears before they became streams down her cheeks. “I wish I understood why in one day we ended up with so much attention.” “I can only imagine it was the tide. Change is coming, my friend. We need to be ready.” The spoons resumed scooping their dinner. They couldn’t afford to waste the money, and they’d need strength for the days ahead. The couple suffered the rest of their meal in silence.",

      "title": "Kincaid - An Offer",
      "content": "Kincaid - An Offer Their meal continued with tense silence. With each scoop of their basic fare and sip of watery beer, Kincaid and Sholeh watched the patrons and the shadows. The people in the common room were locals who usually spent their meager wealth on the same low-standard food. Sailors and travelers preferred more robust fare and cleaner abodes. Sholeh played with her spoon in the bowl. Only a few breadcrumbs remained from their dinner, and the warmth of a full belly was worth the stinging bruises on his face. She didn’t glance up into his eyes, and the scraping sound of the wooden spoon reminded him of the end of their options. Sholeh counted on him. Their situation forced him to try harder. He’d have to make enough money quickly to get them on their way to something else. If people were looking for Sholeh, she couldn’t go back to the smithy. If Atros ran into the other wizard, they’d zero in on their location. A few patrons made their approach into the bar to grab some food. Men and women needed cheap options with the few coins they might have left in their possession. Another day could bring a small bag of cash to the barkeep. The cycle would continue as people lived paycheck to paycheck. Kincaid couldn’t break out of that cycle. Someone new entered the bar and approached the owner to trade some words. The barkeep nodded and pointed toward Kincaid and Sholeh as the woman turned to glance in their direction. She flung a coin to the barkeep and strode across the distance as jet black hair tied back into a ponytail bounced with each step. Blue eyes cut through the haze of the poorly vented fireplace and locked onto the couple. Kincaid reached across the table and gripped Sholeh’s forearm. He glanced toward the advancing woman, and Sholeh followed his gaze. The woman carried a long blade at her left hip with an elaborate bell grip surrounding the pommel. A heavy dirk with a wide crossguard hung at her right hip. The scuffed belt, worn weapons, and confident walk reminded Kincaid of the blademasters of Caesea. At least she wasn’t wearing the golden lion of Atros. Her loose shirt tucked into her belt was deep red, almost the color of dried blood. But the cut was perfect for allowing her to move without restraint. Her leather pants inserted into well-traveled, knee-high boots. Kincaid wondered if she spent time at sea as a pirate. “Mind if I pull up a seat?” The accent was distinct from the locals of Caesea. From the Northern States. Kincaid gestured with his left hand toward the empty seat in an invitation. As the woman slid into the chair next to him, Kincaid hoped she couldn’t draw that blade while sitting. Even the dirk would be difficult to wield. Kincaid’s heart pounded, but he relaxed the tension in his shoulders. “How’s the beer in this place?” “This must be your first time in this inn.” Kincaid’s voice was more confident than he felt. The warrior snorted as she looked around the room of the inn. “Well, I wouldn’t come here for the food, the beer, or the décor. Must be the company.” Her eyes swung back to the couple. “The beer is terrible, the foodstuff is worse, and we wish to know why you are here.” Sholeh wasn’t impressed with the recent arrival and let it show. “Then let me buy you a round of something better.” The woman slid back out from behind the table and walked back to the bar. She leaned forward and spoke in a low tone to the barkeep. “Another coincidence, Kincaid?” Sholeh kept her voice above a whisper, but the insistence split the distance between them. “She’s not trying to kill us.” “We do not know that yet. What if she is after a bounty on you?” “Her blade won’t stop me.” Kincaid stopped the discussion as the woman turned back to the pair and nodded. She made her way across the room and sat down. “I get it. You’re wondering why I am sitting down with you.” Sholeh and Kincaid answered with silence. “Look, I don’t care about your background. The barkeep said you’re out of money, and I’m short two swords for my company. My caravan leaves in a day, and I’m out of options.” She leaned back and crossed her arms across her chest. “I am a smith, trained in Caesea.” The woman raised her eyebrow. “We can use a smith. Keeping gear ready on the road will be good. We might get the other companies to throw some money into the pot.” “You?” “Carpenter, also trained in Caesea.” “We can do the same thing with the woodwork on the caravan. Might be a chance to earn a few more coins for the company. But I need swords. I’m not getting paid to bring logistics to the expedition. Ever a hold a sword?” “Hammers.” “That might work.” “Yes, I’ve trained with swords.” Sholeh shot Kincaid a look of disgust. “But we’ve sold everything we have to make payments for our lives. Not much left but what we have on our backs.” “That could come out of your payment. I provide weapons, you use your skills as a blacksmith and carpenter, and you sign up with my company to travel. Gear comes out of your fee. Food as well.” Kincaid and Sholeh traded glances. With the threats closing in, this could be their ticket out of the reach of Caesea. Even better, it could get them to the Empire without committing to either school of wizards. There had to be a catch. “What is your name?” Kincaid asked. “Adelaise the Red.” She gave a shallow bow from her waist while seated at the table. “Captain in the Guild of Blades.” “You are young to be a captain, Adelaise the Red.” Sholeh still wasn’t convinced. “Some of us have capabilities beyond our years. Wouldn’t you agree?” Her eyes didn’t leave Sholeh. Kincaid and Sholeh traded glances. They reached a silent agreement through the desperate nature of their situation. “Agreed.” Kincaid extended a hand. “When do we leave?” Adelaise gripped his forearm. “Day after tomorrow. East road by the church. The wagons form up before dawn, but you will report to me. Don’t let the other companies push you around. And don’t be bantering with the merchants; they’ll throw you out of the convoy in a heartbeat.” “Understood.” “And stay out of trouble here. You’re not registered with the guild, and you won’t have any protection.” Kincaid wondered what trouble they might find.",

      "title": "Adelaise - A Deal",
      "content": "Adelaise - A Deal “You owe me.” “I do.” The mercenary captain reached into her belt and withdrew a small sack of money. Adelaise kept her company paid on time and her people fed, and this was an expense she didn’t need before the caravan left. “Right where you said I’d find them.” “I don’t need your money.” The woman wrinkled her nose as if she smelled sour milk. “But you said—” “You owe me. A favor. In the future.” A deal with a wizard was never an agreeable thing. Even worse when they were acting on behalf of one of the schools. The Blade Guild wouldn’t be able to protect her if she got crosswise with this hecaerae. “What do you want with the girl?” “Nothing. It’s the boy.” Adelaise relaxed in one of the finer inns in this town. The Rose and Anchor served fine wine and hearty food. The seats had cushions, and none of the furniture felt like it would collapse. The fare would be better in the Empire's capital, but for a port town, this was satisfying. Merchants from the caravan already left for their rooms, and the remaining wealthy patrons nursed the end of their wine bottles. Two women wouldn’t attract attention in this bar, and the owner prided herself on discretion. Business deals and agreements happened in the main room. Private discussions could happen out of the sight of the law and other patrons. Adelaise didn’t need this level of discretion with her informant. “Why are the Damithians interested in the boy?” “Do you always ask these questions? I would think sellswords were fine with payment and a direction to point their weapons.” “I’m the one doing the paying right now. As the customer, I’d like to know more.” She tried to keep the sarcasm out of her voice, but it was too late. “The boy means nothing to me, but he’s close to the girl.” “I think our business here is complete. You asked for help to find the smith, and you found her. You owe me a favor, sellsword.” The woman got up and brushed off her robes. “Thank you for the wine.” Adelaise leaned back in her chair as the wizard departed. She didn’t like how this contract was evolving. Running a company for merchants to get their goods to the Empire before snow closed the passes was tough enough. But she came to the lands of Caesea on a different contract. The work just got more challenging with more interested parties. She could pull it off. Adelaise poured another glass of the red wine. Dry with subtle fruit flavors. The bottle was from a local vineyard. She'd have to remember this one for her next trip to Caesea. The thump of boots on the wooden floor approached from across the room. Weapons and armor jingled with each stride—another mercenary. So much for the discretion. Adelaise closed her eyes and shook her head. “What about my offer, Adelaise?” “Xenres, I just don’t see it happening.” Her fellow mercenary captain kept his thumbs tucked into the thick leather of his weapon belt. Sword and dagger hung in their scabbards. At least he didn’t make a move to sit. “You might change your mind. Getting involved with the damned wizards never helps our contracts.” A scowl deepened between his thick black brows, and his lips formed a tight line. “I’ve got a contract to run, and I have a company to prepare. And you should be following the rules about your contract.” “I don’t want any complications with the people you associate yourself with.” “You won’t buy me out.” “That’s not all—” “Shut up.” Adelaise’s relaxed pose had a steel core, and Xenres noticed the change in her posture. He pulled back a half step, and his left hand fingered the pommel of his blade. “Think about what you are doing, Adelaise.” “I’m not the one touching the sword.” Xenres took another step away from Adelaise and dropped his hands by his side. “Our companies will be on the road for a while.” He snarled the last words. Adelaise was up out of her chair in a blink. Her weight was forward on the balls of her feet. She’d practiced her draw so many times; she calculated she could end the fight before the buffoon cleared the blade from his sheath. She hoped his pig head knew that. “If you are going to threaten me, you should’ve brought a few friends.” “Not a threat, Adelaise.” The mercenary captain looked around the room with the commotion he caused. Looks like he would choose discretion. “But you should be staying away from those damn wizards. No good will come of it for any of us. And if the guild finds out…” There was the threat. “Even if they investigate, they’ll find nothing. I've filled my roster for our departure, just like you.” The man couldn’t come up with a farewell or snide comment. He turned and walked away. Adelaise looked toward the brown bottle with the local wicker weave around the base. Empty. That’s too bad. It would have made a better companion than the talk tonight.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Out of Options",
      "content": "Kincaid - Out of Options Kincaid’s breath came out in puffs of white vapor. He stamped his feet and rubbed his hands together as he waited for the morning sun to peek over the hills. They never had enough money for warm clothes. The crunch on the gravel grew louder as supplies and goods made their way into the wagons. Ropes creaked with secured loads, and springs groaned from the weight pushing against the axels—a fortune in goods from the craft masters of Caesea. Kincaid had no doubt the caravan would make an incredible profit, if they made it to the Empire. Which also meant security would be tight. Travelers would gravitate toward the convoy’s safety, and any of them could be lookouts for unsavory forces. The movement of wealth overland always attracted attention. If word leaked out to bandits, then the hired swords would fight. Kincaid wasn't a good swordsman. Sholeh positioned the entire caravan between her and the squat structure of the church. The encounter with the priest must have rattled her. She’d been silent about the cleric and what that might mean, but they had plenty of time ahead with the caravan duty. One company of mercenaries patrolled the growing line of merchandise and material. Kincaid peered into the pre-dawn gloom to see if the rest of Adelaise’s company assembled for muster. No sign of the red-shirted warrior. Without the captain to vouch for them, they’d be stuck in the coastal town “What do you think?” Kincaid slid up to his friend for warmth. Sholeh shivered in the morning air. Her eyes flicked to the church. “We can blend into this caravan. Take our cover as guards. It could work, my friend.” “But we know nothing about being guards. I’m a terrible swordsman, and you know it.” “We have a captain to back us up, Kincaid. We will be fine.” “Where is Adelaise?” Kincaid left the statement in the air. Frustrating. Five guards rubbing their arms to fight back the cold took notice of the couple. Without cover from their employer, the time to leave was past. They’d have to meet up with the company later. Kincaid slipped his hand into Sholeh’s and swung away from the caravan. They walked toward the docks and then curved down a side street close to their inn. When they were comfortably out of earshot of the guards, Kincaid brought up his concern. “Travelling with the group solves one problem, but what about the weather between the Empire and us? We’re leaving before the passes close with snow, right?” “Yes. We will see snow and some wind. Snow will already cover the mountains at the peaks.” “We’re not dressed for that, Sholeh. I’m pretty sure the merchants will not open their crates and give us a fur cloak. And I don’t think we will go to our captain and explain that we might freeze to death before we reach the Empire.” “What do we have left?” Kincaid fumbled with the purse at his belt. The weight was lighter than he hoped, and it was all they had left between them. He tossed her the bag. “We are paid at the inn for another day. We will eat tonight.” And then we return to starving again, Kincaid thought. The deal with the captain better hold. They couldn’t afford to pay their way. “Think we have enough to buy another set of warm clothes today?” “Let us find out.” Sholeh tucked their money into her belt and gave Kincaid a tight-lipped smile. The city streets were awake with the morning rush of day workers and shop owners plying their trades. Sholeh did not let go of Kincaid’s hand as they made their way to the cluster of tailor shops. As they turned the corner to Tailor Street, the jingle of armor and weapons rose above the normal morning noises of shops opening. A pair of guards entered Tailor Street from a side street. They wore the colors of Caesea and probably were customs agents. Probably. Kincaid squeezed Sholeh’s hand tight enough to make her grimace, and they stopped at the store on the corner. At least it was one of the coopers, and with the harbor and the departing caravans, the shop was busy. They found their way among the other patrons. “Atros is here too.” Sholeh heard his voice under his breath and responded with a squeeze. The red tabards with golden lions were too much for Kincaid to miss, and the guards were moving toward customers in the cooper’s shop. The pair made their way back toward the main road. Thankfully, no shouts followed them. Their only option was to head back to the wagons and blend in with the collection of foreigners there. Their pace was slow and meaningful, not a couple dodging suspicion. Once away from the intersection of the guards, Sholeh broke the silence between them. “By all that is holy, they are still looking for us?” “Yes. Atros is still searching, and they are closer. We can’t afford to stay here much longer.” They pulled up short on the main road. Kincaid pulled Sholeh off to the side. Another pair of guards from Atros was at the caravan's tail end, talking to the mercenary guards. No good options in this direction either. “Back to the room?” “They are searching this area now. How much time do we have left before they look through the inn? Or even ask the right question? The barkeep already sold us out once.” “We need to get outside of their search area.” Kincaid kept the warmth of Sholeh’s hand in his own. They stayed in motion, moving through the streets and staying near the crowds. As the morning turned toward lunch, the couple walked back toward Tailor’s Street. The crowds were gone, and so were the searching guards. They invested the last few pieces of their coins for warmer clothes. The caravan was their only option.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Caravan",
      "content": "Kincaid - Caravan Neither slept. Creaks set Kincaid and Sholeh on edge, and voices filtered through the floors startled them. Kincaid held his breath, waiting for guards from Atros to burst through their ramshackle door. By first light, Kincaid and Sholeh wolfed down the watery mess the inn had to start the day. Their packs with their few remaining belongings waited at their feet. One waterproof bag held all their wealth in the world. It was a pittance as they prepared to escort the loaded wealth to the Empire. The cloaks purchased the day before were worth the expense. Kincaid and Sholeh hid their faces under the deep hoods, and the warm fur held back the biting cold. A cloaked couple moving toward the caravan in the predawn light didn’t draw attention. Over thirty wagons stood in a neat row, lined up for departure. Each wagon was ready for travel with horses pawing the frozen ground, and their breath puffed in the morning air. Merchants checked their gear and tack one last time. Mercenaries and guards moved with a purpose around the caravan. Voices carried in the brisk morning. One company of mercenaries mounted on powerful steeds moved toward the front of the line. The skilled riders handled their charges as they waited for the order to start. Their tack jingled and creaked as the steeds stomped in anticipation of the move. Those dozen horses and their riders cost more than the collection of mercenaries gathering for muster. The rest of the caravan's guards were foot soldiers and archers. A train this size could attract attention, and the protection of nearly thirty warriors would deter all but the strongest lords. Fortunately, the procession was too small to be confused for an invading army. Kincaid hoped interested lords on the route of travel would just tax the caravan for passage and not waste the resources to attack. Sholeh and Kincaid made their way up the train to find their assembly area. Sholeh spotted the red banner limply hanging in the still air. They made their way through the growing crowd to the side of the wagons. Their boots crunched on the frost-painted grass. “Who do we have here? Vagabonds? Smugglers? I know, stowaways.” Kincaid glared at the man. He couldn’t pull his eyes away from the collection of rotted and crooked teeth grinning under lips too small for the cruel smile. “No, hired by Captain Adelaise.” “To do what, dig piss holes for us?” Sholeh laid a hand on Kincaid’s arm before he could clench his hands into fists. The man wore a shirt of chain mail over a stained, padded undershirt. Dirt from numerous campaigns scarred his weapons belt, and the long sword’s pommel was well-used. Not a fight they needed right now. “We are just going to find our captain and our place.” “Don’t think you children belong here in the caravan. I can find two real swords before this caravan heads out. Go home, now.” “I don’t need you interfering with my contract, Rafas. Let them pass.” “Adelaise the Bloody. Always coming up short. You must have done something special to make captain.” “Want to find out?” Adelaise didn’t break eye contact. The subtle changes in her stance didn’t go unnoticed by the veteran campaigner. The man looked from her stance to the weapons at her side. Adelaise wasn’t wearing armor, just her red shirt under a red cloak with black trim. “Fight here, in front of the merchants? Not a good way to start the trip, Adelaise. We can’t get fired before we start, right?” “Don’t make me look through the thieves and killers you’ve got in your squad, Rafas. And stay out of my company. You won’t like what you find there.” Adelaise spun away from the man and ignored the threat. Sholeh and Kincaid kept up with her pace away from the rival company. “Stay away from his company. I’ll make sure we work opposite sides of the caravan.” “What’s his problem with us?” “With the two of you, nothing. With me, everything.” She locked her gaze forward and kept moving. She wouldn’t share. The dozen men and women had the look of well-traveled warriors and carried their weapons with familiarity. As the trio approached, a few got to their feet and nodded toward their leader. It was a casual discipline, but it was clear to Kincaid who was in charge of this group. “Sholeh, Kincaid. Our company. These are our blacksmith and carpenter that will help along the way. I’ve also brought them along to fill out our swords.” The men and women nodded their recognition of the arrivals and went back into their pre-departure preparation of weapons, supplies, and gear. Adelaise pulled them off to the side. She crouched down and searched through a canvas sack like the seabags sailors carried to their ships. Adelaise found two square pieces of metal painted with bright red paint. These chunks could clasp a cloak, but they could also fasten around the neck or arm. She handed over the items and waited until they accepted the offer. Sholeh and Kincaid fumbled with their cloaks for a moment and replaced their clasps with their new company's symbol. Simple but effective insignia. “Good. Now we need weapons.” She grabbed a blade in a sheath and handed it to Kincaid. “You know how to put one of these on your belt, right?” “I trained with swords, Adelaise.” “Sure.” Kincaid grabbed the blade by the sheath and pushed aside his frustration. It wasn’t a long blade or a curved one for horseback. He had another two-foot blade. Why were women always giving him short swords? Sholeh held back a snicker as Adelaise raised an eyebrow. “Problem?” “I’m not sure what I’m going to do with this weapon on the caravan. I’m pretty sure I can’t call it a sword.” “You need to defend yourself. The people in this caravan are veterans of numerous campaigns. They’ve fought and killed, and they own their gear. Many are already members of the guild. If you walk around here with a sword strapped across your back, you will invite a fight you can’t win.” Kincaid shut his mouth. Further arguments were pointless given his first confrontation of the morning, and Kincaid secured the sheath to his belt on the first try. “I’m taking a chance with you, Sholeh.” Adelaise handed her a pair of hammers. These weren’t the work hammers of a smith. They had cruel ridges and a hooked back end. Weapons. The young smith looked at the offerings and nodded her thanks. She looped them into her belt. Kincaid shot a glance between the two women. Sholeh didn’t know Adelaise, and the sellsword captain wasn’t a native of the Empire. Why take a chance on her? Kincaid swallowed his pride and looked to the front of the caravan. “When do we move out?” Kincaid didn't want more embarrassing moments. “We’ll have a call for captains to turn in our rosters. When the riders head up the road, be ready to walk. Good boots?” “Good enough.” “We’ll find out.” Adelaise gave him a smirk and made the last check on the rest of her company. She started on her way to the lead wagon. Kincaid looked down at his worn work boots. They were the same ones Sholeh got him when he escaped from the Atros prison. He scrunched his toes in the leather to see how much room he had with his socks on. His feet slid just enough to let him know he’d have blisters before dark.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Contract",
      "content": "Adelaise - Contract A hand shot out from the concealment of a wagon. Before the gloved hand could reach the mercenary captain, she had the arm by the wrist and twisted. A whimper and a thud followed her quick move. Adelaise put a knee in the man’s back and wrenched the arm toward the sky. Maybe she’d wait for the horses to relieve themselves. “Let me up.” Not a command. Closer to begging. Good. Adelaise released the pressure. The man used his good arm to push his face up from the gravel and rubbed his sore shoulder. He pulled back the cloak of his hood to show enough of his face to let her know he wasn’t a foe. The captain stepped between the wagons and waited. “You’ve got her.” “I’ll deliver. I always do.” “What about the boy? There’s some interest going on in the capital about him.” “Would your masters like to rewrite my contract? It’ll cost more if you want guaranteed arrival for the boy. It’ll take a lot to keep them alive as it is.” “We’re paying you for safe arrival, Adelaise. You know the consequences if you fail.” Adelaise ground her teeth. “I know why your boss wanted me on this adventure.” “Good.” The toothy grin was back as he let go of his bruised shoulder. “I want to remind you with the long journey ahead that you have a great deal at stake.” “You should get out of here before someone else recognizes you.” “What makes you think I’m not part of this convoy, Adelaise? I can sign on with another company.” “Because the caravan is work. And it has an element of danger. Not your style. You’d rather try to move the pawns around the board and live in crappy insignificant towns.” “You should watch your tongue. I have no problem taking pawns off my board.” “Your boss wouldn’t be happy. I have actual work to do.” “Betraying everyone? I’ll bet you do.” Adelaise envisioned punching those front teeth out. The bell grip on her sword was perfect for a crushing blow to an opponent’s face. Thoughts of disposing the body crossed her mind as she considered how long she had before an unnecessary investigation started. She couldn’t afford the hassle with this one, and he’d be sending a message ahead that Adelaise was fulfilling her end of the contract. She spit out the next words instead. “Will you let me do my job, or are you going to keep standing there gawking at me?” Adelaise wished it was a better retort. “You should watch out for those damned wizards. There’s already too much interest in this caravan.” “What’s your charge?” “For the threat information? Nothing. Do your job, Adelaise the Red.” “Get out of my caravan.” The man doffed his hat, presented a theater bow, and swirled his long cloak around his lanky torso. He disappeared into the town. Spies were always trouble. Adelaise wondered how she got here. The end of a wagon caravan leading a haggard group of mercenaries to the capital city of the Empire. Sellsword, spy, blademaster, betrayer. She didn’t consider this part of her childhood dreams. Boots crunched in the gravel, and draft horses kicked up dust along the length of the procession. Adelaise wanted to get back upwind of the caravan’s stagnant stench, and she stayed away from Xenres and Rafas. Her competitors had their flaws as people and challenges as leaders, but they wouldn’t tolerate dealing with spies and the Empire's politics. Adelaise used to cherish the same beliefs. You find out what you value when it's threatened. Sometimes too late. Adelaise picked up her pace to double time. Her hands gripped her weapons to keep them from swinging around her body or slapping against her legs. The gathering of caravan leadership was only moments away, and the group hovered over a foldable table with maps organized across the surface. Hash marks covered the roads across the lands to Pilaetium. With a glance, Adelaise hoped they would make better time than what these merchants planned. Her practiced eyes gauged the distances for each day’s journey. If they rolled at the projected pace, an army could muster ahead of them and wait for them in a mountain pass. They’d also race against the weather in the heights of the passes. Not a good plan. The captains reported in with their mustered strength. Quills scraped against paper as the merchants calculated the cost of their protection and the convoy's price. The traders turned to the cargo masters for the status of the loading operations. They took a report from the quartermaster on the state of their supplies. Finally, the tack masters checked in with the horses and their spares. The convoy was ready to depart. The merchants reached a quick agreement and announced the order to start. Lupak, the cavalry captain, whistled to his organization, and the mounted warriors cantered forward to pull ahead of the string of wagons. Lupak took off his hat and presented a bow to the gathering of senior officers. He leaped into his saddle and followed his forces to scout the road. No one in the expedition looked back at the small coastal town.",

Kincaid endured his suffering with a grimace as he would never tell the hardened mercenaries how much he hurt. The best he could do is keep his feet dry and change his socks. A touch of magic and he’d be light on his feet. Sholeh caught his contemplation and shook her head. How could she know? It didn’t matter; she was right. Adelaise’s company supported Sholeh and Kincaid, but each member ensured the newcomers carried their weight with guard duty and their hired skills. They pulled patrol, cleaned dishes, maintained the company’s gear, and stood watch with everyone else. The couple was frequently on the first watch and rarely pulled breakdown duties. This small gesture from the team gave them time to adjust to life on the road and conserve their strength. That was enough to get Kincaid through another day. The other foot company criticized them at every opportunity. Adelaise’s team usually didn’t bear much scrutiny, but Kincaid and Sholeh bore the brunt of the complaints. In response, Kincaid put his head down and focused on keeping his legs in motion, which was a comfortable pace with the heavy wagons. “Feet still hurt, kid? Your baby sword slowing you down?” The four rival mercenaries gathered around as Kincaid changed his socks at the halt in the journey. “You know your captain was supposed to bring swords to this caravan. When we get into those mountains, you better know how to swing a blade,” another prodded. Kincaid was too tired to take offense. Each step brought him closer to the Empire. Every night, he had a belly full of food. Even with his pack as a pillow, he slept like the dead. Sholeh snuggled close every night near the fire, and he waited until the soft rhythm of her deep sleep settled into his soul. “You listening, kid?” The voices approached. Kincaid didn’t care about them or their words. He scrunched his feet back into his boots and got up, and he didn’t need a confrontation. There were at least twenty wagons out in front of him. The company would be near the front line of the caravan, too far away to help. “How about we see that baby blade of yours?” Rafas led this small group. He was a squad leader with a nasty attitude. Kincaid didn’t need to look behind him as the smells of their dirty clothes and days of exertion preceded them. Another stench, too. Alcohol. By nightfall, they’d be angry and looking for a fight. He’d be on watch. One of the big guards clamped his meaty hand on his shoulder and pushed hard enough to spin Kincaid around. “Our company doesn’t think your captain knows how to hire swords.” “Save the fight for the bandits. Like you said, we’ll need everyone by the time we get to the mountains.” Kincaid turned away from them. He nearly flung backward on his back as the thug grabbed his cloak. “Don’t you ever turn your back on me.” “Let go of my cloak, or you won’t have a hand to hold it.” Kincaid threw the man’s arm to the side. The catcalls began. Kincaid unclasped his cloak and let it fall to the ground. He squared up against the opponent and looked him in the eyes. The weight of the sword at his hip felt out of place. “You better change your mind before you get hurt.” Kincaid snorted. “The four of you against me? Must be great warriors for sure. The finest the Empire has ever seen.” He was too tired for these childish games, like they were apprentices vying for the master’s attention. Kincaid lashed out with his fist and caught the thug in the gut. He followed with a left to the center of the body. The surprise blow was enough to knock the man to his knees. One downward blow across the man’s nose, and he’d be done. The rasp of drawn steel warned Kincaid the fight just got deadly. These people were trained warriors who wouldn’t shed a tear at his bleeding corpse. Kincaid pulled his eyes from the struggling foe and tore his short blade from his sheath and turned toward the next threat. A pair of thugs advanced on him with bared steel. They maneuvered without commands and swung wide to get him to expose one side to an attack. They’d cut him down where he stood. Use it. Show them what you are. Kincaid pushed the voice out of his mind and focused on the advancing men. At least the fourth one was occupied and helping the ringleader up from the ground. Kincaid matched the flow of the advancing blades and put his back against the closest wagon. Steel flashed, and Kincaid met the blow with a ring of steel. Surely the companies would hear this fight. His impact was powerful enough to deflect the danger away from his body and fast enough to recover before the next slash came in from the partner. On his best day, he didn’t have enough experience to beat one prepared warrior. He wasn’t that good with a blade, and they knew it. They came at him again with blades cutting through the air. Magic flooded in Kincaid’s soul and raced through his arms. He tracked each opposing warrior's movement, and Kincaid’s blade moved impossibly fast as he anticipated the path and the arc of each blade. First one deflection and then a twist toward the other. The world moved slow enough to counter the two attacks with enough time to consider his next moves. Kincaid heard the shouts from the front of the caravan and the sounds of running feet with his magic-infused senses. They wouldn’t get to him in time. Finish it. Instead of blocking the next blow, Kincaid surged forward. With the hilt of his short blade, he thrust downwards and snapped the wrist of one thug. Bones cracked, and tendons popped. Reversing the blow with uncanny speed, he punched his blade through the metal armor until the short edge came out of the man’s back. The dying thug coughed up bloody spittle from the unexpected attack. Kincaid released the blade as he’d never have the strength to withdraw it from the falling body. He spun on his feet to meet the surviving assailant. Even without a blade in his hand, he was more deadly than every warrior in this caravan. Yes. Show them. Feel it. “Kincaid, no!” Sholeh. The blade came down in a slow-motion arc. Kincaid pulled his body out of the way and launched a punch into the man’s side. Ribs gave way under chain armor. With a grunt, the man fell to his knees. Kincaid panted with his exertion and looked at his three attackers. Blood pooled around the one with the short sword still poking through his back. One lay on the ground, groaning and holding his side. The ringleader was being helped to his feet by the last one. He took two steps forward and grabbed the troublemaker by the hair, and yanked his head back to close nose to nose. “Next time, I won’t be so gentle with my baby blade, Rafas.” “Kincaid, enough.” The barked words of the command brought him back to reality. Adelaise stood next to Sholeh. Her look of disbelief matched Sholeh’s horror. He kicked the body over and pulled the sword out of the corpse. The man’s cloak became a convenient rag for the weapon. Kincaid scooped up his cloak and fastened it around his neck. “By all that is holy, what have you done?”",

      "title": "Adelaise - Choices",
      "content": "Adelaise - Choices Damn it all. Adelaise flung a rock into the darkness surrounding her company’s campfire. The voices naturally joking with the end of another day were subdued, no one willing to draw her ire. They’d set the watch and stay out of her way. He had to kill one of them. A fight between guards was not uncommon on these longer trips. The boredom got to many of these trained killers, and they’d take it out on the rival companies. In many ways, the captains of the sellswords encouraged this rivalry. Trained warriors needed to practice their skills, and a killer’s instinct would grow dull. Stories from the guild's history were passed down to captains and reminded them companies fought against each other. Friendships between units were rare. But under most scenarios, the mercenary companies ignored one another. They worked their contracts, earned their pay, and sold their services to the next payer. Captains disciplined their forces, and they did so without possibility of appeal—until things went beyond their authority. When the contract owners got involved in discipline and justice, the outcome would rarely be useful. This group of merchants and associated sellsword captains would make Kincaid pay for his indiscretion. Damn him. The merchants weren’t the only ones that were paying Adelaise. She knew Sholeh would grab her pack and head off into the darkness with Kincaid if he walked away. They wouldn’t survive a night in these lands, much less the entire journey to Pilaetium. But he killed one mercenary and wounded two others twice his size. And there was something different about the carpenter. A public flogging was enough to bring discipline back to the ranks. But that was the normal course for minor brawls. Some severe cases led to the exile of the offenders. Captains were responsible for their soldiers' discipline and could also lose a sizable portion of their contract. But dealing with death was on another level. Why did he kill one of them? Damn him. The merchants called for a leadership meeting after they set the first watch. Discipline would be on their minds, and Xenres would hunt for justice. And then he’d use this to his advantage. Revenge was a dangerous motive. And the kid brought it upon himself. As if summoned by her thoughts, the red-haired carpenter approached the brooding captain. He waited at a loose position of attention. Adelaise didn’t want to talk to him now. But she needed to hear his side of the story before she walked to the leadership meeting. Everyone deserved a chance to tell their side before being judged. She’d lived by this principle for as long as she had the opportunity to command. She waved him over. He came to attention and stood in front of her. His eyes never focused on her face, and Adelaise fought to keep her anger down. “What were you thinking, Kincaid?” “There were four of them. Self-defense.” No sense of apology in his voice. That hurts our case. If he testified this way, he’d find himself flogged or exiled from duty. Not that he wasn’t right. “It’s not enough for you to say self-defense. Others could say the same?” “You’re kidding, right?” The young man was no trained soldier, and he dropped his discipline. Those green eyes filled with a smoldering fire locked on hers. “I picked a fight with four veterans accusing me of being a kid. Everyone knows I can’t handle a weapon.” “But you hit one so hard that your short blade cut through two plates of armor. That’s not a lucky blow.” “You gave me a sword designed to do that kind of work. Thrusting blade, right?” “Kincaid, do not mistake me for a fool. I’ve seen warriors twice your size with blades longer than their bodies not deliver that kind of blow. We need a better defense.” “What am I defending? My right to defend myself? The actions I took? My version of the story? Pick one, captain.” He was getting hot. Convinced he was right. “The merchants are summoning the senior officers of the caravan, and I will have to answer for your actions. We will head into the mountains, and we are down at least two swords. And we have a body in our midst.” “I don’t see how this affects me.” “They will decide your punishment.” “Punishment?” The man’s fires subsided with the recognition of reality. “Keep your voice down, Kincaid. We are the last group of people who are on your side right now.” “I thought we hired on a company to protect a caravan and kill, if necessary.” “Not each other.” “They were after me, and I imagine they were after your company. I can make a case I was defending the caravan.” “That’s a stretch. I won’t bring that up tonight. You’re standing first watch with Sholeh. If you take one step outside of our firelight, I will have her hit you with one of those hammers.” Adelaise moved to the front of the procession after her discussion with Kincaid. She didn’t want to be the last one to arrive when the inquiry was about her company. The merchants sat on three portable benches, and several tree trunks served as seats for the rest of the arrivals. Junior members of the caravan tended to the crackling fire. Lupak, the captain of the cavalry company, was already seated. His steed was tied off to a nearby tree. He crossed his riding boots in front of him and ignored Adelaise’s arrival. Instead, he sipped from a wooden mug with steam rising from the brim into the night air. Adelaise nodded toward the merchants and chose one of the trunks nearest the fire. She couldn’t hide, so she might as well be warm. One of the servants came by and offered a mulled wine for her to sip and push back the cold. Adelaise waved him off. Not a good image for tonight. Xenres made his grand entrance into the firelight. He marched with military precision, and the full rattle of his armor and weapons made a commotion before the light revealed his features. His helm concealed his face until he pulled it off, tucked it under his arm, nodded to the merchants, and then chose his seat. He refused to look at his fellow captains. The leader of the traders sighed, leaving a white cloud in front of his face. “We should call this meeting to order. It’s too cold for formalities or reviewing of contracts. Adelaise, what do you have to say for your company.” “Self defense. No more, no less. Four people attacked my member.” “Ridiculous. The mercenary goaded my men into a fight they couldn’t win. He murdered one, crippled another, and wounded a third. This wasn’t self-defense. This caravan needs to execute justice.” Xenres would hold nothing back. “Are you implying a lone man, one we’ve all seen fumble with his sword, planned to be by himself, summon a third of your company, convince them to attack him, and then finish them off? Let’s talk about ridiculous for a moment—” “Enough. Our concern is that we have a situation before we enter the most dangerous part of our journey. Two of the companies are standing off against each other, and we are short at least two people in a contract. We must solve our problem and not point fingers.” The merchants would not let a fight start between the captains. “If I may, master merchant.” Lupak set his mulled wine on the frozen ground. He waited until the merchants gestured for him to continue. “We require the arms we have right now, and we need to ensure discipline. I propose we launch an inquiry into the matter and then hold trial when through the passes.” Armor rattled as Xenres lurched to his feet. “An investigation? What more evidence do we need than a body?” “You’ve had your say, Captain Xenres. Your company is not without fault.” Xenres closed his mouth. “Give us a moment to discuss.” The merchants swung their backs to the fire and began their deliberations. Frosty breath rose over the huddled heads, and the voices carried into the darkness. The worst case for Adelaise would have been a quick decision. As they spun back around, the faces illuminated in the flickering light revealed they were not happy with the decision. That would be enough to slow this discussion down to a level they could figure out what to do. Kincaid was a lucky man. “Captain, your suggestion is the best option we have. You will lead the investigation into this fight between companies. The rest will continue the march and offer protection.” “I object—” “It’s noted, Xenres. You will get your say again when we get through the pass. But, as one company is short, Adelaise, your company will have to pick up the additional duties. You will draw the extra patrol and the extra watch.” Adelaise groaned inside. She should have seen that coming. No way she’d be able to put Kincaid on that side of the caravan, so that meant her experienced warriors would cover down on the mess Kincaid made. Her side would be short, and even the swords she had left weren’t real warriors. “Understood.” “And the trial will happen on the other side of the passes. You will agree to these terms, or we will report both your companies to the guild.” Neither of them could oppose this solution. It was the best of the poor options they had left. And it was the best option left for Kincaid and Sholeh.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Trial",
      "content": "Kincaid - Trial The weather and terrain were formidable adversaries to the slow-moving caravan. Horses struggled under their loads, and people huddled to preserve their body heat. Kincaid regretted they left at least a week too late as the heavy wagons slipped on the ice and snow. The cavalry scouts used their horses to push through the heavy drifts for the wagons to follow. Essential repairs to the wagons kept Kincaid’s hands blistered. Cracked axels and broken wheels were backbreaking work in the narrow passes. He earned his keep every day, and none of his efforts had anything to do with his swordsmanship. He hoped the merchants would go easy on him when the imminent trial took place. On the other hand, Adelaise was hard on him. He pulled extra shifts for watch and took the most dangerous jobs in the company. At the end of every day, darkness rushed to claim his mind. He never remembered dreams, and the voice inside his head was silent as he crashed into a deep sleep. As hard as he worked on the caravan, Kincaid dreaded the thought of making it through the pass. Each step felt heavier as they crested the last hill. The idea of a trial caused his spirit to plummet into the gorges of the mountain passes. He’d been imprisoned in a tiny cell, fought his way to his freedom, struggled for his loved ones, and escaped from the clutches of the powerful Duke of Caesea. Now, he faced justice again. It wasn’t his fault. Lupak had endless energy and conducted his investigation every night as they set the watches. Kincaid’s conversation with the cavalry captain was cordial. Most importantly, the man listened. Kincaid described the setup, the four mercenaries' actions, and the brief fight to save his life. He regretted killing anyone, but the alternative was a different body on the side of the road—his. Confronting his doubts and fears was difficult. Sholeh was the warm presence in his life. She knew what he’d done and what he had to do. Of all the people in the caravan, she also knew what it cost his soul to defend himself from the four mercenaries. They huddled by the fire to share their meals. No one approached Kincaid, even as he earned his keep as a carpenter on the trip. Sholeh ignored the others and always sat next to him. “What are you going to tell the merchants, my friend?” “The same as I told the captain.” He blocked the wind with his cloak and stoked the fire into feeble existence. “I can’t believe I’m on trial because four men attacked me. I wonder if it would be different if I killed them all.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid.” Her voice trailed off into the air and the night. “I know, Sholeh. Everyone knows I can’t use a sword, but I’m under suspicion of murder.” “There is a body.” Kincaid shook his head and looked off into the morning light. The usual noises of the camp were quieter this morning. The members of the caravan waited in anticipation for the trial. “Will you tell them about the magic?” “I can’t.” That admission would change everything. If he explained his powers, then no one would believe self defense. The case against him would be he was looking to settle a score and finish the fight he didn’t start. “I agree. Be strong, Kincaid.” “After all we’ve been through to get here, we are the strongest ever.” Members of the caravan gathered in a copse of trees. The worst of the travel was behind them, and the blowing snow was a memory. Servants set up makeshift benches and seats from cut logs. Hot wine made its way among the trial observers. Even for the most experienced traders, this was the first caravan trial they’d ever witnessed. None had ever needed it. The front row of observer seats was for the captains of the companies. Out here in the wilderness, rank still had its privileges. And the caravan needed discipline. One seat remained empty at the end of the first row. The lead investigator, Lupak, had a significant role this morning, and he’d have no time for sitting and observing. Ironically, Kincaid crafted a new bench for the merchants. With the rudimentary tools from one of the wagons, he spent the evenings working with his hard-earned skills to settle his mind. Those that sat in his judgment kept their padded behinds on the work of his hands. The merchants called the meeting to order and summoned the lead investigator to begin his statements. “Master merchants. You asked me to investigate the events surrounding a death before we entered the mountain passes. I had the chance to examine the body, interview the fighters, and talk to the witnesses. And this is not an easy case.” Kincaid pulled in a sharp breath to speak. Sholeh glanced at him and shook her head. Don’t. “The accused is being charged for murder and bodily injury to two others.” Kincaid breathed an internal sigh of relief. No charges for magic. “There’s no doubt he fought four people and killed one of them. All the accounts line up the same way.” “Then what did you discover, captain.” “I can’t figure out the how or the why.” Voices rose above a murmur. Weapons and armor rattled from the guards positioned around the copse of trees. Kincaid grimaced. There was something more here. “Obviously, there are two different stories as to why the fight happened. One party claims they were goaded into a fight. The other explains they were fighting in self defense. The story of self defense rings true in my heart.” “This isn’t justice—” Xenres roared from his seat. “You will be next, Xenres, if you don’t shut your mouth.” The head merchant stared down the irate mercenary. Guards fingered their weapons. One spark and the camp would ignite. This was the opposite result from what the merchants expected. Lupak waited for the outburst to settle. As the ruckus turned to mumbles, the merchants motioned him to continue. Adelaise leaned forward in her seat. “But how does a man armed with only a short sword cut down a member of the Guild of Blades and wound two others with his hands? I’m left with that question.” He paused and looked back at the silent crowd. The captain landed his gaze on Kincaid. “I found someone who might have an explanation.” Kincaid’s heart pounded his rib cage but controlled the fear from escaping to his face. “One of the teamsters saw the accused fight in a ring in the town. A skilled boxer who took on men larger than himself.” Sholeh’s face dropped, and Kincaid couldn’t bring himself to look at Adelaise. The captain might have missed his calling in life as a barrister. He was good. Maybe too good. “Master merchants, I believe the young man fought in self-defense.” Lupak held his hands up for silence as the camp murmured. “I don’t find it reasonable that a young man would wander to the back of our caravan to find a fight with four people. If he wanted to kill one, he would have done it one-on-one.” Xenres stood up with his fists curled into balls. His chest thrust forward, and his mouth pumped his hot breath into the morning air like a bellows. But he stayed silent and controlled his outburst. Lupak paused long enough to see if there would be another outburst. He went on, “But the young man, Kincaid, was capable enough with his blade and hands to handle his own. That bothers me.” His voice trailed off. “Then you have a recommendation for this gathering?” “Yes, master merchants. I recommend exile for the mercenary, Kincaid.” Voices exploded in the copse of trees, and Xenres sat down on his stump. The grin plastered his face as he glanced between Adelaise and Kincaid. Order came back to the gathering as the merchants considered the recommendation. The group leader turned to Kincaid, “Do you have any words to say as we consider judgment?” Words tumbled through his mind as he pondered what would happen to him and Sholeh. They’d come this far, had limited funds, and were left alone. His fight cost them dearly. If Sholeh would even go with him. Find the words. Kincaid settled his mind even as the forces of magic clamored for recognition. He knew he had the words. He always did. “Master merchants, captains, ladies and gentlemen, I have a few remarks in my defense.” Kincaid paused to gather his thoughts. Adelaise shook her head, but Sholeh was riveted to his every word. “I’ve worked with many of you on this journey. We shared meals and stood watch. We fixed wagons and kept this convoy safe. We waded through the snow, pushing on wagon wheels to keep the convoy moving forward. Always forward. “The days were never easy for me. This life on the road is different from what I trained to do as a journeyman carpenter in Caesea. You helped me grow into this role and learn this life. And as we sit in this copse of trees, there’s an air of victory around us. We made it. Together. “What I’ve never done is threaten anyone in this group. So I ask you to consider my innocence.” “Other than the body and broken bones.” The voice was loud enough to carry across the gathering in the still air. Kincaid ignored the interruption but changed his tone. “Just look at me. Every mercenary in this caravan calls me a kid. I’ll bet there are some echoes of laughter in those mountain passes about me carrying this blade at my hip.” Heads nodded amongst the listeners. Kincaid kept the grin off his face and pushed his advantage. “I regret the moment I ended up alone near the end of the wagons. Each day drained my energy, and I was tired. That’s not an excuse because my captain warned me not to be alone. I was wrong. I hadn’t learned my place. “When confronted, I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have a plan to escape from four armed veterans of many campaigns. And when I had to fight, I had no choice. “Help was too far away, and they threatened my life when they drew blades. Yes, I had to fight. I had to kill. I wish I could take those moments back. I wish I could give that life back.” Kincaid paused and let the silence fall over the clearing in the trees. Each person waited for his next words. “I will put my faith in the wisdom of the master merchants.” As Kincaid sat down, all eyes turned toward the master merchants. None would envy the task now in front of them. Whispers grew as the merchants deliberated Kincaid’s fate. When they turned back to the group, none made eye contact with Kincaid. “We are very concerned with this case. In our years of working this route, none of us has encountered this breach in discipline.” The master merchant held up his hand to head off words of indignation. “This investigation revealed failures to comply with contracts from two companies. We have a body and injuries. Most concerning is the failure of leadership.” The captains dropped their heads with the leveled accusations. The Sword Guild would not be pleased with the charges brought against them, and it threatened the contracts themselves. All realized the merchants were right. “But for the sake of discipline, we must also consider the case at stake. We have mercenaries fighting amongst themselves. Self-defense or not, this is unacceptable behavior brought before this body. We will take action.” Kincaid caught himself holding his breath. He wanted to look at Sholeh and Adelaise, but he couldn’t remove his eyes off the gathering of master merchants. “Kincaid, you are exiled from this caravan. We thought about harsher punishments, but we accept that one man does not fight against four warriors. But you must also pay for your crimes. Just as importantly, the captains must understand their contracts are under review.” Sholeh jumped to her feet and drew a breath to protest, but the lead merchant silenced her by holding up his hand. He shook his head. Kincaid caught Adelaise’s glance toward the outraged Sholeh. Kincaid accepted his fate. “You are hereby thrown from this caravan. You sacrifice all rights to profits and pay. And you have until morning to pack your belongings and find your path to wherever fate may lead you.” Kincaid nodded his acknowledgment. “If we find you in the caravan after the sun clears the horizon, we will treat you as a brigand.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Fools",
      "content": "Sholeh - Fools “You can’t come with me.” “By all that is holy, you will not last an hour.” “You don’t have to go to the Empire, Sholeh.” Kincaid was such a fool. She swore four years ago she would never return, and now she stood on the border. “It’s always been about your magic, Kincaid.” He wisely considered his words, as his earlier efforts didn’t blunt her determination. “I could follow behind the caravan or range out in front of the wagons. We could still meet there.” “By all that is right and holy, Kincaid, I will not discuss this with you again. You do not have a choice in who is coming with you, and you are not heading out into the realms alone. Do I make myself clear?” He was the piece of iron between her hammer and anvil. She’d beat him into submission. He really wouldn’t last an hour in this part of the world without her. She stuffed her extra clothing and belongings into her pack. The two hammers lay on the ground with her personal items. Sholeh fingered the length of heavy leather cord at the base of each hammer. She left them and closed the flap to her bag. “You can take those.” The command was quiet but firm. “I cannot. They were part of our contract with you, and we did not live up to our terms.” Adelaise stepped into view. Her stance was relaxed, and her face expressed concern. “That’s not true, Sholeh. You are in good graces with our company, and the merchants appreciate your work as a smith. You could stay.” “You know I cannot.” “I thought I would try to change your mind, but you already made your plans. Anything I can say to keep you around the caravan? I can use your help.” After the merchants announced the verdict, many people from all parts of the caravan got up to shake Kincaid’s hand. They were disappointed with the judgment for exile, even if they understood the logic. But not Adelaise. After the exile announcement, she got up and walked away from the copse of trees and disappeared along the length of the wagon train. Sholeh considered following for a moment to apologize, but Kincaid needed her more at that moment. Sholeh shot a glance toward her friend. Guards from the company wished him farewell and words of wisdom. He’d be fine while Sholeh discovered the captain’s intent. “Kincaid and I started this journey together. When we left Caesea, we made plans to get to Pilaetium. We must finish them.” “But I can bring you to Pilaetium.” “Not together.” Adelaise looked them both over. She looked like she was calculating her odds of changing their determination. Not likely. “The master merchants asked me to give this to you, Kincaid.” She reached under her cloak and pulled out a small sack. The leather bag with a thick drawstring jingled in her hands as Kincaid turned away from the company's last members. Brushing the dirt off his pants, he reached for the bag. “What’s this?” “Accumulated pay—” “After what I’ve done? I thought the sentence—” “Kincaid, the merchants agreed with almost everything you said. The circumstances are suspicious, and the investigation revealed you were likely innocent.” “Then why are we having this discussion and saying our farewells?” “Because the merchants can’t have a war going on between our companies as we finish the last dangerous stretch of our journey. Something had to be done to keep the other infantry company in line.” “By all that is holy, the caravan is down three swords, and now they will lose two more.” “They weren’t counting on your leaving, Sholeh. So I added your salary to the bag. They’ll pay me back.” “No, we cannot accept this.” Kincaid moved forward to stand by Sholeh’s side. Adelaise shook her head and dropped her hand, still holding the small bag of wealth. “I’ve watched the two of you around our camp for the entire journey. I know if one of you leaves, the other will follow. No doubt in my mind. You need something to get your journey started, and if you are smart, you’ll have enough here to make it to the capital.” Sholeh was shocked as Kincaid reached for the bag. He shrugged his shoulders and tucked the money away. “Then we need to say thank you. And, I have to apologize for letting you down.” “Not required. I hired you on, and I’m responsible for the actions of my company. I’ve known that for a long time. I usually get more wins than losses.” She gave them both a half grin. Sholeh wondered why the mercenary captain was remarkably calm, given the threat to her career and reputation. “We will be gone before morning light, Adelaise. I hope we see you in Pilaetium.” Kincaid turned away from their former captain. “Oh, you will. I’m coming with you.” “But the company and the contract?” Kincaid fumbled with the bag at his belt and nearly spilled the wealth to the ground. Sholeh couldn’t believe her ears. “All in good stead. As you pointed out, the caravan is already short swords. So I decided to roll up the remainder of my company under Lupak and gave him the rest of the contract's rights. I can’t afford another enemy right now.” Adelaise looked them both over. “It happens.” “But not for us.” The sound in Kincaid’s voice showed the edge he felt. He didn’t want to owe anyone. “It happens in the guild fairly regularly. Normally, the roll-up of a contract happens on the battlefield when a company takes losses.” She adjusted her cloak without taking her eyes off her charges. “I will face the consequences one way or another when we get to Pilaetium. No way around that. I might as well do it with the shred of honor I have left. It will likely play out better for me. You know, leadership and all.” “I don’t know, Adelaise. You said the merchants agreed with most of the investigation.” “They did. But there is something different about you. That makes my case far more interesting. We leave before the first light.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Return",
      "content": "Sholeh - Return No longer burdened by the wagons' creeping pace and excessive setup and teardown times, the three travelers pushed across the sweeping terrain. A small group of travelers, even armed ones, could be a potential target for thieves. But Adelaise had worked these roads before and kept them clear of the potential ambush spots. The region changed from steep hills and thick forests to rolling steppes. The thigh-high grass was dry and brown, and the wind whispered fanciful stories through the stiff stalks. Rather than leave a deep trail of their passing through the grasslands, the trio kept to the trader’s road. The signs of a mighty empire’s wealth appeared around them. Rutted paths with muddy holes eager to damage wheels changed to roads paved with stones wide enough for two wagons to pass each other. Markers indicating directions toward towns stood at each crossroads, and mile markers counted the distance to the capital. Travel became easier as each day’s march found an inn and often a small farming community. Efficient movement across the empire was important for trade, military forces, and control of the dispersed lands. Caesea did not invest in this infrastructure. Kincaid stopped at a bridge over a dry riverbed. He slid down the bank to marvel at the stone arches and weight-bearing engineering. Sholeh couldn’t keep the smile off her face as the young man’s energy seemed endless as he considered the power of the Empire. Adelaise waited. No one in the inns questioned three mercenaries traveling toward the capital. Trade was slow in the winter months, and the innkeepers hungered for news of the realms. In exchange, the owners provided stories on the state of affairs at the edge of an Empire. Conversations turned to the increasing taxes on trade, and war plans meant more bodies into the army. People distant from the capital wanted to be left to their own lives. Sholeh struggled to keep her feet moving closer to Pilaetium. Weeks of travel hardened her body against the daily effort, and they had enough food and rest to continue this pace until spring, if required. But the mental barrier became higher with each footstep. This wasn’t the homecoming she preferred, and she would have been fine living out her life in the west. She wanted a life of simplicity, hard work, and rewards based on merit, not birth. Every step closer brought her farther away from that goal. And she didn’t know how to tell Kincaid why she felt this way. But she’d have to face the inevitable truth soon. Adelaise sensed the discomfort and reluctance, but she stayed silent and didn’t push the issue. Kincaid noticed her quiet days and provided comfort and strength without questioning her motives. She appreciated that he wasn’t trying to pick up her spirits, and his obvious concern helped her heavy soul. They were a strange group. A blacksmith unwilling to come back to a life she once held within the capital. A mercenary reluctant to return to face her judgment. And a wizard hoping to find answers in the uncertainty of his soul. None made for pleasant conversation. As they started the climb toward the last foothills near Pilaetium, Kincaid had the boundless energy that defined his approach to every challenge. Adelaise looked every inch the warrior, ready to face whatever appeared on the other side of the ridge. Sholeh trailed at the end of the trio. Kincaid gasped as they reached the overlook. Pilaetium was the grandest city in the world. Hills rose above a beautiful natural bay, and the city landscape thrust into the water brimming with busy docks. Towers soared toward the heavens, golden roofs reflected the fires of the afternoon sun, and buildings were pristine and white. Wide streets packed with white stones bracketed palaces, churches, and official structures. The city of Caesea, the pride of merchants and wealth in the west, was a hodgepodge collection of structures gathered on a cluster of islands in a bay. The merchant city of Caesea was an unplanned upstart of wealth haphazardly flung across the water compared to the sight below them. Pilaetium commanded respect and demanded attention. The inner wall of the capital city towered over thirty feet into the air. Square towers rose in regular intervals to watch the surrounding terrain, the bay, and the center itself. The bureaucracy of the empire thrived in this inner city, and the wealth gleamed from every building. Just outside the inner wall, structures crammed close to the center of power in the next ring. Buildings in this district were substantial and made by masters of their crafts. Stone, wood, gems, and precious metals gleamed even from this distance. Another thirty-foot wall surrounded this city ring and divided this section from the rest of the outer city. The final, outer section of the city was newer and had the look of upstart wealth struggling to compete with the old money and power arrayed above it. There were pockets of darkness and squalor in the streets, but the roads were wide and led to massive gates awaiting supplicants to the seat of power. The outer wall to the grandest city of the Empire of a Thousand Spears wasn’t finished. The city was growing too fast to allow the next wall to define the city's next ring. The design started from the waterside and worked its way inland. Sholeh could make out the dust rising from work sites cutting stone and raising the outer wall even from a distance. Sholeh hadn’t seen the construction of this new wall before she left Pilaetium years ago, and she wondered if the builders knew the course it would take around the city. Hopeful merchants and homeowners must be scrambling to buy land and build structures before the wall approached the next district. Prices likely climbed by the day. Someone would be profiting. Sholeh approached Kincaid’s side and slid her hand into his. He squeezed her palm without glancing toward her. He couldn’t tear his gaze from the capital. “I had no idea, Sholeh.” “Caesea was impressive, my friend. This is an Empire.” Kincaid gave a low chuckle. He pivoted to take in the traffic through the waterway. The bay was open, and he’d heard of the strategic position the port held for as long as history could remember. The wide bay was perfect for ships waiting at anchor to deliver their cargo. But each end of the waterway was a narrow passage through high cliffs. Military fortifications protected the courses. A naval power couldn't force the straights from either direction. The capital of the Empire straddled the strategic waterway of the world. And profited from the geography. Kincaid looked up at the afternoon sun. “Think we can make it to the wall before sunset?” “Only if the two of you stop gawking at the sights.” Adelaise moved in front of them and strode on the paved road leading toward the city's southern gates. A blockhouse, large enough for perhaps twenty people, stood beside the road. Sholeh caught the glint of steel reflected from the afternoon sun from the rooftop. The windows were slits, and the door was iron-bound wood. The customs house served as guard posts for the Empire’s forces and a money-collection point before traffic backed up at the wall. With the proper paperwork in hand, they’d breeze through scrutiny in the shadow of the walls. The trio watched two individuals leave the front door and mount horses. They were dressed in mail shirts, carried long spears in their hands, and were alert to the travelers carrying weapons. They kicked their steeds into a canter. More people took to the roof. Adelaise stopped and waited for their arrival. Sholeh tugged on Kincaid’s hand. They let the captain stay at the front of the party. “Hail, travelers. Mercenaries here in winter are never good news. Where were you for the spring campaigns?” “Not sitting in a guardhouse in the capital.” The guard with a thick, blond beard flowing from under the chinstrap glared from his warhorse. He chuckled at the unyielding stance of the mercenary captain. “If you cause problems in the city, the watch will take your head. Stay low until spring.” “Not planning to be here that long.” Adelaise made no move forward. Sholeh watched the interactions with curiosity. This was an official outpost of the city guard, and the soldiers were likely veterans of the empire’s campaigns to the east. “Have to pay for the weapons.” Kincaid stepped forward, and before he could draw breath to speak, Adelaise had her hand clamped on his shoulder. “Of course, we will pay if you have the documentation.” The other riders laughed. “The archers will take you down before you draw your sword, mercenary. We can take what we want.” Adelaise let go of Kincaid’s shoulder and dropped her hands to waist level. “True, but you’ll pay dearly for that opportunity.” “Good answer. Standard rate for the blade. No bows? Firearms?” “None.” “We’ll give you the paperwork with the seals in the blockhouse.” The riders turned away and galloped back to their outpost. As the guards from the Empire thundered away, Adelaise spun on the pair and glared at Sholeh. “You must teach this one quickly. This is the Empire. It has more rules than he understands.” Kincaid shrugged out of Sholeh’s grasp. “I know—\" “You don’t. Your instincts are good. But they are misplaced here, and they will get us killed because your methods are terrible. Let’s get our paperwork and finish this trip.” Kincaid’s shoulders slumped with the retort. Sholeh knew Adelaise was right, and Kincaid needed to listen. That was never one of his strengths. Kincaid followed the captain to the blockhouse without saying another word. After securing the documentation, Adelaise led them toward the city's outer ring and away from the growing wall. They couldn’t afford the prices closer to the walls, and the only other outlet was the docks. For now, they stayed farther inland. Adelaise picked an inn, and Sholeh was confident the destination was not random. As the captain went inside to negotiate their fees, Sholeh breathed in the smells. The stench of humanity and livestock fought against the efforts to keep the city bright and alive. Inadequate sewers kept waste in the streets even as innkeepers burned incense and herbs. Homeowners maintained plant boxes on windowsills to provide color. The underside of the city revealed more about the rotten core of the Empire’s bureaucracy. “Sholeh, where are you from?” “Right here, my friend.” “I mean, where in the Empire?” Sholeh let her amusement light her cheeks. “Pilaetium.” “This is so different.” “We must be careful because all is not what it seems.”",

      "title": "Adelaise - Deals",
      "content": "Adelaise - Deals The beer couldn’t wash away the distaste in Adelaise’s mouth. The local swill barely qualified as a beer, but it was safer than drinking anything else in this place. She choked down another swallow of the warm froth. As she looked around the dive called a bar, Adelaise reflected on how far she’d fallen. Her upbringing was distant from the embrace of the mercenary lifestyle in the Empire. She used her sword to carve a reputation and rise through the ranks of the guild. Leadership came with experience and training, and she was good with people. Adelaise managed money with finesse and could keep a company in the field. Now she was on the edge of losing it all. For what? For the woman, Sholeh. Someone important wanted her back in Pilaetium and hired a battalion of spies to track the wayward blacksmith. But the woman was not to return in chains. This was not the regular employment for a sellsword. Another distasteful swallow. She hated this job. Adelaise worked tougher contracts that left friends buried on the field of battle. This was different. She’d have to close out this contract with the spies. Without knowing who these people in the shadows were working for, Adelaise would hand over this smith's location. She liked Sholeh. They weren’t that far apart in age. Maybe six years. Both took on the world with steel in their fist and an edge in their hearts. Adelaise hated not being able to get around the contract. And it was coming due. She suspected the spies knew they arrived in the Outer City. The carpenter changed everything. For weeks, Adelaise saw the pair as a couple. They had the right attraction, and they were alone in their quest against the world. But Adelaise couldn’t see what Sholeh saw in Kincaid. He could be so naïve and optimistic in the darkest parts of a journey. He talked too much when he should be listening. The carpenter was terrible with a sword but amazing with his hands when they touched wood. Despite her initial mistrust, he earned the captain’s respect on the road. When he confronted a problem, Kincaid never backed down. What he lacked in skills, he made up in determination and raw intellect. His courage had no limits, and his integrity was beyond reproach. Most people came to admire him, despite his flaws. Sholeh definitely had a history with him, and her devotion was stronger than the steel she forged. Adelaise struggled with what she had to do next. The betrayal of their trust wasn’t a straightforward task, but she resolved to get it done. She needed to get back in the good graces of the guild. Adelaise took another pull on the terrible beer. Courage might have settled with the floaters at the bottom of the mug. “Deep thoughts, captain.” Heavy boots made their way across the packed earth floor of the bar. Soldier’s boots marching in rhythm still made their impact. Adelaise looked up from her beverage and watched the pair of guild members approach. A man and a woman with the ramrod spines of soldiers halted in front of the table. Both carried blades. At least they weren’t wearing armor. They stood for a moment at attention, but Adelaise ignored them and stared back in her beer. The man cleared his throat and waited for Adelaise's recognition. When none came, he continued, “The Committee knows, captain.” “I figured I would have a few more days before the caravan got here.” “Not when the famous Adelaise the Red shows up at an Empire blockhouse without her caravan,” the woman said. She was young, aggressive, and hungry for recognition. Not unlike Adelaise when she joined the guild. “You should have finished your contract. The committee will launch an inquiry, captain.” The man was older and wiser. He had the scars of battle and knew where his place was in the guild's hierarchy. “I expected as much. But the situation on the caravan changed. Discipline problems.” “That’s a leadership issue.” The woman’s disgust dripped into her tone. If she wanted a fight to test her steel, she might find it tonight. “At least that’s what I’ve heard.” Adelaise moved to her feet fast enough to make both take a half step back. The woman was foolish enough to place her hand on the pommel of her sword. If she moved another inch, Adelaise would show them both why she earned her place as a captain among these cutthroat mercenaries. The inn grew silent with the standoff. “Captain, we are here to summon you to answer for your actions. The leadership question will come up, and the people you accompanied to the city will also be investigated.” The man kept his hands clear of his weapons, and his tone was formal even as his words tumbled over themselves. Adelaise wouldn’t take her eyes off the woman until she stood down. The man was just doing the job in the most professional manner possible. The woman was looking for a way to earn a reputation. Adelaise didn’t want to answer for a body, and the watch wouldn’t be pleased with a mercenary fight. A brawl with another guild member was the last thing Adelaise needed tonight. The younger woman stood down first. Her hands dropped back to her sides, and she took another step back. The sounds of the inn picked up. Adelaise turned to the man and asked, “Do you have the summons?” “I do, captain.” With deliberate gestures, he reached into the pocket of his cloak. He handed over a sealed letter. Crossed swords in the red wax and precise script across the paper. This would be bad. “Your message has been delivered.” Adelaise made a show of placing the message within her cloak. The man came to attention again and turned back toward the door. The scowl never left the woman’s face. As the door slammed behind them, Adelaise stepped to the bar and gave orders to feed her companions and inform them she would be late. Receiving confirmation and paying in advance, Adelaise headed for the door. The summons sped up her timeline. The afternoon was busy with workers finishing the day’s effort on recent construction. Life of the capital had an insatiable demand for laborers to increase the glory of the Empire. Power struggles were part of the daily menu in the Inner City. Merchants, priests, bureaucrats, and imperial families vied for upper reaches of power. Spies and soldiers found their places as tools of influence. These thoughts danced across Adelaise’s consciousness as she considered her role as a pawn in this city's games. A captain could drive respect just about anywhere but Pilaetium. The entire guild was a tiny piece on the board game of power. Their current guild master opposed meddling in the politics of countries. Bad for business. If nations followed their natural course toward conflict, the guild would always have plenty of work. If only Adelaise were on her guild’s business, her heart might settle to its normal rhythm. And she’d have a chance at the inquiry. Instead, she made her way through the Middle City walls. Guards were lazy at this gate late in the day and didn’t note traffic flow as the skies changed from deep blue to evening red. Ordinary people didn’t pose a threat, and before the sun made its last plunge to the horizon, they’d shut the gates for the night. The watch would ensure peace within the walls. The scale of the houses matched the increased prosperity of this district. Not as old as the Inner City, this area still had pockets of inherited wealth combined with young money generated from the Empire’s continuing growth and success. The streets were wide and clean, and crafted stone aqueducts carried water to local fountains and pools. The sewers were effective, and they thrust the smells back into the Outer City. Amongst wealth and dwellings were the upper-end shops of masters and finer places to live, drink, and dine. Adelaise was comfortable in this part of the town. She’d grown up around wealth and wasn’t intimidated by the trappings of power like most of the lower born. That may have been part of the reason they picked her for this other contract. The Golden Wagon Inn was a good choice for travelers waiting to enter the Inner City. They were less than a hundred meters from the walls protecting the apex of power within the Empire, and this inn had a doorman at the entrance. “Good evening, Captain.” Adelaise hadn’t bothered to take off her rank at her right shoulder. No matter. Until the inquiry was complete, she’d still be a captain. “Evening. Here for a meeting.” “Of course. And welcome.” The man reached forward and pulled open the door for Adelaise. The inside was inviting. A wood stove pumped its heat into the waiting area, a small room lit by oil lamps. Paintings from around the world hung on the three walls and invited gawkers to examine the works of art. A woman waited as the exterior door closed. Without waiting for a name or introduction, the woman used her gloved hand to open the inner door and gestured for Adelaise to follow. The plush carpet under Adelaise’s boots absorbed the sound of the passage. Tapestries and curtains lined the corridor leading between private eating and meeting areas within this inn. Amongst the wealth in this room, Adelaise’s sword and dagger felt out of place. She couldn’t fight with steel what lurked in these rooms. The woman bowed and pulled back a curtain to an indeterminate room. Adelaise ducked through the opening and stepped inside. The table was beautiful craftsmanship of rare wood, but her focus was on the man on the other side of the table. Spies always sat in the shadows. The intelligence agencies must look for people that long to fill their lives with drama and intrigue. They wasted it in this place. The exquisite decor was far beyond the standard cloak and daggers. These spies were not to be trifled with. The man sitting in the shadows was cutting a fine section of meat on china. He selected each piece with a precise stab of his fork and brought the morsel to his lips. He gestured with his knife for Adelaise to sit. “Your arrival was uneventful.” The man rolled his “r”s like a growl. He stabbed another slice of meat and crammed it into his mouth. Adelaise wasn’t sure if he was asking a question or making a statement. Black eyes peered out from under bushy black eyebrows. “Ahead of schedule, but I wouldn’t call it uneventful.” “Sit, sit.” The fingers jabbed the fork into another bite. As his mouth chewed, his fingers worked the knife to hack off another piece. “You finished your task?” “Yes, she’s here in town.” The man paused the sacrifice of his slab of meat and grabbed the crystal glass of fine red wine. The Golden Wagon didn't serve substandard vintages. He swirled the liquid as it splashed across his tongue. He placed the goblet on the table and leaned forward into the light. His suntan features made his skin look leathery. “Does she know?” “Nothing. I hired her on with the caravan and brought her here.” “My employers will not appreciate deceit.” He trailed off with another growl. “She came with a young man, a carpenter. He was trying to get to Pilaetium.” “Why is he important?” Another piece of meat suffered the same fate as the others. “You paid me to bring the girl here. Are you paying extra for the boy or the info?” The knife and fork rattled on the table. “We still hold what you value, Adelaise.” He spoke her name like a deadly poison. “You’d be wise to remember that.” “Then conclude this contract. I’ve completed my part.” “I will be the judge of that. I will see the woman alive and in town before I release anything to you.” Adelaise imagined the fountain of blood if she thrust the knife on the table into the front of his throat. He wouldn’t be able to scream, and the horrific meal would be over. But she’d be no closer to her goals than before she took the caravan contract. “If we are done…” Adelaise got up from the table. “Oh, Adelaise, good luck with your inquisition. I think we’ll be doing business again.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Hammering the Past",
      "content": "Sholeh - Hammering the Past “I need to run out.” Sholeh smiled as Kincaid tried to open a groggy eye. Their room had two beds, and Kincaid slept like the dead. From prisons to wooden floors to sleeping in the open, Kincaid hadn’t slept an enjoyable night sleep since his time in the carpentry shop with Master Barnet. She hated leaving him here alone. “Why?” His voice croaked, and he tried to blink away the fog in his vision. “I am concerned we did not eat with Adelaise last night.” “She paid for the meal and left a message with the staff.” He stretched and pulled his legs to the side of the bed. Kincaid had always been small, but now he was wiry with too many bones sticking through his skin. The burden of magic with not enough food was taking its toll on her young friend. “We’ll see her around.” “I am concerned that we are back in Pilaetium, and she left us last night.” “You worry too much. She could have abandoned us at the caravan or left us somewhere in the city.” “You do not know this city, Kincaid.” “How much do you know?” Sholeh turned away from him and looked toward the door. She didn’t want him to see her face. “Too much.” The bed crunched as Kincaid’s weight lifted. His barefoot feet padded across the cold floor, and his arms wrapped around her. “You are different here, Sholeh.” Sholeh didn’t turn toward him even as his warmth melted her resolve. “I will be back soon. I have to make a visit.” His feet didn’t move as she pulled away and reached for the door. She didn’t look back as the door clicked shut. This would be hard enough as it was. Sholeh moved onto the Outer City’s roads and looked up at the shadows cast by the Middle City walls. Smooth stone loomed over the streets and nearby houses. The roads were more established, and the wealth in this district rose with the proximity to the walls. These established shops were the signs of rising young wealth that tended to the Outer City's needs. These buildings had thick stone walls, bright storefronts, and maintained roads. She breathed in the smells of the capital. The population in the Outer City lived day-to-day and performed the labor of the city. The houses were compact and often stacked on top of each other. Taxes in the capital could be brutal, and families often shared the burden. At least the chilly air of the approaching winter kept the smells of the open sewer manageable this morning. The streets were uneven, built too fast, and constructed with substandard material. As the capital grew, the Empire wouldn’t tolerate the inefficient road system in town. The people here counted on the government to make this section of the city right. Guards wearing padded armor with white and red checkered dye watched the morning traffic. Leadership of the Empire and the rulers of Pilaetium didn’t want the skilled warriors of the capital to fall under a single power structure, so the City Guard was distinct from the City Watch. Competing chains of command and different responsibilities kept the city safe from itself. Sholeh knew there was a place for mercenaries within the capital and across the Empire for this exact reason. Loyalty could be bought and disbanded when no longer needed. Travelers to the Middle City faced scrutiny from the city guards. They made token efforts to find contraband and checked paperwork. Sholeh didn’t worry these guards would recognize her. She kept her cloak wrapped around her body to conceal her hammers. Even with documentation in a pocket, she’d rather not end up with the mercenary label. The guards waved her through the broad opening. The oak doors stood on massive hinges. She glanced upwards at the steel gate raised and secured, ready to crash down with the pull of a lever. Trapped forces between these grates would be shredded by archers and melted by oil. The Middle City was a stark contrast to the Outer City Sholeh left behind. The city streets of the Middle City were wide enough for two wagons to pass one another, and the cobblestone paths were straight and well-maintained. Cities and citadels in the west preferred angled roads and curves to be part of the town's defensive capabilities, but the Empire was above that. The walls stood for hundreds of years and fended off attackers by sea and land. Sholeh didn’t need to follow the street signs at each intersection. She remembered where the blacksmith guild headquarters was. Smiths and metalworkers advertised their location with the crash of steel on steel. Smoke cast pillars of darkness against the clear skies. Brimstone stung Sholeh’s eyes as ash clung to her shirt. Many years ago, her life away from the Inner City began here. Merchants ignored Sholeh as she paced the streets. She didn’t carry the signs of wealth and wasn’t worth their time to hawk wares she couldn’t afford. At the end of the track was a four-story building constructed from stone. The structure looked like a fortification on the street corner and may have been a military headquarters when the city was younger. Now, it served as a guildhall for the smiths. Sholeh paused, looked up at the sign of hammer and anvil, and took in a deep breath before walking inside. The door swung on silent hinges, a mark of the craftsmanship the guild represented. The interior hadn’t changed in the years she’d been gone. A single clerk staffed the expansive wooden desk with metal trim. He didn't lift his head from the mountain of paperwork and ledgers stacked in piles across his desk. Padded rugs from the far east covered the floor and muffled her footsteps. Light streamed in through the windows protected with thick glass. “May I help you?” “Yes, I wish to pay my respects.” “Looking for membership then?” “No, I have been a member. I have returned from travel abroad.” The man was a local and displayed the gaudy colors of the city. As a junior representative of the guild, he couldn’t afford the more delicate silks and materials the masters wore to signify their place, but he wore the woolen material suited for his position in administration. “I see. Then we should have you meet with the membership committee.” “No, I do not think so. I should greet Master Phaseal.” “That won’t be possible. He does not have walk-in hours for people to come in off the street.” “He will want to meet me. Please tell him that Sholeh is here.” “I don’t care who you are. I will see you never work in this city as a smith.” Sholeh considered her position and then examined her next action. “May I have a seat then? You should check with your superior.” Without waiting for an answer, Sholeh sat on the cushioned couch next to the administrator’s desk. Typical of a bureaucrat, he decided that it was better to seek approval than make an independent decision. Some things wouldn’t change in the Empire. The man closed his paperwork and slipped from behind his desk toward the curtain to his side. He gestured for a guard to take his place at the table. The guild had not changed. Money taxed from the sweat-stained worker filled the guild's coffers, and the wealth paid for hired swords to protect the sprawling bureaucracy and the top levels of the guild. Guards to restrain guild members were unnecessary in Caesea. As she waited, Sholeh considered her first visit to this building. Leaving the Inner City was hard, but the thought of making something of her life inspired her to create with her hands. This area once seemed intimidating to an applicant, and now she dreaded it for different reasons. The administrator pulled back the curtain and returned to the room. He looked Sholeh up and down with his eyebrows scrunched together. “The master will see you.” It must have hurt him to say that. “Thank you for bringing this to him.” “Oh, I don’t think you’ll be thanking me.” The man’s grin confirmed her fears. The guard stayed in place to watch the door, and the administrator escorted her up the back stairs. The master worked on the fourth floor and had an entire staff to support his efforts. Sholeh whisked through the waiting room and then through an inner office with three clerks working on calculations and papers. The master looked up from his desk. “Sholeh. I expected a cold day in hell before you would walk in that door.” “Coming back through this door is walking into hell.” “Why are you back?” “I wish to work at the anvil again.” “No. You scorned me once. Turned away from us.” His voice never rose above a conversational tone. “I was young, Master Phaseal. You offered too much.” “You were scared.” “Yes. And I left before my father unleashed his wrath upon this guild.” “Then you came here to risk us again?” He placed his hands upon the broad desk and leaned forward in his seat. “My father does not know I am back.” “That will take a day or less. And then the guild will be at risk.” “I came back—” “No, Sholeh. I don’t want to hear this. I don’t.” Sholeh looked down at her travel-weary boots. She listened to the strained breath from the guild’s master. He fought to keep his composure, and Sholeh wouldn’t add fuel to the fire. “You should leave. And we better not catch you working a forge in the Outer City.” “I understand.” Sholeh turned away from the master and walked toward the office. The administrator from the entrance appeared at her side and touched her elbow to guide her away from the inner chamber of power. He heard everything. “You took a risk coming back here.” The official from the front desk voice was quiet. Sholeh glanced at his face to see if it held pity or respect. His face was set and didn’t reveal his intentions. “Yes. I expected what I got, but I wonder if it was worth it.” “The price for working without guild endorsement—” “I know. I must find a different way.” “Your father?” “By all that is holy, don’t.” Sholeh stepped in front of him and took the stairs down two steps at a time. She didn’t wait for the guard to move aside as she pushed past him. The street was a welcome escape from the guild. But the sounds of the forge grated against her hearing now. The welcoming sounds of home were foreign and unexpected. Life would now be more complicated in the city. And Sholeh didn’t have any other ideas.",

      "content": "Kincaid - School of Magic Kincaid paced their compact room. Two beds were a welcome change from sleeping on the floor of an inn or the road's rocks. He worried the women who knew the city had left him alone. Instead of wallowing in his loneliness, Kincaid slipped on his best set of traveling clothes. He glanced at the blade resting against the wall. Sholeh took her hammers when she left, but Kincaid wouldn’t kid himself the sword would be helpful. He slid the weapon under his bed and cinched his belt. The stairs to the common room were sturdy. This low-end inn was better than any they’d seen on the other side of the mountains, but the price was steep enough to exhaust their meager reserve by the end of the week. Kincaid was done waiting for someone to help him on his quest. Time to find the hecaerae, but on his own terms. His determination faltered as he wandered toward the gates blocking the entrance to the Middle City. Kincaid had no idea where to start his search. The hecaerae had the aura of wealth and power about them, and they’d stand out. He’d begin his search in the Middle City. The guards waved him through the Middle City gates with little more than a glance in his direction. No doubt they thought he was another worker making his way to his day labor. On the other side, the expanse of humanity in this part of town seemed grander than the elaborate facades and blatant display of craftwork in Caesea. He couldn’t stop gawking and the broad roads and stone structures beckoning for business. “How does a red-haired immigrant find himself with a banished blacksmith and an outlaw mercenary?” Kincaid spun toward the voice behind him, and his blood pounded with power. “Don’t.” The voice was low. “The city tolerates magic because we do not use it on the streets. If we fight here and destroy a neighborhood, the Empire won’t be as lenient toward the schools of magic.” Kincaid sized up the man. Older than Kincaid, even with the curse of magic. He had dark features with tanned skin, black hair that refused to bear the hints of gray, and deep brown eyes. All the signs of a native of the Empire. His clothes stood out from the passersby on the streets as a wizard from Theurgia. “How did you know I would be here?” “The blacksmith already made her way to the guild house, and the mercenary will face her trial soon. A red-haired immigrant is not difficult to find.” The man’s smile was disarming. Kincaid pushed his senses to detect power in the man’s soul. Nothing. “We hoped you would come.” Kincaid tightened the flow of magic until it left his veins. The wizard nodded his appreciation. “I’m Kincaid, journeyman carpenter.” The man raised an eyebrow in surprise. He raised a hand to his chin and stroked the oiled goatee. “I was expecting a Magi. You summoned magic quickly enough when I surprised you.” Kincaid’s eyes darted to each passerby. “Do we have to have this conversation in the street?” The wizard’s face lit with humor. “Are you worried about the people of the Middle City eavesdropping on hecaerae?” Kincaid fumbled with the logic. “Where I am from, the use of magic is punishable by death.” “Where you are, we don’t use magic in the open. But the Empire accepts us as a powerful organization, as long as we are compliant. I am called Deniz.” Kincaid liked the genuine nature of the older man. His words were rich with a baritone voice, and his face didn’t hold the guile of a politician or noble. But his clothes were worth as much as a year’s pay as a journeyman. Kincaid went with his gut; he had to trust someone. “Deniz, why would your masters be waiting for me?” “Because we wanted to reach you before the Damithians did.” The statement was so matter-of-fact that Kincaid waited for him to continue. When he didn’t, Kincaid cocked his head. “And why would that be bad if the Damithians talked to me first?” “Then, the School of Theurgia wouldn’t be able to understand the power of a western magi. The professors are very interested in your capability. The reports of the destruction in Caesea reached here weeks ago.” Kincaid glanced around him to see if anyone was paying attention to their open conversation. Definitely not the topic he wanted to be discussed in the streets. They could serve you here. Once they see your power, your influence will have no bounds. The voice rang in Kincaid’s head. He fought down his pounding heartbeat and tried not to let the pain show on his face. The wizard made no notice of his discomfort. “I’m here to understand the magic of the Empire.” “That’s a fascinating statement. Why would you think it’s different from anywhere else, Kincaid?” “Because you have schools.” “That just means training and the wisdom of those who have gone before you. But like the sun rising in the east, it’s the same here.” Kincaid considered those words and tried not to let his disappointment sink into his belly. “Then why would you want to meet a wizard from the west?” “That’s a question for the masters.” Be a master here. No. “Is the school far?” Deniz smiled. “Just the Inner City.” “Then lead the way.” Kincaid fell into step with the hecaerae as they strode down the main avenue of the Middle City. The massive walls loomed over the buildings in the shadows, and Kincaid couldn’t keep his curiosity in check. He looked like an immigrant to Pilaetium, and that was fine with him. The Inner City overshadowed everything in Caesea. Even the City Council and grand docks of Caesea were no match for the soaring cathedrals, golden roofs, elaborate marble, and flower-lined rows. Here in Pilaetium, palaces and churches gleamed in the sun. Deniz slowed his pace and allowed Kincaid to gawk at the wealth. The hecaerae ignored the stares and glares of the people looking at them. The wizard’s presence avoided unnecessary questions from the guards and members of the watch. They came to a stop in front of a ten-foot wall with perfect masonry. Ivy grew up the brick walls like a leafy tapestry, and white marble crowned the wall. They followed the length until a pair of guard towers soared to the heavens. An elaborate gilded gate stood open as an inviting gesture to the knowledge that lay within. With the wizard as his guide, Kincaid walked into the school. The manicured grounds were immaculate. Gardeners fought the changing seasons and replaced the dead flowers with new growths. Other servants used handheld buckets to water the grass between the paths among the buildings. The decorative walls of the school encompassed ten buildings. Each structure had signs in gold lettering, and the ever-present ivy gave a distinguished feel to each edifice. The doors were made of exotic wood and delicate metal fastenings. Kincaid shrunk with his worker's clothes. He expected one of the supervisors to get him to work on the landscaping. Deniz led him forward into the campus and walked him along the paths toward the academic circle. Three buildings stood in the center of the paved loop. “These are the schools of Theurgia, Kincaid. For young students who demonstrate power at the earliest ages, we have an elementary school.” As he gestured, Kincaid noticed the building was a single floor with high arched windows to provide ample natural lighting. They continued their stroll around the circle. “This building is for secondary education. The students who grow up in the elementary school come here as their power matures. Older students with natural talent may also find their home here.” The building was also a single floor. “And finally, the pride of Pilaetium and the Empire is the Grand School.” This three-story structure had high arches and towers gesturing toward the sky. Every architectural feature asked the viewer to look skyward and imagine the heavens smiling down on this old facility. “This is the oldest building on the campus. Once a church, the Hecaerae of Theurgia bought this structure as the centerpiece of its school system. They modified the inside to serve as classrooms and laboratories. Now it is a testimony to the enduring power of magic in the Empire.” Kincaid paused and marveled at the stained glass work in each of the arched windows. Some of the colors and the craftsmanship reminded him of the work of the glassblowers in Caesea. No doubt they could afford the world-renown glassblowers from Caesea and have the art assembled here. “I’m impressed with the school, Deniz. But why are you giving me the tour?” “We’d like you to stay, Kincaid.” Kincaid stopped and looked at the academic circle. The university was beyond his dreams, and he wondered if Magi Cormac would have the same feelings about this dedicated school. “We even have a dormitory. Many students come from the Inner City, but most reside in the Middle City. They show for classes and their practice sessions. Some need a place to stay and focus on their studies.” “I can’t afford any of this. We barely made our way to Pilaetium.” Kincaid’s voice was above a whisper. His heart hung low in his chest as he looked at the fantastic wealth gathered here. “We have scholarships for the most talented and hardest working. If the masters see something special in you, you won’t pay a thing.” “I can’t believe it.” “Then let’s go to the administration building.” They walked by the faculty offices. Of the buildings on campus, this one was the most functional. Kincaid imagined it was the home for clergy at one point in the city’s history. The administration office entrance was open, and a roaring fire welcomed travelers to the waiting room. A brick chimney guided the smoke away from the room. Plush carpets covered the floor, and cushioned chairs and couches filled the waiting area. Kincaid couldn’t imagine how many people could be applying to this school to demand a waiting room of this size. Deniz disappeared through one of the doors. Kincaid meandered and gazed at the artwork of the school's founding leadership. Men and women in the Theurgia robes kept their unending vigil from their gilded frames. “Kincaid, you’re in luck. Three masters will be along shortly.” “What does that mean?” “Well, it’s a chance to enter the school. The rule requires at least three masters to determine acceptance. They’ll come and grab you.” Kincaid settled into the chair and sunk into the cushion. The painted faces stared down from the walls, frowning with his discomfort. Kincaid tried to crush his thoughts of inadequacy as he looked at the elaborate furnishings. What was he doing here? Following a dream. “Magi Kincaid?” The voice was gravelly and rumbled from within a man’s chest. Kincaid jumped up and turned toward the speaker. He was an older man with a volume of robes that couldn’t cover the girth of his belly. “Just Kincaid, sir.” “Well, we were hoping for more.” The voice grated deeper as he turned away with deep breaths trying to propel his weight. “We should still give him a chance.” Another person appeared at the door, a woman with pure white hair. Her thin frame stood in stark contrast to her fellow master. Her eyes danced with the reflections from the fireplace, and Kincaid thought she could peer into souls. “We did wait for him.” Another voice from another doorway. This man was the classic image of the ancient wizard. Bent over from the weight of his years and a balding head offset by a long white beard. He must scare the students. “I traveled to Pilaetium from Caesea to learn about my magic.” “Ah, then you came to the right place.” The fat man didn’t bother to turn his body around with the comment. The woman rolled her eyes and gestured for Kincaid to follow them. A wide hallway led to carpeted stairs. More pictures with masters from previous decades hung on the wall. At the top of the stairs was a common room twenty feet on a side. A lone table with five chairs stood at the opposite side of the room. The masters made their way to the center three seats. Kincaid stood with shifting feet and fidgeting hands in the middle of the room as the masters settled into their places. Servants appeared from a side room and brought drinks for those at the table. “We have been looking for a Magi from the west,” the woman started. The fat man snorted. She shot him a look and then continued. “We heard the reports of the power used in Caesea, and we understand you were involved.” “I fought the sorceratti of House Atros, and she was killed in the combat. The power we wielded was enough to destroy sections of the city.” The old man nodded as Kincaid spoke. “Then you should show us some of this vaunted power,” the fat man said as his fingers curled around the golden goblet at the table. Kincaid summoned a stream of power, and his soul leaped with joy. The song of the arcane grew to an orchestra waiting to unleash its greatest symphony. He sensed a trickle of power grow into streams from the three seated across from him. Their magic felt different from the sorceratti he fought. His heart swelled with the passion of the moment. Here, he didn’t fear the consequences of his power. This could be home. Kincaid found the sources of heat from the oil lamps and the room's fireplace and created a fireball in each hand. His magic longed for the release, to show more than the simple display of power. Kincaid banished the fireballs with a thought. “Interesting.” That was all the older woman would say. Kincaid didn’t let his confusion stifle his flow of energy. He summoned a rainbow of power and turned it into an arcane globe around him as protection against gathered forces. The power seeped into his skin, and he let himself glow with the energy within. The old wizard just kept nodding. Kincaid wasn’t sure what else to do with these masters in the room. He closed off the sources of power and waited for them. “That’s it? A bit of fire and some raw arcane energy?” “No, of course there’s more. Lightning is easy, and I can work with the very air around us.” “I say no.” The fat man went to his drink. The woman leaned forward into the table. “You have a great deal of strength within, Kincaid. But is this the extent of your abilities?” Kincaid glanced between each unyielding face. The large man wouldn’t make eye contact with him, and the old wizard kept his nodding. “The extent of my abilities is killing multiple sorceratti and destroying a section of a city. I don’t know what you are looking for.” The old man smacked his lips and said, “Something more like this.” He closed his eyes, and Kincaid felt the rush of magic. In a moment, he filled the entire room with images of dancing couples. Sparks flew from their feet with the measured pace to an unseen orchestra. The sounds of strings carried their tune to the beat of the dance. “Or this,” the gravel voice added as the dancers disappeared. Kincaid's lungs gasped as his body hungered for air. He panicked as he looked to escape the room. He summoned a surge of magic, and the oxygen returned. The old woman looked from across the table with a thin smile. In a blink, the examiners were gone from the room. A moment later, the table, chairs, carpets, and wall hangings winked from existence. Everything was gone. And then back. “Magic is more than the basic elements, Kincaid.” Her voice had the sound of regret. “I can recommend he start in secondary school.” “Bah, at best he can start with the elementary school. Magi indeed.” “I say no,” the smacking of lips stopped, and the old man no longer nodded. The woman looked between the two men and shook her head. “Kincaid, this is not the school for you. Deniz will lead you out.” Kincaid’s mouth was dry, and his feet barely followed his commands. He was escorted to the gates of the campus and left alone.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Sting of Failure",
      "content": "Kincaid - Sting of Failure Kincaid sat at the bar with his head clutched in his hands. The beer was adequate for his needs, and the barkeep left him alone with his sorrow. The trip from Caesea challenged his determination, but the dagger of rejection tore through his heart. There was no other plan. Kincaid followed a dying man's wishes, and he needed to understand the powers tearing apart his soul. Using magic was different in Pilaetium. The schools taught more than he could experience on his own. Magic’s curse held him back from experimenting on his own. And now he wouldn't learn anything in Pilaetium. When he began as an apprenticeship in carpentry, he worked for scraps of food and a warm place by a fire. His desire to succeed fueled his success in the shop where he was poised to become a master. Magic changed everything in Kincaid’s life, and now the same magic threatened failure. Did he abandon his power and go back to carpentry in the Empire? They must have a guild, but he could start over in this city. A new life was possible. He wouldn’t fear execution for having magic. Carpentry didn’t fill the hole inside his heart. The door swung open, and Sholeh strode in. Her jaw was set, and her cheeks twitched as she ground her teeth. Her face softened when she met his eyes. He must look worse than he thought. “By all that is holy, what happened?” “What happened to you, Sholeh?” “The blacksmiths. They will not accept me back in the guild.” “At some point, you have to tell me the rest of that story.” Her firm jaw softened. “I will, but not now. What happened?” “I found the Theurgists.” Sholeh waited for Kincaid to continue. They came to Pilaetium for the schools of magic. “They tested me, Sholeh. And I failed.” “But you are a magi…” Her disbelief tore through his heart. She wanted him to succeed and learn as much as he did. “But not good enough to earn a place in their vaunted school.” “What kind of test?” “The masters wanted to see my range of magic. I think they assumed something special from a magi of the west. They weren’t impressed with what I did. I just don’t know enough, Sholeh, and I won’t understand this power.” “You can. You need to try the other school.” “And fail again?” “By all that is holy, you will not give up. We made it to Pilaetium, and we will find you a teacher.” She was right, again. There was another school here, and Kincaid would ensure he didn’t fail. Sholeh’s beverage arrived, an orange juice thick with pulp, in a small glass. The Empire's expanse gave the people of this city more options than the standard fare of wine and beer, and Sholeh didn't drink. The door opened again, and a rush of red clothes entered the main room. Adelaise held the pommel of her long blade to steady its swing as she strode toward the bar. She paused as she caught sight of the pair. With three fingers, she motioned for another round. “Whatever you’re drinking, we’ll need more of it.” “Sounds like our first day in Pilaetium was not a good experience.” As the mugs appeared, Adelaise turned toward Kincaid and Sholeh. “What have you two been doing?” Kincaid spoke first. “I went to the school of magic in the Inner City—” “Wait, you can use magic?” Kincaid caught his thoughts midstream and looked at the mercenary captain. “Yes, I thought you knew that.” Adelaise’s head turned from Sholeh to Kincaid. One eyebrow raised. “You came here for education.” Not a question, a realization. “Yes. Just for the schools of magic.” Adelaise slumped lower in her seat. Her shoulders rolled forward, and she cupped the mug in her arms. She didn’t make eye contact again. “What happened, Adelaise?” Sholeh’s voice was insistent. “I will face the guild to defend my decision to hire you. And I’ll stand trial to see if I keep my captaincy. I don’t think it’ll go well.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid fought in self-defense in the caravan.” “That will be the best selling point. But Xenres will use the time to prepare witnesses and concoct an alternative story.” “Then you need to bring in the merchants.” “Kincaid, I can’t afford to produce the merchants. They banished you, and I left with you. That will not play out well. Even with a transfer of my contract, there's a case I still broke the terms by leaving.” “But we’re talking about you losing your rank.” Kincaid’s voice was getting too loud in the inn. At least they were the only patrons. “I know. But that doesn’t matter to the merchants. They’ll find another captain with an available company to defend their merchandise.” “What about you, Sholeh? You look the way I feel.” The change of topic was abrupt, but discussions of the trial were over. Kincaid didn’t want to spend more time on his failure. Sholeh tried to turn away from the confrontation, but emotions welled up in her eyes. “I went back to the blacksmith guild.” “Blacksmith?” Adelaise probed. “Yes, you saw my work on the caravan. I was a smith here first, and then I moved to Caesea to continue my schooling. The level of work in Caesea is far better than anything in the Empire.” “How long ago?” “I started training here five years ago.” “And they won’t take you back.” “Not after the way I left the last time.” Adelaise pulled a long sip of her frothy beverage. She placed the mug on the bar's polished surface and glanced to see where the barkeep was standing. He remained out of earshot from their conversation. “What happened at the school, Kincaid?” “Rejected me.” “So, what happens next?” Adelaise waited for either of them to respond. “I find another school. Perhaps the Damithians will take me in.” “Why bother with the school if you are already a wizard.” “I’m not. I’m more carpenter than wizard.” “But that’s how you killed that man and wounded the others.” The words hung in the air with an accusation. “Yes. I did.” Kincaid didn’t back down from the challenge. Adelaise nodded and rocked back and forth on her stool. “Then you two need to help me with my trial.” “I can't admit I’m a wizard, Adelaise. You would have to explain why you didn't know what I could do. And then when the schools find out I've used my powers to kill people...” “But you could show them what you did.” “And then I could end up in prison for killing that man on the road. The belief I was facing down four people and fought in self-defense got me free. That's not self-defense when people think I can kill four people with a stray thought. It changes everything.” “He is right, Adelaise. We cannot tell this information at your trial.” “But you can help with the version of the story we used with the merchants.” “We can do that,” Kincaid agreed. He didn’t like where this was going. Between the Blacksmith Guild and the Blade Guild, he was involved in too many things in the capital city. None of them related to the reason for their journey to get here, to find a school of wizards for his powers. But he owed Adelaise for getting them to Pilaetium and taking care of them since. “I wish there was an easier way. Three major failures are not the way I would want to start any journey. Our luck has to change soon.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Dream",
      "content": "Kincaid - Dream Rejection, disappointment, determination. Kincaid stared at the wooden ceiling. He pushed away the emotions and listened to the regular breathing of Sholeh’s sleep. Slumber claimed his mind and dragged him into the dream world. Magic surged unbidden into Kincaid’s veins and ignited his body. His soul howled in delight with the power pounding through his heart. Kincaid’s heartbeat raced as he fought for control of the magic invading every cell. This dream world sought to claim his life. The arcane forces submitted to the young magi's willpower, but it infused every particle of his being. His skin crackled with the energy within, and his chest hummed with power at every breath. He opened his eyes and tried to orient himself to his new surroundings. This was the most vivid dream of his life. His vision swirled from violet to a yellow filter. His mind recoiled at the colors of his environment that not only shifted but also made little sense. He was in a corridor with an arched roof. As his eyes peered through the shifting light’s swirls, granite blocks defined the structure, and the walls vibrated with the pulse of magic. Kincaid couldn’t understand how granite walls pulsed. His magic offered sight beyond human vision. The whole place defied Kincaid’s perceptions of reality. The corridor led downwards into darkness, but the yellow and violet swirls in his vision made lighting unnecessary. He wanted to turn around to find where he came from, but his torso and feet wouldn’t obey those commands. Something, or someone, compelled him to move downward. He advanced silently. Kincaid glanced down; his feet never touched the stone floor. Instead, he glided. The stuff of dreams propelled his body. As he descended the shallow slope, the walls became wet with moisture. Tears of glowing blue started at the arch's apex and then trickled along the walls to form puddles on the floor. As the pools of strange water gathered, they ran down the slope toward the bottom of the passageway. Kincaid noticed the pulsing magic matched the beat of his heart. Each throb met a pulse of energy in the walls. The pattern of the strange light in his eyes also matched the rhythm already in his veins. Connected? Yes. The voice was closer than ever. The sound came from the bottom of the corridor, not just in his mind. In a rush, Kincaid propelled himself forward to the end of the passage. With no need to move his feet, he appeared at the bottom. His heart rate and breathing never changed from the effort. A pool of water glowing with the blue power puddled in a vast entry chamber. A stone archway framed the thickest door Kincaid could imagine. The wood's craftsmanship was beyond the talents of the greatest masters of Caesea, and the work looked like it predated the founding of the island city. His hands traced the grains of the realm’s rarest woods. Exotic hardwoods from across the world were joined flawlessly together. A brush of his fingertips could not detect the attachment, and his eyes couldn’t find the fine lines. With magic coursing through his veins, he reached his senses into the structure of the door. His mind recoiled at the intricate patterns of wood that went below the surface. Individual pieces didn’t exist in this door. He found them interwoven and joined in a way that shouldn’t be possible in the physical world. He pushed his mind deeper into the door, resting his fingertips on the wood. Magic oozed from his fingers. Traces of power pushed back. Characters etched in the surface beyond human sight glowed in response. Kincaid rubbed his hands across the surface of the door and found magic infused in every part of the door. It was ancient magic. This power was beyond the confines of any soul. The magic simply was. Kincaid pushed his soul deeper and sank through the door. He felt tiny and small as his mind found only darkness. The strange filters of light in his vision faded, replaced by the depths of hungry darkness. Fear seeped into Kincaid’s soul as he found himself untethered to either dream or life. All he had left was his soul, the fragment of his being. He clung to all he had left. Your connection to life is strong. Very strong. “What are you?” More who than what. Your words are too limited to allow you to understand. “Then show me.” You are the wisest of all who have made their way here. Wisest indeed. But you are not ready. “Ready for what?” What comes ahead. “Why are you in my mind?” Interesting perspective and so unimaginative. Kincaid clutched the wisps of his being and pulled them back into himself. He rebuilt his soul one strand at a time before the darkness claimed the whispers of light. “Then enlighten me.” What makes you think I am in your mind? Kincaid shuddered from the deep cold of his soul. The awareness of self faltered at the notion he was something other than himself. Swirls of light formed at the corners of his awareness. Kincaid couldn’t call it his vision because he had the firm sense he wasn’t with his body. No, he was beyond his body. Someplace different. Someplace greater. And the voice was leading him farther. You are starting to see it now. “I don’t understand what I’m seeing.” You will. Your destiny is here, and you will do everything to find this place. “Where am I?” The laughter within Kincaid’s head was disconcerting. He felt off balance and spinning in the darkness with the voice. It was stronger than his grip on his own soul. Kincaid understood he only existed at this moment because the voice allowed it. The light pulsed again. This time, the flashes occurred to encompass every nuance of the rainbow. Like the rainbow, the colors were beyond his reach and transparent to see through them all. He saw the shape of a figure, human. But it was beyond his mind to understand the scale of the figure. He had nothing in the darkness to compare it against. Do you want to see your next vision? “I think I am seeing it now.” This is the now. The vision is of the future. “If it is like the one in Caesea…” Yes, but darker. Your path will challenge the Empire itself. The frail institutions will covet your magic, and you will have to fight back against them all. You have something they want. Something you can be. Something yet to be. “No, I don’t want this. This isn’t what I was meant to be.” You do not have a choice. “I will use my free will and—” A joke. A fiction of imagination of some priest impressing an audience. Kincaid pulled the rest of his soul together. Magic infused his spirit and gave his life strength. He was stronger here. The veins of power pulsed, and he thumped with the edge of control. The voice needed him. It feared him. Afraid of what he might do. Kincaid smiled. Good, magi. Very good. Kincaid found his body, his mind, and his soul. He rushed back into the real world. The laughter rang inside his head. The voice wasn’t afraid of him at all. He had to talk to the masters in one of the schools.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Collision Course",
      "content": "Kincaid - Collision Course Dried sweat caked Kincaid’s exhausted body. Salt crusted his forehead, and his muscles groaned as if he’d fought a day-long battle. Kincaid’s mind staggered back from the embrace of darkness and through awareness muddled by a sleepless fog. The room was silent, except for Sholeh’s regular breathing. Gloom blanketed the room, and Kincaid could see his breath as he tried to slow his panting breath. Sholeh didn’t stir. Their quarters were crafted from wood, not stone like his vision. The entire inn didn’t have an arch. The blackness didn’t have a tint, and there was no sentient awareness lingering in his consciousness. Just a lack of light before the sun made its ascent. Kincaid was alone, even in his mind. He tugged off the sweaty clothes in the morning quiet, cold drying his damp body. Rummaging through his sack, he grabbed his spare shirt and pants. Before his feet hit the frigid floor, he pulled on his boots. Kincaid glanced back once at the sleeping Sholeh. Her face was at peace as she curled under the blanket. Her chest rose and fell with each deep breath. He hated leaving her like this, but he needed to get the voice out of his head. The lock to the door clicked behind him. The pre-dawn capital was quiet with empty streets. The first fingers of smoke traced the morning skies as bakers brought their ovens to cooking temperature. It was too early for smiths to stoke their flames. Kincaid wandered through the poverty-stricken sections of Pilaetium, but his mind guided him back to the Inner City. He was unsure of his intent, but the direction felt right. The gates remained closed through the nighttime hours. Guards allowed passage through the gate, but they screened each traveler before admittance into the city's upper-class areas. He approached the nightwatchman standing at his post. “I’m on an errand for the School of Damis.” The watchman snorted as he examined Kincaid’s attire. The man stepped in closer and raised his oil lantern to view Kincaid’s face. “Why should I believe you?” “Because you wouldn’t want the hecaerae wondering what I’m doing standing at a gate.” Kincaid let a smile play across his lips. “I’ve heard better excuses to enter the Middle City. Come back in an hour when the doors open.” “I can’t wait that long.” Kincaid summoned a trickle of his magic and allowed it to light his fingertips. A glowing ball cast dancing shadows against the city walls. The watchman stepped backward and clutched his polearm in his fists. He lowered the blade with a curved hook to defend himself. Kincaid continued his smile and cocked his head to one side. The man came to his senses, withdrew his key from his belt, and opened the small gate to the Middle City. “Thank you, and I wish you a good evening.” Kincaid gave a curt bow and flourished with his hands. Foolish to use magic this way. Kincaid couldn’t afford to scare every guard. He ducked to get through the small door and stepped over the high lip. The ducking and stepping motion allowed a sentry on the other side to decapitate an attacker. But Kincaid was only traveling and not attacking. He ignored the bored member of the City Watch on the other side. The streetlights were still out in the Middle City. The darkness was different from Kincaid’s dream, and yet the vague memories seemed everywhere around him. He traveled upwards along the straight streets toward the Inner City. The School of Damis couldn't be hard to find, and he wanted to be there as gates opened. Kincaid found his way to Carpenter Street. The lights were off, but the smell of wood hung in the morning air.",

      "title": "Sigurd - Working Man",
      "content": "Sigurd - Working Man One last job. Sigurd’s shoulders burned. He wedged his fingers into the gaps between the stones as his fingertips ground into the mortar. His legs throbbed from the pressure of holding his body against the wall. Will be my last job if I slip. Another month and the frost and ice would prevent even the hardened northerner from scaling the walls. He’d need specialized gear to make the climb, and the noise of spikes and ropes would make the most bored guard investigate. He had to finish the job tonight. Sigurd didn't dare adjust his position while the sentries by the window told their war stories to pass their time until their relief arrived. They hadn’t moved for the past fifteen minutes, and if they didn’t move on soon, Sigurd would have to change his plan. His employer wouldn’t be pleased with another delay. The sound of boots walking away was the cue Sigurd needed to resume his climb up the exterior wall. His dark clothes were loose against his tall body, but stains of sweat marked his exertion. Fingertips found the windowsill, and his legs positioned for a surge upwards. Getting his eyes above the sill was enough to confirm the guards moved away from his entry. The window was open a crack. Weeks of careful planning and surveillance led Sigurd to a discontent servant in this house. For a few coins, the plan came together with an unlatched window. The young man pulled the length of his body upwards and into the corridor. His booted feet contacted the carpeted floor. Excellent quality. Spared no expense for the carpeting. His prize had to be here. Sigurd stretched out the kinks in his arms and shoulders, and he loosened his legs from the climb. He didn't want to scale the way he came in, but he'd be ready. The hallway stretched to his left and right. A single gas light at the corner of the hall sputtered to give faint illumination, but the walls were bare. On the upper floor of the residence, Sigurd expected more affluence. In the houses he frequented in the middle of the night, people kept their wealth close at hand. Their precious items would be squirreled away from the rest of the world. Except for the items his employer wanted from this house. He padded along the carpeted floor, staying near the wall. If a floorboard creaked under the carpet, the guards would return to investigate. Fortunately, the padding was also thicker away from the trafficked path. Sigurd slinked deeper into the merchant’s private quarters. Sigurd crossed the hallway on the balls of his feet and paused at the single door at the end of the hall. He looked for flickers of light under the frame and then leaned in to place his ear against the door. Quiet. He reached for the handle and gave a careful push. The lock rattled its resistance to his entry. Cursing his luck, Sigurd glanced back toward the hallway. The owners would shut themselves into their chambers. His employer didn’t have enough intelligence on this household for Sigurd to do the job alone. His luck was coming up dry. He reached to his hip and grabbed his dirk. The two-foot blade slipped out of the oiled sheath and reflected the low illumination. Sigurd pushed his shoulder against the door to see if it opened from increased pressure. Nothing. Stout door. Using the blade, he worked the wood around the lock. He hoped for a simple latch that would give way to the point of the weapon, but the door would not reveal its secrets. The dirk returned to its sheath. Sigurd glanced down the hallway one more time. He held his breath to listen if the guards patrolled back to these chambers. Counting to ten, Sigurd then pulled back one stride. He slammed his boot on the lock, closest to the door frame. The explosion of wood and fragmenting metal echoed down the hall. Sigurd burst into the room and was pleased to find the bedroom empty. At least he’d picked the right night for the owners to be out. The trappings of wealth went straight to Sigurd’s gut. There was enough here to steal to set him up for a lifetime of luxury. He could buy a ship, pay for a crew, and wage wars on the seas. If he only had more time. And different instructions. The bedside tables were his first objective. Hands moved in a blur, pulling out drawers. Bags of wealth, paper, and trinkets splashed across the floor. The other side was more of the same with feminine mirrors and supplies—nothing he needed. Sigurd raced to the trunk of clothes at the foot of the bed. A heavy lock hung on stout metalwork. He calculated the damage from a blow with his sword, but he’d only mar his blade. He’d have to grab the whole chest and leave the room to search it. No time. He looked back toward the nightstands. The chest was too easy. Too predictable for the average thief to waste time on the locks. The drawers strewn across the floor were too prepared. Sigurd thrust his hands in the back of the nightstand. The jingle of mail and the thud of heavy boots approached. They’d raise the alarm when they saw the splintered wood. His fingers poked and prodded at the back panel of the nightstand. Click. A false panel slid open. A small chest, just like his employer mentioned, fell into his hands. Sigurd threw the item on the bed. It was too large to fit under his cloak, and he didn't bring a bag to hang his loot from his belt. Instead, he used one of the drawers to shatter the beautiful artwork of the chest. Shouts raised in alarm. Steel rasped clear of sheaths to prepare for combat. Sigurd flipped open the cracked chest and saw it was empty. Not a single item. The owner took the necklace with him. Complete failure. Footsteps at the door and the shout of surprise. Sigurd reached back over his right shoulder and tore the hand-and-a-half blade from its sheath. He gripped it in two hands as the guards pulled up short. They carried shorter blades, better suited for working the hallways of wealth. Both looked like they knew what they were doing with swords, but the giant who faced them was no stranger to warfare. Sigurd weaved a dance of steel in front of his body, the blade cutting through the air. The guards pressed into the room. “Put the sword down, thief.” “Take it from me.” The lead sentry made the first swipe, and steel rang against steel in the bed chamber. Sigurd’s legs were in motion as he closed the gap on the closest guard. Instead of pulling back and taking his long blade into action, he lashed out with his left fist. He hit the man’s chin like a sledgehammer. The force of the blow dropped him to the carpet. Before the other guard could pull back and block the door, Sigurd surged for the exit. The whisper of a blade swinging at his retreating backside never found its target. Sigurd picked up the pace. A window escape was out. Sigurd wouldn’t make it down a floor before a guard threw something off the ledge on him. He’d have to reach the main staircase. Sigurd doubled his speed as the patrol shouted in frustration behind him. He rounded a corner and slammed into a servant. Blankets and clothing flew into the air. The body crumpled to the ground, and Sigurd never registered the face of the hapless servant. He hoped it wasn't the woman who left the window unlatched. He liked her. But he’d lost three paces from the impact, and the pursuit drew closer. Sigurd leaped over the railing and plummeted a half flight of stairs. His boots pounded on the stone staircase as his legs absorbed the impact of the fall. He sprinted faster down the stairs. The ground floor was already awake with activity. A single guard stood at the doorway. The crossbar was still in place, barring the exit as the man drew his blade. Mail armor hung to the guard's knees, and he crouched as Sigurd continued his unrelenting surge toward him. Their blades met and slid to the cross hilts. Sigurd exploded outwards with the strength of his shoulders, and the man slammed backward against the doors. His helmeted skull rapped against the wood. The northerner reversed his blade and smashed the pommel into the man’s stomach. Breath rushed from the guard, and his mail clattered to the ground as he gasped on his hands and knees. The crossbar was designed for a pair of guards to lift its weight and length. Sigurd didn’t have time. He pushed up with the bar with his left hand and let it fall to the floor with a raucous thud. Sigurd sprinted into the courtyard as more shouts chased him. His pace took him full speed to the wall, and he threw himself upwards. With a practiced leap, he pulled himself up and over the protection of the manor house. He landed on the other side. With a patrol of the city watch only ten feet away. The giant northerner shook his head with his luck again. His dark clothes and bare steel over four feet long didn’t need the most celebrated detective to figure what he was doing jumping over a wall. Instead, he shrugged his shoulders and smiled. Sigurd returned the blade across his back with a practiced movement and sprinted away from the town watch. Shouts of men and women tore through the night air. Weapons rattled, and feet pounded against the cobblestones.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Immigrants",
      "content": "Kincaid - Immigrants After bluffing his way past the guards at the Inner City gate, Kincaid wandered the streets looking for the School of Damis. Even slumbering, the Inner City breathed power. The roads were straight, clean, and in perfect repair. Oil lamps burned at regular intervals, creating overlapping pools of light. Gold and precious gems were standard as decorations and reflected the glowing lights. When he reached the secondary streets, the lampposts were farther apart, but the mansions protected by fences highlighted the city's wealth. Trying to find an elite school in the land of the elite was more difficult than he expected. Not like he had anything else to do this morning before Sholeh woke. Shouts crackled in the morning air and surprised the young carpenter. Even though he couldn’t make out the words, the tone was out of place for the Inner City. The voices approached, and Kincaid turned toward one of the small streets off the main path. He didn’t need to get involved in something else in the city. In a moment, Kincaid realized the echoes of pounding footsteps were heading his way. Blasting around the corner, the tallest young man Kincaid had ever seen bounded with an effortless gait. His braided blond hair swung with each swing of his powerful arms. The northerner’s face was relaxed even as his lungs pumped to keep oxygen flowing to his legs. Through the chase, he held a half smile. The man constantly glanced over his shoulder toward the pursuit, but the runner’s blue eyes caught sight of Kincaid. He broke his stride to avoid a head-on collision between the pair. “Hail and well met. You must move aside.” His chest pounded out a consistent breath. The man was younger than Kincaid’s first estimate. A pommel with a massive grip poked above his shoulder, and the dirk at his hip was as long as Kincaid’s sword. “You there, stop.” Guards skidded around the side street and heaved for breath from the chase. The giant man scowled at Kincaid and spun on his heel toward the pair. “Are you sure we must do this?” The man’s voice was firm and carried the power of a mountain stream rushing over a waterfall. The young man was everything Kincaid was not. “You are under arrest.” The guards approached with caution. Kincaid glanced between the newcomer and the town watch. He didn’t need this now, but the blond immigrant was fearless. “You caught me in an alley. We will see who walks out.” The newcomer reached over his shoulder and drew his steel. “Hold on. Please.” Kincaid pushed between the adversaries. “This isn’t the way we should start a morning. An immigrant in the city is under suspicion, but it shouldn’t end in death.” “Aiding the suspect? You’ll join him in a cell.” They were catching their breath. Their halberds were awkward for the alley. Shoulder to shoulder, though, they would be a threat with the long weapons. “Now, I’ve just been walking through the city.” Kincaid kept his palms open and away from his body. “Before dawn in the Inner City. Another thief.” “You should join me, yes?” The low voice was at Kincaid’s back. “You're kidding, right? Never going to be able to explain this.” Kincaid shot his words over his shoulder. Now he was committed. “Lay down your arms and surrender. We’ll put in a kind word for you when we issue charges.” The watch didn’t want a fight that could leave them injured or dead. Kincaid looked at the standoff and summoned a rush of power. His mind relished the touch of the arcane, and his veins pumped with the fire his heart craved. Each beat was a delicious reminder of what he could do. With a careful twist of arcane might, he softened the cobblestones at the patrols’ feet. Once perfect cuts by trained masons, deep cracks appeared in the rock. “Now, run.” Kincaid sprinted past the giant and plunged deeper into the alley. His new ally didn’t hesitate. The guards tried to push off and give chase, but the stones collapsed under their effort. Shouts of surprise echoed as they tripped in the magic holes and crashed in a jumble of mail and weapons. The large man was right on Kincaid’s heels as they scrambled down the alley toward one of the secondary roads. Sounds fell away as they reached the major road. The northerner peered back along their route for pursuit. Finding none, he turned those eyes back on Kincaid. “Hail and well met. I am Sigurd. Perhaps you have heard of me?” Kincaid raised his eyebrow and looked at the young man. “I’ve been here for a day, rejected by schools, and chased by the watch. I haven’t heard of you. Kincaid.” The giant youth shrugged his shoulders and gave his smile again. “They will double the watch at the gates. But the door will open with the light. We should keep moving.” “What did you do?” Kincaid needed a step and a half for each one of Sigurd’s strides. Sigurd huffed. “Working. For the wrong people again, yes?” “Again? That doesn’t sound like something I want to be part of right now.” “If they saw your red hair, you will make the report.” Kincaid didn’t need that reminder. The magi hoped the alley's darkness revealed only an insignificant man overshadowed by the northern giant with the massive blade. The length of that weapon should be enough to distract any guard. If not, he had no idea how he would explain his morning to Sholeh and Adelaise. “You have a place to hide?” The northerner had already caught his breath and looked like he was taking a stroll in the morning air. “I can’t go back to my room in the Outer City.” “No. Here.” “I’ve been in the Inner City once.” “Come with me.” The pair headed deeper into the array of alleys. For this section of the city's wealth and power, passages ran between manors, mansions, palaces, churches, and gated areas. No one with this fortune would have their property line up next to another. The shadows of the alleys provided their cover. The morning sky painted its red hues and subdued oranges. Kincaid couldn't enjoy the sunrise because he was lost. His new companion moved through the streets with confidence. “You know where you are going?” “Away from the watch, yes?” Kincaid shook his head and sighed, panting to keep pace with the big man’s strides. Sigurd guided the pair to a place where the servants gathered to filter into the Inner City before the workday began. None used the main gates and endured the scrutiny of the guards. Instead, they came in through a small sally port away from the elaborate entrances. Several inns stood near the massive doors and hugged the looming walls. “A better place to hide, yes?” Kincaid was more skeptical than Sigurd’s optimism. They moved inside the bar to find a gathering of perhaps twenty men and women. The room’s sounds rose and fell with the casual conversation of people accustomed to the privileged life in the Inner City. None paid the distinct immigrants more than a passing glance. Their day would start soon enough, and two mercenaries or personal guards wouldn’t draw their attention away from their last moments of freedom. Sigurd pulled up to the bar and motioned for beverages. Mugs appeared with draft beer, and bowls of breakfast followed. “A toast, yes?” “Early for beer, don’t you think?” “We cannot toast with water or juice. That would be stupid.” Not waiting for the toast, Sigurd threw back his head and enjoyed the beverage in his fist. An excellent brew. Far better than anything Kincaid tasted within the city. “The School of Damis. Do you know where it is?” The smile vanished from the man’s face. He spat to the side and looked back. “Magic. You should not need this.” “I know, but I have to meet with them. I wanted to be there as the sun came up. As their gates opened.” “Nothing good comes of the wizards.” “You know where they are.” Kincaid let the statement hang in the air between them. Sigurd nodded. Using a wet finger, he drew a map on the bar to show how to get to the school. He then went back to his breakfast made smoother by his beer. The smile was gone. “I should go then, Sigurd. I must see these wizards this morning. I’m at the Broken Wagon Inn in the Outer City. Not within the walls. Thank you for the breakfast and the directions.” Sigurd refused to comment. “Stay safe.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Damis",
      "content": "Kincaid - Damis Kincaid eyed the workers gathering their belongings for a day of work. The banter ended, and gazes shifted downwards to avoid eye contact. They assumed the persona of servants even before they reached their employment. The Inner City was the home of the powerful, and these workers were essential to the capital's continued operation. However, they were servants and workers unable to climb the rungs of power. Kincaid felt bad for each one of them as he watched them file out the door. As an apprentice and journeyman in Caesea, he never felt this bad about a day’s work. Kincaid followed them out and matched their posture as he roamed the streets. Sigurd’s makeshift map was helpful. The roads followed the path his fingers traced on the bar, and the directions based on Sigurd's descriptions were better than trying to follow street signs. As he walked the last few streets, his heart pounded with anticipation. His future came down to this one major school. In a moment, Kincaid stood in front of the gates of Damis. Unlike the old wealth of Theurgia, Damis had a different feel as he peered inside. Where Theurgia had gates covered in gold and elaborate artwork, Theurgia had simpler walls and wide doors. The buildings inside the courtyard were still impressive. Classical designs inspired the school's grounds. White marble columns rose and joined with domes and arched roofs. The simplicity was also its elegance as each line and column was an intricate part of the design. The campus had the feel of an ancient senate ready for day-long debate. The guards at the gate looked Kincaid up and down. “Deliveries at the back gate.” “I’m not here with goods. Could you direct me to the administration building?” “Why are you here?” “I’d like to apply to the school.” The guards chuckled at him. “The building to the right. Good luck.” They watched his travel as he made his way toward the building. Kincaid guessed they’d stop him if he moved deeper into the campus. Massive oak doors blocked his way. The craftsmanship was excellent, with smooth cuts and perfect angles. He pulled on the doors, and flawless balanced amazed him. The thick wood swung with the slightest tug. Kincaid waved and gave the guards a crooked smile. They turned away and faced the street. He stepped inside. Instead of plush carpeting and elaborate tapestries, Kincaid’s boots banged against the marble floor. Paintings by the great masters of the Empire hung in exotic wooden frames and drew the eyes to the wall. He never had time for art galleries in Caesea, and his mind rejected this to be an administration building. His feet dragged as he gawked at the collection. But he caught a glimpse of someone sitting at a desk at the end of the hall. The man looked up from his paperwork with annoyance etched into his face. Dark eyes assessed Kincaid’s approach and dared him to approach the desk. “You must be in the wrong place.” Kincaid pulled up short of the table. This wasn’t the welcome he was expecting. “I came to apply to the school.” “This isn’t an audition. You can find the theater—” “I need to talk to someone who can test me.” “I’d say you’d already failed.” Footsteps echoed as someone else approached. The pace quickened as a silence grew to a canyon between the men. Kincaid was not moving because of an obstinate door guard. “Cordelon, who is this?” A young woman caught up in the volume of her robes rounded the corner from behind the columns in the grand hallway. She had piercing brown eyes under close-cropped brown hair. She shot the doorman a look, and her gaze shifted toward Kincaid. “Someone seeking an audition.” She turned those brown eyes on Kincaid, and her face flashed recognition. Her eyes softened, and the young woman glowed from within. The young magi felt he was now on display. “Not an audition, Cordelon. Admission. And we should admit this one.” “Why, because the rabble asked nicely?” “No, because he is a Magi from the west. Caesea, in fact.” The woman walked around Kincaid, and his face grew hot from the unusual inspection. As she completed her circuit, she came forward and held out her hand. “I take it you’re Kincaid?” “I am. How could you know that?” “You are distinctive and the only Magi I know. I’m Darya.” Kincaid considered the odds to this point. Nothing had gone his way, and now he ran into another obstacle. “I came here to learn from your school.” The desk clerk, Cordelon, deepened his scowl. The woman nodded her head. “Then we will go to admissions.” “Good luck with your audition.” Kincaid ignored the comment and followed the woman to the back of the grand hallway. She told Kincaid they’d have to wait while the school gathered something she called a quorum. The excited whisper of robes swishing and soft boots hurrying toward an unseen room echoed everywhere. Kincaid caught the formal robes of the Damithians. The next thing Kincaid noticed was the people gathering were old. Finally, his youthful escort summoned him to enter the room at the back of the hallway. He stood at the center of a sweeping concave table. The table had seats for perhaps seventeen people, but only seven masters with thick gold braids at their sleeves sat at the table. “Welcome, Magi Kincaid.” The older woman at the center of the group gave him a smile. “We understand you wish to learn from us?” Kincaid straightened his posture. “I do.” “Tell us about your education.” A man near the edge asked without sounding confrontational. Kincaid fumbled with his hands as he considered his answer. No point in lying here. “I've learned through experience.” “Then no formal training…” “No. In Caesea—\" “Perhaps you could describe the theory of arcane and physical world interaction.” The woman asking must assume this would be an easy one. She offered him an encouraging smile. “Other than summoning the force to affect the physical world, I don’t know.” Several shook their heads. Another one tried a question. “Then tell us how you discovered your powers.” Kincaid pressed with the truth again. “I didn’t know I had them for the longest time. But I found myself in the fight for my life, and the magic came.” “A fight for your life? What did you do with your power?” “I ended up killing several people. Magic filled my fists, and I used my power to change the environment.” The council became silent. Even his escort couldn’t make eye contact with him. “If you step outside. We must decide.” Kincaid shifted his feet to the door. No one would take him in. He’d come this far, and none of the schools would take him? Back to carpentry? He promised Magi Cormac. His dream was real. His escort cleared her throat and waited. She mouthed the words “I’m sorry” as she waited. The act of kindness allowed him to steel his heart. The Council waited for him to reach the center of the room, and Kincaid paused with his feet shoulder-width apart and clasped his hands behind his back. He never looked down. He forced his gaze on each member of the committee. Make them blink first. “Magi Kincaid, on behalf of the school, we regret to inform you we are unable to approve your candidacy.” The woman in the center made reluctant eye contact. Rejection. Formal rejection. “Your methods regarding the use of magic are considered unethical by school standards. We debated if you could join us and harness this energy. Alas, we thought we could not.” Kincaid nodded. He turned away from the group and headed to the exit. The padding of footfalls hustled to keep up with his pace. His escort must be paid to get him out of the school without trouble. No matter. He’d go. “Kincaid, wait.” Kincaid didn’t pause a single step. She clutched his arm and tried to pull him close. “There is another way.” Kincaid stopped and faced her. “I’m listening.” “We meet in two days in the Middle City at the Falling Roses. And I’ll show you.” She walked him out of the school without exchanging another word.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Summons",
      "content": "Adelaise - Summons “Hail and well met.” The voice came from a tall young man with braided blond hair and blue eyes that sparkled like scattered sunlight reflecting off a frozen lake. His smile was broad and open. Adelaise did not understand why the man was approaching their table. Kincaid shifted in his seat and glanced around like he wanted to be anywhere else but the common room eating a meal with his companions. Sholeh cocked her head to the side and watched his nonverbal language. “Kincaid, you did not tell them.” “I didn’t think you would come to our inn.” Adelaise got up from the table. Even members of her guild weren’t so brazen with the display of weaponry, and he wouldn’t catch her sitting while she figured out his intent. “Adelaise the Red.” “Sigurd. Thief and Warrior. Perhaps you have heard of me?” “Fortunately, no. And we don’t need a thief or warrior.” “A table of foreigners.” His eyes caught the weapons the women carried. “And warriors. With Kincaid’s invitation, I am here.” Adelaise turned to the young man and waited for his explanation. “Yes, I met Sigurd yesterday. It was more of a collision. Or a run-in.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid. I have heard you tell better tales than this.” Sigurd walked away from the group. His long strides took him to the bar where he placed an order. Adelaise appreciated the time for her companions to discuss without him hovering over the conversation. “Faster, Kincaid. Before the giant returns.” Adelaise kept her anger under control. “I was in the Inner City, trying to find the School of Damis—” “You were gone before the sun came up, my friend. Looking for a school before the morning light?” “You got through the Middle and Inner City gates at night?” Adelaise cocked her head. This pair was unique from any other contract. “Do you two want to tell the story? It might be faster.” The women checked their next questions and waited for Kincaid to continue. “He was running from the watch, and our paths crossed.” “By all that is holy, the watch is searching for you?” “I don’t think they are looking for me. It was Sigurd they were chasing through the streets.” “But you picked his side.” Adelaise sighed and rolled her eyes. Her job was about Sholeh, but this inexperienced man continually diverted her attention and changed the plans on the fly. She might have to separate them. “I didn’t so much as choose a side as help him get away. Immigrants often have to band together.” He held his pleading look as he glanced toward Sholeh. Adelaise caught that she was having none of it. Sigurd returned to the table and placed his frothy mug and a bowl of soup in a vacant spot. He reached back and grabbed a chair from an adjacent table. His weight settled into the wooden structure, and he took a long drink from his mug. “This is terrible.” His nose scrunched, and he wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve. “And yet you stay with us.” Adelaise looked over the length of his worn pommel. The leather had been replaced several times, and this weapon was no stranger to combat. Sigurd chuckled as he spooned a heap of food. “Sigurd, you’ve joined the table of failed immigrants. We get rejected by guilds, and we find danger regularly. And that’s always more fun in a capital city. You’ve found an interesting group.” Kincaid’s effort to disarm the situation fell flat. “Then we should change our luck, yes? Find a good merchant to steal from and make our way into the world.” Another long drink. “By all that is holy, we will not be stealing from merchants in the capital. Is this how you found him, Kincaid?” The carpenter turned away from the question as his cheeks heated to a soft pink. Adelaise wasn’t sure how this would go for their growing group. Keeping Kincaid and Sholeh nearby was enough work for the mercenary captain, and this new northerner would make her life harder. She didn’t need the complications. Adelaise motioned for their meal from the curious staff, but she wasn’t interested in a mug of beer this early in the day. She sized up the newcomer. The man plowing through his food was young. He was trying to grow a beard and mustache, but the stubble was uneven and not impressive. But the size of his arms and muscles flexing at his forearms showed a warrior used to a hard life. He lived by those swords. Their meal arrived with glasses of juice and bowls of the same soup Sigurd already plowed through. “You drink the juice of fruit? It is not safe to drink.” Sholeh raised her eyebrow, grabbed one a glass, and then pulled a long drink. “It is very safe.” “Then, it is not wise. Good beer, ale, or spirits are the best, yes?” “No, Sigurd, they are not. The capital is a dangerous place, and always having the edge of alcohol is its own danger.” Adelaise put a hand on Sholeh’s forearm. “She does not drink, does she?” Sigurd leaned over and confided in Kincaid. Kincaid leaned away from the northerner with a horrified look across his face. He would not pick sides again. Adelaise pulled her bowl toward her and caught the edge of a piece of paper under the pot. She dragged her breakfast closer and palmed the scrap into her hand. Sigurd watched her action, but he couldn’t have seen her movement. Instead, Sigurd motioned for another drink and leaned back in his chair. His eyes landed on each of his new companions, but Adelaise found his face unreadable other than the playful twinkle in his eyes. Instead, the group turned back to their meal. No conversation was necessary as they ate, and anything would be awkward around their new companion. Sholeh didn’t hide her displeasure with frequent glares in the northerner’s direction. Kincaid leaned away from the young man to build space, and the carpenter kept his eyes focused on his food and drink to avoid another discussion. Voices rose above the sounds of the common room. “You are still here, Adelaise.” This day keeps getting better, Adelaise thought. “I’ve only been in the town for a few days. Where else would I be?” “Making our job easier.” A pair of mercenaries crossed the room. Chairs scraped, and tables banged as people left their breakfast. Workers readying for another day of labor didn’t want part of a fight between mercenaries. The barkeep and his help sized up the weapons. A battle here would be destructive. “That depends on what you are looking for. We could make your job very hard.” “No doubt. But we aren’t here on a contract, and you know we aren’t assassins. Just messengers today.” “Historically, messengers don’t carry their weapons. You look like soldiers expecting trouble.” Most mercenaries preferred certain weapons, but all were careful within the confines of Pilaetium to avoid the guard and the watch. They doubted Adelaise would take their message well. “Only because we were coming to you.” The pair glanced toward Adelaise’s companions. “And it appears the new company you are forming.” “Not a company.” She cut off that line of thinking. “These two were my hires and got me kicked off the caravan. This one is recent.” “Save your story for the inquiry.” The woman mercenary spoke for the first time. The man glanced over at her and gave a slight shake of his head. Adelaise caught his meaning. They hadn’t come here for bloodshed. “Adelaise the Red, the Guild of Blades summons you to face your inquiry. At this board, a jury of captains will review your actions as captain under contract. Do you understand this summons?” “Yes, am I permitted to bring witnesses?” The pair faltered. They usually had to deliver a message, and the recipients would be quiet and accept their fate. Mercenary captains were different, and no one remembered the last time an officer faced a disciplinary board. “Yes, I would think so.” “Good, you may finish your task.” Back in command. The man pulled paperwork sealed with red wax out of his cloak pocket and handed it to Adelaise. “The board meets this afternoon, an hour before the dinner bell. Do not be late.” The pair turned away from the table. Adelaise turned the letter over in her hands. A formal summons with the seal of the guild. She’d add this paperwork to her collection of administrative actions, but this time it was serious. It’d be a disciplinary board, which meant they already completed a preliminary hearing. Captain Xenres got to them and delivered his tale. Or maybe members of his company. With the summons in her lap, she slipped the scrap of paper delivered under the bowl into her hand and reviewed it. We have much to talk about. Same place, tonight. You don’t have a choice. The handwriting was a flowing script, clear and defined—more meaning than a scrap of paper. Sigurd had a raised eyebrow as he caught her actions. Thief indeed.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Trial",
      "content": "Sholeh - Trial Sholeh's life collapsed around her, and she could not imagine how to fix it. Their ongoing expenses drained their small cash reserve, and if the mercenary captain lost her status within the guild, they were in trouble on a new level. The group committed everything to Kincaid's magic. And they would not resort to thievery. How could Kincaid help this thug? If the watch was hunting the northerner, the entire group would fall under suspicion. If the Inner City noted their small group, Sholeh shuddered. “I hope you two will come with me to the inquiry.” “Three.” “I’m glad you can count, Sigurd. But I need the two witnesses there, not another observer. And I don’t want the guild to think I’m assembling a new company for hire.” “If you must fight your way out, you will need another sword. I am not sure if Kincaid carries one, yes?” “By all that is holy, we will not fight and die in the guild house. Especially the Sword Guild.” Sholeh’s fires burned from this man’s desire for action. The trial would be a spectacle, and the toughest fighters in the Empire would be in attendance. All muscles, no brain. Wisely, Sigurd kept his mouth shut. “Sigurd, I’m not sure you should make your way to the upper city.” Kincaid tried to reason with the man, but his tone was too soft for Sholeh’s liking. He sounded like he was pleading rather than directing. “I was not chased in the Middle City. The watch between the cities do not share notes. Makes life as a thief easier, yes?” Kincaid placed his hand on Sholeh’s forearm. He gave a comforting squeeze before she unleashed her fury on the man. “Adelaise, we would be happy to accompany you to the guild.” Kincaid diverted the discussion away from Sigurd. “Thank you. When we go, we won’t bring weapons. Best clothes and mouths shut. You’re witnesses on my defense and not part of the process. The guild hires cutthroats, warriors, and killers. We don’t need or want to make enemies here.” “Understood. When do we leave?” “Pack your things, put on your change of clothes, and we leave in an hour.” Sigurd didn’t move as Adelaise, Sholeh, and Kincaid rose from the table. He drank another sip of his beer as they went to the staircases. “By all that is holy, you have to get rid of him.” She waited just long enough to get out of earshot. “I helped him and told him where we were staying.” “Why?” “Because we have no options right now. I’ve failed at two schools, a guild has exiled you, and now we are off to face an inquiry on behalf of another person carrying swords. Maybe we form a company.” “That has not worked out for us yet. Not in Caesea and not on the road.” “Not fair, Sholeh.” They changed into their spare clothes, and Kincaid wisely remained silent. The guild house stood perpetual watch over a crossroads of the main thoroughfares of the Middle City. It was a fortress with a crenelated rooftop perfect for archers and muskets. Windows on the top floor were wide enough for firearms or bows to cover a wide arc. The granite blocks on each floor were cut perfectly to complicate attackers trying to scale the walls. The designers allowed for some luxuries. The bottom floor had broad windows. But the windows had interior and exterior shutters to provide a better level of protection. Given the Middle City location, this structure had not been under siege for at least a century. The windows were unadorned glass, but the metalwork was elaborate. Sholeh caught the level of mastery for each sconce, fitting, and piece of metal scrollwork. Functional and subtle. The first floor held the gathering hall. A great fire roared at one end of the room as attendants stacked logs to keep the cold at bay. An expansive wooden table stained nearly black waited with matched cushioned chairs, and smaller tables scattered near the front of the room. The rest of the hall was filled with unmatched chairs for the people who would gather to observe. People of all sizes, colors, races, and genders filled the room with the low thunder of conversation. Few noticed the arrival of the accused, and the discussions continued. Sholeh didn’t expect the range of mercenaries to show for this inquiry. Punishment in Pilaetium was usually decided in private and sometimes carried out in public. This was a show to the members and the people who would hire companies from the guild. She doubted the trial would be fair. Someone had to face judgment. Adelaise wound through groups, nodded at some supporters, and ignored the scowls from those who wished her to fail. Kincaid and Sholeh followed in her wake. “Remember, you are witnesses. Not my counsel and not a team of barristers. That won’t help me here.” They reached the front of the room and stood near the closest table facing the judgment bench. Sholeh couldn’t think of anything else to call it. “Do we join you at the table?” Kincaid asked. “No, that would make you part of my party in this discussion. You aren’t. Sit in this first row behind me so you can make your way to the front of the room when called.” Kincaid nodded, and Sholeh looked around the room. Captain Xenres pushed his way through the crowd as he focused on his table at the front. He dropped a stack of paperwork at his place and leered at Sholeh. Adelaise kept her eyes forward and pretended to study the arms and armor around the room. The voices fell quiet, and chairs scraped as people made way for the staff of inquiry. Five senior captains marched up the center of the room and took their places behind the high-backed chairs. None looked toward Adelaise. At least none looked toward her accuser. As they sat down, the visitors and members of the guild grew silent. The nervous energy of the room transitioned to shuffling feet and whispered words. Sholeh didn't like the vultures circling over the pending carcass. “Members of the guild, we gather to consider the terrible claims against one of our captains. We welcome guests from other guilds to see that justice is done quickly and fairly. Captain Xenres, you have the floor.” Sholeh expected a comprehensive opening statement from the captains sitting in judgment. Even a summary of charges or warning to the audience would have been a better sign. This inquiry was too open-ended. The gathering fell silent to catch each word. Xenres began with a description of the merchants and their contracts. He explained how he hired his regular company of sellswords and set their rates. They expected an uneventful journey until the mountains and the passes. Even groups of bandits and lawless mercenaries wouldn’t pose much trouble to the experience he brought to the expedition. “But I didn’t expect the threat to come from within.” He paused for effect among the crowd. No gasps or whispers, just silence met his theatrics. He continued, “I knew Adelaise didn’t have a full company. What I didn’t expect is that she would hire unvetted sellswords in the lands of Caesea.” Sholeh gripped Kincaid’s arm and pushed him into his seat. This wasn’t the time for a legal squabble. They couldn’t afford to lose their best ally in the city, and Kincaid couldn’t ruin this argument for them. The male captain on the far right spoke first. “Captain, why were you so worried about the members of another company? Did you review your roster with her?” Voices murmured throughout the room. “No, sir. But who she hired on would make a difference when we came into contact with enemy forces.” “Of course. But do you normally worry about this when contracts are signed?” The opening move faltered, and Xenres relented, “No, sir. But we would discover the hires were incompetent before we reached the mountains. My company became concerned that the right side of the caravan was vulnerable because Adelaise hired people that weren’t experienced enough to do their job.” “I see, continue.” “My company reached out to Captain Adelaise and her company to offer training. To help out in the nights and mornings to make sure they had the skills to work with my experienced team.” Sholeh glanced over and caught Adelaise’s eye roll. No doubt, the members at the table noticed her expression as well. “And?” “She refused. But the most dangerous times were the threats of the young man sitting behind her. The red-headed one. The ones he made against my company.” Sholeh nearly sat on Kincaid to keep him in his seat. They wouldn’t be able to shout down the lies, and they needed to let this run its course. So far, the judges didn’t appear impressed with the contrived story. She wanted to tell him, “Do not blow it.” Kincaid settled back into his seat and let the air in his lungs out in a long breath of frustration. His butt stayed in the chair. “His actions would lead to the murder of one of my company. He would even wound two others.” The female captain in the middle of the table took up the questioning. “This man fought against three of your mercenaries?” “Four of them.” “By himself?” “Yes, he did.” “And this was one of the guards you worried couldn’t hold his own in the caravan’s defense?” No one breathed as the question hung in the air. The fire cackled with the captain’s predicament. The trail of smoke up through the stone chimney marked the passage of time. “Then perhaps you should have hired him to train your company,” one of the other captains spoke. The woman in the middle let the traces of a grin cross her face. She looked into the seats behind the tables. “Master Merchant Djau, you were party to this contract. What can you say about the fight amongst the members of this guild you contracted?” Sholeh turned her body around to look at the merchant. Instead of travel clothes, he wore beautiful silks tailored in the most current fashions of the Empire. His clothing was a blend of colors designed to catch the eye and impress the viewer. “The fight forced a trial of the young man, Kincaid. In the name of discipline, we banished him from the caravan. We had to take action for the simple fact he killed another guard and wounded two others. We didn’t want to take him to the capital for punishment.” “Why not?” the leader of the captains asked. “Because I believe the young man fought in self-defense. In my years of travel and life in this world, I’ve never seen a man choose to take on four trained and armed individuals.” Captain Xenres slumped in his chair. “But that is not all?” “No, ma’am. We lost faith in your guild.” Voices rose to shouts and drowned out any other questioning. One of the captains drew her dagger and slammed her fist with the pommel down on the long table. The thunderclap ended the commotion, and the senior captains glared at the interruption. “Viewing this inquiry is a privilege, not a right. If you can’t stay silent, I will clear the room.” The audience complied, and then she continued, “Please explain.” “As the young man, Kincaid, packed his belongings, another member of Captain Adelaise’s company abandoned her duties. The blacksmith Sholeh left with the young man.” Fear jabbed straight into the middle of Sholeh’s chest with the accusation. Her breath came fast as the room turned toward her and measured her up. She chewed the inside of her lip as the words hung in the air. “What did the captain do about this violation of contract and breach of discipline?” “She made it worse. She left with the pair.” The captains stood up in their seats before the commotion could get out of control. Sholeh could not believe the words from the master merchant. They’d saved Kincaid from a horrible death, but the accusations were damning to them all. Sholeh tried to see Adelaise’s face, but the woman stared forward into the roaring fire. “Captain Adelaise, what do you have to say about the Master Merchant’s words?” “Nothing, ma’am. They are true.” The voice that was usually so confident and used to delivering commands came across as a whisper. Sholeh was impressed at the honor of her bearing and willingness to accept the price. “Then we stand in recess while the board of inquiry makes a decision.” Chairs scraped again as voices jumped back into conversations. Kincaid jumped to his feet and approached Adelaise. Sholeh was right behind him. “Adelaise, what happened?” “They brought the real charges against me. It was never about you and Sholeh.” “But our testimony—” “Won’t be asked for. Many witnesses can confess I left the caravan with the two of you. I saved the inquiry some time by admitting the truth. I left with you.” “I don’t understand—” “I don’t expect you to. I contracted you, and I broke my contract. Even the transfer of my company is a breach.” She turned away from the pair from Caesea. Her eyes were unfocused as she stared off to the back wall of the room. “We have to do something, Sholeh.” “By all that is holy, we will not. You can see how this is. We are strangers here. Guests, yes, but strangers. How could we possibly sway this board?” “Magic.” He muttered the word under his breath but with conviction. “By all that is good and right, you will not.” Sholeh’s temperature rose ten degrees. “Kill everyone in the room? Just burn the accusers down? What?” Kincaid plopped his small form down on the chairs. “No. You’re right.” “Say that again, my friend?” “You are right. I can’t believe Adelaise sacrificed everything for us.” Sholeh looked over at the woman. “That is something we still have to discover.” The board of inquiry returned a moment later. Captain Xenres grinned from ear to ear and shook hands with many members of the guild. The outcome was not in question. “Take your seats, please. The charges brought before us are serious and threaten the foundation of our guild. We take our contracts seriously, and we are paid well for the risks we take for the services we provide. When someone abandons their post and their company, we could charge with cowardice, abandonment, or desertion.” Sholeh watched Adelaise flinch with each of those words. She wouldn’t show it, but Adelaise’s soul was being cut out of her body. “Adelaise, please stand.” The woman stood on her sturdy feet and placed her hands behind her back. Her eyes focused over the heads of the members of the board. “Adelaise, you are hereby stripped of your rank of captain. You may not apply for the rank for five years. Additionally, you are on probation for six months, unable to apply for a contract or serve under one of our captains.” The room soaked in the powerful words. “Do you understand the penalties?” “I do.” With a practiced move, Adelaise reached up to the clasp of her cloak. With steady hands, she twisted the device off and let her cloak fall to the floor. She dropped the pin on the table and walked out of the room between the stunned viewers. The board of inquiry did not stop her. She wasn’t a member of the guild. Sholeh turned to watch the crowd part in front of Adelaise’s departure. No one dared a word or gesture. Sholeh’s heart broke as Adelaise walked away from her life. And then she caught an older man with the colors of one of the leading churches observing her. How did they know she would be here?",

      "title": "Kincaid - Magic",
      "content": "Kincaid - Magic “I wasn’t sure if you would show.” Kincaid watched the young woman emerge from the alley near the inn. “I didn’t think hecaerae would hide in the shadows and wait for failed applicants.” “I’m not representing Damis.” “That’s good because I traveled from Caesea to reach these schools, and they’ve soundly rejected me. Magi or not.” “What is a magi?” “I don’t know. I haven’t been aware of my powers to understand what these titles mean.” Why did the hecaerae from these schools think magical discussions were street topics? Kincaid shook his head. “Why have a title like magi?” “It wasn’t bestowed on me like a degree. I was in prison with a person Caesea called magi. Before he died, he called me Magi Kincaid.” The white lie burned inside Kincaid’s gut, but he ignored the feeling. “Then you passed a test.” She spoke the words with certainty. Maybe she resolved something in her mind. “We should go.” “Where?” The woman reached out and grabbed Kincaid’s hand. The warmth of unfamiliarity and the urgency of the grasp sent shocks up to his elbow. She smiled at him and gave his arm a pull to get his feet in motion. After a moment, Kincaid remembered to watch where they were going. She took him through a wandering path by the merchant class' growing wealth, but they never stopped. The hecaerae had a destination in mind, and she wasn’t sharing it as they strolled down the maintained streets of the Middle City. The small road was nondescript. Without warning, she nudged him on a street without a sign, and the houses lined up in mirror images of each other. This residential district was subdued compared to many others as the owners didn’t splurge on expensive façades. This neighborhood dug into the Middle City and hung on with all its strength. Darya pulled a key from her pouch and glanced up and down the street to check for observers. Confident no one cared about the pair, she approached a plain wooden door in the middle of the adjacent houses. With a twist and click, Darya slipped inside, waited for Kincaid to follow, and clasped the door behind him. Kincaid sensed a slight rush of magic as the lanterns flickered to life on the ground floor. The entryway was narrow with the buildings leaning into each other, and the stories split with a staircase up for three levels. The upstairs wasn’t lit with magic, so Kincaid followed her into the simple dwelling. The floor creaked and buckled with their steps. Kincaid knew that he could rebuild this flooring with a few hours of work and have it silent and strong. He suspected the wizards wouldn’t ask him to do that work. The ground floor opened into a kitchen area with a stove and a common area decorated with comfortable furniture. Couches and chairs stuffed with soft cushions were haphazardly arrayed. None of the furniture matched, and Kincaid assumed it was castaway furniture accumulated over the years. Darya gestured to the chairs and went behind a counter to grab two glasses. She eased out a cork from a bottle of wine and filled the long-stemmed glasses. “I’m assuming wine is ok?” “Ok, for what?” “To drink.” “You asked me to find you at an inn. We could drink alcohol anywhere.” Kincaid longed to push his senses into this house, but the hecaerae staring at him would sense his effort immediately. “That was so we could meet. Now we need to talk.” The woman slid out from behind the counter with the two full glasses. Kincaid politely took the goblet and placed it on the table next to him. Darya eased her body into the couch next to him as a smile played across her lips. She raised her glass to her lips without taking her eyes off him. “Why did you come to the school?” She took a sip of her red wine. “To learn about magic. Why else would you go to school?” She was close enough to feel her warmth radiating out, and he tried not to fidget in the comfortable seat. “What did you notice about the hecaerae judges?” “They were uncomfortable with me as a magi.” “No, think harder.” “They didn’t appreciate how I used my magic. Not like I had a choice.” The woman tilted her head forward and smiled at the corners of her mouth. She took another sip. “Getting closer.” “I didn’t show them the power they wanted to see.” “What about the people?” “Distinguished. Experts.” “Old.” “Yes, and that too, why?” “Do you understand the price of magic?” The blast of lightning hit Kincaid’s awareness and stunned him. The woman’s smile grew, and she reached out a squeeze Kincaid’s hand. She let go and put her glass back on the table. “What is this place?” Kincaid gestured around the room. “A place of study. The kind of learning that you won’t find in a school.” Her hand slipped back into his. “Was your experience at Theurgia the same?” “Rejection, yes. But those wizards had me show some magic. They explained they wouldn’t take me because I focused on the physical elements. That wasn’t talent.” “Were they old?” “Older, yes.” “My point is the same. Why did you think you’d find answers at a school led by the ancient?” Kincaid couldn’t argue with her logic. What could old people teach him about arcane power? The curse of magic applied to everyone, but could they know about the secret of his strength? He couldn’t share that yet. “My magi sent me here as his dying wish. He wanted me to learn from a school of magic.” “We can still do that, Kincaid.” Kincaid reached over and took a sip of his wine. The red was sweeter than the dry he usually liked, but the warm rush down his throat was perfect and smooth. He cleared his mind and tried to look into his future. “I’m listening.” “You know the schools don’t practice magic. They can’t if they wish to grow old. Teachers instruct theories and concepts. Only the smallest traces of power are used to prove concepts.” “What about the ranks? The gold on the sleeves?” “Primarily awarded for theoretical pursuits and academic papers. Peer review means arguing about firmly held beliefs. The schools learned the dangers of magic in the very earliest years and limited student exposure.” “So how do I learn?” “With us.” “Us?” “There is a group of students that decided to learn more about magic. Controlled, of course. But we need to experience more about the force we can control, and we must find a way to get around the curse.” The schools and all the hecaerae didn’t know, and Kincaid couldn’t share exactly what they wanted. Trust first. And then he could make this commitment. He relaxed back into his chair. “I’m interested. Definitely interested.” “Tell me about the fight in Caesea?” “I’d rather not.” Her eyes shifted away from Kincaid and looked toward the floor. She was too eager to understand what happened. “I’d heard the stories of the destruction and loss of lives.” “Probably all true, even with some exaggeration. The fight between two wizards is terrible. The power has no bounds.” “You don’t look like you carry the scars of that fight.” There it was. This group of students was determined to discover his secret. He’d find a place among them, but they would reveal what they know about magic as well. “I fought defensively and tuned my magic to the minimum required to keep from dying. That’s why the blasts were out of control and did so much damage.” She nodded her head in agreement. Kincaid wasn’t sure she completely believed him, but his story was plausible. He doubted these hecaerae had experience with fighting other wizards. If their schools focused on theory rather than practice, they wouldn’t refute what he said. “I’d like you to meet the others.” “I think you can teach me what I need to know.” The smile returned to her young face. She was energetic and attractive. But was she attracted to him or his power? “You can stay here.” “I’d rather return and not draw attention.” “Ah, the blacksmith.” She looked away from his eyes. “When is the next time you’ll meet with the others?” “We try to meet every three days. So, we meet again tomorrow. They already agreed you could join us.” “Thank you, Darya. I can show myself out.” He left the young woman behind with her thoughts and her glasses of wine.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Church",
      "content": "Sholeh - Church “Should have kept my cloak,” Adelaise said to no one. Emotions and outbursts marked the days since the trial. Adelaise didn’t know what to do with herself. She wavered between waging a one-person war on a guild of warriors to finding herself at the bottom of a bottle. Sholeh gave Sigurd an element of grudging respect as he tried to balance the former captain’s emotions with a joke or a drinking partner. The eyes of that priest from Adelaise’s inquiry wouldn’t leave Sholeh’s mind. If the church tracked her down within the hundreds of thousands of people of the city, she couldn’t stay idle. Her friends, especially Kincaid, would be at risk. As Sigurd and Adelaise took on another round of drinking and Kincaid disappeared to discover more about the city, Sholeh decided on her only choice left. She’d go to the Inner City. Her shaking hands pulled through her few belongings. Sholeh’s bag was still empty after their caravan duty, and she had nothing appropriate to wear into the Inner City. The real choice was wearing weapons on her belt. Her hands ran along her hammers as her mind drifted. She decided. She wouldn’t carry weapons into the Inner City. She couldn’t fight what was there with steel. Sholeh didn’t bother to hide her departure from the others and just made for the door. They let her go without a word, and that would be better for them all. The walk through the city brought back memories of her youth. Back then, she didn’t pay much attention to the world around her. Focused on her life and then her escape from the city, Sholeh didn’t leave time to admire the sights. Merchants hawked their wares, workers spent their hours of labor longing for the wealth around them, and powerful men and women ignored the lives beyond their own. The games of power played at every level. The Inner City was the home of the centers of power in the Empire. No one who wanted to gain favor or influence could avoid the requirement to maintain a strong presence closest to the Emperor. Guilds and nobles clamored for attention in this city. And even churches. Sholeh wasn’t sure which church would be her destination, but she’d had a good guess. Five co-equal priests led the churches of the Empire. Sholeh suspected this was to keep the church fragmented with internal squabbles and never present a challenge to the throne. She assumed she’d have to visit all five to find what she needed. The churches' structures were impressive on a level unlike anything she’d seen traveling in other parts of the Empire and certainly in Caesea. These buildings took decades to build with an army of workers and a dedicated staff of professionals from every craft. Each new leader of their church commissioned architects to modify their power centers with the most impressive modern features. Gold and silver were common, and the mason’s work revealed the patient craft of decades of work at every church. Organized religion doled out their fortune to masters of arts at a rate that kept the Middle City prosperous. With the wealth available, churches sought the most celebrated artists from around the world. The competition kept a district of artisans employed and wealthy. The gateway to the first cathedral stood twenty feet high and was the crowning example of lavish architecture with statues, precious materials, and perfect workmanship. And this church had more than one massive set of doors. Instead, it had three locations covering the front of the building. One door was always left open as an invitation for the weary of spirit, as was the tradition. Sholeh’s spirit, however, dragged as she took each step up the polished marble. She slipped into the open door and whispered the entrance prayer under her breath. She crossed through the space before the inner door and walked within the confines of the towering cathedral. She craned her neck upwards to look at the soaring heights. Lights hung from long silver chains suspended thirty feet in the air. The ceiling was at least twenty feet above that. Artwork and sculptures of religious moments and influential leaders comforted the weary traveler and encouraged people to enter. The temple had nooks everywhere for side chapels and places of prayer. Each chapel had an elaborate altar for worship. Still, Sholeh timed her arrival well enough to avoid the prime prayer hours. As she walked the center aisle, she whispered another prayer under her breath for calm. She drove her feet forward to the sanctuary of the church. The displays of gold, master sculptor’s work, and mosaics of precious gems grew in size and value the closer she got to the altar. Sholeh whispered another silent prayer, this time asking for strength. She slid into a pew near the altar and surrendered her worries to the silence around her. Her soul longed for peace even as she doubted she’d find it here. Clergy and other church members made their way quietly up and down the aisle as Sholeh reflected. She didn’t notice one stopped until he cleared his throat. Sholeh glanced up and was surprised to see one of the priests she knew. He once worked a smaller church in the Outer City but found his way to a cathedral since Sholeh turned her back on this. Parsa slid into the pew next to her and looked up at the altar and shared her silence. After a few moments, he leaned over to catch her attention and pointed toward one of the side altars. Sholeh nodded, and the man got up with his robes brushing against the wooden pews. His sandals were silent on the marble floor as he made his way to the side chapel. Sholeh drew a breath and asked everything holy in this church to give her wisdom. She slid off to the side and glanced around to see who else was watching her. “You are fortunate I found you first, Sholeh.” His voice was low and insistent. Sholeh was afraid it would carry around the chapel. “I think it is what the holy one would want.” The man stepped back and raised an eyebrow. “You’ve come for forgiveness?” Sholeh’s fire returned in her eyes and straightened her spine. “There are many things I have done wrong in my life, and there are choices I will always regret. But none of them involve the church.” “Shame on you, Sholeh.” “I am the one who came back.” She shot the words in his face and took a half step forward. “Not here.” “You are the one who pulled me to the side. Yes, here.” “He will find out you are here.” “I expect you to tell him. And now you can deliver a message for me.” “Sholeh, please. Just see him.” Sholeh looked around the side chapel. The metal craftsmanship was worth more than her apprenticeship. As she took in the displays around the altar, the side chapel could be worth more than her shop in Caesea. Images of Kincaid flashed in her mind. His wasted body when he broke out of prison. She imagined the burdens his soul carried from the power threatening to burn him from the inside out. Adelaise’s rigid posture as she walked out of her guild smoldered within Sholeh. And even the big northerner was growing on her. Her eyes came back to the priest she had known for over six years. He’d changed. Once one of the charismatic preachers to the poor and disadvantaged, he was now in a position of power. The band at his wrist meant he was approaching the top. Perhaps he’d be in line for one of the bishops in the Empire. “No. But I want you to tell him I am fine. I don’t know how long I will be here, but I’m working for my living.” “But the guild rejected you.” The words slipped out of his mouth, and Sholeh’s jaw dropped. “I’m sorry, but tell me it isn’t true.” Sholeh collected herself and wished she had Kincaid’s magic. She’d show him and this church a thing or two about power. “By all that is holy, I will be fine. Tell him that.” “Your father wouldn’t want you to swear. Especially not in this church.” His condescending tone was enough. “Tell my father that I am still done, and I will not be staying.” She wasn’t going to keep doing this verbal sparring. Sholeh moved away from the altar and kept her eyes locked on the back of the church. He’d hear about her visit soon enough. She wasn’t waiting around for another lecture. Her soul didn’t find peace.",

      "content": "Adelaise - Secrets “That’s not how people should look when they leave church.” “By all that is holy, why are you here, Adelaise?” Sholeh hadn’t gotten out of the broad square at the base of the cathedral’s stairs. The mercenary in red appeared from the crowds and matched Sholeh’s stride. “To see if holiness found you. You looked pretty concerned this morning. Having a blade nearby can come in handy in cities like this. Even in the Inner City.” Sholeh’s jaw was set, and she glanced around the open area in front of the church. “Not here.” Sholeh picked up a swift pace away from the cathedral. Adelaise followed and used her hand to steady her long blade at her hip. Whatever happened in that chapel, Sholeh was ready to get away. But her emotions distracted her, and Sholeh wasn’t paying attention to her environment. Adelaise examined the people around them, even as she maintained a full stride. At heart, she was still a mercenary captain. In places of high power, the shadows of darkness were always the deepest. She caught the flash of robes as her eyes peered into one of the alleys. Wizard’s robes. Damis? Typically, she’d investigate who had this interest in their walk, but she needed to stay close to Sholeh. Adelaise expected they would stop somewhere in the Inner City to gather their thoughts, but the blacksmith walked straight through to the Middle City without looking back. Guards never bothered people moving to the lower cities. Their interest was always keeping the wrong people out and not worrying about keeping people in. Sholeh picked an inn and threw open the door. The barkeep and one servant glanced up as they strode in. Adelaise smiled at the owner and closed the door behind them. She joined Sholeh at one of the tables. “Now that we’ve set a new city speed record, are you are ok?” “I am fine.” Sholeh wouldn’t make eye contact. “How did you know I was at the church?” “Like I said, I followed you.” “Even Kincaid didn’t follow me.” “He seems to have a lot more on his mind lately. He’s not noticing the changes in you since we’ve been here. You’re carrying a heavier weight. I don’t know everything, but I know that’s not good.” “You are right. I have a storied history with the church. It is one reason why I left this town.” “Just one, huh?” Sholeh smiled. She was genuine in her emotions even as she wrung her hands. Adelaise could see why Kincaid was attracted to her. “Just one, but one of the important ones.” “You can share if you want. Now that I’m finished issuing orders, I can be a good listener.” Adelaise tried her half-smile. “My father is one of the five patriarchs of the church.” Adelaise sat in stunned silence. The contract made sense now, and the spymaster’s continued interest worried the warrior. Adelaise hoped Sholeh couldn’t decipher the emotions that flashed across her face. “I understand.” “You do not. He wanted to use me as a pawn in his games of power. He longed to be a patriarch and would do anything to get it.” Her words fell silent, and Adelaise knew she wouldn’t share more. Instead, they shared a meal together and just enjoyed the company.",

      "content": "Adelaise - Assignment “Why did you send the note?” Adelaise stood in front of the table. She wasn’t in the mood to be cowed by this spy. “I’m done with these games.” “The ex-mercenary captain adrift in the capital is done? You’ll be finished when I say you are.” At least he wasn’t eating now. It was late in the afternoon but before the evening meal started. A servant brought a bottle of wine with two glasses and discretely left the room. “The girl.” “Which one? I have so many to worry about, Adelaise.” “You know damn well what I’m talking about. I know.” “You know nothing, Adelaise. And think clearly about what you’re getting into. You can’t afford to sever your last ties. Your probation may turn into permanent exile.” He poured into both glasses, even as Adelaise made no movement to join him. “Why bring her back here, to Pilaetium?” “I don’t owe you any answers, Adelaise. My employers have my discretion in these matters, and why you brought her is none of your business. You failed as a mercenary when you separated from that caravan.” “I paid the price for that. And I’m done fetching your errands.” “You’re upset, Adelaise, but you’re normally more calculating than this. I can make you suffer without laying a finger on you or your friends.” The words spat like venom and burned through her veins. The poison of this man pumped into her heart and froze her on the spot. “That’s what I thought. I do have another interest, though. The man you travel with—this Kincaid. I have heard he’s far more than a carpenter. Something the schools of magic are interested in. I want to know more.” “I haven’t been following him around.” The words came through Adelaise’s gritted teeth. “He doesn’t talk about what he does. Perhaps bedtime chatter?” Another sip and that devil’s smile. Adelaise thought, don’t take his bait. He remembers everything and catalogs information for profit. “What is the contract for?” “Ah, much better, Adelaise. I want to learn the boy’s interest in the schools of magic. And I want to know what the schools’ interest is in him.” “What’s the fee?” “Oh, how about forgiveness for ruining my appetite for the evening meal.” “That’s not enough to keep me in the city.” “Oh, you’ll figure something out. I’m positive.” Another sip. Adelaise rested her left hand inside the covered guard of her sword. Her movement was designed to draw a reaction. “We will have our reckoning.” “I’m sure of it. But it won’t be tonight. Run along.” One movement and he’d be dead. She wondered if this inn's discretion also meant no questions when bodies were left in private rooms. Some other time. Instead, she left. She needed to figure out more about Kincaid and what she’d have to do.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Return to Magic",
      "content": "Kincaid - Return to Magic “You came back.” “I need to know more.” Darya’s smile warmed Kincaid’s heart. He knew this decision was the right one. “Tonight, you’ll meet a few others. We can show you a few things you may not understand.” They slipped through the deepening darkness to the safe house, and this time Kincaid marked the way in his mind. The lights were already lit as they entered the house. Magic was everywhere tonight, and Kincaid’s soul hungered for arcane power. The flows everywhere in the room were tight and controlled, holding the magic to a minimum. Four other men and women waited on the stuffed furniture. They smiled as Darya led Kincaid into the room. “This is one of our study groups.” “Studying what the masters won’t give you?” “Exactly.” One man stood up first and offered his hand. He was still in his robes of Damis. “Bartalan.” This young hecaerae had energy in his eyes. No, a hunger. A feeling Kincaid knew all too well. As they gripped hands, Kincaid sensed the deep reserve of power within. He hadn’t been able to detect the strength of a person’s magic before. The introductions continued around the room. The group was young, full of spirit, and eager to learn more. They were also wealthy, wearing the finest materials an Empire could offer. Kincaid wondered if they were from Damis or if Theurgia found their way into this group. He’d have to wait. “What is the magic of the west?” Bartalan cut straight to the point. “I think it’s the same as everywhere else. I’m not sure what to use as a reference.” “Based on your soul, right?” one of the young ladies asked. “I wish it was otherwise. But yes.” “That’s why we stopped listening to the theories of magic around here. The elders couldn’t know that much about the practical use of magic,” Darya said. “When I was at Theurgia applying to admission, they asked me to do something else beyond the basic elements. I didn’t know what they meant, and I failed.” “What do you mean by basic elements, Kincaid?” Bartalan asked. “For me, fire, earth, air, and raw arcane power are easy to manipulate. When I fought a sorceratti in Caesea—” “Wait, you killed another wizard?” Darya asked. Her face changed to awe. Kincaid didn’t like it. “Several.” The others leaned forward to listen to his inaudible voice. “I had no choice. My life or theirs.” “You know magic can do so much more than fire and air. We use this power to manipulate everything around us.” Kincaid couldn’t tell if Bartalan was condescending or just regaining control of the meeting. “Show me.” Kincaid grabbed a goblet of wine and settled into a comfortable chair. The group relaxed and turned toward Bartalan. The young man adjusted his robes and closed his eyes. Kincaid sensed the movement of magic, and it was different from the magi’s experience. The rush always threatened to overwhelm and claim Kincaid’s soul. Bartalan started with restraint over the flow of magic. He bent it to his will. Pressure crushed Kincaid’s body. Lifting his hand became difficult. The wood of the mismatched chair creaked under his weight, and his head began to droop forward. Bartalan opened his eyes and smiled. Kincaid’s weight pushed him down, threatening to pull him through the floor. The pressure stopped. “What did you do?” “The force that holds everything to the ground, gravity, can be manipulated like fire. I had gravity increase to make it difficult for you to move. A surge of this energy could be deadly.” Kincaid looked at the others. “What else?” Darya spoke up first, “Imagination is the only limitation to magic. The forces you feel within you can guide your mind.” “The pressure on the soul is always much less when I use what is already around me. The flames on the wall or fireplace are always useful, and I can even use the air,” Kincaid said. “Yes.” Bartalan nodded eagerly. “Now you see why we want to know more than the old ones who run the school. We control the streams of power to learn more.” “But we still pay for the magic.” Kincaid looked at each one of them. Under close scrutiny, they carried the extra weight of years sacrificed in their pursuit of knowledge. Just behind their glances was the hunger for knowledge. And power. “And that is the greatest secret we hope to unlock. If we can slip past the cost of magic, then we could change the world.” Bartalan’s eyes glowed with the power of magic coursing through his veins. Kincaid deflected this discussion. “What else can you show me?” “I love working with light,” Darya said. “The energy is very low for me, and I can make things happen all around us.” An image of Darya stood behind her seat. The duplicate waved and smiled at Kincaid. Kincaid sensed the energy in the room and felt the limited flow of magic. From across the distance and in the dim light, the image looked real. “Bending light takes practice. It’s straightforward to duplicate myself and mirror my actions. But having my image stand while I’m sitting and doing independent actions takes practice.” The extra Darya disappeared in a blink. “Shadows work the same way,” one of the other male students dressed in ordinary clothes mentioned. “As the opposite of light?” “No, not the opposite at all. Shadows are a dark part of this world. They are a piece of us, and they can affect the world.” Kincaid sensed the flow of magic increase again, more than what it would take to manipulate light. The candles no longer flickered, as if they cowered from the encroaching darkness. No, the night lived. The shadows lengthened from the walls and pooled around the feet of the furniture. If Kincaid looked at them from the corner of his eyes, he sensed a substantial nature to shadows that could not be solid. Fear surged in his heart. The demonstration continued as the chairs slid across the floor as if unseen hands pulled them. The shadows dragged the chairs to new positions, and the liquid darkness formed in the seats. Kincaid fought down his urge to back away from the growing darkness. This is all they have? Laugh at them. You’ve killed wizards. Show them what you can do. The voice was everywhere in the den. Kincaid glanced at the study group members, but none looked around for the source of the booming sound. Although Bartalan didn’t break his gaze on Kincaid. The lights flickered back to life, and the shadows retreated to their lifeless reflections. Everyone breathed a collective sigh as they realized they held their breath during the demonstration. Incredible magic. “Are all of you tuned to a particular force or element?” Kincaid looked at each of the students, and he returned the stare back to Bartalan. “We have different strengths, and we certainly favor one power over others. Some, like Bartalan, can use magic across multiple elements at the same time. But the draw on power can be tough on the soul. We don’t do this very often,” Darya said. “Don’t the teachers feel the magic coming from the house? Aren’t you afraid of getting caught with this display?” “The old ones don’t channel much magic anymore. They are sensitive to the flow of magic in the classroom because we are so close. But they worry for their souls and their lives too much,” Bartalan said. “Hard to believe you can escape the notice of the hecaerae.” “Remember, we are around each other in a classroom all day. We keep the flow as small as possible as the newest wizard understands the price. But I haven’t seen anyone worry we might be practicing magic outside of the school.” Kincaid shook his head. “In Caesea, the use of magic is punishable by death. Even if you do it by accident. That’s why I was imprisoned.” “Your story keeps getting better, Kincaid,” Darya said. “But what is your power? What do you find the easiest?” Bartalan pushed harder. “I don’t know. I’ve only used magic when I’ve had to.” “Try it now.” The voice was insistent—a command. The other heads nodded in agreement. The energy among these students was positive and encouraging. He wished the soul of Magi Cormac was nearby to see this. Was this what he wanted Kincaid to find in the Empire? Did he imagine a place where people could use their skills and talents to push the edge of knowledge? But this wasn’t a school. This was a group of students hiding under cover of darkness to ply their arts with no boundaries. No supervision. They exhibited some restraint, but Kincaid wondered what would happen if peer pressure became the norm to push themselves the hardest. Peer pressure. Like right now. If he was going to learn more, he had to show something. He closed his eyes and reflected on the ways these students showed their powers. Kincaid started with restraint, closing off parts of his soul. His mind held an iron grip on his will. His heart thundered in his chest as the first wisp of magic flushed his senses. Show them. The voice was quiet, also watching what Kincaid would do. The young magi threw the voice out of his head and focused on the sense of magic. The arcane power bent to his will, and his mind leaped with joy. He pushed the wave of power in front of him and then around him. He filled the place with his new power and felt the control tighten on the thundering arcane magic. His soul buckled under the assault. He opened his eyes and saw each person in the room, frozen in place. They sat with unblinking stares and faces covered with curiosity and excitement. None moved. The lights caught Kincaid’s attention. None flickered, and none seemed to burn. The lights were constant. Kincaid examined the stream of magic, and he let his mind twist the movement. If he had to describe what he did, he pushed the flood of magic clockwise. The images of the people flowed around his fellow students. Their moment was still frozen in time, but their ghostly shapes leaped to their feet and looked with surprise at each other. They looked with awe and curiosity at Kincaid. Except, Bartalan. His ghostly image was frozen. Kincaid released the magic. A part of his soul disappeared with the flow as the exhaustion set in. Fatigue crashed around his mind as he considered what he’d done. In a second, after the magic dissipated, the students jumped to their feet. They looked around the room at each other, and then they gazed at him with awe and curiosity. All except Bartalan. He hid his expression behind a stone mask. “What did you do?” Darya’s voice was up an octave. She was animated and couldn’t keep her feet on the ground. “I felt it, all of it!” the shadowcaster said. “But I had no idea what you were doing. It was a wave of power around all of us.” Another female student said. “Not around us, in us,” the last male student said. “I don’t know myself. But I watched how each of you controlled your flow of magic and began with that. With the iron will around the flow and the limit to my soul, I found a different power that I never touched before.” Kincaid’s mind raced with possibilities. He could learn all of this, and he could learn it from this group of students. He ignored the cautionary tale in his mind. “What did you see?” Bartalan’s voice was above a growl. The room’s excitement felt the grip of the chill. “I don’t know. It was something I never felt.” “You shouldn’t come back.” Bartalan crossed his arms. The others looked at him with disgust. “Bartalan, no. We can teach each—” “Not until he tells us what he did. We can’t have a wizard here using powers that we can’t experience or understand.” His words began tumbling over themselves. His steely gaze returned to Kincaid. “I saw you all frozen for a moment. Everything froze. And then I adjusted the magic and saw ghostly shadows around you. What you would do when the arcane power left me.” Kincaid rose to the challenge. “Chronomancer,” Bartalan whispered.",

      "title": "Sigurd - Challenge",
      "content": "Sigurd - Challenge “A lady should not be alone walking the streets, yes?” Adelaise spun toward the young northerner. Sigurd kept his hands open and away from his body. If she assessed him as a threat, he wouldn’t get his dirk clear of its sheath before she moved. Never mind his sword. He tried to disarm her with a smile. “Men who stalk mercenary warriors at night often don’t wake up.” “Stalk? What is the meaning of this work stalk? Like crops?” Adelaise relaxed her pose. At least she wasn’t ready to cut his heart out, but her eyes were slits, and her eyebrows were furrowed. Sigurd had to try harder. “Why are you following me, Sigurd?” “Because I must find work.” “By following me?” “In this group, everyone walks off to different parts of the city.” “What do you mean, everyone?” “The smith walks to the Inner City to church. The carpenter goes to schools of magic.” Sigurd paused to spit to the gutter of the road. “And you come to this place. A great place to find merchants to steal from, yes? But not for you to eat or drink.” Adelaise didn’t answer right away. She crossed her arms for a moment and then looked around the streets. “Not here.” The woman set off at a brisk pace. With Sigurd’s long legs and natural gait, he kept up with her. But he made sure he didn’t get out in front of her. He didn’t want to challenge her for leadership. They approached the Middle City gates without drawing attention. The guards noticed the giant next to the mercenary warrior but remained silent at their approach. They ducked and moved through the small door still open for night traffic. Thankfully, none made a move to challenge their passage. “Here. And you’re buying.” Sigurd noted the bar looked like every other upper-class bar in the district. Good structure, thick doors, and well-lit. This sign was faded so badly that Sigurd couldn’t make out the symbol or the name. The Bar without a Name. Sigurd took stock of quiet conversations, luxurious clothes, and rings and necklaces. He’d remember this place for the future. He had a half-grin on his face as Adelaise caught him analyzing the scene and rolled her eyes. “Perhaps I should introduce myself here, yes?” “Sure, let them know they should put all of their wealth on the table. We can cut our way out of here. How many guards can you take?” Sigurd looked around the room. “I’ll take the close two.” “Nice, and leave the lady with the other ten? What a gentleman.” “No, warrior and thief.” “Can we find a place to sit before the patrons think we will steal from all of them?” Sigurd slipped through the room and claimed a table near the wall. With private meeting areas, the booth was the best he could do. He slid the sword over his head and placed it in the booth. The thunk of the metal hitting the wooden wall caused their neighbors to turn and stare at the pair of warriors. Sigurd ignored them. He motioned for the barkeep to bring over beverages. “This is good, yes?” “Good enough. People here aren’t interested in a couple of sellswords willing to spend a few coins. We can’t talk in the Inner City without too many ears listening.” “Is that why you were there? To talk to the ears?” Her shoulders tensed, and her jaw tightened. “You ask too many questions for a northerner with a big sword.” “Only one that fits my hands right.” Adelaise sighed. “There’s so much going on, Sigurd. So much that none of us understand.” “You lost your captain job.” “I did. And I thought it was for all the wrong reasons. Sholeh and Kincaid are good people. But they are far more than they seem. I wish I could understand them.” “Ask.” “Like it’s that easy for people to tell their darkest secrets.” “Not all secrets have to be dark. Some need to be shared in the light, yes?” “You have a unique viewpoint.” Adelaise leaned back in the booth and watched the waiter place the big mugs of beer in front of them. Sigurd slipped a coin to the man and grabbed his drink. The mug looked tiny in his fist as he raised it for a toast. Adelaise rolled her eyes again and took her cup. “To secrets.” Adelaise snorted. “To secrets. May they find the light.” “I can drink to this.” Sigurd gave a long pull on his beer. Bitter and cold. Perfect for a night of talking and learning. He motioned for another. “I think Sholeh can learn to trust me, but her secrets are the darkest. And I can’t figure out Kincaid. There is far more to that man than I can understand. It was enough to get me kicked out of the caravan, and I do not understand why Sholeh followed him.” “She likes him.” “Yes, I see that. But she’s different here. Always running from her past.” “We all run from our past.” Sigurd kept his gaze on her even as he finished another third of his beer. “Some run faster than others.” “Ok, sage of the north—” “Sage? What is this word? Like wizard? Bah.” “No, a thinker.” “Better. We listen to elders in the north. The ones that live long enough have many tales to share with the young warriors.” “Then you’ll have to tell me your tale.” “Another time. It is your turn to tell the tale of your visit to the Inner City. It is I who came to you.” Adelaise turned to her beverage and took a polite sip. Her nose crinkled at the bitter brew, but she plowed forward anyway with her drink. “I’m in a tough spot, Sigurd. Even here, I don’t feel safe.” “Ah, two warriors with blades. Good beer and good cause. No place safer than with someone to watch your back.” Adelaise gave in to her humor and gave him a chuckle. He could win her over. Maybe not tonight, but she’d see that his blade was genuine. Sigurd didn’t fight for money. All he needed was a cause, and this group might give it to him. “I’m not sure how I can explain it yet. I need to think some more.” “Ah, only hurts your head, yes. Sometimes action is all that is needed. Solve problems with blade or fist.” “Not all of them. There are many places of power in this city. Each one tries to destroy the other, but they invariably do it from the shadows. Their plans are always difficult and complicated. Some take years or more, but they always plan. And they never want war. Too expensive.” “Then, not a good place for warriors who live by their swords. We need a simple life, yes?” “Yes, life has been simple before. I look forward to the time when it can be simple again.” “Maybe with Kincaid and Sholeh, yes?” “I wish it was that easy. They make things very complicated for all of us, and too many people in the city are interested in them. The church, schools of magic, and others that I’m still trying to figure out. I’m afraid they will need our blades soon.” “Then we will use them.” Sigurd reached over a patted the long blade tucked in the corner of the booth. “You know there are fights that we can’t win.” She looked at him over the mug of ale. “We should only fight when we can. And when we fight, we only win.” The next round of beers arrived. “I will listen and wait for when you need my help, Adelaise. You are not alone in your fight.” They each took a sip of their beer and tried to figure each other out. The secrets were enough to give them thoughts for the rest of the night.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Visitors",
      "content": "Sholeh - Visitors She was losing him. Kincaid snored in his soft mattress. Sholeh didn’t remember when he came back into their room last night. He was unusually silent. As she watched his chest rise and fall in a slow, even rhythm, Sholeh felt the young man was different. The city was changing him. She didn’t want to wake him, but she moved closer to the magi. If she had to guess, he looked a shade older. She chewed the inside of her lip. If he was using magic, he’d age right before her eyes. Kincaid told her the story of what happened to Vedette Atros, and she felt those thoughts creep inside her heart. He couldn’t do this to himself. Carpentry was a creative art that had once drawn her to him. She loved the chest he’d built her in what seemed like decades ago. The exquisite wood leftover from scraps yielded to a master’s precision. She remembered when she took him to the forge and crafted the metalwork to finish the chest. The bands of steel were excellent work for the junior apprentice to share with her carpentry friend. They were at a different place in their lives then. A much closer place. That warmth flooded through Sholeh’s heart again, but she pushed it away as she returned to the present. Her friend was using magic again. But if not at the schools, then where? The Empire did not outlaw magic. They did not kill off wizards. Sholeh knew how authority worked in the city; everyone loved control in the centers of power. She remembered her father discussing the vote to increase funding for the schools of magic. Competing power was better than consolidation under one ambition. Her father. His own ambition drove him to the top. Whatever it took, he would do. Her mother pushed him as she craved to live in the rare air at the height of power. He’d made it, and Sholeh left. She promised she’d never come back. And yet, here she was. She could not abandon her friend in this cesspool of unbridled ambition. Kincaid had to find what he’s looking for here, even if it meant she had to hide from her old feelings with this place. Sholeh tucked in the sheets around the sleeping magi and wished he could find the rest to restore his spirit. That is what they needed to discover here. The stairs barely creaked as she headed to the main room. The fire crackled, and embers disappeared up the chimney. Wasps of smoke obscured the room, but not enough to hide any of the people gathered here. The room was alive with workers preparing for another day. The call to work would come soon enough from the bell towers around the city. She ate a quick bite with the smallest coins they had. She’d have to talk to Kincaid tonight about their funds. Adelaise had been generous with her earnings, but that account was limited. Sholeh worried how much lighter their purses were getting with each passing day. Sholeh followed the rest of the workers out the door into the brisk morning air as bells rang from the clock towers. Sholeh turned toward the rising terrain of the Inner City. The light bounced off the white walls and golden spires and rooftops. Once upon a time, she thought this city was exquisite and held unlimited promise for anyone. “Your father heard you were in town.” A pair of men in elegant white tunics over chainmail armor waited at the first crossroad. “I would hope so. I went to his church to let him know I was in town but not available.” “He would like you to visit him.” “He is too important to come down from his high mountain to visit the poor scum in the Outer City? Even his own daughter?” “That is not what he said.” “Then you should deliver the message of what I said.” One of the knights of the church relaxed his rigid posture and approached. The jingle of his armor and the rattle of his spurs intimidated workers in the street. With furtive glances, they parted to move away from the pair. “He would like to know what he can do to help you in Pilaetium.” “That’s not why I went to the church. I wanted to see what had changed. I found my answer.” “Then you should see him.” “I saw enough.” “He doesn’t want to make life hard for you, Sholeh.” “By all that is holy, I do not believe we are on a first-name basis. You can tell him…” The man removed his helm and pulled back his chain coif from around his face. Sholeh’s words trailed off in her mind as she looked at a younger version of her father. If he didn’t have a head of black hair and no wrinkles around his eyes, she would have turned and fled from the spot. But her feet were frozen. “Sholeh, we could be on a first-name basis. Our father found a place for his son in the knights of the church.” “Our father?” The man smiled with the same condescending smirk her father showed his subordinates. Sholeh recoiled. It was too much like her father. “Yes, the patriarch is also my father. From before you were born. Before your mother came into his life.” “You mean his wife?” The man glanced around the emptying square. The other knight took up an alert stance. “Keep your voice down, Sholeh.” The command was stern but low. “Why, because I might embarrass the great patriarch with his indiscretion?” The knight clenched his mouth and clutched the pommel of his sword. He definitely had a different relationship with the patriarch than the one Sholeh left. “Enough, Sholeh. We came to invite you back to the church.” “To the church or to see my father?” “They are the same.” Sholeh shook her head. “That has been the problem all along. Patriarch might mean father, but he was never the father I needed. And when I left, my father did not look for me.” The knights wisely stayed silent as they considered her challenge. Her half-brother stepped back and gave her a half bow. Sholeh stared at him and didn’t back down. “I will give your father your message.” “I didn’t get your name.” “Kian.” “Kian, I hope we do not meet again.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Dark Choices",
      "content": "Kincaid - Dark Choices Sunlight trickled through the windows and poked through the drifting dust in the air. The rays pushed the particles across Kincaid’s vision. The day was already well underway, and Sholeh’s bed was neatly made. Kincaid wished away the longing in his heart. After all the challenges and the time in the caravan, he missed her. In the darkest moments of his life, she had been a light in his terrible journey. Her moods were now darker, and guilt choked him up as he reflected on his focus on his magi training. A gentle rap on the door broke him from his distant thoughts. “Yeah.” The door creaked open. “Decent?” Kincaid gave a laugh. “All the time together, and you still wonder if I am decent?” Sholeh walked in, and Kincaid’s smile dropped to concern. Her face was a storm of emotions. She had never been good at hiding her inner feelings, but now she wasn’t even trying. She collapsed on her neat bed without addressing his humor. Sholeh tore off each boot and threw them against the opposite wall with a thud. Still not satisfied, she flopped backward on her bed. “Breakfast couldn’t have been that bad.” Sholeh threw an arm over her eyes and covered her face for a moment. Kincaid watched the rise and fall of her chest. Even in her anger, she was beautiful. “Ok, so not breakfast. But breakfast company? Sigurd usually doesn’t make you feel like this.” She shook her head, but the words wouldn’t come. “Well, if it’s not Sigurd or Adelaise, I’m not sure how to help.” Sholeh pulled her arm away from her face and banged it back down on the mattress. “This town is dangerous for me, Kincaid.” Kincaid got up out of bed and pulled on his pants and shirt from his pack. He sat down on the bed next to Sholeh’s lying body, and he slipped his hand in hers. “We’ve fought wizards, challenged ruling houses, dueled nobles, and escaped from terror. We can fight whatever is here, Sholeh. You know I will do anything for you.” “We are so distant, Kincaid.” “I was thinking the same thing this morning, and that’s my fault—” “No. This city does too many things to me. So many things happened here in my past, and I would like to keep them hidden. But someone keeps digging them back up.” “Who’s doing the digging?” Sholeh turned her face away from him. “I’m putting you in danger, Kincaid. If the church finds out how close I am to you, they will use you against me.” “I’m not a member of your church. Or any church, for that matter. They’d have to work pretty hard to make that happen. Why would they want to hurt you?” “They do not wish to hurt me. They wish to bring me back.” “What about the blacksmiths?” “That is over. I will not be able to return in this city. Perhaps the Empire.” “What did you do?” Kincaid whispered those words even as he wondered if she would answer them. “I left.” “I figured as much. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have met in Caesea.” “I left after one of the blacksmiths pursued me for more than my skills.” Kincaid’s throat clenched on his next words. She never told him about her past in the city. “And?” “My father hated him. He made the smith’s life miserable, and his family suffered because of the attention he gave me.” “What did he do?” “I fled before anything serious could happen. I promised to never return to Pilaetium.” “And I brought you back here…” “I thought that time could heal old wounds. They cannot. The scars are intense, and some wounds can’t be healed. Now I am worried about you, my friend.” She turned her head and looked him in the eyes as pools of water formed in the corner of her deep brown eyes. Her black hair laid around her face. “We shouldn’t worry, Sholeh. I want to tell you about the magic I’ve found.” Sholeh sat up next to him and used the edge of her sleeve to soak up the tears before they fell down her face. She swung her legs around and leaned her head on Kincaid’s shoulder. “I thought the schools rejected you. I thought we would be done here.” “There is a group of students who study magic differently. The hecaerae have many factions here. They make the sorceratti look childish in the way they approach magic.” “The schools of magic have been strong in Pilaetium before the sorceratti emerged in Caesea. And even before Magi Cormac made his way from the Northern States.” “They have so much more knowledge of how magic works here. I can learn about my magic, Sholeh.” He couldn’t keep the excitement out of his voice. And Sholeh’s mood softened with his eager words. Kincaid loved to feel her melt as he talked about his dreams. “We can stay, Kincaid. But we must be careful.” “I found out so much about my magic here, Sholeh.” The rush of words continued despite Sholeh’s warning. Kincaid couldn’t help himself. “The way they master magic is different, and I found I can manipulate time. One of the students called me a chronomancer.” “What does that mean?” “I can change how fast or slow time moves around me. And the flow of magic is extraordinary. I can channel it differently.” Sholeh pulled her head off his shoulder and gazed into his eyes. “Kincaid, the magic is still affecting you. I can see it in your eyes, in your body, in your fatigue. The magic still takes your soul. Why must you do this?” “I’m at a different place, Sholeh. I can see and understand so much more of what magic can do for us. We can change the world.” “By all that is holy, for how long? A year? Two? Before your soul crumbles in your body, and you die?” Kincaid knew she was right. She was terribly right. His mind knew he could do so much more with magic. But his soul would bear the price of each experiment. He could transform the world until his body collapsed under the pressure. Then the realm would forget him. “But I know the secret of magic, the darkest secret.” “By all that is holy and good, Kincaid. You must not. I’ve seen the bodies you touch with that magic.” “But for the right reason—” “No. There is no reason for the darkness to walk the earth this way. Your soul will become darker than emptiness. You must not think this way. Every center of power will look for you and torture you to find the answers they seek.” “But then I can never use my magic. I will be a carpenter.” “That is an honorable trade. I remember the days we talk about our own shops and be masters of the trades. The wealth we would create with our hands and the joy we could bring so many. Probably not in Caesea, but somewhere we could choose.” “Magic changed everything.” “Only if you let it. You can still make the right choices.” Kincaid considered the wisdom of her words. In the years they had been together, she was the one who could tell him he was wrong. When she and his older sister, Liane, would gang up on him, he’d never win. His intellect was never enough to win an argument. Magic beckoned just out of reach, just beyond his consciousness. The seductive touch pulled a piece of his mind away from the moment. He imagined their lives in the inner city with a different school of magi. To challenge the hecaerae of Pilaetium. His magic. His time. He slipped his arm around Sholeh and squeezed her shoulders. She leaned her head back into him. Kincaid’s mind drifted to the challenge of his magic. Control of forces and common elements was within his grasp. Sholeh grounded him with her logic, but she didn’t understand what he could do.",

      "title": "Sigurd - Follow Up",
      "content": "Sigurd - Follow Up Sigurd gazed at the docks from the row of warehouses, and he filled his lungs with the smell of brine. Shouts echoed off the floating filth with swears only sailors would use. Life on the docks surged and ebbed with the water, the voices, and the smells. The sun made its descent behind the hills of Pilaetium, lighting fires to the opposite side of the straights. Empire fortifications dotted the bay across the straights. Signal fires winked and gestured to each other. Sunset’s beauty brought peace to the city but not to Sigurd’s heart. He’d have to walk into the warehouse behind him. The structure was wood with peeling paint and chipped timbers. The owners didn’t choose to keep up the structure, but it temporarily sheltered the items coming off the docked ships. This warehouse sheltered more. Buried within the depths was a collection of office spaces and meeting rooms. Different employers worked from the bowels of the building, shielded from the eyes of the law. A careful bribe here and there could keep the most interested customs official looking at the outer ring of the goods. Not looking further into the building was essential to their security. Sigurd recalled the first time he stepped off a ship with his weapons and his seabag. The city beckoned the young northerner with its wealth and opportunity. The underworld was more interested in his talent and his scruples. Sellswords in the Empire had to belong to the Guild. Sigurd never had the chance to demonstrate his prowess in arms before a different group pulled him in. A darker brotherhood acquired rare goods and pursued lucrative contracts. Someone had to perform jobs the Empire, the church, the magicians, and the guilds could deny. For the past few months, Sigurd was successful. In groups, he was the hired sword who could intimidate with a scowl. A draw of his long blade turned many encounters into a retreat for the opposing forces. He longed to use his bow, but an eight-foot longbow was too much to travel through the city. Tonight, he had to face his failure. Too many days had gone by, and he hadn’t found a chance to get back into the merchant’s house. They’d come looking for him soon. Success was the only standard, and those who failed on the contracts saw their life expectancy cut short. Sigurd unhooked his long blade from across his back and strapped it to his hip. If he needed the sword, he’d need a clean draw and get to work. Sigurd knew his dirk would be faster in the confines of the warehouse, but not more impressive. After loosening the weapons in their sheaths, he pushed open the side door to the warehouse. Sigurd held his hands to his sides, knowing the guards wouldn’t hesitate to pepper him with crossbow bolts if he made a sudden move. A voice came down from the rafters above him, “Proceed.” They could have killed him as he came in the door. They were under orders to let him pass. Boxes and crates lined efficient rows of marketable goods. At six feet tall, they made perfect obstacles for defense while allowing for an attack from above. These goods were also arrayed to disrupt a potential attacker. Sigurd moved through the maze at a steady pace. In the center of the building was a stone blockhouse. The masonry looked old, probably one of the first guardhouses for a much younger city. Too small for a customs house, Sigurd couldn’t figure out why anyone would build a warehouse around a house. But the cover was useful. A stout door protected the entrance to the inner chamber. Steel bands bound the wood, and steel studs deterred attackers. Arrow slits with sliding enclosures covered the advance to the door, and the defensive protections were open. Shadows flickered behind the slits as Sigurd approached. The clunk of a wooden crossbar echoed from inside. The door swung open. Instead of a pair of guards, Sigurd saw the man he hoped to see last. A short, stout man with rings on every finger grinned. Gold covered his chest in layers of necklaces, and his clothes were the most beautiful silk. He wore a thick black beard, and his brown eyes did not show mirth. “Sigurd, my friend, come, come. Yes, yes. So glad you decided to check in.” All lies. The young northerner ducked as he entered the blockhouse. Guards moved to flank him as he walked into the inner room. Lavish carpets layered the floor and made his boots squish with each step. Tapestries from the far south, paintings from the north, and silk from the east hung on every free surface. If they could figure out a way to put the valuables on the ceiling, Sigurd figured they would have already done it. “Sit, sit, my friend.” The stout man sat on cushions and leaned back against the wall. The guards accompanied them in the room, and Sigurd wasn’t pleased to see two other sentries also waiting. These men were giants. One was a northerner like Sigurd and rested his hands on the shaft of a double-bladed axe. Two looked like they were natives of the Empire, probably soldiers expelled from their legions. They favored the short stabbing swords but carried two of them, one for each hip. The last was from across the Inner Sea. He had swarthy features and three spears in his fist. These were not the odds Sigurd hoped for. Sigurd chose to stand. “If you will not sit, then a drink?” Eager hands poured from a silver flagon, and crystal red wine flowed into a golden cup encrusted with gold. The man had a strange way to show his wealth. Sigurd wasn’t impressed with the intimidation. “My friend, you should relax. We could have already killed you. Just talk, just talk.” Sigurd wondered if the four guards would share a few words. “The job did not go well.” “Yes, yes. I have heard this told throughout the markets. But much worse than not well.” Sigurd dropped his gaze to the plush carpets at his feet. “The chest was empty when I got into the room.” “You missed an important part. A crucial part. You broke down the door to the room and alerted the watch within the Inner City.” “This is true, yes.” Sigurd didn’t want to meet those eyes and drown in the venom. “I pay for discretion. I have many mouths to feed here, and I can’t afford the watch, the guard, and customs to be looking in my direction when a job goes bad. You threaten my entire family with your foolishness, my friend.” Sigurd shifted his eyes upwards. “I can try again, yes?” The man snorted. “What will you do, my friend? Fight your way into the merchant’s house. Find out he has already moved to a safe location? Tell me, tell me.” “Then I will make it up to you. I am putting together a team. People who can help.” “Yes, yes. I have heard of your blacksmith of the church. The carpenter who wants to be a wizard. The only one worth your time is the sellsword. She’s probably the only trustworthy one.” Sigurd couldn’t hide the surprise from his face. “Yes, yes. Your failure is very important to me. I wanted to make sure that you would not run when you failed. You’ve been watched, my friend. Watched carefully. All I did not know is when your sorry body would show up here.” “I am here, yes. And I can finish the job. With some work, I will find—” “What can no longer be found, yes? How will you do this?” “I can work—” “No. I think you must pay first.” The goons moved fast and tried to grab Sigurd by the shoulders. The northerner clutched one of the thugs from the Empire by the throat and gave a squeeze. With his muscles in motion, Sigurd threw the attacker against the side wall with a satisfying crunch. With that hand freed, he curled his fist and slammed it like a mallet into the next attacker. The blow pounded into flesh and gave him a deep grunt. As he raised his fist again, Sigurd’s breath exploded from his chest and left him gasping. The northerner slammed the haft of the axe into Sigurd’s stomach. Something cracked on the side of Sigurd’s head, spinning his face to the right. Blood filled his mouth with its iron taste. He couldn’t focus his eyes on the attack as another wooden blow rained down on his head. Through the ringing now in his ears, Sigurd heard, “Yes, yes. This price is good for the northerner for failure.” Blows rained down and kept Sigurd off balance. If he could focus, he’d fight back. He got a grip on an opponent. But the warriors didn’t give him a chance to regain his balance. The assault stopped, and Sigurd gasped for breath. Blood splatted on the expensive carpets. “Now, you will finish the job, Sigurd. Show them what it means to be a thief. Yes, yes. Or I will finish you. Now get him out of my sight.” Arms locked under Sigurd and carried him to the thick door. With a heave, they flung the young northerner into the warehouse. Sigurd pulled himself to his feet as his face burned from the blows. He’d make quite a sight at any bar tonight. Maybe someone would even buy him a free drink. Sigurd staggered out the exterior door. The cool sea breeze sent pins of pain across his bruised face and bleeding lip. He pulled himself up as his chest pulled and burned from the movement. One foot, one step. Sigurd straightened his posture as he moved away from the warehouse. “Quite a way to end a night, Sigurd.” He looked up at the woman in her loose red clothes. Sigurd smiled through his bloody teeth. “It only gets better from here, yes?” “Let me buy you a drink and get you cleaned up,” Adelaise said. Just what he needed.",

      "title": "Bartalan - Regrets",
      "content": "Bartalan - Regrets “You made a disastrous choice rejecting the magi.” The quill stopped scratching on the paper as the hecaerae looked up from his desk. He stoppered the ink bottle, laid aside his writing tool, and folded his hands in front of him. “Explain yourself.” Bartalan ignored the rumble of a gathering storm and pressed, “Yes, the man can summon magic.” “We know that, Bartalan. But not at this school.” “We should reconsider.” “And how do you draw this conclusion?” “I’ve talked to him.” An eyebrow went up as the scowl deepened. Students could speak to anyone in Pilaetium and, on occasion, even discussed magical theory with members of other schools. The goal of knowledge was to continue learning, even from some different sources. However, challenging a decision on this level was new terrain, even for Bartalan. “He made an emotional plea to enter the school, and we rejected him.” The most experienced hecaerae in the school folded his hands in front of him. Discussion over. “But there is more to his story.” Bartalan wrung his hands behind his back. “Theurgia rejected him before he came to us. We were his second choice.” Bartalan pressed with this fragment of information. “Is that why you rejected him? Because we were a second choice?” “Why are you questioning this decision, Bartalan?” The words were above a whisper now. Bartalan had to get to the point before the master stopped listening. “Because you wonder if I’m right.” The grand master’s face didn’t crack. Bartalan’s heart skipped a beat as he plunged dangerously close to insubordination. “I allowed this meeting because you are a promising student. Now I question what you have learned from our lessons.” “More than a student at the first rank. And that’s why I came to you instead of asking for a board to reconsider. You have knowledge and experience with so many students and interaction with other schools.” If the frontal attack wasn’t working. Bartalan tried an appeal to ego. The hecaerae walked the halls of power in the Empire, and only the patriarchs and the Emperor didn’t tremble. In the heart of their administration, the hecaerae could be unassailable. “What have you learned that would change my mind?” The master’s face still hadn’t moved, and his body position was rigid. “The immigrant, Kincaid, can learn how we teach magic. He can do more than use the raw power to destroy and attack. Instead, he can control the flow of power.” “And how would you know about this new method of control?” Bartalan worked his mouth, but the words stuck in his lungs. Ice formed in his veins and pumped to his legs. The Empire forbid the schools to teach magic outside of the confines of the curriculum. They made this agreement with the Emperor as citizens appeared with the ability to wield arcane might, and the peace had been stable for that time. The Empire expected the hecaerae to use magic in defense of the Empire, and the spring military campaigns would draft wizards to the cause. But if Bartalan admitted to experimenting with an immigrant, the disciplinary board would be the least of his worries. “I can sense the powers and the flow of magic.” His voice croaked as he choked on defeat. “You are one of the strongest students to walk the hall of Damis, Bartalan. Every instructor sees your potential. I don’t doubt you can sense the flows of magic, even at a distance.” The warning in the voice was clear and firm. He wouldn’t get another one. “Sir, if you could understand magic beyond what we study. If you knew we could learn more and advance our cause. Would you take it?” The elderly hecaerae sighed and placed his palms on the table. He used them for leverage to lift his body out of his comfortable seat. Bartalan sensed the subtle flow of magic to give the old man a touch of strength and add to his presence in the room. “There are many reasons why we control magic the way we do. In fact, there are reasons why Theurgia and Damis view magic differently. We teach the subjects and demonstrate the limits of magic in a different way. But for a reason. Magic is a force that can leap out of control and claim lives with an uncultured touch. The wizard’s life is always in the balance. Always. We all respect that. Do you?” Bartalan pushed his iron discipline to contact the arcane plane. The trickle of might flowed into his heart and filled his mind with power. He saw the deep glow around the master as surely as the master observed the ring of power around him. See. The old one is afraid of what you can do. Show him. The voice rattled inside Bartalan’s head and confused his purpose. No, he wouldn’t show the depths of his power. Magic pushed at his control and longed to surge into his soul. Bartalan fought and won against the flood from beyond his consciousness. “I do. The power feels infinite. Control must be absolute.” Especially with the voice in his head. “Then why must you press with the magi?” “Because I think he has knowledge we need. We didn’t give him to explain the differences in being a magi. I think that is a mistake.” “You know something, Bartalan. I know you do. But this conversation is already dangerous.” Magic flared at the edge of the grand master’s words. His control was tight and focused. “I am sorry, grand master. I wish to learn more, and I want to do it within the confines of the school. I thought we should invite him back.” “I will be blunt, Bartalan. The magi, Kincaid, is uncultured. Undisciplined. Dangerous. To all of us.” “I understand your position.” He teeters on the edge of age and fading into irrelevance. The force of magic is yours. Bartalan shook his head and drove the voice into a corner of his mind. With a push of his will, the magic closed off. He sensed the grand master did the same. “Bartalan, leave the magi alone. No good will come to you or your position if you continue on this dark road. We need you here at this school, and we want you to stay. Do not make us regret that decision.” Bartalan already regretted many of the decisions of the ruling body of the school. His list grew by the day for the offenses against his agenda. This was a significant mark Damis would one day answer. One day. Not today. He bowed from the waist to the grand master and waited for the old one to settle his weight back into the chair. The ancient hecaerae didn’t make the chair creek with his feather weight. As the quill came up, Bartalan pulled his body upright and left the room. Not today. Soon.",

      "title": "Kincaid - New Lessons",
      "content": "Kincaid - New Lessons “You have so much to teach us, Kincaid,” Darya said. “I don’t. You’ve spent years at school and practiced magic with someone to guide and teach you. I’ve been a wizard for a few months. And only because I was fighting for my life.” Kincaid and Darya walked through the streets in the afternoon. Their pace was slow, enjoying the journey rather than racing to the destination. Her nearby warmth distracted his thoughts even as he struggled with a sense of belonging with the covert group of students. They’d already taught him more than he expected, and Darya’s outreach warmed his lonely soul. “And that is an experience none of us have. Our schools provide magical force for the Empire. When the military starts its campaigns, the schools draft hecaerae to accompany the legions.” “Then you can learn those lessons from the returning wizards.” Darya’s brown eyes captured his attention as they softened. He could get lost in their gaze. “They don’t return. In my time at the school, I haven’t seen one come back to Pilaetium.” “The curse of magic.” Kincaid nodded his understanding. He watched a sorceratti destroy herself with her magic. If a wizard lost control over arcane power, it was fatal. “Not a curse, Kincaid. This isn’t something we can solve with a prayer and an offering to the church. The school has a class on the price of magic. The scrolls and books we read date back to the earliest researchers and practitioners of magic. It is just a fact. Like the sun comes up in the east and sets in the west. Beyond change.” Not beyond change, Kincaid thought. He could pay the price with other souls. If Sholeh were here, she’d remind him the price was the same. Someone paid. “Why tell me this?” “Because you aren’t a student at the school, and your thoughts are dark and heavy.” Kincaid glanced over at his companion. “One of your powers is to read minds?” Her smile was broad and genuine. Attractive even. “You’d feel it if I was channeling energy. You aren’t paying attention to everything we’re talking about.” “I just don’t understand what I can teach you.” Their pace took them through the emptying streets as the day came to a close. Servants relinquished their tasks and returned to their homes and families. Shadows claimed the roads in the clutches of gathering darkness, even as the street lights pushed back the relentless grip with globes of light. Kincaid and Darya stepped from light to dark with sure strides. “You know more because classes and lectures don’t bind your thinking. You only have practical knowledge of magic.” Darya looked up to him. Those eyes were wide open, drawing him in with her longing. Her words held the edge of regret. “But you showed me more than I could understand the first night. You have so much more power at your fingertips than even the most powerful sorceratti in Caesea.” “Do you think we could fight and win against the sorceratti of Caesea?” Kincaid took his eyes off his companion and focused on the paved roads of the capital. The roads were smooth except for the grooves wagons laden with goods left in their passing. Masons and stone cutters kept the city streets in good order, and the Empire was always about maintaining order. Magic against magic was chaos—power without bounds. Kincaid imagined the destruction of the Inner City if a few sorceratti fought against one of the schools. The elaborate stone structures and displays of wealth would be blasted chunks of rocks and drifting dust. Arcane power ignored wealth. “There is no winning with a fight among wizards. Only destruction.” He whispered his words, already convinced of their truth. The evening breeze off the straights took the words away. Darya pressed in close to his chest. “See, you’ve already taught me more than we knew.” The gathering of students was small this evening. Only four this night, although Bartalan was one of them. His set jaw and rigid stance gave away his emotions. Kincaid didn’t want to cross him tonight. But those eyes followed his every move. The students helped themselves to pitchers of wine and relaxed for a few moments. It reminded Kincaid of an enjoyable evening meal with Sholeh, Adelaise, and Sigurd. But this group was distinct. They were like him and accepted the magic he could use without question. None judged him for what he could do. “Kincaid told me about fights among wizards,” Darya said. “Oh, please do tell, magi.” Bartalan would be argumentative tonight. Kincaid glanced at the others and saw their displeasure with their fellow student’s attitude. Accepting his fate, Kincaid resigned himself to confrontation. At least Darya was here. “I only mentioned that there are no winners in a fight with wizards. Only destruction.” “And yet, by your tales, you stand among us. Victor over numerous wizards.” The gaze melted Kincaid’s resolve, right where he stood. “You’ve certainly heard the stories of Caesea’s destruction. The fight destroyed houses, shops, and an entire block.” Kincaid’s fists curled to iron grips as his words spat from the corner of his mouth. Destruction and death raged in his mind. He pushed them aside. “Destruction, indeed. And the magi emerged from the rubble.” “What do you want, Bartalan?” The others in the room recoiled from the men facing off against each other. If either drew magic now, they’d find out exactly what happened when wizards collided. Magic hungered for a touch. From any of them. “I want the real story. The truth. No wizard can walk into Pilaetium claiming that they defeated other wizards.” “I don’t care if you believe me.” “But I do, magi. I do indeed. The stories of your destruction made their way to the city, and we’ll keep hearing about it for some time. In fact, I expect the Emperor to reach out to Damis and Theurgia for an inquiry. If a fight of wizards can do so much damage in Caesea, what would happen in Pilaetium? Or any other part of the Empire.” The other students held their breath and glanced toward each other. As the reports filtered their way through the bureaucracy, the Emperor would learn what happened in Caesea. And then the intelligence services would find out what the red-haired immigrant knew. He was in their midst. “That isn’t why I’m here.” “You want to learn more about magic. Got it. The schools turned you away because you are beyond what they can handle. The powers of the Empire won’t allow it.” “That’s not fair, Bartalan,” Darya said. Bartalan silenced her with a look. The others in the room didn’t matter. “They’ll find you in the slums, Kincaid.” “Then teach me, Bartalan. Teach me what I asked to know.” “But you know more than all of us, magi.” “What are you are talking about?” Bartalan looked toward the students staring at the standoff between the pair of wizards. He brought his gaze back to Kincaid and took a step forward. The young magi reached out with his mind and crafted his willpower to clutch magic from the arcane plane. Magic jumped to his call and rushed into the open channel into Kincaid’s soul. With the power already begging for release, he plied the twist on magic. The images around the room barely changed. Each student stood motionless and observed the magic energy humming between them. In only a moment, Bartalan would be flush with his source of power. But he wouldn’t move closer. Bartalan’s grasp for power flooded Kincaid’s senses. He carried the same touch of control on magic and didn’t create a defensive shield or draw enough power for an attack. Kincaid closed off his flow and didn’t move. “As you can see, you already know more than I do. I only used magic the way you taught me on my last visit. I still want to learn more.” Fatigue crippled Kincaid’s body. He wanted to sit and let his eyes close even as his body ached. Sholeh would know he was practicing magic. Bartalan returned to his seat and lowered his body into one of the chairs. He didn’t take his eyes off Kincaid as he walked over to a couch and slumped into the cushioned embrace. The air in the room warmed as the other students relaxed. None of them wanted to talk about magic now. Instead, they discussed plans for the future, new opportunities within the school, and favorite teachers. To Kincaid, these must be the topics wealthy students discussed in their elite schools. He had nothing to add to the discussion. If he continued this trend of exploration with his power, he needed them to share more than school gossip. He could never share his darkest secret of magic with them.",

      "content": "Kincaid - Next Steps “She worries about you.” Kincaid jumped and spun toward the alley’s shadows. Magic clawed across the mental gap between arcane and physical, begging for access. He ignored the arcane fingers reaching for his soul. It would be there if he needed it, but he couldn’t handle more burdens tonight. He picked out Adelaise as she emerged from pools of darkness. The weapons at her hips were giveaways for the former mercenary captain. She didn’t move closer after Kincaid recognized who it was. But Adelaise’s eyes focused on Kincaid’s companion. Darya twisted her hands and looked away under the scrutiny. Kincaid’s heart leaped in his chest, enough to make his cheeks red. Darya didn’t deserve to be treated like this. Adelaise couldn’t judge him. “I know she does. I’ve known it for a long time.” “Kincaid, maybe I should—” “No, hold on. Adelaise, what do you want?” “Only to talk. I’m not sure what else she wants, though.” The accusation hit like a crossbow bolt. Darya’s flushed to a deep red face, and her eyes fixated on the ground. “Kincaid, I’ll see you later on.” She held up her hand to cut off another protest. Kincaid knew she was right this time. He had to deal with this line of questioning without her around. “I’ll let you know when we have the next meeting set up. Ok? Bye.” The young magi watched the Damithian hecaerae walk away even as he realized he didn’t know where she lived within the city. His gaze lingered before he turned back to Adelaise. “What do you see in her?” Adelaise stood with her feet apart and arms crossed across her chest. She raised her right eyebrow as she waited. “Someone I can’t be. Someone I won’t be.” “Interesting answer. Let’s go for a walk.” Adelaise came up to him and placed her hand on Kincaid’s elbow for a nudge. “We can’t talk around here.” No point in resisting. It can only get worse, Kincaid thought. Adelaise led him away from the student house, and as he matched her stride, she released his elbow and walked by his side. “Besides, we can’t afford food around here. Had anything to eat today?” “Not much.” “Your rich friends didn’t spare you a coin or buy you dinner? Shame.” “What do you know about my friends?” “Only what I saw after I followed you here. Seems the men around me get in trouble frequently. Not unlike being a mercenary captain.” “You followed me? Why?” Kincaid stopped. The pair of guards operating the small door at the gate to the Middle City watched with amusement as the young man and woman tried not to raise their voices. “Not here.” She glanced toward the sentries at the gate. “Why not here? You’ll follow me anywhere else.” “Check your emotions. This isn’t the place. Don’t make me drag you out of here.” “You couldn’t,” Kincaid muttered those words under his breath. She really couldn’t. One surge of magic and she’d regret this confrontation for life. But then what? Kill one of his only allies? Instead, he followed her through the door and gave the guards a knowing smile. They chuckled and gestured for him to follow. They kept their pace up through the Middle City. Kincaid’s mind was flush with emotion, and he ignored the sights of the wealth. The awkwardness of following Adelaise grew as she didn’t offer more conversation or reveal their destination. Exhaustion clutched Kincaid’s bones and weighted his legs with the burden of his conscience. The lack of food and brisk march through the city didn’t help. Adelaise proved her point, and the further away he moved from the wizards, his mind cleared of the conflicting emotions pumping through his heart. By the Outer City, their pace slowed. Adelaise was alert as she took in the crowds milling around the streets and hanging near bars and inns. Finding the one she was interested in, they stepped onto the wooden porch. Kincaid glanced at the sign of the inn, The Wooden Cudgel. Strange name for a traveler’s inn in the Outer City. The patrons were quiet, focused on the conversations with the members of their tables. No booths graced the walls in this place. Servers worked the floor with the committed purpose to keep plates and mugs full, and unlike many bars in the Outer City, the patrons left them alone to do their work. “Adelaise, the wayward mercenary, she comes home to us.” The barkeep greeted them from behind her station and the stained bar. The woman wore a patch, a no-kidding patch, over one eye, as a white puckered scar ran from her hairline to her jaw. The wound crippled the half-smile. She moved a pair of mugs with a single hand, moving fluidly without having a left hand. “Beautiful as ever, Gechina.” Adelaise’s tone was light and cheery. She went over to the bar, stood on her tiptoes, and hugged the barkeep. “We should talk, Adelaise.” Adelaise nodded as she scooped up the drinks from the table. “And don’t you think you stroll back into town and start a tab here. Who’s the redhead?” “A friend. Needs some mentoring.” Gechina looked Kincaid up and down. “Sure he’s worth it?” Adelaise gave a theatric sigh and glanced his way. “Think so. He cost me my captaincy. I hope my decision was right all along with him.” Kincaid winced and tried a disarming smile to the women examining him. Adelaise had control over his next meal, and he owed her his entire livelihood. They looked through the bar to find an empty table. Without hesitation, Adelaise walked across the room and sat down. She motioned for Kincaid to follow. “I needed to talk in a place where I can trust people.” “Even after you lost your captaincy? You’re on probation.” “People here don’t worry about rank, Kincaid. They don’t care about position. Every one of them remembers how someone else fought at their side and gave a sacrifice. Look at Gechina. One of the finest fighters in the Empire, and an immigrant at that. She can still tear you to pieces with a blade in her right hand. She was my first captain.” Kincaid nodded. The beer here was at the standard of the Inner City. Strong, clear, and the perfect level of bitterness. But she charged the prices of the Outer City. A good place indeed. Adelaise gestured around the room and continued. “Different than your little house in the Inner City.” “Why does that bother you?” “It should bother you.” “Why?” “Because Sholeh worries about you every day. She’s struggling to figure out what day labor job she can find to support you. Before long, she’ll attempt to work at a forge, and that will get her exiled. Sigurd is getting into trouble in the town, and I’m trying to figure out how we finish paying the bills. We can’t live in Pilaetium for free.” She stabbed with her finger to punctuated each sentence. Kincaid shrunk smaller in his seat with each blow. Every word was correct. “What’s going on?” Kincaid decided to trust her. “We came to the Empire for the schools of magic.” “I got that much. We spent a lot of time together on the caravan, and I understand your passion.” “Both rejected me.” The sting still hurt as the words tumbled out of his mouth. “So, what’s with the house?” “There are students who explore where schools don’t teach. Instead of academics, they push the edge of their powers.” Adelaise put her mug on the table and released the handle from her clutches. Her lips clenched into a thin line. “You killed Xenres’ man with magic.” “No, not with magic. But when the four attacked me, I used what I had. Magic kept me alive.” “You’re here because you are a wizard.” Kincaid nodded and took a drink. “You trust the people around here?” “With my life, Kincaid. And magic isn’t illegal in Pilaetium. Just unwise. What are they teaching you?” “I’ve only been able to use magic for a few months. The power available to me is incredible. The destruction of the city…” He watched her expression return to disbelief and then transition to awe. “Guess I didn’t need to hire a company, only you.” “And Sholeh. We both needed to leave.” “Fair. But if this group is spending so much time exploring magic, why bring you into their circle of trust?” “I don’t think they trust me. Well, their leader certainly doesn’t.” “Do you trust him?” “No.” Kincaid shook his head. “They have years of training with these experienced tutors. I’m an inexperienced hack.” “Destroying a city isn’t an accident. You have incredible power, Kincaid. But they have your interests at heart? Keeping you off the wrong path?” “I don’t know. But I do know I don’t have any other choices. How’s Sholeh?” “You should ask her.” Kincaid dropped his head toward his mug. He knew he should. He’d be dead months ago if she hadn’t helped him. “She’s fine, Kincaid. Just worried about you. Concerned for the future, like the rest of us. And you aren’t talking.” “I understand, Adelaise. I’ve got to do a better job with this, but the wizards…” “Offer everything you want. Fill the hole inside of you. I felt the same way when I practiced with a sword. The blade became part of me, and when I began with my first company, I discovered my place in the world.” She looked down at the half-empty mug. “Well, I did.” Kincaid finished his beer and pushed the mug to the center of the table. Before he could start his next sentence, a server scooped up the empty and replaced it with a full one. Adelaise smiled at him. “One of the perks of this bar. No patron goes thirsty. Don’t worry; we can afford this one.” “Looks like I’ve got some work to do to clear this up.” “You do. But what are you going to do with the wizards?” “The hecaerae? I must continue somewhere. We came to Pilaetium for me to explore my magic, and this might be my only chance.” “Be careful, Kincaid. Let us know when you have these meetings so we can be ready.” “Ready for what?” “I don’t trust what’s going on in this city. Too many people are playing games with their positions. It’s easy to get caught up in the webs of power. Your friends are more than they seem.” “I don’t doubt that. All wizards are more than what they seem. But I need them, for now. And I have to figure out a way to make our ends meet with bills. We’re all out of jobs and removed from our guilds. But this is the one thing we came to do.” Adelaise leaned back in her chair. Kincaid couldn’t read her face this time.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Torn",
      "content": "Adelaise - Torn Kincaid’s information placed the pieces of the puzzle together. From the caravan to Sholeh’s protection, this made sense. She watched as Kincaid picked his way through the stragglers still at the bar. He was steady on his feet, and Adelaise had no concerns he’d make his way back to their inn. The young man had the light step of a clean conscience. Adelaise carried a heavy burden on her soul. She twisted the mug on the surface of the table and traced her fingers on the water rings. The fire in the middle of the inn burned to glowing embers. Adelaise couldn’t let go. “Must be one of those tough decisions.” Adelaise chuckled and gestured for the owner, Gechina, to sit down at the table. Gechina took one look around the bar and made sure the remaining patrons were set, and she settled her weight into the seat. “If I had to guess, your honor is conflicting with your contract. You’re a rare captain that still behaves honorably.” “Former captain. Feelings make this more complicated.” She pulled her mug onto her lap and leaned back from the table. Her sigh was louder than she intended. “People trust us to get things done.” “That’s why you are one of the best, Adelaise. You go forward to do the right thing, even if it stinks to the high heavens.” “Then why is every choice the lesser of the evils? Why don’t I get the easy choices among the pleasant courses of action?” Gechina fixed her single eye on the ex-mercenary captain and leaned into the table. “Because you are the best there is. People who can make easy decisions are everywhere. The ones who can pick through the toughest jobs to find success in the land of the impossible… well, I only know one of those.” “Command is easier when you are on the field of battle. The consequences are there in front of you. Steel drawn, skill on skill, the flames of combat. Live or die. Fates have it all.” “But that’s not where the battle is won or lost, Adelaise. You know that better than anyone. Training, leadership, and command climate decide battles. Victory goes to the leader who pits their strengths against the opponent’s weakness.” “I wish this was a battle.” “I think it’s one for your soul.” Adelaise returned the gaze and placed the empty mug back on the table. “It is, and the cost will be high. No matter which way I pick.” “You remember what I told you: the more important the decision, the more time you should take to get it right.” “But what if there is no right, Gechina? What if there are only wrong decisions and bad consequences?” “That doesn’t change the importance of your decision. But the agony you are carrying tonight, this is important. No doubt in my mind. So take your time, and don’t mess this one up.” “Thank you, Gechina.” “Don’t forget to pay your tab on the way out.” Adelaise took back to the streets and let the night air embrace her feelings. Not nearly as frigid as the mountains, but enough to shock her mind into an alert state. She watched a hungry dog pick its way through trash in the alley. As she approached, a low growl rumbled from its belly. No teeth, just a warning. She mused if she was now only the piles of trash for the powerful to pick through—stupid analogy. Sigurd sat outside the entrance of their inn. He leaned back on two legs of the chair and rested his head against the inn's wooden wall. He looked peaceful, despite his terrifying injuries, as he laid his hands in his lap. And yet, without that heavy blade nearby, he also looked vulnerable. “Interesting place to perch, Sigurd.” “Good place to clear a bashed head, yes?” Adelaise gave him a chuckle. They weren’t always so different. “Got room for another?” The northerner motioned to the empty wall next to him and smiled, still keeping his eyes closed. “Kincaid came back earlier. Rough night?” “Only in my mind.” “Worst kind, then. The others you can meet with fist and blade.” “Didn’t work out so well for you. By the looks of it, you caught a lot more fists than you delivered.” “Will be different next time. Be a better thief, and they’ll be more bodies.” “A next time, huh? I thought you’d be done with those thugs.” “You should not ask questions on this.” “If you need my blade, you know where to ask. Genuine offer.” Her rear end was cold sitting on the pavement, and she got back up to her feet. Sigurd opened his eyes, even the swollen one, to watch her. “If you need my blade, you have it.” Adelaise nodded her thanks. “What do we do with the others?” Sigurd looked at her with those icy blue eyes. “That is your question. What do you plan for the others?” “I wish I had a good answer.” “Then perhaps we should drink on it. Many good answers have been found at the bottom of a mug, yes?” The chair creaked its relaxation as Sigurd raised his muscular frame from its grip. “Good thought, but not tonight. I want my head to be clear as I work through this. You should tell the others about the challenges you have and why you got beat up.” Sigurd snorted. “After you tell them why you are in trouble.” Adelaise craned her neck around and looked up at him. Every time she thought she had the young man figured out, he surprised her with his complexity. Far more attentive than he seemed. The stairs creaked as Sigurd climbed up to his room. He closed the door and fitted the latch into its place. The inn returned to silence with muffled sounds of slumber filtering through the upper floor's thin doors. A few fitful bodies slept near the fire in the common room, and Adelaise envied them. She walked back out into the darkness. The night watch paid a single traveler little heed, even with a pair of weapons at her hips. She tried to use different gates with each trip so people wouldn’t recognize a pattern or the guards reporting her actions for a few extra coins. Adelaise wondered when she had become so paranoid. A pair of fighters on opposite sides of steel had been her passion as a child. The ring of fine blades and the skill of the action were enough to get her heart pounding. She remembered her father showing her the strength of the most towering warriors deflected by the expertise of a blademaster. Now she was walking into an elegant inn in the middle of a night to see a spymaster. To tear her soul to shreds. For the family she left behind and still loved deeply. Adelaise thrust her soul into the safest place in her mind. She wouldn’t let him get at it, and she’d do her duty. Whatever that was. The inn looked the same in the small hours of the night. The lighting remained the same, and the quiet conversations continued in private rooms muffled with beautiful tapestries and carpets. The subservient staff helped her with her cloak and guided her to the room. The same room she’d been visiting. Adelaise hadn’t considered spies needed a command center, but this spy used the inn as his headquarters. Many of the staff had to be on his payroll. The curtain fell back into place behind her, and Adelaise watched the man work. Papers with text and figures covered the table. A quill worked quickly with frequent jabbing motions into the bottle of ink. She waited for the greasy man to finish his task and look up. “Late visit from my favorite exiled mercenary. You must have something significant for me. Something to add to my report, perhaps?” “Perhaps.” The spy adjusted his stack of paper and made room for the oil lamp in the center of the table. He peered from behind the glowing flame and looked over his wireframe glasses. She’d never seen him with reading glasses before, and it fit his image. “I do not pay you by the hour. Out with it.” “You asked me to find out more about the young man.” “I remember what I contracted you to do.” He threw the quill to the side and leaning back in the booth. “So, I did. I think you were looking for the wrong person before, the blacksmith.” “No, I am quite certain we wanted the blacksmith here. Her father has been looking for her for some time, and he was very interested in her return. The boy appears to be a benefit to the contract. Something else I can use.” “The boy is a wizard.” “So? We have schools of wizards. They are dangerous to some but harmless within the city.” “The schools rejected the boy, but he’s learning more about magic than anyone understands. With a group of students learning outside of the schools.” “More interesting. An unaligned wizard working with an unauthorized group of wizards. Now we have something to report. Something to work with on this one.” “Then, my contract is done. I want my payment. In full.” “Ah, the mercenary makes demands again. Always my favorite part of our negotiations, Adelaise. You think you come in here with a superior position, but you end up on your knees, groveling your way out. I still have what you want.” “Which is why I continue to work on your contracts. It’s time for me to head back into the world. Out of the Empire.” “But you are my doer, Adelaise. I have many people who want to tell stories and pretend they have secrets. I have very few people who actually do the work around the city. You are one of those. And clearly, my favorite.” “I’m not interested in this work.” “That’s quite irrelevant. The moment you surrendered leverage for a temporary advantage, your interests didn’t matter. I know exactly where your interests now are. We should keep them in alignment.” Adelaise hated coming here. He was a scoundrel and a thief. A liar and a man with no honor. But powerful and dangerous. “I need to know more, Adelaise. My main employer will be very interested to know more about the young man and his secret group. This is something my employer could use to his advantage against his opponents.” Adelaise stared at him with this new request. She smoldered under his gaze but restrained herself. One day she wouldn’t suppress her murderous urges, and she’d carve that smirk off his face. “Run along now.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Dark Choices",
      "content": "Kincaid - Dark Choices The next few days passed quickly for Sholeh and Kincaid. They agreed to come off the generosity of the warriors of their group and earn their keep. That was the easy part of the arrangement. The next part was finding work to pay a day’s wage. They found it with the stonemasons. Both were familiar with a day’s labor, and the callouses from their daily struggles with tools still reminded them of their hard-earned skills. More importantly, both discovered they had an aptitude for working with stone. Granted, their work was simple, sizing stones for the wall that would continue to grow. But the hammer and chisel work kept their minds occupied and their bodies busy. And the site manager paid daily. They’d have something to offer their small group. Falling asleep with burning shoulders and aching back wasn’t enough to deter Kincaid’s continued interest in magic. They were young and capable. The only reason to stay in Pilaetium was to allow Kincaid to explore magic with the students. The schools of magic slipped into the crevice of every dream as his soul hungered for the touch of magic. The students knew enough to make him better and teach him to control the power at his fingertips. He wished Sholeh could understand the burn within his heart. Kincaid knew the passion for arcane power could only be quenched with the fountain of knowledge. And she’d worry about him and his involvement with those students. Damithians and Thuergians invaded his quiet thoughts. He’d love to call them friends or even compatriots, but Bartalan always entered his mind. The image of academic partners fell in the flames of resentment from that one man. He’d have to reconcile his suspicion even as he lied about the dark secret he carried. That one secret kept him away from the group. Fatigue settled in his bones after each session. He could learn incredible powers, but he paid for it each day. He traded his life and his soul with each moment of magic. And his mind fought with the knowledge of how much they knew. They could share it with him, and he could explore. Sholeh breathed with the somber rest of the exhausted. Her face was peaceful with the rise and fall of her chest. She sacrificed everything to be with him. The minute she agreed to help him after his prison escape, she committed to him on the deepest level. Adelaise had done the same. With his banishment, she’d given up her captaincy and her guild. She hadn’t mentioned that sacrifice once in their time in Pilaetium. He owed them both for their sacrifices. They could leave this city after raising a few funds. But they stayed for him. The temptations of limitless arcane power grew stronger each day. He could learn from these students and embrace the nuances of magic. But his soul was limited. He couldn’t sacrifice everything just to learn. Which was why he laid awake in bed. He had the power to claim the souls of wizards. One willingly gave his spirit to fuel Kincaid’s strength, and the others surrendered with a fight. How could he tear a soul from a wizard in Pilaetium? Grab a student and show them how it’s done? He could leave a trail of corpses around the room. Start with Bartalan, maybe. His conscience recoiled at the thought of stealing lives to make his better. But the greater good awaited. If he could control this magic and do noble things for the people of the world, this could be worth it all. Sacrifices… No. Kincaid couldn’t think about taking on these wizards. And when they launched an investigation, his friends would be the first to bear the consequences of his actions. And with the wealth involved in those schools, he’d face personal vendettas and blood debts. The role of the hecaerae in the city was still uncertain. Adelaise tried to explain the centers of power within the capital and the Empire. Still, Kincaid didn’t see the manipulation of city affairs like in Caesea. In fact, he was surprised by how little the ruling class interfered in the Outer City. They’d been able to work and find jobs without the direct involvement of ruling families. The ruling families and their sorceratti. The sorceratti, the youngest member of the family. Kincaid sat up in bed for a moment and peered into the darkness. Sholeh didn’t stir. How could the youngest be trained as the sorceratti of the ruling houses? How would a family know when their youngest would be born? And how could they guarantee the youngest could have abilities with magic? Unless the ability to use magic wasn’t related to birth. Kincaid wished he could ask Magi Cormac so many more questions. They only had enough time to teach him to survive with his newfound powers. His short-lived mentor didn’t have time to explain how he came to understand arcane power or how he trained the city's sorceratti. If only he could tell more, he wouldn’t need this city and this school. But if the sorceratti could be trained, then the potential to use magic wasn’t innate. Could he tap into the power of the soul from others? Darkness washed over him. Unlimited power could be at his grasp in a city of this size. He didn’t know if his idea would work. Could he find others who were attuned to magic and learn more about the formation of magical powers? He’d then be strong enough to ignore the schools their students. There are limits to what the students knew and be willing to share. Kincaid pulled on his clothes as quietly as he could. He only froze once when Sholeh rolled over to her side. The day’s work was exhausting, and she didn’t stir when he closed the door behind him. The main room was silent except for the sleeping figures curled near the fading fire. Kincaid pulled up his cloak around his head as he walked into the cold night. The docks. Kincaid could find what he needed amongst the people of the docks. The young magi had no hopes of learning anything tonight in the Inner City, and the masters of the crafts in the Middle City would be sound asleep with dreams of the next day’s work. He’d find the nightlife and opportunity near the docks. Sounds of evening laughter danced with the tempo of the lapping waves. There’d be sailors missing muster at the morning tide. Crews and teamsters shared the camaraderie of alcohol and lived life to the limit. Kincaid moved toward the loudest bar but decided against going inside. The fewer people who saw him around this bar, the better. Magic clawed at his consciousness for recognition. Soon enough. He closed down those thoughts and focused on his task. He slipped to the alley and kicked aside the trash near his boots. The cold air flowed from the water and seeped into the lane. Kincaid wondered if he would find anyone outside sleeping off the effects of their revels or braving the colder temperatures. He worked his way behind the bar and crouched when he heard the back door slam open. The hinges groaned in resistance as they brought the door to the closed position. The rumble of a low voice filled the alley even as boots scraped in an irregular pattern across the ground. Kincaid hesitated for a moment to see if anyone would follow from inside the bar. Finding no one waiting for the traveler, Kincaid stood up from his crouch and gathered his cloak around him. He moved forward and stayed with the shadows. The magi brought magic to his soul. The surge through his body heightened his senses and allowed him to see the man in the deepest shadows. He stumbled from wall to wall and cursed each uneven step. Kincaid closed the gap before his target emerged from the alley. He placed a hand on his shoulder to steady the drunkard. The sailor tried to turn his head toward the newcomer but only lost his balance as his feet crossed. The smell of alcohol and urine nearly overpowered Kincaid as he rested the man against the wall. “Can you understand me?” “Whadda want?” “To talk for a moment. Do you see the light of the stars above?” The man flung his head backward to look upwards. “Yah.” “Reach out with your mind to them, bring them close to you.” The man raised a shaky hand from the filth of the alley and pointed to the stars. He tried to close an eye to improve his aim, but his arm collapsed back to his side. “Nope.” The magic in Kincaid’s soul howled in frustration. The surging power begged for release, but Kincaid checked its influence in his mind. His mind had to be clear to see how this could work. His heart raced each moment he couldn’t reach his goal, and the threat of discovery increased. Kincaid reached out and placed his hand on the man’s neck. “Then reach with me.” Magic surged through his fingertips and made the man’s neck glow with the arcane contact. The sailor looked upwards again to the stars with clearer vision. He saw everything displayed in a new light, and he turned to look back at Kincaid. The magi felt the slight push of magic from the man as he considered the world beyond himself. The man’s mind opened up and struggled with the effects of the drinking. Kincaid pulled the magic through the man. The power surged and raged within Kincaid, and he couldn’t hold back his laughter. The magi threw his head backward and howled at the stars. He gripped the man’s face with both hands. In a moment, it was over. The drunkard fell to his side in the trash and filth of the alley. He would never draw another breath; he ceased to exist. Kincaid stood up with new energy in his step. He tested his magic for a moment and used the stolen soul to fuel his efforts. Another soul powered Kincaid’s magic. He took three steps away, and the magnitude of what he’d done crashed through the powers of magic raging inside. The magic disappeared in a flash, and the weight of the murder crushed his soul. Kincaid leaned over and threw up his dinner onto the ground, and his eyes flooded with tears. He heaved until his stomach was empty. What had he done?",

      "content": "Sholeh - A Father's Choice “Damn him.” Sholeh threw on her clothes and didn’t look back at the empty cot. Life was hard, cutting stone every day, but Kincaid was returning his old self from Caesea. Until this morning without Kincaid getting ready with her. She thrust aside her emotions and pulled on her boots. Damn him indeed. Sholeh wouldn’t have time for food before heading to the backbreaking work ahead of her. She swore she wouldn’t look back at that cot. The line of day workers waited at the entrance to the stone pit. A pair of hired thugs kept things orderly as the masters looked over the individuals and pulled them out of line. One recognized Sholeh and brought her to the pay table. “Where’s your partner?” “By all that is holy, I wish I knew.” Sholeh grabbed the quill and scribbled on the line for her wages. Workers paid a fine for lost equipment, so she signed again that she received her proper inventory. She signed yet again for a liability waiver for the dangers of stonecutting. Sholeh sighed. Only the Empire could make so much paperwork to do a job. She strode to an open area with a mountain of rocks needing to be rough cut. At least she wasn’t stacking the heavy loads of stones as her day job. Few lasted more than a week before looking for easier employment. The work of a mason was steady with the rhythm of hammer and chisel. The skills to work on the different materials was more than she could handle, but she appreciated the recognition that she could hold her own amongst the apprentices. Sholeh shrugged off her cloak and hung it to the side. She hadn’t figured out a way to keep the blasted pieces of rock and dust from creating a layer of grime over her clothes. She flexed her bare arms in the morning light and stretched her lower back for the job ahead. Sholeh measured the hammer and its balance. Rough indeed and barely enough to do the work. Her chisel and hammer began their rhythm. Sholeh’s body was tuned for this methodical work. Rock blasted away from the stones with each impact. Her arms drove the chisel from top to bottom and smoothed the edges. Working metal was hard work, and the techniques needed to become a master required years of dedicated effort. She assumed a mason's performance was similar, although she wouldn’t learn the necessary skills past an apprentice. As soon as she could get Kincaid out of here. Kincaid. The rock blew apart in her fury. The blows came faster. A cough caught Sholeh’s swing at the top of the arc. The polite clearing of a throat forced her attention away from the impact. She lowered the hammer and looked up from work. Four guards waited around her work area. Worse, each of them wore the colors of the church on the tunic over their armor. Sholeh grounded her tools and wiped her hands on her work smock. All she did was move around the sweaty grime, but the movement gave her a chance to think. “The patriarch requests the honor of your presence.” One of the guards bowed and presented paperwork. Always paperwork. Sholeh didn’t reach for the scroll or acknowledge the request. “How would the patriarch know where to find me?” “I believe the patriarch had people searching for days. To find you here… working.” “Yes, I am sure the patriarch would find it difficult to believe that people labor with hammers and chisels. Work for their living.” “I would not pretend to know what the patriarch thinks. But you should accompany us to the church.” “I don’t think so.” Other workers put their hammers down as they picked up the conversation’s tension. They moved away and gestured at the standoff while supervisors noticed the work stoppage. “He was afraid you would say that. We have orders to arrest you, if necessary. Don’t make us execute those orders. Please.” Sholeh sized each one. They were more than a ceremonial guard; they were trained warriors with proper equipment and weapons. She remembered watching them practice when she was much younger. Each bore a determined look on their faces. Sholeh had no misconceptions; they would do their duty. “Is there a problem?” Adelaise walked into the area cleared by the confrontation. She wore her weapons and did not show concern for the odds. Sholeh wanted to sigh with relief. They couldn’t take on four warriors, but the show of force would be enough to make them question their orders. They only came to find a stonecutter. “We have orders to bring the woman to the church.” He presented the orders to Adelaise, finally finding someone who would look at them. The mercenary looked over the paperwork and focused on the seal of the church. Sholeh prayed the woman wouldn’t turn her over to these thugs. “Do you want to go with these men, Sholeh?” “No, I have no business there. My work is here in the Outer City, away from the guilds and the centers of power.” Mail jingled, and weapons rattled as the guards considered their orders. “I think you have the woman’s answer. Not interested today. Try again tomorrow?” “Then you saw we have orders to arrest her. Either way, she’s coming with us.” “I did. But I don’t think we will let you do that today. How about another day? These people won’t say anything if you can’t find her.” “Stand down, mercenary. You don’t need a patriarch as an enemy.” “Enemies are easy. Friends are hard to come by. I really think you should change your mind. What do you think, Sigurd?” She raised her voice to command levels, and it carried across the stone yard. “Please draw your swords. A fight would make me feel better.” Sigurd smiled as he raised his strung bow. A yard-long shaft was already nocked and ready on the massive bow. His arms were bare like Sholeh’s, but leather armor covered his chest. “Take them in.” Swords leaped from their sheaths, and the morning sun flashed across the clearing. Mail armor rattled with the move. But Adelaise was a blur. Her weapons were clear of their sheaths, the longer blade with the elaborate bell grip in her right hand and the smaller edge in her left. With a twist, Adelaise thrust the small blade through the leader’s hand before his sword could move forward in defense. Adelaise’s long edge slipped through his chainmail at his armpit. His lifeless body slumped to the ground in the rattle of the mail. The heavy creak of a bow draw and snap with a release was next. In a fraction of time, the hunting arrow slammed into a target behind Sholeh. The force was enough to tear through mail and drive the man two feet backward as he collapsed from the impact. The guards moved to defend themselves against equal odds. Sholeh hoped they regretted this morning. They probably wished they brought some friends. She scooped up a hammer and stood near Adelaise. The patrol made their move and came in. Adelaise weaved a wall of steel that prevented a blow from coming close. Simultaneously, Sholeh swung her hammer in a wide, low arc to keep the other attacker at bay. If Sigurd would take the next shot. Instead, he drew the long blade and vaulted over several workspaces to attack the pair from behind. Adelaise stopped playing with her opponent and ran him through with her sword. He never had a chance. The last guard’s arm came up to defend with his sword against his three opponents, and Sigurd’s hack came down. The man’s right arm separated from its shoulder and flopped on the ground with spurts of blood staining the white stone in the work area. Sholeh finished the job with a pounding blow on the man’s head. The yard was silent except for their heavy breathing. “That one was mine, yes?” “You shouldn’t have started so far away.” “Next time, I will shoot one of them as you fight. Show you I can make the shot.” Adelaise cleaned the gore off her blades using the church guards’ tunics. She rolled one over with her foot and checked to see if they had any other paperwork. “Still looks like I got two.” Sholeh was stunned at the exchange. Faster than most people could blink, they killed four elite guards of the church. And now they joked about it. “By all that is holy, we should not be figuring out who won.” “I did.” “You big oaf. I see sword wounds in the chest of two of them. An arrow—” “Please. These are the church’s guards. Ceremonial sentries of the patriarchs. They will come looking for them. And me.” “Then we should not be here, yes? Join me for a drink.” The worksite foreman approached with his hands limp at his sides and head ducked. “Sholeh, you should leave. I will give you a head start before I must call the watch. You were an outstanding worker, and we will miss you. Now you must go.” Sholeh held her fist to her heart and thanked the man. People approached the bodies and pointed at the wounds. With these witnesses whispering their stories, it was time for them to leave. Sholeh grabbed her few belongings and followed her companions out. The four bodies were more than she could handle now.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Challenges",
      "content": "Kincaid - Challenges The ecstasy of power filled his soul and rushed through his veins. The stolen soul channeled the arcane flow. With a twist of his newly found power, Kincaid pushed the field of magic wider. The students’ hidden study house remained still. He pushed the circle around him farther, and the stolen soul groaned from the strain. Magic inflicted its toll. No one would come outside for the next few moments. Kincaid stood alone outside his objective as a grin curled the corner of his lips. Face your future. Take what you need from them. Find me. With another twist, the magic collapsed around him. He closed the flow of magic, and emptiness left its void in his soul. His legs weakened from the exertion. He pushed the images of the voice from his mind. They’d know he was coming from the channel of power he created. That was fine today. He was past the academic stage and was ready to practice the abilities he owned. He pulled on the door and strode inside. The lights flickered with the blast of winter air. Raised voices filtered down the hallway as men and women were in a debate. Conversations stopped as Kincaid entered, and all eyes shifted toward the young magi. Even without a channel open to the arcane plane, Kincaid sensed the hum of power. Students weaved power within their souls, and all kept magic flowing as he entered. “Good evening, students of Damis.” Kincaid smiled to disarm the tension, and he noticed three new members of the group stood near chairs and couches in the main living area. None returned his smile. “Kincaid, that was you? Outside in the street,” Darya said. Kincaid nodded. “That much power…” one of the new students whispered loud enough for Kincaid to catch. “No more than anyone else here.” He pointed out Bartalan, standing behind a couch and at the back of the group. “Or even Cy when he manipulates his illusions around the room.” Several shook their heads. Kincaid was sure he wasn’t using more power than anyone else. They’d shown him the way to exert control over the flow and find his natural talent. With the proper focus, he could limit the drain on his soul. Kincaid tried again. “I can feel the magic pumping through the room right now. I came to learn more about how the schools give you knowledge. Share with me.” None of the students met his gaze around the room. “Kincaid, you are different,” Darya said. “I’m the same person you knew before. I learned everything the hard way.” “We know that. But you are different right now. The student is gone, and a powerful magi stands here,” Etty, one of the students from his previous visits, said. She was usually reserved, merely happy to be part of the group. “My quest was to come to Pilaetium to learn from the schools. You all know that. And both schools rejected me. Until you brought me in to show the nuances of power.” “And now we know why,” one of the newcomers added. Kincaid set his jaw and crossed his arms. The standoff continued. “You’ve already taught me so much in a short amount of time. I had no idea magic could be used this way. I didn’t know about the talents.” “We can use magic, Kincaid. But none of us can do it like you.” Bartalan’s voice was low, and he kept his place in the back of the group. “Right, you can work with gravity, light, darkness, illusion, and anything your minds can dream. I’ve spent more time working with elemental magic, but that’s something everyone can figure out. That doesn’t make me much different than you.” “You know more, Kincaid. Far more than you are letting on.” Bartalan moved forward and challenged him. His magic was powerful as it pumped through his soul, and Kincaid wondered why the other students didn’t view him the same way. “I need to understand more, Bartalan. You have told me so much, and yet so little. We can share our knowledge.” “I think you already know too much, Kincaid.” “I don’t understand what’s happening.” Kincaid turned toward Darya. He missed her smile and her warmth near his body. Somehow, Bartalan turned her against him. She refused to return his gaze. “So, where does this leave us, Bartalan?” Kincaid asked. “That depends on what you will share. It turns out the Emperor is interested in a magi who frequented the schools. A powerful, unaligned magi with unusual gifts. Know anyone like that, Kincaid?” “If the Emperor is interested in me, then it’s because you told him something. Something that can’t be true.” Kincaid glanced to see who he could sway to his side. None budged. “You won’t find allies here, even with your girlfriend.” Darya looked down at her feet. “When you are gone, we’ll still be here finishing our studies and finding our places in the Empire.” “Leave everyone else out of it.” “You brought them into it.” Bartalan gestured around the group. His hands were wide open, and his robes flowed around him. Kincaid squinted at the flow of power that surrounded him. Bartalan looked like an avenging god. “I don’t want to fight you, Bartalan. We will destroy the city.” “I don’t think so. Even with your magic and your secrets…” Bartalan motioned with his hands to bring the fight to him. Kincaid glanced around the room. Everyone else edged away from the men. Magic surged through them all, and Kincaid knew the moment he pulled in his arcane surge, the fight would be on. Images flashed in his mind of Caesea’s destruction. The broken body of Vedette Atros at his feet flooded his memories. The prison holding Sholeh. Tents to house the wounded and the homeless with their sightless stares. “You should leave, Kincaid,” Darya said in a low voice. She endured the glare from Bartalan with a wince. “No, I think he would be better served as a prisoner for the Emperor to question.” Magic surged in the room, and Kincaid felt his legs grow heavy from the pull downwards. Bartalan grinned with bared teeth. No more. Magic surged across the planes and flooded Kincaid’s stolen soul with might. Show them. Make them serve you, not this fool. Kincaid wielded his power and twisted a column of air to hold his weight. With a surge of arcane strength, he jumped out of the growing gravity. Bartalan raised an eyebrow. Kincaid thought, he’s never fought another wizard. They’ve only worked with each other in this magical study, not when lives were on the line. “I’m done playing this game, Bartalan. I’ve fought sorceratti, claimed the lives of magi, and now I’m going to add hecaerae to my list.” Kincaid couldn’t decipher the amusement in Bartalan’s eyes. “Arrogant fool. Come to the heart of Pilaetium and tell us your tales. Should I tell you one?” Kincaid twisted the magic around him and looked just a few seconds into the future. Magic surged across them all, but he couldn’t see the effects of the exchange. The power wasn’t helping right now. He released that strand of magic and stood his ground. “Bartalan, no. Don’t!” Darya said. The plea distracted Kincaid as he considered his next play. Any magi was a match for the hecaerae. As he saw in his vision of the future, magic surged in the room. Kincaid tried to pull in a shield of raw arcane power to block an attack. But none came. And then his magic was gone. Nothing surged through his soul. His heart, mind, and soul lunged for the magic, but it was out of his reach. The arcane plane was cut off to him, and he could no longer sense the powers of magic surging within the room. He took two steps backward toward the hallway and kept his eyes on Bartalan. The young man strode forward like a conquerer. “You need to hear my tale, Kincaid, magi of the west. Did you know what my power was? I don’t think so, but you might be figuring it out now.” Sobs came from the room, but Kincaid couldn’t see who it was through the approaching figure of Bartalan. Kincaid felt his back press against the wall, and his feet couldn’t back up fast enough to get away from the angel of death stalking him. “My power is to cut others off from the arcane plane.” “No. It can’t be.” Kincaid tried to move his feet, but his legs were heavy again. He collapsed to the floor under the growing weight around him. Even his hands were hard to pull up to defend his body from the figure towering over him. “Oh, it is. People have told me their souls are empty. The bodies long for the touch. But it’s out of their reach. How does it feel for you?” Kincaid’s mind raged at the impotence to strike back. He’d killed others for less than this. The assault was too much, and he had no response to this provocation. He laid on the floor as he couldn’t hold his hands up anymore. “Funny. Most don’t answer either.” Kincaid watched lines crinkle across Bartalan’s eyes. He was drawing in magic to hold him still and cut off his flow of power. A glimmer of hope flickered in Kincaid’s heart. Bartalan drew back his fist and slammed Kincaid’s nose. Stars flew as his cartilage crunched from the impact. Even if he had his short sword, Kincaid knew he wouldn’t be able to draw it with the magic around him. The fist drew back again. The impact bounced Kincaid’s head off the floor. He fought back the darkness rushing to the edge of his vision. He held off long enough to spit in Bartalan’s face. To his surprise, the spittle didn’t go anywhere under the high gravity. He drooled down his chin instead. The fist came back and pounded. Kincaid didn’t feel the other blows as darkness claimed him. But the image of satisfaction on Bartalan’s face was etched in his mind.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Lost",
      "content": "Kincaid - Lost Kincaid coughed out the filth in his lungs. His mouth burned from the acid, and his face was wet from his hair to his chin. The stench of garbage and sewage gagged his throat. He put a hand underneath his torso to lift himself out of the gutter of rancid filth. His shoulder and arms protested the action, and exhaustion wracked his entire body. Kincaid found the strength gone, but he managed to pull himself upright. Using one hand, he brushed off chunks of refuse. Kincaid looked around and knew he was back in the Outer City. The alley looked the same as every other slum in cities around the realms. He had no idea where he was. Memories of the short fight came back as his mind grappled with his current situation. Bartalan cut him off from the arcane plane even as the student beat him into darkness. Cut off. Completely. Kincaid reached for the arcane world through his heart and mind. He couldn’t sense the power. It wasn’t beyond his reach. It was gone from his mind and denied to him. The magi focused his soul and mind on the challenge around him. He opened himself up to the magic to flow into his soul, and he found nothing. How could Bartalan take his power away from him? A wizard paid the price of using magic with his or her soul. Kincaid could shape and form the power to his will, and his mind could create extraordinary results with his efforts. If the price could be paid, arcane power was theirs to wield. Except for now. Kincaid pulled himself to his feet, and his legs struggled to carry his weight. It was more than the fatigue from using magic coursing through his body. It was as if part of his body was gone. In the few months since he learned the powers and the secrets of magic, Kincaid became reliant on the strength to get him out of the worst situations. The deliberate use of magic helped him in his toughest places. At least that’s what he imagined. Everything was different now. He was stranded in a city without a purpose, and they didn’t have the means to leave. How could he explain to Sholeh what happened? Each step led to another step. Kincaid put his feet forward to get into the main road. He had to find a sign or maybe even the water to figure out where the students dumped him. If it was even the students. The main road was unfinished work with stones still being laid. The main street structures looked temporary, as if builders made the fastest structure possible and left the job behind. He was at the edge of the capital, almost beyond the walls. They went out of their way to dump him. Or send a message. Kincaid kept moving toward the finished areas of the street. If he headed east, he’d make his way back toward the parts of the city he’d recognize. With luck, Kincaid could make it back to their inn. The morning sky shifted colors with the glow of the promise of the rising sun. The winters were cold but beautiful in Pilaetium. The red brush swept across the horizon before the sun climbed above the hills of the straights. Kincaid typically took a moment to enjoy the sunrise, but his soul was uneasy, and his mind wandered. His feet drifted down the street. A dog growled from another alley and bared its teeth. Kincaid doubted it would come close enough to take a smell. He navigated his way back to the inn and stopped by a rain barrel. He couldn’t walk back into their room, smelling like he crawled through the lowest sewer—more questions than he’d want to answer before his head hit the bed. Clothes came off his body, and chills shook him from head to toe. Kincaid poured water from the barrel onto his clothes laid out on the street. As his teeth clacked from the cold, he might as well have jumped into the barrel. At least he got the worst off. Tucking the clothes under his arms, he walked into the inn's main room wearing nothing but his small clothes and boots. He was sure if anyone woke from their slumber, they’d find the oddest sight of a man sneaking in with clothes under his arms. The door swung open with the slightest pressure, and Sholeh sat upright. Her hands were already in motion for her hammer. “Sholeh, please, it’s me.” “Kincaid, what are you doing?” “Apologizing.” “By all that is holy, what is that smell?” “That’s part of the reason I need to apologize to you.” “Take the clothes outside. We will clean them in the morning. What did you do?” “I lost.” “Your sense of smell?” “Worse, Sholeh. Worse.” The woman got up from her bed and took the two steps toward him. In the pre-dawn gloom, concern etched her face. Her forehead wrinkled, and her hands reached out for Kincaid’s arms. She heard it in his voice. “You didn’t sound this bad when you came to me after prison. What is wrong?” “I haven’t been the best of friends, have I?” “I would never say that, Kincaid. You have been my friend and more for some time.” “I left you alone again tonight. I didn’t help with the money.” Sholeh nodded and stayed close to him. She wasn’t worried about what he hadn’t done. “I went back to the wizards, but I went back with power.” Sholeh dropped her hands to her sides as her eyes were wide. “By all that is holy, you did not.” “I did. I stole another soul, and I went back to the hecaerae. I wanted to learn more, and I wanted it all.” “But at what price?” “The price was my soul, Sholeh.” Kincaid sniffled and wiped a tear away from his eye. “We need to clean you up, my friend. Downstairs, now.” The pair walked back through the empty common area. With a pair of buckets, they drew an icy bath behind the inn. It wasn’t much more than a trough for animals, but it would have to do for the young man. With a brush, they got the worst off Kincaid. His skin ached from the brush’s firm bristles. Sholeh’s attention on his exhausted body didn’t change his heavy heart from what he had already done. “Sholeh, I—” “Shhh. Not here.” They used one of their small blankets to wrap Kincaid’s shivering body, and he lingered by the fire to get his sense of feeling back in his hands and toes. Sholeh waited for him to get back to the stairs. “What happened with the wizards?” She closed the door behind them and helped him to his bed. “I wanted to learn so much more, Sholeh. They have so many powers, and they teach the fundamentals of magic in a way that I don’t know if Magi Cormac even understood.” She nodded to let him continue. Kincaid rubbed his legs under the thin, dry blanket. Sholeh tossed him another blanket to wrap around his shoulders again. “That does not explain the smell.” “I ended up in a fight with one of their leaders.” “What? How can you fight with the students?” “They think I know more about magic than I was letting on. They are right, but I could never share the secret Cormac shared with me.” “You were wise not to tell them. Imagine what would happen if the powers of Pilaetium knew…” “Exactly.” They paused and stared at one another. Kincaid hoped she would just get mad at him and let him have it. He wanted her to take it out on him, make him suffer more for his decisions. He deserved every harsh word she could imagine. Even worse, she was silent. “The wizard, Bartalan, he confronted me. Our magic clashed—” “Like Caesea?” “No, not like that at all. I was afraid that is what would happen with a confrontation of wizards in the heart of the city. We’d destroy the whole thing. But he came at me with all his skills. One of them is to cut people off from the arcane plane.” “I do not understand what that means.” “I don’t either. But I can’t feel it, Sholeh. I can’t feel any of it outside of my mind or my soul. It’s just not there.” “Like it was before you understood you could use magic?” “No, I’ve thought that my skills with wood were based on my use of magic. Even if I didn’t know what I was doing, it was there for me. I could use it on a subconscious level. It’s not even there anymore. It’s part of my soul, and it’s gone.” “How is that even possible?” “It shouldn’t be possible to separate a person from the arcane plane, especially when I figured out the sorceratti weren’t special because they were royal family. They are only different because they are trained. I think just about anyone can touch the arcane plane to a greater or lesser degree.” “And this wizard took that away from you?” “I can’t feel it. That’s all that I know.” “We need to find a way to get it back.” “Why? I am back to what I was. People won’t be wondering what I can do anymore, and then I won’t have to worry about being a magi again.” His voice dropped away as he pushed aside a sob. “By all that is holy, you must not think like this. You are not dead, and we will find your touch with the arcane plane. There are too many enemies around here looking for you not to have magic to protect yourself. And us.” Those last words caught Kincaid’s attention. She looked away from him as she said them. “What happened today, Sholeh?” “I lost my job at the quarry.” “Hmm, you are one of the best workers they’ve had. I would imagine you could start in one of their guilds with your practiced hand.” “The church came looking for me.” “What happened when they found you?” “Adelaise and Sigurd were amazing.” Kincaid groaned. That could only mean one thing. “How many bodies?” “Four.” “Has anyone come looking?” “Not yet. I think they will keep the watch away for a while, but the church will come looking, and they will bring the fires of heaven with them.” “They were looking for me?” “No, me.” “There’s so much you haven’t told me.” “This is true. And it scares me that you do not have your magic.” Kincaid’s desperation reached out for the flow of magic. He wanted to assure his friend that there was nothing in this town that could affect them. They would never be afraid again. But the power wasn’t at his command. He sensed it now, just out of his reach. Beyond his mind and his soul. Of no use to the magi and his friend.",

      "title": "Bartalan - Aspirations",
      "content": "Bartalan - Aspirations The Emperor fell to his knees, eyes downcast to the marbled floor. His purple silks fell around him. Supplicants, nobles, merchants, patriarchs, and the royal family gasped with the end of the imperial reign. Bartalan ushered in a new era. With a cabal of hecaerae to enforce his will, the power of the Empire was his to command. The Empire would bend a knee to him. And then the world. The vision raced through Bartalan’s veins. The Emperor can’t resist you, and the Empire will fall to your power and wisdom. Magic will take its rightful place as the tool of your hands. The voice rang in Bartalan’s mind, shaking the image of success with each word. He could be the Emperor, and he could craft the Empire to do his will. Find the practitioners of magic and bring them under one control. The trickle of magic coursed through his veins and flooded his soul with triumphant notes of power. He wouldn’t relinquish his iron control over those forces, but he felt each surge as Kincaid struggled to regain access to the arcane plane. Bartalan would make him feel the desperation of isolation. He’d keep the magi from the west away from magic until he begged for release. The schools would see the talent they had in the young hecaerae in their midst. The collection of students in their remote house refused to make eye contact with him. He made them wait as a pair of students dragged away the unconscious magi and dumped him in the Outer City. They’d be gone for a while, but he didn’t need any of them losing their nerve. Their student circle had to become more than a study group. They already knew more than the hecaerae of the fifth rank. As the pair returned from the Outer City, the group turned their eyes toward him, as if waiting for instructions. He couldn’t hold back his grin from the corner of his mouth. Magic stayed firm in his soul. “Why, Bartalan?” Of course it would be her, Bartalan thought. The one student with feelings toward the magi would stand up in defiance. “Because we need to be more than what the schools are teaching us. We shouldn’t be sheep in the Empire, sitting around in expensive clothes and examining our place in the universe until the darkness comes and claims us for the last time.” “What does that have to do with Kincaid?” A few nods around the room now. Arms started to cross, and feet began to shuffle. “The magi was hiding something from us. From all of us. I don’t know exactly what it is, but we all felt the surge… No, the wave of magic that hit us. And then he walked in. How could he do that?” Bartalan strode around the room, stopping in front of each student and looking them in the eyes. “Now, he will never reveal what he knows,” one of the male students said. Bartalan spun toward him. “I don’t think he intended to tell us anything. Rejected by our schools, fleeing from Caesea, and the killer of wizards in the west. What did we think he would do? Open his knowledge and start his school with us?” “But our group is different. We agreed to share our powers and learn from each other. Learn the things we wouldn’t be taught in class,” Darya said. “Our group is very different. I agree.” Bartalan’s voice trailed away. He forced them to lean in to hear his words. “But we all agreed that we would practice outside of the confines of the school. Even at the threat of expulsion, or exile.” “But now the Emperor is involved,” another student added. “Of course, the Emperor would be interested in an immigrant with powers to rival any of our schools.” “But how did the Emperor find out about Kincaid, Bartalan?” Darya asked. She wasn’t backing down, and her scowl deepened to reflect her distrust. “Spies are everywhere, Darya. It’s the game of power in the Inner City. Everyone wants to keep track of the others, and the Empire's leadership is always interested in what the wizards are doing. They have no choice; they fear us.” “Fear us, or fear you?” “Do you think the powers of the Empire will distinguish between individuals? We wear the robes of our schools and the colors of the Empire. Once fear sets in, they won’t be too picky about where to take their revenge.” Darya shook her head. The others were quiet and stopped fidgeting. They weren’t a poetry club of dreamers longing for a better world. They were hecaerae, practitioners of arcane might. They could be a force to be reckoned with. “What happens to the magi?” one of the female students asked. “Where did you two bring him?” Bartalan gestured to the two students who brought him to the Outer City. “Just past where they’re building the new wall. We left him in a gutter.” Bartalan knew he could trust him. That was the reason why he ordered the young man to lead the pair to dump Kincaid’s body. “We must consider our plans. The magi has no place in our future. In fact, I would imagine that he will consider leaving Pilaetium behind. He’s out of allies, without money, and separated from his magic. That should be enough to allow us to continue.” “Why didn’t you tell us you could divide a person from the arcane plane?” Darya asked. “Didn’t I?” “No, you didn’t. Until you explained to Kincaid what you were doing, I thought your power was to shift the strength of gravity.” “Oh, I can do that just fine, just like any of you. But I can feel the flow of magic differently. I can see each strand in my senses and determine the flow. All I have to do is tie off those channels, and the person is separated.” “So this is your secret. One that you didn’t share with the rest of us.” “What was I supposed to tell you, Darya? Please be careful. I might decide to cut off your magic. It’s not as easy as that.” “It’s never that easy, is it? Just like Kincaid not telling us everything about what he knows about magic.” “Look, we need to decide what the goals of this group are.” “And if we disagree? You’ll cut us from the arcane plane?” Bartalan bit his tongue. If he continued this fight, he’d lose them all. This group was the most willing to learn about the powers of magic and the flows they could channel. Each of them loved the element of risk in their practice. The schools could catch any of them, and some couldn’t afford the punishment. But they all stayed. If the risk became too high, they would fade away from the group. They’d go back to the pasture of sheep in the school and listen to the teachers' baying and hypothesizing about another abstract value of magic that none of them could prove. He couldn’t have that. “Darya, you are right. I should have told you there was more to magic. When we look at the flow of magic… We all feel it, right? When people channel magic, there had to be a way to disrupt the flow.” Magic exhausted Bartalan. He’d already pinched his stream of magic to the slightest flow of power and still maintain the link. His body ached from the earlier combat, and the fatigue of staying up all night was enough to keep his mind dull. Just a bit longer. “We need to remember why we started this group. We have a passion for magic that runs deeper than the schools. Each of us wants to know more about what we can do. And we all know the ancient teachers pacing the classrooms don’t know enough to satisfy our hunger. Our group needs to explore, and we need to keep this within our group.” The others nodded their heads. Darya wasn’t willing to confirm her commitment to the rest of the group. She’d defy them for a moment longer. Bartalan had to figure a way to keep her with the group. They’d already come together so far, and she represented the dissenting voice of the group since they started. Bartalan admitted he needed Darya. “We should get some sleep. We’ll feel better in the morning. But we have to meet tomorrow night. I will answer every question that you all might have.” Bartalan didn’t take his eyes off Darya. She nodded.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Choices",
      "content": "Adelaise - Choices The fight in the stonecutter’s yard changed Sigurd. His playful disregard for the law now had an edge of reality. In a few brief minutes of fighting, they’d created powerful enemies. Soon enough, the church would find the attackers, and their lives would be under continual assault. Adelaise could have used an archer with his skills in her company. Every mercenary captain valued a soldier who could punch through armor at one hundred yards. As fast as Sigurd could draw an arrow to his cheek and put it into flight, the commander in her knew he could outshoot any firearm for accuracy and speed. A good man to have around. But the northerner struggled with his place now. His bruises settled into ugly blacks and purples. When the adrenaline wore off, he shifted from his lanky gait to the stiff walk of the wounded. There was nothing a surgeon could fix on the northerner. Only time could heal those wounds. Adelaise was confident the group who beat up Sigurd had limited patience for his exploits or his failure. Whatever they wanted from him would be a bill that would come due. If he wasn’t working on that request's success, he would find himself with more than bruises. Adding the underworld to Adelaise’s list of adversaries wasn’t on her to-do list. Still, Sigurd was good to have in their group. Her spymaster would also demand updates. She couldn’t ignore her problems within the city. Adelaise already risked too much by sacrificing everything she loved, and whoever bought the spymaster had exceptional leverage over her decisions. Adelaise gazed down at her frothy beverage. Kincaid and Sholeh had their problems from the upper reaches of power. Some company. Impossible tasks. She looked up at Sigurd as he nursed his beer and ignored her scrutiny. The captain needed to work on one problem at a time. She couldn’t calculate the problems with magic. What she did know is they couldn’t sit waiting for their doom. Morale was a commander’s responsibility. “Sigurd, very nice shot at the stonecutters.” Sigurd nodded but didn’t make eye contact. “You didn’t have to fight with us. When I caught sight of the church making its way to Sholeh, I had to follow. She is part of my company.” The icy blue eyes turned toward her. Instead of a boastful braggart, Adelaise only saw a young man suppressing the pain of his injuries. “You would have lost if you fought all four.” “Hardly. Sholeh picked up a hammer and was ready to fight.” Sigurd smiled, “But you needed a bow and another blade to take them. You are fast with your toothpick sword, but not fast enough.” “Ah, then maybe someday you will have to see what my sword can do against several warriors.” “I would like that, but it would be better if I was at your side. I do not wish to fight fair when we can kill from a distance. And when they get close, we fight to win, yes?” Wise words from the young man. He was no stranger to fights and probably even served on a campaign or two. “You are a talented fighter, Sigurd. Why not fight with the mercenaries?” “Did not work out for you.” He gave her a crooked smile and took a drink. “Does not work well for me. Too many rules to fight with a company. Small groups are better.” “But you are working with a group now.” “Different problem.” He broke eye contact again. He wasn’t ready to discuss, but Adelaise was out of time to work through the minor details. As he said, when they got in close, they fight to win. “Why did you quarrel with your employers?” “The same reason you struggle with yours, yes?” He was right, and she didn’t like it. “We fall short of expectations sometimes, and that makes a difference with those who would employ us. But I’d like to help you.” “Not sure what you could do with my problems. The group expects me to finish a job I started. Impossible now that the merchant is expecting another invasion.” “Where Kincaid found you?” “That is the one, yes. Sigurd the thief, running from the watch because the objective wasn’t there.” “Let’s find them.” “The target isn’t a person; it’s a thing. Not something you can help me with.” “Then let’s go after the people who have your contract. Make them change their minds.” Sigurd smiled at her through swollen lips. He leaned back and put his feet up on a chair, even as he winced from the effort. “Hmm, a new idea. But then they will hunt me down.” Adelaise shook her head. “Believe me, even if you win, they will find something else for you to do. No one gets away from these people of power in this damn city. Once they have their claws in, they won’t let you go.” Sigurd looked around the room to see who might take an interest in the two foreigners sharing a large beverage. This was a mercenary’s bar, and people left each other alone. Adelaise trusted the owners. They’d fought and bleed for each other, and a small job amongst sellswords wasn’t worth selling people out. If spies weren’t in the room, they’d be ok. And Gechina was a good barkeep and knew her patrons. No one would be close enough to find out what they planned. “What do you think? Let’s end your debt to this group. Then we get out of here.” “Sigurd the thief has heard enough of these stories. You are not helping me because you like me, yes?” Adelaise leaned forward into the table, and the hilts of her weapons banged against the beer-stained wood. “I hope you will help me with my debt as well. The target we chase will be one of the hardest yet. But I need you to be free from your employers before we tackle mine. We don’t want them joined up against us.” “Do we tell the others?” “The blacksmith and the carpenter? Why would they help us?” “The blacksmith is strong and sure with her hammers, and the carpenter is also a wizard.” Sigurd leaned over and spat to the side after the mention of magic. But he continued, “Both would be good to have around.” “Taking on your employers with the four of us will be dangerous. They aren’t experienced enough to know when things are going bad, and they don’t know when to withdraw. You do.” Sigurd gave a slow nod and held his beer to his mouth. “Yes, indeed. A pair of blades taking on thieves.” “I’m hoping you can use your bow. Let’s not get into a fight where we are using a few blades against your organization.” “Good enough. Let us drink to our success.” Adelaise smiled and enjoyed her beer. The old Sigurd was back, and she hoped they lived long enough to go after what she valued against the spymaster. A thief would be useful, and his blade was a faithful companion. But against the roles of a spy, she wondered if it would be enough.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Time in the City",
      "content": "Sholeh - Time in the City Sholeh paced their room like an expectant parent. Kincaid tossed and turned on his mattress, and his breath came in fitful gasps. He was hurting from the inside out. And Sholeh didn’t know how she could come to terms with the church and the wizards at the same time. No one had the strength to do both. They couldn’t stay here; their time was limited. As he laid in bed, Kincaid’s brow crunched with each moan slipping between his clenched teeth. Even if he laid exhausted after a day’s work, he’d have an empty look. Now, he had a haunted expression on his face. Part of him was gone. She could not wait any longer, and she touched him on the shoulder. His eyes popped open—those green eyes under all that red hair. Intelligence and passion usually flooded those eyes. Now the tide had gone out from his expression. His spirit was gone. “We cannot stay here for too long, Kincaid. We need to keep moving before the church closes in on us.” “Sigurd and Adelaise? Are they back?” “No, and they thought it best that we do not gather too many times. Finding one person is very difficult. But finding a group of immigrants with swords makes the challenge simple. We should head out as well.” Kincaid did not get his body out of bed. His face was battered from a fist, but she’d seen him with worse wounds. No broken bones or cuts through his skin. He was under the bruises, somewhere. “By all that is holy, do you plan on lying in bed until someone comes and drags you out? This is not the Kincaid I know.” “The Kincaid you know got into a fight with a wizard and lost. I’m not a magi anymore.” “The man I know is more than a magi. You were trying to be a hero before you had any idea you could use magic. There is more to you than this, Kincaid.” A rapping tapped against the door. Sholeh threw a glance toward the entrance and then lunged to grab one of her hammers. The tapping became more insistent. Voices murmured from the other side. Kincaid rolled out of bed to his feet and stepped behind the door. At least he clutched the short sword in his hand. Sholeh cracked the door with her left hand and held the hammer high. “Stonecutter Sholeh, they are coming. We hate to bother you, but you’ve been nice enough to us.” “Who is coming?” “The church. A group of knights and priests are only a few blocks away. My son saw them.” “How do they know they are coming for me?” “They stopped and asked for directions, stonecutter. You need to leave. For all of us.” “Thank you—” “The back stairs. May all that is holy go with you.” Sholeh grabbed her bag and flung her belt around her waist. She slid the hammers into the loops and grabbed her cloak. Kincaid was in motion. He hopped on one foot, trying to pull his boots on. His bag was flung on the mattress, and his sword was nearby. He gave a few curse words as he got his boots on. It was good enough for now. “Time for us to leave.” Sholeh and Kincaid headed for the landing to the dining room when the door's crash echoed throughout the structure. Cold air rushed into the area. “In the name of the church, you are ordered to stand fast. No one is to move.” Sholeh and Kincaid shared a glance. From this position on the landing, they couldn’t make it to the kitchen without the knights spotting them. “You, by the fire, do you know of a blacksmith? She goes by the name Sholeh.” Heart racing, Sholeh grabbed Kincaid’s hand and pulled him back into their room. One way out now. The window was small but only two floors up. Sholeh threw open the shutters and glanced outside. At least no one was in the alley behind the inn. Boots thundered up the stairs. The door closest to the stairs exploded inwards from a kick. More voices were shouting from feet away. Sholeh went back to the window, and Kincaid grabbed her hands. She went out backward as Kincaid lowered her as far as he could to the ground. Another door exploded inwards. This time across the hall. Voices shouted from the common room as Sholeh let go and fell the last few feet to the ground. She caught her balance and looked up to gesture Kincaid to follow. Kincaid glanced back over his shoulder, waved, and then closed the shuttered window. By all that is holy, he cannot do this. Not now, Sholeh thought. She looked up and down the alley and threw her cloak around her shoulders and pulled the cowl over her head. The sound of wood splintering came from above. She couldn’t betray her friend, and she headed away from the inn. The Outer City had no shortage of alleys and pockets of darkness to conceal from the church entourage, but Kincaid needed a place to find her. She found a spot to observe the front door of the tavern. A knight stood watch in his gleaming mail and clean tunic. The sword was bare and pointed in the dirt with both hands resting on the pommel. No one would challenge this image of authority. The shouts were loud from the inn. A priest stormed out and looked back toward the inn’s structure. He looked upwards toward the second floor and glanced both ways to the side of the building. Another knight came out of the door and joined the priest. The knight had his weapon sheathed and held a calm demeanor. His voice was a low rumble of patience to counteract the priest’s agitation. Sholeh couldn’t turn away as more knights emerged from the common room. They looked up and down the streets, and the gathering of priests huddled together. Hands pointed to different areas, and voices rose over the sounds of the streets. People hurried by the display of authority, none wanting to draw their attention. Sholeh stepped back into the shadows as the knights formed up to get their instructions. At least Kincaid hadn’t emerged under arrest or within the confines of the gathering. A knight and a priest paired up to make four groups. After issuing a final set of instructions, they spread out to cover the streets and the buildings near the inn. A pair headed directly for Sholeh’s alley. She took a last glance toward the second floor and hoped for one glimpse of Kincaid making his way down the wall. The movement of church officials made an escape from the tavern impossible. They’d have to find another way to link up after the church lost interest in the area. With no more time to waste, Sholeh turned and walked away from the inn and her friend. She chose streets and alleys at random, working her course toward the docks. She hoped Kincaid remembered their plan in case they got separated.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Chains",
      "content": "Kincaid - Chains The knights filed through the small hallway and thumped down the stairs. Kincaid didn’t let his guard down in case they made an abrupt return. They accepted his story about his immigrant sister out looking for work. He claimed he was getting ready for his evening shift at the docks. Kincaid shrugged aside questions about Sholeh and a young blacksmith. The patrol continued their search in the inn’s remaining rooms. Shouted voices and thumping boots made waiting alone torture. Kincaid’s thoughts focused on action. Slipping out the window, finding his friend, and grabbing Sholeh’s hand was foremost on his mind. Kincaid needed to make sure they were safe. He couldn’t afford for them to get much worse. Boots stomped across the floor downstairs, and the front door crashed open. Kincaid cracked the window to the room to catch the volume of voices in the street below. They were frustrated by their empty catch, and if they knew how close they were to surprising the pair, they’d be outraged. Words rose with passion and settled in firm tones of command. The patrols split up to search the surrounding block. Whoever gave the church their tip must be a reliable source. They weren’t giving up, and he wasn’t going to get far with the patrol hunting for Sholeh in the Outer City. A trip back to the Inner City and the hecaerae was pointless. He wasn’t one of them and would never fit their mold. Their rejection was clear enough for even the dense to understand, and he doubted any of them could fix what Bartalan had done. Kincaid flopped back on his mattress and threw his hands behind his head. Old straw scratched the back of his hands and dug into the tender skin on his neck. The wood grain in the ceiling planks caught his eye. He stood up and traced his fingertips along the boards. None of this work was quality carpentry, but the wood still spoke to his heart. His mind probed the depths of the lumber and found designs. Even the lowest quality lumber could create art in his hands. His heart slowed as the mind of a carpentry master took over. His soul listened to the story the wood spoke to him. Without thinking about his hands, they reached to his belt and fumbled for tools he lost months ago. Kincaid needed to carve. He longed for an outlet for his mind, and his fingers twitched as he waited. His shortsword was worthless for carving, and the blade wasn’t sharp enough for fine work. But his eating knife was a different story. He slipped the knife out of its sheath. Kincaid fumbled in his pack for the whetstone Adelaise gave him to use to keep his weapons prepared on the journey. Sholeh showed him the art of honing a blade's edge without marring the blade or removing too much steel. With a splash, he wet the stone and shaped the edge of his knife. It was a low-quality tool without the sharpness or balance of a proper carving blade, but he could work the wood's coarse grain. The best piece he could find was from the post of his bed. With a crack, he separated the leg and placed the chunk in his lap. His fingers traced the lines, and his mind probed within the length to find the design. Kincaid’s hand went to work. White piles of tinder grew in piles on the floor, and Kincaid’s mind kept working. His hands stopped in mid-carving. His mind still found art within the grain of wood. Sholeh thought that was the beginning of his magic. Blood pounded and dulled Kincaid’s hearing as energy surged through his torso. He set the knife and the rudimentary carving to the side. He pulled a deep breath in. With his eyes closed, he reached out for the sense of the arcane plane. He found it out of reach. He wasn’t separated, just out of touch with the power. Bartalan was powerful, but he couldn’t sever the ties any more than he could erase the knowledge in Kincaid’s mind. Magi and hecaerae. Just magi. Kincaid pulled his legs into his chest and wrapped his arms around his shins. The arcane plane was there. Like when he touched wood and let it flow, the magic was at his fingertips. Close enough to touch it. Close enough to channel its power. But the magic wouldn’t respond. No, couldn’t answer. Bartalan did something or was still doing something to block him. He felt like he was in chains, unable to reach for the arcane plane. Chains. Arcane chains. Kincaid looked at his hands as if seeing them for the first time. He smiled and closed his eyes again. Chains indeed. Ignoring his soul’s lust for arcane power, Kincaid turned toward the stolen soul. He sensed the unique presence floating within him. If he sacrificed this soul to shatter the chains… Kincaid focused on the pathways and flows to the arcane plane. His mind probed and prodded the resistance. For the first time, he felt the opposition push back. Bartalan controlled the flow of magic and prevented him from touching it. Kincaid’s eyes fluttered open in the ramshackle room, carving forgotten next to his lopsided bed. The opposition wasn’t an insurmountable wall. He wrestled to control his breathing and closed his eyes again. He imagined the soul as a weapon in his hands, a heavy blade of purest power—the power of human life. His mind wielded the sword and attacked the barrier separating him from the arcane plane. A crack of thunder and a powerful blast ripped through his soul as magic rippled across his body. Only he heard the sound in a reality beyond normal senses. Wizards throughout the city would understand something happened, but the unattuned would never feel the change to the world. They’d never guess the power that emerged from the collision. With a thought, Kincaid summoned a torrent of arcane power into his soul. The energy responded with a howl of glory. With another twist, Kincaid closed off the power. He didn’t want Bartalan to find him. Kincaid had to find Sholeh. Time to create some new options.",

      "title": "Kincaid – Darkness and Hope",
      "content": "Kincaid – Darkness and Hope Bartalan’s smirk wouldn’t leave Kincaid’s mind. The memories of the fist impacting his face were enough to keep Kincaid in constant motion. The students who stood by and let him lose were also responsible. They were complicit. Magic seeped into his soul past his defenses, and the room lit with his coursing power. Kincaid tightened the flow and returned to his planning. Kincaid worried about Sholeh, but he had to do something about their predicament. If the hecaerae came looking for him, he needed to be prepared. His planning and preparation were also necessary to help his friends. Would the hecaerae even look for him? With the powers of magic concentrated in the schools, would any of them notice his magic’s return? The image of the wave of energy as he severed the chains removed the doubt from his mind. When Bartalan came looking for him, he needed to be prepared. Kincaid devised a way to prepare, but doubts wracked his conscience. The sensations of right and wrong gnawed at his mental plan. His feet paused at the entrance to the hospital as he considered his options. The simple building was a beacon of hope for the afflicted in the Outer City. Inside this structure was a religious order dedicated to dignity and faith. Doctors and surgeons tended to the powerful and the rich, and the poor longed for someone who cared. Religious orders were different than the massive cathedrals and their patriarchs. The church reflected the Empire’s need to expand its influence and gather wealth. Kincaid doubted the patriarchs came out of their religious palaces to visit the people of Pilaetium. Instead, the religious orders offered a simple life to men and women who couldn’t make their way through the church hierarchy. For many who would not work a trade or master a craft for the guild, the church’s orders stood with open arms. The hospital in the Outer City was one place where the religious orders offered hope to the downtrodden. Pilaetium grew with expanding wealth and left many families behind in poverty. The wealthy of the upper cities could afford surgeons and expensive medical care for their families and close associates. The hospitals run by the religious orders were all the Outer City could offer. The religious order offered basic medical care to all. The brothers and sisters who worked the ward floors had compassion instead of significant medical knowledge. But for many ailments, this was enough to get people through. All hoped a volunteer surgeon would be available if they came to the hospital, but the chances were often too small. The religious order kept hope alive with minimal funds needed from the greater church. People from the Outer City moved in and out of the building. Immigrants came and went, and Kincaid stood motionless, staring at the entrance. The building was a stout structure, three stories high. The bottom floor had several massive double-door gates and broad windows over five feet tall. The floors above the ground looked newer than the bottom floor. The stone color didn’t match the bottom structure, and the windows were smaller and shuttered. Kincaid guessed the ground floor was once an Outer City stable, and the hospital sat on top of the structure. At one end of the bottom floor, the windows were stained glass, and Kincaid assumed this was the original chapel for the religious order's chapterhouse. With his dark plan brewing within his belly, Kincaid turned away from the pure and holy. He pulled in his breath and let it out through his nose. Relaxing his fists into open hands by wiggling his fingers, Kincaid then moved into the public square. Out of the shadows and into the light. The clinic's reception area was busy as a half-dozen of the religious order tended to the sick looking for admission. The order wore the city's colorful garb like the rest, but these were not the fine cuts and expensive materials of the wealthy. Most wore simple wool outfits with a deep maroon tunic. Felt boots moved silently on the packed earth floor. Kincaid nodded at the attendants and avoided the gathering of the sick. He slipped past the entry area to the long corridor behind the administration desk. Kincaid held his breath for a moment, waiting for a challenge to his movement. None came. As he suspected, the bottom floor was a converted stable. The examination rooms were old stalls, and simple woodworking defined the inner walls. The glow of candles from the chapel lit the way to the peaceful words echoing down the hallway. Kincaid turned in the middle of the building as he found a wooden staircase. The construction here was new, nothing like the thick stones of the stables. The hospital must have several benefactors to expand this fast. In addition to the new stairs, Kincaid admired a pulley system attached to a wooden platform. He assumed it was sturdy enough to allow several beds to be raised or lowered between the floors—simple but effective design. “Better than stairs, and it allows us to move patients without disturbing them, brother. Design and construction as thanks from the carpentry guild.” The voice had the melodic tone of a lecturer. Kincaid turned to see an elder brother standing in his worn clothes with hands clutched in front of his belly. The first thing Kincaid noticed was the broad smile lighting the man’s face. The smile defined his age far more than his bald head and stooped posture. “I was a carpenter, once.” Kincaid ran his hands along the wooden machine. Stout wood crafted to stand the challenge of time and the friction of the mechanics. “I did not believe the art of carpentry was something a person could forget.” “No, brother, it isn’t. But the guilds of Pilaetium aren’t the easiest to work with. Especially as an outsider.” “Perhaps some time in the chapel to ease a weary soul?” If he only knew, Kincaid thought. “I’d like to visit your sickest ward. Those that may not make it through.” The brother smiled and nodded. “A chance to see those who need more than you. Lives at the very end is a humbling experience. Another good choice, brother. Upstairs, two floors.” The pair mounted the stairs and wound their way upwards. Kincaid peered at the second floor and noted the smaller hallway and longer rooms. Open wards for the ill filled this floor, but families and friends moved up and down the hall as the religious orders managed their rounds. The third floor was quiet, and Kincaid noted one half was unfinished except for floors and ceiling. The other half made long wards with beds placed next to each other. Efficient for hospital construction. Only the religious order in their felt boots paced up and down this hallway. Wool robes swished as they worked this floor. Moans occasionally echoed in the hall, and whispers soon followed. Kincaid’s skin crawled as he considered this floor. “The first visit is challenging. Even the brothers and sisters working here are blessed with the patience to work with the dying. Not all of us can do this.” He gave Kincaid a knowing gaze as they came to a stop. “I belong here. If even for a few moments. Thank you, brother.” “You should consider the chapel after this floor. It does the soul good to have the weights lifted.” Kincaid nodded and turned back to the hallway. He noted eight to ten attendants, both men and women, working the wards. The ones near him made eye contact, nodded, and then went on with their work. None bothered with extra words or shared feelings. The ward to Kincaid’s left was a long room, some thirty feet long. Simple beds stood a few feet apart. Patients lay sick, weak, and dying. Some laid with eyes closed; others watched the ceiling as their sickness claimed them. Kincaid’s feet didn’t want to take him forward. A frail woman with thin black hair rolled toward him and gave him a weak smile. He found the courage to move toward her. “Good afternoon.” The woman only smiled as Kincaid pulled up a stool and sat next to her. Her touch was dry like sandpaper as disease ravaged her body. Deep rings circled her eyes as she fought to stay awake. “Thank you.” Her voice was a whisper, and Kincaid leaned in close to listen. She didn’t have more words to share, her energy depleted. “Please don’t thank me,” Kincaid whispered back. “Just a man trying to help.” She patted his hand as if she was helping him. Tears welled in Kincaid’s eyes. He’d start here. “Have you imagined the stars since you’ve been here? The lights from so far beyond. The outside.” The woman shook her head. “Imagine with me. Feel your soul reaching out to those stars. Reach for your peace. Settle your mind.” Kincaid felt the first touch of magic in her soul, barely a trickle. Enough, though. With a gentle pull, he laid the woman to rest in her bed. The exhaustion disappeared from her face, and her body relaxed, no longer torn apart by the pain and disease. Kincaid fought back a sob as he sensed the soul next to his own, yet hers was so much smaller. A whisper of its former self. One wouldn’t be enough. He folded the woman’s hands over her chest and adjusted her body so she would appear to be sleeping. His heart raced with the knowledge of what he’d done even as his inner thoughts revolted at what he must continue to do. The ward was quiet as Kincaid continued between the beds while carrying the small stool. He stopped at a younger man’s bed and placed the seat next to this prone figure. Eyes didn’t open as Kincaid brushed his fingertips along the back of the youth’s hand. Kincaid leaned forward and whispered in the man’s ear and kept his contact with the youth’s hands. Not even a sparkle of magic to be found in this man. Kincaid watched the sister of the order make a round and provide comfort for the awake ones. He moved away from the unconscious youth and tested his theory further down the line of the ward. He stopped at another man’s bed. This one was also an immigrant, probably from one of the northern states with his thick, blond beard and pale skin. He rolled his head toward Kincaid and then turned back without interest. “Didn’t think it would end here?” The man turned to Kincaid and looked him in the eyes. “No. Adventure and fame brought me here. Fever will bring me down.” “Just fever?” The man shook his head and pulled the blanket back to reveal his injury on his leg. The rotten smell overwhelmed Kincaid and rocked him back in his stool. “Worse.” “They could take your leg, keep you alive.” “Already spread. Too late for me.” “Your homeland is far from here. Imagine that place for a moment. Is there anyone you want me to give a message to?” The man shook his head and laid back. Covering his leg, he then closed his eyes and slowed his breathing. “Imagine the place where you grew up. When your strength was wild and strong.” Kincaid laid his hand on the man’s arm. Fever coursed through the man’s body, and he touched the single stream of magic flowing through the man’s soul. “Those moments in the sun… feel them now?” The soul separated from the man’s body and joined Kincaid’s collection of souls. Kincaid blinked away the tears as the body relaxed into the bed. Kincaid crossed his arms and let the body take the image of peace. “This was always a tough one, brother. You have a gift for putting them at peace.” Kincaid jumped and dropped the hand. He spun back to the sister smiling down at him. “Not a gift. I think this one passed to the next world. He told me about his wound and his fever.” “Came too late for the surgeons to operate and maybe save his life. But you were with him at his end. Thank you. We can’t help all of them and be with them as they pass to the next life.” “They lay here to die…” Kincaid wasn’t sure if he was asking a question or making a statement. He wanted to hear something from the sister. An accusation or relief for his soul would be better than her calm. “In dignity, yes. The ones we can’t help come to the third floor. The ones that can’t afford more care find their last visit here. We don’t judge.” “I can see that. I wonder how we will be judged for letting them die in this way.” “We do not see the souls of people, brother. We can only judge by their actions.” “I can’t stay any longer. I wish I could do more, but this is so much for me today.” “We completely understand. You’ve stayed longer than most of our order does, and you have nothing to be ashamed of.” If you only knew, Kincaid thought. The faint souls swirled in his consciousness. The ends can’t justify the means. And that was why his soul revolted at his actions. He left the hospital thinking of how he had to address the challenges with Bartalan.",

      "title": "Sigurd - No Honor Among Thieves",
      "content": "Sigurd - No Honor Among Thieves Sigurd tested the tension on his massive bow. The eight-foot piece of ash creaked with the latent power harnessed by the string. He looked over each arrow to check the feathers and take one last look for curves. He discarded two more arrows for no reason other than they didn’t feel right. Eight arrows left in his quiver. With good shots, he could clean up the area around the docks. He drew his long blade from across his back. He’d blacken the sword if he was carrying it bare, but he didn’t want charcoal in his sheath. It’d have to do if he needed the reach of the blade against several opponents. At his hip, the dirk was a faithful companion, loose and ready for a quick draw at close quarters. Adelaise didn’t have the nervous patterns of superstitious warriors. She’d checked her gear once and then sat quietly—no polishing, no whispered words, no good luck charms, no fidgeting. A woman confident in her equipment and her skills. Sigurd was envious because he knew what waited for them. Their plan was the best kind: simple. They’d approach the docks and then climb to find a vantage point over the warehouse. From range, Sigurd could hit the closest patrol and then move inside with enough speed and stealth to surprise the guards on the catwalk. Sigurd had to make each shot count, or this would be his last assault. He’d had his last chance to change his mind hours ago. The young man was already in motion. Action, even on a sketchy plan, was always better than hours plotting the smallest detail. No plan survived the first blows with the enemy. Why waste time? Both decided against donning armor. A stray blow or arrow would be bad, but stealth and speed were more important than protection against a random act. Dark clothes, faces greased black, and charcoaled arms were enough to fade into the shadows. The guards would have to identify their targets. Everyone was a target of the invading pair. Their path kept them off the major roads, preferring alleys and sidestreets to make their way to the docks. People in this part of town ignored the dark deeds of the Outer City. Life was longer if people overlooked the illicit dealings. Sigurd and Adelaise didn’t leave a wake in their passing. The warehouse was in an advantageous spot. No one could approach the building across the square without notice. When the guards put up the alarm, they’d be overwhelmed and captured. What happened after that was farther than Sigurd wanted to envision. They shared a sip from a waterskin Sigurd brought for the waiting. She raised an eyebrow when she pulled back a slug. “I didn’t think you drank water.” “Only when the time is right. We will have time for celebration later, yes?” “How many guards do you count?” “One on the rooftop watching the approaches to the building and two walking patrol.” “Same. Think we can avoid the foot patrol?” “For Sigurd the thief, yes. But we must take them out before we go in. Don’t want to leave warriors behind us when it goes wrong inside.” “Take them with the bow?” Sigurd licked his fingers and felt the wind. He gauged the range to the rooftop and the path the sentries took in the square below. Ripples in their cloaks gave away the velocity and strength of the wind below him, but he couldn’t be sure. “On the roof, yes. The patrol, maybe. Have to put both arrows in flight to have them land close together in time.” “Got a better plan?” “You are the captain. Should be your plan.” “Ex-captain. I’m fired, remember?” Sigurd snorted. “Come, we will do this.” He selected three arrows from his quiver and placed them in front of him. He looked at the smoke streaming from the surrounding chimneys to check the wind. He gauged the target’s pace as the guard made the rounds on the rooftop. Sigurd would wait until the sentry turned the corner and walked the edge of the roof toward their position. Shoulders flexed as the bow creaked its resistance. Fingers brushed against his cheek. Eyes focused on the target and watched the pace of the steps. One more adjustment for wind and elevation. Release. The dark arrow leaped from the string and arced through the night. The target continued his pace into the path of the falling arrow. Sigurd held his breath until the victim fell backward and crumpled to the rooftop. No more movement. “How far was that shot?” “Less than one hundred yards. Shooting downward helps. Two will be harder.” “Let me help with the odds.” Without another word, Adelaise turned and moved down the steps from their perch. Sigurd glanced at his pair of selected arrows and the departing figure. He fit the first arrow to the bow and positioned the second arrow in his hand. The patrol came into sight at a leisurely pace. The docks were quiet this time of night, and the few drunks who meandered nearby were quickly put back on their path. No one would attack the secret headquarters of a powerful organization. Adelaise stepped out of the shadows and weaved her way toward the pair of guards. Their pace shifted to a deliberate walk as they confronted an armed person. As they came to a halt, one raised a hand with an open palm to stop Adelaise. Sigurd put the first arrow in flight. She’d got the pair to stop about thirty yards away. Sigurd had the string back to his cheek with the first arrow already in flight and made the minor corrections for the second shot and released. The time of flight was shorter for this shot. The first arrow slammed into the first guard’s chest, hurling him backward in a fountain of blood. No armor on these guards. The second guard turned to see what happened to his partner. That motion was enough to throw off Sigurd’s original aim. Instead of a lethal shot, the arrow impacted the man’s side and dropped him to his knees. Disbelieving eyes looked at the wooden shaft sprouting from his body. He didn’t have time to register the shock of the pain before Adelaise drew her dagger and finished the work. Sigurd met up with Adelaise at the door to the warehouse. “Ready to go in?” Sigurd nodded and lowered his bow to allow him to fit through the entrance. “Remember to look up. Call out the targets for me.” The young northerner drew back his foot and slammed it into the door. The frame splintered from the blow, and the lock separated from the impact. The ring of broken metal skittered across the floor. Up and to the right, look. Sigurd’s eyes caught a figure leaning forward to look toward the door. Draw, shoot. He picked the next arrow and fitted it to his weapon. A grunt and a crash as the first target fell. Further left. Draw, shoot. The arrow tore across the distance between the bow and the target. The next arrow was on his bow as the pair pushed toward the maze of boxes leading to the central blockhouse. Another crash with an impact. “Other side, single archer. Drawing, move!” Sigurd kept his feet in motion as he sprinted to the boxes. Adelaise was already there. Wood splintered as the missile slammed into the boxes next to them. Sigurd took two steps back and saw the target already fitting another arrow to the compound bow. Too late. Sigurd smiled. Draw, release. The arrow found its target and did its work. “Keep going. Get through the boxes. Can’t let them escape.” Sigurd gave the hoarse whisper for his command. The pair navigated the narrow alley. Adelaise had both weapons out and probed into each corner with her blades before she continued the advance. Sigurd questioned keeping his bow handy in the confined spaces. But he expected another archer in the rafters. He couldn’t find them. Adelaise stopped at the edge of the maze of boxes and peered left and right. She motioned Sigurd to continue as they moved toward the blockhouse entrance. If they secured the door, they’d need siege weapons to get in. Adelaise reached for the handle and squeezed it. The latch clicked, and the exit opened for her. Her reflexes saved her life. A crossbow bolt flew out and punched through the boxes in the warehouse. Had she been standing in front of the door, her last day would be today. Sigurd didn’t wait for the next shot. He pulled and sent an arrow back inside with blind desperation. Enough to make a guard think twice before trying another chance. No grunt or crash from a body. The northerner threw his bow to the side and pulled his dirk out. With a glance toward Adelaise, they surged into the entry room. Each picked a direction and kept moving in case there was more than one archer. The room was still lit, and Sigurd saw one of the northern bodyguards throw aside the crossbow. Steel appeared in his hands. Another blade was drawn as the second bodyguard smiled at the pair. The spear from the third bodyguard dropped to the ready position. Where was the fourth? Sigurd didn’t have time to think about anything other than his fight at hand. Blades clashed, and the skilled warriors didn’t trade quips or threats. Their language was the violence of their blows, and this time the fight would be lethal. Adelaise moved with skill and speed. Her blades flashed high and low, and one northerner was down on his knees, looking at the entrails spilling from his gut. Before he could look back up, her boot kicked him backward. Sigurd was good with his dirk, and the blows that came his way deflected away from his body. The ex-captain didn’t pause in her assault on the bodyguard with the spear. With a flick, she knocked aside the spear and stepped within its reach. The warrior dropped his weapon. He reached for a curved blade and swung to keep her at bay. The dagger had no chance against Adelaise’s skill with weapons, and the mercenary captain dispatched him as quickly as the first. The bleeding body fell to the floor. Against two opponents, the last bodyguard had no chance, but he’d seen their ability to dispatch the others. He didn’t expect quarter and made no move to surrender. His blows were furious and fast to land a lucky shot. Luck was not on his side. Even if it were, it wouldn’t have been enough to save him. Adelaise landed the decisive blow with a slash across his hamstring. Dropping to his knees, it was a moment before the captain’s lethal blow finished the work. Sigurd spun toward the inner chambers and ignored the blood and gore behind him. He drew his long blade and returned the dirk to its sheath. The door leading inwards was ajar, and Sigurd peered through the crack into the light. Adelaise was close and ready to follow him into the office. The pair surged in even as Sigurd expected a crossbow shot to his gut. The wealth was intact, but the place was empty. “No.” “Sigurd, we can’t stay.” “We must search the warehouse.” “There won’t be time. When word gets out about this attack, we won’t be facing a few swords and bows. We’ll have an angry army chasing us. You know the watch will stand aside and let this die out on its own.” Sigurd kicked the carpets and pulled aside several tapestries. The action didn’t make him feel better. He knew Adelaise was right. A perfect attack on limited intelligence. The result was a failure. Worse, Sigurd would be a hunted man.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Meeting",
      "content": "Kincaid - Meeting Kincaid went back to the hospital three more times. He hoped the order wouldn’t become suspicious with every visit leaving bodies in his wake. The angel of death. Kincaid deserved it. Faint spirits swirled at the edge of his mind and brushed his soul. They were quiet, like shadows. Kincaid refused to touch the arcane plane and give away his location, even though his heart longed for the power, and his mind craved revenge. He couldn’t afford to burn through his limited reserve. His reserve. Kincaid marveled at how he justified his horrific actions. He ended lives with a touch of power, and he called the stolen souls his reserve. His conscience justified the act as a mercy for those who would not survive, but the morality was the same. He couldn’t afford to beat himself up over the decisions he’d already made. Kincaid had to find Sholeh, and they had to defend against a vengeful Bartalan. With the chains broken, Kincaid expected the hecaerae to hunt him. At the least, the schools would question the shockwave of magic. Kincaid wouldn’t be retaken. He wouldn’t allow separation from the arcane plane. With his new determination, Kincaid set out to the docks. Immigrants could blend in with the flow of trade and traffic, and fewer people asked questions about a person’s past, given most individuals' transient status. “Ever wish we could afford to travel via ship instead of the caravan?” The voice was right behind him, and Kincaid relaxed with the familiarity. “Often. But I wonder if it would have made any difference with the outcome.” Kincaid turned toward Sholeh and reached out for her hand. She grabbed it and pulled close to him. Her warm hug pushed aside his doubts and fears. But they couldn’t stand by the row of ships like this. Kincaid led her away from the water to keep anyone from pinpointing their position. “We should not have come here.” “This was our point in case we got separated.” He tried his smile. The sad look wouldn’t leave her eyes. “Not what I meant.” Kincaid nodded. “I didn’t know about your past with the city.” “Not so much the past, but my status with this city made it dangerous.” “The church?” “No. My father. He is a patriarch of the church and uses his influence to increase his power. I left to find my way, Kincaid. Being back has been very hard. My father is hunting me.” “I learned from the students of magic. But now I have to do something about it.” “No, just leave.” “Without Sigurd and Adelaise?” Sholeh stopped and turned to face him. She paused as she looked into his eyes. Kincaid knew the fires of his emotions guided him to paths they didn’t expect. This woman had already followed him through the darkest places in the world. He was asking for more. “We should get them. Take them with us.” Her voice was just above a whisper. Her bonds of loyalty ran deep. “We can ask them to join us. But we should ask.” He softened the blow, but he wanted her to know they would leave this place. “Do we have someplace to stay?” “Terrible place. I rented a room away from inns, bars, and common rooms. Too many people can report us.” Kincaid nodded. “We just have to stay on the lookout for Sigurd and Adelaise.” “Then what?” They walked the docks and then the side streets with no destination in mind. Their challenges were as unstoppable as the relentless tide. The best Kincaid could hope for is to ride the wave and keep floating. “I have to face Bartalan.” “Destroy the city?” “I’d prefer not to do that again. But he’ll find me, and he’ll demand to learn what I know.” “After what happened, you will face him again?” She stopped and looked him in the eyes. “By all that is holy, what have you done?” “What I had to do.” She dropped his hand and turned away. Her footsteps were measured and sure, and Kincaid didn’t have the strength to follow her down the street. Her departure caused the souls to stir within him, their loss magnifying his own. He leaned against the side of a nearby building for a moment, hoping she would look back one more time. Any glance would be a sign of redemption. But she headed toward the docks and didn’t look back in his direction. Betrayal. He’d been betrayed so many times in their journeys. Now he was the instigator.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Heirloom",
      "content": "Adelaise - Heirloom Their escape was clean. The bodies they left behind wouldn’t tell tales of the attack, and the gore from the corpses was the only marker of the violent destruction of the covert headquarters. A bar near the warehouse was a dangerous place to recover, and Sigurd wasn’t interested in a drink. That worried Adelaise. “Do you think they’ll figure out who attacked the headquarters, Sigurd?” The young northerner pounded the wall with his fist. They’d procured a room for the night, and their funds were healthy after stealing loose coins and jewels from their raid. “Why are you called Adelaise the Red?” “It’s a nickname I’ve earned over the years. When my weapons come free, I will always draw blood.” “Not the clothes?” “I picked up the clothes after the nickname settled in my first years on the road as a mercenary. Around a campfire, I tell stories about not seeing the blood dry on my clothes. It’s fun to hear people warn about the warrior in red.” “They use other words than warrior.” “No doubt.” “Why did you help me tonight?” “I have nothing left to lose. Sholeh is in trouble with the church, and thieves hunt you. I’m caught either way.” “But you didn’t have to put your life on the line.” “I’m a mercenary. That’s what I do.” “For money, yes?” “And for all the honor among thieves, what did you receive in return?” Sigurd nodded and turned away. “Things are moving fast now, Sigurd. I need your help. I can’t leave the city again without what I came back here for.” The young man raised his eyebrow and sat down on the straw pallet. He grimaced as the old straw poked into his clothes and scraped his skin. “What are you here for?” “Something of my family was taken from me.” “Ah, wealth. I am good with stealing from merchants.” “Isn’t that how you got in trouble with the thieves? Not being good with the merchant?” “Just once. Normally, the merchants learn to fear me.” “I need your help, but it’s not with merchants.” Sigurd stifled his witty reply and waited for her to continue. “A spymaster has something of mine.” “A spymaster could be bad. Kill him instead?” “That didn’t work out tonight with your thieves. I’d rather avoid another failed assault, and the fewer bodies, the better.” “What does this spymaster have?” “The sigil of my family.” “I do not know this word, sigil. What does it mean?” “It is the seal of my family. It allows the bearer to sign legal documents.” “What is legal?” “It means they would hold up with a barrister in court.” Sigurd raised an eyebrow. “Never mind. It’s important to me because it’s part of my family.” “So, we steal the seegeel from the spymaster.” “Sigil. It’s on the hilt of my family blade.” “Your seegeel is a sword?” “The sigil. Sigil. It’s part of the hilt of the weapon. If we can get it back…” “We can do it. When?” “Tonight. If the thieves, church, and whatever Kincaid is doing stack up, we are done.” “I do not know this place for this spymaster—” “I do. And he will be at his normal place in the Inner City waiting for more information and contacts. But his house is in the Middle City.” Sigurd nodded his agreement, and Adelaise felt the weight lift from her heart. She could have a chance at this tonight. “How far?” “We can be there in an hour.” “We will need time to look over the patrols and defenses.” “It’s not a castle, Sigurd.” “But you said no bodies. No bodies mean we must avoid the guards.” Sigurd lifted himself from the straw and dusted off the back of his legs. “Just blades, yes?” “If we need more than our blades, we are already done.” With practiced care, Sigurd unstrung the bow and wrapped the ash length in oilskin. He checked his last four arrows and placed them aside in his quiver. Loosening the blades in their sheaths, Sigurd nodded to Adelaise. The pair set off into the darkness of the night to finish their task. Adelaise and Sigurd stopped in the Middle City in a wealthy merchant-class housing block. The structures were on a hill overlooking the straights that provided the strategic positioning of the city. Each house stood separate from the others and ranged from two to four stories. Adelaise had been to this district only a few times since her work as a mercenary captain, but she remembered the servants working the mansions, the wealth without the Inner City's power struggle, and the parade of discrete guests. Her spymaster wasn’t a man who wanted to entertain guests at home. He preferred to keep his business away from his dwelling. In this neighborhood, the city watch acted as a personal guard due to the residents' extra pay. Travelers that didn’t belong were escorted quickly away from the area. The night patrol would be no different than the efforts during the day. The watch would likely use more force. Unlike the city's wealthiest sections, these houses didn’t have high fences or walls with battlements. The low walls kept most people at bay but not enough to slow a determined assault. Adelaise zeroed them in on the single dwelling. She remembered the night a year ago where she followed the spymaster back to his residence. The drinking had been too much, and the desire to return her blade pumped in her veins. Discretion wasn’t her forte that night. She also wouldn’t forget getting caught. The three-story structure wasn’t the largest or the tallest in the block. It stood out to Adelaise because it didn’t stand out amongst the others. The decorations were in line with its neighbors, the paint was fresh and straightforward, the walls were the same height, and even the bars on the first-floor windows were the same as the neighborhood. Nothing stood out. “You are sure.” His voice didn’t veil his skepticism. “Yes, this is the one.” She looked at the flickering lights at regular intervals along the street. Stealth was impossible without shadows to cover their advance. “Watch is busy along these streets, yes? Never seen so much activity for them at night.” “Paid well by the residents, Sigurd. I wouldn’t try bribing any of them.” “Makes the job harder. Still, no bodies?” “If we can help it, no.” The pair moved along the edge of the block, watching the people and searching for patterns. Adelaise’s frustration grew as they couldn’t find anything to use for their effort. Sigurd didn’t share the same frustration. Maybe he didn’t know better. On their last lap around the block, the watch was nowhere to be found. Sigurd made his way across the street and moved straight to the gated entrance as Adelaise struggled to match his stride. He crouched down and worked the lock with tools from his belt. In a moment, the lock clicked. He looked back and smiled, “Sigurd the thief, perhaps you have heard of me?” The pair slipped inside the walls through the gate and secured the entrance behind them. “How do we get out?” “I am hoping the same way we came in.” “You locked it.” “The watch checks them. An unsecured entrance means they will come knocking and looking. We don’t want them paying attention here.” Adelaise glanced around the small garden and manicured lawn. Servants must work tirelessly on this part of the house. Flowers bloomed in the winter months, and the grass looked like a carpet, so different than the arid conditions of Pilaetium. A running fountain showed off the owner's wealth and provided the means to keep the plant life alive. Sigurd took a lap around the building and noted the single door on the first floor. The third floor had a balcony with another entrance, but they’d be exposed to people on the street if they broke in there. “Only one door is good.” “Too easy to defend, Sigurd.” “Defend yes, but also means many people have keys to this door. Traffic means it is hard to trap. Good for us tonight.” “As long as it isn’t guarded.” “The building has guards?” “I don’t know. Not like I’m a regular guest.” Sigurd shook his head and crouched to get to his work on the door. He muttered a few swear words as his fingers probed the inner workings, and his ears hunted for clues to the lock. With another mechanical click, the latch gave way to his skill. The pair slipped inside, and Sigurd closed the entrance behind him. He used a shim of metal to prevent the lock from engaging into the frame. “Our only option for escape. Do not lock ourselves in, yes?” Adelaise smiled and looked toward the grand staircase leading upwards. The spiral stairs were a broad structure of perfect stone and crafted railings of marble. A golden statue of an eagle snatching a fish from water guarded the lowest landing. A single lamp illuminated the staircase, and the light played across the golden feathers of the statue. The ex-captain led them upstairs to the second floor. The soft soles of their boots made little sound as they worked their way up the marble stairs. The second floor was carpeted with wealth from around the world. The spymaster had simple tastes, but the choices were elegant. The carpet here was clean and showed only a few servants worked on this floor. Their fast pace carried no sound from the plush material. Adelaise couldn’t let her guard down. The entrance room to the floor also held the spiral staircase up to the third floor, but the waiting area was broad and open. The fireplace was cold. A thrifty measure for a master always busy at night. Adelaise led them to the right into a study. Windows provided openings for moonlight to trickle into this room. The pale blue light revealed bookshelves covering the walls from floor to fifteen-foot ceilings. Scrolls, parchments, and books carefully lined each shelf, covered the desks, and even lay on the seats' cushions. The room was impressive, even for a man of wealth. Sigurd and Adelaise strolled into the room and looked upon its wonders. “What does he do with all of the paper?” Adelaise looked up at her companion. “I would imagine he reads it.” “All of it?” He looked around the room. “Who has the time for this?” “Look carefully. This is where he displays his wealth. Not the paintings or tapestries. It’s here. This is what he does.” “Writes poems. Not wealth at all.” They started at the bookshelves and searched through the belongings. Adelaise didn’t know what she was looking for. Anything out of place. Books not perfectly flush, dust or lack of dust on a shelf, a passage to a treasure room, a hidden section of a desk to hide great wealth. Something a spymaster… It was on the wall. A display case held a blade that made the one at her hip look like the tool of a pauper. The naked sword held perfect edges, a point to cut through armor, a bell guard of elaborate woven steel, and a pommel with a noble family's seal. She walked straight to the display. “You’ve come for it. I wondered when this day would happen.” Sigurd and Adelaise spun around to the voice. Four people stood at the grand entrance to the library. “And on the same day you attacked the thieves. Quite a way to build your enemies. At least you picked the powerful ones.” “I think our contract is over.” “Of course you would think that. You brought a barbarian friend with a big sword to break into my house and steal my property.” “My property, stolen from me. Part of my family.” “Irrelevant now, I’m afraid. You see, the thieves are already here with me.” He guested to the pair of people next to him. “I’ll get what I need, and you won’t have that blade. It’ll stay part of my collection, and your family will now do as I tell them. Because I’ll sign the paperwork to do so.” Sigurd was on the balls of his feet, his hands and arms ready for action. He waited for Adelaise to make a move toward her weapons. “You left a wake of bodies at the docks, Sigurd. Yes, yes. That’ll take me months to recover the workforce and the wealth. And I’m going to take it out of your hide this time. No patience for this failure, I’m afraid.” The smaller man spoke directly to Sigurd, and Adelaise knew the spymaster and thieves had been in coordination for some time. What she couldn’t figure out is how they were betrayed. “How does this end?” Adelaise asked. “Intruders in my house trying to steal my wealth? Either with your capture and imprisonment or your bodies cleaned up by my servants—\" “Enough talk then.” Sigurd roared into action. His long blade tore from its sheath and reflected the moonlight flowing into the room. The large man behind the head of the thieves drew his longsword and axe from his belt. Another northerner. A youth like Sigurd but with the practiced poise of a blademaster. The spymaster’s bodyguard moved forward in a blur. He threw a knife from his belt and followed with two more from his wrist. Adelaise was already in motion to the side and registered the blades slamming into the books where she once stood. Her blades came free and weaved a wall of steel in front of her. Steel collided against steel to the side as angry male voices roared in the night air. Adelaise and her opponent closed the gap, and the bodyguard was wise to use a pair of daggers. He held them close to his body and looked for openings in Adelaise’s defenses. Not waiting for the fight to develop, Adelaise launched attacks from blade and dagger. She showed no quarter as the attacks flashed out. Blows met only steel as the man stayed in motion with weapons and feet. Adelaise saw the leader of the thieves and even the spymaster draw weapons. None were shy to get their hands dirty. They’d grown up in this business. Adelaise changed her attack pattern and moved to close the gap between her and Sigurd. Her opponent figured out too late that she was fighting to get by Sigurd’s side, and her opponent could not prevent the movement to protect the flanks. But she wasn’t protecting. In a blur, her blade lashed out and slashed across Sigurd’s opponent’s kneecap. The man dropped to the ground and bellowed his pain. It was his last breath as Sigurd drove a foot of steel through his chest. Sigurd nodded his thanks and pressed the attack against the head of the thieves. The heavy blade pushed the man back, but Sigurd wouldn’t leave Adelaise’s side undefended against her two skilled opponents. She couldn’t afford more reckless attacks against the pair. Each one of her blows was measured for the minimum effort to deflect an attack. She hunted for favorite blows and unconscious patterns. The spymaster was probably skilled in his prime as an assassin or low-level thug. But he was out of practice. She could dispatch him first. But her skilled dagger-wielding opponent would make her pay for the distraction. Sigurd made a broad thrust forward and drove his opponent backward in defense. Adelaise barely blocked the attack aimed toward Sigurd’s chest. He pulled back from the line of attack and out of Adelaise’s sight. She was exposed and opened. In a moment, she’d be pressed by three attackers. With their skill, far more than she could handle. Glass broke behind her, and then Sigurd was back. His heavy blade wove a wall of steel as he lunged forward. The weight and ferocity of the attack lacked the poise of a blademaster, but the smaller blades wouldn’t stop the driving force behind the hammering attacks. In his left hand was the blade—the blade of her family. Without looking back, he tossed the sword in her direction. She hurled her old blade at the spymaster in a straight and true throw. She grabbed her family blade out of the air from the toss. The hilt was already warm to the touch and hummed with its own life. It responded to her thoughts with precision and lethality. With Sigurd surging forward to give her a moment, she followed him with a smile hurting the corner of her mouth. The thrown blade caught the spymaster across his arm, and he turned and sprinted toward the spiral staircase. Sigurd and Adelaise fought the remaining pair. The head of the thieves made the first mistake as he misjudged the strength of Sigurd’s blow. The massive sword slammed down and crushed the fruitless defense. Chunks of flesh dangled from where his forearm once hung attached to his body. A knife blade flashed out from Adelaise’s opponent, but she wasn’t the target. Sigurd staggered back as he looked at the hilt of the knife poking out of his chest. Adelaise lunged into the attack and wove deadly steel with speed. The man couldn’t stand up to the assault and gave ground. His eyes flicked to check on Sigurd’s recovery, and that was the last mistake the skilled assassin made. Adelaise’s family sword found his heart through the ribcage. He was dead before his body hit the floor. Without a thought, she cut the throat of the head of thieves and left his bleeding body on the floor. Sigurd was leaning against a bookcase. Books and papers fluttered around him from his weight against the structure. Blood soaked his shirt from the wound, and his breath was shallow and fast. “It was a good throw, yes?” “Perfect, Sigurd. Just perfect.” He glanced at the blade in his chest and said, “His was good, too.” The heavy blade thunked to the carpet at his feet. He grabbed the pommel of the knife and closed his eyes. “Sigurd, wait. We should…” The blade was out with barely a gasp. Sigurd threw the knife to the side and looked at the blood in his hands. The wound bled freely now. “Grab his cloak, yes?” They crafted a makeshift bandage for the wounded northerner. “We need to get out of here, Sigurd. He ran, but he’ll be back with a vengeance and reinforcements.” “Out the way we came, yes?” “Of course.” “Need to be a better thief sometime.”",

      "content": "Sigurd - Next Move “Just a scratch.” “Then stop bleeding down your side,” Adelaise said, offering no sympathy to the wounded northerner. Sigurd held his composure as they left the Middle City gates behind. The alarm hadn’t been raised, and the wound was covered well enough to prevent him from soaking his side in blood. He winced with each step, and he hurt more as the battle rage faded. “Find a bar to hold up, yes?” “How can you think about drinking now?” “Good for wounds.” He winced as he glanced toward Adelaise. “And we need to find Kincaid and Sholeh.” “We do, before the wrath of the spies come down on us.” “How much time?” “Weeks, days, hours. I don’t know what resources he still has at his disposal. If the emperor is interested in our friend…” “Which one?” “Kincaid. He’s the one with magic, remember?” Sigurd leaned over and spit to the side. “The spies sent you to find the blacksmith. But you ended up finding more about Kincaid.” “I know. The spymaster was too engaged in what we were doing. Our group is different from any other I’ve been around.” “A bar?” “We also need to locate our companions.” “I drink, and you can find them.” “Leave you to take on whatever comes our way? Thieves? Spies? Guards?” Sigurd smiled and then clutched his side to hold in the shooting pain as he coughed. “It will be a glorious death.” “I can’t believe I’m going to agree to this.” “The charm of a thief, yes?” “No, the requirement to get us out of this city before the streets erupt.” Adelaise had the kindness to set up a tab for Sigurd at a bar near the docks. The first draft was warm, and the northerner wondered how someone could waste the effort to brew beer and then make it so bad. The captain walked out the door, her stride showing her determination to finish her mission. They had to get everyone back together and head out of the city. Sigurd needed to take care of himself. The choice of this bar wasn’t an accident. Every thief had a safe house with people as reliable as they could be bought, and this was one of those places that let Sigurd pay for anonymity. With the leader of the thieves dead, Sigurd needed time. The guild members would take days to reorganize as the struggle for power among the lieutenants could become violent. In the end, only one would lead the organization, and Sigurd’s small group had to be gone before someone investigated the violence of the evening. Glancing around the bar to check for unusual actions and unnecessary scrutiny, Sigurd caught the attention of one of the servers. She came over with another beer, which he grabbed from her tray. “Room three available now?” The woman’s face changed from the bright smile of service to the serious look of business. “I’ll check.” She went back to the bar and whispered to the barkeep. The man looked over at Sigurd and sized him up from halfway across the room. The barkeep nodded in the northerner’s direction. His wounds were stiff as Sigurd stood up. The blood was drying and caking on his side, and his shirt stuck to his puckered skin. He grabbed the beer in his fist and made his way up the back stairs. This seedy bar had the extra rooms here for business, not long-term stays. Sigurd ignored the passionate sounds from behind closed doors and paused at door three. He leaned in to listen through the wood as old habits were hard to break. With only the rustle of papers from the other side, he pushed the door open and walked in. “Sigurd, my friend. You look like a pile of horse dung.” A frail woman sat at a mismatched table with an oil lamp and several books. She didn’t bother with the flashy colors of robes and the fine material typical to the capital. Instead, she wore sturdy woolen clothes, including pants tucked into boots. Her smile was crooked and genuine. “Some things don’t change, yes?” “I thought you were a thief, Sigurd…” She raised her wispy body from her seat with a sigh and approached the young man. Hands investigated the wet stain on his side, and wrinkles covered her forehead as she analyzed the bloodstain. The woman didn’t come up halfway up Sigurd’s chest. “And a famous warrior.” “Just not a good one, I see.” Fingers probed the torn skin and redness around the wound. “You almost waited too long, my friend.” “Patch me up? I think I will end up in another fight.” “You should win one now and then.” “You should see the bodies of those that won’t come to you.” “Sigurd, you didn’t.” “I’ll be leaving soon. But I can’t bleed out on the street.” The woman turned back to the chest of drawers by the desk. She motioned him to sit down on the straw mattress. “Might as well sit down, so you don’t fall over.” She removed vials and jars from her supplies. Water from a pitcher made its way into a pot over an open flame. Preparations for the wound started as the water began to boil. The woman’s touch was efficient and not gentle. But the salves and jars of fluids made the pain bearable, and the wound responded to her touch. She cleaned, sewed, and patched to make his body whole. The doctor even clucked when she worked on the other injuries from his beating. “I would tell you to wait several weeks to let all of this close and heal. You were lucky to survive this time. Don’t push your luck.” She held up her hand as Sigurd drew his breath. “But I know better, my friend. I wish you weren’t one of my customers.” “Naia, why do you stay here in the docks?” “You’ve never asked me that before. No one does. They just leave better than when they came in here.” “Yes, but you could run a shop in the Middle or even Inner City.” The woman cleaned up her supplies, and her gaze was unfocused as she washed up her hands with the remaining water from the pitcher. “Like you, some of us are trapped by our choices in this town. Some have to make amends for their last pieces of work.” “If it’s the thieves, you can clear your name. There are many bodies to prove it.” “Oh, Sigurd. You are a young fool. Those are the easy bonds, I’m afraid.” Sigurd didn’t pretend to understand what she was saying. He told her what he wanted her to know, and he offered her a chance to escape from this life of patching up sailors, thieves, and terrible warriors. How many others gave her a new opportunity? “I will be leaving.” “You should, my friend.” “It will be tough not coming back to see you.” “Your type always comes back, Sigurd. Your sword and ideas are bigger than your skills.” Sigurd chuckled as he pulled his torn shirt over his head. His muscles protested, but her work was excellent. Shaking her head, Naia handed him a small vial and rolled his fingers over it. “It will keep the infection away because I know you will tear my work up. This will give you a chance.” Sigurd smiled and then leaned down to place a kiss on her forehead. As he walked out, he wondered how long before she told the thieves he’d visited for his wounds. He’d cross that bridge later.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Reunion",
      "content": "Kincaid - Reunion “Adelaise was looking for us.” Sholeh’s tone was curt and formal with Kincaid. He hated what he’d done to her, but Kincaid couldn’t envision another choice right now. “Will they find us?” “I left a message for our location. We will meet tonight.” “Why are you so mad at me?” Sholeh gave him a stare that forced him to glance away. She stepped closer to force him to face her again. “Look at you. You take these risks with your soul for this magic. Can you not see that we do not need it?” “But I have this power that I had to learn and understand—” “Find something that does not cost your soul. Magic brings imprisonment, loss, and death.” “This is my chance to change that. As I accept these powers, I can discover what I can do—” “Yes, you bring death to others.” Kincaid looked at the floor. “Ignoring this power will not change what I have to do.” “What is that?” A gentle rap sounded at the door, and Kincaid jumped to his feet. He was happy for the distraction to answer the knocking. Sholeh glared at him as he made his way to respond. “Good argument, yes?” Sigurd stood with his hand resting on the frame of the door. He carried his pack, bow, and weapons and strode into the room. Adelaise noticed the distance between Sholeh and Kincaid as she entered the room behind Sigurd. Her eyes shot Sholeh a question, and Kincaid couldn’t decipher the response. “Where did you get the blade, Adelaise?” Sholeh couldn’t take her eyes off the weapon. “Good eye, smith.” “Long story, though. Better over a cold beer. Always better for a story.” Sigurd glanced outside the small room and took up a position as a sentry. “We probably shouldn’t be hanging out as a group,” Kincaid said. “Let’s not pinpoint our location in the first few minutes of our gathering. “Then, I will get the beer.” Sigurd ducked his head and walked down the corridor. “The blade is a family weapon.” “May I?” Sholeh handled the weapon as if she was holding an infant. Her fingers touched the elaborate work on the bell and admired the craftsmanship of the blade. “It is beautiful. Beyond the ability of most masters to craft. It is one of a kind.” “It is unique. With the family—” “Seegeel. New word, yes?” Sigurd returned with four beers and put them near the bed. “Sigil, Sigurd, sigil. The family seal is supposed to be impossible to copy. This blade certainly is.” Sholeh flipped over the sword and examined the pommel. “How do you know?” “I was there when it was forged.” With the steel bared in the light of the room, Kincaid’s attention was drawn toward the blade. The craftsmanship had no equal, but the edge had more beyond his normal sight. In the light of the room, the sword seemed to absorb the light around it, creating darkness along its tempered length. “May I?” Kincaid felt the pommel warm immediately to his touch, inviting him to look closer. The blade was perfect in balance and design, but it was the way the steel absorbed the light that took his breath away. For a moment, he summoned a trickle of magic, and the blade glowed with an inner light only he could see. This was impossible. He returned the sword. “Amazing work, Adelaise. Worth getting back, for sure.” “No leverage to hold over me. Now just have to worry about revenge.” “Seems to be a constant in our lives. Someone always wants revenge for their slights. Which is why we have to talk.” Sholeh refused to grab the mug of beer, and Sigurd shrugged his shoulders while bearing a tankard in each hand. He’d drink them both. “Bartalan will come after me.” “I do not know what this bart-a-laan means.” Sigurd took a long drink from Sholeh’s mug. “The students at one of the schools here,” Kincaid avoided the word magic, “have a gathering to practice their arts. Without the knowledge or supervision of their masters. The leader of the group is a dangerous man, Bartalan. He suspects and now probably knows I have some dark secrets. He’ll do whatever it takes to uncover them.” “Killing you doesn’t make sense, then.” Adelaise focused on their discussion. “No, but he’ll come looking.” “By all that is holy, why?” In those few words, Sholeh unleashed her unspent fury. Sigurd and Adelaise backed away from the confrontation. “Because I broke his spell. His darkest secret and most dangerous power—I defeated it. He’ll want to know how and why. We won’t get out of the city easily, and I don’t prefer to leave that kind of enemy behind us.” The others were silent as they considered his words. None of them could disprove his assessment of magic, and his logic to face this wizard was sound. Even if they wanted to escape, they couldn’t avoid someone with this level of power. “Then what do we do, Kincaid?” Adelaise broke the silence. “Pick a battleground of our choosing and issue the challenge.” “Just like that? I don’t mind the plan, and it’s a good one. But how do we get him to walk into our battlefield?” Adelaise asked. “It’ll be my battlefield, and I know Bartalan well enough that he won’t turn down a chance to learn more. He’ll come prepared.” “Then it won’t be your battleground. It’ll be one we look over and prepare for our purposes.” Sholeh and Sigurd nodded with Adelaise’s words. “But it’ll be a challenge between magi and hecaerae—” “That doesn’t mean we can’t do anything,” Adelaise said. “Steel will still cut them down, yes,” Sigurd added. “Not alone. Not again.” Sholeh’s words were quiet. Tears welled up at the corner of Kincaid’s eyes, and his throat was tight. A blacksmith and a friend. More? An ex-mercenary captain with an unusual blade. And a northerner thief and archer. Accompanying an inexperienced magi. It didn’t seem possible. “I don’t know how we can defeat these student hecaerae. They push their abilities to the edge, and even the schools here don’t know all of their abilities. Bartalan will bring along his most loyal companions if we draw him out into a fight.” “You will have your companions as well, yes?” Sholeh fixed her gaze on Kincaid. She expected an answer. “Yes, we will work together to make sure we can all get out of this city alive. We may have many people chasing us away, but we will escape together.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Setting Conditions",
      "content": "Kincaid - Setting Conditions Kincaid worked his way through the line at the Middle Gate. The guards were methodical and focused on each person in line. Sentries asked several travelers to provide the writs for their weapons, and they pulled aside others for more questioning. Everyone faced an unhappy set of guards. “What brings you the Middle City, traveler?” The guard looked Kincaid up and down with a scowl. “A meeting at the School of Damis.” Kincaid tried to flash a disarming smile, but the guard wasn’t interested. “Don’t look like hecaerae or a student. What’s the purpose of visiting the school?” “I’ve been invited. They want to see if I can become a student.” “Hmm, not sure it works that way.” “I’m not sure how else it would work, to be honest. The forces of magic are beyond most of our understanding. Who am I, a simple carpenter, to question what I might do with the arcane forces?” “That may be true, traveler, but the access to the Middle City isn’t guaranteed.” The charm offensive wasn’t working with the guards, and they’d probably heard similar lines all morning. By afternoon, they’d seen it all. So Kincaid straightened his back and dropped the emotion from his face. “Then we should send a runner forward to the school and make sure I can enter. That assumes, of course, that we are willing to make the group of hecaerae wait for me because of administrative purposes at the gate.” “Not sure that is necessary, traveler.” A more senior member of the guard approached the pair. This one was a corporal and someone Kincaid hoped could decide on his entrance. “Let him through. Give him a blue pass.” Kincaid cocked his head to the side and raised his eyebrows. The guard enjoyed his confusion. “Yes, a blue card. Any member of the watch, guard, or local forces can demand you to present your card. It’s only good for one day, and you’ll return it on the way out. No card means a trip to prison. So don’t lose it.” Kincaid grabbed the parchment and made a show of folding it up and placing it within his cloak. He gave the patrol a half-smile and walked past. The line was barely moving this early in the afternoon. The gates weren’t wide open today. If merchants approached with wagons, the patrol gave the goods a thorough search, and paperwork exchanged hands. Then wagons would wait for one of the wide doors to open to allow them in, and then the doors were closed and secured. Foot travel worked through the smaller doors like the one at nightfall. Something rattled the Middle City, and Kincaid had a good guess that his companions were involved. The guards stopped him on the approach to the door and asked to see his paperwork. After he presented his blue card, Kincaid moved through the gate. The scrutiny leaving the gate was the same as coming in. Kincaid didn’t stay long enough to draw attention to his curiosity about entry and exit procedures, but the guard was serious about catching someone at the gate. Regular traffic would take a while to adapt to the process. The line to get into the Inner City was much shorter. People of power and their retinues didn’t wait long for their clearance to enter, and one of the double doors remained open to allow for smooth transit of carriages and horses. Regular pedestrian traffic faced scrutiny. Each person who looked out of place in the Inner City had to present their card. The attention wasn’t on the Inner City, and Kincaid was relieved. He suspected that if he tried his bluff to have the school verify his entrance, these guards would take him up on that request. And then his plan would come apart. The Inner City was active with traffic moving toward the Imperial Palace. Kincaid didn’t have extensive experience in the Inner City, but he hadn’t witnessed this many people making their way to the center of power. If the Emperor was holding court, that would explain the scrutiny. But the Inner City also had a different energy that even a stranger could sense, unusual for a city known for its systematic bureaucracy and legalistic rules. Kincaid took to the side roads to get off the main thoroughfares. He didn’t need stealth to reach his objective, but he also didn’t want a group of prying eyes sending word ahead. Most importantly, he didn’t want to face Bartalan on the school grounds. He wasn’t prepared for that, and he wouldn’t have the advantage of his companions to even any unexpected odds. The gates to Damis were still open, and a single guard stood at the entrance. The woman wore the colors of the school, but the tunic fit her awkwardly. Definitely new and a different twist to his plan of sending a message without getting caught. He didn’t hesitate as he approached. “Good afternoon, I have a message for hecaerae Darya. Is she available?” “How would I know if a particular person is available?” “Perhaps a runner could send a message on my behalf?” “Do you see a runner around here, visitor?” Kincaid looked around the guard into the courtyard of the school. No one made their way between buildings. “I see you are right. Then how am I to get the message to the hecaerae?” “That falls into the ‘not-my-problem’ category.” “Then, I can enter the campus?” The woman looked him up and down with raised eyebrows. “Yes, you can.” Kincaid walked past the guard. What was the point of having a guard if anyone or everyone could get into the area? Too much of the Inner City was about looks and perceptions of power. Below the surface was a rotten core. The Empire existed on a shaky foundation. The magi walked toward the administration building hoping no one noticed the pounding in his chest. If he touched the arcane plane at this distance from the instructors and the students, they’d know exactly who he was. Bartalan and his peers would recognize his purpose. But they couldn’t read minds. At least Kincaid didn’t think so. A flash or two of magic wouldn’t draw more attention here with the experimentation and classroom instruction already going on. Finding Darya without running across Bartalan was a tough challenge. He’d sent word ahead through a paid messenger to let Darya know that he would be coming back to the school. He’d even risked giving a date and an afternoon as part of his plan, even though a captured message could be the end of his stay in Pilaetium. He’d worried for a full day as no response came back. When he found his courage and settled his companions' fears, he set out to make the meeting arrangements. They couldn’t afford to wait longer. As he stood in front of the administration building, he paused. His plan would immediately fail if Bartalan was working at the desk. His feet wouldn’t move closer to the doors. “Kincaid, is that you?” Kincaid turned toward the voice, and his heart dropped to the bottom of his chest. Karli, one of the female students from the study group, stood in her full hecaerae regalia. The best he could do is smile. “I didn’t think you would ever return here after the beating Bartalan gave you. Are you ok?” “I’m healing.” “The magic he used. It could have killed you.” “Oh, I’m made of tougher material than a few channels of magic. He proved his point, though.” “Then why come back?” “Is Darya around?” The concerned look changed to quiet amusement. “Back for a girl?” Kincaid’s cheeks heated past a healthy pink, and he couldn’t keep the stammer out of his voice. “In a way, I guess so.” “Bartalan’s in class. Let me get her, and then you should leave before he sees you again.” “Thank you, Karli.” Kincaid stepped backward, away from the doors. He leaned his back against the stones of the outer wall and stayed in the lengthening afternoon shadows. In a few moments, the sound of hurrying footsteps came from the other side of the building. Two women came around the corner, and Kincaid breathed a sigh of relief they were alone. “Kincaid…” Darya hurried forward and came to a stop in front of him. She changed her mind and threw her arms around him. Kincaid was surprised but then returned the embrace. Darya had a fragrance of fresh flowers, and her warmth flooded his being. He didn’t release her as he looked into her eyes. “You didn’t return my message. I was afraid I would walk up here and be arrested.” “For what? You’ve done nothing against the school.” “But Bartalan—” “Doesn’t have as much influence as you think.” “He certainly has a great deal of power.” Kincaid rubbed the healing bruises on his face. “We shouldn’t stay here, though.” “It was good seeing you, Kincaid.” Karli left them alone as she turned and walked to one of the academic buildings. Kincaid shot the guard a glance as he walked out the gate with the hecaerae. The see-I-told-you-so look was ignored by the guard, and Kincaid kept moving down the street. “There’s so much going on, Kincaid.” “I can imagine. Those of us living down in the Outer City don’t get to hear much. Especially after being thrown into a gutter and left in the sewage.” That was harsher than the magi intended, even if everything was true. Darya worked her mouth and then closed it. Her footsteps became firm as they walked side-by-side. “I’m sorry, Darya. Coming back to the school wasn’t as easy as I thought. When you didn’t answer, I assumed the worst.” “You are right, Kincaid. Bartalan has it out for you, and we all stood by and let him. I don’t have an excuse.” “None required. But I need your help. I need to face Bartalan.” “He’ll kill you.” Kincaid smiled and reached out to hold her hand. The warmth of her touch felt good in his palm, and he gave her a reassuring squeeze. “I don’t plan on giving him that opportunity.” “That wave of magic was you.” Respect glowed in her eyes. “Yes. Desperation can fuel some incredible efforts. I couldn’t let him cut me off from the arcane plane. I won’t let him.” “You should see him, Kincaid. How much he’s aged. The magic is claiming him.” “He’s talked about the consequences of magic. He knows them as well as the rest of us.” “But you look the same, Kincaid. Maybe a few more gray hairs on your head, but nothing like Bartalan.” “He’s the one using his magic for show and then cutting off others from the arcane plane. I figured out that he needed to maintain a flow to isolate someone. He was burning through his life to keep others from living theirs. Not an admirable man.” “But a dangerous one, Kincaid. You should just leave the city.” Her touch felt good. There once was a time in Caesea that he would disappear with her. They’d forget their place in the world. But he didn’t have that luxury now, and Sholeh’s smile crossed his mind. “I have to leave behind the city—” “Agents of the Emperor have been in the schools looking for the red-haired magi.” Kincaid stopped in his tracks and turned to face her. “How does the Emperor know about me? After everything that Bartalan did, I shouldn’t have recovered.” “But you did, and the Emperor is aware of a powerful force of unaligned magic within the heart of his Empire. If you were somewhere else in the Empire, the news would take time to get to us. But you are here, blocks away from the palace.” Lazy guards and slow bureaucracy saved him from imprisonment. He was separated from his companions, and the threat had never been greater in his life. Caesea was a joke compared to what this Empire could do to him. What to do next? His body screamed to run away from all of this. Take their chances on the road and fight their enemies one at a time, if they were found. But his mind fought back with reason. Bartalan wouldn’t let him walk away from this city. He was probably the one who slipped the word to the Empire's agents about what he could do. Passion and reason fought for Kincaid’s soul, even as the power of magic begged for a touch. “I need you to get a message to Bartalan. I need to have a discussion with him. If he brings guards or help, then I will be gone.” “Kincaid, you can’t do this. He’ll kill you for what you know.” “Then he’ll learn nothing from me.” “The school is mad at him, Kincaid. They want to hold a board of inquisition about his behavior. The student group hasn’t formed since he attacked you.” “Interesting, so he has a great deal more to lose—\" “He’s blaming it on you.” “That’s ok. He’s the type who will never face accountability for his own actions. I imagine he’s ready to lead a coup from within the school.” “The grand master and the fifth rank wizards are watching for exactly that. They are noting his collection of friends and people of interest. This doesn’t end well for him.” “I don’t want the school banishing him, and I don’t want the Empire or the hecaerae breathing down my neck.” “Then what will you do?” “I need you to pass a message to my good friend, Bartalan.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Last Chances",
      "content": "Sholeh - Last Chances Coming back to Pilaetium was a mistake. Sholeh looked out the window and fingered the haft of her hammers. Patrols from the watch were double their standard size and armed with mail and heavy weapons. The watch expected trouble. She had to assume their group was part of the reason for the change in operations and readiness. The smith stepped away from the window before her observation brought unnecessary attention. She wished she could explain to Kincaid why coming to the heart of the Empire was a mistake. The magic he’d learned threatened his life again, and she was on the run from the church. Sigurd and Adelaise had their own list of powerful enemies. Taken together, Sholeh was concerned their problems exceeded their challenges in Caesea. She paced the small floor of their room as she waited for Kincaid to return from his trip to the Inner City. Increased security threatened his mission, and a misstep with the hecaerae would force a rescue mission against impossible odds. Everything was wrong about staying in the capital and pushing one last agenda. Her heart was unsettled with their chances of survival. A soft rap at the door caused Sholeh to palm a hammer. Heart pounding through her veins, she stepped to the side. Sholeh cursed herself for her silliness. If someone wanted to ambush her, they wouldn’t knock first. She responded with a low summons but kept the hammer in her hand. She breathed a sigh of relief with the redhead who bobbed into the room. His eyes were bright and energetic as he locked gazes with her. His face lost its youthful softness months ago with his discovery of magic. Instead of dimples and soft cheeks, he wore the hard angles of work, and the concern lines around his eyes were growing deeper. For all his power, magic still demanded a profound toll on the young man. But how young was he now? And how much more would magic ask from him as they undertook this next stage? Sholeh didn’t like how they approached confrontation with another magician. She’d seen enough destruction from the last effort to want to convince her friend to stay away from these wizards. “It’s done.” “By all that is holy, you are sure?” “As sure as I can be without grabbing a gauntlet and slapping him across the face.” “Tell Sigurd and Adelaise?” “Adelaise is clearing the street near the inn to see if anyone tried to follow me, and Sigurd is guarding the main entrance. They know I’m here, and I’m sure they assume I was successful.” Sholeh nodded her acceptance and swallowed hard. “We can still leave. Before it is too late.” Her voice was above a whisper, as if she was afraid to betray the young man’s plans. Foolish thoughts; they’d been over this already. “I just don’t see it that way, Sholeh.” He pulled off his cloak and went to his bed, just a gathering of straw on the creaky wooden floor. Kincaid slid to the floor as the smile evaporated from his face. He winced as he caught a splinter on his back. “We risk people finding us here in town, and you have revealed to a school of wizards what you plan on doing.” Sholeh controlled the volume of her voice. “Sholeh, we’ve been at risk for a long time. Tell me about the church.” Kincaid’s eyes cut through the fog of her deception, and his gaze was unrelenting. “It is a long story, my friend.” “We have some time, and I think we should have this discussion before Sigurd and Adelaise come back.” He raised his hand and gestured toward the other pile of straw. She refused to sit. “You know I left the city, even after I started my apprenticeship with the blacksmiths.” “You told me you had to start over again in Caesea, but you moved up the ranks quickly in your forge. The master there liked your work and saw you could also lead the younger apprentices.” “All very true, but I had to leave Pilaetium for several reasons.” Kincaid leaned forward and dug the splinter out of his backside. He stayed quiet to let her continue. Sholeh pulled in a long breath and blinked hard to keep the memories from overwhelming her emotions. “My father didn’t want me to become a blacksmith.” “What did he expect you to do?” “Marry within the church.” Kincaid sat silently, and Sholeh couldn’t determine if he was stunned with her simple sentence or if he was waiting for more from her. He waited. “The power struggles place high demands on the sons and daughters in the capital. People wear their rank as part of their fashion. Most are prominent with their displays of wealth and fashion. Children are part of their calculus.” “The Northern States doesn’t seem to have that problem.” “Because they spend too much time at war with each other. None of the rulers bother with intricate power struggles like Pilaetium. We make it an art and a game. The Northern States resort to war when things don’t go their way.” “What happens here?” “They wait for another generation to get their revenge. The Empire has grown for over a thousand years, and the Thousand Spears are less important than ever within the city.” “You were a pawn to make your father more powerful?” “Yes.” “What did your mother think?” “She opposed it, of course. My mother raised a strong daughter who was not easily shaped for marital purposes. Steel is strong and deadly in the right hands. I didn’t want to be traded for political favors.” “But pushed in the wrong direction, steel can snap.” Sholeh blinked away the unbidden tears in the corner of her eyes. She wouldn’t cry here over the choices she made long ago. “She helped me get the apprenticeship with the blacksmiths. My father was furious with the contract I signed. And things went worse from there.” “Why does this affect us so much today?” “Because my father knows I am back in the city, and I do not have a contract limiting my availability.” Kincaid put his hands on the floor and clutched piles of straw. “It’s been, what, four years?” “Close enough, yes. But I am still very eligible.” “Over my dead body.” Sholeh’s heart skipped a beat even as she knew what he meant. The threat to her was real, and it affected him personally. But she couldn’t have a war of wizards and the church. Even if it was only one wizard. They’d lose. “It is dangerous for us to stay in the city, Kincaid. When Sigurd and Adelaise rescued me in the stonecutter’s yard, we should have left.” “We’re not staying. We have something to do.” “But at what cost? To all of us?” “Have you seen your mother or your father since you have been back?” The question wasn’t sent with an accusation, but it hit her square in the heart. “No, I have not seen anyone in my family.” “They know you are here?” “Yes.” “So, what now?” “We make our stand against your wizard, and we leave the place behind. The Empire is no longer safe for any of us.” “I wish you told me earlier.” “Tell you the tragic story about my escape from the capital and the choices my parents forced upon me? Why would I want to do that with the young man who always had plans to take on the world and become a great hero? The man who would be the youngest to become a master of the carpentry guild in a generation? That young man inspired me to great things, and the shadows of the past were always behind me with the bright sun leading me forward.” “I wished I asked, then.” “I would not have answered those questions, even had you knew enough to ask about them. This city was behind me.” “Then why didn’t you say anything when I said we should come here after Caesea?” Sholeh had to think about that answer. Why did she take the risk to come back to Pilaetium? For Kincaid, for sure. He needed to know more about the magic he could control. For herself, maybe so. Unfinished business around the Empire. There was a kernel of curiosity in her heart about her family and the state of affairs. Those questions were answered. “I did it for you, Kincaid. This was the answer to the moments that changed your life. The schools of magic offered you what you needed, and you honored Cormac’s dying wishes. How could I say no?” “Because you risked everything to come back here.” “Not everything. Some things are worth fighting for, my friend. And we picked up two new vagabonds to join our group of misfits.” “The Empire may regret this group of misfits bonding within the confines of Pilaetium.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Showdown",
      "content": "Kincaid - Showdown Stonecutters cleaned up rock fragments and secured their tools. Masons washed away the excess mortar and stacked the remaining stones for another day’s labor. None of the men and women paid attention as Kincaid walked the length of the unfinished wall. Their day was done. The warmth and company of the Outer City beckoned these laborers. The labor was exhausting, but each stone laid in this wall was a visible cue for the work they’d finished. People in power couldn’t see the results of their decisions, and their work may take years or even a generation to see the outcome. Workers saw the results every day. The work of their hands was there for all to see. Being a magi was a blend of the two. When he used his magic, the results were in front of his eyes. The impact was all around them with the most subtle magic or the most powerful blasts. But the games of magic were like the struggles of the powerful. The cues were faint, and the results often undetermined for years. If a wizard could live long enough to see them. Kincaid couldn’t afford an uncertain outcome today. If Bartalan guessed his secret, the world would change. The magi had no doubt the streets would fill with bodies as Bartalan surged to the highest reaches of power. He wouldn’t control himself. Who was he to talk? Kincaid felt the frail souls of the sick and dying swirling at the edge of his own soul. He’d killed more than he could count for an advantage in this battle. His hands weren’t clean, and his conscience was dark with his decisions. His soul bore the price of his choices one way or another. Sholeh talked with a few of the stonecutters. She didn’t stray far from his side, and Kincaid admired her connection with these workers. He was once like that, one with a workforce. But she was an angel to them. A messenger of hope that they could make it through another day with hard work and chip away at the bonds of their own life. They could dream of a new place. He remembered when she was that way for him. Kincaid didn’t search the rooftops for Sigurd. He assumed the man would climb to find the best perch. Against a wizard, being on a roof was a dangerous location. But Sigurd was convinced that people don’t tend to look up, only focusing on what is in front of their face. Kincaid couldn’t talk him out of it, so he didn’t try. Adelaise worked the side streets, stalking in the shadows with her weapons, ready for work. She would be a wild card in the upcoming fight. If she could get close, she’d be deadly. But Kincaid wasn’t confident the captain would get a chance with her blades. Kincaid had to make sure the fight centered on himself, and he finished this confrontation the right way. They wouldn’t have a force chasing them across the world looking for his secrets. A surge of magic raised the hairs on Kincaid’s forearms. Another followed. And then more. Take your place as their leader. Establish your position as their master and claim the school for your own. The voice wasn’t a booming echo anymore. It was subtle, insistent, and clear. The command threw Kincaid’s stride off as he considered the words. He wasn’t in the Outer City anymore. People cutting stone were a distant memory, and the nobility of the Empire gathered in a magnificent hall. Not just any hall, the audience chamber of the Grand Palace of Pilaetium. Wealth gleamed from every corner of the room, and the voices were hushed. Kincaid rose from the cushioned throne. The gems glittered in the light, gold shone with its polish, and purple silks brushed against his skin. Nobles, merchants, hecaerae, and masters bent a knee and bowed their heads. None resisted him. A surge of power flooded his lungs and allowed his voice to carry across the room. “Bring the diplomats forward.” The command was Kincaid’s voice, and he was in the room. But he wasn’t. His mind fought against the strange differences what his eyes could see but his logic challenged. The golden doors swung into the room. A platoon of guards in breastplates and flowing cloaks escorted the person into the room. Attius Atros walked in. Not as the arrogant Duke of Caesea. Instead, he was a bowed supplicant ready to surrender his city to the power and might of a king. No, a new emperor. An emperor of emperors. This is yours. This is why you came to the Empire of a Thousand Spears. Kincaid struggled against the voice seeping into his soul. A part of his mind registered the raging tide of magic threatening his being, but he relished the moment and cherished the thought of power. He looked to the golden chair to his right, and the cushioned expanse was empty. His heartbeat stopped for a moment, knowing he was missing an essential part of his life. Someone should be there. If he could remember. He glanced at his advisers, looking for faces he could recognize. Smiling sycophants stood around him and nodded their faked appreciation for his generosity. Guards faced the gathered crowd and ignored the Emperor standing at his lonely throne. The group stayed on their knees, waiting for a command. A command Kincaid couldn’t give. His mind wrestled control back from the image, and the voice whispered words he could no longer understand. His forearm hurt. Sholeh looked him in the eyes. Lines on her face etched with worry. This wasn’t their plan. She talked to him, and he forced his mind to listen. “He wants your answer.” Kincaid blinked away the vision and fought to control the magic within. He noticed the power around him, surging in the gathering of hecaerae from Damis and even two from Theurgia. Bartalan. His half smile covered his face, and his arrogance was backed up by the power of his magic and the four hecaerae standing behind him. “So, this is the blacksmith the church is looking for. You should think twice about your next options, Kincaid.” This wasn’t their plan. Their simple setup to reach an agreement and fight only if necessary was gone. His agenda to wage the fight alone, if necessary, was now a dream. One that would turn into a nightmare. “What options do you see, Bartalan?” “Are you deaf?” “No, too busy imagining you kneeling before me, begging for forgiveness.” “That’s how you see this happening, chronomancer?” “If I did, you should be scared.” The man standing in front of him lost his youth to the corruption of magic. Gray sprinkled through his hair, and lines radiated from the corners of his eyes. Wrinkles graced the back of his hands. The years were not kind. “You have much to tell us, magi. We should go to a bar and discuss over a good beverage.” The sickly smile dripped with a faked appreciation of his position. “I’m done discussing with you, Bartalan. Don’t make me show you what happens in your future.” The gathered hecaerae looked toward one another. Kincaid didn’t know what their leader offered them, but the Theurgians didn’t look like they wanted part of a magical storm building before their eyes. Magic was everywhere around them, but their focus was on the pair in the middle. “You connect with magic stronger than ever, magi. How did you do it?” “Bartalan, you had to maintain your power to keep me separated from the arcane plane, didn’t you?” The gathering of hecaerae looked more uncertain. Even the Theurgians must know about Bartalan’s unique ability with magic. Sholeh stepped to the side and had a hammer in each hand now. “I did. I wanted you to feel despair and know the depths of your darkness.” “Looks like you found your own. I imagine you break a mirror every time you gaze into its depths now.” “How?” “I had to understand what you were doing, probe with my senses. If I had never touched magic before, you would have been successful. But I am a magi, and your power wasn’t complete.” “That’s not all, is there?” Kincaid felt the souls stir in his consciousness. No, that would never be all with this man. He’d want more. And there were many others like him. Kincaid twisted the flow of magic and looked at the ghosts of the future. The magi stepped in close, only inches away from his nose. “There are secrets of magic no one should know. I’ll carry that curse alone.” Magic flared with a red light. Bartalan lashed out with the power raging in his soul, but Kincaid was already in motion. The ghostly images showed Bartalan’s rage turning to explosive lances of fire from his fingertips. The heat singed his clothes, and the stolen souls wailed at the power surging through his veins. But he wasn’t in the place where the shots were aimed. The surge of magic allowed the magi to move somehow faster. Or at least with enough warning to get away from the targeted area. Kincaid pushed the circle of power around him, watching the path of the future shape the events around Sholeh. She’d be safe for a few more moments. The other wizards would recover from their shock soon enough. “Did you see that?” one of the accompanying hecaerae asked. His voice was shrill with the magic exploding around them. “He doesn’t age like the rest of us,” although the voice was low, Kincaid could hear the tone clearly with his augmented senses. The Theurgian hecaerae was being pulled into Bartalan’s circle of influence. The fight was going to be brutal. Bartalan clenched his jaw and ground his teeth. The flow of magic raged inside the man, and Kincaid’s senses felt all of it. With the power in this part of the city, every wizard would know of mages' duel. And this was one reason Kincaid chose this spot. None would have the time to intervene, even if they could figure out what was going on. The angry hecaerae pulled in more magic and slammed an area around Kincaid. This wasn’t flame, gravity, or illusion. Instead, Bartalan tried to sever Kincaid’s touch with the arcane plane. Their wills battled. Magic fought magic, and the pair stood motionless. Kincaid felt his grip on magic falter, and his will longed for a deeper pull of magic to counteract the rushing waterfall of energy surging against him. He chose to stop fighting. Magic slashed through his remaining control, and Bartalan took the first step toward him. His face glowed with power even as it aged. His eyes were alight with victory, and his posture was the arrogance of conquest. Kincaid stood quietly. The first snap of a bow broke the stillness of the air. Eyes hunted for the deadly dark shape, but none knew the location of the shot. Until it hit the first Theurgian in the throat. The arrow tore through the neck of the hecaerae and splattered the nearby Theurgian with gore. Hands flailed at the injury for a moment before life slipped away from the body. Blood trickled toward the grooves in the cobblestone. Magic raged everywhere as shields surged for defense. But for one of the other hecaerae, the shield was a moment too late. Adelaise’s family blade was a dark flash in the sunlight. The imperfect arcane shield surrendered to the surgical blow from an unexpected direction. The tip of the sword went for the heart. With a flick, the blade was back out as another body hit the ground. “Not just magic here, Bartalan.” “No, but mine is, and you’ll tell me your secrets.” Sholeh was also in motion now. She pulled back her arm and launched her hammer from her right hand, and Bartalan couldn’t ignore the heavy projectile aimed for his chest. With a wave of his hand, an arcane surge flashed and slammed the hammer to the ground. Kincaid longed to touch the arcane plane, but he needed Bartalan to stay focused on him. He wielded enough power to kill each of his companions without a stray thought. His opponent was dangerous enough to do whatever his mind willed, and that was Kincaid’s role in the plan. Another arrow crossed the distance from the rooftop, but this arrow exploded against a shield of magic. Blue sparks danced and splattered across stones. This shot was enough for the last Damithian to note the location. Adelaise was still in motion as she closed the gap with the last Theurgian. Her blades were clutched in each hand and held low for an attack. The female wizard didn’t show signs of concern for the deadly mercenary’s approach. In a flash of magic, light bent around the hecaerae. She disappeared from view. The plan just got harder if they lost track of the wizards in the fight. Bartalan was the most important, but any of them could be deadly. Kincaid lost his sense of confidence, and the arcane plane beckoned his strength, just beyond the boundary Bartalan maintained between them. Kincaid glanced at the location of his companions. Bartalan laughed. “No plan will work against this collection of hecaerae.” “Students. Just students.” “Practitioners, magi. Each one of us has special skills, and any can kill you all.” “But you aren’t here to kill me. You want something.” “I do. But your friends don’t figure into our calculus. We only need you to survive.” The man kept walking forward to confront Kincaid. Even separated from his magic, Kincaid sensed the power grappling with the man’s soul. The flow was a torrent of energy, and time was not treating the man well. He would risk everything to know what Kincaid knew. Sholeh came from behind a low wall with her hammer swinging hard at Bartalan’s head. The power of years of smithing was behind the sure blow, but the hammer exploded into fragments as it struck an arcane shield around him. The young smith’s body flung back nearly four yards and collapsed in the empty street. She struggled to get back to her feet. “You care about this one. Very good.” With a wave of his hand, Bartalan summoned another flow of magic. “You’ll remember this.” Sholeh’s body flattened to the ground, and she groaned under the pressure of the invisible attack. Kincaid didn’t hold back. He severed the separating boundary to the arcane plane with a stolen soul, and magic came back to him in a rush. Bartalan’s eyes flung wide even as his pupils glowed with a deep blue. “You do not have the power to separate me from the arcane plane, hecaerae. No one can. Release her.” Kincaid twisted another soul to look into the future at the images of what could be. Lances of arcane magic were aimed at Adelaise, lightning flashed from the heavens toward Sigurd, and Bartalan’s power crushed Sholeh. And Bartalan gloated over his victory. In a rage of power, Kincaid twisted his stolen souls in the other direction. The images stopped. Everything stopped. The souls were starting to pop out of existence into oblivion like corn kernels near a fire. Kincaid used magic to pull Adelaise out of the way of the blast, push Sigurd to the side, and hide Sholeh from the energy crushing her. He will destroy everything you love. There is only one way out of this. The voice was insistent and impossible to ignore. Images of the city aflame stoked the imagination in his mind. The emperor waited for him on bended knee. The world waited for his arrival. No. Kincaid released his control on time and let the events flow. Arcane blasts ripped through the air and missed a surprised Adelaise. Lightning crackled and singed a confused Sigurd. And Sholeh’s body was moved out of the area of gravity crushing her. Kincaid knew he didn’t have much magic left in this fight before it took its terrible toll on his soul. But he couldn’t think of a better cause than to take care of his friends. He brought them into this. With a flash of arcane energy, Kincaid snapped across the distance to Sigurd’s target. The magi's arrival stunned the student for a moment as he turned to face a new threat. Kincaid opened the ground at the man’s feet. The man jumped into the air and formed a cushion of air. He bared his teeth in an otherworldly grin at Kincaid’s effort. But he missed the intent of the movement. Sigurd took the shot, and the arrow slammed into the man. Floating on an air pocket, the man took the impact of the projectile against his shield. Even though the missile couldn’t punch through the defense, the impact was enough to send the floating man spinning several yards away. More arrows followed the path. Spinning out of control, the man gave up his cushion of air and collapsed to the ground. Except the field became another hole that buried the man alive. With a crushing push, Kincaid snapped the life out of the man before he could react. Adelaise was in a fight for her life. She was fast, and her blades hunted for a target. But the invisible opponent didn’t give her an opening for an attack. At least any movement was sufficient for Adelaise’s trained reaction to respond to sounds. Even the shuffling of feet was enough to drive the female wizard back. Kincaid launched a small fireball from his hands. The blast rippled against the power around the invisible hecaerae’s shield, revealing the unseen location. Adelaise launched a flurry of attacks against the woman. The family blade was a dark streak in Kincaid’s eyes. The blade tore through the magical shields and brought a stream of blood and a surprised yelp from the attack. The darkness surged in Adelaise’s hands. In a moment, the last student was down. Kincaid turned back to Bartalan to see the man clutching Sholeh’s throat.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Final Actions",
      "content": "Kincaid - Final Actions “You could have shared your secret with me, Kincaid. All of this death could have been avoided.” “No more death, Bartalan. Let her go.” “Everyone saw what you can do. Everyone.” “There are no witnesses left, Bartalan. Just you and me. We can settle this.” “That’s what he wants.” “Who?” “The one who is telling us what to do. You know what it is, don’t you?” Kincaid steps shuffled to a stop in the street. His hands fell by his side as he looked at the desperation on Bartalan’s face. Sholeh hung limply in his arm. Strength surged in Bartalan’s hand to keep her body off the ground, and a thought would snap her neck. “A voice. An image of the future.” “No. It wants one of us to win.” “Then you should give up now.” “I won’t. You have everything that I want.” The voice edged into the hysterical. Magic raged in Bartalan’s soul as his mind fought for control of the magic he wielded. “Then the woman has nothing to do with that.” “If she gives me leverage, then she has everything to do with what I want. What it wants.” Kincaid hunted inside his mind for the voice to talk to him again. That insistent rumble was gone. Watching. Waiting. Calculating. At least Kincaid was alone. Kincaid glanced into the future between them, and the ghostly images stayed linked to their bodies. The standoff would continue. “Your friends can’t harm me.” Kincaid glanced toward Adelaise circling behind Bartalan, and he noted Sigurd coming down from his rooftop perch. His bared steel pointed like a lance toward the hecaerae. Kincaid nodded. “I know that.” “You have so much more to lose than I do. And I stand to gain everything. Listen to your mind. The voice. We can work together and take on the world.” Kincaid noticed the fingers twitch and the wildly gesturing free hand. “Is that what your voice says to you? Cooperate and work together? Join forces?” Doubt flashed across Bartalan’s face, and the hand locked on Sholeh’s throat. With augmented strength, he lifted her body until her boots left the ground. “This offer isn’t going to last, Kincaid.” “Nor is mine, Bartalan. You need to put her down, and we’ll have a talk. Just you and me.” Kincaid started to walk forward. He kept his magic in close check, and the number of souls left as his command was a paltry few. Maybe two more surges of magic or one strong push, and they’d be done. He’d burn through his life in a few moments against the power Bartalan could wield. “Take another step, and I’ll kill her. Then the others.” “Like the number of steps we take matters for men like you and me.” Kincaid shook his head. “You’re losing it, hecaerae. Put her down.” Bartalan lifted her higher, and Kincaid heard Sholeh choking from the pressure. Her breath rattled as her body fought for each ounce of air into her lungs. He was done negotiating with this hecaerae. With a small surge of magic, Kincaid crafted a pocket of time between himself and Bartalan. He closed the distance to minimize the amount of magic he’d need to adjust the time flow. Magic surged and raged in his heart as the next soul died. With a flick of magic, a whip of arcane energy lashed out from Kincaid’s fingertips. Bartalan couldn’t move fast enough to avoid the blow. The whip flashed across Bartalan’s forearm. Pain registered in his eyes in slow motion. He tried to pull his head to look at his arm as blood splashed from severed veins. Sholeh fell to the ground, her body outside of the time pocket. Bartalan’s hand fell away from his body. In the next moment of stolen time, Kincaid lashed air like steel bands around his opponent and closed the last two steps. The time pocket collapsed between them. “How?” Blood pooled at his feet, and Bartalan still wanted to know about magic. “Let me show you.” Kincaid grabbed Bartalan by the head. Both hands clutched the sides of the man’s face, and the roaring magic inside Bartlan’s soul leaped to the touch. Kincaid pulled in a deep breath and grabbed the soul. Recognition flashed in Bartalan’s eyes for a moment. Then the body was a soulless corpse in Kincaid’s hand. The raging magic was gone, and the powerful soul swirled next to Kincaid’s own. The edge of the city was quiet.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Aftermath",
      "content": "Kincaid - Aftermath “What just happened?” Adelaise asked. “Magic.” Kincaid turned away from the approaching mercenary and dropped to his knees next to Sholeh’s body. He clutched her hand and gave it a squeeze as he watched her chest rise and fall with each life-giving breath. She’d suffered so much since he discovered his power with magic. Noble families and now wizards went after her to get to him. With his new group of companions, they’d be next for anyone who wanted to influence him. Worse, they’d torture them to find out his secrets. But he couldn’t go on without them. They were his foundation to maintain control of his soul. The constant battle with his conscience was always in question as he considered what he had to do to keep him safe. The curse of his magic forced him to make terrible choices. Why did Sholeh even stay? Kincaid couldn’t hide from these thoughts as he watched her body fight to stay alive. Her eyes twitched under closed lids, and her body drug itself back to consciousness. Pain flashed across her face as her awareness registered the pain. It broke Kincaid’s heart that he was responsible for her suffering. Again. “I couldn’t see everything you did, Kincaid.” Adelaise’s voice distracted him from Sholeh’s plight. “Probably better that way.” Kincaid looked up from his fallen friend at the wide eyes and surprised face of the mercenary. Sigurd stayed a respectful distance away from the group, unwilling to come closer. “No, I had a clear line of sight to you and the rest of the fight, and I couldn’t see everything you did. You were beyond sight, making things happen. Then you were here.” Awe shaped the tone of her voice. “I did what I had to do. Our plan could have gone bad quickly when Bartalan brought these other students into the fight.” “I’m not so sure they fought as students. Full hecaerae.” “The line is blurred between student and master. The curse of magic is terrible. The young ones want the power the arcane plane can give them. The old ones have the wisdom to never use it.” Sigurd spat to the side and muttered, “Magic.” “Today, I agree with you, Sigurd. My life used to be simple, and then I was imprisoned for power I didn’t know I had and didn’t know how to use.” “Use it, you did.” Adelaise pointed out the bodies of the students in the open area. “And you saved our lives in that fight. More than a student.” Kincaid watched the pools of blood collecting under the corpses. None drew a breath or dreamed of a potential future. Their last decision was to join Bartalan and engage in this fight against Kincaid and his group. “Magi.” “What does that mean?” “Some days, I feel like it’s a title of wisdom and a grand gesture of power. Others, I wonder if it is a curse word to indicate the damned. I’d trade it all to have my old life back.” Adelaise squatted next to Sholeh. Her fingers probed Sholeh’s neck and traced lines across the body. “She’ll be ok. Her heart is beating fine, and I don’t think she has any bad breaks. Sigurd, let’s pick her up and move from here. The lightning and power may have kept the people and guards away, but that’ll change soon. We should get a head start against some of the questions that will come our way.” Sigurd took a circular route to keep a distance away from Kincaid as he approached. His eyes never left the young magi as he crouched next to his friend. Kincaid didn’t blame him for his caution and fear. The northerner scooped her head up under one giant arm, and then he swept the other arm under her legs. He hefted her up like a baby in his arms, and Sholeh let out a groan from the change of position. Kincaid winced with the moan, but Adelaise was right. They needed to move away from here. “Where to?” Adelaise looked around the area. “I’m going to head down the street and scout out a place for us to get a room. Walking in with a body is going to attract more attention than we want. Kincaid, stay with Sigurd.” Sigurd shot Adelaise a look of disgust. The mercenary ignored him as she set off at a quick pace down the Outer City's side street. “Let’s follow, but more slowly.” “They will find us, yes.” “Depends on who you mean by ‘they.’” “More students.” He avoided the word wizard. “I don’t think so. Bartalan led a small group of wizards that hungered for power. I think he brought all that he could to this fight.” “Hope, yes.” “Hope for sure.” He wished he had more confidence in what he was saying for their group. Another attack would be more than they could bear. Kincaid analyzed the powerful soul mixed with his own. He doubted they would attack again, and he knew they couldn’t win against his power. But he’d be back to where he was—a simple man with a soul threatened by every moment of magic. “Where do we go next?” At least the northerner was using the term “we.” “I’m in the anywhere but here camp, Sigurd. Too many enemies and too much unfinished business. In this town, that’s a challenge for every other source of power.” Despite the load, Sigurd’s footsteps were light and quick. He walked as if he wasn’t carrying the most important person in Kincaid’s life. His eyes didn’t stop looking to the rooftops and the shadows of each alley. Kincaid flinched at each sound echoing down the street. Adelaise and her red cloak flickered up ahead. She worked in and out of several buildings but kept moving down the street. Kincaid wasn’t sure they had enough distance away from the fight before the watch showed to investigate the bodies, but he wondered if it mattered. With enough bodies, they’d seal the city and keep up the search. In a few moments, Adelaise was moving toward them. Her blades swung at her hips as she trotted down the street. “There’s a house with a room for rent. It has a back set of stairs. It’ll work for now.” Kincaid nodded his thanks. Adelaise guided them to the structure and led the way up the stairs. She pulled open the door and slipped inside. The room stunk of old sweat and sticky beer. He didn’t want to know what the fluid was in the jug in one corner of the room. A mouse scurried away from the pile of old straw in one corner. “Your taste is in question,” Sigurd said. Even the hardened northerner wasn’t impressed with the choice. “Well, I didn’t think we would make the grand parade up the Emperor’s street to grab a room in a palace.” “I don’t think anyone looking for us would start there.” Kincaid’s humor fell flat. “With as many bodies as we leave behind in this city, I imagine we’d be standing at the foot of the throne explaining why we shot, cut, and killed so many guards.” Kincaid let the discussion go. He picked through the best of the straw on the ground and created a small pile. Sigurd lay Sholeh down and adjusted her body to allow her to relax. “I will go and get some food and drink, yes.” “Smarter than the rest of us.” Sigurd smiled and headed out the door.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Last Plan",
      "content": "Kincaid - Last Plan “We can’t stay in the city,” Kincaid said. “We’re leaving a trail of bodies in organizations with a great deal of power.” Adelaise was scrubbing the blood off her arms with sawdust. Fetching water was too dangerous now. “How many organizations are we talking about?” “A few extra for Sigurd and me.” “Nice. Place odds on if we’ll make it to tonight?” Kincaid snorted and turned back to Sholeh’s unconscious body. “Even our unconscious friend has her own troubles.” Adelaise padded up and placed a hand on his shoulder. “I made a mistake coming to Pilaetium. I thought people here could help me, but I made everything worse.” “You did find people who can help you. They just weren’t the ones you were planning.” She gave him a smile and a squeeze on the arm. For a moment, that touch shifted the heavy burden on his soul. “You don’t have to stay.” “And miss out on all the fun this group has?” Her smile revealed her white teeth, and laughter danced across her eyes. “A mercenary on probation isn’t a marketable source of income. Might as well hang out with the wizards and see what wealth can come our way. Right?” “It seems like we live on the edge of starvation rather than adventure. Not sure if this is a wealth-building profession. So far, I find myself at the mercy of a few well-meaning people.” “Then we’ll need to change that in our future. Find a place where we can start a new life and use some skills that can make us some money.” Kincaid looked toward his friend. “Money hasn’t been the goal. Just a means. Once, I used to dream of running my own shop in Caesea. I knew how much each square foot of space cost. I built a plan to pay my workers, earn a commission, and create art. All of that is gone. And I wonder if any of that was ever worth it.” “Do not confuse the mess we are in now with the dreams you once had—” “I don’t. But my experience burned through the fog of the man I once was. I see there’s so much more to the world. The darker parts have always been there.” “Which is why you need a talented group of friends to back you up. It’s just one reason why people come to my guild. For the right price, someone is there to back them up.” “I don’t have anything to pay.” “I’m not a mercenary now. Just a friend.” Kincaid blinked back the water flooding his vision. He didn’t look up as Sholeh stirred from her prone position. “What is that smell?” Her voice squeaked with the words, and Kincaid rushed to sit next to her. He held her hand in his lap. “First place that we found to get you off the streets.” “By all that is holy, you should have looked harder to find somewhere else.” She licked her lips, and her eyes slipped open. She reached up to stroke Kincaid’s scruffy face. “Do not worry. I am made of tougher metal than you think.” “Against magic, metal doesn’t seem to work too well.” The door came open as Sigurd came back. “Smells worse than I remember. And metal does work against magic. Ask the students, yes?” Sholeh pulled herself up into a sitting position, bracing her body in the corner of the room. Sigurd handed her a full skin of liquid. She looked questioningly at the bag. “Water. Ale is too much for you right now.” He gave a smile. “The brew is for us.” He handed out two loaves of bread and put a small pot on the floor. When he pulled the top off, the aroma of a thick gravy stew flooded the chamber. “I’m impressed. Where did you get this?” Adelaise asked. “I am Sigurd, thief. Perhaps you have heard of me?” “We weren’t supposed to attract more attention to our group, Sigurd.” Adelaise didn’t move toward the food. “I didn’t bring attention. They will not even know it was gone. Besides, I paid for most of it. Just hungry after a good fight.” Adelaise shook her head. Sholeh tried a small sip of water and winced as her throat contracted from the effort. Sigurd, on the other hand, took a long pull from a jug. “Where do you think we should go from here?” Kincaid asked the question on his heart. As he looked at his three companions, he appreciated their patience with his crazy ideas. But, this wasn’t time for fancy rhetoric. All eyes in the room turned toward him. Their faces were honest and open, and each looked at him with respect. Sholeh’s even held understanding. Kincaid didn’t sense any were keeping a secret agenda. “Time to see more of the world, yes? Spread the legend of Sigurd to new lands, make different merchants fear for their wealth.” Sigurd’s smile was contagious, even as he buried it with another drink. Adelaise shook her head at the large man’s antics. “There’s no option for us to make a living here. Every major power within the city now has a grudge, and more will become interested when those student corpses are discovered. Time to find our way someplace else.” Sholeh took another sip of the water. Her neck was already starting to bruise. “I do not see a reason to stay here. But if there is something else you need to learn, my friend, then we will make it happen.” Kincaid’s heart swelled with the emotion in the room. Each one had come here for their own purposes, and each chose to fight for each other. A fight they could have easily lost. Now they were offering to leave behind the very reason they came to Pilaetium. For him. He wrestled with the thoughts. “I wish I could find words better than thank you. Nobody has to leave here with me.” He held up his hand before any of them could argue their point. They’d already been clear with him. “But there’s nothing left for me to learn here, Sholeh. The hecaerae don’t have secrets they will share, and I understand their flavor of power. Magi Cormac was right at the same time he was wrong. What do we do?” That was the harder question, and the group considered what their future might look like. Kincaid was confident it would be together. “We should start by moving away from the stench of this room,” Adelaise said. “Yes, and we should remember who found this one. Taste is not the captain’s strength.” Adelaise glared at the grinning man. “Besides, we want to keep the investigators off our trail. Move further into the city to plan our next move.” “To the Northern States?” Sholeh’s voice was low but clear. Anywhere but here would be a good start. Kincaid stroked his chin. “Magi Cormac told me he started learning magic in the Northern States. All when he was much younger.” “But this mentor of yours sent you to the Empire to find out more. Seems like a bit of a contradiction,” Adelaise said. “I agree. But magic has been a contradiction from the moment I used it. Imprisonment for using this power was just the first contradiction.” “At least the Northern States will be colder, and the air is pure. A land of good fights, yes?” “I thought you were a thief?” Adelaise joked. “When necessary. But always a northman.” “It’s a start, but it’ll take some work to uncover the centers of magic in the Northern States. But I feel like I just keep missing something. I hope we can find it in the north.” “How do you feel, Sholeh. Do you think you can move? We don’t want Sigurd carrying you again.” Adelaise had genuine concern in her voice. “I think I can walk.” The smith got to her feet and put one hand against the wall behind her for balance. She held her head up and smiled. “Yes, this feels better to stand up.” “Then we should leave in twos with a small gap between our departure. A group like ours will attract attention.” “Where to?” Kincaid asked. “Back to the docks, yes? There’s a bar there that I know. Only a few rooms to let to private customers. The Three Sails Bar, two streets off the water. A quiet place to drink. I will get the room.” Kincaid didn’t have better options at this point, and the docks would be an excellent place to consider their next destination. “We’ll see you there.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Farewell",
      "content": "Sholeh - Farewell The docks were always an exciting district. When she was a blacksmith in this city, the ship captains and merchants from this area were faithful customers. They needed quality work and paid with solid coin for the effort. Many would tell the tales of adventure on the seas and the exotic lands away from the Empire. Those stories were often too hard to believe because the Empire was a remarkable place of collected wealth and power. Armies sallied forth in the spring and returned with prizes and prisoners in chains from around the world. Now the docks were a refuge—a location to blend in away from the forces looking for them. The concealment wouldn’t last long. The simple bars held simple people. Sholeh didn’t doubt for a second that any of these men or women would sell them out for a few coins. Life was survival out here. Sides didn’t matter. Except for the three people gathered in the room. Each of them picked a side, and none of those choices included organizations from the Inner City. In fact, they created their own center of power by magic, by blade, and by friendship. There was a guiding light for their efforts. Too much had happened for them to consider it was all coincidental. Kincaid worried her the most. His soul carried the world. She remembered the young man with a fire in his heart to take on the world. He was poised to be a young master of his own shop and had the discipline to make those dreams a reality. She’d fallen for that man, and he always made her stronger. That young man wasn’t standing in front of her anymore. His eyes were wrinkled, and his face carried the weight of his responsibility. The old Kincaid was under the façade, but that former self didn’t often emerge in their time in Pilaetium. He looked like a soldier who’d seen too many campaigns. Kincaid caught her lingering gaze and gave her a smile. That simple grin melted her heart. The old Kincaid was there, right how she remembered him. If she could get him help with his magic, they might be able to start again. A rap at the door startled Sholeh from her introspection. “Sigurd, you should come downstairs.” The voice was low but insistent from the other side of the paneling. Sigurd lunged for his blade and gripped the pommel in one hand, and the other grabbed the sheath. Adelaise was in a low crouch, balance forward. Her weapons were always within reach. He looked back toward Adelaise and Sholeh and shrugged his shoulders when no one came through the door. Sholeh tried not to gasp when she glanced at Kincaid. The young man’s eyes glowed with blue shards of ice in front of the usual green irises. She imagined he was humming with the power of magic. His snarl curled the corner of his right lip, and his body was ready for a fight. Sigurd wrapped his weapon belt around his waist and cinched it tight. With his height, drawing a blade over his shoulder inside this inn would be impossible. He’d be left with his dirk. Before the northerner left, he held a finger to his lips for silence. As the door clicked shut, Sholeh went to Kincaid’s side and placed a hand on Kincaid’s forearm. His eyes gazed off into a place beyond the door of the room. Maybe beyond the confines of the city. A bead of sweat formed on his brow from an effort she couldn’t understand. “I’m right here, my friend.” She gave him a squeeze to pull him back from the edge of the abyss. Kincaid blinked a few times and looked her way. His smile was back. Big, genuine, and with teeth. “You can tell now?” “By all that is holy, you do not make it very hard to tell you are pulsing with the power of your magic.” Adelaise shot them a look, and Sholeh lowered her voice. Kincaid caught the glance as well and pulled close to Sholeh. She liked the feel of his warmth, and his breath tickled her neck. “I didn’t know what was on the other side of that door. Not magic, but it could still be dangerous.” “We understand, Kincaid. We are in this together.” He nodded to affirm her assurance and slipped his arm around her shoulders. After a squeeze, he dropped the embrace and focused back on the door. Footsteps climbed the stairs, and the wood creaked in protest from the weight approaching the door. Three quick knocks followed by two long knocks. They held their breath with the pause, and then the door lock clicked. Sigurd ducked to enter the room. “Here for Sholeh.” Sholeh glanced at her friends. None had an accusing glance. “By the good and the holy, who?” “Looks like several people from the church. Big words, wealth, and emblems. And asking specifically for you.” “Why would they want you to come downstairs?” Sigurd chuckled. “Finding the big northerner, the redhead, and the woman in red was easier than the city native. And they know you are with this group.” “It was a matter of time before they found us, Sholeh. It’s ok, we’re with you,” Adelaise said. “Did they want me to come alone?” “They did not say this. I think Adelaise is right. Perhaps they should see the entire group.” “How many did they bring?” “Three. Two men at arms and a priest.” “Not enough to capture me.” Sholeh chewed on the inside of her lip. After the time in the stonecutter’s yard, she expected a swarm of knights and priests to fall on their position. They’d take what they wanted. Like they always did. “We won’t let that happen, Sholeh.” Kincaid’s hand slipped into hers and gave her a squeeze. If they didn’t bring a wizard, they’d never have a chance to take her. The confidence flowing into her veins was enough to decide. “I think I will go downstairs and see what they want. Would any of you like to join me for a walk?” Smiles and nods around the room. Her companions adjusted themselves and let her lead the way. The corridor was simple wood with no decorations. Doors were shut and probably latched. Life on the docks was never easy, and this inn wasn’t known for its prosperity. Sigurd picked this inn because it had numerous exits to different alleys near the docks. The common room greeted them with smells of cooking meat and the crackle of a fire. Smoke traced patterns along the ceiling's timbers as the staff worked to prepare an evening meal over the fire in the room. With most patrons, sailors, and dockworkers already at work, the space was empty except for the staff, a few drinkers, and the church's people. Sholeh recognized the priest but fought down her emotions. Of all the people he could have sent, he sent this one. “Sholeh, it has been quite some time. You look lovely.” “I will not go willingly.” “I did not bring an army.” The priest in his elaborate and expensive robes looked over her friends. “But it seems you did. Perhaps you expected a fight?” “After the stonecutter’s, I expected a fight. But I also expected to win.” “Yes, yes. I can see that with your gathering. But if you were so certain on avoiding the church and all her glory, I can’t imagine why you would want to stay within the confines of Pilaetium. I would imagine you were asking for trouble.” “On some days, we found it. We are not staying, Cyrus.” “I’m glad you remembered, my betrothed. I hoped we didn’t need to go through formal introductions at this juncture.” Heat flushed Sholeh’s face, and she didn’t dare to look at her friends. “But I’m only somewhat familiar with your companions. I gather the northerner is Sigurd. I heard the people at the bar mention that one.” “Yes, thief of Pilaetium. Warrior of the north. Perhaps you have heard of me?” The priest ignored him. Sigurd didn’t seem to mind, and he circled out to the left to keep both guards in sight. “And you. The wealth in your weapons alone is fit for nobility. I would imagine that even the emperor would be jealous of those blades.” “He would be hard-pressed to send enough soldiers after me to take them.” Adelaise shrugged her shoulders and leaned against the wall off to Sholeh’s right. “You don’t need all of this help, Sholeh. I’m not here for a fight. You can see I only brought enough guards to make my way to the Outer City and the filth of the docks.” “I would imagine a priest would find a home here among the unbelievers. Spread the faith for those most in need.” Sholeh couldn’t keep the edge out of her voice. She didn’t like where Cyrus was going with this conversation. Typical of events in the city, though. Always posturing for position and power. Sholeh had been his prize. “Yes, yes, of course. I will certainly stop by the chapel on my way back to the cathedral. But the patriarch won’t be happy unless I bring you with me.” “The patriarch will not see me. Perhaps the bodies were not the right message for him?” “I’m afraid he will insist, Sholeh.” “You did not hear the young lady. It is time for you to leave.” “I’m afraid not, Sigurd.” He turned back to Sholeh and locked his gaze on her eyes. “You should have left if you truly did not want to see him.” Sholeh glanced around the room. The servants were making their way out of the common area, and crackling fire hungrily consumed the fat dripping from the meat on the spit. “You aren’t alone,” Kincaid whispered. She imagined knights and soldiers guarding every door, sealing her friends inside. Torches would hungrily consume the walls, filling the inn with smoke. Crossbows would cut down any that tried to escape. They were trapped. “I was sent in here because you would trust me more than any other.” “I’ve known you for a long time.” Sholeh couldn’t stop glancing toward the main door of the inn. She hoped her friends watched the other exits. The threat of being killed within this inn made her heart race. “Why don’t you come outside and talk with us?” “So you can cut my friends and me down with arrows? I do not think so.” “He thought you would say that.” Cyrus looked down at the ground and then back up to her eyes. “He came from the Inner City to see you.” Sholeh couldn’t keep her mouth from opening as she caught her breath. Her friends clutched their weapons at her reaction and shock. The priest held up both hands with his palms open and facing them. “Then I can bring him in here. He was prepared if you were unwilling to go outside. If you will allow me.” Without waiting for confirmation, Cyrus turned and made for the door. His escort of guards didn’t make a move to follow him. Sholeh spun toward her friends. Her mind raced in the desperation of what was going on. Her eyes found Kincaid first. “By all that is holy, I am sorry.” “Sholeh, it’s ok. Who is waiting for you? Making all of this effort secure us in this building?” Before she could answer the question, a pair of knights in full armor strode into the room. They wore conical helmets with points at the top, mail covered the vulnerable areas of their neck. Gleaming breastplates reflected the low light in the room. They moved forward into the room, stopped two paces away from the group, and waited. A moment later, a small man walked into the bar. He was a balding man with piercing brown eyes. The left side of his mouth was turned upward in a permanent smile that would appear to most as a sneer. Sholeh remembered the fight that left him with the damage all too well. His clothes were rich enough for an emperor, although he didn’t risk the emperor's ire by wearing royal purple. Sholeh was sure he hadn’t figured out how to do that yet. “I have tried every way to get in touch with you, Sholeh. I have gone through so much effort for us to get back together and meet. You just have no idea.” “I do. I remember leaving the bodies behind, avoiding your spies, and fleeing the city. As I returned, you sent more to find me. More bodies.” “I did not want our reunion to be this way.” “By all that is holy, I did not want a reunion. There is nothing left for us.” “Blasphemer.” The word croaked from the deepest part of his chest. “In the presence of the church and her holy servants.” “Come now, father. I have seen you on your less than holy days. I am sure even your bodyguards are convinced that you are not always the anointed one.” “Your father? This priest is your father?” Kincaid’s voice was choked with disbelief. Normally, her father wouldn’t bother to speak to the lowest supplicants. But he graced Kincaid with a look. “Not a priest, foreigner. Patriarch of the church.” Sholeh couldn’t meet Kincaid’s look, and her other companions stayed ready for action. If only she knew how this would develop. “You made quite the journey to come down from the Inner City to see me. I imagine coming to the dock district was enough to make you think twice. No one of power here.” “You mistreat your father, Sholeh,” Cyrus said. Sholeh’s anger exploded in her chest. “You of all people know better than that. You were there when he made his choices. My mother. My brother. Me. Unfair is not a word I would choose.” “Sholeh, there is a time for forgiveness. A time for us to start over. I would like a chance to do that with my daughter. If you will let me.” “No, I did not come back to Pilaetium for this.” “Then, why return?” Her father’s face wrinkled above the eyebrows. The deep lines were signs of his advancing age. “I came back for him.” She pointed back at Kincaid. “My friend needed something here in Pilaetium, and I hoped I would never have to see you again.” “A man. I thought you were better than that.” “He is better than all of us.” Please, no magic now, she thought. Give me one more moment to get rid of him. The risk was too high to display power here. “I wish you felt otherwise. Even after all these years, you still do not have enough love in your heart to start over again. Typical.” “Not typical. What you brought me up to be. You sacrificed everything for your power and your place. You sacrificed our love on your altar of aspiration. You are beyond my forgiveness.” Her father’s lips moved. The corner of his mouth ticked from the old injury. The guards stood motionless and disinterested in the family argument. No words, no commands came forward from his effort. “How long will you stay?” “Why does it matter?” “It seemed to be the polite thing to ask.” “Politeness does not suit you, father. I expected the conniving efforts to bring me back into your camp. Find a way to marry me off to a political opponent. Or worse.” “I would like to be a concerned father for a moment—” “You gave up that right. We will only stay until we can find safe passage away from the city. The Empire will not have to worry about us for very long.” “There are many in the inner circle who are interested in you and your friends, Sholeh. In a short amount of time, you’ve created new enemies. I can help you from within.” “Help? Help? The only one you will ever help is yourself. You would betray your very church if it gave you—” “Sholeh, that’s enough.” Cyrus barked the command between them. He was the only one with the courage and background to interrupt the patriarch. He might even live to see tomorrow’s dawn. “I am sorry that I hurt you in this way.” “It was not just me. I can not even imagine how many others you hurt on your path to power. I do not want to do this, father.” The patriarch hung his head low, the sting of defeat watering his eyes. “You should leave the city very quickly. The emperor is looking for your friend. He is very interested in what he can do, and the others are wanted. Someone has an axe to grind with them. I will not help you. But I will also not resist.” With those few words, he turned and left the room. His personal bodyguard accompanied him. Cyrus stayed for a moment longer. “He was ready to try, Sholeh.” “I was not.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Challenge",
      "content": "Kincaid - Challenge Sholeh disappeared to their room, and Kincaid wanted to support her. His heart broke with her pain, but she placed a hand on his chest as he turned to accompany her upstairs. He didn’t understand how she could face this pain alone. But he cared too much to hurt her again by following. Sigurd headed for the docks to purchase passage. They weren’t picky for destinations, as long as they could leave the capital quickly. All of them understood the highest levels of power would hunt them down. Kincaid wondered how they would pay for ocean passage for the four of them. Better not ask the thief how he would get the job done. Adelaise offered to guard the inn. She’d be ready in case Sigurd got into trouble, or others came looking for the group. Of the four, she was the calmest in the middle of the changes. It was just another day for the mercenary. Kincaid went out toward the docks and looked toward the straights. Sunlight glinted off the water as sea birds paddled their way along the shores. Calls of birds looking for food added to the nearby noise of people grunting under the load of their work by the ships. Wood, metal, and rope worked together in the dock environment. Kincaid sat and crossed his legs. The sunlight warmed his face and drove away his darkest thoughts. The briny smell filled his lungs, and he filtered out the noises. He reached out with his magic to the arcane plane. You’ve figured this out. I knew you were somehow connected to the magic, but I’ve always been on the run without time to think. My experience with magic has been too short, Kincaid thought. Maybe I am more than just connected to the magic. Have you considered this in your thoughts? From the images of the prison, I can only imagine what you might be, Kincaid thought. He wondered how he could converse with something beyond his senses, and he considered how much this other voice could see into his mind. I wondered which one of you would win—fascinating displays of power. Wait, you knew? My two strongest disciples, fighting for ascendancy. Of course, I knew. And you wanted this? Far more than wanted this. I needed to see who would win a contest of magic and a clash of wills. I now know. I don’t understand. I wouldn’t expect you to. But you surprised me. He was so much stronger than you. Strength turns out to not be everything in this world. That’s one thing I learned here in Pilaetium. His drive to claim power was impressive. He was willing to sacrifice everything to be the most fantastic wizard the world has ever seen. He did sacrifice everything. I claimed it. You have a different power and a different strength. You are interesting where the others are amusing. I need to understand more about you. I need to understand who you are. Why do you focus on the who? Maybe you should consider the what. The images you gave me. I’m going to assume you gave them to me. They didn’t come true. Not like Caesea. Time is a fascinating thing. You measure time to count the days to your death. You may learn to understand more and what your visions mean. Kincaid closed off the connection to the arcane plane, and the voice mercifully left his mind. A voice. But connected to what? And how could he be a disciple? Schools at every turn had rejected him. Even Magi Cormac didn’t live long enough to explain more than the fundamentals of magic and his darkest secret. Pilaetium brought him new enemies and challenges with their hecaerae. Learning in this manner was dangerous business. Kincaid opened his eyes and looked out at the peaceful water. A ship made its way from the docks. Men and women scurried across the deck and up the rigging. Sails snapped to life in the breeze even as the ropes and wood groaned. Even from the shoreline, Kincaid heard the wood make its noises. The water parted at the prow and made waves behind the bulk of the ship. Magic must be like the water. Deep and powerful. The ship was the human soul, groaning under the pressure of the unseen elements. Currents and tides, wind and rain. All fought to claim the vessel as it made its way to its destination. The most influential captains caught the attention of merchants and kings. Kincaid wondered if being a magi was the same as being a skilled captain. The metaphor didn’t work. Kincaid could shape the tides and currents with the power of his will. The weather was his to control and shape. And when he did, the ship would be destroyed by the swirling powers around him. The sight was beautiful to his eyes, but his unsettled mind couldn’t make the metaphor work right. If the sea was the arcane plane, then what was the voice? How could he see into the future or get these visions? More questions that he struggled to answer. Someone had to have more knowledge about the powers of magic. The price of magic was terrifying. Even if someone knew more, would they even be alive long enough to pass down their findings? What if the secrets were too dark for anyone to record? He had to push those thoughts aside. Doubts wouldn’t get them out of the city, and languishing in dark thoughts didn’t serve him well. He needed more time and opportunity to work all of this out in his head. “A great deal of water, yes?” the voice was low. Sigurd lowered himself to the ground and offered Kincaid a jug. Without asking what it was, Kincaid took a long pull of the thick brew. It wasn’t even that bad. “Are you sure a ship is the right way to go?” “On land, everyone can find us and get ahead. At sea, we only have the crew.” “Until we get to our destination. Anyone will be able to talk to people on the dock and find out where we are going. They can get ahead of us.” “This is true. But doing things past the Empire is much easier, yes? Not as strong as we head away from this place.” “Did you find our passage?” “A place to walk? Many passages in this big city.” Kincaid didn’t bother to hide his grin. “A ship.” “Yes, many good ships at the dock. We will not take one to Caesea, yes?” Kincaid raised an eyebrow as he looked at the large northerner’s blue eyes. “Then farther north. Perhaps to the Northern States.” “Probably the best choice of any.” Kincaid shared the rest of the ale with Sigurd as they looked out at the straights. The Northern States was as good as any other location. He was from the lands of one of the dukes. And so was Magi Cormac. Kincaid struggled with the memories of the prison. They’d talked about his initial efforts with magic in the Northern States. The time before he traveled to Caesea and trained the sorceratti. There were experiments with magic back then. Before the sorceratti. The same time as the hecaerae? Hope lit Kincaid’s heart as he considered the next events they’d face. But first, he needed to talk to Sholeh. He wouldn’t be able to do anything without her.",

      "content": "Fire Liquid fires of magic burned through Lin’s soul. Pain pumped through her veins, but her senses never felt so alive. Every hair on her skin ignited with the touch of air on her bare arms. The drone of the ever-present flies in the tannery deafened her hearing. Lin was alive in a way that only those who could touch the power of magic could understand. Magic burned from the inside out. Channeling a stream of this power, Lin crafted a flame in the palm of her hand by imagining a candle. Magic responded to her desire. The fire flickered into being and lit the room with a blue glow. The flame had no heat, and it did not need fuel. Her arcane experiment moved up and down her fingers, and Lin commanded the fire to dance across her palm. Lin tried to hold back her laughter and held on to the flow of magic. She was alive. She was more alive than ever with each use of her gift. “Lin! What are you doing?” Uh oh. She winced and closed off the flow of magic. The flame snuffed out without the telltale sign of smoke, and the darkness of the room overwhelmed her. The collapse of power left her senses in the dark, and a part of her soul was gone, empty. She was in the same place she had been for fourteen years. “Ummmm… hold on.” “Lin.” Lin knew what she was supposed to be doing. But she panicked with the insistent tone in her adoptive father’s voice. She took too long to fetch the water buckets. Her hands grasped for the iron handles and missed. Her knuckles throbbed with the impact. The wooden bucket crashed to the floor and rolled around. Caught. “What are you doing? Get those buckets and get out here.” Stars flooded her vision as Lin bent down to pick up the bucket and slammed her forehead into the wall. The blow knocked her back on her heels, and curse words jumped to her mind. Tired of hiding this. Should just light this place with magic. Better to turn the tannery to ashes and get out of here. The panic and the injury clouded her mind, and the arcane force felt out of reach. She couldn’t touch the power; she couldn’t sense it. Lin found the buckets in the dark. The door latch resisted her fumbling thumb’s pressure. The polished wood finally gave way with a thump. She shoved the door open, and the oak door banged against the wall. Lin grabbed the buckets and strode into the room. “Here’s the buckets, Johannes.” Her voice sounded guilty to her own ears. Not the defiant tone she wanted. Johannes didn’t look up as he hunched over a massive vat of bubbling and hissing fluids. He perched a wooden platform and clenched a board crafted like a thick oar in his curled hands. Arms stirred without pause in a practiced motion she’d seen him perform for hundreds of hours. Churning chemicals to tan leather was a menial task. Without looking up from his labor, he said, “What’re you doing, Lin?” She hated that accusing voice. She was wrong for hiding in the storage area and felt guilty. But now he gave her that fatherly disappointment. Lin couldn’t think fast enough when he used that voice, so she had to go with the half-truth. “Fumbling in the dark for the bucket. Banged my head as I was picking them up.” “Didn’t know the storage closet would be dark?” Didn’t work. Lin crossed her arms across her chest, shifted her weight to her back foot, and looked him square in the eyes. She dared him to question her. Johannes took in a deep breath and sighed. “Lin, when you’d come to my shop four years ago, didn’t want you. No place for a girl with no family, no money, and no desire. Let you stay—” “Johannes, I’m—” “No.” The emotion tore through Lin’s heart and melted her stance. He was right, and he did take her in when there was nowhere to turn. “Kept you around because you worked hard and could be good at this. No wife, no sons, and being alone was work. You’ve been faithful—” “I’m sorry.” Johannes looked her in the eyes as he stopped his churning motion. “Know you are, but we got to finish this leather. Can’t do this alone.” He can’t, and Lin knew it. She grabbed the two heavy buckets and walked toward the door. As she passed, Johannes let go of his long board and wrapped an arm around her. Not a full hug, Johannes wasn’t like that. Lin knew she wouldn’t get the lecture on loafing. She smelled sweat, and the tonics of tanning permeating his apron. But it was his scent and the first in her young life she could remember. Lin couldn’t stand the smells of the tannery, but she couldn’t live without them. * * * Lin’s arms were exhausted. Her back burned as she tried to straighten with the load filling her arms. The stack of leather armor pieces weighed more after Johannes’ process. She wished Johannes would hire help or take on another apprentice. At least someone else could help move the finished products into storage. That wasn’t going to happen. The last breastplate would fit on top of the pile of finished armor. Lin didn’t have time to rebuild another stack, and Johannes hated uneven piles. Heaps of different heights proved she didn’t plan ahead, and he didn’t want to give customers the idea he didn’t do good work. She gave one last lift and reached to the top of her toes. Done for the day. Please don’t fall over. Her hands scrambled to hold the stack of armor up, but the weight was too much. She scurried out from under the collapsing pile. “Lin, armor better not be scratched. You’ll be polishing it ‘til sunrise if it is.” “Let me clean it up.” What a mess. Each piece of armor must weigh twenty pounds, and the entire stack was on the ground. Lin’s body registered the bruises from the crash, and her exhausted mind wanted to let go and cry. Her stomach growled. Why didn’t I grab the ladder? Now she’d sit and stack the lowest level again. She steeled herself for the task and began to rebuild each pile. Lost in her thoughts, the banging on the door to the tannery startled Lin. She panicked as she looked at the work she still had to clean up. They had two days to finish the current contract with the Duke. Johannes wouldn’t take on more jobs until he was done with this one, his biggest deal yet. Tears welled in her eyes. She couldn’t work more hours than she was putting in. The voices coming from the work area were loud. Lin wondered why they were shouting, so she slipped closer to the door and tried to make out the words. She peeked through the cracked door and saw the fires under the massive iron vats glowed a deep red. But it was enough light to make out the visitors. A pair of men faced off against Johannes in the deepening gloom of the tannery. They didn’t have the fancy clothes of the Duke’s men, and they didn’t carry themselves like merchants. Lin watched as Johannes crossed his arms over his chest and shook his head. The men turned and left. She wished she heard the conversation.",

      "content": "About the Author Writing for work or academics is not the same as writing what an author loves. For Mark August, his passion for fantasy came from late nights of page-turning reading. In 2016, his older daughter challenged him to Camp National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), and storytelling emerged from a dormant childhood dream. Camp NaNo and NaNoWriMo every year is now a tradition. In 2020, the pieces came together with a Writers of the Future Honorable Mention for a short story based on a Chronomancer character. Mark is a proud USAF veteran, husband to his high school sweetheart who inspires him to write, and father to four amazing kids starting their own lives. Someday, Mark and his wife will settle down in their forever home, finally moving past \"Home is where the Air Force sends us.\" For more books and updates: readmarkaugust.com Facebook Instagram",

      "title": "Kincaid - Consequences",
      "content": "Kincaid - Consequences Fight or starve. Kincaid wiped blood from his mouth with the back of his hand. The smear ran up to his sleeve, and the grime tasted like dirt and iron. His left fist clutched the ground for balance; he was no longer an apprentice carpenter. He brought his fists in front of his face and stared up at the giant in the ring. The shirtless man was twice his height. A broad chest rippled with strength as he clapped his palms together, and an empty mouth of shattered teeth grinned. He gestured for Kincaid to launch the next attack. The crowd gathered in the old warehouse erupted with the display of sportsmanship. They were getting their money’s worth in this David versus Goliath competition. The fighter was a favorite of the town and defeated everyone on the coast of Caesea, and Kincaid played those odds. Fight or starve. He needed to win. Kincaid nodded his appreciation for the showmanship, which allowed him to steady his balance. The man’s blows were lightning fast for his size, and he hit like a horse’s hoof. Another blow like that and Kincaid would be out. Unwilling to take more risk, Kincaid opened his heart, mind, and soul to the forces of magic. He summoned a trickle of power into his soul, and his senses exploded around him. He filtered the noises and the faces of the crowd and focused on his opponent. The giant wasn’t breathing hard, and the first droplet of sweat formed on his brow. His heart thumped in anticipation, not fatigue. Kincaid wouldn't wear this man down. Where did he get this endurance? Pain disappeared with the magic pounding in his veins. The arcane power was music longing to rise from a soft beat to a crescendo. Magic pushed against his restraint and hungered for explosive release. Kincaid struggled for control with the arcane might at his command for less than a heartbeat, and the young man heard the giant’s boots creak. Sportsman or not, he wasn’t waiting. The courtesy of the fight was over, and the giant would finish the contest with a flourish. Spectators expected their winnings. The man was a trained fighter. As he closed into range, he balanced his weight forward on his feet, and his arms covered his face and upper chest. His entire body bobbed to the sides to get Kincaid to commit in a direction. The best the carpenter could do was stay out of reach. Tired of the retreating target, the giant surged forward. He led with a left jab with the length of a lance. Kincaid heard the muscles tense and explode outward. The small fighter pulled his body to the right and around the powerful punch. Kincaid threw his right fist and contacted the man’s ribs with the thud of bone against muscle. The crowd hushed as the impact forced a grunt from the giant. Before the first punch registered, Kincaid leveraged his surprise and landed a left straight in the giant’s gut. The blow cracked the tension, and the crowd exploded with cheers. Money clanked and changed hands. The favorite backed up and rubbed his chest. Kincaid’s blows were impossibly strong. The fighter's eyes were wide with confusion, but Kincaid wouldn’t share the secret of his powerful strikes. Fight or starve. Kincaid’s visions of victory distracted him from the moment, and the giant gave no quarter in this ring. Kincaid wasn’t paying attention as the blow smashed his forehead. His vision exploded with stars, and his legs turned to mush from the impact. His mind screamed to watch for the next inbound strike to his face even as his body refused to obey the command. The surge of magic saved his life as he knocked aside the jab with his forearm. Disbelief registered on the giant’s face. Recovering from the punishment but only looking through one unswollen eye, Kincaid launched his counterblow. His right fist impacted the man’s chin. Kincaid felt the stubble of the man’s beard on his knuckles as the giant rocked back on his heels. The young wizard hammered blows to the body. Thud followed crack as the fists hit like a smith’s hammer. Even the giant's iron body surrendered to the impacts, bending, twisting, and losing strength. The favorite never threw another punch. The magic coursing through Kincaid’s being howled in delight. Warmth of the torches and oil lamps beckoned for Kincaid’s senses. A blast of arcane energy could melt down any opponent standing in front of him. Start your conquest. Finish this fight. Make yourself king. The voice pounded in his skull with each beat of his heart. It had been silent since his duel with Vedette Atros, daughter of the ruling house of Caesea. Their battle led to destruction beyond their wildest imagination. City blocks buried; lives destroyed. He couldn’t do that now, not here. He thrust those thoughts aside. Two more blows powered by his seething anger finished the bout. The giant dropped his arms on the last blow and collapsed backward like a felled tree. Dirt bounced as his body hit the ground. He wouldn’t rise again tonight. Kincaid struggled with the flow of magic as he turned to the crowd. Faces leered with joy, and some growled with hatred. Silver coins passed between gamblers as the carpenter stood alone in the eerie silence of the ring. The fight organizers came forward to the inexperienced fighter, and neither had a pleasant look on their face. “Cheater.” Kincaid shook his head as he fought to get his breath back. “No way you could beat Granite at your size.” The man was from one of the Northern States with his light skin and blue eyes. He was middle-aged, soft, and in control of the fighting venture. Right to where the upset changed everything. He fumed. “Then why go through with the fight? Just let the opponents stand next to each other and let the fans decide.” Sweat dripped as Kincaid shook his head. “They demand a show.” “Not your first match.” The accusation hung in the air. Kincaid allowed the smile to cross his lips. “I’ll take my winnings.” “May let people in this crowd take your life.” “Want to go a round with me?” Kincaid shifted his relaxed posture. He curled his hands into fists and gestured toward the fallen fighter, Granite. Back to fight or starve. The man’s eyes darted toward the immobile champion and the favorite of the night. He looked toward his silent partner, who only gave a nod. “You best get out of here before I change my mind.” Kincaid stepped up to the speaker's face. Inches away from his nose, Kincaid recoiled from the tobacco and alcohol on the man’s breath. “Not until you give me my due. Winner’s fees, now. Or I start the next round right here.” Kincaid would let the man throw the first shot. Just one punch, and then he’d take him. The organizer considered that exact move. But he was an actor on this stage and grabbed Kincaid’s forearm. They faced the crowd, and the organizer thrust Kincaid’s arm toward the ceiling. The fans roared with the victory. Applause thundered across the warehouse. “You come back here, and we’ll kill you.” “Give me my winnings, and I won’t be back.” The silent partner came forward and handed the young victor his bag of silver. There’d be more from the bookies. Kincaid had terrible odds going into the fight, and his small bet could go a long way into surviving a few more days. They wouldn’t starve tonight. Sholeh was waiting for the bruised fighter as he staggered through the door of their room in the broken-down inn. This was what they could afford, and they were late for their last week’s payment. The look on her face flashed from anger to concern as she saw the glowing purple bruises on his face. “By all that is holy, Kincaid, you are fighting again?” She got up from her bed and took two steps toward him. Her soft touch brushed aside the wild shock of his red hair and probed the swelling around his eyes. Kincaid choked back his emotions. “I don’t know how else we can eat and sleep, Sholeh. We’re weeks past the fight in Caesea, and we’re stuck in this harbor town. Atros can find us.” “Did you use magic?” Kincaid turned away from her touch and looked toward the floor. “By all that is good. You will lead Atros and the City Council to us with your magic.” “We’re a long way across the bay.” “But close enough that an agent will find us. There are only so many harbors we could have escaped to. They will not find us in the city, and the towns will be next.” “I can’t let you starve, Sholeh. We’re already—” “I know. But we can do this together, my friend. You do not have to carry this weight across your shoulders.” Kincaid looked toward his few sheets and makeshift pillow on the floor of the room. They could fit both of their belongings in a small sack. They sold the few tools Sholeh had left from her blacksmith trade a week ago, and those funds were dangerously low. Their clothes were their few remaining possessions. “We need to get to the Empire, Sholeh.” “Magic.” The accusation was a whisper. This wasn’t the first time they had this discussion. “Yes. I don’t know what else to do. Magi Cormac gave me that last instruction before I…” Sholeh waited for the lengthy pause. “You had to kill him to survive. And we are alive today.” The anger once in her tone was long gone. She supported him with his emotional burden. “I can’t let us starve, Sholeh. And we can’t stay here. How do we earn enough to get out of here?” “Work together. We know we cannot afford passage on a ship, so we must focus on land travel. A caravan.” Kincaid’s power could destroy city blocks, and only his imagination limited his arcane ability. But the actual source of his strength stood next to him. When his soul ached, Sholeh filled the emptiness. Every time he used magic, his fatigue deepened. It was a fatigue that didn’t get better with rest, and Kincaid knew he sacrificed his soul with each use. He rested his willpower on the strong shoulders of his friend. “At least we won’t starve tonight. Will you get food while I change?” Sholeh nodded once, grabbed the smallest coin from the bag of winnings and walked downstairs to the inn to see what was left from dinner. The fight would begin again tomorrow.",

The look on her face flashed from anger to concern as she saw the glowing purple bruises on his face. “By all that is holy, Kincaid, you are fighting again?” She got up from her bed and took two steps toward him. Her soft touch brushed aside the wild shock of his red hair and probed the swelling around his eyes. Kincaid choked back his emotions. “I don’t know how else we can eat and sleep, Sholeh. We’re weeks past the fight in Caesea, and we’re stuck in this harbor town. Atros can find us.” “Did you use magic?” Kincaid turned away from her touch and looked toward the floor. “By all that is good. You will lead Atros and the City Council to us with your magic.” “We’re a long way across the bay.” “But close enough that an agent will find us. There are only so many harbors we could have escaped to. They will not find us in the city, and the towns will be next.” “I can’t let you starve, Sholeh. We’re already—” “I know. But we can do this together, my friend. You do not have to carry this weight across your shoulders.” Kincaid looked toward his few sheets and makeshift pillow on the floor of the room. They could fit both of their belongings in a small sack. They sold the few tools Sholeh had left from her blacksmith trade a week ago, and those funds were dangerously low. Their clothes were their few remaining possessions. “We need to get to the Empire, Sholeh.” “Magic.” The accusation was a whisper. This wasn’t the first time they had this discussion. “Yes. I don’t know what else to do. Magi Cormac gave me that last instruction before I…” Sholeh waited for the lengthy pause. “You had to kill him to survive. And we are alive today.” The anger once in her tone was long gone. She supported him with his emotional burden. “I can’t let us starve, Sholeh. And we can’t stay here. How do we earn enough to get out of here?” “Work together. We know we cannot afford passage on a ship, so we must focus on land travel. A caravan.” Kincaid’s power could destroy city blocks, and only his imagination limited his arcane ability. But the actual source of his strength stood next to him. When his soul ached, Sholeh filled the emptiness. Every time he used magic, his fatigue deepened. It was a fatigue that didn’t get better with rest, and Kincaid knew he sacrificed his soul with each use. He rested his willpower on the strong shoulders of his friend. “At least we won’t starve tonight. Will you get food while I change?” Sholeh nodded once, grabbed the smallest coin from the bag of winnings and walked downstairs to the inn to see what was left from dinner. The fight would begin again tomorrow.",

      "content": "Sholeh - Working for a Living Using magic in the lands of Caesea was punishable by death. After they escaped from the island capital, Kincaid and Sholeh couldn’t afford to travel farther inland and were still within the city leadership’s reach. With this latest brawl, Kincaid risked discovery by powerful forces again, and the risk grew each day. Sholeh lay awake, staring at the rotting timbers of their ceiling as Kincaid rolled in his thin blanket and wrestled against unseen demons. His mind and body engaged in a fight she couldn’t explain. Sholeh didn’t pretend to understand magic or its consequences to its user. Until Kincaid emerged from prison, she didn’t know her friend wielded arcane power. The changes were astounding. Once a prodigy carpenter ready to make a worldwide name in his craft, he was now a hardened man forced from one tough choice to the next by events beyond his control. The fight tonight was an example of his decision-making. He slipped away, claiming he was looking for a job, and found another off-the-record match. By his reasoning, it was the right thing to do. Sholeh blinked away the tear because he had to lie to her. She knew he was running out of options with locations because he always won against the ring favorite. They had to find a way out of Caesean lands. Years ago, Kincaid and his sister arrived in Caesea and worked their way up from the bottom as poverty-stricken immigrants. A craftsmaster took them in and shared the secrets of his art. Everything changed with Kincaid’s arcane power. Now he was a man with unimaginable potential running from the authorities. Sholeh’s heart broke each point he slid into terrible choices. Magic had a severe cost, and she’d seen it in her friend’s eyes. Kincaid told her his very soul was at stake each moment he wielded his magic. Lessons from her time in the churches in the Empire of a Thousand Spears glorified the immortal human soul, and decisions a person made directed their soul’s immortality into an afterlife. Kincaid’s experience with arcane power shook the foundations of faith. Sholeh couldn’t wait. Kincaid needed her help as much as she needed him. She wasn’t a frail maiden waiting for rescue. While he tossed and turned on the floor, Sholeh rose to gather her things and dressed in the frosty air of the room. She slipped out the door in the pre-dawn light. The harbor town was in motion with the anticipation of the outgoing tide. Shouts from people used to the demands of their trade echoed in the streets up from the docks. In the morning gloom, Sholeh trudged her way to the busy bodies of sailors, laborers, and stevedores racing against the unforgiving tide. Sholeh trained as a blacksmith for years in both the Empire and Caesea, and she considered going to the docks to make her living with the hardened strength in her arms. But she couldn’t afford to get crossways with the Porters’ Guild. She might make a few copper pennies, but she and Kincaid didn’t need another powerful enemy. She turned away from the water lapping against the wooden pillars and slapping against the ships' hulls. The town was a haphazard placement of makeshift buildings hugging the shoreline. Sholeh wondered if the town even had a name. The natural harbor was a boon for trade, and people who couldn’t afford to live in the island capital in the center of the bay settled in scattered villages along the coastline, hoping to profit from the excess of Caesea. Streets were often empty, just dirty spaces between homes, and frequently too narrow or twisty for a single wagon to travel the length. Smoke rose from the chimneys of bakers and smiths. Daily labor began at the call of the morning bells, but apprentices stoked the fires to the correct temperature long before sunrise. Her fingers itched to find a way into one of these forges and show her skill. Voices lifted to meet the dawn and challenged the clatter from the docks. Not shouts or curses: a song. Sholeh’s heart leaped for a moment as more voices joined the refrain. The hymn was off key and yet pure in its intent—simple words to greet the rising sun. The hills burned with the reddish morning glow. Another triumphant arrival of a new day. The song of morning light. Sholeh faced the ghosts of her past. The church was a plain structure of wood and stone. The few parishioners couldn’t afford a cathedral with lofty spires hungering for the touch of the heavens. This building was modest, a single floor that looked like a barn or warehouse. A lone bell tower climbed above the rooftop, the only distinguishing feature to separate the chapel from the town's other buildings. The bell rang out in observance of another day. Celebration wasn’t on Sholeh’s mind. She couldn’t bring herself to join the voices and stood outside as light claimed the morning skies. Other bells tolled across the port, marking the start of the day. The echoes of the human voices joined in song faded as the creaky door swung open. Men and women covered in the drab of ordinary workers headed forth into the city. The priest of this flock wore long black robes that hung in the dirt in the street. A plain leather belt wrapped around his stout middle. The only adornment to the simple garb was a thin red line at the edge of each sleeve and the hem at his feet. “Greetings, sister. The morning light shine upon your face.” Sholeh’s feet froze in place as ice pumped through her veins. The voice pushed against her memories. Forgotten memories. “May the morning glow light your path.” The priest raised his eyebrows at the traditional response to the formal morning prayer. He tucked his hands into the cuffs of his robes. “A sister far from home. Returning to the church?” Sholeh broke her gaze from the man and looked at the squalid building and the slipshod work. Coming home. Had her life come to this? “No. I still need to find what I am looking for.” “The goal of all people is to discover their place in a greater plan.” “What happens if we never find it?” The priest fidgeted with his belt. The theological debate was unusual in the town’s streets. “But the quest itself is the journey, sister. How could it be otherwise?” “The quest must have an ending. Every journey needs a goal.” “The goal would be eternity.” “But at what cost to your soul?” Words tumbled out faster than she could control them. Years ago, she left this behind to find herself. And now she was arguing with the church again. “You must seek…” The words trailed off as the priest took another step closer. “Sholeh?” “By all that is good and holy…” “It is you. The wayward daughter is found.” “Baris? Of all places.” “I passed my test and earned the red ring. I tend to the souls here.” “Of all places.” “Your father will be overjoyed—\" “Baris, you can’t report this.” “We’ve searched across the Empire.” “Keep looking.” “He will want to know.” “He cannot. I will not be here long enough for a message to get to him. Do you wish to let my father know you lost me?” “I don’t understand.” “You cannot. Things are complicated.” “Then explain.” Sholeh’s eyes moved from the church back to the preacher. He was genuine, and the concern dated back to a time when they were children. She shrugged out of his grasp. “I cannot. I am sorry.” She spun on her heel away from the dumbfounded priest and strode down the street. She dared not look back. Her feet followed the sounds of the pounding hammers. The ring of the steel slowed her heart and settled her soul. A different home. As she walked in, one worker grounded her hammer and wiped the grime of her hands on the leather apron. The apprentice working the bellows behind her took a thankful pause from the unrelenting work. “What do you need?” The brown eyes sized up Sholeh with the practiced look of a hardened businesswoman. She rested her hand on the counter dividing the forge from the rest of the shop. Muscles rippled, and sweat covered the bare forearms. No stranger to the anvil. “I need work.” “Swing hammers before?” “Yes.” “I can’t pay you until I see your skill. No pay for a week and no guarantees for pay afterward.” Sholeh’s shoulders slumped forward. She couldn’t let this offer defeat her. It was better than any she’d gotten since their escape. “Take it or leave it.” The woman turned to her forge, and the apprentice pumped the bellow to bring the flames back to life. Sholeh picked up a leather apron pocked with burns and stained with sweat. She strode into the heat of the forge and tested the weight of the hammers. “I need three pounds of nails. Two-inch length.” Sholeh didn’t say another word to the apprentice-level work. She hammered out her frustration on the yielding iron. How would she explain the day to Kincaid?",

      "title": "Kincaid - Visitors",
      "content": "Kincaid - Visitors His soul labored with the scars of his magic. A deep, dreamless sleep didn’t drive away the fatigue. Not this fatigue. His body groaned from a night on the drafty room’s frigid floor, and the pain was deeper than his muscles and his bones. This is what it feels like to be old. The thought of aging before his time from his power wracked his mind with awful memories. The image of Vedette Atros, the youngest child of the powerful House of Atros, clinging to life in her ancient body lying in the street seared into his mind’s eye. He turned away from those terrible images. They wouldn’t be his future. Sholeh’s bed was tidy, neat, and empty. Although his sleep was restless, he couldn’t recall her dressing to leave before dawn. Kincaid shook his head and hoped she wasn’t laboring at another day job. They needed time to plan to spend his small winnings and get out of here. But first, breakfast. His stomach reminded him they survived on one meal a day to stretch their last coins. He kicked his blankets to the corner of the room and tightened his belt. Drafts from the approaching winter raced through the common area and caused the fire to flicker and sputter. The floor creaked with his footsteps. Too few nails in lumber any carpenter would reject. At least the area was empty after the laborers responded to the morning bells. He ran a copper penny between his fingers as he gestured to the working staff. As he took his perch in the corner on an uneven stool that rocked with his weight, a blast of approaching winter air surged from the main door. Two men stepped through the opening and slammed the door shut behind them. Their eyes probed the inn’s main floor and glared into each shadow. Each wore thick padded armor painted with a checkerboard of red and white squares. Belted swords and daggers hung at each hip, and both carried a long spear. Rather than rest their spears and settle into seats, one turned to open the door again. The common room staff didn’t appear scared, only curious. Quite a show. In a moment, a man and a woman strode in from the street. Neither bore the hardened looks of warriors nor carried an array of weapons. They were more dangerous. These two had the haughty air of nobility. Disgust for the inn was visible across the room. Kincaid considered his options for escape. He had none. Any movement to the stairs back to his room would draw the attention of the alert guards, and slipping out the door was impossible as he’d have to approach the noble guests. He kept his head down and traced the grain of the wood on the table. The nobles stepped to the bar to summon the owner, and Kincaid couldn’t decipher the words out of the voices' low rumble. Guards moved deeper into the room and took notice of the single patron waiting for breakfast. The door opened a last time, and two more guards entered. Both wore the same coat of arms. Six to one. They couldn’t be looking for him. He wasn’t worth that much attention. Unless they were from Atros, but the guards from Atros wore red with golden lions. Kincaid fought to control his heart rate under the scrutiny. The intensity of the stares didn’t change; they viewed him as a threat. The exchanged words were low but insistent as the man and woman probed for information. None of the people at the bar turned toward Kincaid, but the flow of conversation demanded answers. Kincaid summoned a trickle of arcane energy, fighting back the rush that hungered to claim his soul. With the smallest stream of power, the young wizard pushed his senses out to the edges of the room. The stiff padded armor crunched from the weapons' weight on the belts, and the thick boots squeaked against the loose floorboards. The guards’ breathing were normal as they conducted their duties. They didn’t view Kincaid as a threat. He forced his hearing to the conversation with the barkeep, and the words stopped in mid-sentence. The man and woman spun toward Kincaid. Each summoned a channel of their strength and shoved the force of magic back toward him. Kincaid’s heart raced as he faced the wizards. Their power was deep and honed to precise levels. His flow of magic was crude compared to their touch of the arcane. And they could toss aside his childish efforts with their magic. Kincaid’s expanded senses collapsed around him. The woman and a man approached Kincaid. The halo of power surrounded their bodies as they waved off the guards. Pausing two steps away, they sized up Kincaid. He straightened his back, raised an eyebrow, and endured their gaze. Their clothes were less garish than the red and white checkered armor of the escorts, but their clothes were also unique. Each wore long robes from their necks to an inch above the floorboards. The fine silk material fell perfectly across their bodies and flowed as they walked. Even the ruling houses of Caesea had a limited supply of this imported material. Their garment's right sleeve was sky blue, and each had gold thread, less than an inch wide at their wrists, and the opposite sleeve carried the red and white checkered pattern of the guards. The middle of the clothing was forest green with a competing inch of gold at the bottom. Both wore crafted leather belts with only an eating knife and a pouch. They approached the table and stopped by the remaining chairs. “A moment of your time, wizard?” The man’s voice gave away his teenage years with a squeak at the end of the sentence. His body was older—the price of magic. Brown eyes probed into Kincaid’s soul. Kincaid gestured to the two chairs in front of him with an open palm. The young magi remained seated as they joined him at the uneven table. “Why use magic against us?” The woman was to the point and more guarded than her companion. “You should have known we would feel the push of power.” “We’d have to respond,” the man said. “I didn’t know you used magic.” The pair glanced at each other, and the stone mask of interrogation slipped from their faces. The chairs creaked and groaned as they shifted their weight. Kincaid was relieved the guards with their weapons and armor didn’t join them as they would crush the chairs. “You couldn’t tell by our rank?” The question was bait, but Kincaid didn’t have a choice. “I’ve never seen those uniforms before, and I don’t understand what you mean by rank. But your conversation at the bar worried me.” “Don’t the laws of this city punish magic with execution?” The woman’s voice was low but directive. “Yes, and they’ve tried. But the city is busier with other things than a poor immigrant.” “I see your point.” The man nodded in an annoying all-knowing fashion so typical of nobility. “We do not come from the city or represent any of the misguided noble houses. But I should ask first, are you sorceratti?” the woman asked. Kincaid snorted. “Absolutely not. Do I even look like a native Caesean?” “There have been indiscretions in the past. Not of the sorceratti, of course.” The man’s voice shifted into a lecturing tone. For a moment, Kincaid missed the words of Magi Cormac. Kincaid couldn’t figure out why people always needed to explain things to him. “I am Petre, first rank of the Theurgia, hecaerae.” “And I am Tereza, second rank of the Theurgia and the leader of his official expedition from Pilaetium.” Upon closer inspection, Kincaid noticed an extra thin braid of gold at the wrists of her robes. Kincaid sat quietly and waited for them to continue. None of the words made sense to him other than their names. Pilaetium was the Empire of a Thousand Spears' capital city, but the rest didn’t register to his former life as a journeyman carpenter. If they were trying to impress Kincaid with their titles, he would disappoint them. He waited them out. “Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the use of magic in the Empire of a Thousand Spears?” the woman, Tereza, asked. “I am.” “Ah, then we should start even farther back.” “The beginning would be fine.” Kincaid was short with his words, but the school lecture was too loud. If the barkeep or workers heard this conversation about magic, the town guard would hang them by morning. Or worse, they’d send him back to Caesea for punishment at the hands of Atros. “There are two schools for magic within Pilaetium. We were students at Theurgia and passed our tests there. We’ve stayed on with the school as full hecaerae, the wizards of the capital. Other schools exist throughout the Empire as gifted people find their place with their power. Still, none compare to the schools of the capital.” Tereza finished her lecture and waited for questions. “I’m sure.” Sounds likes the sorceratti. “You should understand we are here looking for wizards within Caesea.” The young woman leaned forward in her seat and locked her gaze with Kincaid. “Not just any wizards. Ones already proven with their abilities.” The man held a smirk on his face as if they were offering knighthood to the uninitiated. Maybe even the unworthy. “You must be powerful…” Kincaid fumbled with their word and then skipped ahead, “mages.” “No, we are only of the first and second rank. The leaders of the Theurgists are fifth rank. Their control of arcane power is far beyond our simple level.” Questions raced through Kincaid’s head. How could they practice their power without destroying their lives? They weren’t old enough and didn’t bear the scars of their magic he'd seen in Caesea. Kincaid’s confusion slipped into his wrinkled brow. Did Magi Cormac, once the instructor of magic for the entire city of Caesea, learn his magical secrets from the schools of the Empire? “We can answer so many more questions, Kincaid.” The man’s voice was insistent. “You can start by explaining how you know my name.” “How many wizards beyond the sorceratti are there in Caesea? Or perhaps I should ask, how many living wizards are there?” he said. “Fair question. Sounds like you’ve spent some time trying to find me.” “We have. But consider our words. You don’t have to live… here.” The woman gestured around the room and wrinkled her nose. “Enjoy your meal.” The male wizard summoned the workers to the lopsided table and pointed toward the empty spaces. They got up and left a silver piece on the bar top. Kincaid considered walking away from the food as the guards cleared the entrance and escorted the hecaerae out. But his stomach overrode his brain and made him think through this decision. He might as well eat while he had the chance.",

      "content": "Kincaid - Visitors His soul labored with the scars of his magic. A deep, dreamless sleep didn’t drive away the fatigue. Not this fatigue. His body groaned from a night on the drafty room’s frigid floor, and the pain was deeper than his muscles and his bones. This is what it feels like to be old. The thought of aging before his time from his power wracked his mind with awful memories. The image of Vedette Atros, the youngest child of the powerful House of Atros, clinging to life in her ancient body lying in the street seared into his mind’s eye. He turned away from those terrible images. They wouldn’t be his future. Sholeh’s bed was tidy, neat, and empty. Although his sleep was restless, he couldn’t recall her dressing to leave before dawn. Kincaid shook his head and hoped she wasn’t laboring at another day job. They needed time to plan to spend his small winnings and get out of here. But first, breakfast. His stomach reminded him they survived on one meal a day to stretch their last coins. He kicked his blankets to the corner of the room and tightened his belt. Drafts from the approaching winter raced through the common area and caused the fire to flicker and sputter. The floor creaked with his footsteps. Too few nails in lumber any carpenter would reject. At least the area was empty after the laborers responded to the morning bells. He ran a copper penny between his fingers as he gestured to the working staff. As he took his perch in the corner on an uneven stool that rocked with his weight, a blast of approaching winter air surged from the main door. Two men stepped through the opening and slammed the door shut behind them. Their eyes probed the inn’s main floor and glared into each shadow. Each wore thick padded armor painted with a checkerboard of red and white squares. Belted swords and daggers hung at each hip, and both carried a long spear. Rather than rest their spears and settle into seats, one turned to open the door again. The common room staff didn’t appear scared, only curious. Quite a show. In a moment, a man and a woman strode in from the street. Neither bore the hardened looks of warriors nor carried an array of weapons. They were more dangerous. These two had the haughty air of nobility. Disgust for the inn was visible across the room. Kincaid considered his options for escape. He had none. Any movement to the stairs back to his room would draw the attention of the alert guards, and slipping out the door was impossible as he’d have to approach the noble guests. He kept his head down and traced the grain of the wood on the table. The nobles stepped to the bar to summon the owner, and Kincaid couldn’t decipher the words out of the voices' low rumble. Guards moved deeper into the room and took notice of the single patron waiting for breakfast. The door opened a last time, and two more guards entered. Both wore the same coat of arms. Six to one. They couldn’t be looking for him. He wasn’t worth that much attention. Unless they were from Atros, but the guards from Atros wore red with golden lions. Kincaid fought to control his heart rate under the scrutiny. The intensity of the stares didn’t change; they viewed him as a threat. The exchanged words were low but insistent as the man and woman probed for information. None of the people at the bar turned toward Kincaid, but the flow of conversation demanded answers. Kincaid summoned a trickle of arcane energy, fighting back the rush that hungered to claim his soul. With the smallest stream of power, the young wizard pushed his senses out to the edges of the room. The stiff padded armor crunched from the weapons' weight on the belts, and the thick boots squeaked against the loose floorboards. The guards’ breathing were normal as they conducted their duties. They didn’t view Kincaid as a threat. He forced his hearing to the conversation with the barkeep, and the words stopped in mid-sentence. The man and woman spun toward Kincaid. Each summoned a channel of their strength and shoved the force of magic back toward him. Kincaid’s heart raced as he faced the wizards. Their power was deep and honed to precise levels. His flow of magic was crude compared to their touch of the arcane. And they could toss aside his childish efforts with their magic. Kincaid’s expanded senses collapsed around him. The woman and a man approached Kincaid. The halo of power surrounded their bodies as they waved off the guards. Pausing two steps away, they sized up Kincaid. He straightened his back, raised an eyebrow, and endured their gaze. Their clothes were less garish than the red and white checkered armor of the escorts, but their clothes were also unique. Each wore long robes from their necks to an inch above the floorboards. The fine silk material fell perfectly across their bodies and flowed as they walked. Even the ruling houses of Caesea had a limited supply of this imported material. Their garment's right sleeve was sky blue, and each had gold thread, less than an inch wide at their wrists, and the opposite sleeve carried the red and white checkered pattern of the guards. The middle of the clothing was forest green with a competing inch of gold at the bottom. Both wore crafted leather belts with only an eating knife and a pouch. They approached the table and stopped by the remaining chairs. “A moment of your time, wizard?” The man’s voice gave away his teenage years with a squeak at the end of the sentence. His body was older—the price of magic. Brown eyes probed into Kincaid’s soul. Kincaid gestured to the two chairs in front of him with an open palm. The young magi remained seated as they joined him at the uneven table. “Why use magic against us?” The woman was to the point and more guarded than her companion. “You should have known we would feel the push of power.” “We’d have to respond,” the man said. “I didn’t know you used magic.” The pair glanced at each other, and the stone mask of interrogation slipped from their faces. The chairs creaked and groaned as they shifted their weight. Kincaid was relieved the guards with their weapons and armor didn’t join them as they would crush the chairs. “You couldn’t tell by our rank?” The question was bait, but Kincaid didn’t have a choice. “I’ve never seen those uniforms before, and I don’t understand what you mean by rank. But your conversation at the bar worried me.” “Don’t the laws of this city punish magic with execution?” The woman’s voice was low but directive. “Yes, and they’ve tried. But the city is busier with other things than a poor immigrant.” “I see your point.” The man nodded in an annoying all-knowing fashion so typical of nobility. “We do not come from the city or represent any of the misguided noble houses. But I should ask first, are you sorceratti?” the woman asked. Kincaid snorted. “Absolutely not. Do I even look like a native Caesean?” “There have been indiscretions in the past. Not of the sorceratti, of course.” The man’s voice shifted into a lecturing tone. For a moment, Kincaid missed the words of Magi Cormac. Kincaid couldn’t figure out why people always needed to explain things to him. “I am Petre, first rank of the Theurgia, hecaerae.” “And I am Tereza, second rank of the Theurgia and the leader of his official expedition from Pilaetium.” Upon closer inspection, Kincaid noticed an extra thin braid of gold at the wrists of her robes. Kincaid sat quietly and waited for them to continue. None of the words made sense to him other than their names. Pilaetium was the Empire of a Thousand Spears' capital city, but the rest didn’t register to his former life as a journeyman carpenter. If they were trying to impress Kincaid with their titles, he would disappoint them. He waited them out. “Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the use of magic in the Empire of a Thousand Spears?” the woman, Tereza, asked. “I am.” “Ah, then we should start even farther back.” “The beginning would be fine.” Kincaid was short with his words, but the school lecture was too loud. If the barkeep or workers heard this conversation about magic, the town guard would hang them by morning. Or worse, they’d send him back to Caesea for punishment at the hands of Atros. “There are two schools for magic within Pilaetium. We were students at Theurgia and passed our tests there. We’ve stayed on with the school as full hecaerae, the wizards of the capital. Other schools exist throughout the Empire as gifted people find their place with their power. Still, none compare to the schools of the capital.” Tereza finished her lecture and waited for questions. “I’m sure.” Sounds likes the sorceratti. “You should understand we are here looking for wizards within Caesea.” The young woman leaned forward in her seat and locked her gaze with Kincaid. “Not just any wizards. Ones already proven with their abilities.” The man held a smirk on his face as if they were offering knighthood to the uninitiated. Maybe even the unworthy. “You must be powerful…” Kincaid fumbled with their word and then skipped ahead, “mages.” “No, we are only of the first and second rank. The leaders of the Theurgists are fifth rank. Their control of arcane power is far beyond our simple level.” Questions raced through Kincaid’s head. How could they practice their power without destroying their lives? They weren’t old enough and didn’t bear the scars of their magic he'd seen in Caesea. Kincaid’s confusion slipped into his wrinkled brow. Did Magi Cormac, once the instructor of magic for the entire city of Caesea, learn his magical secrets from the schools of the Empire? “We can answer so many more questions, Kincaid.” The man’s voice was insistent. “You can start by explaining how you know my name.” “How many wizards beyond the sorceratti are there in Caesea? Or perhaps I should ask, how many living wizards are there?” he said. “Fair question. Sounds like you’ve spent some time trying to find me.” “We have. But consider our words. You don’t have to live… here.” The woman gestured around the room and wrinkled her nose. “Enjoy your meal.” The male wizard summoned the workers to the lopsided table and pointed toward the empty spaces. They got up and left a silver piece on the bar top. Kincaid considered walking away from the food as the guards cleared the entrance and escorted the hecaerae out. But his stomach overrode his brain and made him think through this decision. He might as well eat while he had the chance.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Forge",
      "content": "Sholeh - Forge Sparks danced away from the forge into the morning air. Each left a trail of smoke and escaped with the unrelenting impact of hammer against anvil. Red iron fell back from the steel onslaught driven by powerful arms. Sholeh longed for her old hammers. Each had a balance for the arc of her swing. With those tools, her swings were instinctive and true. Now she needed to focus on height and power of each blow. Once, she created art. This hammer was a crude tool. It was good enough for the stack of nails she was creating. She laid down the latest batch against the measuring board. Lining each up against the two-inch mark, she checked the length. Grabbing a pair of shears, she made precise cuts and added them to her pile. “She’s not going to check.” The voice was right by her ear, and the warm breath with the stink of old meat brushed the back of her neck. “Work must still be done right. Even when no one is watching.” Sholeh turned toward the young man. He’d been checking her out all morning. “You should slow down with that hammer. Relax a little. Get to know the people. You might find there are a few that want to help you.” He winked. Sholeh checked the heft of her hammer. One quick blow and this fool would be done with his advance. “You are offering to help?” “Oh, definitely.” His eyes roamed up and down her arms and settled on her chest. “Then deliver another stack of wood for my fire. Stoke the fires as I get the next set of nails ready. Now, if you please.” “There’s a price for this service, apprentice.” His words came through gritted teeth. “Be careful. The price may be more than you want to pay.” Sholeh squared her shoulders at the inexperienced man. He was tall for his age, a good head taller than Sholeh. He had the lanky figure of a young man not grown into his body yet confident in his size and strength. Sholeh wasn’t impressed. “You won’t last the week.” He turned away from the confrontation. His offer for “help” was already forgotten. Sholeh shook her head. She hadn’t been here long enough to earn enemies, and this shop was nothing like her forge on Caesea. The master kept enough work on their anvils that none had the time during the day to bother each other. Especially not harass each other. Sholeh pumped her bellows and added heat to the iron that waited its turn to become the simplest of tools, the nail. She longed for the time to craft weapons from fine steel or even repair the work of others. She wondered if she would graduate from spikes to horseshoes. “Nice work.” The woman who offered her the job examined the growing piles. “Each pile is a quarter pound of two-inch nails. I will have the rest done before dark.” “You aren’t an apprentice.” Sholeh gazed at the glowing metal waiting for the remainder of her work. She sighed and stopped. “No, I was a journeyman in Caesea.” The woman nodded. “I figured as much when you tested each hammer before you started. You knew what you were looking for.” “I can help here. But a week without pay—” “Wish I could change that. But we don’t take commissions and only pay as we go. I can offer twenty-five percent on your product today.” For nails? That’d be less than coppers for a day’s job. But more than what an apprentice would make. If she had her tools, she’d be able to ask for more. With no better options, Sholeh agreed. The woman nodded and returned to her tasks in the heat while the young man pumped the bellows but eyed Sholeh. She’d have to resolve his advances soon. Work continued through the afternoon as the anvils stayed busy. Sholeh ignored the hunger chewing at her insides. But the customers weren’t coming in for goods yet, and that meant her day’s effort wouldn’t yield a single penny. A curtain covered the entrance to the forge. It kept the drafts down and most of the heat in for the winter months. Sunlight poured into the workspace as the curtain threw open. A silhouette highlighted by the afternoon sun was all Sholeh could make out. With the leather fabric drawing closed, Sholeh observed a young woman standing at the counter, and she was alone and looked out of place in the smithy. Workers and servants came and did the work of those who had power and money, and this one didn't look like a laborer. In the flickering light of the flames, Sholeh noticed the uniform she wore. The long garments of the Empire with the white and red checkered sleeve representing the ruling classes. She had a blood-red sleeve on her right arm with the faintest thread of gold. Her robes were a deep black and clearly a student, not the fine silk of one of the masters. If she wasn’t mistaken, a student of Damis. “What do you need?” The lead blacksmith took care of the customers. The woman’s eyes scanned the forge and stopped on each worker. She wasn’t here for crafted metal goods. “I am looking for someone,” the young woman said. “This is a smithy…” The word trailed off from the intensity of the glare. The woman in the wizard’s robes didn’t need a reminder of what the shop did. “How long have these workers been working here?” “If you aren’t here to buy, then you can leave. We’re too busy.” Sholeh grounded her hammer and watched the red glow of iron dull to cool gray. She straightened her loaner apron and looked the hecaerae in the eyes. “What are you seeking, Hecaerae of Damis?” “It appears I found it.” The woman had young eyes but an older body, and she carried herself with the confidence of the Empire. “I gave you a profit share. You don’t need to walk out on me.” The lead smith tried to change the discussion. Neither woman paid her heed. Sholeh nodded to her employer and took off the apron. “I will be back.” “Not sure we’ll take you back.” The woman muttered and turned to her work at the anvil. The wizard gestured to the door and pulled aside the curtain to the afternoon air. Salty water blew off the harbor and chilled the sweat on Sholeh’s body. They walked away from the hammering of the forge. “I’m searching for a blacksmith who worked with the wizard in Caesea.” “Why are you looking for him?” “Are you admitting that you are the blacksmith?” Sholeh set her face and thrust her emotions into the pit of her stomach. She wouldn’t let this hecaerae push her around. She wasn’t in Pilaetium. Sholeh remained silent. “The wizard gained attention in the heart of the Empire, and the schools of magic are interested in what this magician from the west can do.” “The schools see him as a threat?” “The schools haven’t made an assessment yet. That’s why we traveled this far.” The woman stepped in closer. “I might arrange a meeting with the wizard, but the city is dangerous. The law demands execution of people who use magic.” “I am aware of these laws, and I do not think they apply. I’m an official delegate of the Empire and a member of the school of Damis.” “You do not know what happened in Caesea. A duel of wizards destroyed an island and harmed hundreds. The flicker of magic within the lands the city still controls will be met with force.” “Then, we will be careful.” The young woman’s half smile was not comforting. The schools would do what they wanted and wouldn’t respect the lives they threatened. The powerful in Pilaetium never did. And Kincaid would pay the consequences, again. “No. Careful is not enough. I will not help you.” “Foolish choice when I am the one offering help. Who else is reaching out their hand? And not in a fist?” “I think the wizard will do fine without your help.” “You should reconsider this choice, blacksmith.” Sholeh turned away from the woman and went back to the curtain. Boot steps ground in the cobblestone as the hecaerae turned away from Sholeh and strode down the street. Two signs from the Empire in one day. Beyond coincidence. They needed more than a plan to get out of the city. They needed to leave. Reality crashed down on her wild thoughts. Sholeh pulled up short as the young blacksmith waited on the other side of the curtain. He looked down at her with his lecherous grin. “A new girlfriend in your life? I was hoping you’d pick me.” “You must have work to do.” “Oh, I’m planning on it.” Sholeh had enough. Between the priest and the hecaerae, this fool would not be the one to tear down the rest of her day. She drew back a fist and landed the punch above the belt. The young man wasn’t prepared for the assault and lurched over. Her left fist caught the side of his face, and he dropped to the ground like a sack of firewood. He was on his knees, one hand scrabbling at the dirt floor while his lungs fought for a breath. Sholeh stepped around him and relit the flames of her forge. She pumped the bellows to the temperature of her rage. The shop paused only for a moment, and then the sound of steel on steel began again.",

      "title": "Bartalan - A Choice",
      "content": "Bartalan - A Choice “State your business.” Bartalan adjusted his black robes. He clenched his teeth and plucked at the thin gold thread at his sleeves. First rank was an accomplishment from years of study and training. Most students started before they became teenagers and waited years to take their tests. Bartalan finished the course of academics in just over two years. He should be second rank already. He brought his eyes up from his uniform and assessed the five thick golden braids of a powerful hecaerae. Not just any hecaerae, but the head of the Damithians. The fifth order hecaerae and center of arcane power for Pilaetium. This hecaerae was a native of the Empire and started his academics by the age of eight. Every student knew his story. He passed the tests and took his place among the first ranks by thirteen. Everyone thought the school slowed his education because Pilaetium couldn’t accept a pre-teen wizard with arcane power at his whims. Now he was a wizened old man with glasses perched at the end of his nose. He kept his scalp shaved and his face clean to avoid the iconic image of the ancient mage with a flowing white beard. But his leathery skin, gnarled fingers, and gravelly voice gave away the toll on his body. His eyes held a different story. Those eyes could peer through deception and gaze into the heart of the soul. No student wanted the summons to this office for discipline. Those eyes and experience could cut through the best-crafted lie and discern the truth. None walked out getting the better of this hecaerae. “Your business?” The voice asked again with a tinge of boredom. For too many years, supplicants lost their crafted speeches on this spot. Even powerful wizards froze. “I wish to propose a change to our rules.” Sparing unnecessary conversation, the head of the Damithians gestured with his bent fingers to continue. “We’ve stood in the shadows of the city’s power for too long. We spar with Theurgia over the trivial rules for those with potential for magic. The church grapples with us over the morality and ethics of power, and even the Emperor wonders at how he can deepen control over the hecaerae.” “All true.” The wizened head bobbed. “We’ve waited too long. We should look at the edges of the Empire, maybe even beyond, to find new magicians. Restore the power of our line into this city. Take our place—” “And what do you think our place is?” The voice was firm. The act of the old mage was over. This was the leader of Damis. Eyes bored into the middle of Bartalan’s chest. He didn’t sense the master of the school summoning a thread of power. Bartalan plunged forward, “At the head of the table. At the head of the Empire.” “An overthrow?” “No, no. Nothing so bold as rebellion. The blood in the streets would boil from the battle with Theurgia alone. And the merchants would take the city, and then the Empire would not be worth ruling.” The old man nodded in understanding. But Bartalan couldn’t determine agreement. “What is your plan?” “A long view. A gentle touch on the balance of power in our favor. New blood in our ranks of wizards to explore the edges of magic. Not enough to threaten the order, but sufficient to make the fight worth the effort for us all. Imagine the powers we could discover.” “We could just as easily join forces with Theurgia and create the same result.” The words lashed the first order hecaerae like a thunderbolt—an alliance with Theurgia. “I don’t see how this would ever happen. What would they gain from second place in an Empire we controlled?” “They would stand with us, as equals.” The old mage probed. He’d considered this idea before. Bartalan couldn’t hide his emotions. His nose wrinkled like he smelled droppings from a cavalry unit. His head shook with the concept of teaming up with the other school to share power. “How could they be equals? They do not have the same interest in magic as we do.” “Pursuit of power is a dangerous game, Bartalan. The Theurgists offer a balance to the study of magic.” The wizard paused and let the words sink in. “The ends can’t always justify the means.” “I’m not proposing to abandon the games of power within the Empire. Perhaps I misspoke.” “I do not think you did.” “I wish to set fresh pieces on the board. Manage our position. Political and magical.” “Why would a first rank come to the heart of our order and propose these sweeping changes, Bartalan?” “Because we need to change. We’ve prospered under the rules of the Empire. There’s no doubt. Two schools of magic with vast wealth and influence over people. A power center unto ourselves and not tools in some bastard’s army.” “Change is good. It is the centerpiece of life. But for what end?” “There’s more in the magic. More that we can learn. We don’t understand the depths of this power. I’m afraid I won’t be able to find it within the confines of our rules. “Interesting. To change the rules so you may find out more about your magic?” Bartalan broke the gaze of the master. He looked around at the collection of wealth and knowledge in this room. For at least a decade, this man stood at the head of their power center. He’d managed two different emperors and worked on control of the young pup thrust into the center of power just two years ago. Many books in this room were written in his hand. Theories and proposals. But little practical knowledge. A few nights ago, magic spoke to Bartalan in ways he couldn’t explain. Theories were interesting, and they made for great test questions for aspiring students. But magic wasn’t a theoretical game. It was power. “Not my magic. All magic. There is more, and we should find it.” The wizened man adjusted his frail weight in the cushions of his chair. He propped his arms on the elaborately crafted desk. The thick gold stripes on his sleeves went halfway up his forearms. “Bartalan, I cannot approve these changes. I will not threaten the years of progress magic has made in the Empire. I don’t know who is whispering these thoughts into your head about these changes, but you should study the role this school has played in the Empire's history. Perhaps you missed that in your studies.” Bartalan checked the bubbling anger in the pit of his stomach. The old man couldn’t see the changing world around them. They could find a new place in the Empire. And perhaps even beyond. “By your leave.” The master nodded. Bartalan spun on his heel and burst out of the room. He’d show them a new level of study.",

      "content": "Bartalan - A Choice “State your business.” Bartalan adjusted his black robes. He clenched his teeth and plucked at the thin gold thread at his sleeves. First rank was an accomplishment from years of study and training. Most students started before they became teenagers and waited years to take their tests. Bartalan finished the course of academics in just over two years. He should be second rank already. He brought his eyes up from his uniform and assessed the five thick golden braids of a powerful hecaerae. Not just any hecaerae, but the head of the Damithians. The fifth order hecaerae and center of arcane power for Pilaetium. This hecaerae was a native of the Empire and started his academics by the age of eight. Every student knew his story. He passed the tests and took his place among the first ranks by thirteen. Everyone thought the school slowed his education because Pilaetium couldn’t accept a pre-teen wizard with arcane power at his whims. Now he was a wizened old man with glasses perched at the end of his nose. He kept his scalp shaved and his face clean to avoid the iconic image of the ancient mage with a flowing white beard. But his leathery skin, gnarled fingers, and gravelly voice gave away the toll on his body. His eyes held a different story. Those eyes could peer through deception and gaze into the heart of the soul. No student wanted the summons to this office for discipline. Those eyes and experience could cut through the best-crafted lie and discern the truth. None walked out getting the better of this hecaerae. “Your business?” The voice asked again with a tinge of boredom. For too many years, supplicants lost their crafted speeches on this spot. Even powerful wizards froze. “I wish to propose a change to our rules.” Sparing unnecessary conversation, the head of the Damithians gestured with his bent fingers to continue. “We’ve stood in the shadows of the city’s power for too long. We spar with Theurgia over the trivial rules for those with potential for magic. The church grapples with us over the morality and ethics of power, and even the Emperor wonders at how he can deepen control over the hecaerae.” “All true.” The wizened head bobbed. “We’ve waited too long. We should look at the edges of the Empire, maybe even beyond, to find new magicians. Restore the power of our line into this city. Take our place—” “And what do you think our place is?” The voice was firm. The act of the old mage was over. This was the leader of Damis. Eyes bored into the middle of Bartalan’s chest. He didn’t sense the master of the school summoning a thread of power. Bartalan plunged forward, “At the head of the table. At the head of the Empire.” “An overthrow?” “No, no. Nothing so bold as rebellion. The blood in the streets would boil from the battle with Theurgia alone. And the merchants would take the city, and then the Empire would not be worth ruling.” The old man nodded in understanding. But Bartalan couldn’t determine agreement. “What is your plan?” “A long view. A gentle touch on the balance of power in our favor. New blood in our ranks of wizards to explore the edges of magic. Not enough to threaten the order, but sufficient to make the fight worth the effort for us all. Imagine the powers we could discover.” “We could just as easily join forces with Theurgia and create the same result.” The words lashed the first order hecaerae like a thunderbolt—an alliance with Theurgia. “I don’t see how this would ever happen.

      "title": "Kincaid - Reminders of the Past",
      "content": "Kincaid - Reminders of the Past A fist thundered on Kincaid’s door. He wiped the sleep out of his eyes and threw his pants and shirt over his small clothes. Kincaid glanced back to the empty bed and their lack of belongings before he pulled open the door. “No more promises. Pay now, or you are out.” The evening meal’s preparation smeared the man’s dirty apron. His meaty right fist carried a club. Kincaid clenched his jaw until his mouth hurt. The man wasn’t extorting him; he wanted the money owed to him. But coming up to the room in the middle of the afternoon with a club was a bit much. He didn’t think they were that far behind. “I’ve got some money now. It should be enough.” “Pay what you owe, or you’ll be looking for a comfortable rock for a pillow in the streets.” They weren’t living in the lap of luxury, and he was sure this man couldn’t find a pillow in a lineup of furniture and linens. But Kincaid had to do something. He couldn’t tell Sholeh that he’d failed again. Not today. He reached for his bag of earnings, and the jingle of coins changed the man’s expression. The fist relaxed, and the club pointed toward the ground. A true man of business. “What do we owe you?” “All of that.” “That’s outrageous.” “You owe for the room, the food, and the late fee.” “You’re robbing us.” Kincaid kept the smolder out of his voice as he looked at the man stealing the last vestiges of his escape plan. “You’ve been taking from us. Staying in our rooms, eating our food, avoiding me when the rent is due. Consider this my last offer to you. I could always send you off to the watch. Let you spend some time in debtor’s prison. Pay up.” Kincaid didn’t have options. A confrontation with the local law would lead him back into the arms of Caesea. He would not go back to jail again. Even if it cost him his soul. He handed over the bag of wealth. Kincaid felt his dreams disappear as the weight left his hands. The owner’s head bobbed as he fingered through the contents. “Enough there to cover my ‘late fee’?” “Yes, yes.” The counting went on, and the man looked back at Kincaid. “Enough for two more days here.” Kincaid’s mouth dropped. “There’s enough in there for a month. With food.” “Not when you are weeks behind. Find some real work. Stop getting beat up at night and find a place for your wife.” The man’s tone was softer. Almost as if he felt bad for the young wizard. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that.” “Try harder.” The man turned away and tucked the bag under his apron. Kincaid closed the door and shifted to the dump they called a room. He couldn’t get ahead in the lands of Caesea. Everyone established their position of power over others. Even an innkeeper pushed to control the life of at least one person. Kincaid reached under the pile of linens and grabbed his second pouch of coins. Coming home with a black eye and the confrontation this morning was enough warning that the owner would look for his due. The young wizard divided his earnings into two piles and hid a quarter of the wealth. They’d get through a few more weeks, but they would never get ahead. Kincaid stepped outside the inn and gazed toward the horizon of the setting afternoon sun. He longed for the easier days when he had a trunk packed with warm clothes, and he missed the room stocked with furniture he’d crafted with his hands in his spare time. His dirty sleeve wiped across his eyes before they left trails of water on his cheeks. He worried about Sholeh. They already sold off their most valuable possessions, and the day jobs they struggled to keep weren’t enough to let them live. Never mind escape. Sholeh took all of this personally. She’d tried to save him. Kincaid knew his solution couldn’t be magic. The small redhead couldn’t appear in more fights without getting thrown out the door. Options were few. But he couldn’t let them starve. His feet took him toward the docks. People scurried under the weight of loads to and from ships. Shouts echoed across the piers and sounded like gulls in the distance. Kincaid had to commit himself to the backbreaking work. Maybe a ship captain would take notice of his work and offer a job. Kincaid dodged to the side of the street and paused at a storefront. Red cloaks with the golden lion of Atros paced among the dockworkers. Four soldiers methodically questioned the masses. How hard would it be to find a red-haired immigrant in this port town? Not time to take those chances. A nearby bar provided cover with crowds gathered under the overhang near the door. Onlookers pointed and murmured. Another group approached the dock with armed guards pushing through the crowds. Flashing amidst the everyday workers’ dark clothes were the bright red and white checkered arms of the Empire's soldiers. This group had the pair of wizards from the inn in trail. The crowd parted as the two groups faced off. No slither of drawn steel; no sense of summoned magic. Kincaid admitted they’d need to pull a torrent of magic for him to sense the surge at this distance without touching the arcane plane himself. Kincaid decided against a nudge of wizardry. No reason to draw attention to himself. Yet. Hands gestured as the groups talked, but none moved toward weapons. The two wizards knew where Kincaid and Sholeh were staying. If those hecaerae and Atros joined forces... He’d feel better if he knew what they were saying. Interest in the conversation faded. Onlookers had work to do, and without a fight, none would stay interested in the discussion. The main street was busy with day laborers making their way to the docks. Captains finished the preparation for a morning departure and still needed manual labor to get things done. Throwing caution aside, Kincaid joined the end of the group and considered his plight. He’d find out what the groups were discussing, but he’d be in line for a day of heavy work under the scrutiny of a master stevedore. There had to be more to his life than running away from powerful factions and tedious labor. His group queued up at the ropes by the dock. The Porters’ Guild ran the entry to the piers and filtered the men and women who could do the labor and those who wanted charity. No place for loafers with the unending pace of the tide. A Porters’ Guild guard stood with crossed arms and a deep scowl. His shaved head revealed a puckered scar from his left eyebrow to the back of his skull. Life on the docks wasn’t easy. With one finger, he gestured people forward or indicated they should get out of line. First officers sized up the ones moving forward and got them to work. The Guild would get their dues at the end of the day. Kincaid’s plan was already coming apart. He couldn’t hear the discussion between the groups at this distance, and he’d be revealed to the Atros guards once he got to the front of the line. He needed the coin from the day’s work, and he longed to pick up the exchange. This wasn’t working. The line shuffled forward, and the foreman scrutinized each hopeful worker. He grunted acceptance and scowled rejection. At least the guards weren’t paying attention to the prospective workers. One of the hopeful men received a deep scowl, and the rejected man limped back to the line of bars. The former carpenter left the line and walked away from his failed effort to learn more about the conversation. He couldn't take the chance. At least shouts didn’t follow Kincaid’s departure. The normal shanties serving liquor and pleasures to the transient sailors lined the docks. None made enough money to invest in infrastructure, and Kincaid’s training as a carpenter recoiled from the shoddy work. The next major storm would send the wood into the sea. Kincaid huddled under the overhang of the nearest structure and mixed in with others from the rejected workforce. He let the powers of magic trickle into his soul and reached out with his heightened senses. A terrible gamble. But he needed the information from this encounter. Neither he nor Sholeh could afford to be oblivious to this possible union of interests. “Magic is against the law in the lands of Caesea.” The leader of the guards wasn’t confrontational, just factual. “We are emissaries from the Empire of a Thousand Spears, and we are familiar with your laws,” the male wizard, Petre, spoke. He tucked his hands into the cuffs of his sleeves. The gold trim flashed in the rays of the sun. “Using magic within your lands is the farthest thing on our minds. Neither of us would dare to challenge the standing laws of Caesea. We can use magic, but we won’t.” The female wizard, Tereza, kept the same measured tone as her male partner. Kincaid breathed a sigh under his breath. They were true to their word, and they wouldn’t detect the trickle of power he was using, especially at this distance. He refocused his efforts. “We will have to report your presence here. The City Council will want to know of your arrival and will expect you to present your credentials.” “We won’t be staying long. We are simply passing through your lands.” Petre paused for a moment and looked over the rank and insignia of the head guard of the Atros contingent. “I don’t recognize your symbols. Different than the city.” “We belong to the House of Atros.” “I see. And I’ve heard the House of Atros passed the responsibilities of leadership to a new house. A Duchess.” Tereza’s words weren’t an accusation, just a report of hard facts. The lead guard took the statement like a physical blow. The bodyguards from the Empire tensed in response but made no move. The slight to their honor could escalate to an insult. No one needed bloodshed on the docks. “Your information is accurate. Why are you here, if not to visit the City Council?” The guard’s formality seemed out of place in the docks of the city. Kincaid wondered how the upper ranks of society enjoyed speaking to each other in stilted phrases. “We were looking for a wizard.” The woman dropped the phrase like a cannonball in their midst. “As are we.” “Then the rumors must be true about the battle on your islands. People here on the shore still speak of the strange lightning and explosive thunder from the main city.” Tereza’s voice was laden with subtle accusation. “The wizard escaped, and we continue the search. We will bring him to justice. Perhaps we could join forces in this search?” “Unlikely.” Petre dismissed the proposal with a wave of his hand. “Our goals are not the same.” “Then we would ask for your information, as a favor to the House of Atros.” “You can’t offer us anything that we want. We wish you the best of luck with your search. We’ll be gone in the morning, so the City Council will not have to worry about a pair of wizards in your lands.” Petre’s tone was dismissive to the guards from Atros. “If you excuse us, we need to make our way to our ship.” The party from the Empire slipped past the impromptu barricades left up by the Porter’s Guild. People leaped to prepare a skiff to take the pair out to their waiting ship. They’d seen enough of this backwater port. The guards from Atros scanned the workers still waiting to pass muster and the scrutiny of the Porters’ Guild. The line of remaining workers was short enough that the guards from Atros would take their search off the docks and push inland. Bars would be the first stop. He also didn’t want them noticing his shock of red hair moving back up the mainland streets. Instead, Kincaid slipped inside the door and found himself awash in the stench of humanity. Hard labor and meager wages found company in the cheapest places. Filthy glasses, wooden mugs, and dirty bowls made their rounds. The rumble of low conversations filled the bar. The tone would be different at night, and Kincaid wouldn’t want to be here at nightfall. He slipped his compact frame through the crowd and made his way toward the back door of the bar. Places like this didn’t have just one entrance or exit. They’d want people to get in and out easily, and some of these patrons needed discretion. The guards would continue their search through the town. Kincaid tried to guess how much time he had left before someone tipped off Atros, or they accidentally came across him.",

A Duchess.” Tereza’s words weren’t an accusation, just a report of hard facts. The lead guard took the statement like a physical blow. The bodyguards from the Empire tensed in response but made no move. The slight to their honor could escalate to an insult. No one needed bloodshed on the docks. “Your information is accurate. Why are you here, if not to visit the City Council?” The guard’s formality seemed out of place in the docks of the city. Kincaid wondered how the upper ranks of society enjoyed speaking to each other in stilted phrases. “We were looking for a wizard.” The woman dropped the phrase like a cannonball in their midst. “As are we.” “Then the rumors must be true about the battle on your islands. People here on the shore still speak of the strange lightning and explosive thunder from the main city.” Tereza’s voice was laden with subtle accusation. “The wizard escaped, and we continue the search. We will bring him to justice. Perhaps we could join forces in this search?” “Unlikely.” Petre dismissed the proposal with a wave of his hand. “Our goals are not the same.” “Then we would ask for your information, as a favor to the House of Atros.” “You can’t offer us anything that we want. We wish you the best of luck with your search. We’ll be gone in the morning, so the City Council will not have to worry about a pair of wizards in your lands.” Petre’s tone was dismissive to the guards from Atros. “If you excuse us, we need to make our way to our ship.” The party from the Empire slipped past the impromptu barricades left up by the Porter’s Guild. People leaped to prepare a skiff to take the pair out to their waiting ship. They’d seen enough of this backwater port. The guards from Atros scanned the workers still waiting to pass muster and the scrutiny of the Porters’ Guild. The line of remaining workers was short enough that the guards from Atros would take their search off the docks and push inland. Bars would be the first stop. He also didn’t want them noticing his shock of red hair moving back up the mainland streets. Instead, Kincaid slipped inside the door and found himself awash in the stench of humanity. Hard labor and meager wages found company in the cheapest places. Filthy glasses, wooden mugs, and dirty bowls made their rounds. The rumble of low conversations filled the bar. The tone would be different at night, and Kincaid wouldn’t want to be here at nightfall. He slipped his compact frame through the crowd and made his way toward the back door of the bar. Places like this didn’t have just one entrance or exit. They’d want people to get in and out easily, and some of these patrons needed discretion. The guards would continue their search through the town. Kincaid tried to guess how much time he had left before someone tipped off Atros, or they accidentally came across him.",

      "content": "Kincaid - Escape without a Plan “You won’t believe—” “What happened to me today…” Sholeh cocked her head to one side, and Kincaid stopped his sentence with a broad grin on his face. Perhaps a hot meal was enough to raise their spirits. The young magi wished it was because their fortune had turned. Sholeh and Kincaid sat in the corner of their dingy inn, sharing a simple supper of watery stew and day-old bread. The innkeeper had been good to his word, and the agreement paid for the meager meal. “You first,” Kincaid gestured with his wooden spoon and then attacked his bowl of stew. Worse than he imagined, but they couldn’t afford the luxury of spices or salt. “I went out to look for work, and I ran into someone I knew from the Empire.” The spoon paused in the air before Kincaid’s mouth. He put the food back into the bowl and looked into her eyes. “Someone randomly remembered you? After four years away from the Empire?” Sholeh crossed her hands behind her bowl. “Yes. Not just anyone. The priest of the church here remembered me from when I was younger. He was an apprentice.” “What are the odds of that?” “About the same as finding out my friend is a powerful magi.” “Good point. What will he do?” “That makes me afraid, Kincaid. If he sends word back to the Empire that I am here, people will come looking.” “I thought you were just another immigrant searching for skilled work.” “I am, but the rest of the story is for another time.” Kincaid wrestled with the revelation. In the past, Kincaid and Sholeh had been very close. Their relationship took on a new intensity when Kincaid’s imprisonment and assumption of arcane power thrust them into the crucible of change. They’d became close again, fought the noble houses, dared to raid prisons, and faced every challenge side by side. And yet, there was so much more the young man didn’t know. He couldn’t read her face now, and that bothered him. “We are out of time anyway, Sholeh. I was scrounging for work and headed down to the docks. A group of guards from Atros is looking for me. They’ll find us.” Kincaid attacked the meal before it got cold. “By all that is holy, we don’t have enough to get away from this place yet.” “We can always walk away from here and try another town.” “But we will be in the same situation. Hiding and delaying for money we are unable to raise. We will not be closer to any goal.” “It’s worse, though, Sholeh.” He reached across the table to hold her hands. She reached back to him, and Kincaid brushed the raw spots and roughed callouses in her palms. She’d worked hard today. “There were two wizards from the Empire—” “Two?” “Yeah, a man and a woman. Why?” Sholeh shook her head. “What were they wearing?” “Robes. Expensive ones. Why?” Sholeh shook her head and held up her hand to hold back the questions. “What did the robes look like?” “Red and white checkered on the sleeve.” “That is the official symbol of the Empire. What about the other sleeve?” “Blue. Kind of light, like the sky. The rest of the robes looked green. Awfully bright for travel around Caesea.” “By all that is holy, Theurgia.” “What’s Theurgia?” “One school of magic in the capital. Kincaid, a wizard from Damis approached me.” “I don’t know what that is either.” “The competing school of magic in the capital.” “We were both approached by the schools of magic from the Empire?” “Not the only schools. The most significant ones.” Kincaid lost his appetite. His beer remained untouched as he looked around the room. If anyone were taking unusual notice of them, he’d be ready to leave tonight. Kincaid always expected the pressure would tighten on them, but he assumed they’d have enough time to slip out. Instead, they were in the middle as the jaws of a trap slammed closed. “What did this wizard from…” “Damis. We call them Damithians.” “Ok, Damis. What did this wizard from Damis want with you?” “She was looking for a blacksmith known to accompany a wizard from Caesea.” “How could a word travel to the Empire so fast?” “The timing would be about right for a fast ship to reach Pilaetium, make a decision among the institutions, and send investigators forward.” “The wizards confronted me here in the inn.” “They were talking to you?” Sholeh’s meal was still untouched. “Yes, you didn’t let me finish. I felt like I was going through an interview with them. To see if I was worthy enough to enter their school.” “You would be the first to do so, if true.” “I don’t understand.” “I will explain more later. We need to be moving away from here soon, my friend.” “A priest who remembers you, an angry house closing in on our trail, and two schools of wizards figuring out what I can do. I’m sure we don’t want to stay here. At least the wizards from Theurgia wouldn’t cooperate with Atros. I listened to that discussion on the docks.” “Their interests do not align. Theurgia wants to know more about wizards in the areas of the west. Atros wants to kill us both.” “Thankful for little things, I guess. Tell me about your wizard.” “My wizard was a woman. I did not think she was old enough to pass the tests looked for the blacksmith with the wizard. From what you have told me, both schools of magic are now looking for you.” “I need this school, Sholeh. But what do I do about both schools looking for me?” Sholeh sat and chewed the inside of her cheek, and Kincaid secretly wished his ability involved reading minds. Life would be so much easier. “I do not have a good answer. But I’m concerned about deciding without understanding what is going on in the Empire.” “They’ll use me?” The corners of Sholeh’s eyes were wet as she nodded. “Then we make our way and figure this out. Together.” Sholeh reached forward and gripped Kincaid’s hands as she blinked away the tears before they became streams down her cheeks. “I wish I understood why in one day we ended up with so much attention.” “I can only imagine it was the tide. Change is coming, my friend. We need to be ready.” The spoons resumed scooping their dinner. They couldn’t afford to waste the money, and they’d need strength for the days ahead. The couple suffered the rest of their meal in silence.",

      "title": "Kincaid - An Offer",
      "content": "Kincaid - An Offer Their meal continued with tense silence. With each scoop of their basic fare and sip of watery beer, Kincaid and Sholeh watched the patrons and the shadows. The people in the common room were locals who usually spent their meager wealth on the same low-standard food. Sailors and travelers preferred more robust fare and cleaner abodes. Sholeh played with her spoon in the bowl. Only a few breadcrumbs remained from their dinner, and the warmth of a full belly was worth the stinging bruises on his face. She didn’t glance up into his eyes, and the scraping sound of the wooden spoon reminded him of the end of their options. Sholeh counted on him. Their situation forced him to try harder. He’d have to make enough money quickly to get them on their way to something else. If people were looking for Sholeh, she couldn’t go back to the smithy. If Atros ran into the other wizard, they’d zero in on their location. A few patrons made their approach into the bar to grab some food. Men and women needed cheap options with the few coins they might have left in their possession. Another day could bring a small bag of cash to the barkeep. The cycle would continue as people lived paycheck to paycheck. Kincaid couldn’t break out of that cycle. Someone new entered the bar and approached the owner to trade some words. The barkeep nodded and pointed toward Kincaid and Sholeh as the woman turned to glance in their direction. She flung a coin to the barkeep and strode across the distance as jet black hair tied back into a ponytail bounced with each step. Blue eyes cut through the haze of the poorly vented fireplace and locked onto the couple. Kincaid reached across the table and gripped Sholeh’s forearm. He glanced toward the advancing woman, and Sholeh followed his gaze. The woman carried a long blade at her left hip with an elaborate bell grip surrounding the pommel. A heavy dirk with a wide crossguard hung at her right hip. The scuffed belt, worn weapons, and confident walk reminded Kincaid of the blademasters of Caesea. At least she wasn’t wearing the golden lion of Atros. Her loose shirt tucked into her belt was deep red, almost the color of dried blood. But the cut was perfect for allowing her to move without restraint. Her leather pants inserted into well-traveled, knee-high boots. Kincaid wondered if she spent time at sea as a pirate. “Mind if I pull up a seat?” The accent was distinct from the locals of Caesea. From the Northern States. Kincaid gestured with his left hand toward the empty seat in an invitation. As the woman slid into the chair next to him, Kincaid hoped she couldn’t draw that blade while sitting. Even the dirk would be difficult to wield. Kincaid’s heart pounded, but he relaxed the tension in his shoulders. “How’s the beer in this place?” “This must be your first time in this inn.” Kincaid’s voice was more confident than he felt. The warrior snorted as she looked around the room of the inn. “Well, I wouldn’t come here for the food, the beer, or the décor. Must be the company.” Her eyes swung back to the couple. “The beer is terrible, the foodstuff is worse, and we wish to know why you are here.” Sholeh wasn’t impressed with the recent arrival and let it show. “Then let me buy you a round of something better.” The woman slid back out from behind the table and walked back to the bar. She leaned forward and spoke in a low tone to the barkeep. “Another coincidence, Kincaid?” Sholeh kept her voice above a whisper, but the insistence split the distance between them. “She’s not trying to kill us.” “We do not know that yet. What if she is after a bounty on you?” “Her blade won’t stop me.” Kincaid stopped the discussion as the woman turned back to the pair and nodded. She made her way across the room and sat down. “I get it. You’re wondering why I am sitting down with you.” Sholeh and Kincaid answered with silence. “Look, I don’t care about your background. The barkeep said you’re out of money, and I’m short two swords for my company. My caravan leaves in a day, and I’m out of options.” She leaned back and crossed her arms across her chest. “I am a smith, trained in Caesea.” The woman raised her eyebrow. “We can use a smith. Keeping gear ready on the road will be good. We might get the other companies to throw some money into the pot.” “You?” “Carpenter, also trained in Caesea.” “We can do the same thing with the woodwork on the caravan. Might be a chance to earn a few more coins for the company. But I need swords. I’m not getting paid to bring logistics to the expedition. Ever a hold a sword?” “Hammers.” “That might work.” “Yes, I’ve trained with swords.” Sholeh shot Kincaid a look of disgust. “But we’ve sold everything we have to make payments for our lives. Not much left but what we have on our backs.” “That could come out of your payment. I provide weapons, you use your skills as a blacksmith and carpenter, and you sign up with my company to travel. Gear comes out of your fee. Food as well.” Kincaid and Sholeh traded glances. With the threats closing in, this could be their ticket out of the reach of Caesea. Even better, it could get them to the Empire without committing to either school of wizards. There had to be a catch. “What is your name?” Kincaid asked. “Adelaise the Red.” She gave a shallow bow from her waist while seated at the table. “Captain in the Guild of Blades.” “You are young to be a captain, Adelaise the Red.” Sholeh still wasn’t convinced. “Some of us have capabilities beyond our years. Wouldn’t you agree?” Her eyes didn’t leave Sholeh. Kincaid and Sholeh traded glances. They reached a silent agreement through the desperate nature of their situation. “Agreed.” Kincaid extended a hand. “When do we leave?” Adelaise gripped his forearm. “Day after tomorrow. East road by the church. The wagons form up before dawn, but you will report to me. Don’t let the other companies push you around. And don’t be bantering with the merchants; they’ll throw you out of the convoy in a heartbeat.” “Understood.” “And stay out of trouble here. You’re not registered with the guild, and you won’t have any protection.” Kincaid wondered what trouble they might find.",

Adelaise kept her company paid on time and her people fed, and this was an expense she didn’t need before the caravan left. “Right where you said I’d find them.” “I don’t need your money.” The woman wrinkled her nose as if she smelled sour milk. “But you said—” “You owe me. A favor. In the future.” A deal with a wizard was never an agreeable thing. Even worse when they were acting on behalf of one of the schools. The Blade Guild wouldn’t be able to protect her if she got crosswise with this hecaerae. “What do you want with the girl?” “Nothing. It’s the boy.” Adelaise relaxed in one of the finer inns in this town. The Rose and Anchor served fine wine and hearty food. The seats had cushions, and none of the furniture felt like it would collapse. The fare would be better in the Empire's capital, but for a port town, this was satisfying. Merchants from the caravan already left for their rooms, and the remaining wealthy patrons nursed the end of their wine bottles. Two women wouldn’t attract attention in this bar, and the owner prided herself on discretion. Business deals and agreements happened in the main room. Private discussions could happen out of the sight of the law and other patrons. Adelaise didn’t need this level of discretion with her informant. “Why are the Damithians interested in the boy?” “Do you always ask these questions? I would think sellswords were fine with payment and a direction to point their weapons.” “I’m the one doing the paying right now. As the customer, I’d like to know more.” She tried to keep the sarcasm out of her voice, but it was too late. “The boy means nothing to me, but he’s close to the girl.” “I think our business here is complete. You asked for help to find the smith, and you found her. You owe me a favor, sellsword.” The woman got up and brushed off her robes. “Thank you for the wine.” Adelaise leaned back in her chair as the wizard departed. She didn’t like how this contract was evolving. Running a company for merchants to get their goods to the Empire before snow closed the passes was tough enough. But she came to the lands of Caesea on a different contract. The work just got more challenging with more interested parties. She could pull it off. Adelaise poured another glass of the red wine. Dry with subtle fruit flavors. The bottle was from a local vineyard. She'd have to remember this one for her next trip to Caesea. The thump of boots on the wooden floor approached from across the room. Weapons and armor jingled with each stride—another mercenary. So much for the discretion. Adelaise closed her eyes and shook her head. “What about my offer, Adelaise?” “Xenres, I just don’t see it happening.” Her fellow mercenary captain kept his thumbs tucked into the thick leather of his weapon belt. Sword and dagger hung in their scabbards. At least he didn’t make a move to sit. “You might change your mind. Getting involved with the damned wizards never helps our contracts.” A scowl deepened between his thick black brows, and his lips formed a tight line. “I’ve got a contract to run, and I have a company to prepare. And you should be following the rules about your contract.” “I don’t want any complications with the people you associate yourself with.” “You won’t buy me out.” “That’s not all—” “Shut up.” Adelaise’s relaxed pose had a steel core, and Xenres noticed the change in her posture. He pulled back a half step, and his left hand fingered the pommel of his blade. “Think about what you are doing, Adelaise.” “I’m not the one touching the sword.” Xenres took another step away from Adelaise and dropped his hands by his side. “Our companies will be on the road for a while.” He snarled the last words. Adelaise was up out of her chair in a blink. Her weight was forward on the balls of her feet. She’d practiced her draw so many times; she calculated she could end the fight before the buffoon cleared the blade from his sheath. She hoped his pig head knew that. “If you are going to threaten me, you should’ve brought a few friends.” “Not a threat, Adelaise.” The mercenary captain looked around the room with the commotion he caused. Looks like he would choose discretion. “But you should be staying away from those damn wizards. No good will come of it for any of us. And if the guild finds out…” There was the threat. “Even if they investigate, they’ll find nothing. I've filled my roster for our departure, just like you.” The man couldn’t come up with a farewell or snide comment. He turned and walked away. Adelaise looked toward the brown bottle with the local wicker weave around the base. Empty. That’s too bad. It would have made a better companion than the talk tonight.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Out of Options",
      "content": "Kincaid - Out of Options Kincaid’s breath came out in puffs of white vapor. He stamped his feet and rubbed his hands together as he waited for the morning sun to peek over the hills. They never had enough money for warm clothes. The crunch on the gravel grew louder as supplies and goods made their way into the wagons. Ropes creaked with secured loads, and springs groaned from the weight pushing against the axels—a fortune in goods from the craft masters of Caesea. Kincaid had no doubt the caravan would make an incredible profit, if they made it to the Empire. Which also meant security would be tight. Travelers would gravitate toward the convoy’s safety, and any of them could be lookouts for unsavory forces. The movement of wealth overland always attracted attention. If word leaked out to bandits, then the hired swords would fight. Kincaid wasn't a good swordsman. Sholeh positioned the entire caravan between her and the squat structure of the church. The encounter with the priest must have rattled her. She’d been silent about the cleric and what that might mean, but they had plenty of time ahead with the caravan duty. One company of mercenaries patrolled the growing line of merchandise and material. Kincaid peered into the pre-dawn gloom to see if the rest of Adelaise’s company assembled for muster. No sign of the red-shirted warrior. Without the captain to vouch for them, they’d be stuck in the coastal town “What do you think?” Kincaid slid up to his friend for warmth. Sholeh shivered in the morning air. Her eyes flicked to the church. “We can blend into this caravan. Take our cover as guards. It could work, my friend.” “But we know nothing about being guards. I’m a terrible swordsman, and you know it.” “We have a captain to back us up, Kincaid. We will be fine.” “Where is Adelaise?” Kincaid left the statement in the air. Frustrating. Five guards rubbing their arms to fight back the cold took notice of the couple. Without cover from their employer, the time to leave was past. They’d have to meet up with the company later. Kincaid slipped his hand into Sholeh’s and swung away from the caravan. They walked toward the docks and then curved down a side street close to their inn. When they were comfortably out of earshot of the guards, Kincaid brought up his concern. “Travelling with the group solves one problem, but what about the weather between the Empire and us? We’re leaving before the passes close with snow, right?” “Yes. We will see snow and some wind. Snow will already cover the mountains at the peaks.” “We’re not dressed for that, Sholeh. I’m pretty sure the merchants will not open their crates and give us a fur cloak. And I don’t think we will go to our captain and explain that we might freeze to death before we reach the Empire.” “What do we have left?” Kincaid fumbled with the purse at his belt. The weight was lighter than he hoped, and it was all they had left between them. He tossed her the bag. “We are paid at the inn for another day. We will eat tonight.” And then we return to starving again, Kincaid thought. The deal with the captain better hold. They couldn’t afford to pay their way. “Think we have enough to buy another set of warm clothes today?” “Let us find out.” Sholeh tucked their money into her belt and gave Kincaid a tight-lipped smile. The city streets were awake with the morning rush of day workers and shop owners plying their trades. Sholeh did not let go of Kincaid’s hand as they made their way to the cluster of tailor shops. As they turned the corner to Tailor Street, the jingle of armor and weapons rose above the normal morning noises of shops opening. A pair of guards entered Tailor Street from a side street. They wore the colors of Caesea and probably were customs agents. Probably. Kincaid squeezed Sholeh’s hand tight enough to make her grimace, and they stopped at the store on the corner. At least it was one of the coopers, and with the harbor and the departing caravans, the shop was busy. They found their way among the other patrons. “Atros is here too.” Sholeh heard his voice under his breath and responded with a squeeze. The red tabards with golden lions were too much for Kincaid to miss, and the guards were moving toward customers in the cooper’s shop. The pair made their way back toward the main road. Thankfully, no shouts followed them. Their only option was to head back to the wagons and blend in with the collection of foreigners there. Their pace was slow and meaningful, not a couple dodging suspicion. Once away from the intersection of the guards, Sholeh broke the silence between them. “By all that is holy, they are still looking for us?” “Yes. Atros is still searching, and they are closer. We can’t afford to stay here much longer.” They pulled up short on the main road. Kincaid pulled Sholeh off to the side. Another pair of guards from Atros was at the caravan's tail end, talking to the mercenary guards. No good options in this direction either. “Back to the room?” “They are searching this area now. How much time do we have left before they look through the inn? Or even ask the right question? The barkeep already sold us out once.” “We need to get outside of their search area.” Kincaid kept the warmth of Sholeh’s hand in his own. They stayed in motion, moving through the streets and staying near the crowds. As the morning turned toward lunch, the couple walked back toward Tailor’s Street. The crowds were gone, and so were the searching guards. They invested the last few pieces of their coins for warmer clothes. The caravan was their only option.",

      "content": "Kincaid - Caravan Neither slept. Creaks set Kincaid and Sholeh on edge, and voices filtered through the floors startled them. Kincaid held his breath, waiting for guards from Atros to burst through their ramshackle door. By first light, Kincaid and Sholeh wolfed down the watery mess the inn had to start the day. Their packs with their few remaining belongings waited at their feet. One waterproof bag held all their wealth in the world. It was a pittance as they prepared to escort the loaded wealth to the Empire. The cloaks purchased the day before were worth the expense. Kincaid and Sholeh hid their faces under the deep hoods, and the warm fur held back the biting cold. A cloaked couple moving toward the caravan in the predawn light didn’t draw attention. Over thirty wagons stood in a neat row, lined up for departure. Each wagon was ready for travel with horses pawing the frozen ground, and their breath puffed in the morning air. Merchants checked their gear and tack one last time. Mercenaries and guards moved with a purpose around the caravan. Voices carried in the brisk morning. One company of mercenaries mounted on powerful steeds moved toward the front of the line. The skilled riders handled their charges as they waited for the order to start. Their tack jingled and creaked as the steeds stomped in anticipation of the move. Those dozen horses and their riders cost more than the collection of mercenaries gathering for muster. The rest of the caravan's guards were foot soldiers and archers. A train this size could attract attention, and the protection of nearly thirty warriors would deter all but the strongest lords. Fortunately, the procession was too small to be confused for an invading army. Kincaid hoped interested lords on the route of travel would just tax the caravan for passage and not waste the resources to attack. Sholeh and Kincaid made their way up the train to find their assembly area. Sholeh spotted the red banner limply hanging in the still air. They made their way through the growing crowd to the side of the wagons. Their boots crunched on the frost-painted grass. “Who do we have here? Vagabonds? Smugglers? I know, stowaways.” Kincaid glared at the man. He couldn’t pull his eyes away from the collection of rotted and crooked teeth grinning under lips too small for the cruel smile. “No, hired by Captain Adelaise.” “To do what, dig piss holes for us?” Sholeh laid a hand on Kincaid’s arm before he could clench his hands into fists. The man wore a shirt of chain mail over a stained, padded undershirt. Dirt from numerous campaigns scarred his weapons belt, and the long sword’s pommel was well-used. Not a fight they needed right now. “We are just going to find our captain and our place.” “Don’t think you children belong here in the caravan. I can find two real swords before this caravan heads out. Go home, now.” “I don’t need you interfering with my contract, Rafas. Let them pass.” “Adelaise the Bloody. Always coming up short. You must have done something special to make captain.” “Want to find out?” Adelaise didn’t break eye contact. The subtle changes in her stance didn’t go unnoticed by the veteran campaigner. The man looked from her stance to the weapons at her side. Adelaise wasn’t wearing armor, just her red shirt under a red cloak with black trim. “Fight here, in front of the merchants? Not a good way to start the trip, Adelaise. We can’t get fired before we start, right?” “Don’t make me look through the thieves and killers you’ve got in your squad, Rafas. And stay out of my company. You won’t like what you find there.” Adelaise spun away from the man and ignored the threat. Sholeh and Kincaid kept up with her pace away from the rival company. “Stay away from his company. I’ll make sure we work opposite sides of the caravan.” “What’s his problem with us?” “With the two of you, nothing. With me, everything.” She locked her gaze forward and kept moving. She wouldn’t share. The dozen men and women had the look of well-traveled warriors and carried their weapons with familiarity. As the trio approached, a few got to their feet and nodded toward their leader. It was a casual discipline, but it was clear to Kincaid who was in charge of this group. “Sholeh, Kincaid. Our company. These are our blacksmith and carpenter that will help along the way. I’ve also brought them along to fill out our swords.” The men and women nodded their recognition of the arrivals and went back into their pre-departure preparation of weapons, supplies, and gear. Adelaise pulled them off to the side. She crouched down and searched through a canvas sack like the seabags sailors carried to their ships. Adelaise found two square pieces of metal painted with bright red paint. These chunks could clasp a cloak, but they could also fasten around the neck or arm. She handed over the items and waited until they accepted the offer. Sholeh and Kincaid fumbled with their cloaks for a moment and replaced their clasps with their new company's symbol. Simple but effective insignia. “Good. Now we need weapons.” She grabbed a blade in a sheath and handed it to Kincaid. “You know how to put one of these on your belt, right?” “I trained with swords, Adelaise.” “Sure.” Kincaid grabbed the blade by the sheath and pushed aside his frustration. It wasn’t a long blade or a curved one for horseback. He had another two-foot blade. Why were women always giving him short swords? Sholeh held back a snicker as Adelaise raised an eyebrow. “Problem?” “I’m not sure what I’m going to do with this weapon on the caravan. I’m pretty sure I can’t call it a sword.” “You need to defend yourself. The people in this caravan are veterans of numerous campaigns. They’ve fought and killed, and they own their gear. Many are already members of the guild. If you walk around here with a sword strapped across your back, you will invite a fight you can’t win.” Kincaid shut his mouth. Further arguments were pointless given his first confrontation of the morning, and Kincaid secured the sheath to his belt on the first try. “I’m taking a chance with you, Sholeh.” Adelaise handed her a pair of hammers. These weren’t the work hammers of a smith. They had cruel ridges and a hooked back end. Weapons. The young smith looked at the offerings and nodded her thanks. She looped them into her belt. Kincaid shot a glance between the two women. Sholeh didn’t know Adelaise, and the sellsword captain wasn’t a native of the Empire. Why take a chance on her? Kincaid swallowed his pride and looked to the front of the caravan. “When do we move out?” Kincaid didn't want more embarrassing moments. “We’ll have a call for captains to turn in our rosters. When the riders head up the road, be ready to walk. Good boots?” “Good enough.” “We’ll find out.” Adelaise gave him a smirk and made the last check on the rest of her company. She started on her way to the lead wagon. Kincaid looked down at his worn work boots. They were the same ones Sholeh got him when he escaped from the Atros prison. He scrunched his toes in the leather to see how much room he had with his socks on. His feet slid just enough to let him know he’d have blisters before dark.",

The rest of the caravan's guards were foot soldiers and archers. A train this size could attract attention, and the protection of nearly thirty warriors would deter all but the strongest lords. Fortunately, the procession was too small to be confused for an invading army. Kincaid hoped interested lords on the route of travel would just tax the caravan for passage and not waste the resources to attack. Sholeh and Kincaid made their way up the train to find their assembly area. Sholeh spotted the red banner limply hanging in the still air. They made their way through the growing crowd to the side of the wagons. Their boots crunched on the frost-painted grass. “Who do we have here? Vagabonds? Smugglers? I know, stowaways.” Kincaid glared at the man. He couldn’t pull his eyes away from the collection of rotted and crooked teeth grinning under lips too small for the cruel smile. “No, hired by Captain Adelaise.” “To do what, dig piss holes for us?” Sholeh laid a hand on Kincaid’s arm before he could clench his hands into fists. The man wore a shirt of chain mail over a stained, padded undershirt. Dirt from numerous campaigns scarred his weapons belt, and the long sword’s pommel was well-used. Not a fight they needed right now. “We are just going to find our captain and our place.” “Don’t think you children belong here in the caravan. I can find two real swords before this caravan heads out. Go home, now.” “I don’t need you interfering with my contract, Rafas. Let them pass.” “Adelaise the Bloody. Always coming up short. You must have done something special to make captain.” “Want to find out?” Adelaise didn’t break eye contact. The subtle changes in her stance didn’t go unnoticed by the veteran campaigner. The man looked from her stance to the weapons at her side. Adelaise wasn’t wearing armor, just her red shirt under a red cloak with black trim. “Fight here, in front of the merchants? Not a good way to start the trip, Adelaise. We can’t get fired before we start, right?” “Don’t make me look through the thieves and killers you’ve got in your squad, Rafas. And stay out of my company. You won’t like what you find there.” Adelaise spun away from the man and ignored the threat. Sholeh and Kincaid kept up with her pace away from the rival company. “Stay away from his company. I’ll make sure we work opposite sides of the caravan.” “What’s his problem with us?” “With the two of you, nothing. With me, everything.” She locked her gaze forward and kept moving. She wouldn’t share. The dozen men and women had the look of well-traveled warriors and carried their weapons with familiarity. As the trio approached, a few got to their feet and nodded toward their leader. It was a casual discipline, but it was clear to Kincaid who was in charge of this group. “Sholeh, Kincaid. Our company. These are our blacksmith and carpenter that will help along the way. I’ve also brought them along to fill out our swords.” The men and women nodded their recognition of the arrivals and went back into their pre-departure preparation of weapons, supplies, and gear. Adelaise pulled them off to the side. She crouched down and searched through a canvas sack like the seabags sailors carried to their ships. Adelaise found two square pieces of metal painted with bright red paint. These chunks could clasp a cloak, but they could also fasten around the neck or arm. She handed over the items and waited until they accepted the offer. Sholeh and Kincaid fumbled with their cloaks for a moment and replaced their clasps with their new company's symbol. Simple but effective insignia. “Good. Now we need weapons.” She grabbed a blade in a sheath and handed it to Kincaid. “You know how to put one of these on your belt, right?” “I trained with swords, Adelaise.” “Sure.” Kincaid grabbed the blade by the sheath and pushed aside his frustration. It wasn’t a long blade or a curved one for horseback. He had another two-foot blade. Why were women always giving him short swords? Sholeh held back a snicker as Adelaise raised an eyebrow. “Problem?” “I’m not sure what I’m going to do with this weapon on the caravan. I’m pretty sure I can’t call it a sword.” “You need to defend yourself. The people in this caravan are veterans of numerous campaigns. They’ve fought and killed, and they own their gear. Many are already members of the guild. If you walk around here with a sword strapped across your back, you will invite a fight you can’t win.” Kincaid shut his mouth. Further arguments were pointless given his first confrontation of the morning, and Kincaid secured the sheath to his belt on the first try. “I’m taking a chance with you, Sholeh.” Adelaise handed her a pair of hammers. These weren’t the work hammers of a smith. They had cruel ridges and a hooked back end. Weapons. The young smith looked at the offerings and nodded her thanks. She looped them into her belt. Kincaid shot a glance between the two women. Sholeh didn’t know Adelaise, and the sellsword captain wasn’t a native of the Empire. Why take a chance on her? Kincaid swallowed his pride and looked to the front of the caravan. “When do we move out?” Kincaid didn't want more embarrassing moments. “We’ll have a call for captains to turn in our rosters. When the riders head up the road, be ready to walk. Good boots?” “Good enough.” “We’ll find out.” Adelaise gave him a smirk and made the last check on the rest of her company. She started on her way to the lead wagon. Kincaid looked down at his worn work boots. They were the same ones Sholeh got him when he escaped from the Atros prison. He scrunched his toes in the leather to see how much room he had with his socks on. His feet slid just enough to let him know he’d have blisters before dark.",

      "content": "Adelaise - Contract A hand shot out from the concealment of a wagon. Before the gloved hand could reach the mercenary captain, she had the arm by the wrist and twisted. A whimper and a thud followed her quick move. Adelaise put a knee in the man’s back and wrenched the arm toward the sky. Maybe she’d wait for the horses to relieve themselves. “Let me up.” Not a command. Closer to begging. Good. Adelaise released the pressure. The man used his good arm to push his face up from the gravel and rubbed his sore shoulder. He pulled back the cloak of his hood to show enough of his face to let her know he wasn’t a foe. The captain stepped between the wagons and waited. “You’ve got her.” “I’ll deliver. I always do.” “What about the boy? There’s some interest going on in the capital about him.” “Would your masters like to rewrite my contract? It’ll cost more if you want guaranteed arrival for the boy. It’ll take a lot to keep them alive as it is.” “We’re paying you for safe arrival, Adelaise. You know the consequences if you fail.” Adelaise ground her teeth. “I know why your boss wanted me on this adventure.” “Good.” The toothy grin was back as he let go of his bruised shoulder. “I want to remind you with the long journey ahead that you have a great deal at stake.” “You should get out of here before someone else recognizes you.” “What makes you think I’m not part of this convoy, Adelaise? I can sign on with another company.” “Because the caravan is work. And it has an element of danger. Not your style. You’d rather try to move the pawns around the board and live in crappy insignificant towns.” “You should watch your tongue. I have no problem taking pawns off my board.” “Your boss wouldn’t be happy. I have actual work to do.” “Betraying everyone? I’ll bet you do.” Adelaise envisioned punching those front teeth out. The bell grip on her sword was perfect for a crushing blow to an opponent’s face. Thoughts of disposing the body crossed her mind as she considered how long she had before an unnecessary investigation started. She couldn’t afford the hassle with this one, and he’d be sending a message ahead that Adelaise was fulfilling her end of the contract. She spit out the next words instead. “Will you let me do my job, or are you going to keep standing there gawking at me?” Adelaise wished it was a better retort. “You should watch out for those damned wizards. There’s already too much interest in this caravan.” “What’s your charge?” “For the threat information? Nothing. Do your job, Adelaise the Red.” “Get out of my caravan.” The man doffed his hat, presented a theater bow, and swirled his long cloak around his lanky torso. He disappeared into the town. Spies were always trouble. Adelaise wondered how she got here. The end of a wagon caravan leading a haggard group of mercenaries to the capital city of the Empire. Sellsword, spy, blademaster, betrayer. She didn’t consider this part of her childhood dreams. Boots crunched in the gravel, and draft horses kicked up dust along the length of the procession. Adelaise wanted to get back upwind of the caravan’s stagnant stench, and she stayed away from Xenres and Rafas. Her competitors had their flaws as people and challenges as leaders, but they wouldn’t tolerate dealing with spies and the Empire's politics. Adelaise used to cherish the same beliefs. You find out what you value when it's threatened. Sometimes too late. Adelaise picked up her pace to double time. Her hands gripped her weapons to keep them from swinging around her body or slapping against her legs. The gathering of caravan leadership was only moments away, and the group hovered over a foldable table with maps organized across the surface. Hash marks covered the roads across the lands to Pilaetium. With a glance, Adelaise hoped they would make better time than what these merchants planned. Her practiced eyes gauged the distances for each day’s journey. If they rolled at the projected pace, an army could muster ahead of them and wait for them in a mountain pass. They’d also race against the weather in the heights of the passes. Not a good plan. The captains reported in with their mustered strength. Quills scraped against paper as the merchants calculated the cost of their protection and the convoy's price. The traders turned to the cargo masters for the status of the loading operations. They took a report from the quartermaster on the state of their supplies. Finally, the tack masters checked in with the horses and their spares. The convoy was ready to depart. The merchants reached a quick agreement and announced the order to start. Lupak, the cavalry captain, whistled to his organization, and the mounted warriors cantered forward to pull ahead of the string of wagons. Lupak took off his hat and presented a bow to the gathering of senior officers. He leaped into his saddle and followed his forces to scout the road. No one in the expedition looked back at the small coastal town.",

      "title": "Kincaid - March Out",
      "content": "Kincaid - March Out The blisters popped, and his feet hardened from the march. Kincaid endured his suffering with a grimace as he would never tell the hardened mercenaries how much he hurt. The best he could do is keep his feet dry and change his socks. A touch of magic and he’d be light on his feet. Sholeh caught his contemplation and shook her head. How could she know? It didn’t matter; she was right. Adelaise’s company supported Sholeh and Kincaid, but each member ensured the newcomers carried their weight with guard duty and their hired skills. They pulled patrol, cleaned dishes, maintained the company’s gear, and stood watch with everyone else. The couple was frequently on the first watch and rarely pulled breakdown duties. This small gesture from the team gave them time to adjust to life on the road and conserve their strength. That was enough to get Kincaid through another day. The other foot company criticized them at every opportunity. Adelaise’s team usually didn’t bear much scrutiny, but Kincaid and Sholeh bore the brunt of the complaints. In response, Kincaid put his head down and focused on keeping his legs in motion, which was a comfortable pace with the heavy wagons. “Feet still hurt, kid? Your baby sword slowing you down?” The four rival mercenaries gathered around as Kincaid changed his socks at the halt in the journey. “You know your captain was supposed to bring swords to this caravan. When we get into those mountains, you better know how to swing a blade,” another prodded. Kincaid was too tired to take offense. Each step brought him closer to the Empire. Every night, he had a belly full of food. Even with his pack as a pillow, he slept like the dead. Sholeh snuggled close every night near the fire, and he waited until the soft rhythm of her deep sleep settled into his soul. “You listening, kid?” The voices approached. Kincaid didn’t care about them or their words. He scrunched his feet back into his boots and got up, and he didn’t need a confrontation. There were at least twenty wagons out in front of him. The company would be near the front line of the caravan, too far away to help. “How about we see that baby blade of yours?” Rafas led this small group. He was a squad leader with a nasty attitude. Kincaid didn’t need to look behind him as the smells of their dirty clothes and days of exertion preceded them. Another stench, too. Alcohol. By nightfall, they’d be angry and looking for a fight. He’d be on watch. One of the big guards clamped his meaty hand on his shoulder and pushed hard enough to spin Kincaid around. “Our company doesn’t think your captain knows how to hire swords.” “Save the fight for the bandits. Like you said, we’ll need everyone by the time we get to the mountains.” Kincaid turned away from them. He nearly flung backward on his back as the thug grabbed his cloak. “Don’t you ever turn your back on me.” “Let go of my cloak, or you won’t have a hand to hold it.” Kincaid threw the man’s arm to the side. The catcalls began. Kincaid unclasped his cloak and let it fall to the ground. He squared up against the opponent and looked him in the eyes. The weight of the sword at his hip felt out of place. “You better change your mind before you get hurt.” Kincaid snorted. “The four of you against me? Must be great warriors for sure. The finest the Empire has ever seen.” He was too tired for these childish games, like they were apprentices vying for the master’s attention. Kincaid lashed out with his fist and caught the thug in the gut. He followed with a left to the center of the body. The surprise blow was enough to knock the man to his knees. One downward blow across the man’s nose, and he’d be done. The rasp of drawn steel warned Kincaid the fight just got deadly. These people were trained warriors who wouldn’t shed a tear at his bleeding corpse. Kincaid pulled his eyes from the struggling foe and tore his short blade from his sheath and turned toward the next threat. A pair of thugs advanced on him with bared steel. They maneuvered without commands and swung wide to get him to expose one side to an attack. They’d cut him down where he stood. Use it. Show them what you are. Kincaid pushed the voice out of his mind and focused on the advancing men. At least the fourth one was occupied and helping the ringleader up from the ground. Kincaid matched the flow of the advancing blades and put his back against the closest wagon. Steel flashed, and Kincaid met the blow with a ring of steel. Surely the companies would hear this fight. His impact was powerful enough to deflect the danger away from his body and fast enough to recover before the next slash came in from the partner. On his best day, he didn’t have enough experience to beat one prepared warrior. He wasn’t that good with a blade, and they knew it. They came at him again with blades cutting through the air. Magic flooded in Kincaid’s soul and raced through his arms. He tracked each opposing warrior's movement, and Kincaid’s blade moved impossibly fast as he anticipated the path and the arc of each blade. First one deflection and then a twist toward the other. The world moved slow enough to counter the two attacks with enough time to consider his next moves. Kincaid heard the shouts from the front of the caravan and the sounds of running feet with his magic-infused senses. They wouldn’t get to him in time. Finish it. Instead of blocking the next blow, Kincaid surged forward. With the hilt of his short blade, he thrust downwards and snapped the wrist of one thug. Bones cracked, and tendons popped. Reversing the blow with uncanny speed, he punched his blade through the metal armor until the short edge came out of the man’s back. The dying thug coughed up bloody spittle from the unexpected attack. Kincaid released the blade as he’d never have the strength to withdraw it from the falling body. He spun on his feet to meet the surviving assailant. Even without a blade in his hand, he was more deadly than every warrior in this caravan. Yes. Show them. Feel it. “Kincaid, no!” Sholeh. The blade came down in a slow-motion arc. Kincaid pulled his body out of the way and launched a punch into the man’s side. Ribs gave way under chain armor. With a grunt, the man fell to his knees. Kincaid panted with his exertion and looked at his three attackers. Blood pooled around the one with the short sword still poking through his back. One lay on the ground, groaning and holding his side. The ringleader was being helped to his feet by the last one. He took two steps forward and grabbed the troublemaker by the hair, and yanked his head back to close nose to nose. “Next time, I won’t be so gentle with my baby blade, Rafas.” “Kincaid, enough.” The barked words of the command brought him back to reality. Adelaise stood next to Sholeh. Her look of disbelief matched Sholeh’s horror. He kicked the body over and pulled the sword out of the corpse. The man’s cloak became a convenient rag for the weapon. Kincaid scooped up his cloak and fastened it around his neck. “By all that is holy, what have you done?”",

      "content": "Adelaise - Choices Damn it all. Adelaise flung a rock into the darkness surrounding her company’s campfire. The voices naturally joking with the end of another day were subdued, no one willing to draw her ire. They’d set the watch and stay out of her way. He had to kill one of them. A fight between guards was not uncommon on these longer trips. The boredom got to many of these trained killers, and they’d take it out on the rival companies. In many ways, the captains of the sellswords encouraged this rivalry. Trained warriors needed to practice their skills, and a killer’s instinct would grow dull. Stories from the guild's history were passed down to captains and reminded them companies fought against each other. Friendships between units were rare. But under most scenarios, the mercenary companies ignored one another. They worked their contracts, earned their pay, and sold their services to the next payer. Captains disciplined their forces, and they did so without possibility of appeal—until things went beyond their authority. When the contract owners got involved in discipline and justice, the outcome would rarely be useful. This group of merchants and associated sellsword captains would make Kincaid pay for his indiscretion. Damn him. The merchants weren’t the only ones that were paying Adelaise. She knew Sholeh would grab her pack and head off into the darkness with Kincaid if he walked away. They wouldn’t survive a night in these lands, much less the entire journey to Pilaetium. But he killed one mercenary and wounded two others twice his size. And there was something different about the carpenter. A public flogging was enough to bring discipline back to the ranks. But that was the normal course for minor brawls. Some severe cases led to the exile of the offenders. Captains were responsible for their soldiers' discipline and could also lose a sizable portion of their contract. But dealing with death was on another level. Why did he kill one of them? Damn him. The merchants called for a leadership meeting after they set the first watch. Discipline would be on their minds, and Xenres would hunt for justice. And then he’d use this to his advantage. Revenge was a dangerous motive. And the kid brought it upon himself. As if summoned by her thoughts, the red-haired carpenter approached the brooding captain. He waited at a loose position of attention. Adelaise didn’t want to talk to him now. But she needed to hear his side of the story before she walked to the leadership meeting. Everyone deserved a chance to tell their side before being judged. She’d lived by this principle for as long as she had the opportunity to command. She waved him over. He came to attention and stood in front of her. His eyes never focused on her face, and Adelaise fought to keep her anger down. “What were you thinking, Kincaid?” “There were four of them. Self-defense.” No sense of apology in his voice. That hurts our case. If he testified this way, he’d find himself flogged or exiled from duty. Not that he wasn’t right. “It’s not enough for you to say self-defense. Others could say the same?” “You’re kidding, right?” The young man was no trained soldier, and he dropped his discipline. Those green eyes filled with a smoldering fire locked on hers. “I picked a fight with four veterans accusing me of being a kid. Everyone knows I can’t handle a weapon.” “But you hit one so hard that your short blade cut through two plates of armor. That’s not a lucky blow.” “You gave me a sword designed to do that kind of work. Thrusting blade, right?” “Kincaid, do not mistake me for a fool. I’ve seen warriors twice your size with blades longer than their bodies not deliver that kind of blow. We need a better defense.” “What am I defending? My right to defend myself? The actions I took? My version of the story? Pick one, captain.” He was getting hot. Convinced he was right. “The merchants are summoning the senior officers of the caravan, and I will have to answer for your actions. We will head into the mountains, and we are down at least two swords. And we have a body in our midst.” “I don’t see how this affects me.” “They will decide your punishment.” “Punishment?” The man’s fires subsided with the recognition of reality. “Keep your voice down, Kincaid. We are the last group of people who are on your side right now.” “I thought we hired on a company to protect a caravan and kill, if necessary.” “Not each other.” “They were after me, and I imagine they were after your company. I can make a case I was defending the caravan.” “That’s a stretch. I won’t bring that up tonight. You’re standing first watch with Sholeh. If you take one step outside of our firelight, I will have her hit you with one of those hammers.” Adelaise moved to the front of the procession after her discussion with Kincaid. She didn’t want to be the last one to arrive when the inquiry was about her company. The merchants sat on three portable benches, and several tree trunks served as seats for the rest of the arrivals. Junior members of the caravan tended to the crackling fire. Lupak, the captain of the cavalry company, was already seated. His steed was tied off to a nearby tree. He crossed his riding boots in front of him and ignored Adelaise’s arrival. Instead, he sipped from a wooden mug with steam rising from the brim into the night air. Adelaise nodded toward the merchants and chose one of the trunks nearest the fire. She couldn’t hide, so she might as well be warm. One of the servants came by and offered a mulled wine for her to sip and push back the cold. Adelaise waved him off. Not a good image for tonight. Xenres made his grand entrance into the firelight. He marched with military precision, and the full rattle of his armor and weapons made a commotion before the light revealed his features. His helm concealed his face until he pulled it off, tucked it under his arm, nodded to the merchants, and then chose his seat. He refused to look at his fellow captains. The leader of the traders sighed, leaving a white cloud in front of his face. “We should call this meeting to order. It’s too cold for formalities or reviewing of contracts. Adelaise, what do you have to say for your company.” “Self defense. No more, no less. Four people attacked my member.” “Ridiculous. The mercenary goaded my men into a fight they couldn’t win. He murdered one, crippled another, and wounded a third. This wasn’t self-defense. This caravan needs to execute justice.” Xenres would hold nothing back. “Are you implying a lone man, one we’ve all seen fumble with his sword, planned to be by himself, summon a third of your company, convince them to attack him, and then finish them off? Let’s talk about ridiculous for a moment—” “Enough. Our concern is that we have a situation before we enter the most dangerous part of our journey. Two of the companies are standing off against each other, and we are short at least two people in a contract. We must solve our problem and not point fingers.” The merchants would not let a fight start between the captains. “If I may, master merchant.” Lupak set his mulled wine on the frozen ground. He waited until the merchants gestured for him to continue. “We require the arms we have right now, and we need to ensure discipline. I propose we launch an inquiry into the matter and then hold trial when through the passes.” Armor rattled as Xenres lurched to his feet. “An investigation? What more evidence do we need than a body?” “You’ve had your say, Captain Xenres. Your company is not without fault.” Xenres closed his mouth. “Give us a moment to discuss.” The merchants swung their backs to the fire and began their deliberations. Frosty breath rose over the huddled heads, and the voices carried into the darkness. The worst case for Adelaise would have been a quick decision. As they spun back around, the faces illuminated in the flickering light revealed they were not happy with the decision. That would be enough to slow this discussion down to a level they could figure out what to do. Kincaid was a lucky man. “Captain, your suggestion is the best option we have. You will lead the investigation into this fight between companies. The rest will continue the march and offer protection.” “I object—” “It’s noted, Xenres. You will get your say again when we get through the pass. But, as one company is short, Adelaise, your company will have to pick up the additional duties. You will draw the extra patrol and the extra watch.” Adelaise groaned inside. She should have seen that coming. No way she’d be able to put Kincaid on that side of the caravan, so that meant her experienced warriors would cover down on the mess Kincaid made. Her side would be short, and even the swords she had left weren’t real warriors. “Understood.” “And the trial will happen on the other side of the passes. You will agree to these terms, or we will report both your companies to the guild.” Neither of them could oppose this solution. It was the best of the poor options they had left. And it was the best option left for Kincaid and Sholeh.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Trial",
      "content": "Kincaid - Trial The weather and terrain were formidable adversaries to the slow-moving caravan. Horses struggled under their loads, and people huddled to preserve their body heat. Kincaid regretted they left at least a week too late as the heavy wagons slipped on the ice and snow. The cavalry scouts used their horses to push through the heavy drifts for the wagons to follow. Essential repairs to the wagons kept Kincaid’s hands blistered. Cracked axels and broken wheels were backbreaking work in the narrow passes. He earned his keep every day, and none of his efforts had anything to do with his swordsmanship. He hoped the merchants would go easy on him when the imminent trial took place. On the other hand, Adelaise was hard on him. He pulled extra shifts for watch and took the most dangerous jobs in the company. At the end of every day, darkness rushed to claim his mind. He never remembered dreams, and the voice inside his head was silent as he crashed into a deep sleep. As hard as he worked on the caravan, Kincaid dreaded the thought of making it through the pass. Each step felt heavier as they crested the last hill. The idea of a trial caused his spirit to plummet into the gorges of the mountain passes. He’d been imprisoned in a tiny cell, fought his way to his freedom, struggled for his loved ones, and escaped from the clutches of the powerful Duke of Caesea. Now, he faced justice again. It wasn’t his fault. Lupak had endless energy and conducted his investigation every night as they set the watches. Kincaid’s conversation with the cavalry captain was cordial. Most importantly, the man listened. Kincaid described the setup, the four mercenaries' actions, and the brief fight to save his life. He regretted killing anyone, but the alternative was a different body on the side of the road—his. Confronting his doubts and fears was difficult. Sholeh was the warm presence in his life. She knew what he’d done and what he had to do. Of all the people in the caravan, she also knew what it cost his soul to defend himself from the four mercenaries. They huddled by the fire to share their meals. No one approached Kincaid, even as he earned his keep as a carpenter on the trip. Sholeh ignored the others and always sat next to him. “What are you going to tell the merchants, my friend?” “The same as I told the captain.” He blocked the wind with his cloak and stoked the fire into feeble existence. “I can’t believe I’m on trial because four men attacked me. I wonder if it would be different if I killed them all.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid.” Her voice trailed off into the air and the night. “I know, Sholeh. Everyone knows I can’t use a sword, but I’m under suspicion of murder.” “There is a body.” Kincaid shook his head and looked off into the morning light. The usual noises of the camp were quieter this morning. The members of the caravan waited in anticipation for the trial. “Will you tell them about the magic?” “I can’t.” That admission would change everything. If he explained his powers, then no one would believe self defense. The case against him would be he was looking to settle a score and finish the fight he didn’t start. “I agree. Be strong, Kincaid.” “After all we’ve been through to get here, we are the strongest ever.” Members of the caravan gathered in a copse of trees. The worst of the travel was behind them, and the blowing snow was a memory. Servants set up makeshift benches and seats from cut logs. Hot wine made its way among the trial observers. Even for the most experienced traders, this was the first caravan trial they’d ever witnessed. None had ever needed it. The front row of observer seats was for the captains of the companies. Out here in the wilderness, rank still had its privileges. And the caravan needed discipline. One seat remained empty at the end of the first row. The lead investigator, Lupak, had a significant role this morning, and he’d have no time for sitting and observing. Ironically, Kincaid crafted a new bench for the merchants. With the rudimentary tools from one of the wagons, he spent the evenings working with his hard-earned skills to settle his mind. Those that sat in his judgment kept their padded behinds on the work of his hands. The merchants called the meeting to order and summoned the lead investigator to begin his statements. “Master merchants. You asked me to investigate the events surrounding a death before we entered the mountain passes. I had the chance to examine the body, interview the fighters, and talk to the witnesses. And this is not an easy case.” Kincaid pulled in a sharp breath to speak. Sholeh glanced at him and shook her head. Don’t. “The accused is being charged for murder and bodily injury to two others.” Kincaid breathed an internal sigh of relief. No charges for magic. “There’s no doubt he fought four people and killed one of them. All the accounts line up the same way.” “Then what did you discover, captain.” “I can’t figure out the how or the why.” Voices rose above a murmur. Weapons and armor rattled from the guards positioned around the copse of trees. Kincaid grimaced. There was something more here. “Obviously, there are two different stories as to why the fight happened. One party claims they were goaded into a fight. The other explains they were fighting in self defense. The story of self defense rings true in my heart.” “This isn’t justice—” Xenres roared from his seat. “You will be next, Xenres, if you don’t shut your mouth.” The head merchant stared down the irate mercenary. Guards fingered their weapons. One spark and the camp would ignite. This was the opposite result from what the merchants expected. Lupak waited for the outburst to settle. As the ruckus turned to mumbles, the merchants motioned him to continue. Adelaise leaned forward in her seat. “But how does a man armed with only a short sword cut down a member of the Guild of Blades and wound two others with his hands? I’m left with that question.” He paused and looked back at the silent crowd. The captain landed his gaze on Kincaid. “I found someone who might have an explanation.” Kincaid’s heart pounded his rib cage but controlled the fear from escaping to his face. “One of the teamsters saw the accused fight in a ring in the town. A skilled boxer who took on men larger than himself.” Sholeh’s face dropped, and Kincaid couldn’t bring himself to look at Adelaise. The captain might have missed his calling in life as a barrister. He was good. Maybe too good. “Master merchants, I believe the young man fought in self-defense.” Lupak held his hands up for silence as the camp murmured. “I don’t find it reasonable that a young man would wander to the back of our caravan to find a fight with four people. If he wanted to kill one, he would have done it one-on-one.” Xenres stood up with his fists curled into balls. His chest thrust forward, and his mouth pumped his hot breath into the morning air like a bellows. But he stayed silent and controlled his outburst. Lupak paused long enough to see if there would be another outburst. He went on, “But the young man, Kincaid, was capable enough with his blade and hands to handle his own. That bothers me.” His voice trailed off. “Then you have a recommendation for this gathering?” “Yes, master merchants. I recommend exile for the mercenary, Kincaid.” Voices exploded in the copse of trees, and Xenres sat down on his stump. The grin plastered his face as he glanced between Adelaise and Kincaid. Order came back to the gathering as the merchants considered the recommendation. The group leader turned to Kincaid, “Do you have any words to say as we consider judgment?” Words tumbled through his mind as he pondered what would happen to him and Sholeh. They’d come this far, had limited funds, and were left alone. His fight cost them dearly. If Sholeh would even go with him. Find the words. Kincaid settled his mind even as the forces of magic clamored for recognition. He knew he had the words. He always did. “Master merchants, captains, ladies and gentlemen, I have a few remarks in my defense.” Kincaid paused to gather his thoughts. Adelaise shook her head, but Sholeh was riveted to his every word. “I’ve worked with many of you on this journey. We shared meals and stood watch. We fixed wagons and kept this convoy safe. We waded through the snow, pushing on wagon wheels to keep the convoy moving forward. Always forward. “The days were never easy for me. This life on the road is different from what I trained to do as a journeyman carpenter in Caesea. You helped me grow into this role and learn this life. And as we sit in this copse of trees, there’s an air of victory around us. We made it. Together. “What I’ve never done is threaten anyone in this group. So I ask you to consider my innocence.” “Other than the body and broken bones.” The voice was loud enough to carry across the gathering in the still air. Kincaid ignored the interruption but changed his tone. “Just look at me. Every mercenary in this caravan calls me a kid. I’ll bet there are some echoes of laughter in those mountain passes about me carrying this blade at my hip.” Heads nodded amongst the listeners. Kincaid kept the grin off his face and pushed his advantage. “I regret the moment I ended up alone near the end of the wagons. Each day drained my energy, and I was tired. That’s not an excuse because my captain warned me not to be alone. I was wrong. I hadn’t learned my place. “When confronted, I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have a plan to escape from four armed veterans of many campaigns. And when I had to fight, I had no choice. “Help was too far away, and they threatened my life when they drew blades. Yes, I had to fight. I had to kill. I wish I could take those moments back. I wish I could give that life back.” Kincaid paused and let the silence fall over the clearing in the trees. Each person waited for his next words. “I will put my faith in the wisdom of the master merchants.” As Kincaid sat down, all eyes turned toward the master merchants. None would envy the task now in front of them. Whispers grew as the merchants deliberated Kincaid’s fate. When they turned back to the group, none made eye contact with Kincaid. “We are very concerned with this case. In our years of working this route, none of us has encountered this breach in discipline.” The master merchant held up his hand to head off words of indignation. “This investigation revealed failures to comply with contracts from two companies. We have a body and injuries. Most concerning is the failure of leadership.” The captains dropped their heads with the leveled accusations. The Sword Guild would not be pleased with the charges brought against them, and it threatened the contracts themselves. All realized the merchants were right. “But for the sake of discipline, we must also consider the case at stake. We have mercenaries fighting amongst themselves. Self-defense or not, this is unacceptable behavior brought before this body. We will take action.” Kincaid caught himself holding his breath. He wanted to look at Sholeh and Adelaise, but he couldn’t remove his eyes off the gathering of master merchants. “Kincaid, you are exiled from this caravan. We thought about harsher punishments, but we accept that one man does not fight against four warriors. But you must also pay for your crimes. Just as importantly, the captains must understand their contracts are under review.” Sholeh jumped to her feet and drew a breath to protest, but the lead merchant silenced her by holding up his hand. He shook his head. Kincaid caught Adelaise’s glance toward the outraged Sholeh. Kincaid accepted his fate. “You are hereby thrown from this caravan. You sacrifice all rights to profits and pay. And you have until morning to pack your belongings and find your path to wherever fate may lead you.” Kincaid nodded his acknowledgment. “If we find you in the caravan after the sun clears the horizon, we will treat you as a brigand.”",

Each step felt heavier as they crested the last hill. The idea of a trial caused his spirit to plummet into the gorges of the mountain passes. He’d been imprisoned in a tiny cell, fought his way to his freedom, struggled for his loved ones, and escaped from the clutches of the powerful Duke of Caesea. Now, he faced justice again. It wasn’t his fault. Lupak had endless energy and conducted his investigation every night as they set the watches. Kincaid’s conversation with the cavalry captain was cordial. Most importantly, the man listened. Kincaid described the setup, the four mercenaries' actions, and the brief fight to save his life. He regretted killing anyone, but the alternative was a different body on the side of the road—his. Confronting his doubts and fears was difficult. Sholeh was the warm presence in his life. She knew what he’d done and what he had to do. Of all the people in the caravan, she also knew what it cost his soul to defend himself from the four mercenaries. They huddled by the fire to share their meals. No one approached Kincaid, even as he earned his keep as a carpenter on the trip. Sholeh ignored the others and always sat next to him. “What are you going to tell the merchants, my friend?” “The same as I told the captain.” He blocked the wind with his cloak and stoked the fire into feeble existence. “I can’t believe I’m on trial because four men attacked me. I wonder if it would be different if I killed them all.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid.” Her voice trailed off into the air and the night. “I know, Sholeh. Everyone knows I can’t use a sword, but I’m under suspicion of murder.” “There is a body.” Kincaid shook his head and looked off into the morning light. The usual noises of the camp were quieter this morning. The members of the caravan waited in anticipation for the trial. “Will you tell them about the magic?” “I can’t.” That admission would change everything. If he explained his powers, then no one would believe self defense. The case against him would be he was looking to settle a score and finish the fight he didn’t start. “I agree. Be strong, Kincaid.” “After all we’ve been through to get here, we are the strongest ever.” Members of the caravan gathered in a copse of trees. The worst of the travel was behind them, and the blowing snow was a memory. Servants set up makeshift benches and seats from cut logs. Hot wine made its way among the trial observers. Even for the most experienced traders, this was the first caravan trial they’d ever witnessed. None had ever needed it. The front row of observer seats was for the captains of the companies. Out here in the wilderness, rank still had its privileges. And the caravan needed discipline. One seat remained empty at the end of the first row. The lead investigator, Lupak, had a significant role this morning, and he’d have no time for sitting and observing. Ironically, Kincaid crafted a new bench for the merchants. With the rudimentary tools from one of the wagons, he spent the evenings working with his hard-earned skills to settle his mind. Those that sat in his judgment kept their padded behinds on the work of his hands. The merchants called the meeting to order and summoned the lead investigator to begin his statements. “Master merchants. You asked me to investigate the events surrounding a death before we entered the mountain passes. I had the chance to examine the body, interview the fighters, and talk to the witnesses. And this is not an easy case.” Kincaid pulled in a sharp breath to speak. Sholeh glanced at him and shook her head. Don’t. “The accused is being charged for murder and bodily injury to two others.” Kincaid breathed an internal sigh of relief. No charges for magic. “There’s no doubt he fought four people and killed one of them. All the accounts line up the same way.” “Then what did you discover, captain.” “I can’t figure out the how or the why.” Voices rose above a murmur. Weapons and armor rattled from the guards positioned around the copse of trees. Kincaid grimaced. There was something more here. “Obviously, there are two different stories as to why the fight happened. One party claims they were goaded into a fight. The other explains they were fighting in self defense. The story of self defense rings true in my heart.” “This isn’t justice—” Xenres roared from his seat. “You will be next, Xenres, if you don’t shut your mouth.” The head merchant stared down the irate mercenary. Guards fingered their weapons. One spark and the camp would ignite. This was the opposite result from what the merchants expected. Lupak waited for the outburst to settle. As the ruckus turned to mumbles, the merchants motioned him to continue. Adelaise leaned forward in her seat. “But how does a man armed with only a short sword cut down a member of the Guild of Blades and wound two others with his hands? I’m left with that question.” He paused and looked back at the silent crowd. The captain landed his gaze on Kincaid. “I found someone who might have an explanation.” Kincaid’s heart pounded his rib cage but controlled the fear from escaping to his face. “One of the teamsters saw the accused fight in a ring in the town. A skilled boxer who took on men larger than himself.” Sholeh’s face dropped, and Kincaid couldn’t bring himself to look at Adelaise. The captain might have missed his calling in life as a barrister. He was good. Maybe too good. “Master merchants, I believe the young man fought in self-defense.” Lupak held his hands up for silence as the camp murmured. “I don’t find it reasonable that a young man would wander to the back of our caravan to find a fight with four people. If he wanted to kill one, he would have done it one-on-one.” Xenres stood up with his fists curled into balls. His chest thrust forward, and his mouth pumped his hot breath into the morning air like a bellows. But he stayed silent and controlled his outburst. Lupak paused long enough to see if there would be another outburst. He went on, “But the young man, Kincaid, was capable enough with his blade and hands to handle his own. That bothers me.” His voice trailed off. “Then you have a recommendation for this gathering?” “Yes, master merchants. I recommend exile for the mercenary, Kincaid.” Voices exploded in the copse of trees, and Xenres sat down on his stump. The grin plastered his face as he glanced between Adelaise and Kincaid. Order came back to the gathering as the merchants considered the recommendation. The group leader turned to Kincaid, “Do you have any words to say as we consider judgment?” Words tumbled through his mind as he pondered what would happen to him and Sholeh. They’d come this far, had limited funds, and were left alone. His fight cost them dearly. If Sholeh would even go with him. Find the words. Kincaid settled his mind even as the forces of magic clamored for recognition. He knew he had the words. He always did. “Master merchants, captains, ladies and gentlemen, I have a few remarks in my defense.” Kincaid paused to gather his thoughts. Adelaise shook her head, but Sholeh was riveted to his every word. “I’ve worked with many of you on this journey. We shared meals and stood watch. We fixed wagons and kept this convoy safe. We waded through the snow, pushing on wagon wheels to keep the convoy moving forward. Always forward. “The days were never easy for me. This life on the road is different from what I trained to do as a journeyman carpenter in Caesea. You helped me grow into this role and learn this life. And as we sit in this copse of trees, there’s an air of victory around us. We made it. Together. “What I’ve never done is threaten anyone in this group. So I ask you to consider my innocence.” “Other than the body and broken bones.” The voice was loud enough to carry across the gathering in the still air. Kincaid ignored the interruption but changed his tone. “Just look at me. Every mercenary in this caravan calls me a kid. I’ll bet there are some echoes of laughter in those mountain passes about me carrying this blade at my hip.” Heads nodded amongst the listeners. Kincaid kept the grin off his face and pushed his advantage. “I regret the moment I ended up alone near the end of the wagons. Each day drained my energy, and I was tired. That’s not an excuse because my captain warned me not to be alone. I was wrong. I hadn’t learned my place. “When confronted, I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have a plan to escape from four armed veterans of many campaigns. And when I had to fight, I had no choice. “Help was too far away, and they threatened my life when they drew blades. Yes, I had to fight. I had to kill. I wish I could take those moments back. I wish I could give that life back.” Kincaid paused and let the silence fall over the clearing in the trees. Each person waited for his next words. “I will put my faith in the wisdom of the master merchants.” As Kincaid sat down, all eyes turned toward the master merchants. None would envy the task now in front of them. Whispers grew as the merchants deliberated Kincaid’s fate. When they turned back to the group, none made eye contact with Kincaid. “We are very concerned with this case. In our years of working this route, none of us has encountered this breach in discipline.” The master merchant held up his hand to head off words of indignation. “This investigation revealed failures to comply with contracts from two companies. We have a body and injuries. Most concerning is the failure of leadership.” The captains dropped their heads with the leveled accusations. The Sword Guild would not be pleased with the charges brought against them, and it threatened the contracts themselves. All realized the merchants were right. “But for the sake of discipline, we must also consider the case at stake. We have mercenaries fighting amongst themselves. Self-defense or not, this is unacceptable behavior brought before this body. We will take action.” Kincaid caught himself holding his breath. He wanted to look at Sholeh and Adelaise, but he couldn’t remove his eyes off the gathering of master merchants. “Kincaid, you are exiled from this caravan. We thought about harsher punishments, but we accept that one man does not fight against four warriors. But you must also pay for your crimes. Just as importantly, the captains must understand their contracts are under review.” Sholeh jumped to her feet and drew a breath to protest, but the lead merchant silenced her by holding up his hand. He shook his head. Kincaid caught Adelaise’s glance toward the outraged Sholeh. Kincaid accepted his fate. “You are hereby thrown from this caravan. You sacrifice all rights to profits and pay. And you have until morning to pack your belongings and find your path to wherever fate may lead you.” Kincaid nodded his acknowledgment. “If we find you in the caravan after the sun clears the horizon, we will treat you as a brigand.”",

      "content": "Sholeh - Fools “You can’t come with me.” “By all that is holy, you will not last an hour.” “You don’t have to go to the Empire, Sholeh.” Kincaid was such a fool. She swore four years ago she would never return, and now she stood on the border. “It’s always been about your magic, Kincaid.” He wisely considered his words, as his earlier efforts didn’t blunt her determination. “I could follow behind the caravan or range out in front of the wagons. We could still meet there.” “By all that is right and holy, Kincaid, I will not discuss this with you again. You do not have a choice in who is coming with you, and you are not heading out into the realms alone. Do I make myself clear?” He was the piece of iron between her hammer and anvil. She’d beat him into submission. He really wouldn’t last an hour in this part of the world without her. She stuffed her extra clothing and belongings into her pack. The two hammers lay on the ground with her personal items. Sholeh fingered the length of heavy leather cord at the base of each hammer. She left them and closed the flap to her bag. “You can take those.” The command was quiet but firm. “I cannot. They were part of our contract with you, and we did not live up to our terms.” Adelaise stepped into view. Her stance was relaxed, and her face expressed concern. “That’s not true, Sholeh. You are in good graces with our company, and the merchants appreciate your work as a smith. You could stay.” “You know I cannot.” “I thought I would try to change your mind, but you already made your plans. Anything I can say to keep you around the caravan? I can use your help.” After the merchants announced the verdict, many people from all parts of the caravan got up to shake Kincaid’s hand. They were disappointed with the judgment for exile, even if they understood the logic. But not Adelaise. After the exile announcement, she got up and walked away from the copse of trees and disappeared along the length of the wagon train. Sholeh considered following for a moment to apologize, but Kincaid needed her more at that moment. Sholeh shot a glance toward her friend. Guards from the company wished him farewell and words of wisdom. He’d be fine while Sholeh discovered the captain’s intent. “Kincaid and I started this journey together. When we left Caesea, we made plans to get to Pilaetium. We must finish them.” “But I can bring you to Pilaetium.” “Not together.” Adelaise looked them both over. She looked like she was calculating her odds of changing their determination. Not likely. “The master merchants asked me to give this to you, Kincaid.” She reached under her cloak and pulled out a small sack. The leather bag with a thick drawstring jingled in her hands as Kincaid turned away from the company's last members. Brushing the dirt off his pants, he reached for the bag. “What’s this?” “Accumulated pay—” “After what I’ve done? I thought the sentence—” “Kincaid, the merchants agreed with almost everything you said. The circumstances are suspicious, and the investigation revealed you were likely innocent.” “Then why are we having this discussion and saying our farewells?” “Because the merchants can’t have a war going on between our companies as we finish the last dangerous stretch of our journey. Something had to be done to keep the other infantry company in line.” “By all that is holy, the caravan is down three swords, and now they will lose two more.” “They weren’t counting on your leaving, Sholeh. So I added your salary to the bag. They’ll pay me back.” “No, we cannot accept this.” Kincaid moved forward to stand by Sholeh’s side. Adelaise shook her head and dropped her hand, still holding the small bag of wealth. “I’ve watched the two of you around our camp for the entire journey. I know if one of you leaves, the other will follow. No doubt in my mind. You need something to get your journey started, and if you are smart, you’ll have enough here to make it to the capital.” Sholeh was shocked as Kincaid reached for the bag. He shrugged his shoulders and tucked the money away. “Then we need to say thank you. And, I have to apologize for letting you down.” “Not required. I hired you on, and I’m responsible for the actions of my company. I’ve known that for a long time. I usually get more wins than losses.” She gave them both a half grin. Sholeh wondered why the mercenary captain was remarkably calm, given the threat to her career and reputation. “We will be gone before morning light, Adelaise. I hope we see you in Pilaetium.” Kincaid turned away from their former captain. “Oh, you will. I’m coming with you.” “But the company and the contract?” Kincaid fumbled with the bag at his belt and nearly spilled the wealth to the ground. Sholeh couldn’t believe her ears. “All in good stead. As you pointed out, the caravan is already short swords. So I decided to roll up the remainder of my company under Lupak and gave him the rest of the contract's rights. I can’t afford another enemy right now.” Adelaise looked them both over. “It happens.” “But not for us.” The sound in Kincaid’s voice showed the edge he felt. He didn’t want to owe anyone. “It happens in the guild fairly regularly. Normally, the roll-up of a contract happens on the battlefield when a company takes losses.” She adjusted her cloak without taking her eyes off her charges. “I will face the consequences one way or another when we get to Pilaetium. No way around that. I might as well do it with the shred of honor I have left. It will likely play out better for me. You know, leadership and all.” “I don’t know, Adelaise. You said the merchants agreed with most of the investigation.” “They did. But there is something different about you. That makes my case far more interesting. We leave before the first light.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Return",
      "content": "Sholeh - Return No longer burdened by the wagons' creeping pace and excessive setup and teardown times, the three travelers pushed across the sweeping terrain. A small group of travelers, even armed ones, could be a potential target for thieves. But Adelaise had worked these roads before and kept them clear of the potential ambush spots. The region changed from steep hills and thick forests to rolling steppes. The thigh-high grass was dry and brown, and the wind whispered fanciful stories through the stiff stalks. Rather than leave a deep trail of their passing through the grasslands, the trio kept to the trader’s road. The signs of a mighty empire’s wealth appeared around them. Rutted paths with muddy holes eager to damage wheels changed to roads paved with stones wide enough for two wagons to pass each other. Markers indicating directions toward towns stood at each crossroads, and mile markers counted the distance to the capital. Travel became easier as each day’s march found an inn and often a small farming community. Efficient movement across the empire was important for trade, military forces, and control of the dispersed lands. Caesea did not invest in this infrastructure. Kincaid stopped at a bridge over a dry riverbed. He slid down the bank to marvel at the stone arches and weight-bearing engineering. Sholeh couldn’t keep the smile off her face as the young man’s energy seemed endless as he considered the power of the Empire. Adelaise waited. No one in the inns questioned three mercenaries traveling toward the capital. Trade was slow in the winter months, and the innkeepers hungered for news of the realms. In exchange, the owners provided stories on the state of affairs at the edge of an Empire. Conversations turned to the increasing taxes on trade, and war plans meant more bodies into the army. People distant from the capital wanted to be left to their own lives. Sholeh struggled to keep her feet moving closer to Pilaetium. Weeks of travel hardened her body against the daily effort, and they had enough food and rest to continue this pace until spring, if required. But the mental barrier became higher with each footstep. This wasn’t the homecoming she preferred, and she would have been fine living out her life in the west. She wanted a life of simplicity, hard work, and rewards based on merit, not birth. Every step closer brought her farther away from that goal. And she didn’t know how to tell Kincaid why she felt this way. But she’d have to face the inevitable truth soon. Adelaise sensed the discomfort and reluctance, but she stayed silent and didn’t push the issue. Kincaid noticed her quiet days and provided comfort and strength without questioning her motives. She appreciated that he wasn’t trying to pick up her spirits, and his obvious concern helped her heavy soul. They were a strange group. A blacksmith unwilling to come back to a life she once held within the capital. A mercenary reluctant to return to face her judgment. And a wizard hoping to find answers in the uncertainty of his soul. None made for pleasant conversation. As they started the climb toward the last foothills near Pilaetium, Kincaid had the boundless energy that defined his approach to every challenge. Adelaise looked every inch the warrior, ready to face whatever appeared on the other side of the ridge. Sholeh trailed at the end of the trio. Kincaid gasped as they reached the overlook. Pilaetium was the grandest city in the world. Hills rose above a beautiful natural bay, and the city landscape thrust into the water brimming with busy docks. Towers soared toward the heavens, golden roofs reflected the fires of the afternoon sun, and buildings were pristine and white. Wide streets packed with white stones bracketed palaces, churches, and official structures. The city of Caesea, the pride of merchants and wealth in the west, was a hodgepodge collection of structures gathered on a cluster of islands in a bay. The merchant city of Caesea was an unplanned upstart of wealth haphazardly flung across the water compared to the sight below them. Pilaetium commanded respect and demanded attention. The inner wall of the capital city towered over thirty feet into the air. Square towers rose in regular intervals to watch the surrounding terrain, the bay, and the center itself. The bureaucracy of the empire thrived in this inner city, and the wealth gleamed from every building. Just outside the inner wall, structures crammed close to the center of power in the next ring. Buildings in this district were substantial and made by masters of their crafts. Stone, wood, gems, and precious metals gleamed even from this distance. Another thirty-foot wall surrounded this city ring and divided this section from the rest of the outer city. The final, outer section of the city was newer and had the look of upstart wealth struggling to compete with the old money and power arrayed above it. There were pockets of darkness and squalor in the streets, but the roads were wide and led to massive gates awaiting supplicants to the seat of power. The outer wall to the grandest city of the Empire of a Thousand Spears wasn’t finished. The city was growing too fast to allow the next wall to define the city's next ring. The design started from the waterside and worked its way inland. Sholeh could make out the dust rising from work sites cutting stone and raising the outer wall even from a distance. Sholeh hadn’t seen the construction of this new wall before she left Pilaetium years ago, and she wondered if the builders knew the course it would take around the city. Hopeful merchants and homeowners must be scrambling to buy land and build structures before the wall approached the next district. Prices likely climbed by the day. Someone would be profiting. Sholeh approached Kincaid’s side and slid her hand into his. He squeezed her palm without glancing toward her. He couldn’t tear his gaze from the capital. “I had no idea, Sholeh.” “Caesea was impressive, my friend. This is an Empire.” Kincaid gave a low chuckle. He pivoted to take in the traffic through the waterway. The bay was open, and he’d heard of the strategic position the port held for as long as history could remember. The wide bay was perfect for ships waiting at anchor to deliver their cargo. But each end of the waterway was a narrow passage through high cliffs. Military fortifications protected the courses. A naval power couldn't force the straights from either direction. The capital of the Empire straddled the strategic waterway of the world. And profited from the geography. Kincaid looked up at the afternoon sun. “Think we can make it to the wall before sunset?” “Only if the two of you stop gawking at the sights.” Adelaise moved in front of them and strode on the paved road leading toward the city's southern gates. A blockhouse, large enough for perhaps twenty people, stood beside the road. Sholeh caught the glint of steel reflected from the afternoon sun from the rooftop. The windows were slits, and the door was iron-bound wood. The customs house served as guard posts for the Empire’s forces and a money-collection point before traffic backed up at the wall. With the proper paperwork in hand, they’d breeze through scrutiny in the shadow of the walls. The trio watched two individuals leave the front door and mount horses. They were dressed in mail shirts, carried long spears in their hands, and were alert to the travelers carrying weapons. They kicked their steeds into a canter. More people took to the roof. Adelaise stopped and waited for their arrival. Sholeh tugged on Kincaid’s hand. They let the captain stay at the front of the party. “Hail, travelers. Mercenaries here in winter are never good news. Where were you for the spring campaigns?” “Not sitting in a guardhouse in the capital.” The guard with a thick, blond beard flowing from under the chinstrap glared from his warhorse. He chuckled at the unyielding stance of the mercenary captain. “If you cause problems in the city, the watch will take your head. Stay low until spring.” “Not planning to be here that long.” Adelaise made no move forward. Sholeh watched the interactions with curiosity. This was an official outpost of the city guard, and the soldiers were likely veterans of the empire’s campaigns to the east. “Have to pay for the weapons.” Kincaid stepped forward, and before he could draw breath to speak, Adelaise had her hand clamped on his shoulder. “Of course, we will pay if you have the documentation.” The other riders laughed. “The archers will take you down before you draw your sword, mercenary. We can take what we want.” Adelaise let go of Kincaid’s shoulder and dropped her hands to waist level. “True, but you’ll pay dearly for that opportunity.” “Good answer. Standard rate for the blade. No bows? Firearms?” “None.” “We’ll give you the paperwork with the seals in the blockhouse.” The riders turned away and galloped back to their outpost. As the guards from the Empire thundered away, Adelaise spun on the pair and glared at Sholeh. “You must teach this one quickly. This is the Empire. It has more rules than he understands.” Kincaid shrugged out of Sholeh’s grasp. “I know—\" “You don’t. Your instincts are good. But they are misplaced here, and they will get us killed because your methods are terrible. Let’s get our paperwork and finish this trip.” Kincaid’s shoulders slumped with the retort. Sholeh knew Adelaise was right, and Kincaid needed to listen. That was never one of his strengths. Kincaid followed the captain to the blockhouse without saying another word. After securing the documentation, Adelaise led them toward the city's outer ring and away from the growing wall. They couldn’t afford the prices closer to the walls, and the only other outlet was the docks. For now, they stayed farther inland. Adelaise picked an inn, and Sholeh was confident the destination was not random. As the captain went inside to negotiate their fees, Sholeh breathed in the smells. The stench of humanity and livestock fought against the efforts to keep the city bright and alive. Inadequate sewers kept waste in the streets even as innkeepers burned incense and herbs. Homeowners maintained plant boxes on windowsills to provide color. The underside of the city revealed more about the rotten core of the Empire’s bureaucracy. “Sholeh, where are you from?” “Right here, my friend.” “I mean, where in the Empire?” Sholeh let her amusement light her cheeks. “Pilaetium.” “This is so different.” “We must be careful because all is not what it seems.”",

      "content": "Sholeh - Return No longer burdened by the wagons' creeping pace and excessive setup and teardown times, the three travelers pushed across the sweeping terrain. A small group of travelers, even armed ones, could be a potential target for thieves. But Adelaise had worked these roads before and kept them clear of the potential ambush spots. The region changed from steep hills and thick forests to rolling steppes. The thigh-high grass was dry and brown, and the wind whispered fanciful stories through the stiff stalks. Rather than leave a deep trail of their passing through the grasslands, the trio kept to the trader’s road. The signs of a mighty empire’s wealth appeared around them. Rutted paths with muddy holes eager to damage wheels changed to roads paved with stones wide enough for two wagons to pass each other. Markers indicating directions toward towns stood at each crossroads, and mile markers counted the distance to the capital. Travel became easier as each day’s march found an inn and often a small farming community. Efficient movement across the empire was important for trade, military forces, and control of the dispersed lands. Caesea did not invest in this infrastructure. Kincaid stopped at a bridge over a dry riverbed. He slid down the bank to marvel at the stone arches and weight-bearing engineering. Sholeh couldn’t keep the smile off her face as the young man’s energy seemed endless as he considered the power of the Empire. Adelaise waited. No one in the inns questioned three mercenaries traveling toward the capital. Trade was slow in the winter months, and the innkeepers hungered for news of the realms. In exchange, the owners provided stories on the state of affairs at the edge of an Empire. Conversations turned to the increasing taxes on trade, and war plans meant more bodies into the army. People distant from the capital wanted to be left to their own lives. Sholeh struggled to keep her feet moving closer to Pilaetium. Weeks of travel hardened her body against the daily effort, and they had enough food and rest to continue this pace until spring, if required. But the mental barrier became higher with each footstep. This wasn’t the homecoming she preferred, and she would have been fine living out her life in the west. She wanted a life of simplicity, hard work, and rewards based on merit, not birth. Every step closer brought her farther away from that goal. And she didn’t know how to tell Kincaid why she felt this way. But she’d have to face the inevitable truth soon. Adelaise sensed the discomfort and reluctance, but she stayed silent and didn’t push the issue. Kincaid noticed her quiet days and provided comfort and strength without questioning her motives. She appreciated that he wasn’t trying to pick up her spirits, and his obvious concern helped her heavy soul. They were a strange group. A blacksmith unwilling to come back to a life she once held within the capital. A mercenary reluctant to return to face her judgment. And a wizard hoping to find answers in the uncertainty of his soul. None made for pleasant conversation. As they started the climb toward the last foothills near Pilaetium, Kincaid had the boundless energy that defined his approach to every challenge. Adelaise looked every inch the warrior, ready to face whatever appeared on the other side of the ridge. Sholeh trailed at the end of the trio. Kincaid gasped as they reached the overlook. Pilaetium was the grandest city in the world. Hills rose above a beautiful natural bay, and the city landscape thrust into the water brimming with busy docks. Towers soared toward the heavens, golden roofs reflected the fires of the afternoon sun, and buildings were pristine and white. Wide streets packed with white stones bracketed palaces, churches, and official structures. The city of Caesea, the pride of merchants and wealth in the west, was a hodgepodge collection of structures gathered on a cluster of islands in a bay. The merchant city of Caesea was an unplanned upstart of wealth haphazardly flung across the water compared to the sight below them. Pilaetium commanded respect and demanded attention. The inner wall of the capital city towered over thirty feet into the air. Square towers rose in regular intervals to watch the surrounding terrain, the bay, and the center itself. The bureaucracy of the empire thrived in this inner city, and the wealth gleamed from every building. Just outside the inner wall, structures crammed close to the center of power in the next ring. Buildings in this district were substantial and made by masters of their crafts. Stone, wood, gems, and precious metals gleamed even from this distance. Another thirty-foot wall surrounded this city ring and divided this section from the rest of the outer city. The final, outer section of the city was newer and had the look of upstart wealth struggling to compete with the old money and power arrayed above it. There were pockets of darkness and squalor in the streets, but the roads were wide and led to massive gates awaiting supplicants to the seat of power. The outer wall to the grandest city of the Empire of a Thousand Spears wasn’t finished. The city was growing too fast to allow the next wall to define the city's next ring. The design started from the waterside and worked its way inland. Sholeh could make out the dust rising from work sites cutting stone and raising the outer wall even from a distance. Sholeh hadn’t seen the construction of this new wall before she left Pilaetium years ago, and she wondered if the builders knew the course it would take around the city. Hopeful merchants and homeowners must be scrambling to buy land and build structures before the wall approached the next district. Prices likely climbed by the day. Someone would be profiting. Sholeh approached Kincaid’s side and slid her hand into his. He squeezed her palm without glancing toward her. He couldn’t tear his gaze from the capital. “I had no idea, Sholeh.” “Caesea was impressive, my friend. This is an Empire.” Kincaid gave a low chuckle. He pivoted to take in the traffic through the waterway. The bay was open, and he’d heard of the strategic position the port held for as long as history could remember. The wide bay was perfect for ships waiting at anchor to deliver their cargo. But each end of the waterway was a narrow passage through high cliffs. Military fortifications protected the courses. A naval power couldn't force the straights from either direction. The capital of the Empire straddled the strategic waterway of the world. And profited from the geography. Kincaid looked up at the afternoon sun. “Think we can make it to the wall before sunset?” “Only if the two of you stop gawking at the sights.” Adelaise moved in front of them and strode on the paved road leading toward the city's southern gates. A blockhouse, large enough for perhaps twenty people, stood beside the road. Sholeh caught the glint of steel reflected from the afternoon sun from the rooftop. The windows were slits, and the door was iron-bound wood. The customs house served as guard posts for the Empire’s forces and a money-collection point before traffic backed up at the wall. With the proper paperwork in hand, they’d breeze through scrutiny in the shadow of the walls. The trio watched two individuals leave the front door and mount horses. They were dressed in mail shirts, carried long spears in their hands, and were alert to the travelers carrying weapons. They kicked their steeds into a canter. More people took to the roof. Adelaise stopped and waited for their arrival. Sholeh tugged on Kincaid’s hand. They let the captain stay at the front of the party. “Hail, travelers. Mercenaries here in winter are never good news. Where were you for the spring campaigns?” “Not sitting in a guardhouse in the capital.” The guard with a thick, blond beard flowing from under the chinstrap glared from his warhorse. He chuckled at the unyielding stance of the mercenary captain. “If you cause problems in the city, the watch will take your head. Stay low until spring.” “Not planning to be here that long.” Adelaise made no move forward. Sholeh watched the interactions with curiosity. This was an official outpost of the city guard, and the soldiers were likely veterans of the empire’s campaigns to the east. “Have to pay for the weapons.” Kincaid stepped forward, and before he could draw breath to speak, Adelaise had her hand clamped on his shoulder. “Of course, we will pay if you have the documentation.” The other riders laughed. “The archers will take you down before you draw your sword, mercenary. We can take what we want.” Adelaise let go of Kincaid’s shoulder and dropped her hands to waist level. “True, but you’ll pay dearly for that opportunity.” “Good answer. Standard rate for the blade. No bows? Firearms?” “None.” “We’ll give you the paperwork with the seals in the blockhouse.” The riders turned away and galloped back to their outpost. As the guards from the Empire thundered away, Adelaise spun on the pair and glared at Sholeh. “You must teach this one quickly. This is the Empire.

      "content": "Adelaise - Deals The beer couldn’t wash away the distaste in Adelaise’s mouth. The local swill barely qualified as a beer, but it was safer than drinking anything else in this place. She choked down another swallow of the warm froth. As she looked around the dive called a bar, Adelaise reflected on how far she’d fallen. Her upbringing was distant from the embrace of the mercenary lifestyle in the Empire. She used her sword to carve a reputation and rise through the ranks of the guild. Leadership came with experience and training, and she was good with people. Adelaise managed money with finesse and could keep a company in the field. Now she was on the edge of losing it all. For what? For the woman, Sholeh. Someone important wanted her back in Pilaetium and hired a battalion of spies to track the wayward blacksmith. But the woman was not to return in chains. This was not the regular employment for a sellsword. Another distasteful swallow. She hated this job. Adelaise worked tougher contracts that left friends buried on the field of battle. This was different. She’d have to close out this contract with the spies. Without knowing who these people in the shadows were working for, Adelaise would hand over this smith's location. She liked Sholeh. They weren’t that far apart in age. Maybe six years. Both took on the world with steel in their fist and an edge in their hearts. Adelaise hated not being able to get around the contract. And it was coming due. She suspected the spies knew they arrived in the Outer City. The carpenter changed everything. For weeks, Adelaise saw the pair as a couple. They had the right attraction, and they were alone in their quest against the world. But Adelaise couldn’t see what Sholeh saw in Kincaid. He could be so naïve and optimistic in the darkest parts of a journey. He talked too much when he should be listening. The carpenter was terrible with a sword but amazing with his hands when they touched wood. Despite her initial mistrust, he earned the captain’s respect on the road. When he confronted a problem, Kincaid never backed down. What he lacked in skills, he made up in determination and raw intellect. His courage had no limits, and his integrity was beyond reproach. Most people came to admire him, despite his flaws. Sholeh definitely had a history with him, and her devotion was stronger than the steel she forged. Adelaise struggled with what she had to do next. The betrayal of their trust wasn’t a straightforward task, but she resolved to get it done. She needed to get back in the good graces of the guild. Adelaise took another pull on the terrible beer. Courage might have settled with the floaters at the bottom of the mug. “Deep thoughts, captain.” Heavy boots made their way across the packed earth floor of the bar. Soldier’s boots marching in rhythm still made their impact. Adelaise looked up from her beverage and watched the pair of guild members approach. A man and a woman with the ramrod spines of soldiers halted in front of the table. Both carried blades. At least they weren’t wearing armor. They stood for a moment at attention, but Adelaise ignored them and stared back in her beer. The man cleared his throat and waited for Adelaise's recognition. When none came, he continued, “The Committee knows, captain.” “I figured I would have a few more days before the caravan got here.” “Not when the famous Adelaise the Red shows up at an Empire blockhouse without her caravan,” the woman said. She was young, aggressive, and hungry for recognition. Not unlike Adelaise when she joined the guild. “You should have finished your contract. The committee will launch an inquiry, captain.” The man was older and wiser. He had the scars of battle and knew where his place was in the guild's hierarchy. “I expected as much. But the situation on the caravan changed. Discipline problems.” “That’s a leadership issue.” The woman’s disgust dripped into her tone. If she wanted a fight to test her steel, she might find it tonight. “At least that’s what I’ve heard.” Adelaise moved to her feet fast enough to make both take a half step back. The woman was foolish enough to place her hand on the pommel of her sword. If she moved another inch, Adelaise would show them both why she earned her place as a captain among these cutthroat mercenaries. The inn grew silent with the standoff. “Captain, we are here to summon you to answer for your actions. The leadership question will come up, and the people you accompanied to the city will also be investigated.” The man kept his hands clear of his weapons, and his tone was formal even as his words tumbled over themselves. Adelaise wouldn’t take her eyes off the woman until she stood down. The man was just doing the job in the most professional manner possible. The woman was looking for a way to earn a reputation. Adelaise didn’t want to answer for a body, and the watch wouldn’t be pleased with a mercenary fight. A brawl with another guild member was the last thing Adelaise needed tonight. The younger woman stood down first. Her hands dropped back to her sides, and she took another step back. The sounds of the inn picked up. Adelaise turned to the man and asked, “Do you have the summons?” “I do, captain.” With deliberate gestures, he reached into the pocket of his cloak. He handed over a sealed letter. Crossed swords in the red wax and precise script across the paper. This would be bad. “Your message has been delivered.” Adelaise made a show of placing the message within her cloak. The man came to attention again and turned back toward the door. The scowl never left the woman’s face. As the door slammed behind them, Adelaise stepped to the bar and gave orders to feed her companions and inform them she would be late. Receiving confirmation and paying in advance, Adelaise headed for the door. The summons sped up her timeline. The afternoon was busy with workers finishing the day’s effort on recent construction. Life of the capital had an insatiable demand for laborers to increase the glory of the Empire. Power struggles were part of the daily menu in the Inner City. Merchants, priests, bureaucrats, and imperial families vied for upper reaches of power. Spies and soldiers found their places as tools of influence. These thoughts danced across Adelaise’s consciousness as she considered her role as a pawn in this city's games. A captain could drive respect just about anywhere but Pilaetium. The entire guild was a tiny piece on the board game of power. Their current guild master opposed meddling in the politics of countries. Bad for business. If nations followed their natural course toward conflict, the guild would always have plenty of work. If only Adelaise were on her guild’s business, her heart might settle to its normal rhythm. And she’d have a chance at the inquiry. Instead, she made her way through the Middle City walls. Guards were lazy at this gate late in the day and didn’t note traffic flow as the skies changed from deep blue to evening red. Ordinary people didn’t pose a threat, and before the sun made its last plunge to the horizon, they’d shut the gates for the night. The watch would ensure peace within the walls. The scale of the houses matched the increased prosperity of this district. Not as old as the Inner City, this area still had pockets of inherited wealth combined with young money generated from the Empire’s continuing growth and success. The streets were wide and clean, and crafted stone aqueducts carried water to local fountains and pools. The sewers were effective, and they thrust the smells back into the Outer City. Amongst wealth and dwellings were the upper-end shops of masters and finer places to live, drink, and dine. Adelaise was comfortable in this part of the town. She’d grown up around wealth and wasn’t intimidated by the trappings of power like most of the lower born. That may have been part of the reason they picked her for this other contract. The Golden Wagon Inn was a good choice for travelers waiting to enter the Inner City. They were less than a hundred meters from the walls protecting the apex of power within the Empire, and this inn had a doorman at the entrance. “Good evening, Captain.” Adelaise hadn’t bothered to take off her rank at her right shoulder. No matter. Until the inquiry was complete, she’d still be a captain. “Evening. Here for a meeting.” “Of course. And welcome.” The man reached forward and pulled open the door for Adelaise. The inside was inviting. A wood stove pumped its heat into the waiting area, a small room lit by oil lamps. Paintings from around the world hung on the three walls and invited gawkers to examine the works of art. A woman waited as the exterior door closed. Without waiting for a name or introduction, the woman used her gloved hand to open the inner door and gestured for Adelaise to follow. The plush carpet under Adelaise’s boots absorbed the sound of the passage. Tapestries and curtains lined the corridor leading between private eating and meeting areas within this inn. Amongst the wealth in this room, Adelaise’s sword and dagger felt out of place. She couldn’t fight with steel what lurked in these rooms. The woman bowed and pulled back a curtain to an indeterminate room. Adelaise ducked through the opening and stepped inside. The table was beautiful craftsmanship of rare wood, but her focus was on the man on the other side of the table. Spies always sat in the shadows. The intelligence agencies must look for people that long to fill their lives with drama and intrigue. They wasted it in this place. The exquisite decor was far beyond the standard cloak and daggers. These spies were not to be trifled with. The man sitting in the shadows was cutting a fine section of meat on china. He selected each piece with a precise stab of his fork and brought the morsel to his lips. He gestured with his knife for Adelaise to sit. “Your arrival was uneventful.” The man rolled his “r”s like a growl. He stabbed another slice of meat and crammed it into his mouth. Adelaise wasn’t sure if he was asking a question or making a statement. Black eyes peered out from under bushy black eyebrows. “Ahead of schedule, but I wouldn’t call it uneventful.” “Sit, sit.” The fingers jabbed the fork into another bite. As his mouth chewed, his fingers worked the knife to hack off another piece. “You finished your task?” “Yes, she’s here in town.” The man paused the sacrifice of his slab of meat and grabbed the crystal glass of fine red wine. The Golden Wagon didn't serve substandard vintages. He swirled the liquid as it splashed across his tongue. He placed the goblet on the table and leaned forward into the light. His suntan features made his skin look leathery. “Does she know?” “Nothing. I hired her on with the caravan and brought her here.” “My employers will not appreciate deceit.” He trailed off with another growl. “She came with a young man, a carpenter. He was trying to get to Pilaetium.” “Why is he important?” Another piece of meat suffered the same fate as the others. “You paid me to bring the girl here. Are you paying extra for the boy or the info?” The knife and fork rattled on the table. “We still hold what you value, Adelaise.” He spoke her name like a deadly poison. “You’d be wise to remember that.” “Then conclude this contract. I’ve completed my part.” “I will be the judge of that. I will see the woman alive and in town before I release anything to you.” Adelaise imagined the fountain of blood if she thrust the knife on the table into the front of his throat. He wouldn’t be able to scream, and the horrific meal would be over. But she’d be no closer to her goals than before she took the caravan contract. “If we are done…” Adelaise got up from the table. “Oh, Adelaise, good luck with your inquisition. I think we’ll be doing business again.”",

The inside was inviting. A wood stove pumped its heat into the waiting area, a small room lit by oil lamps. Paintings from around the world hung on the three walls and invited gawkers to examine the works of art. A woman waited as the exterior door closed. Without waiting for a name or introduction, the woman used her gloved hand to open the inner door and gestured for Adelaise to follow. The plush carpet under Adelaise’s boots absorbed the sound of the passage. Tapestries and curtains lined the corridor leading between private eating and meeting areas within this inn. Amongst the wealth in this room, Adelaise’s sword and dagger felt out of place. She couldn’t fight with steel what lurked in these rooms. The woman bowed and pulled back a curtain to an indeterminate room. Adelaise ducked through the opening and stepped inside. The table was beautiful craftsmanship of rare wood, but her focus was on the man on the other side of the table. Spies always sat in the shadows. The intelligence agencies must look for people that long to fill their lives with drama and intrigue. They wasted it in this place. The exquisite decor was far beyond the standard cloak and daggers. These spies were not to be trifled with. The man sitting in the shadows was cutting a fine section of meat on china. He selected each piece with a precise stab of his fork and brought the morsel to his lips. He gestured with his knife for Adelaise to sit. “Your arrival was uneventful.” The man rolled his “r”s like a growl. He stabbed another slice of meat and crammed it into his mouth. Adelaise wasn’t sure if he was asking a question or making a statement. Black eyes peered out from under bushy black eyebrows. “Ahead of schedule, but I wouldn’t call it uneventful.” “Sit, sit.” The fingers jabbed the fork into another bite. As his mouth chewed, his fingers worked the knife to hack off another piece. “You finished your task?” “Yes, she’s here in town.” The man paused the sacrifice of his slab of meat and grabbed the crystal glass of fine red wine. The Golden Wagon didn't serve substandard vintages. He swirled the liquid as it splashed across his tongue. He placed the goblet on the table and leaned forward into the light. His suntan features made his skin look leathery. “Does she know?” “Nothing. I hired her on with the caravan and brought her here.” “My employers will not appreciate deceit.” He trailed off with another growl. “She came with a young man, a carpenter. He was trying to get to Pilaetium.” “Why is he important?” Another piece of meat suffered the same fate as the others. “You paid me to bring the girl here. Are you paying extra for the boy or the info?” The knife and fork rattled on the table. “We still hold what you value, Adelaise.” He spoke her name like a deadly poison. “You’d be wise to remember that.” “Then conclude this contract. I’ve completed my part.” “I will be the judge of that. I will see the woman alive and in town before I release anything to you.” Adelaise imagined the fountain of blood if she thrust the knife on the table into the front of his throat. He wouldn’t be able to scream, and the horrific meal would be over. But she’d be no closer to her goals than before she took the caravan contract. “If we are done…” Adelaise got up from the table. “Oh, Adelaise, good luck with your inquisition. I think we’ll be doing business again.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Hammering the Past",
      "content": "Sholeh - Hammering the Past “I need to run out.” Sholeh smiled as Kincaid tried to open a groggy eye. Their room had two beds, and Kincaid slept like the dead. From prisons to wooden floors to sleeping in the open, Kincaid hadn’t slept an enjoyable night sleep since his time in the carpentry shop with Master Barnet. She hated leaving him here alone. “Why?” His voice croaked, and he tried to blink away the fog in his vision. “I am concerned we did not eat with Adelaise last night.” “She paid for the meal and left a message with the staff.” He stretched and pulled his legs to the side of the bed. Kincaid had always been small, but now he was wiry with too many bones sticking through his skin. The burden of magic with not enough food was taking its toll on her young friend. “We’ll see her around.” “I am concerned that we are back in Pilaetium, and she left us last night.” “You worry too much. She could have abandoned us at the caravan or left us somewhere in the city.” “You do not know this city, Kincaid.” “How much do you know?” Sholeh turned away from him and looked toward the door. She didn’t want him to see her face. “Too much.” The bed crunched as Kincaid’s weight lifted. His barefoot feet padded across the cold floor, and his arms wrapped around her. “You are different here, Sholeh.” Sholeh didn’t turn toward him even as his warmth melted her resolve. “I will be back soon. I have to make a visit.” His feet didn’t move as she pulled away and reached for the door. She didn’t look back as the door clicked shut. This would be hard enough as it was. Sholeh moved onto the Outer City’s roads and looked up at the shadows cast by the Middle City walls. Smooth stone loomed over the streets and nearby houses. The roads were more established, and the wealth in this district rose with the proximity to the walls. These established shops were the signs of rising young wealth that tended to the Outer City's needs. These buildings had thick stone walls, bright storefronts, and maintained roads. She breathed in the smells of the capital. The population in the Outer City lived day-to-day and performed the labor of the city. The houses were compact and often stacked on top of each other. Taxes in the capital could be brutal, and families often shared the burden. At least the chilly air of the approaching winter kept the smells of the open sewer manageable this morning. The streets were uneven, built too fast, and constructed with substandard material. As the capital grew, the Empire wouldn’t tolerate the inefficient road system in town. The people here counted on the government to make this section of the city right. Guards wearing padded armor with white and red checkered dye watched the morning traffic. Leadership of the Empire and the rulers of Pilaetium didn’t want the skilled warriors of the capital to fall under a single power structure, so the City Guard was distinct from the City Watch. Competing chains of command and different responsibilities kept the city safe from itself. Sholeh knew there was a place for mercenaries within the capital and across the Empire for this exact reason. Loyalty could be bought and disbanded when no longer needed. Travelers to the Middle City faced scrutiny from the city guards. They made token efforts to find contraband and checked paperwork. Sholeh didn’t worry these guards would recognize her. She kept her cloak wrapped around her body to conceal her hammers. Even with documentation in a pocket, she’d rather not end up with the mercenary label. The guards waved her through the broad opening. The oak doors stood on massive hinges. She glanced upwards at the steel gate raised and secured, ready to crash down with the pull of a lever. Trapped forces between these grates would be shredded by archers and melted by oil. The Middle City was a stark contrast to the Outer City Sholeh left behind. The city streets of the Middle City were wide enough for two wagons to pass one another, and the cobblestone paths were straight and well-maintained. Cities and citadels in the west preferred angled roads and curves to be part of the town's defensive capabilities, but the Empire was above that. The walls stood for hundreds of years and fended off attackers by sea and land. Sholeh didn’t need to follow the street signs at each intersection. She remembered where the blacksmith guild headquarters was. Smiths and metalworkers advertised their location with the crash of steel on steel. Smoke cast pillars of darkness against the clear skies. Brimstone stung Sholeh’s eyes as ash clung to her shirt. Many years ago, her life away from the Inner City began here. Merchants ignored Sholeh as she paced the streets. She didn’t carry the signs of wealth and wasn’t worth their time to hawk wares she couldn’t afford. At the end of the track was a four-story building constructed from stone. The structure looked like a fortification on the street corner and may have been a military headquarters when the city was younger. Now, it served as a guildhall for the smiths. Sholeh paused, looked up at the sign of hammer and anvil, and took in a deep breath before walking inside. The door swung on silent hinges, a mark of the craftsmanship the guild represented. The interior hadn’t changed in the years she’d been gone. A single clerk staffed the expansive wooden desk with metal trim. He didn't lift his head from the mountain of paperwork and ledgers stacked in piles across his desk. Padded rugs from the far east covered the floor and muffled her footsteps. Light streamed in through the windows protected with thick glass. “May I help you?” “Yes, I wish to pay my respects.” “Looking for membership then?” “No, I have been a member. I have returned from travel abroad.” The man was a local and displayed the gaudy colors of the city. As a junior representative of the guild, he couldn’t afford the more delicate silks and materials the masters wore to signify their place, but he wore the woolen material suited for his position in administration. “I see. Then we should have you meet with the membership committee.” “No, I do not think so. I should greet Master Phaseal.” “That won’t be possible. He does not have walk-in hours for people to come in off the street.” “He will want to meet me. Please tell him that Sholeh is here.” “I don’t care who you are. I will see you never work in this city as a smith.” Sholeh considered her position and then examined her next action. “May I have a seat then? You should check with your superior.” Without waiting for an answer, Sholeh sat on the cushioned couch next to the administrator’s desk. Typical of a bureaucrat, he decided that it was better to seek approval than make an independent decision. Some things wouldn’t change in the Empire. The man closed his paperwork and slipped from behind his desk toward the curtain to his side. He gestured for a guard to take his place at the table. The guild had not changed. Money taxed from the sweat-stained worker filled the guild's coffers, and the wealth paid for hired swords to protect the sprawling bureaucracy and the top levels of the guild. Guards to restrain guild members were unnecessary in Caesea. As she waited, Sholeh considered her first visit to this building. Leaving the Inner City was hard, but the thought of making something of her life inspired her to create with her hands. This area once seemed intimidating to an applicant, and now she dreaded it for different reasons. The administrator pulled back the curtain and returned to the room. He looked Sholeh up and down with his eyebrows scrunched together. “The master will see you.” It must have hurt him to say that. “Thank you for bringing this to him.” “Oh, I don’t think you’ll be thanking me.” The man’s grin confirmed her fears. The guard stayed in place to watch the door, and the administrator escorted her up the back stairs. The master worked on the fourth floor and had an entire staff to support his efforts. Sholeh whisked through the waiting room and then through an inner office with three clerks working on calculations and papers. The master looked up from his desk. “Sholeh. I expected a cold day in hell before you would walk in that door.” “Coming back through this door is walking into hell.” “Why are you back?” “I wish to work at the anvil again.” “No. You scorned me once. Turned away from us.” His voice never rose above a conversational tone. “I was young, Master Phaseal. You offered too much.” “You were scared.” “Yes. And I left before my father unleashed his wrath upon this guild.” “Then you came here to risk us again?” He placed his hands upon the broad desk and leaned forward in his seat. “My father does not know I am back.” “That will take a day or less. And then the guild will be at risk.” “I came back—” “No, Sholeh. I don’t want to hear this. I don’t.” Sholeh looked down at her travel-weary boots. She listened to the strained breath from the guild’s master. He fought to keep his composure, and Sholeh wouldn’t add fuel to the fire. “You should leave. And we better not catch you working a forge in the Outer City.” “I understand.” Sholeh turned away from the master and walked toward the office. The administrator from the entrance appeared at her side and touched her elbow to guide her away from the inner chamber of power. He heard everything. “You took a risk coming back here.” The official from the front desk voice was quiet. Sholeh glanced at his face to see if it held pity or respect. His face was set and didn’t reveal his intentions. “Yes. I expected what I got, but I wonder if it was worth it.” “The price for working without guild endorsement—” “I know. I must find a different way.” “Your father?” “By all that is holy, don’t.” Sholeh stepped in front of him and took the stairs down two steps at a time. She didn’t wait for the guard to move aside as she pushed past him. The street was a welcome escape from the guild. But the sounds of the forge grated against her hearing now. The welcoming sounds of home were foreign and unexpected. Life would now be more complicated in the city. And Sholeh didn’t have any other ideas.",

      "title": "Kincaid - School of Magic",
      "content": "Kincaid - School of Magic Kincaid paced their compact room. Two beds were a welcome change from sleeping on the floor of an inn or the road's rocks. He worried the women who knew the city had left him alone. Instead of wallowing in his loneliness, Kincaid slipped on his best set of traveling clothes. He glanced at the blade resting against the wall. Sholeh took her hammers when she left, but Kincaid wouldn’t kid himself the sword would be helpful. He slid the weapon under his bed and cinched his belt. The stairs to the common room were sturdy. This low-end inn was better than any they’d seen on the other side of the mountains, but the price was steep enough to exhaust their meager reserve by the end of the week. Kincaid was done waiting for someone to help him on his quest. Time to find the hecaerae, but on his own terms. His determination faltered as he wandered toward the gates blocking the entrance to the Middle City. Kincaid had no idea where to start his search. The hecaerae had the aura of wealth and power about them, and they’d stand out. He’d begin his search in the Middle City. The guards waved him through the Middle City gates with little more than a glance in his direction. No doubt they thought he was another worker making his way to his day labor. On the other side, the expanse of humanity in this part of town seemed grander than the elaborate facades and blatant display of craftwork in Caesea. He couldn’t stop gawking and the broad roads and stone structures beckoning for business. “How does a red-haired immigrant find himself with a banished blacksmith and an outlaw mercenary?” Kincaid spun toward the voice behind him, and his blood pounded with power. “Don’t.” The voice was low. “The city tolerates magic because we do not use it on the streets. If we fight here and destroy a neighborhood, the Empire won’t be as lenient toward the schools of magic.” Kincaid sized up the man. Older than Kincaid, even with the curse of magic. He had dark features with tanned skin, black hair that refused to bear the hints of gray, and deep brown eyes. All the signs of a native of the Empire. His clothes stood out from the passersby on the streets as a wizard from Theurgia. “How did you know I would be here?” “The blacksmith already made her way to the guild house, and the mercenary will face her trial soon. A red-haired immigrant is not difficult to find.” The man’s smile was disarming. Kincaid pushed his senses to detect power in the man’s soul. Nothing. “We hoped you would come.” Kincaid tightened the flow of magic until it left his veins. The wizard nodded his appreciation. “I’m Kincaid, journeyman carpenter.” The man raised an eyebrow in surprise. He raised a hand to his chin and stroked the oiled goatee. “I was expecting a Magi. You summoned magic quickly enough when I surprised you.” Kincaid’s eyes darted to each passerby. “Do we have to have this conversation in the street?” The wizard’s face lit with humor. “Are you worried about the people of the Middle City eavesdropping on hecaerae?” Kincaid fumbled with the logic. “Where I am from, the use of magic is punishable by death.” “Where you are, we don’t use magic in the open. But the Empire accepts us as a powerful organization, as long as we are compliant. I am called Deniz.” Kincaid liked the genuine nature of the older man. His words were rich with a baritone voice, and his face didn’t hold the guile of a politician or noble. But his clothes were worth as much as a year’s pay as a journeyman. Kincaid went with his gut; he had to trust someone. “Deniz, why would your masters be waiting for me?” “Because we wanted to reach you before the Damithians did.” The statement was so matter-of-fact that Kincaid waited for him to continue. When he didn’t, Kincaid cocked his head. “And why would that be bad if the Damithians talked to me first?” “Then, the School of Theurgia wouldn’t be able to understand the power of a western magi. The professors are very interested in your capability. The reports of the destruction in Caesea reached here weeks ago.” Kincaid glanced around him to see if anyone was paying attention to their open conversation. Definitely not the topic he wanted to be discussed in the streets. They could serve you here. Once they see your power, your influence will have no bounds. The voice rang in Kincaid’s head. He fought down his pounding heartbeat and tried not to let the pain show on his face. The wizard made no notice of his discomfort. “I’m here to understand the magic of the Empire.” “That’s a fascinating statement. Why would you think it’s different from anywhere else, Kincaid?” “Because you have schools.” “That just means training and the wisdom of those who have gone before you. But like the sun rising in the east, it’s the same here.” Kincaid considered those words and tried not to let his disappointment sink into his belly. “Then why would you want to meet a wizard from the west?” “That’s a question for the masters.” Be a master here. No. “Is the school far?” Deniz smiled. “Just the Inner City.” “Then lead the way.” Kincaid fell into step with the hecaerae as they strode down the main avenue of the Middle City. The massive walls loomed over the buildings in the shadows, and Kincaid couldn’t keep his curiosity in check. He looked like an immigrant to Pilaetium, and that was fine with him. The Inner City overshadowed everything in Caesea. Even the City Council and grand docks of Caesea were no match for the soaring cathedrals, golden roofs, elaborate marble, and flower-lined rows. Here in Pilaetium, palaces and churches gleamed in the sun. Deniz slowed his pace and allowed Kincaid to gawk at the wealth. The hecaerae ignored the stares and glares of the people looking at them. The wizard’s presence avoided unnecessary questions from the guards and members of the watch. They came to a stop in front of a ten-foot wall with perfect masonry. Ivy grew up the brick walls like a leafy tapestry, and white marble crowned the wall. They followed the length until a pair of guard towers soared to the heavens. An elaborate gilded gate stood open as an inviting gesture to the knowledge that lay within. With the wizard as his guide, Kincaid walked into the school. The manicured grounds were immaculate. Gardeners fought the changing seasons and replaced the dead flowers with new growths. Other servants used handheld buckets to water the grass between the paths among the buildings. The decorative walls of the school encompassed ten buildings. Each structure had signs in gold lettering, and the ever-present ivy gave a distinguished feel to each edifice. The doors were made of exotic wood and delicate metal fastenings. Kincaid shrunk with his worker's clothes. He expected one of the supervisors to get him to work on the landscaping. Deniz led him forward into the campus and walked him along the paths toward the academic circle. Three buildings stood in the center of the paved loop. “These are the schools of Theurgia, Kincaid. For young students who demonstrate power at the earliest ages, we have an elementary school.” As he gestured, Kincaid noticed the building was a single floor with high arched windows to provide ample natural lighting. They continued their stroll around the circle. “This building is for secondary education. The students who grow up in the elementary school come here as their power matures. Older students with natural talent may also find their home here.” The building was also a single floor. “And finally, the pride of Pilaetium and the Empire is the Grand School.” This three-story structure had high arches and towers gesturing toward the sky. Every architectural feature asked the viewer to look skyward and imagine the heavens smiling down on this old facility. “This is the oldest building on the campus. Once a church, the Hecaerae of Theurgia bought this structure as the centerpiece of its school system. They modified the inside to serve as classrooms and laboratories. Now it is a testimony to the enduring power of magic in the Empire.” Kincaid paused and marveled at the stained glass work in each of the arched windows. Some of the colors and the craftsmanship reminded him of the work of the glassblowers in Caesea. No doubt they could afford the world-renown glassblowers from Caesea and have the art assembled here. “I’m impressed with the school, Deniz. But why are you giving me the tour?” “We’d like you to stay, Kincaid.” Kincaid stopped and looked at the academic circle. The university was beyond his dreams, and he wondered if Magi Cormac would have the same feelings about this dedicated school. “We even have a dormitory. Many students come from the Inner City, but most reside in the Middle City. They show for classes and their practice sessions. Some need a place to stay and focus on their studies.” “I can’t afford any of this. We barely made our way to Pilaetium.” Kincaid’s voice was above a whisper. His heart hung low in his chest as he looked at the fantastic wealth gathered here. “We have scholarships for the most talented and hardest working. If the masters see something special in you, you won’t pay a thing.” “I can’t believe it.” “Then let’s go to the administration building.” They walked by the faculty offices. Of the buildings on campus, this one was the most functional. Kincaid imagined it was the home for clergy at one point in the city’s history. The administration office entrance was open, and a roaring fire welcomed travelers to the waiting room. A brick chimney guided the smoke away from the room. Plush carpets covered the floor, and cushioned chairs and couches filled the waiting area. Kincaid couldn’t imagine how many people could be applying to this school to demand a waiting room of this size. Deniz disappeared through one of the doors. Kincaid meandered and gazed at the artwork of the school's founding leadership. Men and women in the Theurgia robes kept their unending vigil from their gilded frames. “Kincaid, you’re in luck. Three masters will be along shortly.” “What does that mean?” “Well, it’s a chance to enter the school. The rule requires at least three masters to determine acceptance. They’ll come and grab you.” Kincaid settled into the chair and sunk into the cushion. The painted faces stared down from the walls, frowning with his discomfort. Kincaid tried to crush his thoughts of inadequacy as he looked at the elaborate furnishings. What was he doing here? Following a dream. “Magi Kincaid?” The voice was gravelly and rumbled from within a man’s chest. Kincaid jumped up and turned toward the speaker. He was an older man with a volume of robes that couldn’t cover the girth of his belly. “Just Kincaid, sir.” “Well, we were hoping for more.” The voice grated deeper as he turned away with deep breaths trying to propel his weight. “We should still give him a chance.” Another person appeared at the door, a woman with pure white hair. Her thin frame stood in stark contrast to her fellow master. Her eyes danced with the reflections from the fireplace, and Kincaid thought she could peer into souls. “We did wait for him.” Another voice from another doorway. This man was the classic image of the ancient wizard. Bent over from the weight of his years and a balding head offset by a long white beard. He must scare the students. “I traveled to Pilaetium from Caesea to learn about my magic.” “Ah, then you came to the right place.” The fat man didn’t bother to turn his body around with the comment. The woman rolled her eyes and gestured for Kincaid to follow them. A wide hallway led to carpeted stairs. More pictures with masters from previous decades hung on the wall. At the top of the stairs was a common room twenty feet on a side. A lone table with five chairs stood at the opposite side of the room. The masters made their way to the center three seats. Kincaid stood with shifting feet and fidgeting hands in the middle of the room as the masters settled into their places. Servants appeared from a side room and brought drinks for those at the table. “We have been looking for a Magi from the west,” the woman started. The fat man snorted. She shot him a look and then continued. “We heard the reports of the power used in Caesea, and we understand you were involved.” “I fought the sorceratti of House Atros, and she was killed in the combat. The power we wielded was enough to destroy sections of the city.” The old man nodded as Kincaid spoke. “Then you should show us some of this vaunted power,” the fat man said as his fingers curled around the golden goblet at the table. Kincaid summoned a stream of power, and his soul leaped with joy. The song of the arcane grew to an orchestra waiting to unleash its greatest symphony. He sensed a trickle of power grow into streams from the three seated across from him. Their magic felt different from the sorceratti he fought. His heart swelled with the passion of the moment. Here, he didn’t fear the consequences of his power. This could be home. Kincaid found the sources of heat from the oil lamps and the room's fireplace and created a fireball in each hand. His magic longed for the release, to show more than the simple display of power. Kincaid banished the fireballs with a thought. “Interesting.” That was all the older woman would say. Kincaid didn’t let his confusion stifle his flow of energy. He summoned a rainbow of power and turned it into an arcane globe around him as protection against gathered forces. The power seeped into his skin, and he let himself glow with the energy within. The old wizard just kept nodding. Kincaid wasn’t sure what else to do with these masters in the room. He closed off the sources of power and waited for them. “That’s it? A bit of fire and some raw arcane energy?” “No, of course there’s more. Lightning is easy, and I can work with the very air around us.” “I say no.” The fat man went to his drink. The woman leaned forward into the table. “You have a great deal of strength within, Kincaid. But is this the extent of your abilities?” Kincaid glanced between each unyielding face. The large man wouldn’t make eye contact with him, and the old wizard kept his nodding. “The extent of my abilities is killing multiple sorceratti and destroying a section of a city. I don’t know what you are looking for.” The old man smacked his lips and said, “Something more like this.” He closed his eyes, and Kincaid felt the rush of magic. In a moment, he filled the entire room with images of dancing couples. Sparks flew from their feet with the measured pace to an unseen orchestra. The sounds of strings carried their tune to the beat of the dance. “Or this,” the gravel voice added as the dancers disappeared. Kincaid's lungs gasped as his body hungered for air. He panicked as he looked to escape the room. He summoned a surge of magic, and the oxygen returned. The old woman looked from across the table with a thin smile. In a blink, the examiners were gone from the room. A moment later, the table, chairs, carpets, and wall hangings winked from existence. Everything was gone. And then back. “Magic is more than the basic elements, Kincaid.” Her voice had the sound of regret. “I can recommend he start in secondary school.” “Bah, at best he can start with the elementary school. Magi indeed.” “I say no,” the smacking of lips stopped, and the old man no longer nodded. The woman looked between the two men and shook her head. “Kincaid, this is not the school for you. Deniz will lead you out.” Kincaid’s mouth was dry, and his feet barely followed his commands. He was escorted to the gates of the campus and left alone.",

      "content": "Kincaid - School of Magic Kincaid paced their compact room. Two beds were a welcome change from sleeping on the floor of an inn or the road's rocks. He worried the women who knew the city had left him alone. Instead of wallowing in his loneliness, Kincaid slipped on his best set of traveling clothes. He glanced at the blade resting against the wall. Sholeh took her hammers when she left, but Kincaid wouldn’t kid himself the sword would be helpful. He slid the weapon under his bed and cinched his belt. The stairs to the common room were sturdy. This low-end inn was better than any they’d seen on the other side of the mountains, but the price was steep enough to exhaust their meager reserve by the end of the week. Kincaid was done waiting for someone to help him on his quest. Time to find the hecaerae, but on his own terms. His determination faltered as he wandered toward the gates blocking the entrance to the Middle City. Kincaid had no idea where to start his search. The hecaerae had the aura of wealth and power about them, and they’d stand out. He’d begin his search in the Middle City. The guards waved him through the Middle City gates with little more than a glance in his direction. No doubt they thought he was another worker making his way to his day labor. On the other side, the expanse of humanity in this part of town seemed grander than the elaborate facades and blatant display of craftwork in Caesea. He couldn’t stop gawking and the broad roads and stone structures beckoning for business. “How does a red-haired immigrant find himself with a banished blacksmith and an outlaw mercenary?” Kincaid spun toward the voice behind him, and his blood pounded with power. “Don’t.” The voice was low. “The city tolerates magic because we do not use it on the streets. If we fight here and destroy a neighborhood, the Empire won’t be as lenient toward the schools of magic.” Kincaid sized up the man. Older than Kincaid, even with the curse of magic. He had dark features with tanned skin, black hair that refused to bear the hints of gray, and deep brown eyes. All the signs of a native of the Empire. His clothes stood out from the passersby on the streets as a wizard from Theurgia. “How did you know I would be here?” “The blacksmith already made her way to the guild house, and the mercenary will face her trial soon. A red-haired immigrant is not difficult to find.” The man’s smile was disarming. Kincaid pushed his senses to detect power in the man’s soul. Nothing. “We hoped you would come.” Kincaid tightened the flow of magic until it left his veins. The wizard nodded his appreciation. “I’m Kincaid, journeyman carpenter.” The man raised an eyebrow in surprise. He raised a hand to his chin and stroked the oiled goatee. “I was expecting a Magi. You summoned magic quickly enough when I surprised you.” Kincaid’s eyes darted to each passerby. “Do we have to have this conversation in the street?” The wizard’s face lit with humor. “Are you worried about the people of the Middle City eavesdropping on hecaerae?” Kincaid fumbled with the logic. “Where I am from, the use of magic is punishable by death.” “Where you are, we don’t use magic in the open. But the Empire accepts us as a powerful organization, as long as we are compliant. I am called Deniz.” Kincaid liked the genuine nature of the older man. His words were rich with a baritone voice, and his face didn’t hold the guile of a politician or noble. But his clothes were worth as much as a year’s pay as a journeyman. Kincaid went with his gut; he had to trust someone. “Deniz, why would your masters be waiting for me?” “Because we wanted to reach you before the Damithians did.” The statement was so matter-of-fact that Kincaid waited for him to continue. When he didn’t, Kincaid cocked his head. “And why would that be bad if the Damithians talked to me first?” “Then, the School of Theurgia wouldn’t be able to understand the power of a western magi. The professors are very interested in your capability. The reports of the destruction in Caesea reached here weeks ago.” Kincaid glanced around him to see if anyone was paying attention to their open conversation. Definitely not the topic he wanted to be discussed in the streets. They could serve you here. Once they see your power, your influence will have no bounds. The voice rang in Kincaid’s head. He fought down his pounding heartbeat and tried not to let the pain show on his face. The wizard made no notice of his discomfort. “I’m here to understand the magic of the Empire.” “That’s a fascinating statement. Why would you think it’s different from anywhere else, Kincaid?” “Because you have schools.” “That just means training and the wisdom of those who have gone before you. But like the sun rising in the east, it’s the same here.” Kincaid considered those words and tried not to let his disappointment sink into his belly. “Then why would you want to meet a wizard from the west?” “That’s a question for the masters.” Be a master here. No. “Is the school far?” Deniz smiled. “Just the Inner City.” “Then lead the way.” Kincaid fell into step with the hecaerae as they strode down the main avenue of the Middle City. The massive walls loomed over the buildings in the shadows, and Kincaid couldn’t keep his curiosity in check. He looked like an immigrant to Pilaetium, and that was fine with him. The Inner City overshadowed everything in Caesea. Even the City Council and grand docks of Caesea were no match for the soaring cathedrals, golden roofs, elaborate marble, and flower-lined rows. Here in Pilaetium, palaces and churches gleamed in the sun. Deniz slowed his pace and allowed Kincaid to gawk at the wealth. The hecaerae ignored the stares and glares of the people looking at them. The wizard’s presence avoided unnecessary questions from the guards and members of the watch. They came to a stop in front of a ten-foot wall with perfect masonry. Ivy grew up the brick walls like a leafy tapestry, and white marble crowned the wall. They followed the length until a pair of guard towers soared to the heavens. An elaborate gilded gate stood open as an inviting gesture to the knowledge that lay within. With the wizard as his guide, Kincaid walked into the school. The manicured grounds were immaculate. Gardeners fought the changing seasons and replaced the dead flowers with new growths. Other servants used handheld buckets to water the grass between the paths among the buildings. The decorative walls of the school encompassed ten buildings. Each structure had signs in gold lettering, and the ever-present ivy gave a distinguished feel to each edifice. The doors were made of exotic wood and delicate metal fastenings. Kincaid shrunk with his worker's clothes. He expected one of the supervisors to get him to work on the landscaping. Deniz led him forward into the campus and walked him along the paths toward the academic circle. Three buildings stood in the center of the paved loop. “These are the schools of Theurgia, Kincaid. For young students who demonstrate power at the earliest ages, we have an elementary school.” As he gestured, Kincaid noticed the building was a single floor with high arched windows to provide ample natural lighting. They continued their stroll around the circle. “This building is for secondary education. The students who grow up in the elementary school come here as their power matures. Older students with natural talent may also find their home here.” The building was also a single floor. “And finally, the pride of Pilaetium and the Empire is the Grand School.” This three-story structure had high arches and towers gesturing toward the sky. Every architectural feature asked the viewer to look skyward and imagine the heavens smiling down on this old facility. “This is the oldest building on the campus. Once a church, the Hecaerae of Theurgia bought this structure as the centerpiece of its school system. They modified the inside to serve as classrooms and laboratories. Now it is a testimony to the enduring power of magic in the Empire.” Kincaid paused and marveled at the stained glass work in each of the arched windows. Some of the colors and the craftsmanship reminded him of the work of the glassblowers in Caesea. No doubt they could afford the world-renown glassblowers from Caesea and have the art assembled here. “I’m impressed with the school, Deniz. But why are you giving me the tour?” “We’d like you to stay, Kincaid.” Kincaid stopped and looked at the academic circle.

      "title": "Kincaid - Sting of Failure",
      "content": "Kincaid - Sting of Failure Kincaid sat at the bar with his head clutched in his hands. The beer was adequate for his needs, and the barkeep left him alone with his sorrow. The trip from Caesea challenged his determination, but the dagger of rejection tore through his heart. There was no other plan. Kincaid followed a dying man's wishes, and he needed to understand the powers tearing apart his soul. Using magic was different in Pilaetium. The schools taught more than he could experience on his own. Magic’s curse held him back from experimenting on his own. And now he wouldn't learn anything in Pilaetium. When he began as an apprenticeship in carpentry, he worked for scraps of food and a warm place by a fire. His desire to succeed fueled his success in the shop where he was poised to become a master. Magic changed everything in Kincaid’s life, and now the same magic threatened failure. Did he abandon his power and go back to carpentry in the Empire? They must have a guild, but he could start over in this city. A new life was possible. He wouldn’t fear execution for having magic. Carpentry didn’t fill the hole inside his heart. The door swung open, and Sholeh strode in. Her jaw was set, and her cheeks twitched as she ground her teeth. Her face softened when she met his eyes. He must look worse than he thought. “By all that is holy, what happened?” “What happened to you, Sholeh?” “The blacksmiths. They will not accept me back in the guild.” “At some point, you have to tell me the rest of that story.” Her firm jaw softened. “I will, but not now. What happened?” “I found the Theurgists.” Sholeh waited for Kincaid to continue. They came to Pilaetium for the schools of magic. “They tested me, Sholeh. And I failed.” “But you are a magi…” Her disbelief tore through his heart. She wanted him to succeed and learn as much as he did. “But not good enough to earn a place in their vaunted school.” “What kind of test?” “The masters wanted to see my range of magic. I think they assumed something special from a magi of the west. They weren’t impressed with what I did. I just don’t know enough, Sholeh, and I won’t understand this power.” “You can. You need to try the other school.” “And fail again?” “By all that is holy, you will not give up. We made it to Pilaetium, and we will find you a teacher.” She was right, again. There was another school here, and Kincaid would ensure he didn’t fail. Sholeh’s beverage arrived, an orange juice thick with pulp, in a small glass. The Empire's expanse gave the people of this city more options than the standard fare of wine and beer, and Sholeh didn't drink. The door opened again, and a rush of red clothes entered the main room. Adelaise held the pommel of her long blade to steady its swing as she strode toward the bar. She paused as she caught sight of the pair. With three fingers, she motioned for another round. “Whatever you’re drinking, we’ll need more of it.” “Sounds like our first day in Pilaetium was not a good experience.” As the mugs appeared, Adelaise turned toward Kincaid and Sholeh. “What have you two been doing?” Kincaid spoke first. “I went to the school of magic in the Inner City—” “Wait, you can use magic?” Kincaid caught his thoughts midstream and looked at the mercenary captain. “Yes, I thought you knew that.” Adelaise’s head turned from Sholeh to Kincaid. One eyebrow raised. “You came here for education.” Not a question, a realization. “Yes. Just for the schools of magic.” Adelaise slumped lower in her seat. Her shoulders rolled forward, and she cupped the mug in her arms. She didn’t make eye contact again. “What happened, Adelaise?” Sholeh’s voice was insistent. “I will face the guild to defend my decision to hire you. And I’ll stand trial to see if I keep my captaincy. I don’t think it’ll go well.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid fought in self-defense in the caravan.” “That will be the best selling point. But Xenres will use the time to prepare witnesses and concoct an alternative story.” “Then you need to bring in the merchants.” “Kincaid, I can’t afford to produce the merchants. They banished you, and I left with you. That will not play out well. Even with a transfer of my contract, there's a case I still broke the terms by leaving.” “But we’re talking about you losing your rank.” Kincaid’s voice was getting too loud in the inn. At least they were the only patrons. “I know. But that doesn’t matter to the merchants. They’ll find another captain with an available company to defend their merchandise.” “What about you, Sholeh? You look the way I feel.” The change of topic was abrupt, but discussions of the trial were over. Kincaid didn’t want to spend more time on his failure. Sholeh tried to turn away from the confrontation, but emotions welled up in her eyes. “I went back to the blacksmith guild.” “Blacksmith?” Adelaise probed. “Yes, you saw my work on the caravan. I was a smith here first, and then I moved to Caesea to continue my schooling. The level of work in Caesea is far better than anything in the Empire.” “How long ago?” “I started training here five years ago.” “And they won’t take you back.” “Not after the way I left the last time.” Adelaise pulled a long sip of her frothy beverage. She placed the mug on the bar's polished surface and glanced to see where the barkeep was standing. He remained out of earshot from their conversation. “What happened at the school, Kincaid?” “Rejected me.” “So, what happens next?” Adelaise waited for either of them to respond. “I find another school. Perhaps the Damithians will take me in.” “Why bother with the school if you are already a wizard.” “I’m not. I’m more carpenter than wizard.” “But that’s how you killed that man and wounded the others.” The words hung in the air with an accusation. “Yes. I did.” Kincaid didn’t back down from the challenge. Adelaise nodded and rocked back and forth on her stool. “Then you two need to help me with my trial.” “I can't admit I’m a wizard, Adelaise. You would have to explain why you didn't know what I could do. And then when the schools find out I've used my powers to kill people...” “But you could show them what you did.” “And then I could end up in prison for killing that man on the road. The belief I was facing down four people and fought in self-defense got me free. That's not self-defense when people think I can kill four people with a stray thought. It changes everything.” “He is right, Adelaise. We cannot tell this information at your trial.” “But you can help with the version of the story we used with the merchants.” “We can do that,” Kincaid agreed. He didn’t like where this was going. Between the Blacksmith Guild and the Blade Guild, he was involved in too many things in the capital city. None of them related to the reason for their journey to get here, to find a school of wizards for his powers. But he owed Adelaise for getting them to Pilaetium and taking care of them since. “I wish there was an easier way. Three major failures are not the way I would want to start any journey. Our luck has to change soon.”",

Magic changed everything in Kincaid’s life, and now the same magic threatened failure. Did he abandon his power and go back to carpentry in the Empire? They must have a guild, but he could start over in this city. A new life was possible. He wouldn’t fear execution for having magic. Carpentry didn’t fill the hole inside his heart. The door swung open, and Sholeh strode in. Her jaw was set, and her cheeks twitched as she ground her teeth. Her face softened when she met his eyes. He must look worse than he thought. “By all that is holy, what happened?” “What happened to you, Sholeh?” “The blacksmiths. They will not accept me back in the guild.” “At some point, you have to tell me the rest of that story.” Her firm jaw softened. “I will, but not now. What happened?” “I found the Theurgists.” Sholeh waited for Kincaid to continue. They came to Pilaetium for the schools of magic. “They tested me, Sholeh. And I failed.” “But you are a magi…” Her disbelief tore through his heart. She wanted him to succeed and learn as much as he did. “But not good enough to earn a place in their vaunted school.” “What kind of test?” “The masters wanted to see my range of magic. I think they assumed something special from a magi of the west. They weren’t impressed with what I did. I just don’t know enough, Sholeh, and I won’t understand this power.” “You can. You need to try the other school.” “And fail again?” “By all that is holy, you will not give up. We made it to Pilaetium, and we will find you a teacher.” She was right, again. There was another school here, and Kincaid would ensure he didn’t fail. Sholeh’s beverage arrived, an orange juice thick with pulp, in a small glass. The Empire's expanse gave the people of this city more options than the standard fare of wine and beer, and Sholeh didn't drink. The door opened again, and a rush of red clothes entered the main room. Adelaise held the pommel of her long blade to steady its swing as she strode toward the bar. She paused as she caught sight of the pair. With three fingers, she motioned for another round. “Whatever you’re drinking, we’ll need more of it.” “Sounds like our first day in Pilaetium was not a good experience.” As the mugs appeared, Adelaise turned toward Kincaid and Sholeh. “What have you two been doing?” Kincaid spoke first. “I went to the school of magic in the Inner City—” “Wait, you can use magic?” Kincaid caught his thoughts midstream and looked at the mercenary captain. “Yes, I thought you knew that.” Adelaise’s head turned from Sholeh to Kincaid. One eyebrow raised. “You came here for education.” Not a question, a realization. “Yes. Just for the schools of magic.” Adelaise slumped lower in her seat. Her shoulders rolled forward, and she cupped the mug in her arms. She didn’t make eye contact again. “What happened, Adelaise?” Sholeh’s voice was insistent. “I will face the guild to defend my decision to hire you. And I’ll stand trial to see if I keep my captaincy. I don’t think it’ll go well.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid fought in self-defense in the caravan.” “That will be the best selling point. But Xenres will use the time to prepare witnesses and concoct an alternative story.” “Then you need to bring in the merchants.” “Kincaid, I can’t afford to produce the merchants. They banished you, and I left with you. That will not play out well. Even with a transfer of my contract, there's a case I still broke the terms by leaving.” “But we’re talking about you losing your rank.” Kincaid’s voice was getting too loud in the inn. At least they were the only patrons. “I know. But that doesn’t matter to the merchants. They’ll find another captain with an available company to defend their merchandise.” “What about you, Sholeh? You look the way I feel.” The change of topic was abrupt, but discussions of the trial were over. Kincaid didn’t want to spend more time on his failure. Sholeh tried to turn away from the confrontation, but emotions welled up in her eyes. “I went back to the blacksmith guild.” “Blacksmith?” Adelaise probed. “Yes, you saw my work on the caravan. I was a smith here first, and then I moved to Caesea to continue my schooling. The level of work in Caesea is far better than anything in the Empire.” “How long ago?” “I started training here five years ago.” “And they won’t take you back.” “Not after the way I left the last time.” Adelaise pulled a long sip of her frothy beverage. She placed the mug on the bar's polished surface and glanced to see where the barkeep was standing. He remained out of earshot from their conversation. “What happened at the school, Kincaid?” “Rejected me.” “So, what happens next?” Adelaise waited for either of them to respond. “I find another school. Perhaps the Damithians will take me in.” “Why bother with the school if you are already a wizard.” “I’m not. I’m more carpenter than wizard.” “But that’s how you killed that man and wounded the others.” The words hung in the air with an accusation. “Yes. I did.” Kincaid didn’t back down from the challenge. Adelaise nodded and rocked back and forth on her stool. “Then you two need to help me with my trial.” “I can't admit I’m a wizard, Adelaise. You would have to explain why you didn't know what I could do. And then when the schools find out I've used my powers to kill people...” “But you could show them what you did.” “And then I could end up in prison for killing that man on the road. The belief I was facing down four people and fought in self-defense got me free. That's not self-defense when people think I can kill four people with a stray thought. It changes everything.” “He is right, Adelaise. We cannot tell this information at your trial.” “But you can help with the version of the story we used with the merchants.” “We can do that,” Kincaid agreed. He didn’t like where this was going. Between the Blacksmith Guild and the Blade Guild, he was involved in too many things in the capital city. None of them related to the reason for their journey to get here, to find a school of wizards for his powers. But he owed Adelaise for getting them to Pilaetium and taking care of them since. “I wish there was an easier way. Three major failures are not the way I would want to start any journey. Our luck has to change soon.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Dream",
      "content": "Kincaid - Dream Rejection, disappointment, determination. Kincaid stared at the wooden ceiling. He pushed away the emotions and listened to the regular breathing of Sholeh’s sleep. Slumber claimed his mind and dragged him into the dream world. Magic surged unbidden into Kincaid’s veins and ignited his body. His soul howled in delight with the power pounding through his heart. Kincaid’s heartbeat raced as he fought for control of the magic invading every cell. This dream world sought to claim his life. The arcane forces submitted to the young magi's willpower, but it infused every particle of his being. His skin crackled with the energy within, and his chest hummed with power at every breath. He opened his eyes and tried to orient himself to his new surroundings. This was the most vivid dream of his life. His vision swirled from violet to a yellow filter. His mind recoiled at the colors of his environment that not only shifted but also made little sense. He was in a corridor with an arched roof. As his eyes peered through the shifting light’s swirls, granite blocks defined the structure, and the walls vibrated with the pulse of magic. Kincaid couldn’t understand how granite walls pulsed. His magic offered sight beyond human vision. The whole place defied Kincaid’s perceptions of reality. The corridor led downwards into darkness, but the yellow and violet swirls in his vision made lighting unnecessary. He wanted to turn around to find where he came from, but his torso and feet wouldn’t obey those commands. Something, or someone, compelled him to move downward. He advanced silently. Kincaid glanced down; his feet never touched the stone floor. Instead, he glided. The stuff of dreams propelled his body. As he descended the shallow slope, the walls became wet with moisture. Tears of glowing blue started at the arch's apex and then trickled along the walls to form puddles on the floor. As the pools of strange water gathered, they ran down the slope toward the bottom of the passageway. Kincaid noticed the pulsing magic matched the beat of his heart. Each throb met a pulse of energy in the walls. The pattern of the strange light in his eyes also matched the rhythm already in his veins. Connected? Yes. The voice was closer than ever. The sound came from the bottom of the corridor, not just in his mind. In a rush, Kincaid propelled himself forward to the end of the passage. With no need to move his feet, he appeared at the bottom. His heart rate and breathing never changed from the effort. A pool of water glowing with the blue power puddled in a vast entry chamber. A stone archway framed the thickest door Kincaid could imagine. The wood's craftsmanship was beyond the talents of the greatest masters of Caesea, and the work looked like it predated the founding of the island city. His hands traced the grains of the realm’s rarest woods. Exotic hardwoods from across the world were joined flawlessly together. A brush of his fingertips could not detect the attachment, and his eyes couldn’t find the fine lines. With magic coursing through his veins, he reached his senses into the structure of the door. His mind recoiled at the intricate patterns of wood that went below the surface. Individual pieces didn’t exist in this door. He found them interwoven and joined in a way that shouldn’t be possible in the physical world. He pushed his mind deeper into the door, resting his fingertips on the wood. Magic oozed from his fingers. Traces of power pushed back. Characters etched in the surface beyond human sight glowed in response. Kincaid rubbed his hands across the surface of the door and found magic infused in every part of the door. It was ancient magic. This power was beyond the confines of any soul. The magic simply was. Kincaid pushed his soul deeper and sank through the door. He felt tiny and small as his mind found only darkness. The strange filters of light in his vision faded, replaced by the depths of hungry darkness. Fear seeped into Kincaid’s soul as he found himself untethered to either dream or life. All he had left was his soul, the fragment of his being. He clung to all he had left. Your connection to life is strong. Very strong. “What are you?” More who than what. Your words are too limited to allow you to understand. “Then show me.” You are the wisest of all who have made their way here. Wisest indeed. But you are not ready. “Ready for what?” What comes ahead. “Why are you in my mind?” Interesting perspective and so unimaginative. Kincaid clutched the wisps of his being and pulled them back into himself. He rebuilt his soul one strand at a time before the darkness claimed the whispers of light. “Then enlighten me.” What makes you think I am in your mind? Kincaid shuddered from the deep cold of his soul. The awareness of self faltered at the notion he was something other than himself. Swirls of light formed at the corners of his awareness. Kincaid couldn’t call it his vision because he had the firm sense he wasn’t with his body. No, he was beyond his body. Someplace different. Someplace greater. And the voice was leading him farther. You are starting to see it now. “I don’t understand what I’m seeing.” You will. Your destiny is here, and you will do everything to find this place. “Where am I?” The laughter within Kincaid’s head was disconcerting. He felt off balance and spinning in the darkness with the voice. It was stronger than his grip on his own soul. Kincaid understood he only existed at this moment because the voice allowed it. The light pulsed again. This time, the flashes occurred to encompass every nuance of the rainbow. Like the rainbow, the colors were beyond his reach and transparent to see through them all. He saw the shape of a figure, human. But it was beyond his mind to understand the scale of the figure. He had nothing in the darkness to compare it against. Do you want to see your next vision? “I think I am seeing it now.” This is the now. The vision is of the future. “If it is like the one in Caesea…” Yes, but darker. Your path will challenge the Empire itself. The frail institutions will covet your magic, and you will have to fight back against them all. You have something they want. Something you can be. Something yet to be. “No, I don’t want this. This isn’t what I was meant to be.” You do not have a choice. “I will use my free will and—” A joke. A fiction of imagination of some priest impressing an audience. Kincaid pulled the rest of his soul together. Magic infused his spirit and gave his life strength. He was stronger here. The veins of power pulsed, and he thumped with the edge of control. The voice needed him. It feared him. Afraid of what he might do. Kincaid smiled. Good, magi. Very good. Kincaid found his body, his mind, and his soul. He rushed back into the real world. The laughter rang inside his head. The voice wasn’t afraid of him at all. He had to talk to the masters in one of the schools.",

Kincaid’s mind staggered back from the embrace of darkness and through awareness muddled by a sleepless fog. The room was silent, except for Sholeh’s regular breathing. Gloom blanketed the room, and Kincaid could see his breath as he tried to slow his panting breath. Sholeh didn’t stir. Their quarters were crafted from wood, not stone like his vision. The entire inn didn’t have an arch. The blackness didn’t have a tint, and there was no sentient awareness lingering in his consciousness. Just a lack of light before the sun made its ascent. Kincaid was alone, even in his mind. He tugged off the sweaty clothes in the morning quiet, cold drying his damp body. Rummaging through his sack, he grabbed his spare shirt and pants. Before his feet hit the frigid floor, he pulled on his boots. Kincaid glanced back once at the sleeping Sholeh. Her face was at peace as she curled under the blanket. Her chest rose and fell with each deep breath. He hated leaving her like this, but he needed to get the voice out of his head. The lock to the door clicked behind him. The pre-dawn capital was quiet with empty streets. The first fingers of smoke traced the morning skies as bakers brought their ovens to cooking temperature. It was too early for smiths to stoke their flames. Kincaid wandered through the poverty-stricken sections of Pilaetium, but his mind guided him back to the Inner City. He was unsure of his intent, but the direction felt right. The gates remained closed through the nighttime hours. Guards allowed passage through the gate, but they screened each traveler before admittance into the city's upper-class areas. He approached the nightwatchman standing at his post. “I’m on an errand for the School of Damis.” The watchman snorted as he examined Kincaid’s attire. The man stepped in closer and raised his oil lantern to view Kincaid’s face. “Why should I believe you?” “Because you wouldn’t want the hecaerae wondering what I’m doing standing at a gate.” Kincaid let a smile play across his lips. “I’ve heard better excuses to enter the Middle City. Come back in an hour when the doors open.” “I can’t wait that long.” Kincaid summoned a trickle of his magic and allowed it to light his fingertips. A glowing ball cast dancing shadows against the city walls. The watchman stepped backward and clutched his polearm in his fists. He lowered the blade with a curved hook to defend himself. Kincaid continued his smile and cocked his head to one side.

Foolish to use magic this way. Kincaid couldn’t afford to scare every guard. He ducked to get through the small door and stepped over the high lip.

      "title": "Sigurd - Working Man",
      "content": "Sigurd - Working Man One last job. Sigurd’s shoulders burned. He wedged his fingers into the gaps between the stones as his fingertips ground into the mortar. His legs throbbed from the pressure of holding his body against the wall. Will be my last job if I slip. Another month and the frost and ice would prevent even the hardened northerner from scaling the walls. He’d need specialized gear to make the climb, and the noise of spikes and ropes would make the most bored guard investigate. He had to finish the job tonight. Sigurd didn't dare adjust his position while the sentries by the window told their war stories to pass their time until their relief arrived. They hadn’t moved for the past fifteen minutes, and if they didn’t move on soon, Sigurd would have to change his plan. His employer wouldn’t be pleased with another delay. The sound of boots walking away was the cue Sigurd needed to resume his climb up the exterior wall. His dark clothes were loose against his tall body, but stains of sweat marked his exertion. Fingertips found the windowsill, and his legs positioned for a surge upwards. Getting his eyes above the sill was enough to confirm the guards moved away from his entry. The window was open a crack. Weeks of careful planning and surveillance led Sigurd to a discontent servant in this house. For a few coins, the plan came together with an unlatched window. The young man pulled the length of his body upwards and into the corridor. His booted feet contacted the carpeted floor. Excellent quality. Spared no expense for the carpeting. His prize had to be here. Sigurd stretched out the kinks in his arms and shoulders, and he loosened his legs from the climb. He didn't want to scale the way he came in, but he'd be ready. The hallway stretched to his left and right. A single gas light at the corner of the hall sputtered to give faint illumination, but the walls were bare. On the upper floor of the residence, Sigurd expected more affluence. In the houses he frequented in the middle of the night, people kept their wealth close at hand. Their precious items would be squirreled away from the rest of the world. Except for the items his employer wanted from this house. He padded along the carpeted floor, staying near the wall. If a floorboard creaked under the carpet, the guards would return to investigate. Fortunately, the padding was also thicker away from the trafficked path. Sigurd slinked deeper into the merchant’s private quarters. Sigurd crossed the hallway on the balls of his feet and paused at the single door at the end of the hall. He looked for flickers of light under the frame and then leaned in to place his ear against the door. Quiet. He reached for the handle and gave a careful push. The lock rattled its resistance to his entry. Cursing his luck, Sigurd glanced back toward the hallway. The owners would shut themselves into their chambers. His employer didn’t have enough intelligence on this household for Sigurd to do the job alone. His luck was coming up dry. He reached to his hip and grabbed his dirk. The two-foot blade slipped out of the oiled sheath and reflected the low illumination. Sigurd pushed his shoulder against the door to see if it opened from increased pressure. Nothing. Stout door. Using the blade, he worked the wood around the lock. He hoped for a simple latch that would give way to the point of the weapon, but the door would not reveal its secrets. The dirk returned to its sheath. Sigurd glanced down the hallway one more time. He held his breath to listen if the guards patrolled back to these chambers. Counting to ten, Sigurd then pulled back one stride. He slammed his boot on the lock, closest to the door frame. The explosion of wood and fragmenting metal echoed down the hall. Sigurd burst into the room and was pleased to find the bedroom empty. At least he’d picked the right night for the owners to be out. The trappings of wealth went straight to Sigurd’s gut. There was enough here to steal to set him up for a lifetime of luxury. He could buy a ship, pay for a crew, and wage wars on the seas. If he only had more time. And different instructions. The bedside tables were his first objective. Hands moved in a blur, pulling out drawers. Bags of wealth, paper, and trinkets splashed across the floor. The other side was more of the same with feminine mirrors and supplies—nothing he needed. Sigurd raced to the trunk of clothes at the foot of the bed. A heavy lock hung on stout metalwork. He calculated the damage from a blow with his sword, but he’d only mar his blade. He’d have to grab the whole chest and leave the room to search it. No time. He looked back toward the nightstands. The chest was too easy. Too predictable for the average thief to waste time on the locks. The drawers strewn across the floor were too prepared. Sigurd thrust his hands in the back of the nightstand. The jingle of mail and the thud of heavy boots approached. They’d raise the alarm when they saw the splintered wood. His fingers poked and prodded at the back panel of the nightstand. Click. A false panel slid open. A small chest, just like his employer mentioned, fell into his hands. Sigurd threw the item on the bed. It was too large to fit under his cloak, and he didn't bring a bag to hang his loot from his belt. Instead, he used one of the drawers to shatter the beautiful artwork of the chest. Shouts raised in alarm. Steel rasped clear of sheaths to prepare for combat. Sigurd flipped open the cracked chest and saw it was empty. Not a single item. The owner took the necklace with him. Complete failure. Footsteps at the door and the shout of surprise. Sigurd reached back over his right shoulder and tore the hand-and-a-half blade from its sheath. He gripped it in two hands as the guards pulled up short. They carried shorter blades, better suited for working the hallways of wealth. Both looked like they knew what they were doing with swords, but the giant who faced them was no stranger to warfare. Sigurd weaved a dance of steel in front of his body, the blade cutting through the air. The guards pressed into the room. “Put the sword down, thief.” “Take it from me.” The lead sentry made the first swipe, and steel rang against steel in the bed chamber. Sigurd’s legs were in motion as he closed the gap on the closest guard. Instead of pulling back and taking his long blade into action, he lashed out with his left fist. He hit the man’s chin like a sledgehammer. The force of the blow dropped him to the carpet. Before the other guard could pull back and block the door, Sigurd surged for the exit. The whisper of a blade swinging at his retreating backside never found its target. Sigurd picked up the pace. A window escape was out. Sigurd wouldn’t make it down a floor before a guard threw something off the ledge on him. He’d have to reach the main staircase. Sigurd doubled his speed as the patrol shouted in frustration behind him. He rounded a corner and slammed into a servant. Blankets and clothing flew into the air. The body crumpled to the ground, and Sigurd never registered the face of the hapless servant. He hoped it wasn't the woman who left the window unlatched. He liked her. But he’d lost three paces from the impact, and the pursuit drew closer. Sigurd leaped over the railing and plummeted a half flight of stairs. His boots pounded on the stone staircase as his legs absorbed the impact of the fall. He sprinted faster down the stairs. The ground floor was already awake with activity. A single guard stood at the doorway. The crossbar was still in place, barring the exit as the man drew his blade. Mail armor hung to the guard's knees, and he crouched as Sigurd continued his unrelenting surge toward him. Their blades met and slid to the cross hilts. Sigurd exploded outwards with the strength of his shoulders, and the man slammed backward against the doors. His helmeted skull rapped against the wood. The northerner reversed his blade and smashed the pommel into the man’s stomach. Breath rushed from the guard, and his mail clattered to the ground as he gasped on his hands and knees. The crossbar was designed for a pair of guards to lift its weight and length. Sigurd didn’t have time. He pushed up with the bar with his left hand and let it fall to the floor with a raucous thud. Sigurd sprinted into the courtyard as more shouts chased him. His pace took him full speed to the wall, and he threw himself upwards. With a practiced leap, he pulled himself up and over the protection of the manor house. He landed on the other side. With a patrol of the city watch only ten feet away. The giant northerner shook his head with his luck again. His dark clothes and bare steel over four feet long didn’t need the most celebrated detective to figure what he was doing jumping over a wall. Instead, he shrugged his shoulders and smiled. Sigurd returned the blade across his back with a practiced movement and sprinted away from the town watch. Shouts of men and women tore through the night air. Weapons rattled, and feet pounded against the cobblestones.",

      "content": "Sigurd - Working Man One last job. Sigurd’s shoulders burned. He wedged his fingers into the gaps between the stones as his fingertips ground into the mortar. His legs throbbed from the pressure of holding his body against the wall. Will be my last job if I slip. Another month and the frost and ice would prevent even the hardened northerner from scaling the walls. He’d need specialized gear to make the climb, and the noise of spikes and ropes would make the most bored guard investigate. He had to finish the job tonight. Sigurd didn't dare adjust his position while the sentries by the window told their war stories to pass their time until their relief arrived. They hadn’t moved for the past fifteen minutes, and if they didn’t move on soon, Sigurd would have to change his plan. His employer wouldn’t be pleased with another delay. The sound of boots walking away was the cue Sigurd needed to resume his climb up the exterior wall. His dark clothes were loose against his tall body, but stains of sweat marked his exertion. Fingertips found the windowsill, and his legs positioned for a surge upwards. Getting his eyes above the sill was enough to confirm the guards moved away from his entry. The window was open a crack. Weeks of careful planning and surveillance led Sigurd to a discontent servant in this house. For a few coins, the plan came together with an unlatched window. The young man pulled the length of his body upwards and into the corridor. His booted feet contacted the carpeted floor. Excellent quality. Spared no expense for the carpeting.

      "title": "Kincaid - Immigrants",
      "content": "Kincaid - Immigrants After bluffing his way past the guards at the Inner City gate, Kincaid wandered the streets looking for the School of Damis. Even slumbering, the Inner City breathed power. The roads were straight, clean, and in perfect repair. Oil lamps burned at regular intervals, creating overlapping pools of light. Gold and precious gems were standard as decorations and reflected the glowing lights. When he reached the secondary streets, the lampposts were farther apart, but the mansions protected by fences highlighted the city's wealth. Trying to find an elite school in the land of the elite was more difficult than he expected. Not like he had anything else to do this morning before Sholeh woke. Shouts crackled in the morning air and surprised the young carpenter. Even though he couldn’t make out the words, the tone was out of place for the Inner City. The voices approached, and Kincaid turned toward one of the small streets off the main path. He didn’t need to get involved in something else in the city. In a moment, Kincaid realized the echoes of pounding footsteps were heading his way. Blasting around the corner, the tallest young man Kincaid had ever seen bounded with an effortless gait. His braided blond hair swung with each swing of his powerful arms. The northerner’s face was relaxed even as his lungs pumped to keep oxygen flowing to his legs. Through the chase, he held a half smile. The man constantly glanced over his shoulder toward the pursuit, but the runner’s blue eyes caught sight of Kincaid. He broke his stride to avoid a head-on collision between the pair. “Hail and well met. You must move aside.” His chest pounded out a consistent breath. The man was younger than Kincaid’s first estimate. A pommel with a massive grip poked above his shoulder, and the dirk at his hip was as long as Kincaid’s sword. “You there, stop.” Guards skidded around the side street and heaved for breath from the chase. The giant man scowled at Kincaid and spun on his heel toward the pair. “Are you sure we must do this?” The man’s voice was firm and carried the power of a mountain stream rushing over a waterfall. The young man was everything Kincaid was not. “You are under arrest.” The guards approached with caution. Kincaid glanced between the newcomer and the town watch. He didn’t need this now, but the blond immigrant was fearless. “You caught me in an alley. We will see who walks out.” The newcomer reached over his shoulder and drew his steel. “Hold on. Please.” Kincaid pushed between the adversaries. “This isn’t the way we should start a morning. An immigrant in the city is under suspicion, but it shouldn’t end in death.” “Aiding the suspect? You’ll join him in a cell.” They were catching their breath. Their halberds were awkward for the alley. Shoulder to shoulder, though, they would be a threat with the long weapons. “Now, I’ve just been walking through the city.” Kincaid kept his palms open and away from his body. “Before dawn in the Inner City. Another thief.” “You should join me, yes?” The low voice was at Kincaid’s back. “You're kidding, right? Never going to be able to explain this.” Kincaid shot his words over his shoulder. Now he was committed. “Lay down your arms and surrender. We’ll put in a kind word for you when we issue charges.” The watch didn’t want a fight that could leave them injured or dead. Kincaid looked at the standoff and summoned a rush of power. His mind relished the touch of the arcane, and his veins pumped with the fire his heart craved. Each beat was a delicious reminder of what he could do. With a careful twist of arcane might, he softened the cobblestones at the patrols’ feet. Once perfect cuts by trained masons, deep cracks appeared in the rock. “Now, run.” Kincaid sprinted past the giant and plunged deeper into the alley. His new ally didn’t hesitate. The guards tried to push off and give chase, but the stones collapsed under their effort. Shouts of surprise echoed as they tripped in the magic holes and crashed in a jumble of mail and weapons. The large man was right on Kincaid’s heels as they scrambled down the alley toward one of the secondary roads. Sounds fell away as they reached the major road. The northerner peered back along their route for pursuit. Finding none, he turned those eyes back on Kincaid. “Hail and well met. I am Sigurd. Perhaps you have heard of me?” Kincaid raised his eyebrow and looked at the young man. “I’ve been here for a day, rejected by schools, and chased by the watch. I haven’t heard of you. Kincaid.” The giant youth shrugged his shoulders and gave his smile again. “They will double the watch at the gates. But the door will open with the light. We should keep moving.” “What did you do?” Kincaid needed a step and a half for each one of Sigurd’s strides. Sigurd huffed. “Working. For the wrong people again, yes?” “Again? That doesn’t sound like something I want to be part of right now.” “If they saw your red hair, you will make the report.” Kincaid didn’t need that reminder. The magi hoped the alley's darkness revealed only an insignificant man overshadowed by the northern giant with the massive blade. The length of that weapon should be enough to distract any guard. If not, he had no idea how he would explain his morning to Sholeh and Adelaise. “You have a place to hide?” The northerner had already caught his breath and looked like he was taking a stroll in the morning air. “I can’t go back to my room in the Outer City.” “No. Here.” “I’ve been in the Inner City once.” “Come with me.” The pair headed deeper into the array of alleys. For this section of the city's wealth and power, passages ran between manors, mansions, palaces, churches, and gated areas. No one with this fortune would have their property line up next to another. The shadows of the alleys provided their cover. The morning sky painted its red hues and subdued oranges. Kincaid couldn't enjoy the sunrise because he was lost. His new companion moved through the streets with confidence. “You know where you are going?” “Away from the watch, yes?” Kincaid shook his head and sighed, panting to keep pace with the big man’s strides. Sigurd guided the pair to a place where the servants gathered to filter into the Inner City before the workday began. None used the main gates and endured the scrutiny of the guards. Instead, they came in through a small sally port away from the elaborate entrances. Several inns stood near the massive doors and hugged the looming walls. “A better place to hide, yes?” Kincaid was more skeptical than Sigurd’s optimism. They moved inside the bar to find a gathering of perhaps twenty men and women. The room’s sounds rose and fell with the casual conversation of people accustomed to the privileged life in the Inner City. None paid the distinct immigrants more than a passing glance. Their day would start soon enough, and two mercenaries or personal guards wouldn’t draw their attention away from their last moments of freedom. Sigurd pulled up to the bar and motioned for beverages. Mugs appeared with draft beer, and bowls of breakfast followed. “A toast, yes?” “Early for beer, don’t you think?” “We cannot toast with water or juice. That would be stupid.” Not waiting for the toast, Sigurd threw back his head and enjoyed the beverage in his fist. An excellent brew. Far better than anything Kincaid tasted within the city. “The School of Damis. Do you know where it is?” The smile vanished from the man’s face. He spat to the side and looked back. “Magic. You should not need this.” “I know, but I have to meet with them. I wanted to be there as the sun came up. As their gates opened.” “Nothing good comes of the wizards.” “You know where they are.” Kincaid let the statement hang in the air between them. Sigurd nodded. Using a wet finger, he drew a map on the bar to show how to get to the school. He then went back to his breakfast made smoother by his beer. The smile was gone. “I should go then, Sigurd. I must see these wizards this morning. I’m at the Broken Wagon Inn in the Outer City. Not within the walls. Thank you for the breakfast and the directions.” Sigurd refused to comment. “Stay safe.”",

Mugs appeared with draft beer, and bowls of breakfast followed. “A toast, yes?” “Early for beer, don’t you think?” “We cannot toast with water or juice. That would be stupid.” Not waiting for the toast, Sigurd threw back his head and enjoyed the beverage in his fist. An excellent brew. Far better than anything Kincaid tasted within the city. “The School of Damis. Do you know where it is?” The smile vanished from the man’s face. He spat to the side and looked back. “Magic. You should not need this.” “I know, but I have to meet with them. I wanted to be there as the sun came up. As their gates opened.” “Nothing good comes of the wizards.” “You know where they are.” Kincaid let the statement hang in the air between them. Sigurd nodded. Using a wet finger, he drew a map on the bar to show how to get to the school. He then went back to his breakfast made smoother by his beer. The smile was gone. “I should go then, Sigurd. I must see these wizards this morning. I’m at the Broken Wagon Inn in the Outer City. Not within the walls. Thank you for the breakfast and the directions.” Sigurd refused to comment. “Stay safe.”",

      "content": "Kincaid - Damis Kincaid eyed the workers gathering their belongings for a day of work. The banter ended, and gazes shifted downwards to avoid eye contact. They assumed the persona of servants even before they reached their employment. The Inner City was the home of the powerful, and these workers were essential to the capital's continued operation. However, they were servants and workers unable to climb the rungs of power. Kincaid felt bad for each one of them as he watched them file out the door. As an apprentice and journeyman in Caesea, he never felt this bad about a day’s work. Kincaid followed them out and matched their posture as he roamed the streets. Sigurd’s makeshift map was helpful. The roads followed the path his fingers traced on the bar, and the directions based on Sigurd's descriptions were better than trying to follow street signs. As he walked the last few streets, his heart pounded with anticipation. His future came down to this one major school. In a moment, Kincaid stood in front of the gates of Damis. Unlike the old wealth of Theurgia, Damis had a different feel as he peered inside. Where Theurgia had gates covered in gold and elaborate artwork, Theurgia had simpler walls and wide doors. The buildings inside the courtyard were still impressive. Classical designs inspired the school's grounds. White marble columns rose and joined with domes and arched roofs. The simplicity was also its elegance as each line and column was an intricate part of the design. The campus had the feel of an ancient senate ready for day-long debate. The guards at the gate looked Kincaid up and down. “Deliveries at the back gate.” “I’m not here with goods. Could you direct me to the administration building?” “Why are you here?” “I’d like to apply to the school.” The guards chuckled at him. “The building to the right. Good luck.” They watched his travel as he made his way toward the building. Kincaid guessed they’d stop him if he moved deeper into the campus. Massive oak doors blocked his way. The craftsmanship was excellent, with smooth cuts and perfect angles. He pulled on the doors, and flawless balanced amazed him. The thick wood swung with the slightest tug. Kincaid waved and gave the guards a crooked smile. They turned away and faced the street. He stepped inside. Instead of plush carpeting and elaborate tapestries, Kincaid’s boots banged against the marble floor. Paintings by the great masters of the Empire hung in exotic wooden frames and drew the eyes to the wall. He never had time for art galleries in Caesea, and his mind rejected this to be an administration building. His feet dragged as he gawked at the collection. But he caught a glimpse of someone sitting at a desk at the end of the hall. The man looked up from his paperwork with annoyance etched into his face. Dark eyes assessed Kincaid’s approach and dared him to approach the desk. “You must be in the wrong place.” Kincaid pulled up short of the table. This wasn’t the welcome he was expecting. “I came to apply to the school.” “This isn’t an audition. You can find the theater—” “I need to talk to someone who can test me.” “I’d say you’d already failed.” Footsteps echoed as someone else approached. The pace quickened as a silence grew to a canyon between the men. Kincaid was not moving because of an obstinate door guard. “Cordelon, who is this?” A young woman caught up in the volume of her robes rounded the corner from behind the columns in the grand hallway. She had piercing brown eyes under close-cropped brown hair. She shot the doorman a look, and her gaze shifted toward Kincaid. “Someone seeking an audition.” She turned those brown eyes on Kincaid, and her face flashed recognition. Her eyes softened, and the young woman glowed from within. The young magi felt he was now on display. “Not an audition, Cordelon. Admission. And we should admit this one.” “Why, because the rabble asked nicely?” “No, because he is a Magi from the west. Caesea, in fact.” The woman walked around Kincaid, and his face grew hot from the unusual inspection. As she completed her circuit, she came forward and held out her hand. “I take it you’re Kincaid?” “I am. How could you know that?” “You are distinctive and the only Magi I know. I’m Darya.” Kincaid considered the odds to this point. Nothing had gone his way, and now he ran into another obstacle. “I came here to learn from your school.” The desk clerk, Cordelon, deepened his scowl. The woman nodded her head. “Then we will go to admissions.” “Good luck with your audition.” Kincaid ignored the comment and followed the woman to the back of the grand hallway. She told Kincaid they’d have to wait while the school gathered something she called a quorum. The excited whisper of robes swishing and soft boots hurrying toward an unseen room echoed everywhere. Kincaid caught the formal robes of the Damithians. The next thing Kincaid noticed was the people gathering were old. Finally, his youthful escort summoned him to enter the room at the back of the hallway. He stood at the center of a sweeping concave table. The table had seats for perhaps seventeen people, but only seven masters with thick gold braids at their sleeves sat at the table. “Welcome, Magi Kincaid.” The older woman at the center of the group gave him a smile. “We understand you wish to learn from us?” Kincaid straightened his posture. “I do.” “Tell us about your education.” A man near the edge asked without sounding confrontational. Kincaid fumbled with his hands as he considered his answer. No point in lying here. “I've learned through experience.” “Then no formal training…” “No. In Caesea—\" “Perhaps you could describe the theory of arcane and physical world interaction.” The woman asking must assume this would be an easy one. She offered him an encouraging smile. “Other than summoning the force to affect the physical world, I don’t know.” Several shook their heads. Another one tried a question. “Then tell us how you discovered your powers.” Kincaid pressed with the truth again. “I didn’t know I had them for the longest time. But I found myself in the fight for my life, and the magic came.” “A fight for your life? What did you do with your power?” “I ended up killing several people. Magic filled my fists, and I used my power to change the environment.” The council became silent. Even his escort couldn’t make eye contact with him. “If you step outside. We must decide.” Kincaid shifted his feet to the door. No one would take him in. He’d come this far, and none of the schools would take him? Back to carpentry? He promised Magi Cormac. His dream was real. His escort cleared her throat and waited. She mouthed the words “I’m sorry” as she waited. The act of kindness allowed him to steel his heart. The Council waited for him to reach the center of the room, and Kincaid paused with his feet shoulder-width apart and clasped his hands behind his back. He never looked down. He forced his gaze on each member of the committee. Make them blink first. “Magi Kincaid, on behalf of the school, we regret to inform you we are unable to approve your candidacy.” The woman in the center made reluctant eye contact. Rejection. Formal rejection. “Your methods regarding the use of magic are considered unethical by school standards. We debated if you could join us and harness this energy. Alas, we thought we could not.” Kincaid nodded. He turned away from the group and headed to the exit. The padding of footfalls hustled to keep up with his pace. His escort must be paid to get him out of the school without trouble. No matter. He’d go. “Kincaid, wait.” Kincaid didn’t pause a single step. She clutched his arm and tried to pull him close. “There is another way.” Kincaid stopped and faced her. “I’m listening.” “We meet in two days in the Middle City at the Falling Roses. And I’ll show you.” She walked him out of the school without exchanging another word.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Summons",
      "content": "Adelaise - Summons “Hail and well met.” The voice came from a tall young man with braided blond hair and blue eyes that sparkled like scattered sunlight reflecting off a frozen lake. His smile was broad and open. Adelaise did not understand why the man was approaching their table. Kincaid shifted in his seat and glanced around like he wanted to be anywhere else but the common room eating a meal with his companions. Sholeh cocked her head to the side and watched his nonverbal language. “Kincaid, you did not tell them.” “I didn’t think you would come to our inn.” Adelaise got up from the table. Even members of her guild weren’t so brazen with the display of weaponry, and he wouldn’t catch her sitting while she figured out his intent. “Adelaise the Red.” “Sigurd. Thief and Warrior. Perhaps you have heard of me?” “Fortunately, no. And we don’t need a thief or warrior.” “A table of foreigners.” His eyes caught the weapons the women carried. “And warriors. With Kincaid’s invitation, I am here.” Adelaise turned to the young man and waited for his explanation. “Yes, I met Sigurd yesterday. It was more of a collision. Or a run-in.” “By all that is holy, Kincaid. I have heard you tell better tales than this.” Sigurd walked away from the group. His long strides took him to the bar where he placed an order. Adelaise appreciated the time for her companions to discuss without him hovering over the conversation. “Faster, Kincaid. Before the giant returns.” Adelaise kept her anger under control. “I was in the Inner City, trying to find the School of Damis—” “You were gone before the sun came up, my friend. Looking for a school before the morning light?” “You got through the Middle and Inner City gates at night?” Adelaise cocked her head. This pair was unique from any other contract. “Do you two want to tell the story? It might be faster.” The women checked their next questions and waited for Kincaid to continue. “He was running from the watch, and our paths crossed.” “By all that is holy, the watch is searching for you?” “I don’t think they are looking for me. It was Sigurd they were chasing through the streets.” “But you picked his side.” Adelaise sighed and rolled her eyes. Her job was about Sholeh, but this inexperienced man continually diverted her attention and changed the plans on the fly. She might have to separate them. “I didn’t so much as choose a side as help him get away. Immigrants often have to band together.” He held his pleading look as he glanced toward Sholeh. Adelaise caught that she was having none of it. Sigurd returned to the table and placed his frothy mug and a bowl of soup in a vacant spot. He reached back and grabbed a chair from an adjacent table. His weight settled into the wooden structure, and he took a long drink from his mug. “This is terrible.” His nose scrunched, and he wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve. “And yet you stay with us.” Adelaise looked over the length of his worn pommel. The leather had been replaced several times, and this weapon was no stranger to combat. Sigurd chuckled as he spooned a heap of food. “Sigurd, you’ve joined the table of failed immigrants. We get rejected by guilds, and we find danger regularly. And that’s always more fun in a capital city. You’ve found an interesting group.” Kincaid’s effort to disarm the situation fell flat. “Then we should change our luck, yes? Find a good merchant to steal from and make our way into the world.” Another long drink. “By all that is holy, we will not be stealing from merchants in the capital. Is this how you found him, Kincaid?” The carpenter turned away from the question as his cheeks heated to a soft pink. Adelaise wasn’t sure how this would go for their growing group. Keeping Kincaid and Sholeh nearby was enough work for the mercenary captain, and this new northerner would make her life harder. She didn’t need the complications. Adelaise motioned for their meal from the curious staff, but she wasn’t interested in a mug of beer this early in the day. She sized up the newcomer. The man plowing through his food was young. He was trying to grow a beard and mustache, but the stubble was uneven and not impressive. But the size of his arms and muscles flexing at his forearms showed a warrior used to a hard life. He lived by those swords. Their meal arrived with glasses of juice and bowls of the same soup Sigurd already plowed through. “You drink the juice of fruit? It is not safe to drink.” Sholeh raised her eyebrow, grabbed one a glass, and then pulled a long drink. “It is very safe.” “Then, it is not wise. Good beer, ale, or spirits are the best, yes?” “No, Sigurd, they are not. The capital is a dangerous place, and always having the edge of alcohol is its own danger.” Adelaise put a hand on Sholeh’s forearm. “She does not drink, does she?” Sigurd leaned over and confided in Kincaid. Kincaid leaned away from the northerner with a horrified look across his face. He would not pick sides again. Adelaise pulled her bowl toward her and caught the edge of a piece of paper under the pot. She dragged her breakfast closer and palmed the scrap into her hand. Sigurd watched her action, but he couldn’t have seen her movement. Instead, Sigurd motioned for another drink and leaned back in his chair. His eyes landed on each of his new companions, but Adelaise found his face unreadable other than the playful twinkle in his eyes. Instead, the group turned back to their meal. No conversation was necessary as they ate, and anything would be awkward around their new companion. Sholeh didn’t hide her displeasure with frequent glares in the northerner’s direction. Kincaid leaned away from the young man to build space, and the carpenter kept his eyes focused on his food and drink to avoid another discussion. Voices rose above the sounds of the common room. “You are still here, Adelaise.” This day keeps getting better, Adelaise thought. “I’ve only been in the town for a few days. Where else would I be?” “Making our job easier.” A pair of mercenaries crossed the room. Chairs scraped, and tables banged as people left their breakfast. Workers readying for another day of labor didn’t want part of a fight between mercenaries. The barkeep and his help sized up the weapons. A battle here would be destructive. “That depends on what you are looking for. We could make your job very hard.” “No doubt. But we aren’t here on a contract, and you know we aren’t assassins. Just messengers today.” “Historically, messengers don’t carry their weapons. You look like soldiers expecting trouble.” Most mercenaries preferred certain weapons, but all were careful within the confines of Pilaetium to avoid the guard and the watch. They doubted Adelaise would take their message well. “Only because we were coming to you.” The pair glanced toward Adelaise’s companions. “And it appears the new company you are forming.” “Not a company.” She cut off that line of thinking. “These two were my hires and got me kicked off the caravan. This one is recent.” “Save your story for the inquiry.” The woman mercenary spoke for the first time. The man glanced over at her and gave a slight shake of his head. Adelaise caught his meaning. They hadn’t come here for bloodshed. “Adelaise the Red, the Guild of Blades summons you to face your inquiry. At this board, a jury of captains will review your actions as captain under contract. Do you understand this summons?” “Yes, am I permitted to bring witnesses?” The pair faltered. They usually had to deliver a message, and the recipients would be quiet and accept their fate. Mercenary captains were different, and no one remembered the last time an officer faced a disciplinary board. “Yes, I would think so.” “Good, you may finish your task.” Back in command. The man pulled paperwork sealed with red wax out of his cloak pocket and handed it to Adelaise. “The board meets this afternoon, an hour before the dinner bell. Do not be late.” The pair turned away from the table. Adelaise turned the letter over in her hands. A formal summons with the seal of the guild. She’d add this paperwork to her collection of administrative actions, but this time it was serious. It’d be a disciplinary board, which meant they already completed a preliminary hearing. Captain Xenres got to them and delivered his tale. Or maybe members of his company. With the summons in her lap, she slipped the scrap of paper delivered under the bowl into her hand and reviewed it. We have much to talk about. Same place, tonight. You don’t have a choice. The handwriting was a flowing script, clear and defined—more meaning than a scrap of paper. Sigurd had a raised eyebrow as he caught her actions. Thief indeed.",

The capital is a dangerous place, and always having the edge of alcohol is its own danger.” Adelaise put a hand on Sholeh’s forearm. “She does not drink, does she?” Sigurd leaned over and confided in Kincaid. Kincaid leaned away from the northerner with a horrified look across his face. He would not pick sides again. Adelaise pulled her bowl toward her and caught the edge of a piece of paper under the pot. She dragged her breakfast closer and palmed the scrap into her hand. Sigurd watched her action, but he couldn’t have seen her movement. Instead, Sigurd motioned for another drink and leaned back in his chair. His eyes landed on each of his new companions, but Adelaise found his face unreadable other than the playful twinkle in his eyes. Instead, the group turned back to their meal. No conversation was necessary as they ate, and anything would be awkward around their new companion. Sholeh didn’t hide her displeasure with frequent glares in the northerner’s direction. Kincaid leaned away from the young man to build space, and the carpenter kept his eyes focused on his food and drink to avoid another discussion. Voices rose above the sounds of the common room. “You are still here, Adelaise.” This day keeps getting better, Adelaise thought. “I’ve only been in the town for a few days. Where else would I be?” “Making our job easier.” A pair of mercenaries crossed the room. Chairs scraped, and tables banged as people left their breakfast. Workers readying for another day of labor didn’t want part of a fight between mercenaries. The barkeep and his help sized up the weapons. A battle here would be destructive. “That depends on what you are looking for. We could make your job very hard.” “No doubt. But we aren’t here on a contract, and you know we aren’t assassins. Just messengers today.” “Historically, messengers don’t carry their weapons. You look like soldiers expecting trouble.” Most mercenaries preferred certain weapons, but all were careful within the confines of Pilaetium to avoid the guard and the watch. They doubted Adelaise would take their message well. “Only because we were coming to you.” The pair glanced toward Adelaise’s companions. “And it appears the new company you are forming.” “Not a company.” She cut off that line of thinking. “These two were my hires and got me kicked off the caravan. This one is recent.” “Save your story for the inquiry.” The woman mercenary spoke for the first time. The man glanced over at her and gave a slight shake of his head. Adelaise caught his meaning. They hadn’t come here for bloodshed. “Adelaise the Red, the Guild of Blades summons you to face your inquiry. At this board, a jury of captains will review your actions as captain under contract. Do you understand this summons?” “Yes, am I permitted to bring witnesses?” The pair faltered. They usually had to deliver a message, and the recipients would be quiet and accept their fate. Mercenary captains were different, and no one remembered the last time an officer faced a disciplinary board. “Yes, I would think so.” “Good, you may finish your task.” Back in command. The man pulled paperwork sealed with red wax out of his cloak pocket and handed it to Adelaise. “The board meets this afternoon, an hour before the dinner bell. Do not be late.” The pair turned away from the table. Adelaise turned the letter over in her hands. A formal summons with the seal of the guild. She’d add this paperwork to her collection of administrative actions, but this time it was serious. It’d be a disciplinary board, which meant they already completed a preliminary hearing. Captain Xenres got to them and delivered his tale. Or maybe members of his company. With the summons in her lap, she slipped the scrap of paper delivered under the bowl into her hand and reviewed it. We have much to talk about. Same place, tonight. You don’t have a choice. The handwriting was a flowing script, clear and defined—more meaning than a scrap of paper. Sigurd had a raised eyebrow as he caught her actions. Thief indeed.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Trial",
      "content": "Sholeh - Trial Sholeh's life collapsed around her, and she could not imagine how to fix it. Their ongoing expenses drained their small cash reserve, and if the mercenary captain lost her status within the guild, they were in trouble on a new level. The group committed everything to Kincaid's magic. And they would not resort to thievery. How could Kincaid help this thug? If the watch was hunting the northerner, the entire group would fall under suspicion. If the Inner City noted their small group, Sholeh shuddered. “I hope you two will come with me to the inquiry.” “Three.” “I’m glad you can count, Sigurd. But I need the two witnesses there, not another observer. And I don’t want the guild to think I’m assembling a new company for hire.” “If you must fight your way out, you will need another sword. I am not sure if Kincaid carries one, yes?” “By all that is holy, we will not fight and die in the guild house. Especially the Sword Guild.” Sholeh’s fires burned from this man’s desire for action. The trial would be a spectacle, and the toughest fighters in the Empire would be in attendance. All muscles, no brain. Wisely, Sigurd kept his mouth shut. “Sigurd, I’m not sure you should make your way to the upper city.” Kincaid tried to reason with the man, but his tone was too soft for Sholeh’s liking. He sounded like he was pleading rather than directing. “I was not chased in the Middle City. The watch between the cities do not share notes. Makes life as a thief easier, yes?” Kincaid placed his hand on Sholeh’s forearm. He gave a comforting squeeze before she unleashed her fury on the man. “Adelaise, we would be happy to accompany you to the guild.” Kincaid diverted the discussion away from Sigurd. “Thank you. When we go, we won’t bring weapons. Best clothes and mouths shut. You’re witnesses on my defense and not part of the process. The guild hires cutthroats, warriors, and killers. We don’t need or want to make enemies here.” “Understood. When do we leave?” “Pack your things, put on your change of clothes, and we leave in an hour.” Sigurd didn’t move as Adelaise, Sholeh, and Kincaid rose from the table. He drank another sip of his beer as they went to the staircases. “By all that is holy, you have to get rid of him.” She waited just long enough to get out of earshot. “I helped him and told him where we were staying.” “Why?” “Because we have no options right now. I’ve failed at two schools, a guild has exiled you, and now we are off to face an inquiry on behalf of another person carrying swords. Maybe we form a company.” “That has not worked out for us yet. Not in Caesea and not on the road.” “Not fair, Sholeh.” They changed into their spare clothes, and Kincaid wisely remained silent. The guild house stood perpetual watch over a crossroads of the main thoroughfares of the Middle City. It was a fortress with a crenelated rooftop perfect for archers and muskets. Windows on the top floor were wide enough for firearms or bows to cover a wide arc. The granite blocks on each floor were cut perfectly to complicate attackers trying to scale the walls. The designers allowed for some luxuries. The bottom floor had broad windows. But the windows had interior and exterior shutters to provide a better level of protection. Given the Middle City location, this structure had not been under siege for at least a century. The windows were unadorned glass, but the metalwork was elaborate. Sholeh caught the level of mastery for each sconce, fitting, and piece of metal scrollwork. Functional and subtle. The first floor held the gathering hall. A great fire roared at one end of the room as attendants stacked logs to keep the cold at bay. An expansive wooden table stained nearly black waited with matched cushioned chairs, and smaller tables scattered near the front of the room. The rest of the hall was filled with unmatched chairs for the people who would gather to observe. People of all sizes, colors, races, and genders filled the room with the low thunder of conversation. Few noticed the arrival of the accused, and the discussions continued. Sholeh didn’t expect the range of mercenaries to show for this inquiry. Punishment in Pilaetium was usually decided in private and sometimes carried out in public. This was a show to the members and the people who would hire companies from the guild. She doubted the trial would be fair. Someone had to face judgment. Adelaise wound through groups, nodded at some supporters, and ignored the scowls from those who wished her to fail. Kincaid and Sholeh followed in her wake. “Remember, you are witnesses. Not my counsel and not a team of barristers. That won’t help me here.” They reached the front of the room and stood near the closest table facing the judgment bench. Sholeh couldn’t think of anything else to call it. “Do we join you at the table?” Kincaid asked. “No, that would make you part of my party in this discussion. You aren’t. Sit in this first row behind me so you can make your way to the front of the room when called.” Kincaid nodded, and Sholeh looked around the room. Captain Xenres pushed his way through the crowd as he focused on his table at the front. He dropped a stack of paperwork at his place and leered at Sholeh. Adelaise kept her eyes forward and pretended to study the arms and armor around the room. The voices fell quiet, and chairs scraped as people made way for the staff of inquiry. Five senior captains marched up the center of the room and took their places behind the high-backed chairs. None looked toward Adelaise. At least none looked toward her accuser. As they sat down, the visitors and members of the guild grew silent. The nervous energy of the room transitioned to shuffling feet and whispered words. Sholeh didn't like the vultures circling over the pending carcass. “Members of the guild, we gather to consider the terrible claims against one of our captains. We welcome guests from other guilds to see that justice is done quickly and fairly. Captain Xenres, you have the floor.” Sholeh expected a comprehensive opening statement from the captains sitting in judgment. Even a summary of charges or warning to the audience would have been a better sign. This inquiry was too open-ended. The gathering fell silent to catch each word. Xenres began with a description of the merchants and their contracts. He explained how he hired his regular company of sellswords and set their rates. They expected an uneventful journey until the mountains and the passes. Even groups of bandits and lawless mercenaries wouldn’t pose much trouble to the experience he brought to the expedition. “But I didn’t expect the threat to come from within.” He paused for effect among the crowd. No gasps or whispers, just silence met his theatrics. He continued, “I knew Adelaise didn’t have a full company. What I didn’t expect is that she would hire unvetted sellswords in the lands of Caesea.” Sholeh gripped Kincaid’s arm and pushed him into his seat. This wasn’t the time for a legal squabble. They couldn’t afford to lose their best ally in the city, and Kincaid couldn’t ruin this argument for them. The male captain on the far right spoke first. “Captain, why were you so worried about the members of another company? Did you review your roster with her?” Voices murmured throughout the room. “No, sir. But who she hired on would make a difference when we came into contact with enemy forces.” “Of course. But do you normally worry about this when contracts are signed?” The opening move faltered, and Xenres relented, “No, sir. But we would discover the hires were incompetent before we reached the mountains. My company became concerned that the right side of the caravan was vulnerable because Adelaise hired people that weren’t experienced enough to do their job.” “I see, continue.” “My company reached out to Captain Adelaise and her company to offer training. To help out in the nights and mornings to make sure they had the skills to work with my experienced team.” Sholeh glanced over and caught Adelaise’s eye roll. No doubt, the members at the table noticed her expression as well. “And?” “She refused. But the most dangerous times were the threats of the young man sitting behind her. The red-headed one. The ones he made against my company.” Sholeh nearly sat on Kincaid to keep him in his seat. They wouldn’t be able to shout down the lies, and they needed to let this run its course. So far, the judges didn’t appear impressed with the contrived story. She wanted to tell him, “Do not blow it.” Kincaid settled back into his seat and let the air in his lungs out in a long breath of frustration. His butt stayed in the chair. “His actions would lead to the murder of one of my company. He would even wound two others.” The female captain in the middle of the table took up the questioning. “This man fought against three of your mercenaries?” “Four of them.” “By himself?” “Yes, he did.” “And this was one of the guards you worried couldn’t hold his own in the caravan’s defense?” No one breathed as the question hung in the air. The fire cackled with the captain’s predicament. The trail of smoke up through the stone chimney marked the passage of time. “Then perhaps you should have hired him to train your company,” one of the other captains spoke. The woman in the middle let the traces of a grin cross her face. She looked into the seats behind the tables. “Master Merchant Djau, you were party to this contract. What can you say about the fight amongst the members of this guild you contracted?” Sholeh turned her body around to look at the merchant. Instead of travel clothes, he wore beautiful silks tailored in the most current fashions of the Empire. His clothing was a blend of colors designed to catch the eye and impress the viewer. “The fight forced a trial of the young man, Kincaid. In the name of discipline, we banished him from the caravan. We had to take action for the simple fact he killed another guard and wounded two others. We didn’t want to take him to the capital for punishment.” “Why not?” the leader of the captains asked. “Because I believe the young man fought in self-defense. In my years of travel and life in this world, I’ve never seen a man choose to take on four trained and armed individuals.” Captain Xenres slumped in his chair. “But that is not all?” “No, ma’am. We lost faith in your guild.” Voices rose to shouts and drowned out any other questioning. One of the captains drew her dagger and slammed her fist with the pommel down on the long table. The thunderclap ended the commotion, and the senior captains glared at the interruption. “Viewing this inquiry is a privilege, not a right. If you can’t stay silent, I will clear the room.” The audience complied, and then she continued, “Please explain.” “As the young man, Kincaid, packed his belongings, another member of Captain Adelaise’s company abandoned her duties. The blacksmith Sholeh left with the young man.” Fear jabbed straight into the middle of Sholeh’s chest with the accusation. Her breath came fast as the room turned toward her and measured her up. She chewed the inside of her lip as the words hung in the air. “What did the captain do about this violation of contract and breach of discipline?” “She made it worse. She left with the pair.” The captains stood up in their seats before the commotion could get out of control. Sholeh could not believe the words from the master merchant. They’d saved Kincaid from a horrible death, but the accusations were damning to them all. Sholeh tried to see Adelaise’s face, but the woman stared forward into the roaring fire. “Captain Adelaise, what do you have to say about the Master Merchant’s words?” “Nothing, ma’am. They are true.” The voice that was usually so confident and used to delivering commands came across as a whisper. Sholeh was impressed at the honor of her bearing and willingness to accept the price. “Then we stand in recess while the board of inquiry makes a decision.” Chairs scraped again as voices jumped back into conversations. Kincaid jumped to his feet and approached Adelaise. Sholeh was right behind him. “Adelaise, what happened?” “They brought the real charges against me. It was never about you and Sholeh.” “But our testimony—” “Won’t be asked for. Many witnesses can confess I left the caravan with the two of you. I saved the inquiry some time by admitting the truth. I left with you.” “I don’t understand—” “I don’t expect you to. I contracted you, and I broke my contract. Even the transfer of my company is a breach.” She turned away from the pair from Caesea. Her eyes were unfocused as she stared off to the back wall of the room. “We have to do something, Sholeh.” “By all that is holy, we will not. You can see how this is. We are strangers here. Guests, yes, but strangers. How could we possibly sway this board?” “Magic.” He muttered the word under his breath but with conviction. “By all that is good and right, you will not.” Sholeh’s temperature rose ten degrees. “Kill everyone in the room? Just burn the accusers down? What?” Kincaid plopped his small form down on the chairs. “No. You’re right.” “Say that again, my friend?” “You are right. I can’t believe Adelaise sacrificed everything for us.” Sholeh looked over at the woman. “That is something we still have to discover.” The board of inquiry returned a moment later. Captain Xenres grinned from ear to ear and shook hands with many members of the guild. The outcome was not in question. “Take your seats, please. The charges brought before us are serious and threaten the foundation of our guild. We take our contracts seriously, and we are paid well for the risks we take for the services we provide. When someone abandons their post and their company, we could charge with cowardice, abandonment, or desertion.” Sholeh watched Adelaise flinch with each of those words. She wouldn’t show it, but Adelaise’s soul was being cut out of her body. “Adelaise, please stand.” The woman stood on her sturdy feet and placed her hands behind her back. Her eyes focused over the heads of the members of the board. “Adelaise, you are hereby stripped of your rank of captain. You may not apply for the rank for five years. Additionally, you are on probation for six months, unable to apply for a contract or serve under one of our captains.” The room soaked in the powerful words. “Do you understand the penalties?” “I do.” With a practiced move, Adelaise reached up to the clasp of her cloak. With steady hands, she twisted the device off and let her cloak fall to the floor. She dropped the pin on the table and walked out of the room between the stunned viewers. The board of inquiry did not stop her. She wasn’t a member of the guild. Sholeh turned to watch the crowd part in front of Adelaise’s departure. No one dared a word or gesture. Sholeh’s heart broke as Adelaise walked away from her life. And then she caught an older man with the colors of one of the leading churches observing her. How did they know she would be here?",

Captain Xenres grinned from ear to ear and shook hands with many members of the guild. The outcome was not in question. “Take your seats, please. The charges brought before us are serious and threaten the foundation of our guild. We take our contracts seriously, and we are paid well for the risks we take for the services we provide. When someone abandons their post and their company, we could charge with cowardice, abandonment, or desertion.” Sholeh watched Adelaise flinch with each of those words. She wouldn’t show it, but Adelaise’s soul was being cut out of her body. “Adelaise, please stand.” The woman stood on her sturdy feet and placed her hands behind her back. Her eyes focused over the heads of the members of the board. “Adelaise, you are hereby stripped of your rank of captain. You may not apply for the rank for five years. Additionally, you are on probation for six months, unable to apply for a contract or serve under one of our captains.” The room soaked in the powerful words. “Do you understand the penalties?” “I do.” With a practiced move, Adelaise reached up to the clasp of her cloak. With steady hands, she twisted the device off and let her cloak fall to the floor. She dropped the pin on the table and walked out of the room between the stunned viewers. The board of inquiry did not stop her. She wasn’t a member of the guild. Sholeh turned to watch the crowd part in front of Adelaise’s departure. No one dared a word or gesture. Sholeh’s heart broke as Adelaise walked away from her life. And then she caught an older man with the colors of one of the leading churches observing her. How did they know she would be here?",

      "content": "Kincaid - Magic “I wasn’t sure if you would show.” Kincaid watched the young woman emerge from the alley near the inn. “I didn’t think hecaerae would hide in the shadows and wait for failed applicants.” “I’m not representing Damis.” “That’s good because I traveled from Caesea to reach these schools, and they’ve soundly rejected me. Magi or not.” “What is a magi?” “I don’t know. I haven’t been aware of my powers to understand what these titles mean.” Why did the hecaerae from these schools think magical discussions were street topics? Kincaid shook his head. “Why have a title like magi?” “It wasn’t bestowed on me like a degree. I was in prison with a person Caesea called magi. Before he died, he called me Magi Kincaid.” The white lie burned inside Kincaid’s gut, but he ignored the feeling. “Then you passed a test.” She spoke the words with certainty. Maybe she resolved something in her mind. “We should go.” “Where?” The woman reached out and grabbed Kincaid’s hand. The warmth of unfamiliarity and the urgency of the grasp sent shocks up to his elbow. She smiled at him and gave his arm a pull to get his feet in motion. After a moment, Kincaid remembered to watch where they were going. She took him through a wandering path by the merchant class' growing wealth, but they never stopped. The hecaerae had a destination in mind, and she wasn’t sharing it as they strolled down the maintained streets of the Middle City. The small road was nondescript. Without warning, she nudged him on a street without a sign, and the houses lined up in mirror images of each other. This residential district was subdued compared to many others as the owners didn’t splurge on expensive façades. This neighborhood dug into the Middle City and hung on with all its strength. Darya pulled a key from her pouch and glanced up and down the street to check for observers. Confident no one cared about the pair, she approached a plain wooden door in the middle of the adjacent houses. With a twist and click, Darya slipped inside, waited for Kincaid to follow, and clasped the door behind him. Kincaid sensed a slight rush of magic as the lanterns flickered to life on the ground floor. The entryway was narrow with the buildings leaning into each other, and the stories split with a staircase up for three levels. The upstairs wasn’t lit with magic, so Kincaid followed her into the simple dwelling. The floor creaked and buckled with their steps. Kincaid knew that he could rebuild this flooring with a few hours of work and have it silent and strong. He suspected the wizards wouldn’t ask him to do that work. The ground floor opened into a kitchen area with a stove and a common area decorated with comfortable furniture. Couches and chairs stuffed with soft cushions were haphazardly arrayed. None of the furniture matched, and Kincaid assumed it was castaway furniture accumulated over the years. Darya gestured to the chairs and went behind a counter to grab two glasses. She eased out a cork from a bottle of wine and filled the long-stemmed glasses. “I’m assuming wine is ok?” “Ok, for what?” “To drink.” “You asked me to find you at an inn. We could drink alcohol anywhere.” Kincaid longed to push his senses into this house, but the hecaerae staring at him would sense his effort immediately. “That was so we could meet. Now we need to talk.” The woman slid out from behind the counter with the two full glasses. Kincaid politely took the goblet and placed it on the table next to him. Darya eased her body into the couch next to him as a smile played across her lips. She raised her glass to her lips without taking her eyes off him. “Why did you come to the school?” She took a sip of her red wine. “To learn about magic. Why else would you go to school?” She was close enough to feel her warmth radiating out, and he tried not to fidget in the comfortable seat. “What did you notice about the hecaerae judges?” “They were uncomfortable with me as a magi.” “No, think harder.” “They didn’t appreciate how I used my magic. Not like I had a choice.” The woman tilted her head forward and smiled at the corners of her mouth. She took another sip. “Getting closer.” “I didn’t show them the power they wanted to see.” “What about the people?” “Distinguished. Experts.” “Old.” “Yes, and that too, why?” “Do you understand the price of magic?” The blast of lightning hit Kincaid’s awareness and stunned him. The woman’s smile grew, and she reached out a squeeze Kincaid’s hand. She let go and put her glass back on the table. “What is this place?” Kincaid gestured around the room. “A place of study. The kind of learning that you won’t find in a school.” Her hand slipped back into his. “Was your experience at Theurgia the same?” “Rejection, yes. But those wizards had me show some magic. They explained they wouldn’t take me because I focused on the physical elements. That wasn’t talent.” “Were they old?” “Older, yes.” “My point is the same. Why did you think you’d find answers at a school led by the ancient?” Kincaid couldn’t argue with her logic. What could old people teach him about arcane power? The curse of magic applied to everyone, but could they know about the secret of his strength? He couldn’t share that yet. “My magi sent me here as his dying wish. He wanted me to learn from a school of magic.” “We can still do that, Kincaid.” Kincaid reached over and took a sip of his wine. The red was sweeter than the dry he usually liked, but the warm rush down his throat was perfect and smooth. He cleared his mind and tried to look into his future. “I’m listening.” “You know the schools don’t practice magic. They can’t if they wish to grow old. Teachers instruct theories and concepts. Only the smallest traces of power are used to prove concepts.” “What about the ranks? The gold on the sleeves?” “Primarily awarded for theoretical pursuits and academic papers. Peer review means arguing about firmly held beliefs. The schools learned the dangers of magic in the very earliest years and limited student exposure.” “So how do I learn?” “With us.” “Us?” “There is a group of students that decided to learn more about magic. Controlled, of course. But we need to experience more about the force we can control, and we must find a way to get around the curse.” The schools and all the hecaerae didn’t know, and Kincaid couldn’t share exactly what they wanted. Trust first. And then he could make this commitment. He relaxed back into his chair. “I’m interested. Definitely interested.” “Tell me about the fight in Caesea?” “I’d rather not.” Her eyes shifted away from Kincaid and looked toward the floor. She was too eager to understand what happened. “I’d heard the stories of the destruction and loss of lives.” “Probably all true, even with some exaggeration. The fight between two wizards is terrible. The power has no bounds.” “You don’t look like you carry the scars of that fight.” There it was. This group of students was determined to discover his secret. He’d find a place among them, but they would reveal what they know about magic as well. “I fought defensively and tuned my magic to the minimum required to keep from dying. That’s why the blasts were out of control and did so much damage.” She nodded her head in agreement. Kincaid wasn’t sure she completely believed him, but his story was plausible. He doubted these hecaerae had experience with fighting other wizards. If their schools focused on theory rather than practice, they wouldn’t refute what he said. “I’d like you to meet the others.” “I think you can teach me what I need to know.” The smile returned to her young face. She was energetic and attractive. But was she attracted to him or his power? “You can stay here.” “I’d rather return and not draw attention.” “Ah, the blacksmith.” She looked away from his eyes. “When is the next time you’ll meet with the others?” “We try to meet every three days. So, we meet again tomorrow. They already agreed you could join us.” “Thank you, Darya. I can show myself out.” He left the young woman behind with her thoughts and her glasses of wine.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Church",
      "content": "Sholeh - Church “Should have kept my cloak,” Adelaise said to no one. Emotions and outbursts marked the days since the trial. Adelaise didn’t know what to do with herself. She wavered between waging a one-person war on a guild of warriors to finding herself at the bottom of a bottle. Sholeh gave Sigurd an element of grudging respect as he tried to balance the former captain’s emotions with a joke or a drinking partner. The eyes of that priest from Adelaise’s inquiry wouldn’t leave Sholeh’s mind. If the church tracked her down within the hundreds of thousands of people of the city, she couldn’t stay idle. Her friends, especially Kincaid, would be at risk. As Sigurd and Adelaise took on another round of drinking and Kincaid disappeared to discover more about the city, Sholeh decided on her only choice left. She’d go to the Inner City. Her shaking hands pulled through her few belongings. Sholeh’s bag was still empty after their caravan duty, and she had nothing appropriate to wear into the Inner City. The real choice was wearing weapons on her belt. Her hands ran along her hammers as her mind drifted. She decided. She wouldn’t carry weapons into the Inner City. She couldn’t fight what was there with steel. Sholeh didn’t bother to hide her departure from the others and just made for the door. They let her go without a word, and that would be better for them all. The walk through the city brought back memories of her youth. Back then, she didn’t pay much attention to the world around her. Focused on her life and then her escape from the city, Sholeh didn’t leave time to admire the sights. Merchants hawked their wares, workers spent their hours of labor longing for the wealth around them, and powerful men and women ignored the lives beyond their own. The games of power played at every level. The Inner City was the home of the centers of power in the Empire. No one who wanted to gain favor or influence could avoid the requirement to maintain a strong presence closest to the Emperor. Guilds and nobles clamored for attention in this city. And even churches. Sholeh wasn’t sure which church would be her destination, but she’d had a good guess. Five co-equal priests led the churches of the Empire. Sholeh suspected this was to keep the church fragmented with internal squabbles and never present a challenge to the throne. She assumed she’d have to visit all five to find what she needed. The churches' structures were impressive on a level unlike anything she’d seen traveling in other parts of the Empire and certainly in Caesea. These buildings took decades to build with an army of workers and a dedicated staff of professionals from every craft. Each new leader of their church commissioned architects to modify their power centers with the most impressive modern features. Gold and silver were common, and the mason’s work revealed the patient craft of decades of work at every church. Organized religion doled out their fortune to masters of arts at a rate that kept the Middle City prosperous. With the wealth available, churches sought the most celebrated artists from around the world. The competition kept a district of artisans employed and wealthy. The gateway to the first cathedral stood twenty feet high and was the crowning example of lavish architecture with statues, precious materials, and perfect workmanship. And this church had more than one massive set of doors. Instead, it had three locations covering the front of the building. One door was always left open as an invitation for the weary of spirit, as was the tradition. Sholeh’s spirit, however, dragged as she took each step up the polished marble. She slipped into the open door and whispered the entrance prayer under her breath. She crossed through the space before the inner door and walked within the confines of the towering cathedral. She craned her neck upwards to look at the soaring heights. Lights hung from long silver chains suspended thirty feet in the air. The ceiling was at least twenty feet above that. Artwork and sculptures of religious moments and influential leaders comforted the weary traveler and encouraged people to enter. The temple had nooks everywhere for side chapels and places of prayer. Each chapel had an elaborate altar for worship. Still, Sholeh timed her arrival well enough to avoid the prime prayer hours. As she walked the center aisle, she whispered another prayer under her breath for calm. She drove her feet forward to the sanctuary of the church. The displays of gold, master sculptor’s work, and mosaics of precious gems grew in size and value the closer she got to the altar. Sholeh whispered another silent prayer, this time asking for strength. She slid into a pew near the altar and surrendered her worries to the silence around her. Her soul longed for peace even as she doubted she’d find it here. Clergy and other church members made their way quietly up and down the aisle as Sholeh reflected. She didn’t notice one stopped until he cleared his throat. Sholeh glanced up and was surprised to see one of the priests she knew. He once worked a smaller church in the Outer City but found his way to a cathedral since Sholeh turned her back on this. Parsa slid into the pew next to her and looked up at the altar and shared her silence. After a few moments, he leaned over to catch her attention and pointed toward one of the side altars. Sholeh nodded, and the man got up with his robes brushing against the wooden pews. His sandals were silent on the marble floor as he made his way to the side chapel. Sholeh drew a breath and asked everything holy in this church to give her wisdom. She slid off to the side and glanced around to see who else was watching her. “You are fortunate I found you first, Sholeh.” His voice was low and insistent. Sholeh was afraid it would carry around the chapel. “I think it is what the holy one would want.” The man stepped back and raised an eyebrow. “You’ve come for forgiveness?” Sholeh’s fire returned in her eyes and straightened her spine. “There are many things I have done wrong in my life, and there are choices I will always regret. But none of them involve the church.” “Shame on you, Sholeh.” “I am the one who came back.” She shot the words in his face and took a half step forward. “Not here.” “You are the one who pulled me to the side. Yes, here.” “He will find out you are here.” “I expect you to tell him. And now you can deliver a message for me.” “Sholeh, please. Just see him.” Sholeh looked around the side chapel. The metal craftsmanship was worth more than her apprenticeship. As she took in the displays around the altar, the side chapel could be worth more than her shop in Caesea. Images of Kincaid flashed in her mind. His wasted body when he broke out of prison. She imagined the burdens his soul carried from the power threatening to burn him from the inside out. Adelaise’s rigid posture as she walked out of her guild smoldered within Sholeh. And even the big northerner was growing on her. Her eyes came back to the priest she had known for over six years. He’d changed. Once one of the charismatic preachers to the poor and disadvantaged, he was now in a position of power. The band at his wrist meant he was approaching the top. Perhaps he’d be in line for one of the bishops in the Empire. “No. But I want you to tell him I am fine. I don’t know how long I will be here, but I’m working for my living.” “But the guild rejected you.” The words slipped out of his mouth, and Sholeh’s jaw dropped. “I’m sorry, but tell me it isn’t true.” Sholeh collected herself and wished she had Kincaid’s magic. She’d show him and this church a thing or two about power. “By all that is holy, I will be fine. Tell him that.” “Your father wouldn’t want you to swear. Especially not in this church.” His condescending tone was enough. “Tell my father that I am still done, and I will not be staying.” She wasn’t going to keep doing this verbal sparring. Sholeh moved away from the altar and kept her eyes locked on the back of the church. He’d hear about her visit soon enough. She wasn’t waiting around for another lecture. Her soul didn’t find peace.",

Each chapel had an elaborate altar for worship. Still, Sholeh timed her arrival well enough to avoid the prime prayer hours. As she walked the center aisle, she whispered another prayer under her breath for calm. She drove her feet forward to the sanctuary of the church. The displays of gold, master sculptor’s work, and mosaics of precious gems grew in size and value the closer she got to the altar. Sholeh whispered another silent prayer, this time asking for strength. She slid into a pew near the altar and surrendered her worries to the silence around her. Her soul longed for peace even as she doubted she’d find it here. Clergy and other church members made their way quietly up and down the aisle as Sholeh reflected. She didn’t notice one stopped until he cleared his throat. Sholeh glanced up and was surprised to see one of the priests she knew. He once worked a smaller church in the Outer City but found his way to a cathedral since Sholeh turned her back on this. Parsa slid into the pew next to her and looked up at the altar and shared her silence. After a few moments, he leaned over to catch her attention and pointed toward one of the side altars. Sholeh nodded, and the man got up with his robes brushing against the wooden pews. His sandals were silent on the marble floor as he made his way to the side chapel. Sholeh drew a breath and asked everything holy in this church to give her wisdom. She slid off to the side and glanced around to see who else was watching her. “You are fortunate I found you first, Sholeh.” His voice was low and insistent. Sholeh was afraid it would carry around the chapel. “I think it is what the holy one would want.” The man stepped back and raised an eyebrow. “You’ve come for forgiveness?” Sholeh’s fire returned in her eyes and straightened her spine. “There are many things I have done wrong in my life, and there are choices I will always regret. But none of them involve the church.” “Shame on you, Sholeh.” “I am the one who came back.” She shot the words in his face and took a half step forward. “Not here.” “You are the one who pulled me to the side. Yes, here.” “He will find out you are here.” “I expect you to tell him. And now you can deliver a message for me.” “Sholeh, please. Just see him.” Sholeh looked around the side chapel. The metal craftsmanship was worth more than her apprenticeship. As she took in the displays around the altar, the side chapel could be worth more than her shop in Caesea. Images of Kincaid flashed in her mind. His wasted body when he broke out of prison. She imagined the burdens his soul carried from the power threatening to burn him from the inside out. Adelaise’s rigid posture as she walked out of her guild smoldered within Sholeh. And even the big northerner was growing on her. Her eyes came back to the priest she had known for over six years. He’d changed. Once one of the charismatic preachers to the poor and disadvantaged, he was now in a position of power. The band at his wrist meant he was approaching the top. Perhaps he’d be in line for one of the bishops in the Empire. “No. But I want you to tell him I am fine. I don’t know how long I will be here, but I’m working for my living.” “But the guild rejected you.” The words slipped out of his mouth, and Sholeh’s jaw dropped. “I’m sorry, but tell me it isn’t true.” Sholeh collected herself and wished she had Kincaid’s magic. She’d show him and this church a thing or two about power. “By all that is holy, I will be fine. Tell him that.” “Your father wouldn’t want you to swear. Especially not in this church.” His condescending tone was enough. “Tell my father that I am still done, and I will not be staying.” She wasn’t going to keep doing this verbal sparring. Sholeh moved away from the altar and kept her eyes locked on the back of the church. He’d hear about her visit soon enough. She wasn’t waiting around for another lecture. Her soul didn’t find peace.",

Having a blade nearby can come in handy in cities like this. Even in the Inner City.” Sholeh’s jaw was set, and she glanced around the open area in front of the church. “Not here.” Sholeh picked up a swift pace away from the cathedral. Adelaise followed and used her hand to steady her long blade at her hip. Whatever happened in that chapel, Sholeh was ready to get away. But her emotions distracted her, and Sholeh wasn’t paying attention to her environment. Adelaise examined the people around them, even as she maintained a full stride. At heart, she was still a mercenary captain. In places of high power, the shadows of darkness were always the deepest. She caught the flash of robes as her eyes peered into one of the alleys. Wizard’s robes. Damis? Typically, she’d investigate who had this interest in their walk, but she needed to stay close to Sholeh. Adelaise expected they would stop somewhere in the Inner City to gather their thoughts, but the blacksmith walked straight through to the Middle City without looking back.

He’s not noticing the changes in you since we’ve been here. You’re carrying a heavier weight. I don’t know everything, but I know that’s not good.” “You are right. I have a storied history with the church. It is one reason why I left this town.” “Just one, huh?” Sholeh smiled. She was genuine in her emotions even as she wrung her hands.

Now that I’m finished issuing orders, I can be a good listener.” Adelaise tried her half-smile. “My father is one of the five patriarchs of the church.” Adelaise sat in stunned silence. The contract made sense now, and the spymaster’s continued interest worried the warrior. Adelaise hoped Sholeh couldn’t decipher the emotions that flashed across her face. “I understand.” “You do not. He wanted to use me as a pawn in his games of power. He longed to be a patriarch and would do anything to get it.” Her words fell silent, and Adelaise knew she wouldn’t share more. Instead, they shared a meal together and just enjoyed the company.",

I know.” “You know nothing, Adelaise. And think clearly about what you’re getting into. You can’t afford to sever your last ties. Your probation may turn into permanent exile.” He poured into both glasses, even as Adelaise made no movement to join him. “Why bring her back here, to Pilaetium?” “I don’t owe you any answers, Adelaise. My employers have my discretion in these matters, and why you brought her is none of your business. You failed as a mercenary when you separated from that caravan.” “I paid the price for that.

      "title": "Kincaid - Return to Magic",
      "content": "Kincaid - Return to Magic “You came back.” “I need to know more.” Darya’s smile warmed Kincaid’s heart. He knew this decision was the right one. “Tonight, you’ll meet a few others. We can show you a few things you may not understand.” They slipped through the deepening darkness to the safe house, and this time Kincaid marked the way in his mind. The lights were already lit as they entered the house. Magic was everywhere tonight, and Kincaid’s soul hungered for arcane power. The flows everywhere in the room were tight and controlled, holding the magic to a minimum. Four other men and women waited on the stuffed furniture. They smiled as Darya led Kincaid into the room. “This is one of our study groups.” “Studying what the masters won’t give you?” “Exactly.” One man stood up first and offered his hand. He was still in his robes of Damis. “Bartalan.” This young hecaerae had energy in his eyes. No, a hunger. A feeling Kincaid knew all too well. As they gripped hands, Kincaid sensed the deep reserve of power within. He hadn’t been able to detect the strength of a person’s magic before. The introductions continued around the room. The group was young, full of spirit, and eager to learn more. They were also wealthy, wearing the finest materials an Empire could offer. Kincaid wondered if they were from Damis or if Theurgia found their way into this group. He’d have to wait. “What is the magic of the west?” Bartalan cut straight to the point. “I think it’s the same as everywhere else. I’m not sure what to use as a reference.” “Based on your soul, right?” one of the young ladies asked. “I wish it was otherwise. But yes.” “That’s why we stopped listening to the theories of magic around here. The elders couldn’t know that much about the practical use of magic,” Darya said. “When I was at Theurgia applying to admission, they asked me to do something else beyond the basic elements. I didn’t know what they meant, and I failed.” “What do you mean by basic elements, Kincaid?” Bartalan asked. “For me, fire, earth, air, and raw arcane power are easy to manipulate. When I fought a sorceratti in Caesea—” “Wait, you killed another wizard?” Darya asked. Her face changed to awe. Kincaid didn’t like it. “Several.” The others leaned forward to listen to his inaudible voice. “I had no choice. My life or theirs.” “You know magic can do so much more than fire and air. We use this power to manipulate everything around us.” Kincaid couldn’t tell if Bartalan was condescending or just regaining control of the meeting. “Show me.” Kincaid grabbed a goblet of wine and settled into a comfortable chair. The group relaxed and turned toward Bartalan. The young man adjusted his robes and closed his eyes. Kincaid sensed the movement of magic, and it was different from the magi’s experience. The rush always threatened to overwhelm and claim Kincaid’s soul. Bartalan started with restraint over the flow of magic. He bent it to his will. Pressure crushed Kincaid’s body. Lifting his hand became difficult. The wood of the mismatched chair creaked under his weight, and his head began to droop forward. Bartalan opened his eyes and smiled. Kincaid’s weight pushed him down, threatening to pull him through the floor. The pressure stopped. “What did you do?” “The force that holds everything to the ground, gravity, can be manipulated like fire. I had gravity increase to make it difficult for you to move. A surge of this energy could be deadly.” Kincaid looked at the others. “What else?” Darya spoke up first, “Imagination is the only limitation to magic. The forces you feel within you can guide your mind.” “The pressure on the soul is always much less when I use what is already around me. The flames on the wall or fireplace are always useful, and I can even use the air,” Kincaid said. “Yes.” Bartalan nodded eagerly. “Now you see why we want to know more than the old ones who run the school. We control the streams of power to learn more.” “But we still pay for the magic.” Kincaid looked at each one of them. Under close scrutiny, they carried the extra weight of years sacrificed in their pursuit of knowledge. Just behind their glances was the hunger for knowledge. And power. “And that is the greatest secret we hope to unlock. If we can slip past the cost of magic, then we could change the world.” Bartalan’s eyes glowed with the power of magic coursing through his veins. Kincaid deflected this discussion. “What else can you show me?” “I love working with light,” Darya said. “The energy is very low for me, and I can make things happen all around us.” An image of Darya stood behind her seat. The duplicate waved and smiled at Kincaid. Kincaid sensed the energy in the room and felt the limited flow of magic. From across the distance and in the dim light, the image looked real. “Bending light takes practice. It’s straightforward to duplicate myself and mirror my actions. But having my image stand while I’m sitting and doing independent actions takes practice.” The extra Darya disappeared in a blink. “Shadows work the same way,” one of the other male students dressed in ordinary clothes mentioned. “As the opposite of light?” “No, not the opposite at all. Shadows are a dark part of this world. They are a piece of us, and they can affect the world.” Kincaid sensed the flow of magic increase again, more than what it would take to manipulate light. The candles no longer flickered, as if they cowered from the encroaching darkness. No, the night lived. The shadows lengthened from the walls and pooled around the feet of the furniture. If Kincaid looked at them from the corner of his eyes, he sensed a substantial nature to shadows that could not be solid. Fear surged in his heart. The demonstration continued as the chairs slid across the floor as if unseen hands pulled them. The shadows dragged the chairs to new positions, and the liquid darkness formed in the seats. Kincaid fought down his urge to back away from the growing darkness. This is all they have? Laugh at them. You’ve killed wizards. Show them what you can do. The voice was everywhere in the den. Kincaid glanced at the study group members, but none looked around for the source of the booming sound. Although Bartalan didn’t break his gaze on Kincaid. The lights flickered back to life, and the shadows retreated to their lifeless reflections. Everyone breathed a collective sigh as they realized they held their breath during the demonstration. Incredible magic. “Are all of you tuned to a particular force or element?” Kincaid looked at each of the students, and he returned the stare back to Bartalan. “We have different strengths, and we certainly favor one power over others. Some, like Bartalan, can use magic across multiple elements at the same time. But the draw on power can be tough on the soul. We don’t do this very often,” Darya said. “Don’t the teachers feel the magic coming from the house? Aren’t you afraid of getting caught with this display?” “The old ones don’t channel much magic anymore. They are sensitive to the flow of magic in the classroom because we are so close. But they worry for their souls and their lives too much,” Bartalan said. “Hard to believe you can escape the notice of the hecaerae.” “Remember, we are around each other in a classroom all day. We keep the flow as small as possible as the newest wizard understands the price. But I haven’t seen anyone worry we might be practicing magic outside of the school.” Kincaid shook his head. “In Caesea, the use of magic is punishable by death. Even if you do it by accident. That’s why I was imprisoned.” “Your story keeps getting better, Kincaid,” Darya said. “But what is your power? What do you find the easiest?” Bartalan pushed harder. “I don’t know. I’ve only used magic when I’ve had to.” “Try it now.” The voice was insistent—a command. The other heads nodded in agreement. The energy among these students was positive and encouraging. He wished the soul of Magi Cormac was nearby to see this. Was this what he wanted Kincaid to find in the Empire? Did he imagine a place where people could use their skills and talents to push the edge of knowledge? But this wasn’t a school. This was a group of students hiding under cover of darkness to ply their arts with no boundaries. No supervision. They exhibited some restraint, but Kincaid wondered what would happen if peer pressure became the norm to push themselves the hardest. Peer pressure. Like right now. If he was going to learn more, he had to show something. He closed his eyes and reflected on the ways these students showed their powers. Kincaid started with restraint, closing off parts of his soul. His mind held an iron grip on his will. His heart thundered in his chest as the first wisp of magic flushed his senses. Show them. The voice was quiet, also watching what Kincaid would do. The young magi threw the voice out of his head and focused on the sense of magic. The arcane power bent to his will, and his mind leaped with joy. He pushed the wave of power in front of him and then around him. He filled the place with his new power and felt the control tighten on the thundering arcane magic. His soul buckled under the assault. He opened his eyes and saw each person in the room, frozen in place. They sat with unblinking stares and faces covered with curiosity and excitement. None moved. The lights caught Kincaid’s attention. None flickered, and none seemed to burn. The lights were constant. Kincaid examined the stream of magic, and he let his mind twist the movement. If he had to describe what he did, he pushed the flood of magic clockwise. The images of the people flowed around his fellow students. Their moment was still frozen in time, but their ghostly shapes leaped to their feet and looked with surprise at each other. They looked with awe and curiosity at Kincaid. Except, Bartalan. His ghostly image was frozen. Kincaid released the magic. A part of his soul disappeared with the flow as the exhaustion set in. Fatigue crashed around his mind as he considered what he’d done. In a second, after the magic dissipated, the students jumped to their feet. They looked around the room at each other, and then they gazed at him with awe and curiosity. All except Bartalan. He hid his expression behind a stone mask. “What did you do?” Darya’s voice was up an octave. She was animated and couldn’t keep her feet on the ground. “I felt it, all of it!” the shadowcaster said. “But I had no idea what you were doing. It was a wave of power around all of us.” Another female student said. “Not around us, in us,” the last male student said. “I don’t know myself. But I watched how each of you controlled your flow of magic and began with that. With the iron will around the flow and the limit to my soul, I found a different power that I never touched before.” Kincaid’s mind raced with possibilities. He could learn all of this, and he could learn it from this group of students. He ignored the cautionary tale in his mind. “What did you see?” Bartalan’s voice was above a growl. The room’s excitement felt the grip of the chill. “I don’t know. It was something I never felt.” “You shouldn’t come back.” Bartalan crossed his arms. The others looked at him with disgust. “Bartalan, no. We can teach each—” “Not until he tells us what he did. We can’t have a wizard here using powers that we can’t experience or understand.” His words began tumbling over themselves. His steely gaze returned to Kincaid. “I saw you all frozen for a moment. Everything froze. And then I adjusted the magic and saw ghostly shadows around you. What you would do when the arcane power left me.” Kincaid rose to the challenge. “Chronomancer,” Bartalan whispered.",

      "content": "Kincaid - Return to Magic “You came back.” “I need to know more.” Darya’s smile warmed Kincaid’s heart. He knew this decision was the right one. “Tonight, you’ll meet a few others. We can show you a few things you may not understand.” They slipped through the deepening darkness to the safe house, and this time Kincaid marked the way in his mind. The lights were already lit as they entered the house. Magic was everywhere tonight, and Kincaid’s soul hungered for arcane power. The flows everywhere in the room were tight and controlled, holding the magic to a minimum. Four other men and women waited on the stuffed furniture. They smiled as Darya led Kincaid into the room. “This is one of our study groups.” “Studying what the masters won’t give you?” “Exactly.” One man stood up first and offered his hand. He was still in his robes of Damis. “Bartalan.” This young hecaerae had energy in his eyes. No, a hunger. A feeling Kincaid knew all too well. As they gripped hands, Kincaid sensed the deep reserve of power within. He hadn’t been able to detect the strength of a person’s magic before. The introductions continued around the room. The group was young, full of spirit, and eager to learn more. They were also wealthy, wearing the finest materials an Empire could offer. Kincaid wondered if they were from Damis or if Theurgia found their way into this group. He’d have to wait. “What is the magic of the west?” Bartalan cut straight to the point. “I think it’s the same as everywhere else. I’m not sure what to use as a reference.” “Based on your soul, right?” one of the young ladies asked. “I wish it was otherwise. But yes.” “That’s why we stopped listening to the theories of magic around here. The elders couldn’t know that much about the practical use of magic,” Darya said. “When I was at Theurgia applying to admission, they asked me to do something else beyond the basic elements. I didn’t know what they meant, and I failed.” “What do you mean by basic elements, Kincaid?” Bartalan asked. “For me, fire, earth, air, and raw arcane power are easy to manipulate. When I fought a sorceratti in Caesea—” “Wait, you killed another wizard?” Darya asked. Her face changed to awe. Kincaid didn’t like it. “Several.” The others leaned forward to listen to his inaudible voice. “I had no choice. My life or theirs.” “You know magic can do so much more than fire and air. We use this power to manipulate everything around us.” Kincaid couldn’t tell if Bartalan was condescending or just regaining control of the meeting. “Show me.” Kincaid grabbed a goblet of wine and settled into a comfortable chair. The group relaxed and turned toward Bartalan. The young man adjusted his robes and closed his eyes. Kincaid sensed the movement of magic, and it was different from the magi’s experience. The rush always threatened to overwhelm and claim Kincaid’s soul. Bartalan started with restraint over the flow of magic. He bent it to his will. Pressure crushed Kincaid’s body. Lifting his hand became difficult. The wood of the mismatched chair creaked under his weight, and his head began to droop forward. Bartalan opened his eyes and smiled. Kincaid’s weight pushed him down, threatening to pull him through the floor. The pressure stopped. “What did you do?” “The force that holds everything to the ground, gravity, can be manipulated like fire. I had gravity increase to make it difficult for you to move. A surge of this energy could be deadly.” Kincaid looked at the others. “What else?” Darya spoke up first, “Imagination is the only limitation to magic. The forces you feel within you can guide your mind.” “The pressure on the soul is always much less when I use what is already around me. The flames on the wall or fireplace are always useful, and I can even use the air,” Kincaid said. “Yes.” Bartalan nodded eagerly. “Now you see why we want to know more than the old ones who run the school. We control the streams of power to learn more.” “But we still pay for the magic.” Kincaid looked at each one of them. Under close scrutiny, they carried the extra weight of years sacrificed in their pursuit of knowledge. Just behind their glances was the hunger for knowledge. And power. “And that is the greatest secret we hope to unlock. If we can slip past the cost of magic, then we could change the world.” Bartalan’s eyes glowed with the power of magic coursing through his veins. Kincaid deflected this discussion. “What else can you show me?” “I love working with light,” Darya said. “The energy is very low for me, and I can make things happen all around us.” An image of Darya stood behind her seat. The duplicate waved and smiled at Kincaid. Kincaid sensed the energy in the room and felt the limited flow of magic. From across the distance and in the dim light, the image looked real. “Bending light takes practice. It’s straightforward to duplicate myself and mirror my actions. But having my image stand while I’m sitting and doing independent actions takes practice.” The extra Darya disappeared in a blink. “Shadows work the same way,” one of the other male students dressed in ordinary clothes mentioned. “As the opposite of light?” “No, not the opposite at all. Shadows are a dark part of this world. They are a piece of us, and they can affect the world.” Kincaid sensed the flow of magic increase again, more than what it would take to manipulate light. The candles no longer flickered, as if they cowered from the encroaching darkness. No, the night lived. The shadows lengthened from the walls and pooled around the feet of the furniture. If Kincaid looked at them from the corner of his eyes, he sensed a substantial nature to shadows that could not be solid. Fear surged in his heart. The demonstration continued as the chairs slid across the floor as if unseen hands pulled them. The shadows dragged the chairs to new positions, and the liquid darkness formed in the seats. Kincaid fought down his urge to back away from the growing darkness. This is all they have? Laugh at them. You’ve killed wizards. Show them what you can do. The voice was everywhere in the den. Kincaid glanced at the study group members, but none looked around for the source of the booming sound. Although Bartalan didn’t break his gaze on Kincaid. The lights flickered back to life, and the shadows retreated to their lifeless reflections. Everyone breathed a collective sigh as they realized they held their breath during the demonstration. Incredible magic. “Are all of you tuned to a particular force or element?” Kincaid looked at each of the students, and he returned the stare back to Bartalan. “We have different strengths, and we certainly favor one power over others. Some, like Bartalan, can use magic across multiple elements at the same time. But the draw on power can be tough on the soul. We don’t do this very often,” Darya said. “Don’t the teachers feel the magic coming from the house? Aren’t you afraid of getting caught with this display?” “The old ones don’t channel much magic anymore. They are sensitive to the flow of magic in the classroom because we are so close. But they worry for their souls and their lives too much,” Bartalan said. “Hard to believe you can escape the notice of the hecaerae.” “Remember, we are around each other in a classroom all day. We keep the flow as small as possible as the newest wizard understands the price. But I haven’t seen anyone worry we might be practicing magic outside of the school.” Kincaid shook his head. “In Caesea, the use of magic is punishable by death. Even if you do it by accident. That’s why I was imprisoned.” “Your story keeps getting better, Kincaid,” Darya said. “But what is your power? What do you find the easiest?” Bartalan pushed harder. “I don’t know. I’ve only used magic when I’ve had to.” “Try it now.” The voice was insistent—a command. The other heads nodded in agreement. The energy among these students was positive and encouraging. He wished the soul of Magi Cormac was nearby to see this. Was this what he wanted Kincaid to find in the Empire? Did he imagine a place where people could use their skills and talents to push the edge of knowledge? But this wasn’t a school. This was a group of students hiding under cover of darkness to ply their arts with no boundaries. No supervision. They exhibited some restraint, but Kincaid wondered what would happen if peer pressure became the norm to push themselves the hardest. Peer pressure. Like right now. If he was going to learn more, he had to show something. He closed his eyes and reflected on the ways these students showed their powers. Kincaid started with restraint, closing off parts of his soul. His mind held an iron grip on his will. His heart thundered in his chest as the first wisp of magic flushed his senses. Show them. The voice was quiet, also watching what Kincaid would do. The young magi threw the voice out of his head and focused on the sense of magic. The arcane power bent to his will, and his mind leaped with joy. He pushed the wave of power in front of him and then around him. He filled the place with his new power and felt the control tighten on the thundering arcane magic. His soul buckled under the assault. He opened his eyes and saw each person in the room, frozen in place. They sat with unblinking stares and faces covered with curiosity and excitement. None moved. The lights caught Kincaid’s attention. None flickered, and none seemed to burn. The lights were constant. Kincaid examined the stream of magic, and he let his mind twist the movement. If he had to describe what he did, he pushed the flood of magic clockwise. The images of the people flowed around his fellow students. Their moment was still frozen in time, but their ghostly shapes leaped to their feet and looked with surprise at each other. They looked with awe and curiosity at Kincaid. Except, Bartalan. His ghostly image was frozen. Kincaid released the magic. A part of his soul disappeared with the flow as the exhaustion set in. Fatigue crashed around his mind as he considered what he’d done. In a second, after the magic dissipated, the students jumped to their feet. They looked around the room at each other, and then they gazed at him with awe and curiosity. All except Bartalan. He hid his expression behind a stone mask. “What did you do?” Darya’s voice was up an octave. She was animated and couldn’t keep her feet on the ground. “I felt it, all of it!” the shadowcaster said. “But I had no idea what you were doing. It was a wave of power around all of us.” Another female student said. “Not around us, in us,” the last male student said. “I don’t know myself. But I watched how each of you controlled your flow of magic and began with that. With the iron will around the flow and the limit to my soul, I found a different power that I never touched before.” Kincaid’s mind raced with possibilities. He could learn all of this, and he could learn it from this group of students. He ignored the cautionary tale in his mind. “What did you see?” Bartalan’s voice was above a growl. The room’s excitement felt the grip of the chill. “I don’t know. It was something I never felt.” “You shouldn’t come back.” Bartalan crossed his arms. The others looked at him with disgust. “Bartalan, no. We can teach each—” “Not until he tells us what he did. We can’t have a wizard here using powers that we can’t experience or understand.” His words began tumbling over themselves. His steely gaze returned to Kincaid. “I saw you all frozen for a moment. Everything froze. And then I adjusted the magic and saw ghostly shadows around you. What you would do when the arcane power left me.” Kincaid rose to the challenge. “Chronomancer,” Bartalan whispered.",

      "content": "Sigurd - Challenge “A lady should not be alone walking the streets, yes?” Adelaise spun toward the young northerner. Sigurd kept his hands open and away from his body. If she assessed him as a threat, he wouldn’t get his dirk clear of its sheath before she moved. Never mind his sword. He tried to disarm her with a smile. “Men who stalk mercenary warriors at night often don’t wake up.” “Stalk? What is the meaning of this work stalk? Like crops?” Adelaise relaxed her pose. At least she wasn’t ready to cut his heart out, but her eyes were slits, and her eyebrows were furrowed. Sigurd had to try harder. “Why are you following me, Sigurd?” “Because I must find work.” “By following me?” “In this group, everyone walks off to different parts of the city.” “What do you mean, everyone?” “The smith walks to the Inner City to church. The carpenter goes to schools of magic.” Sigurd paused to spit to the gutter of the road. “And you come to this place. A great place to find merchants to steal from, yes? But not for you to eat or drink.” Adelaise didn’t answer right away. She crossed her arms for a moment and then looked around the streets. “Not here.” The woman set off at a brisk pace. With Sigurd’s long legs and natural gait, he kept up with her. But he made sure he didn’t get out in front of her. He didn’t want to challenge her for leadership. They approached the Middle City gates without drawing attention. The guards noticed the giant next to the mercenary warrior but remained silent at their approach. They ducked and moved through the small door still open for night traffic. Thankfully, none made a move to challenge their passage. “Here. And you’re buying.” Sigurd noted the bar looked like every other upper-class bar in the district. Good structure, thick doors, and well-lit. This sign was faded so badly that Sigurd couldn’t make out the symbol or the name. The Bar without a Name. Sigurd took stock of quiet conversations, luxurious clothes, and rings and necklaces. He’d remember this place for the future. He had a half-grin on his face as Adelaise caught him analyzing the scene and rolled her eyes. “Perhaps I should introduce myself here, yes?” “Sure, let them know they should put all of their wealth on the table. We can cut our way out of here. How many guards can you take?” Sigurd looked around the room. “I’ll take the close two.” “Nice, and leave the lady with the other ten? What a gentleman.” “No, warrior and thief.” “Can we find a place to sit before the patrons think we will steal from all of them?” Sigurd slipped through the room and claimed a table near the wall. With private meeting areas, the booth was the best he could do. He slid the sword over his head and placed it in the booth. The thunk of the metal hitting the wooden wall caused their neighbors to turn and stare at the pair of warriors. Sigurd ignored them. He motioned for the barkeep to bring over beverages. “This is good, yes?” “Good enough. People here aren’t interested in a couple of sellswords willing to spend a few coins. We can’t talk in the Inner City without too many ears listening.” “Is that why you were there? To talk to the ears?” Her shoulders tensed, and her jaw tightened. “You ask too many questions for a northerner with a big sword.” “Only one that fits my hands right.” Adelaise sighed. “There’s so much going on, Sigurd. So much that none of us understand.” “You lost your captain job.” “I did. And I thought it was for all the wrong reasons. Sholeh and Kincaid are good people. But they are far more than they seem. I wish I could understand them.” “Ask.” “Like it’s that easy for people to tell their darkest secrets.” “Not all secrets have to be dark. Some need to be shared in the light, yes?” “You have a unique viewpoint.” Adelaise leaned back in the booth and watched the waiter place the big mugs of beer in front of them. Sigurd slipped a coin to the man and grabbed his drink. The mug looked tiny in his fist as he raised it for a toast. Adelaise rolled her eyes again and took her cup. “To secrets.” Adelaise snorted. “To secrets. May they find the light.” “I can drink to this.” Sigurd gave a long pull on his beer. Bitter and cold. Perfect for a night of talking and learning. He motioned for another. “I think Sholeh can learn to trust me, but her secrets are the darkest. And I can’t figure out Kincaid. There is far more to that man than I can understand. It was enough to get me kicked out of the caravan, and I do not understand why Sholeh followed him.” “She likes him.” “Yes, I see that. But she’s different here. Always running from her past.” “We all run from our past.” Sigurd kept his gaze on her even as he finished another third of his beer. “Some run faster than others.” “Ok, sage of the north—” “Sage? What is this word? Like wizard? Bah.” “No, a thinker.” “Better. We listen to elders in the north. The ones that live long enough have many tales to share with the young warriors.” “Then you’ll have to tell me your tale.” “Another time. It is your turn to tell the tale of your visit to the Inner City. It is I who came to you.” Adelaise turned to her beverage and took a polite sip. Her nose crinkled at the bitter brew, but she plowed forward anyway with her drink. “I’m in a tough spot, Sigurd. Even here, I don’t feel safe.” “Ah, two warriors with blades. Good beer and good cause. No place safer than with someone to watch your back.” Adelaise gave in to her humor and gave him a chuckle. He could win her over. Maybe not tonight, but she’d see that his blade was genuine. Sigurd didn’t fight for money. All he needed was a cause, and this group might give it to him. “I’m not sure how I can explain it yet. I need to think some more.” “Ah, only hurts your head, yes. Sometimes action is all that is needed. Solve problems with blade or fist.” “Not all of them. There are many places of power in this city. Each one tries to destroy the other, but they invariably do it from the shadows. Their plans are always difficult and complicated. Some take years or more, but they always plan. And they never want war. Too expensive.” “Then, not a good place for warriors who live by their swords. We need a simple life, yes?” “Yes, life has been simple before. I look forward to the time when it can be simple again.” “Maybe with Kincaid and Sholeh, yes?” “I wish it was that easy. They make things very complicated for all of us, and too many people in the city are interested in them. The church, schools of magic, and others that I’m still trying to figure out. I’m afraid they will need our blades soon.” “Then we will use them.” Sigurd reached over a patted the long blade tucked in the corner of the booth. “You know there are fights that we can’t win.” She looked at him over the mug of ale. “We should only fight when we can. And when we fight, we only win.” The next round of beers arrived. “I will listen and wait for when you need my help, Adelaise. You are not alone in your fight.” They each took a sip of their beer and tried to figure each other out. The secrets were enough to give them thoughts for the rest of the night.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Visitors",
      "content": "Sholeh - Visitors She was losing him. Kincaid snored in his soft mattress. Sholeh didn’t remember when he came back into their room last night. He was unusually silent. As she watched his chest rise and fall in a slow, even rhythm, Sholeh felt the young man was different. The city was changing him. She didn’t want to wake him, but she moved closer to the magi. If she had to guess, he looked a shade older. She chewed the inside of her lip. If he was using magic, he’d age right before her eyes. Kincaid told her the story of what happened to Vedette Atros, and she felt those thoughts creep inside her heart. He couldn’t do this to himself. Carpentry was a creative art that had once drawn her to him. She loved the chest he’d built her in what seemed like decades ago. The exquisite wood leftover from scraps yielded to a master’s precision. She remembered when she took him to the forge and crafted the metalwork to finish the chest. The bands of steel were excellent work for the junior apprentice to share with her carpentry friend. They were at a different place in their lives then. A much closer place. That warmth flooded through Sholeh’s heart again, but she pushed it away as she returned to the present. Her friend was using magic again. But if not at the schools, then where? The Empire did not outlaw magic. They did not kill off wizards. Sholeh knew how authority worked in the city; everyone loved control in the centers of power. She remembered her father discussing the vote to increase funding for the schools of magic. Competing power was better than consolidation under one ambition. Her father. His own ambition drove him to the top. Whatever it took, he would do. Her mother pushed him as she craved to live in the rare air at the height of power. He’d made it, and Sholeh left. She promised she’d never come back. And yet, here she was. She could not abandon her friend in this cesspool of unbridled ambition. Kincaid had to find what he’s looking for here, even if it meant she had to hide from her old feelings with this place. Sholeh tucked in the sheets around the sleeping magi and wished he could find the rest to restore his spirit. That is what they needed to discover here. The stairs barely creaked as she headed to the main room. The fire crackled, and embers disappeared up the chimney. Wasps of smoke obscured the room, but not enough to hide any of the people gathered here. The room was alive with workers preparing for another day. The call to work would come soon enough from the bell towers around the city. She ate a quick bite with the smallest coins they had. She’d have to talk to Kincaid tonight about their funds. Adelaise had been generous with her earnings, but that account was limited. Sholeh worried how much lighter their purses were getting with each passing day. Sholeh followed the rest of the workers out the door into the brisk morning air as bells rang from the clock towers. Sholeh turned toward the rising terrain of the Inner City. The light bounced off the white walls and golden spires and rooftops. Once upon a time, she thought this city was exquisite and held unlimited promise for anyone. “Your father heard you were in town.” A pair of men in elegant white tunics over chainmail armor waited at the first crossroad. “I would hope so. I went to his church to let him know I was in town but not available.” “He would like you to visit him.” “He is too important to come down from his high mountain to visit the poor scum in the Outer City? Even his own daughter?” “That is not what he said.” “Then you should deliver the message of what I said.” One of the knights of the church relaxed his rigid posture and approached. The jingle of his armor and the rattle of his spurs intimidated workers in the street. With furtive glances, they parted to move away from the pair. “He would like to know what he can do to help you in Pilaetium.” “That’s not why I went to the church. I wanted to see what had changed. I found my answer.” “Then you should see him.” “I saw enough.” “He doesn’t want to make life hard for you, Sholeh.” “By all that is holy, I do not believe we are on a first-name basis. You can tell him…” The man removed his helm and pulled back his chain coif from around his face. Sholeh’s words trailed off in her mind as she looked at a younger version of her father. If he didn’t have a head of black hair and no wrinkles around his eyes, she would have turned and fled from the spot. But her feet were frozen. “Sholeh, we could be on a first-name basis. Our father found a place for his son in the knights of the church.” “Our father?” The man smiled with the same condescending smirk her father showed his subordinates. Sholeh recoiled. It was too much like her father. “Yes, the patriarch is also my father. From before you were born. Before your mother came into his life.” “You mean his wife?” The man glanced around the emptying square. The other knight took up an alert stance. “Keep your voice down, Sholeh.” The command was stern but low. “Why, because I might embarrass the great patriarch with his indiscretion?” The knight clenched his mouth and clutched the pommel of his sword. He definitely had a different relationship with the patriarch than the one Sholeh left. “Enough, Sholeh. We came to invite you back to the church.” “To the church or to see my father?” “They are the same.” Sholeh shook her head. “That has been the problem all along. Patriarch might mean father, but he was never the father I needed. And when I left, my father did not look for me.” The knights wisely stayed silent as they considered her challenge. Her half-brother stepped back and gave her a half bow. Sholeh stared at him and didn’t back down. “I will give your father your message.” “I didn’t get your name.” “Kian.” “Kian, I hope we do not meet again.”",

      "content": "Sholeh - Visitors She was losing him. Kincaid snored in his soft mattress. Sholeh didn’t remember when he came back into their room last night. He was unusually silent. As she watched his chest rise and fall in a slow, even rhythm, Sholeh felt the young man was different. The city was changing him. She didn’t want to wake him, but she moved closer to the magi. If she had to guess, he looked a shade older. She chewed the inside of her lip. If he was using magic, he’d age right before her eyes. Kincaid told her the story of what happened to Vedette Atros, and she felt those thoughts creep inside her heart. He couldn’t do this to himself. Carpentry was a creative art that had once drawn her to him. She loved the chest he’d built her in what seemed like decades ago. The exquisite wood leftover from scraps yielded to a master’s precision. She remembered when she took him to the forge and crafted the metalwork to finish the chest. The bands of steel were excellent work for the junior apprentice to share with her carpentry friend. They were at a different place in their lives then. A much closer place. That warmth flooded through Sholeh’s heart again, but she pushed it away as she returned to the present. Her friend was using magic again. But if not at the schools, then where? The Empire did not outlaw magic. They did not kill off wizards. Sholeh knew how authority worked in the city; everyone loved control in the centers of power. She remembered her father discussing the vote to increase funding for the schools of magic. Competing power was better than consolidation under one ambition. Her father. His own ambition drove him to the top. Whatever it took, he would do. Her mother pushed him as she craved to live in the rare air at the height of power. He’d made it, and Sholeh left. She promised she’d never come back. And yet, here she was. She could not abandon her friend in this cesspool of unbridled ambition. Kincaid had to find what he’s looking for here, even if it meant she had to hide from her old feelings with this place. Sholeh tucked in the sheets around the sleeping magi and wished he could find the rest to restore his spirit. That is what they needed to discover here. The stairs barely creaked as she headed to the main room. The fire crackled, and embers disappeared up the chimney. Wasps of smoke obscured the room, but not enough to hide any of the people gathered here. The room was alive with workers preparing for another day. The call to work would come soon enough from the bell towers around the city. She ate a quick bite with the smallest coins they had. She’d have to talk to Kincaid tonight about their funds. Adelaise had been generous with her earnings, but that account was limited. Sholeh worried how much lighter their purses were getting with each passing day. Sholeh followed the rest of the workers out the door into the brisk morning air as bells rang from the clock towers. Sholeh turned toward the rising terrain of the Inner City. The light bounced off the white walls and golden spires and rooftops. Once upon a time, she thought this city was exquisite and held unlimited promise for anyone. “Your father heard you were in town.” A pair of men in elegant white tunics over chainmail armor waited at the first crossroad. “I would hope so. I went to his church to let him know I was in town but not available.” “He would like you to visit him.” “He is too important to come down from his high mountain to visit the poor scum in the Outer City? Even his own daughter?” “That is not what he said.” “Then you should deliver the message of what I said.” One of the knights of the church relaxed his rigid posture and approached. The jingle of his armor and the rattle of his spurs intimidated workers in the street. With furtive glances, they parted to move away from the pair. “He would like to know what he can do to help you in Pilaetium.” “That’s not why I went to the church. I wanted to see what had changed. I found my answer.” “Then you should see him.” “I saw enough.” “He doesn’t want to make life hard for you, Sholeh.” “By all that is holy, I do not believe we are on a first-name basis. You can tell him…” The man removed his helm and pulled back his chain coif from around his face. Sholeh’s words trailed off in her mind as she looked at a younger version of her father. If he didn’t have a head of black hair and no wrinkles around his eyes, she would have turned and fled from the spot. But her feet were frozen. “Sholeh, we could be on a first-name basis. Our father found a place for his son in the knights of the church.” “Our father?” The man smiled with the same condescending smirk her father showed his subordinates. Sholeh recoiled.

      "title": "Kincaid - Dark Choices",
      "content": "Kincaid - Dark Choices Sunlight trickled through the windows and poked through the drifting dust in the air. The rays pushed the particles across Kincaid’s vision. The day was already well underway, and Sholeh’s bed was neatly made. Kincaid wished away the longing in his heart. After all the challenges and the time in the caravan, he missed her. In the darkest moments of his life, she had been a light in his terrible journey. Her moods were now darker, and guilt choked him up as he reflected on his focus on his magi training. A gentle rap on the door broke him from his distant thoughts. “Yeah.” The door creaked open. “Decent?” Kincaid gave a laugh. “All the time together, and you still wonder if I am decent?” Sholeh walked in, and Kincaid’s smile dropped to concern. Her face was a storm of emotions. She had never been good at hiding her inner feelings, but now she wasn’t even trying. She collapsed on her neat bed without addressing his humor. Sholeh tore off each boot and threw them against the opposite wall with a thud. Still not satisfied, she flopped backward on her bed. “Breakfast couldn’t have been that bad.” Sholeh threw an arm over her eyes and covered her face for a moment. Kincaid watched the rise and fall of her chest. Even in her anger, she was beautiful. “Ok, so not breakfast. But breakfast company? Sigurd usually doesn’t make you feel like this.” She shook her head, but the words wouldn’t come. “Well, if it’s not Sigurd or Adelaise, I’m not sure how to help.” Sholeh pulled her arm away from her face and banged it back down on the mattress. “This town is dangerous for me, Kincaid.” Kincaid got up out of bed and pulled on his pants and shirt from his pack. He sat down on the bed next to Sholeh’s lying body, and he slipped his hand in hers. “We’ve fought wizards, challenged ruling houses, dueled nobles, and escaped from terror. We can fight whatever is here, Sholeh. You know I will do anything for you.” “We are so distant, Kincaid.” “I was thinking the same thing this morning, and that’s my fault—” “No. This city does too many things to me. So many things happened here in my past, and I would like to keep them hidden. But someone keeps digging them back up.” “Who’s doing the digging?” Sholeh turned her face away from him. “I’m putting you in danger, Kincaid. If the church finds out how close I am to you, they will use you against me.” “I’m not a member of your church. Or any church, for that matter. They’d have to work pretty hard to make that happen. Why would they want to hurt you?” “They do not wish to hurt me. They wish to bring me back.” “What about the blacksmiths?” “That is over. I will not be able to return in this city. Perhaps the Empire.” “What did you do?” Kincaid whispered those words even as he wondered if she would answer them. “I left.” “I figured as much. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have met in Caesea.” “I left after one of the blacksmiths pursued me for more than my skills.” Kincaid’s throat clenched on his next words. She never told him about her past in the city. “And?” “My father hated him. He made the smith’s life miserable, and his family suffered because of the attention he gave me.” “What did he do?” “I fled before anything serious could happen. I promised to never return to Pilaetium.” “And I brought you back here…” “I thought that time could heal old wounds. They cannot. The scars are intense, and some wounds can’t be healed. Now I am worried about you, my friend.” She turned her head and looked him in the eyes as pools of water formed in the corner of her deep brown eyes. Her black hair laid around her face. “We shouldn’t worry, Sholeh. I want to tell you about the magic I’ve found.” Sholeh sat up next to him and used the edge of her sleeve to soak up the tears before they fell down her face. She swung her legs around and leaned her head on Kincaid’s shoulder. “I thought the schools rejected you. I thought we would be done here.” “There is a group of students who study magic differently. The hecaerae have many factions here. They make the sorceratti look childish in the way they approach magic.” “The schools of magic have been strong in Pilaetium before the sorceratti emerged in Caesea. And even before Magi Cormac made his way from the Northern States.” “They have so much more knowledge of how magic works here. I can learn about my magic, Sholeh.” He couldn’t keep the excitement out of his voice. And Sholeh’s mood softened with his eager words. Kincaid loved to feel her melt as he talked about his dreams. “We can stay, Kincaid. But we must be careful.” “I found out so much about my magic here, Sholeh.” The rush of words continued despite Sholeh’s warning. Kincaid couldn’t help himself. “The way they master magic is different, and I found I can manipulate time. One of the students called me a chronomancer.” “What does that mean?” “I can change how fast or slow time moves around me. And the flow of magic is extraordinary. I can channel it differently.” Sholeh pulled her head off his shoulder and gazed into his eyes. “Kincaid, the magic is still affecting you. I can see it in your eyes, in your body, in your fatigue. The magic still takes your soul. Why must you do this?” “I’m at a different place, Sholeh. I can see and understand so much more of what magic can do for us. We can change the world.” “By all that is holy, for how long? A year? Two? Before your soul crumbles in your body, and you die?” Kincaid knew she was right. She was terribly right. His mind knew he could do so much more with magic. But his soul would bear the price of each experiment. He could transform the world until his body collapsed under the pressure. Then the realm would forget him. “But I know the secret of magic, the darkest secret.” “By all that is holy and good, Kincaid. You must not. I’ve seen the bodies you touch with that magic.” “But for the right reason—” “No. There is no reason for the darkness to walk the earth this way. Your soul will become darker than emptiness. You must not think this way. Every center of power will look for you and torture you to find the answers they seek.” “But then I can never use my magic. I will be a carpenter.” “That is an honorable trade. I remember the days we talk about our own shops and be masters of the trades. The wealth we would create with our hands and the joy we could bring so many. Probably not in Caesea, but somewhere we could choose.” “Magic changed everything.” “Only if you let it. You can still make the right choices.” Kincaid considered the wisdom of her words. In the years they had been together, she was the one who could tell him he was wrong. When she and his older sister, Liane, would gang up on him, he’d never win. His intellect was never enough to win an argument. Magic beckoned just out of reach, just beyond his consciousness. The seductive touch pulled a piece of his mind away from the moment. He imagined their lives in the inner city with a different school of magi. To challenge the hecaerae of Pilaetium. His magic. His time. He slipped his arm around Sholeh and squeezed her shoulders. She leaned her head back into him. Kincaid’s mind drifted to the challenge of his magic. Control of forces and common elements was within his grasp. Sholeh grounded him with her logic, but she didn’t understand what he could do.",

      "title": "Sigurd - Follow Up",
      "content": "Sigurd - Follow Up Sigurd gazed at the docks from the row of warehouses, and he filled his lungs with the smell of brine. Shouts echoed off the floating filth with swears only sailors would use. Life on the docks surged and ebbed with the water, the voices, and the smells. The sun made its descent behind the hills of Pilaetium, lighting fires to the opposite side of the straights. Empire fortifications dotted the bay across the straights. Signal fires winked and gestured to each other. Sunset’s beauty brought peace to the city but not to Sigurd’s heart. He’d have to walk into the warehouse behind him. The structure was wood with peeling paint and chipped timbers. The owners didn’t choose to keep up the structure, but it temporarily sheltered the items coming off the docked ships. This warehouse sheltered more. Buried within the depths was a collection of office spaces and meeting rooms. Different employers worked from the bowels of the building, shielded from the eyes of the law. A careful bribe here and there could keep the most interested customs official looking at the outer ring of the goods. Not looking further into the building was essential to their security. Sigurd recalled the first time he stepped off a ship with his weapons and his seabag. The city beckoned the young northerner with its wealth and opportunity. The underworld was more interested in his talent and his scruples. Sellswords in the Empire had to belong to the Guild. Sigurd never had the chance to demonstrate his prowess in arms before a different group pulled him in. A darker brotherhood acquired rare goods and pursued lucrative contracts. Someone had to perform jobs the Empire, the church, the magicians, and the guilds could deny. For the past few months, Sigurd was successful. In groups, he was the hired sword who could intimidate with a scowl. A draw of his long blade turned many encounters into a retreat for the opposing forces. He longed to use his bow, but an eight-foot longbow was too much to travel through the city. Tonight, he had to face his failure. Too many days had gone by, and he hadn’t found a chance to get back into the merchant’s house. They’d come looking for him soon. Success was the only standard, and those who failed on the contracts saw their life expectancy cut short. Sigurd unhooked his long blade from across his back and strapped it to his hip. If he needed the sword, he’d need a clean draw and get to work. Sigurd knew his dirk would be faster in the confines of the warehouse, but not more impressive. After loosening the weapons in their sheaths, he pushed open the side door to the warehouse. Sigurd held his hands to his sides, knowing the guards wouldn’t hesitate to pepper him with crossbow bolts if he made a sudden move. A voice came down from the rafters above him, “Proceed.” They could have killed him as he came in the door. They were under orders to let him pass. Boxes and crates lined efficient rows of marketable goods. At six feet tall, they made perfect obstacles for defense while allowing for an attack from above. These goods were also arrayed to disrupt a potential attacker. Sigurd moved through the maze at a steady pace. In the center of the building was a stone blockhouse. The masonry looked old, probably one of the first guardhouses for a much younger city. Too small for a customs house, Sigurd couldn’t figure out why anyone would build a warehouse around a house. But the cover was useful. A stout door protected the entrance to the inner chamber. Steel bands bound the wood, and steel studs deterred attackers. Arrow slits with sliding enclosures covered the advance to the door, and the defensive protections were open. Shadows flickered behind the slits as Sigurd approached. The clunk of a wooden crossbar echoed from inside. The door swung open. Instead of a pair of guards, Sigurd saw the man he hoped to see last. A short, stout man with rings on every finger grinned. Gold covered his chest in layers of necklaces, and his clothes were the most beautiful silk. He wore a thick black beard, and his brown eyes did not show mirth. “Sigurd, my friend, come, come. Yes, yes. So glad you decided to check in.” All lies. The young northerner ducked as he entered the blockhouse. Guards moved to flank him as he walked into the inner room. Lavish carpets layered the floor and made his boots squish with each step. Tapestries from the far south, paintings from the north, and silk from the east hung on every free surface. If they could figure out a way to put the valuables on the ceiling, Sigurd figured they would have already done it. “Sit, sit, my friend.” The stout man sat on cushions and leaned back against the wall. The guards accompanied them in the room, and Sigurd wasn’t pleased to see two other sentries also waiting. These men were giants. One was a northerner like Sigurd and rested his hands on the shaft of a double-bladed axe. Two looked like they were natives of the Empire, probably soldiers expelled from their legions. They favored the short stabbing swords but carried two of them, one for each hip. The last was from across the Inner Sea. He had swarthy features and three spears in his fist. These were not the odds Sigurd hoped for. Sigurd chose to stand. “If you will not sit, then a drink?” Eager hands poured from a silver flagon, and crystal red wine flowed into a golden cup encrusted with gold. The man had a strange way to show his wealth. Sigurd wasn’t impressed with the intimidation. “My friend, you should relax. We could have already killed you. Just talk, just talk.” Sigurd wondered if the four guards would share a few words. “The job did not go well.” “Yes, yes. I have heard this told throughout the markets. But much worse than not well.” Sigurd dropped his gaze to the plush carpets at his feet. “The chest was empty when I got into the room.” “You missed an important part. A crucial part. You broke down the door to the room and alerted the watch within the Inner City.” “This is true, yes.” Sigurd didn’t want to meet those eyes and drown in the venom. “I pay for discretion. I have many mouths to feed here, and I can’t afford the watch, the guard, and customs to be looking in my direction when a job goes bad. You threaten my entire family with your foolishness, my friend.” Sigurd shifted his eyes upwards. “I can try again, yes?” The man snorted. “What will you do, my friend? Fight your way into the merchant’s house. Find out he has already moved to a safe location? Tell me, tell me.” “Then I will make it up to you. I am putting together a team. People who can help.” “Yes, yes. I have heard of your blacksmith of the church. The carpenter who wants to be a wizard. The only one worth your time is the sellsword. She’s probably the only trustworthy one.” Sigurd couldn’t hide the surprise from his face. “Yes, yes. Your failure is very important to me. I wanted to make sure that you would not run when you failed. You’ve been watched, my friend. Watched carefully. All I did not know is when your sorry body would show up here.” “I am here, yes. And I can finish the job. With some work, I will find—” “What can no longer be found, yes? How will you do this?” “I can work—” “No. I think you must pay first.” The goons moved fast and tried to grab Sigurd by the shoulders. The northerner clutched one of the thugs from the Empire by the throat and gave a squeeze. With his muscles in motion, Sigurd threw the attacker against the side wall with a satisfying crunch. With that hand freed, he curled his fist and slammed it like a mallet into the next attacker. The blow pounded into flesh and gave him a deep grunt. As he raised his fist again, Sigurd’s breath exploded from his chest and left him gasping. The northerner slammed the haft of the axe into Sigurd’s stomach. Something cracked on the side of Sigurd’s head, spinning his face to the right. Blood filled his mouth with its iron taste. He couldn’t focus his eyes on the attack as another wooden blow rained down on his head. Through the ringing now in his ears, Sigurd heard, “Yes, yes. This price is good for the northerner for failure.” Blows rained down and kept Sigurd off balance. If he could focus, he’d fight back. He got a grip on an opponent. But the warriors didn’t give him a chance to regain his balance. The assault stopped, and Sigurd gasped for breath. Blood splatted on the expensive carpets. “Now, you will finish the job, Sigurd. Show them what it means to be a thief. Yes, yes. Or I will finish you. Now get him out of my sight.” Arms locked under Sigurd and carried him to the thick door. With a heave, they flung the young northerner into the warehouse. Sigurd pulled himself to his feet as his face burned from the blows. He’d make quite a sight at any bar tonight. Maybe someone would even buy him a free drink. Sigurd staggered out the exterior door. The cool sea breeze sent pins of pain across his bruised face and bleeding lip. He pulled himself up as his chest pulled and burned from the movement. One foot, one step. Sigurd straightened his posture as he moved away from the warehouse. “Quite a way to end a night, Sigurd.” He looked up at the woman in her loose red clothes. Sigurd smiled through his bloody teeth. “It only gets better from here, yes?” “Let me buy you a drink and get you cleaned up,” Adelaise said. Just what he needed.",

      "content": "Sigurd - Follow Up Sigurd gazed at the docks from the row of warehouses, and he filled his lungs with the smell of brine. Shouts echoed off the floating filth with swears only sailors would use. Life on the docks surged and ebbed with the water, the voices, and the smells. The sun made its descent behind the hills of Pilaetium, lighting fires to the opposite side of the straights. Empire fortifications dotted the bay across the straights. Signal fires winked and gestured to each other. Sunset’s beauty brought peace to the city but not to Sigurd’s heart. He’d have to walk into the warehouse behind him. The structure was wood with peeling paint and chipped timbers. The owners didn’t choose to keep up the structure, but it temporarily sheltered the items coming off the docked ships. This warehouse sheltered more. Buried within the depths was a collection of office spaces and meeting rooms. Different employers worked from the bowels of the building, shielded from the eyes of the law. A careful bribe here and there could keep the most interested customs official looking at the outer ring of the goods. Not looking further into the building was essential to their security. Sigurd recalled the first time he stepped off a ship with his weapons and his seabag. The city beckoned the young northerner with its wealth and opportunity. The underworld was more interested in his talent and his scruples. Sellswords in the Empire had to belong to the Guild. Sigurd never had the chance to demonstrate his prowess in arms before a different group pulled him in. A darker brotherhood acquired rare goods and pursued lucrative contracts. Someone had to perform jobs the Empire, the church, the magicians, and the guilds could deny. For the past few months, Sigurd was successful. In groups, he was the hired sword who could intimidate with a scowl. A draw of his long blade turned many encounters into a retreat for the opposing forces. He longed to use his bow, but an eight-foot longbow was too much to travel through the city. Tonight, he had to face his failure. Too many days had gone by, and he hadn’t found a chance to get back into the merchant’s house. They’d come looking for him soon. Success was the only standard, and those who failed on the contracts saw their life expectancy cut short. Sigurd unhooked his long blade from across his back and strapped it to his hip. If he needed the sword, he’d need a clean draw and get to work. Sigurd knew his dirk would be faster in the confines of the warehouse, but not more impressive. After loosening the weapons in their sheaths, he pushed open the side door to the warehouse. Sigurd held his hands to his sides, knowing the guards wouldn’t hesitate to pepper him with crossbow bolts if he made a sudden move. A voice came down from the rafters above him, “Proceed.” They could have killed him as he came in the door. They were under orders to let him pass. Boxes and crates lined efficient rows of marketable goods. At six feet tall, they made perfect obstacles for defense while allowing for an attack from above. These goods were also arrayed to disrupt a potential attacker. Sigurd moved through the maze at a steady pace. In the center of the building was a stone blockhouse. The masonry looked old, probably one of the first guardhouses for a much younger city. Too small for a customs house, Sigurd couldn’t figure out why anyone would build a warehouse around a house. But the cover was useful. A stout door protected the entrance to the inner chamber. Steel bands bound the wood, and steel studs deterred attackers. Arrow slits with sliding enclosures covered the advance to the door, and the defensive protections were open. Shadows flickered behind the slits as Sigurd approached. The clunk of a wooden crossbar echoed from inside. The door swung open. Instead of a pair of guards, Sigurd saw the man he hoped to see last. A short, stout man with rings on every finger grinned. Gold covered his chest in layers of necklaces, and his clothes were the most beautiful silk. He wore a thick black beard, and his brown eyes did not show mirth. “Sigurd, my friend, come, come. Yes, yes. So glad you decided to check in.” All lies. The young northerner ducked as he entered the blockhouse. Guards moved to flank him as he walked into the inner room. Lavish carpets layered the floor and made his boots squish with each step. Tapestries from the far south, paintings from the north, and silk from the east hung on every free surface. If they could figure out a way to put the valuables on the ceiling, Sigurd figured they would have already done it. “Sit, sit, my friend.” The stout man sat on cushions and leaned back against the wall. The guards accompanied them in the room, and Sigurd wasn’t pleased to see two other sentries also waiting. These men were giants. One was a northerner like Sigurd and rested his hands on the shaft of a double-bladed axe. Two looked like they were natives of the Empire, probably soldiers expelled from their legions. They favored the short stabbing swords but carried two of them, one for each hip. The last was from across the Inner Sea. He had swarthy features and three spears in his fist. These were not the odds Sigurd hoped for. Sigurd chose to stand. “If you will not sit, then a drink?” Eager hands poured from a silver flagon, and crystal red wine flowed into a golden cup encrusted with gold. The man had a strange way to show his wealth. Sigurd wasn’t impressed with the intimidation. “My friend, you should relax. We could have already killed you. Just talk, just talk.” Sigurd wondered if the four guards would share a few words. “The job did not go well.” “Yes, yes. I have heard this told throughout the markets. But much worse than not well.” Sigurd dropped his gaze to the plush carpets at his feet. “The chest was empty when I got into the room.” “You missed an important part. A crucial part. You broke down the door to the room and alerted the watch within the Inner City.” “This is true, yes.” Sigurd didn’t want to meet those eyes and drown in the venom. “I pay for discretion. I have many mouths to feed here, and I can’t afford the watch, the guard, and customs to be looking in my direction when a job goes bad. You threaten my entire family with your foolishness, my friend.” Sigurd shifted his eyes upwards. “I can try again, yes?” The man snorted. “What will you do, my friend? Fight your way into the merchant’s house. Find out he has already moved to a safe location? Tell me, tell me.” “Then I will make it up to you. I am putting together a team. People who can help.” “Yes, yes. I have heard of your blacksmith of the church. The carpenter who wants to be a wizard. The only one worth your time is the sellsword. She’s probably the only trustworthy one.” Sigurd couldn’t hide the surprise from his face. “Yes, yes. Your failure is very important to me. I wanted to make sure that you would not run when you failed. You’ve been watched, my friend. Watched carefully. All I did not know is when your sorry body would show up here.” “I am here, yes. And I can finish the job. With some work, I will find—” “What can no longer be found, yes? How will you do this?” “I can work—” “No. I think you must pay first.” The goons moved fast and tried to grab Sigurd by the shoulders. The northerner clutched one of the thugs from the Empire by the throat and gave a squeeze. With his muscles in motion, Sigurd threw the attacker against the side wall with a satisfying crunch.

      "title": "Bartalan - Regrets",
      "content": "Bartalan - Regrets “You made a disastrous choice rejecting the magi.” The quill stopped scratching on the paper as the hecaerae looked up from his desk. He stoppered the ink bottle, laid aside his writing tool, and folded his hands in front of him. “Explain yourself.” Bartalan ignored the rumble of a gathering storm and pressed, “Yes, the man can summon magic.” “We know that, Bartalan. But not at this school.” “We should reconsider.” “And how do you draw this conclusion?” “I’ve talked to him.” An eyebrow went up as the scowl deepened. Students could speak to anyone in Pilaetium and, on occasion, even discussed magical theory with members of other schools. The goal of knowledge was to continue learning, even from some different sources. However, challenging a decision on this level was new terrain, even for Bartalan. “He made an emotional plea to enter the school, and we rejected him.” The most experienced hecaerae in the school folded his hands in front of him. Discussion over. “But there is more to his story.” Bartalan wrung his hands behind his back. “Theurgia rejected him before he came to us. We were his second choice.” Bartalan pressed with this fragment of information. “Is that why you rejected him? Because we were a second choice?” “Why are you questioning this decision, Bartalan?” The words were above a whisper now. Bartalan had to get to the point before the master stopped listening. “Because you wonder if I’m right.” The grand master’s face didn’t crack. Bartalan’s heart skipped a beat as he plunged dangerously close to insubordination. “I allowed this meeting because you are a promising student. Now I question what you have learned from our lessons.” “More than a student at the first rank. And that’s why I came to you instead of asking for a board to reconsider. You have knowledge and experience with so many students and interaction with other schools.” If the frontal attack wasn’t working. Bartalan tried an appeal to ego. The hecaerae walked the halls of power in the Empire, and only the patriarchs and the Emperor didn’t tremble. In the heart of their administration, the hecaerae could be unassailable. “What have you learned that would change my mind?” The master’s face still hadn’t moved, and his body position was rigid. “The immigrant, Kincaid, can learn how we teach magic. He can do more than use the raw power to destroy and attack. Instead, he can control the flow of power.” “And how would you know about this new method of control?” Bartalan worked his mouth, but the words stuck in his lungs. Ice formed in his veins and pumped to his legs. The Empire forbid the schools to teach magic outside of the confines of the curriculum. They made this agreement with the Emperor as citizens appeared with the ability to wield arcane might, and the peace had been stable for that time. The Empire expected the hecaerae to use magic in defense of the Empire, and the spring military campaigns would draft wizards to the cause. But if Bartalan admitted to experimenting with an immigrant, the disciplinary board would be the least of his worries. “I can sense the powers and the flow of magic.” His voice croaked as he choked on defeat. “You are one of the strongest students to walk the hall of Damis, Bartalan. Every instructor sees your potential. I don’t doubt you can sense the flows of magic, even at a distance.” The warning in the voice was clear and firm. He wouldn’t get another one. “Sir, if you could understand magic beyond what we study. If you knew we could learn more and advance our cause. Would you take it?” The elderly hecaerae sighed and placed his palms on the table. He used them for leverage to lift his body out of his comfortable seat. Bartalan sensed the subtle flow of magic to give the old man a touch of strength and add to his presence in the room. “There are many reasons why we control magic the way we do. In fact, there are reasons why Theurgia and Damis view magic differently. We teach the subjects and demonstrate the limits of magic in a different way. But for a reason. Magic is a force that can leap out of control and claim lives with an uncultured touch. The wizard’s life is always in the balance. Always. We all respect that. Do you?” Bartalan pushed his iron discipline to contact the arcane plane. The trickle of might flowed into his heart and filled his mind with power. He saw the deep glow around the master as surely as the master observed the ring of power around him. See. The old one is afraid of what you can do. Show him. The voice rattled inside Bartalan’s head and confused his purpose. No, he wouldn’t show the depths of his power. Magic pushed at his control and longed to surge into his soul. Bartalan fought and won against the flood from beyond his consciousness. “I do. The power feels infinite. Control must be absolute.” Especially with the voice in his head. “Then why must you press with the magi?” “Because I think he has knowledge we need. We didn’t give him to explain the differences in being a magi. I think that is a mistake.” “You know something, Bartalan. I know you do. But this conversation is already dangerous.” Magic flared at the edge of the grand master’s words. His control was tight and focused. “I am sorry, grand master. I wish to learn more, and I want to do it within the confines of the school. I thought we should invite him back.” “I will be blunt, Bartalan. The magi, Kincaid, is uncultured. Undisciplined. Dangerous. To all of us.” “I understand your position.” He teeters on the edge of age and fading into irrelevance. The force of magic is yours. Bartalan shook his head and drove the voice into a corner of his mind. With a push of his will, the magic closed off. He sensed the grand master did the same. “Bartalan, leave the magi alone. No good will come to you or your position if you continue on this dark road. We need you here at this school, and we want you to stay. Do not make us regret that decision.” Bartalan already regretted many of the decisions of the ruling body of the school. His list grew by the day for the offenses against his agenda. This was a significant mark Damis would one day answer. One day. Not today. He bowed from the waist to the grand master and waited for the old one to settle his weight back into the chair. The ancient hecaerae didn’t make the chair creek with his feather weight. As the quill came up, Bartalan pulled his body upright and left the room. Not today. Soon.",

      "title": "Kincaid - New Lessons",
      "content": "Kincaid - New Lessons “You have so much to teach us, Kincaid,” Darya said. “I don’t. You’ve spent years at school and practiced magic with someone to guide and teach you. I’ve been a wizard for a few months. And only because I was fighting for my life.” Kincaid and Darya walked through the streets in the afternoon. Their pace was slow, enjoying the journey rather than racing to the destination. Her nearby warmth distracted his thoughts even as he struggled with a sense of belonging with the covert group of students. They’d already taught him more than he expected, and Darya’s outreach warmed his lonely soul. “And that is an experience none of us have. Our schools provide magical force for the Empire. When the military starts its campaigns, the schools draft hecaerae to accompany the legions.” “Then you can learn those lessons from the returning wizards.” Darya’s brown eyes captured his attention as they softened. He could get lost in their gaze. “They don’t return. In my time at the school, I haven’t seen one come back to Pilaetium.” “The curse of magic.” Kincaid nodded his understanding. He watched a sorceratti destroy herself with her magic. If a wizard lost control over arcane power, it was fatal. “Not a curse, Kincaid. This isn’t something we can solve with a prayer and an offering to the church. The school has a class on the price of magic. The scrolls and books we read date back to the earliest researchers and practitioners of magic. It is just a fact. Like the sun comes up in the east and sets in the west. Beyond change.” Not beyond change, Kincaid thought. He could pay the price with other souls. If Sholeh were here, she’d remind him the price was the same. Someone paid. “Why tell me this?” “Because you aren’t a student at the school, and your thoughts are dark and heavy.” Kincaid glanced over at his companion. “One of your powers is to read minds?” Her smile was broad and genuine. Attractive even. “You’d feel it if I was channeling energy. You aren’t paying attention to everything we’re talking about.” “I just don’t understand what I can teach you.” Their pace took them through the emptying streets as the day came to a close. Servants relinquished their tasks and returned to their homes and families. Shadows claimed the roads in the clutches of gathering darkness, even as the street lights pushed back the relentless grip with globes of light. Kincaid and Darya stepped from light to dark with sure strides. “You know more because classes and lectures don’t bind your thinking. You only have practical knowledge of magic.” Darya looked up to him. Those eyes were wide open, drawing him in with her longing. Her words held the edge of regret. “But you showed me more than I could understand the first night. You have so much more power at your fingertips than even the most powerful sorceratti in Caesea.” “Do you think we could fight and win against the sorceratti of Caesea?” Kincaid took his eyes off his companion and focused on the paved roads of the capital. The roads were smooth except for the grooves wagons laden with goods left in their passing. Masons and stone cutters kept the city streets in good order, and the Empire was always about maintaining order. Magic against magic was chaos—power without bounds. Kincaid imagined the destruction of the Inner City if a few sorceratti fought against one of the schools. The elaborate stone structures and displays of wealth would be blasted chunks of rocks and drifting dust. Arcane power ignored wealth. “There is no winning with a fight among wizards. Only destruction.” He whispered his words, already convinced of their truth. The evening breeze off the straights took the words away. Darya pressed in close to his chest. “See, you’ve already taught me more than we knew.” The gathering of students was small this evening. Only four this night, although Bartalan was one of them. His set jaw and rigid stance gave away his emotions. Kincaid didn’t want to cross him tonight. But those eyes followed his every move. The students helped themselves to pitchers of wine and relaxed for a few moments. It reminded Kincaid of an enjoyable evening meal with Sholeh, Adelaise, and Sigurd. But this group was distinct. They were like him and accepted the magic he could use without question. None judged him for what he could do. “Kincaid told me about fights among wizards,” Darya said. “Oh, please do tell, magi.” Bartalan would be argumentative tonight. Kincaid glanced at the others and saw their displeasure with their fellow student’s attitude. Accepting his fate, Kincaid resigned himself to confrontation. At least Darya was here. “I only mentioned that there are no winners in a fight with wizards. Only destruction.” “And yet, by your tales, you stand among us. Victor over numerous wizards.” The gaze melted Kincaid’s resolve, right where he stood. “You’ve certainly heard the stories of Caesea’s destruction. The fight destroyed houses, shops, and an entire block.” Kincaid’s fists curled to iron grips as his words spat from the corner of his mouth. Destruction and death raged in his mind. He pushed them aside. “Destruction, indeed. And the magi emerged from the rubble.” “What do you want, Bartalan?” The others in the room recoiled from the men facing off against each other. If either drew magic now, they’d find out exactly what happened when wizards collided. Magic hungered for a touch. From any of them. “I want the real story. The truth. No wizard can walk into Pilaetium claiming that they defeated other wizards.” “I don’t care if you believe me.” “But I do, magi. I do indeed. The stories of your destruction made their way to the city, and we’ll keep hearing about it for some time. In fact, I expect the Emperor to reach out to Damis and Theurgia for an inquiry. If a fight of wizards can do so much damage in Caesea, what would happen in Pilaetium? Or any other part of the Empire.” The other students held their breath and glanced toward each other. As the reports filtered their way through the bureaucracy, the Emperor would learn what happened in Caesea. And then the intelligence services would find out what the red-haired immigrant knew. He was in their midst. “That isn’t why I’m here.” “You want to learn more about magic. Got it. The schools turned you away because you are beyond what they can handle. The powers of the Empire won’t allow it.” “That’s not fair, Bartalan,” Darya said. Bartalan silenced her with a look. The others in the room didn’t matter. “They’ll find you in the slums, Kincaid.” “Then teach me, Bartalan. Teach me what I asked to know.” “But you know more than all of us, magi.” “What are you are talking about?” Bartalan looked toward the students staring at the standoff between the pair of wizards. He brought his gaze back to Kincaid and took a step forward. The young magi reached out with his mind and crafted his willpower to clutch magic from the arcane plane. Magic jumped to his call and rushed into the open channel into Kincaid’s soul. With the power already begging for release, he plied the twist on magic. The images around the room barely changed. Each student stood motionless and observed the magic energy humming between them. In only a moment, Bartalan would be flush with his source of power. But he wouldn’t move closer. Bartalan’s grasp for power flooded Kincaid’s senses. He carried the same touch of control on magic and didn’t create a defensive shield or draw enough power for an attack. Kincaid closed off his flow and didn’t move. “As you can see, you already know more than I do. I only used magic the way you taught me on my last visit. I still want to learn more.” Fatigue crippled Kincaid’s body. He wanted to sit and let his eyes close even as his body ached. Sholeh would know he was practicing magic. Bartalan returned to his seat and lowered his body into one of the chairs. He didn’t take his eyes off Kincaid as he walked over to a couch and slumped into the cushioned embrace. The air in the room warmed as the other students relaxed. None of them wanted to talk about magic now. Instead, they discussed plans for the future, new opportunities within the school, and favorite teachers. To Kincaid, these must be the topics wealthy students discussed in their elite schools. He had nothing to add to the discussion. If he continued this trend of exploration with his power, he needed them to share more than school gossip. He could never share his darkest secret of magic with them.",

      "content": "Kincaid - New Lessons “You have so much to teach us, Kincaid,” Darya said. “I don’t. You’ve spent years at school and practiced magic with someone to guide and teach you. I’ve been a wizard for a few months. And only because I was fighting for my life.” Kincaid and Darya walked through the streets in the afternoon. Their pace was slow, enjoying the journey rather than racing to the destination. Her nearby warmth distracted his thoughts even as he struggled with a sense of belonging with the covert group of students. They’d already taught him more than he expected, and Darya’s outreach warmed his lonely soul. “And that is an experience none of us have. Our schools provide magical force for the Empire. When the military starts its campaigns, the schools draft hecaerae to accompany the legions.” “Then you can learn those lessons from the returning wizards.” Darya’s brown eyes captured his attention as they softened. He could get lost in their gaze. “They don’t return. In my time at the school, I haven’t seen one come back to Pilaetium.” “The curse of magic.” Kincaid nodded his understanding. He watched a sorceratti destroy herself with her magic. If a wizard lost control over arcane power, it was fatal. “Not a curse, Kincaid. This isn’t something we can solve with a prayer and an offering to the church. The school has a class on the price of magic. The scrolls and books we read date back to the earliest researchers and practitioners of magic. It is just a fact. Like the sun comes up in the east and sets in the west. Beyond change.” Not beyond change, Kincaid thought. He could pay the price with other souls. If Sholeh were here, she’d remind him the price was the same. Someone paid. “Why tell me this?” “Because you aren’t a student at the school, and your thoughts are dark and heavy.” Kincaid glanced over at his companion. “One of your powers is to read minds?” Her smile was broad and genuine. Attractive even. “You’d feel it if I was channeling energy. You aren’t paying attention to everything we’re talking about.” “I just don’t understand what I can teach you.” Their pace took them through the emptying streets as the day came to a close. Servants relinquished their tasks and returned to their homes and families. Shadows claimed the roads in the clutches of gathering darkness, even as the street lights pushed back the relentless grip with globes of light. Kincaid and Darya stepped from light to dark with sure strides. “You know more because classes and lectures don’t bind your thinking. You only have practical knowledge of magic.” Darya looked up to him. Those eyes were wide open, drawing him in with her longing. Her words held the edge of regret. “But you showed me more than I could understand the first night. You have so much more power at your fingertips than even the most powerful sorceratti in Caesea.” “Do you think we could fight and win against the sorceratti of Caesea?” Kincaid took his eyes off his companion and focused on the paved roads of the capital. The roads were smooth except for the grooves wagons laden with goods left in their passing. Masons and stone cutters kept the city streets in good order, and the Empire was always about maintaining order. Magic against magic was chaos—power without bounds. Kincaid imagined the destruction of the Inner City if a few sorceratti fought against one of the schools. The elaborate stone structures and displays of wealth would be blasted chunks of rocks and drifting dust. Arcane power ignored wealth. “There is no winning with a fight among wizards. Only destruction.” He whispered his words, already convinced of their truth. The evening breeze off the straights took the words away. Darya pressed in close to his chest. “See, you’ve already taught me more than we knew.” The gathering of students was small this evening. Only four this night, although Bartalan was one of them. His set jaw and rigid stance gave away his emotions. Kincaid didn’t want to cross him tonight. But those eyes followed his every move. The students helped themselves to pitchers of wine and relaxed for a few moments. It reminded Kincaid of an enjoyable evening meal with Sholeh, Adelaise, and Sigurd. But this group was distinct. They were like him and accepted the magic he could use without question. None judged him for what he could do. “Kincaid told me about fights among wizards,” Darya said. “Oh, please do tell, magi.” Bartalan would be argumentative tonight. Kincaid glanced at the others and saw their displeasure with their fellow student’s attitude. Accepting his fate, Kincaid resigned himself to confrontation. At least Darya was here. “I only mentioned that there are no winners in a fight with wizards. Only destruction.” “And yet, by your tales, you stand among us. Victor over numerous wizards.” The gaze melted Kincaid’s resolve, right where he stood. “You’ve certainly heard the stories of Caesea’s destruction. The fight destroyed houses, shops, and an entire block.” Kincaid’s fists curled to iron grips as his words spat from the corner of his mouth. Destruction and death raged in his mind. He pushed them aside. “Destruction, indeed. And the magi emerged from the rubble.” “What do you want, Bartalan?” The others in the room recoiled from the men facing off against each other. If either drew magic now, they’d find out exactly what happened when wizards collided. Magic hungered for a touch. From any of them. “I want the real story. The truth. No wizard can walk into Pilaetium claiming that they defeated other wizards.” “I don’t care if you believe me.” “But I do, magi. I do indeed. The stories of your destruction made their way to the city, and we’ll keep hearing about it for some time. In fact, I expect the Emperor to reach out to Damis and Theurgia for an inquiry. If a fight of wizards can do so much damage in Caesea, what would happen in Pilaetium? Or any other part of the Empire.” The other students held their breath and glanced toward each other.

      "content": "Kincaid - Next Steps “She worries about you.” Kincaid jumped and spun toward the alley’s shadows. Magic clawed across the mental gap between arcane and physical, begging for access. He ignored the arcane fingers reaching for his soul. It would be there if he needed it, but he couldn’t handle more burdens tonight. He picked out Adelaise as she emerged from pools of darkness. The weapons at her hips were giveaways for the former mercenary captain. She didn’t move closer after Kincaid recognized who it was. But Adelaise’s eyes focused on Kincaid’s companion. Darya twisted her hands and looked away under the scrutiny. Kincaid’s heart leaped in his chest, enough to make his cheeks red. Darya didn’t deserve to be treated like this. Adelaise couldn’t judge him. “I know she does. I’ve known it for a long time.” “Kincaid, maybe I should—” “No, hold on. Adelaise, what do you want?” “Only to talk. I’m not sure what else she wants, though.” The accusation hit like a crossbow bolt. Darya’s flushed to a deep red face, and her eyes fixated on the ground. “Kincaid, I’ll see you later on.” She held up her hand to cut off another protest. Kincaid knew she was right this time. He had to deal with this line of questioning without her around. “I’ll let you know when we have the next meeting set up. Ok? Bye.” The young magi watched the Damithian hecaerae walk away even as he realized he didn’t know where she lived within the city. His gaze lingered before he turned back to Adelaise. “What do you see in her?” Adelaise stood with her feet apart and arms crossed across her chest. She raised her right eyebrow as she waited. “Someone I can’t be. Someone I won’t be.” “Interesting answer. Let’s go for a walk.” Adelaise came up to him and placed her hand on Kincaid’s elbow for a nudge. “We can’t talk around here.” No point in resisting. It can only get worse, Kincaid thought. Adelaise led him away from the student house, and as he matched her stride, she released his elbow and walked by his side. “Besides, we can’t afford food around here. Had anything to eat today?” “Not much.” “Your rich friends didn’t spare you a coin or buy you dinner? Shame.” “What do you know about my friends?” “Only what I saw after I followed you here. Seems the men around me get in trouble frequently. Not unlike being a mercenary captain.” “You followed me? Why?” Kincaid stopped. The pair of guards operating the small door at the gate to the Middle City watched with amusement as the young man and woman tried not to raise their voices. “Not here.” She glanced toward the sentries at the gate. “Why not here? You’ll follow me anywhere else.” “Check your emotions. This isn’t the place. Don’t make me drag you out of here.” “You couldn’t,” Kincaid muttered those words under his breath. She really couldn’t. One surge of magic and she’d regret this confrontation for life. But then what? Kill one of his only allies? Instead, he followed her through the door and gave the guards a knowing smile. They chuckled and gestured for him to follow. They kept their pace up through the Middle City. Kincaid’s mind was flush with emotion, and he ignored the sights of the wealth. The awkwardness of following Adelaise grew as she didn’t offer more conversation or reveal their destination. Exhaustion clutched Kincaid’s bones and weighted his legs with the burden of his conscience. The lack of food and brisk march through the city didn’t help. Adelaise proved her point, and the further away he moved from the wizards, his mind cleared of the conflicting emotions pumping through his heart. By the Outer City, their pace slowed. Adelaise was alert as she took in the crowds milling around the streets and hanging near bars and inns. Finding the one she was interested in, they stepped onto the wooden porch. Kincaid glanced at the sign of the inn, The Wooden Cudgel. Strange name for a traveler’s inn in the Outer City. The patrons were quiet, focused on the conversations with the members of their tables. No booths graced the walls in this place. Servers worked the floor with the committed purpose to keep plates and mugs full, and unlike many bars in the Outer City, the patrons left them alone to do their work. “Adelaise, the wayward mercenary, she comes home to us.” The barkeep greeted them from behind her station and the stained bar. The woman wore a patch, a no-kidding patch, over one eye, as a white puckered scar ran from her hairline to her jaw. The wound crippled the half-smile. She moved a pair of mugs with a single hand, moving fluidly without having a left hand. “Beautiful as ever, Gechina.” Adelaise’s tone was light and cheery. She went over to the bar, stood on her tiptoes, and hugged the barkeep. “We should talk, Adelaise.” Adelaise nodded as she scooped up the drinks from the table. “And don’t you think you stroll back into town and start a tab here. Who’s the redhead?” “A friend. Needs some mentoring.” Gechina looked Kincaid up and down. “Sure he’s worth it?” Adelaise gave a theatric sigh and glanced his way. “Think so. He cost me my captaincy. I hope my decision was right all along with him.” Kincaid winced and tried a disarming smile to the women examining him. Adelaise had control over his next meal, and he owed her his entire livelihood. They looked through the bar to find an empty table. Without hesitation, Adelaise walked across the room and sat down. She motioned for Kincaid to follow. “I needed to talk in a place where I can trust people.” “Even after you lost your captaincy? You’re on probation.” “People here don’t worry about rank, Kincaid. They don’t care about position. Every one of them remembers how someone else fought at their side and gave a sacrifice. Look at Gechina. One of the finest fighters in the Empire, and an immigrant at that. She can still tear you to pieces with a blade in her right hand. She was my first captain.” Kincaid nodded. The beer here was at the standard of the Inner City. Strong, clear, and the perfect level of bitterness. But she charged the prices of the Outer City. A good place indeed. Adelaise gestured around the room and continued. “Different than your little house in the Inner City.” “Why does that bother you?” “It should bother you.” “Why?” “Because Sholeh worries about you every day. She’s struggling to figure out what day labor job she can find to support you. Before long, she’ll attempt to work at a forge, and that will get her exiled. Sigurd is getting into trouble in the town, and I’m trying to figure out how we finish paying the bills. We can’t live in Pilaetium for free.” She stabbed with her finger to punctuated each sentence. Kincaid shrunk smaller in his seat with each blow. Every word was correct. “What’s going on?” Kincaid decided to trust her. “We came to the Empire for the schools of magic.” “I got that much. We spent a lot of time together on the caravan, and I understand your passion.” “Both rejected me.” The sting still hurt as the words tumbled out of his mouth. “So, what’s with the house?” “There are students who explore where schools don’t teach. Instead of academics, they push the edge of their powers.” Adelaise put her mug on the table and released the handle from her clutches. Her lips clenched into a thin line. “You killed Xenres’ man with magic.” “No, not with magic. But when the four attacked me, I used what I had. Magic kept me alive.” “You’re here because you are a wizard.” Kincaid nodded and took a drink. “You trust the people around here?” “With my life, Kincaid. And magic isn’t illegal in Pilaetium. Just unwise. What are they teaching you?” “I’ve only been able to use magic for a few months. The power available to me is incredible. The destruction of the city…” He watched her expression return to disbelief and then transition to awe. “Guess I didn’t need to hire a company, only you.” “And Sholeh. We both needed to leave.” “Fair. But if this group is spending so much time exploring magic, why bring you into their circle of trust?” “I don’t think they trust me. Well, their leader certainly doesn’t.” “Do you trust him?” “No.” Kincaid shook his head. “They have years of training with these experienced tutors. I’m an inexperienced hack.” “Destroying a city isn’t an accident. You have incredible power, Kincaid. But they have your interests at heart? Keeping you off the wrong path?” “I don’t know. But I do know I don’t have any other choices. How’s Sholeh?” “You should ask her.” Kincaid dropped his head toward his mug. He knew he should. He’d be dead months ago if she hadn’t helped him. “She’s fine, Kincaid. Just worried about you. Concerned for the future, like the rest of us. And you aren’t talking.” “I understand, Adelaise. I’ve got to do a better job with this, but the wizards…” “Offer everything you want. Fill the hole inside of you. I felt the same way when I practiced with a sword. The blade became part of me, and when I began with my first company, I discovered my place in the world.” She looked down at the half-empty mug. “Well, I did.” Kincaid finished his beer and pushed the mug to the center of the table. Before he could start his next sentence, a server scooped up the empty and replaced it with a full one. Adelaise smiled at him. “One of the perks of this bar. No patron goes thirsty. Don’t worry; we can afford this one.” “Looks like I’ve got some work to do to clear this up.” “You do. But what are you going to do with the wizards?” “The hecaerae? I must continue somewhere. We came to Pilaetium for me to explore my magic, and this might be my only chance.” “Be careful, Kincaid. Let us know when you have these meetings so we can be ready.” “Ready for what?” “I don’t trust what’s going on in this city. Too many people are playing games with their positions. It’s easy to get caught up in the webs of power. Your friends are more than they seem.” “I don’t doubt that. All wizards are more than what they seem. But I need them, for now. And I have to figure out a way to make our ends meet with bills. We’re all out of jobs and removed from our guilds. But this is the one thing we came to do.” Adelaise leaned back in her chair. Kincaid couldn’t read her face this time.",

The blade became part of me, and when I began with my first company, I discovered my place in the world.” She looked down at the half-empty mug. “Well, I did.” Kincaid finished his beer and pushed the mug to the center of the table. Before he could start his next sentence, a server scooped up the empty and replaced it with a full one. Adelaise smiled at him. “One of the perks of this bar. No patron goes thirsty. Don’t worry; we can afford this one.” “Looks like I’ve got some work to do to clear this up.” “You do. But what are you going to do with the wizards?” “The hecaerae? I must continue somewhere. We came to Pilaetium for me to explore my magic, and this might be my only chance.” “Be careful, Kincaid. Let us know when you have these meetings so we can be ready.” “Ready for what?” “I don’t trust what’s going on in this city. Too many people are playing games with their positions. It’s easy to get caught up in the webs of power. Your friends are more than they seem.” “I don’t doubt that. All wizards are more than what they seem. But I need them, for now. And I have to figure out a way to make our ends meet with bills. We’re all out of jobs and removed from our guilds. But this is the one thing we came to do.” Adelaise leaned back in her chair. Kincaid couldn’t read her face this time.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Torn",
      "content": "Adelaise - Torn Kincaid’s information placed the pieces of the puzzle together. From the caravan to Sholeh’s protection, this made sense. She watched as Kincaid picked his way through the stragglers still at the bar. He was steady on his feet, and Adelaise had no concerns he’d make his way back to their inn. The young man had the light step of a clean conscience. Adelaise carried a heavy burden on her soul. She twisted the mug on the surface of the table and traced her fingers on the water rings. The fire in the middle of the inn burned to glowing embers. Adelaise couldn’t let go. “Must be one of those tough decisions.” Adelaise chuckled and gestured for the owner, Gechina, to sit down at the table. Gechina took one look around the bar and made sure the remaining patrons were set, and she settled her weight into the seat. “If I had to guess, your honor is conflicting with your contract. You’re a rare captain that still behaves honorably.” “Former captain. Feelings make this more complicated.” She pulled her mug onto her lap and leaned back from the table. Her sigh was louder than she intended. “People trust us to get things done.” “That’s why you are one of the best, Adelaise. You go forward to do the right thing, even if it stinks to the high heavens.” “Then why is every choice the lesser of the evils? Why don’t I get the easy choices among the pleasant courses of action?” Gechina fixed her single eye on the ex-mercenary captain and leaned into the table. “Because you are the best there is. People who can make easy decisions are everywhere. The ones who can pick through the toughest jobs to find success in the land of the impossible… well, I only know one of those.” “Command is easier when you are on the field of battle. The consequences are there in front of you. Steel drawn, skill on skill, the flames of combat. Live or die. Fates have it all.” “But that’s not where the battle is won or lost, Adelaise. You know that better than anyone. Training, leadership, and command climate decide battles. Victory goes to the leader who pits their strengths against the opponent’s weakness.” “I wish this was a battle.” “I think it’s one for your soul.” Adelaise returned the gaze and placed the empty mug back on the table. “It is, and the cost will be high. No matter which way I pick.” “You remember what I told you: the more important the decision, the more time you should take to get it right.” “But what if there is no right, Gechina? What if there are only wrong decisions and bad consequences?” “That doesn’t change the importance of your decision. But the agony you are carrying tonight, this is important. No doubt in my mind. So take your time, and don’t mess this one up.” “Thank you, Gechina.” “Don’t forget to pay your tab on the way out.” Adelaise took back to the streets and let the night air embrace her feelings. Not nearly as frigid as the mountains, but enough to shock her mind into an alert state. She watched a hungry dog pick its way through trash in the alley. As she approached, a low growl rumbled from its belly. No teeth, just a warning. She mused if she was now only the piles of trash for the powerful to pick through—stupid analogy. Sigurd sat outside the entrance of their inn. He leaned back on two legs of the chair and rested his head against the inn's wooden wall. He looked peaceful, despite his terrifying injuries, as he laid his hands in his lap. And yet, without that heavy blade nearby, he also looked vulnerable. “Interesting place to perch, Sigurd.” “Good place to clear a bashed head, yes?” Adelaise gave him a chuckle. They weren’t always so different. “Got room for another?” The northerner motioned to the empty wall next to him and smiled, still keeping his eyes closed. “Kincaid came back earlier. Rough night?” “Only in my mind.” “Worst kind, then. The others you can meet with fist and blade.” “Didn’t work out so well for you. By the looks of it, you caught a lot more fists than you delivered.” “Will be different next time. Be a better thief, and they’ll be more bodies.” “A next time, huh? I thought you’d be done with those thugs.” “You should not ask questions on this.” “If you need my blade, you know where to ask. Genuine offer.” Her rear end was cold sitting on the pavement, and she got back up to her feet. Sigurd opened his eyes, even the swollen one, to watch her. “If you need my blade, you have it.” Adelaise nodded her thanks. “What do we do with the others?” Sigurd looked at her with those icy blue eyes. “That is your question. What do you plan for the others?” “I wish I had a good answer.” “Then perhaps we should drink on it. Many good answers have been found at the bottom of a mug, yes?” The chair creaked its relaxation as Sigurd raised his muscular frame from its grip. “Good thought, but not tonight. I want my head to be clear as I work through this. You should tell the others about the challenges you have and why you got beat up.” Sigurd snorted. “After you tell them why you are in trouble.” Adelaise craned her neck around and looked up at him. Every time she thought she had the young man figured out, he surprised her with his complexity. Far more attentive than he seemed. The stairs creaked as Sigurd climbed up to his room. He closed the door and fitted the latch into its place. The inn returned to silence with muffled sounds of slumber filtering through the upper floor's thin doors. A few fitful bodies slept near the fire in the common room, and Adelaise envied them. She walked back out into the darkness. The night watch paid a single traveler little heed, even with a pair of weapons at her hips. She tried to use different gates with each trip so people wouldn’t recognize a pattern or the guards reporting her actions for a few extra coins. Adelaise wondered when she had become so paranoid. A pair of fighters on opposite sides of steel had been her passion as a child. The ring of fine blades and the skill of the action were enough to get her heart pounding. She remembered her father showing her the strength of the most towering warriors deflected by the expertise of a blademaster. Now she was walking into an elegant inn in the middle of a night to see a spymaster. To tear her soul to shreds. For the family she left behind and still loved deeply. Adelaise thrust her soul into the safest place in her mind. She wouldn’t let him get at it, and she’d do her duty. Whatever that was. The inn looked the same in the small hours of the night. The lighting remained the same, and the quiet conversations continued in private rooms muffled with beautiful tapestries and carpets. The subservient staff helped her with her cloak and guided her to the room. The same room she’d been visiting. Adelaise hadn’t considered spies needed a command center, but this spy used the inn as his headquarters. Many of the staff had to be on his payroll. The curtain fell back into place behind her, and Adelaise watched the man work. Papers with text and figures covered the table. A quill worked quickly with frequent jabbing motions into the bottle of ink. She waited for the greasy man to finish his task and look up. “Late visit from my favorite exiled mercenary. You must have something significant for me. Something to add to my report, perhaps?” “Perhaps.” The spy adjusted his stack of paper and made room for the oil lamp in the center of the table. He peered from behind the glowing flame and looked over his wireframe glasses. She’d never seen him with reading glasses before, and it fit his image. “I do not pay you by the hour. Out with it.” “You asked me to find out more about the young man.” “I remember what I contracted you to do.” He threw the quill to the side and leaning back in the booth. “So, I did. I think you were looking for the wrong person before, the blacksmith.” “No, I am quite certain we wanted the blacksmith here. Her father has been looking for her for some time, and he was very interested in her return. The boy appears to be a benefit to the contract. Something else I can use.” “The boy is a wizard.” “So? We have schools of wizards. They are dangerous to some but harmless within the city.” “The schools rejected the boy, but he’s learning more about magic than anyone understands. With a group of students learning outside of the schools.” “More interesting. An unaligned wizard working with an unauthorized group of wizards. Now we have something to report. Something to work with on this one.” “Then, my contract is done. I want my payment. In full.” “Ah, the mercenary makes demands again. Always my favorite part of our negotiations, Adelaise. You think you come in here with a superior position, but you end up on your knees, groveling your way out. I still have what you want.” “Which is why I continue to work on your contracts. It’s time for me to head back into the world. Out of the Empire.” “But you are my doer, Adelaise. I have many people who want to tell stories and pretend they have secrets. I have very few people who actually do the work around the city. You are one of those. And clearly, my favorite.” “I’m not interested in this work.” “That’s quite irrelevant. The moment you surrendered leverage for a temporary advantage, your interests didn’t matter. I know exactly where your interests now are. We should keep them in alignment.” Adelaise hated coming here. He was a scoundrel and a thief. A liar and a man with no honor. But powerful and dangerous. “I need to know more, Adelaise. My main employer will be very interested to know more about the young man and his secret group. This is something my employer could use to his advantage against his opponents.” Adelaise stared at him with this new request. She smoldered under his gaze but restrained herself. One day she wouldn’t suppress her murderous urges, and she’d carve that smirk off his face. “Run along now.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Dark Choices",
      "content": "Kincaid - Dark Choices The next few days passed quickly for Sholeh and Kincaid. They agreed to come off the generosity of the warriors of their group and earn their keep. That was the easy part of the arrangement. The next part was finding work to pay a day’s wage. They found it with the stonemasons. Both were familiar with a day’s labor, and the callouses from their daily struggles with tools still reminded them of their hard-earned skills. More importantly, both discovered they had an aptitude for working with stone. Granted, their work was simple, sizing stones for the wall that would continue to grow. But the hammer and chisel work kept their minds occupied and their bodies busy. And the site manager paid daily. They’d have something to offer their small group. Falling asleep with burning shoulders and aching back wasn’t enough to deter Kincaid’s continued interest in magic. They were young and capable. The only reason to stay in Pilaetium was to allow Kincaid to explore magic with the students. The schools of magic slipped into the crevice of every dream as his soul hungered for the touch of magic. The students knew enough to make him better and teach him to control the power at his fingertips. He wished Sholeh could understand the burn within his heart. Kincaid knew the passion for arcane power could only be quenched with the fountain of knowledge. And she’d worry about him and his involvement with those students. Damithians and Thuergians invaded his quiet thoughts. He’d love to call them friends or even compatriots, but Bartalan always entered his mind. The image of academic partners fell in the flames of resentment from that one man. He’d have to reconcile his suspicion even as he lied about the dark secret he carried. That one secret kept him away from the group. Fatigue settled in his bones after each session. He could learn incredible powers, but he paid for it each day. He traded his life and his soul with each moment of magic. And his mind fought with the knowledge of how much they knew. They could share it with him, and he could explore. Sholeh breathed with the somber rest of the exhausted. Her face was peaceful with the rise and fall of her chest. She sacrificed everything to be with him. The minute she agreed to help him after his prison escape, she committed to him on the deepest level. Adelaise had done the same. With his banishment, she’d given up her captaincy and her guild. She hadn’t mentioned that sacrifice once in their time in Pilaetium. He owed them both for their sacrifices. They could leave this city after raising a few funds. But they stayed for him. The temptations of limitless arcane power grew stronger each day. He could learn from these students and embrace the nuances of magic. But his soul was limited. He couldn’t sacrifice everything just to learn. Which was why he laid awake in bed. He had the power to claim the souls of wizards. One willingly gave his spirit to fuel Kincaid’s strength, and the others surrendered with a fight. How could he tear a soul from a wizard in Pilaetium? Grab a student and show them how it’s done? He could leave a trail of corpses around the room. Start with Bartalan, maybe. His conscience recoiled at the thought of stealing lives to make his better. But the greater good awaited. If he could control this magic and do noble things for the people of the world, this could be worth it all. Sacrifices… No. Kincaid couldn’t think about taking on these wizards. And when they launched an investigation, his friends would be the first to bear the consequences of his actions. And with the wealth involved in those schools, he’d face personal vendettas and blood debts. The role of the hecaerae in the city was still uncertain. Adelaise tried to explain the centers of power within the capital and the Empire. Still, Kincaid didn’t see the manipulation of city affairs like in Caesea. In fact, he was surprised by how little the ruling class interfered in the Outer City. They’d been able to work and find jobs without the direct involvement of ruling families. The ruling families and their sorceratti. The sorceratti, the youngest member of the family. Kincaid sat up in bed for a moment and peered into the darkness. Sholeh didn’t stir. How could the youngest be trained as the sorceratti of the ruling houses? How would a family know when their youngest would be born? And how could they guarantee the youngest could have abilities with magic? Unless the ability to use magic wasn’t related to birth. Kincaid wished he could ask Magi Cormac so many more questions. They only had enough time to teach him to survive with his newfound powers. His short-lived mentor didn’t have time to explain how he came to understand arcane power or how he trained the city's sorceratti. If only he could tell more, he wouldn’t need this city and this school. But if the sorceratti could be trained, then the potential to use magic wasn’t innate. Could he tap into the power of the soul from others? Darkness washed over him. Unlimited power could be at his grasp in a city of this size. He didn’t know if his idea would work. Could he find others who were attuned to magic and learn more about the formation of magical powers? He’d then be strong enough to ignore the schools their students. There are limits to what the students knew and be willing to share. Kincaid pulled on his clothes as quietly as he could. He only froze once when Sholeh rolled over to her side. The day’s work was exhausting, and she didn’t stir when he closed the door behind him. The main room was silent except for the sleeping figures curled near the fading fire. Kincaid pulled up his cloak around his head as he walked into the cold night. The docks. Kincaid could find what he needed amongst the people of the docks. The young magi had no hopes of learning anything tonight in the Inner City, and the masters of the crafts in the Middle City would be sound asleep with dreams of the next day’s work. He’d find the nightlife and opportunity near the docks. Sounds of evening laughter danced with the tempo of the lapping waves. There’d be sailors missing muster at the morning tide. Crews and teamsters shared the camaraderie of alcohol and lived life to the limit. Kincaid moved toward the loudest bar but decided against going inside. The fewer people who saw him around this bar, the better. Magic clawed at his consciousness for recognition. Soon enough. He closed down those thoughts and focused on his task. He slipped to the alley and kicked aside the trash near his boots. The cold air flowed from the water and seeped into the lane. Kincaid wondered if he would find anyone outside sleeping off the effects of their revels or braving the colder temperatures. He worked his way behind the bar and crouched when he heard the back door slam open. The hinges groaned in resistance as they brought the door to the closed position. The rumble of a low voice filled the alley even as boots scraped in an irregular pattern across the ground. Kincaid hesitated for a moment to see if anyone would follow from inside the bar. Finding no one waiting for the traveler, Kincaid stood up from his crouch and gathered his cloak around him. He moved forward and stayed with the shadows. The magi brought magic to his soul. The surge through his body heightened his senses and allowed him to see the man in the deepest shadows. He stumbled from wall to wall and cursed each uneven step. Kincaid closed the gap before his target emerged from the alley. He placed a hand on his shoulder to steady the drunkard. The sailor tried to turn his head toward the newcomer but only lost his balance as his feet crossed. The smell of alcohol and urine nearly overpowered Kincaid as he rested the man against the wall. “Can you understand me?” “Whadda want?” “To talk for a moment. Do you see the light of the stars above?” The man flung his head backward to look upwards. “Yah.” “Reach out with your mind to them, bring them close to you.” The man raised a shaky hand from the filth of the alley and pointed to the stars. He tried to close an eye to improve his aim, but his arm collapsed back to his side. “Nope.” The magic in Kincaid’s soul howled in frustration. The surging power begged for release, but Kincaid checked its influence in his mind. His mind had to be clear to see how this could work. His heart raced each moment he couldn’t reach his goal, and the threat of discovery increased. Kincaid reached out and placed his hand on the man’s neck. “Then reach with me.” Magic surged through his fingertips and made the man’s neck glow with the arcane contact. The sailor looked upwards again to the stars with clearer vision. He saw everything displayed in a new light, and he turned to look back at Kincaid. The magi felt the slight push of magic from the man as he considered the world beyond himself. The man’s mind opened up and struggled with the effects of the drinking. Kincaid pulled the magic through the man. The power surged and raged within Kincaid, and he couldn’t hold back his laughter. The magi threw his head backward and howled at the stars. He gripped the man’s face with both hands. In a moment, it was over. The drunkard fell to his side in the trash and filth of the alley. He would never draw another breath; he ceased to exist. Kincaid stood up with new energy in his step. He tested his magic for a moment and used the stolen soul to fuel his efforts. Another soul powered Kincaid’s magic. He took three steps away, and the magnitude of what he’d done crashed through the powers of magic raging inside. The magic disappeared in a flash, and the weight of the murder crushed his soul. Kincaid leaned over and threw up his dinner onto the ground, and his eyes flooded with tears. He heaved until his stomach was empty. What had he done?",

      "content": "Kincaid - Dark Choices The next few days passed quickly for Sholeh and Kincaid. They agreed to come off the generosity of the warriors of their group and earn their keep. That was the easy part of the arrangement. The next part was finding work to pay a day’s wage. They found it with the stonemasons. Both were familiar with a day’s labor, and the callouses from their daily struggles with tools still reminded them of their hard-earned skills. More importantly, both discovered they had an aptitude for working with stone. Granted, their work was simple, sizing stones for the wall that would continue to grow. But the hammer and chisel work kept their minds occupied and their bodies busy. And the site manager paid daily. They’d have something to offer their small group. Falling asleep with burning shoulders and aching back wasn’t enough to deter Kincaid’s continued interest in magic. They were young and capable. The only reason to stay in Pilaetium was to allow Kincaid to explore magic with the students. The schools of magic slipped into the crevice of every dream as his soul hungered for the touch of magic. The students knew enough to make him better and teach him to control the power at his fingertips. He wished Sholeh could understand the burn within his heart. Kincaid knew the passion for arcane power could only be quenched with the fountain of knowledge. And she’d worry about him and his involvement with those students. Damithians and Thuergians invaded his quiet thoughts. He’d love to call them friends or even compatriots, but Bartalan always entered his mind. The image of academic partners fell in the flames of resentment from that one man. He’d have to reconcile his suspicion even as he lied about the dark secret he carried. That one secret kept him away from the group. Fatigue settled in his bones after each session. He could learn incredible powers, but he paid for it each day. He traded his life and his soul with each moment of magic. And his mind fought with the knowledge of how much they knew. They could share it with him, and he could explore. Sholeh breathed with the somber rest of the exhausted. Her face was peaceful with the rise and fall of her chest. She sacrificed everything to be with him. The minute she agreed to help him after his prison escape, she committed to him on the deepest level. Adelaise had done the same. With his banishment, she’d given up her captaincy and her guild. She hadn’t mentioned that sacrifice once in their time in Pilaetium. He owed them both for their sacrifices. They could leave this city after raising a few funds. But they stayed for him. The temptations of limitless arcane power grew stronger each day. He could learn from these students and embrace the nuances of magic. But his soul was limited. He couldn’t sacrifice everything just to learn. Which was why he laid awake in bed. He had the power to claim the souls of wizards. One willingly gave his spirit to fuel Kincaid’s strength, and the others surrendered with a fight. How could he tear a soul from a wizard in Pilaetium? Grab a student and show them how it’s done? He could leave a trail of corpses around the room. Start with Bartalan, maybe. His conscience recoiled at the thought of stealing lives to make his better. But the greater good awaited. If he could control this magic and do noble things for the people of the world, this could be worth it all. Sacrifices… No. Kincaid couldn’t think about taking on these wizards. And when they launched an investigation, his friends would be the first to bear the consequences of his actions. And with the wealth involved in those schools, he’d face personal vendettas and blood debts. The role of the hecaerae in the city was still uncertain. Adelaise tried to explain the centers of power within the capital and the Empire. Still, Kincaid didn’t see the manipulation of city affairs like in Caesea. In fact, he was surprised by how little the ruling class interfered in the Outer City. They’d been able to work and find jobs without the direct involvement of ruling families. The ruling families and their sorceratti. The sorceratti, the youngest member of the family. Kincaid sat up in bed for a moment and peered into the darkness. Sholeh didn’t stir. How could the youngest be trained as the sorceratti of the ruling houses? How would a family know when their youngest would be born? And how could they guarantee the youngest could have abilities with magic? Unless the ability to use magic wasn’t related to birth. Kincaid wished he could ask Magi Cormac so many more questions. They only had enough time to teach him to survive with his newfound powers. His short-lived mentor didn’t have time to explain how he came to understand arcane power or how he trained the city's sorceratti. If only he could tell more, he wouldn’t need this city and this school. But if the sorceratti could be trained, then the potential to use magic wasn’t innate. Could he tap into the power of the soul from others? Darkness washed over him. Unlimited power could be at his grasp in a city of this size. He didn’t know if his idea would work. Could he find others who were attuned to magic and learn more about the formation of magical powers? He’d then be strong enough to ignore the schools their students. There are limits to what the students knew and be willing to share. Kincaid pulled on his clothes as quietly as he could. He only froze once when Sholeh rolled over to her side. The day’s work was exhausting, and she didn’t stir when he closed the door behind him. The main room was silent except for the sleeping figures curled near the fading fire. Kincaid pulled up his cloak around his head as he walked into the cold night. The docks. Kincaid could find what he needed amongst the people of the docks. The young magi had no hopes of learning anything tonight in the Inner City, and the masters of the crafts in the Middle City would be sound asleep with dreams of the next day’s work. He’d find the nightlife and opportunity near the docks. Sounds of evening laughter danced with the tempo of the lapping waves. There’d be sailors missing muster at the morning tide. Crews and teamsters shared the camaraderie of alcohol and lived life to the limit. Kincaid moved toward the loudest bar but decided against going inside. The fewer people who saw him around this bar, the better. Magic clawed at his consciousness for recognition. Soon enough. He closed down those thoughts and focused on his task. He slipped to the alley and kicked aside the trash near his boots. The cold air flowed from the water and seeped into the lane. Kincaid wondered if he would find anyone outside sleeping off the effects of their revels or braving the colder temperatures. He worked his way behind the bar and crouched when he heard the back door slam open. The hinges groaned in resistance as they brought the door to the closed position. The rumble of a low voice filled the alley even as boots scraped in an irregular pattern across the ground. Kincaid hesitated for a moment to see if anyone would follow from inside the bar. Finding no one waiting for the traveler, Kincaid stood up from his crouch and gathered his cloak around him. He moved forward and stayed with the shadows. The magi brought magic to his soul. The surge through his body heightened his senses and allowed him to see the man in the deepest shadows. He stumbled from wall to wall and cursed each uneven step. Kincaid closed the gap before his target emerged from the alley. He placed a hand on his shoulder to steady the drunkard. The sailor tried to turn his head toward the newcomer but only lost his balance as his feet crossed. The smell of alcohol and urine nearly overpowered Kincaid as he rested the man against the wall. “Can you understand me?” “Whadda want?” “To talk for a moment. Do you see the light of the stars above?” The man flung his head backward to look upwards. “Yah.” “Reach out with your mind to them, bring them close to you.” The man raised a shaky hand from the filth of the alley and pointed to the stars. He tried to close an eye to improve his aim, but his arm collapsed back to his side. “Nope.” The magic in Kincaid’s soul howled in frustration. The surging power begged for release, but Kincaid checked its influence in his mind. His mind had to be clear to see how this could work. His heart raced each moment he couldn’t reach his goal, and the threat of discovery increased. Kincaid reached out and placed his hand on the man’s neck. “Then reach with me.” Magic surged through his fingertips and made the man’s neck glow with the arcane contact. The sailor looked upwards again to the stars with clearer vision. He saw everything displayed in a new light, and he turned to look back at Kincaid. The magi felt the slight push of magic from the man as he considered the world beyond himself. The man’s mind opened up and struggled with the effects of the drinking. Kincaid pulled the magic through the man. The power surged and raged within Kincaid, and he couldn’t hold back his laughter. The magi threw his head backward and howled at the stars. He gripped the man’s face with both hands. In a moment, it was over. The drunkard fell to his side in the trash and filth of the alley. He would never draw another breath; he ceased to exist. Kincaid stood up with new energy in his step. He tested his magic for a moment and used the stolen soul to fuel his efforts. Another soul powered Kincaid’s magic. He took three steps away, and the magnitude of what he’d done crashed through the powers of magic raging inside. The magic disappeared in a flash, and the weight of the murder crushed his soul. Kincaid leaned over and threw up his dinner onto the ground, and his eyes flooded with tears. He heaved until his stomach was empty. What had he done?",

      "content": "Sholeh - A Father's Choice “Damn him.” Sholeh threw on her clothes and didn’t look back at the empty cot. Life was hard, cutting stone every day, but Kincaid was returning his old self from Caesea. Until this morning without Kincaid getting ready with her. She thrust aside her emotions and pulled on her boots. Damn him indeed. Sholeh wouldn’t have time for food before heading to the backbreaking work ahead of her. She swore she wouldn’t look back at that cot. The line of day workers waited at the entrance to the stone pit. A pair of hired thugs kept things orderly as the masters looked over the individuals and pulled them out of line. One recognized Sholeh and brought her to the pay table. “Where’s your partner?” “By all that is holy, I wish I knew.” Sholeh grabbed the quill and scribbled on the line for her wages. Workers paid a fine for lost equipment, so she signed again that she received her proper inventory. She signed yet again for a liability waiver for the dangers of stonecutting. Sholeh sighed. Only the Empire could make so much paperwork to do a job. She strode to an open area with a mountain of rocks needing to be rough cut. At least she wasn’t stacking the heavy loads of stones as her day job. Few lasted more than a week before looking for easier employment. The work of a mason was steady with the rhythm of hammer and chisel. The skills to work on the different materials was more than she could handle, but she appreciated the recognition that she could hold her own amongst the apprentices. Sholeh shrugged off her cloak and hung it to the side. She hadn’t figured out a way to keep the blasted pieces of rock and dust from creating a layer of grime over her clothes. She flexed her bare arms in the morning light and stretched her lower back for the job ahead. Sholeh measured the hammer and its balance. Rough indeed and barely enough to do the work. Her chisel and hammer began their rhythm. Sholeh’s body was tuned for this methodical work. Rock blasted away from the stones with each impact. Her arms drove the chisel from top to bottom and smoothed the edges. Working metal was hard work, and the techniques needed to become a master required years of dedicated effort. She assumed a mason's performance was similar, although she wouldn’t learn the necessary skills past an apprentice. As soon as she could get Kincaid out of here. Kincaid. The rock blew apart in her fury. The blows came faster. A cough caught Sholeh’s swing at the top of the arc. The polite clearing of a throat forced her attention away from the impact. She lowered the hammer and looked up from work. Four guards waited around her work area. Worse, each of them wore the colors of the church on the tunic over their armor. Sholeh grounded her tools and wiped her hands on her work smock. All she did was move around the sweaty grime, but the movement gave her a chance to think. “The patriarch requests the honor of your presence.” One of the guards bowed and presented paperwork. Always paperwork. Sholeh didn’t reach for the scroll or acknowledge the request. “How would the patriarch know where to find me?” “I believe the patriarch had people searching for days. To find you here… working.” “Yes, I am sure the patriarch would find it difficult to believe that people labor with hammers and chisels. Work for their living.” “I would not pretend to know what the patriarch thinks. But you should accompany us to the church.” “I don’t think so.” Other workers put their hammers down as they picked up the conversation’s tension. They moved away and gestured at the standoff while supervisors noticed the work stoppage. “He was afraid you would say that. We have orders to arrest you, if necessary. Don’t make us execute those orders. Please.” Sholeh sized each one. They were more than a ceremonial guard; they were trained warriors with proper equipment and weapons. She remembered watching them practice when she was much younger. Each bore a determined look on their faces. Sholeh had no misconceptions; they would do their duty. “Is there a problem?” Adelaise walked into the area cleared by the confrontation. She wore her weapons and did not show concern for the odds. Sholeh wanted to sigh with relief. They couldn’t take on four warriors, but the show of force would be enough to make them question their orders. They only came to find a stonecutter. “We have orders to bring the woman to the church.” He presented the orders to Adelaise, finally finding someone who would look at them. The mercenary looked over the paperwork and focused on the seal of the church. Sholeh prayed the woman wouldn’t turn her over to these thugs. “Do you want to go with these men, Sholeh?” “No, I have no business there. My work is here in the Outer City, away from the guilds and the centers of power.” Mail jingled, and weapons rattled as the guards considered their orders. “I think you have the woman’s answer. Not interested today. Try again tomorrow?” “Then you saw we have orders to arrest her. Either way, she’s coming with us.” “I did. But I don’t think we will let you do that today. How about another day? These people won’t say anything if you can’t find her.” “Stand down, mercenary. You don’t need a patriarch as an enemy.” “Enemies are easy. Friends are hard to come by. I really think you should change your mind. What do you think, Sigurd?” She raised her voice to command levels, and it carried across the stone yard. “Please draw your swords. A fight would make me feel better.” Sigurd smiled as he raised his strung bow. A yard-long shaft was already nocked and ready on the massive bow. His arms were bare like Sholeh’s, but leather armor covered his chest. “Take them in.” Swords leaped from their sheaths, and the morning sun flashed across the clearing. Mail armor rattled with the move. But Adelaise was a blur. Her weapons were clear of their sheaths, the longer blade with the elaborate bell grip in her right hand and the smaller edge in her left. With a twist, Adelaise thrust the small blade through the leader’s hand before his sword could move forward in defense. Adelaise’s long edge slipped through his chainmail at his armpit. His lifeless body slumped to the ground in the rattle of the mail. The heavy creak of a bow draw and snap with a release was next. In a fraction of time, the hunting arrow slammed into a target behind Sholeh. The force was enough to tear through mail and drive the man two feet backward as he collapsed from the impact. The guards moved to defend themselves against equal odds. Sholeh hoped they regretted this morning. They probably wished they brought some friends. She scooped up a hammer and stood near Adelaise. The patrol made their move and came in. Adelaise weaved a wall of steel that prevented a blow from coming close. Simultaneously, Sholeh swung her hammer in a wide, low arc to keep the other attacker at bay. If Sigurd would take the next shot. Instead, he drew the long blade and vaulted over several workspaces to attack the pair from behind. Adelaise stopped playing with her opponent and ran him through with her sword. He never had a chance. The last guard’s arm came up to defend with his sword against his three opponents, and Sigurd’s hack came down. The man’s right arm separated from its shoulder and flopped on the ground with spurts of blood staining the white stone in the work area. Sholeh finished the job with a pounding blow on the man’s head. The yard was silent except for their heavy breathing. “That one was mine, yes?” “You shouldn’t have started so far away.” “Next time, I will shoot one of them as you fight. Show you I can make the shot.” Adelaise cleaned the gore off her blades using the church guards’ tunics. She rolled one over with her foot and checked to see if they had any other paperwork. “Still looks like I got two.” Sholeh was stunned at the exchange. Faster than most people could blink, they killed four elite guards of the church. And now they joked about it. “By all that is holy, we should not be figuring out who won.” “I did.” “You big oaf. I see sword wounds in the chest of two of them. An arrow—” “Please. These are the church’s guards. Ceremonial sentries of the patriarchs. They will come looking for them. And me.” “Then we should not be here, yes? Join me for a drink.” The worksite foreman approached with his hands limp at his sides and head ducked. “Sholeh, you should leave. I will give you a head start before I must call the watch. You were an outstanding worker, and we will miss you. Now you must go.” Sholeh held her fist to her heart and thanked the man. People approached the bodies and pointed at the wounds. With these witnesses whispering their stories, it was time for them to leave. Sholeh grabbed her few belongings and followed her companions out. The four bodies were more than she could handle now.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Challenges",
      "content": "Kincaid - Challenges The ecstasy of power filled his soul and rushed through his veins. The stolen soul channeled the arcane flow. With a twist of his newly found power, Kincaid pushed the field of magic wider. The students’ hidden study house remained still. He pushed the circle around him farther, and the stolen soul groaned from the strain. Magic inflicted its toll. No one would come outside for the next few moments. Kincaid stood alone outside his objective as a grin curled the corner of his lips. Face your future. Take what you need from them. Find me. With another twist, the magic collapsed around him. He closed the flow of magic, and emptiness left its void in his soul. His legs weakened from the exertion. He pushed the images of the voice from his mind. They’d know he was coming from the channel of power he created. That was fine today. He was past the academic stage and was ready to practice the abilities he owned. He pulled on the door and strode inside. The lights flickered with the blast of winter air. Raised voices filtered down the hallway as men and women were in a debate. Conversations stopped as Kincaid entered, and all eyes shifted toward the young magi. Even without a channel open to the arcane plane, Kincaid sensed the hum of power. Students weaved power within their souls, and all kept magic flowing as he entered. “Good evening, students of Damis.” Kincaid smiled to disarm the tension, and he noticed three new members of the group stood near chairs and couches in the main living area. None returned his smile. “Kincaid, that was you? Outside in the street,” Darya said. Kincaid nodded. “That much power…” one of the new students whispered loud enough for Kincaid to catch. “No more than anyone else here.” He pointed out Bartalan, standing behind a couch and at the back of the group. “Or even Cy when he manipulates his illusions around the room.” Several shook their heads. Kincaid was sure he wasn’t using more power than anyone else. They’d shown him the way to exert control over the flow and find his natural talent. With the proper focus, he could limit the drain on his soul. Kincaid tried again. “I can feel the magic pumping through the room right now. I came to learn more about how the schools give you knowledge. Share with me.” None of the students met his gaze around the room. “Kincaid, you are different,” Darya said. “I’m the same person you knew before. I learned everything the hard way.” “We know that. But you are different right now. The student is gone, and a powerful magi stands here,” Etty, one of the students from his previous visits, said. She was usually reserved, merely happy to be part of the group. “My quest was to come to Pilaetium to learn from the schools. You all know that. And both schools rejected me. Until you brought me in to show the nuances of power.” “And now we know why,” one of the newcomers added. Kincaid set his jaw and crossed his arms. The standoff continued. “You’ve already taught me so much in a short amount of time. I had no idea magic could be used this way. I didn’t know about the talents.” “We can use magic, Kincaid. But none of us can do it like you.” Bartalan’s voice was low, and he kept his place in the back of the group. “Right, you can work with gravity, light, darkness, illusion, and anything your minds can dream. I’ve spent more time working with elemental magic, but that’s something everyone can figure out. That doesn’t make me much different than you.” “You know more, Kincaid. Far more than you are letting on.” Bartalan moved forward and challenged him. His magic was powerful as it pumped through his soul, and Kincaid wondered why the other students didn’t view him the same way. “I need to understand more, Bartalan. You have told me so much, and yet so little. We can share our knowledge.” “I think you already know too much, Kincaid.” “I don’t understand what’s happening.” Kincaid turned toward Darya. He missed her smile and her warmth near his body. Somehow, Bartalan turned her against him. She refused to return his gaze. “So, where does this leave us, Bartalan?” Kincaid asked. “That depends on what you will share. It turns out the Emperor is interested in a magi who frequented the schools. A powerful, unaligned magi with unusual gifts. Know anyone like that, Kincaid?” “If the Emperor is interested in me, then it’s because you told him something. Something that can’t be true.” Kincaid glanced to see who he could sway to his side. None budged. “You won’t find allies here, even with your girlfriend.” Darya looked down at her feet. “When you are gone, we’ll still be here finishing our studies and finding our places in the Empire.” “Leave everyone else out of it.” “You brought them into it.” Bartalan gestured around the group. His hands were wide open, and his robes flowed around him. Kincaid squinted at the flow of power that surrounded him. Bartalan looked like an avenging god. “I don’t want to fight you, Bartalan. We will destroy the city.” “I don’t think so. Even with your magic and your secrets…” Bartalan motioned with his hands to bring the fight to him. Kincaid glanced around the room. Everyone else edged away from the men. Magic surged through them all, and Kincaid knew the moment he pulled in his arcane surge, the fight would be on. Images flashed in his mind of Caesea’s destruction. The broken body of Vedette Atros at his feet flooded his memories. The prison holding Sholeh. Tents to house the wounded and the homeless with their sightless stares. “You should leave, Kincaid,” Darya said in a low voice. She endured the glare from Bartalan with a wince. “No, I think he would be better served as a prisoner for the Emperor to question.” Magic surged in the room, and Kincaid felt his legs grow heavy from the pull downwards. Bartalan grinned with bared teeth. No more. Magic surged across the planes and flooded Kincaid’s stolen soul with might. Show them. Make them serve you, not this fool. Kincaid wielded his power and twisted a column of air to hold his weight. With a surge of arcane strength, he jumped out of the growing gravity. Bartalan raised an eyebrow. Kincaid thought, he’s never fought another wizard. They’ve only worked with each other in this magical study, not when lives were on the line. “I’m done playing this game, Bartalan. I’ve fought sorceratti, claimed the lives of magi, and now I’m going to add hecaerae to my list.” Kincaid couldn’t decipher the amusement in Bartalan’s eyes. “Arrogant fool. Come to the heart of Pilaetium and tell us your tales. Should I tell you one?” Kincaid twisted the magic around him and looked just a few seconds into the future. Magic surged across them all, but he couldn’t see the effects of the exchange. The power wasn’t helping right now. He released that strand of magic and stood his ground. “Bartalan, no. Don’t!” Darya said. The plea distracted Kincaid as he considered his next play. Any magi was a match for the hecaerae. As he saw in his vision of the future, magic surged in the room. Kincaid tried to pull in a shield of raw arcane power to block an attack. But none came. And then his magic was gone. Nothing surged through his soul. His heart, mind, and soul lunged for the magic, but it was out of his reach. The arcane plane was cut off to him, and he could no longer sense the powers of magic surging within the room. He took two steps backward toward the hallway and kept his eyes on Bartalan. The young man strode forward like a conquerer. “You need to hear my tale, Kincaid, magi of the west. Did you know what my power was? I don’t think so, but you might be figuring it out now.” Sobs came from the room, but Kincaid couldn’t see who it was through the approaching figure of Bartalan. Kincaid felt his back press against the wall, and his feet couldn’t back up fast enough to get away from the angel of death stalking him. “My power is to cut others off from the arcane plane.” “No. It can’t be.” Kincaid tried to move his feet, but his legs were heavy again. He collapsed to the floor under the growing weight around him. Even his hands were hard to pull up to defend his body from the figure towering over him. “Oh, it is. People have told me their souls are empty. The bodies long for the touch. But it’s out of their reach. How does it feel for you?” Kincaid’s mind raged at the impotence to strike back. He’d killed others for less than this. The assault was too much, and he had no response to this provocation. He laid on the floor as he couldn’t hold his hands up anymore. “Funny. Most don’t answer either.” Kincaid watched lines crinkle across Bartalan’s eyes. He was drawing in magic to hold him still and cut off his flow of power. A glimmer of hope flickered in Kincaid’s heart. Bartalan drew back his fist and slammed Kincaid’s nose. Stars flew as his cartilage crunched from the impact. Even if he had his short sword, Kincaid knew he wouldn’t be able to draw it with the magic around him. The fist drew back again. The impact bounced Kincaid’s head off the floor. He fought back the darkness rushing to the edge of his vision. He held off long enough to spit in Bartalan’s face. To his surprise, the spittle didn’t go anywhere under the high gravity. He drooled down his chin instead. The fist came back and pounded. Kincaid didn’t feel the other blows as darkness claimed him. But the image of satisfaction on Bartalan’s face was etched in his mind.",

      "content": "Kincaid - Challenges The ecstasy of power filled his soul and rushed through his veins. The stolen soul channeled the arcane flow. With a twist of his newly found power, Kincaid pushed the field of magic wider. The students’ hidden study house remained still. He pushed the circle around him farther, and the stolen soul groaned from the strain. Magic inflicted its toll. No one would come outside for the next few moments. Kincaid stood alone outside his objective as a grin curled the corner of his lips. Face your future. Take what you need from them. Find me. With another twist, the magic collapsed around him. He closed the flow of magic, and emptiness left its void in his soul. His legs weakened from the exertion. He pushed the images of the voice from his mind. They’d know he was coming from the channel of power he created. That was fine today. He was past the academic stage and was ready to practice the abilities he owned. He pulled on the door and strode inside. The lights flickered with the blast of winter air. Raised voices filtered down the hallway as men and women were in a debate. Conversations stopped as Kincaid entered, and all eyes shifted toward the young magi. Even without a channel open to the arcane plane, Kincaid sensed the hum of power. Students weaved power within their souls, and all kept magic flowing as he entered. “Good evening, students of Damis.” Kincaid smiled to disarm the tension, and he noticed three new members of the group stood near chairs and couches in the main living area. None returned his smile. “Kincaid, that was you? Outside in the street,” Darya said. Kincaid nodded. “That much power…” one of the new students whispered loud enough for Kincaid to catch. “No more than anyone else here.” He pointed out Bartalan, standing behind a couch and at the back of the group. “Or even Cy when he manipulates his illusions around the room.” Several shook their heads. Kincaid was sure he wasn’t using more power than anyone else. They’d shown him the way to exert control over the flow and find his natural talent. With the proper focus, he could limit the drain on his soul. Kincaid tried again. “I can feel the magic pumping through the room right now. I came to learn more about how the schools give you knowledge. Share with me.” None of the students met his gaze around the room. “Kincaid, you are different,” Darya said. “I’m the same person you knew before. I learned everything the hard way.” “We know that. But you are different right now. The student is gone, and a powerful magi stands here,” Etty, one of the students from his previous visits, said. She was usually reserved, merely happy to be part of the group. “My quest was to come to Pilaetium to learn from the schools. You all know that. And both schools rejected me. Until you brought me in to show the nuances of power.” “And now we know why,” one of the newcomers added. Kincaid set his jaw and crossed his arms. The standoff continued. “You’ve already taught me so much in a short amount of time. I had no idea magic could be used this way. I didn’t know about the talents.” “We can use magic, Kincaid. But none of us can do it like you.” Bartalan’s voice was low, and he kept his place in the back of the group. “Right, you can work with gravity, light, darkness, illusion, and anything your minds can dream. I’ve spent more time working with elemental magic, but that’s something everyone can figure out. That doesn’t make me much different than you.” “You know more, Kincaid. Far more than you are letting on.” Bartalan moved forward and challenged him. His magic was powerful as it pumped through his soul, and Kincaid wondered why the other students didn’t view him the same way. “I need to understand more, Bartalan.

      "content": "Kincaid - Lost Kincaid coughed out the filth in his lungs. His mouth burned from the acid, and his face was wet from his hair to his chin. The stench of garbage and sewage gagged his throat. He put a hand underneath his torso to lift himself out of the gutter of rancid filth. His shoulder and arms protested the action, and exhaustion wracked his entire body. Kincaid found the strength gone, but he managed to pull himself upright. Using one hand, he brushed off chunks of refuse. Kincaid looked around and knew he was back in the Outer City. The alley looked the same as every other slum in cities around the realms. He had no idea where he was. Memories of the short fight came back as his mind grappled with his current situation. Bartalan cut him off from the arcane plane even as the student beat him into darkness. Cut off. Completely. Kincaid reached for the arcane world through his heart and mind. He couldn’t sense the power. It wasn’t beyond his reach. It was gone from his mind and denied to him. The magi focused his soul and mind on the challenge around him. He opened himself up to the magic to flow into his soul, and he found nothing. How could Bartalan take his power away from him? A wizard paid the price of using magic with his or her soul. Kincaid could shape and form the power to his will, and his mind could create extraordinary results with his efforts. If the price could be paid, arcane power was theirs to wield. Except for now. Kincaid pulled himself to his feet, and his legs struggled to carry his weight. It was more than the fatigue from using magic coursing through his body. It was as if part of his body was gone. In the few months since he learned the powers and the secrets of magic, Kincaid became reliant on the strength to get him out of the worst situations. The deliberate use of magic helped him in his toughest places. At least that’s what he imagined. Everything was different now. He was stranded in a city without a purpose, and they didn’t have the means to leave. How could he explain to Sholeh what happened? Each step led to another step. Kincaid put his feet forward to get into the main road. He had to find a sign or maybe even the water to figure out where the students dumped him. If it was even the students. The main road was unfinished work with stones still being laid. The main street structures looked temporary, as if builders made the fastest structure possible and left the job behind. He was at the edge of the capital, almost beyond the walls. They went out of their way to dump him. Or send a message. Kincaid kept moving toward the finished areas of the street. If he headed east, he’d make his way back toward the parts of the city he’d recognize. With luck, Kincaid could make it back to their inn. The morning sky shifted colors with the glow of the promise of the rising sun. The winters were cold but beautiful in Pilaetium. The red brush swept across the horizon before the sun climbed above the hills of the straights. Kincaid typically took a moment to enjoy the sunrise, but his soul was uneasy, and his mind wandered. His feet drifted down the street. A dog growled from another alley and bared its teeth. Kincaid doubted it would come close enough to take a smell. He navigated his way back to the inn and stopped by a rain barrel. He couldn’t walk back into their room, smelling like he crawled through the lowest sewer—more questions than he’d want to answer before his head hit the bed. Clothes came off his body, and chills shook him from head to toe. Kincaid poured water from the barrel onto his clothes laid out on the street. As his teeth clacked from the cold, he might as well have jumped into the barrel. At least he got the worst off. Tucking the clothes under his arms, he walked into the inn's main room wearing nothing but his small clothes and boots. He was sure if anyone woke from their slumber, they’d find the oddest sight of a man sneaking in with clothes under his arms. The door swung open with the slightest pressure, and Sholeh sat upright. Her hands were already in motion for her hammer. “Sholeh, please, it’s me.” “Kincaid, what are you doing?” “Apologizing.” “By all that is holy, what is that smell?” “That’s part of the reason I need to apologize to you.” “Take the clothes outside. We will clean them in the morning. What did you do?” “I lost.” “Your sense of smell?” “Worse, Sholeh. Worse.” The woman got up from her bed and took the two steps toward him. In the pre-dawn gloom, concern etched her face. Her forehead wrinkled, and her hands reached out for Kincaid’s arms. She heard it in his voice. “You didn’t sound this bad when you came to me after prison. What is wrong?” “I haven’t been the best of friends, have I?” “I would never say that, Kincaid. You have been my friend and more for some time.” “I left you alone again tonight. I didn’t help with the money.” Sholeh nodded and stayed close to him. She wasn’t worried about what he hadn’t done. “I went back to the wizards, but I went back with power.” Sholeh dropped her hands to her sides as her eyes were wide. “By all that is holy, you did not.” “I did. I stole another soul, and I went back to the hecaerae. I wanted to learn more, and I wanted it all.” “But at what price?” “The price was my soul, Sholeh.” Kincaid sniffled and wiped a tear away from his eye. “We need to clean you up, my friend. Downstairs, now.” The pair walked back through the empty common area. With a pair of buckets, they drew an icy bath behind the inn. It wasn’t much more than a trough for animals, but it would have to do for the young man. With a brush, they got the worst off Kincaid. His skin ached from the brush’s firm bristles. Sholeh’s attention on his exhausted body didn’t change his heavy heart from what he had already done. “Sholeh, I—” “Shhh. Not here.” They used one of their small blankets to wrap Kincaid’s shivering body, and he lingered by the fire to get his sense of feeling back in his hands and toes. Sholeh waited for him to get back to the stairs. “What happened with the wizards?” She closed the door behind them and helped him to his bed. “I wanted to learn so much more, Sholeh. They have so many powers, and they teach the fundamentals of magic in a way that I don’t know if Magi Cormac even understood.” She nodded to let him continue. Kincaid rubbed his legs under the thin, dry blanket. Sholeh tossed him another blanket to wrap around his shoulders again. “That does not explain the smell.” “I ended up in a fight with one of their leaders.” “What? How can you fight with the students?” “They think I know more about magic than I was letting on. They are right, but I could never share the secret Cormac shared with me.” “You were wise not to tell them. Imagine what would happen if the powers of Pilaetium knew…” “Exactly.” They paused and stared at one another. Kincaid hoped she would just get mad at him and let him have it. He wanted her to take it out on him, make him suffer more for his decisions. He deserved every harsh word she could imagine. Even worse, she was silent. “The wizard, Bartalan, he confronted me. Our magic clashed—” “Like Caesea?” “No, not like that at all. I was afraid that is what would happen with a confrontation of wizards in the heart of the city. We’d destroy the whole thing. But he came at me with all his skills. One of them is to cut people off from the arcane plane.” “I do not understand what that means.” “I don’t either. But I can’t feel it, Sholeh. I can’t feel any of it outside of my mind or my soul. It’s just not there.” “Like it was before you understood you could use magic?” “No, I’ve thought that my skills with wood were based on my use of magic. Even if I didn’t know what I was doing, it was there for me. I could use it on a subconscious level. It’s not even there anymore. It’s part of my soul, and it’s gone.” “How is that even possible?” “It shouldn’t be possible to separate a person from the arcane plane, especially when I figured out the sorceratti weren’t special because they were royal family. They are only different because they are trained. I think just about anyone can touch the arcane plane to a greater or lesser degree.” “And this wizard took that away from you?” “I can’t feel it. That’s all that I know.” “We need to find a way to get it back.” “Why? I am back to what I was. People won’t be wondering what I can do anymore, and then I won’t have to worry about being a magi again.” His voice dropped away as he pushed aside a sob. “By all that is holy, you must not think like this. You are not dead, and we will find your touch with the arcane plane. There are too many enemies around here looking for you not to have magic to protect yourself. And us.” Those last words caught Kincaid’s attention. She looked away from him as she said them. “What happened today, Sholeh?” “I lost my job at the quarry.” “Hmm, you are one of the best workers they’ve had. I would imagine you could start in one of their guilds with your practiced hand.” “The church came looking for me.” “What happened when they found you?” “Adelaise and Sigurd were amazing.” Kincaid groaned. That could only mean one thing. “How many bodies?” “Four.” “Has anyone come looking?” “Not yet. I think they will keep the watch away for a while, but the church will come looking, and they will bring the fires of heaven with them.” “They were looking for me?” “No, me.” “There’s so much you haven’t told me.” “This is true. And it scares me that you do not have your magic.” Kincaid’s desperation reached out for the flow of magic. He wanted to assure his friend that there was nothing in this town that could affect them. They would never be afraid again. But the power wasn’t at his command. He sensed it now, just out of his reach. Beyond his mind and his soul. Of no use to the magi and his friend.",

She wasn’t worried about what he hadn’t done. “I went back to the wizards, but I went back with power.” Sholeh dropped her hands to her sides as her eyes were wide. “By all that is holy, you did not.” “I did. I stole another soul, and I went back to the hecaerae. I wanted to learn more, and I wanted it all.” “But at what price?” “The price was my soul, Sholeh.” Kincaid sniffled and wiped a tear away from his eye. “We need to clean you up, my friend. Downstairs, now.” The pair walked back through the empty common area. With a pair of buckets, they drew an icy bath behind the inn. It wasn’t much more than a trough for animals, but it would have to do for the young man. With a brush, they got the worst off Kincaid. His skin ached from the brush’s firm bristles. Sholeh’s attention on his exhausted body didn’t change his heavy heart from what he had already done. “Sholeh, I—” “Shhh. Not here.” They used one of their small blankets to wrap Kincaid’s shivering body, and he lingered by the fire to get his sense of feeling back in his hands and toes. Sholeh waited for him to get back to the stairs. “What happened with the wizards?” She closed the door behind them and helped him to his bed. “I wanted to learn so much more, Sholeh. They have so many powers, and they teach the fundamentals of magic in a way that I don’t know if Magi Cormac even understood.” She nodded to let him continue. Kincaid rubbed his legs under the thin, dry blanket. Sholeh tossed him another blanket to wrap around his shoulders again. “That does not explain the smell.” “I ended up in a fight with one of their leaders.” “What? How can you fight with the students?” “They think I know more about magic than I was letting on. They are right, but I could never share the secret Cormac shared with me.” “You were wise not to tell them. Imagine what would happen if the powers of Pilaetium knew…” “Exactly.” They paused and stared at one another. Kincaid hoped she would just get mad at him and let him have it. He wanted her to take it out on him, make him suffer more for his decisions. He deserved every harsh word she could imagine. Even worse, she was silent. “The wizard, Bartalan, he confronted me. Our magic clashed—” “Like Caesea?” “No, not like that at all. I was afraid that is what would happen with a confrontation of wizards in the heart of the city. We’d destroy the whole thing. But he came at me with all his skills. One of them is to cut people off from the arcane plane.” “I do not understand what that means.” “I don’t either. But I can’t feel it, Sholeh. I can’t feel any of it outside of my mind or my soul. It’s just not there.” “Like it was before you understood you could use magic?” “No, I’ve thought that my skills with wood were based on my use of magic. Even if I didn’t know what I was doing, it was there for me. I could use it on a subconscious level. It’s not even there anymore. It’s part of my soul, and it’s gone.” “How is that even possible?” “It shouldn’t be possible to separate a person from the arcane plane, especially when I figured out the sorceratti weren’t special because they were royal family. They are only different because they are trained. I think just about anyone can touch the arcane plane to a greater or lesser degree.” “And this wizard took that away from you?” “I can’t feel it. That’s all that I know.” “We need to find a way to get it back.” “Why? I am back to what I was. People won’t be wondering what I can do anymore, and then I won’t have to worry about being a magi again.” His voice dropped away as he pushed aside a sob. “By all that is holy, you must not think like this. You are not dead, and we will find your touch with the arcane plane. There are too many enemies around here looking for you not to have magic to protect yourself. And us.” Those last words caught Kincaid’s attention. She looked away from him as she said them. “What happened today, Sholeh?” “I lost my job at the quarry.” “Hmm, you are one of the best workers they’ve had. I would imagine you could start in one of their guilds with your practiced hand.” “The church came looking for me.” “What happened when they found you?” “Adelaise and Sigurd were amazing.” Kincaid groaned. That could only mean one thing. “How many bodies?” “Four.” “Has anyone come looking?” “Not yet. I think they will keep the watch away for a while, but the church will come looking, and they will bring the fires of heaven with them.” “They were looking for me?” “No, me.” “There’s so much you haven’t told me.” “This is true. And it scares me that you do not have your magic.” Kincaid’s desperation reached out for the flow of magic. He wanted to assure his friend that there was nothing in this town that could affect them. They would never be afraid again. But the power wasn’t at his command. He sensed it now, just out of his reach. Beyond his mind and his soul. Of no use to the magi and his friend.",

      "content": "Bartalan - Aspirations The Emperor fell to his knees, eyes downcast to the marbled floor. His purple silks fell around him. Supplicants, nobles, merchants, patriarchs, and the royal family gasped with the end of the imperial reign. Bartalan ushered in a new era. With a cabal of hecaerae to enforce his will, the power of the Empire was his to command. The Empire would bend a knee to him. And then the world. The vision raced through Bartalan’s veins. The Emperor can’t resist you, and the Empire will fall to your power and wisdom. Magic will take its rightful place as the tool of your hands. The voice rang in Bartalan’s mind, shaking the image of success with each word. He could be the Emperor, and he could craft the Empire to do his will. Find the practitioners of magic and bring them under one control. The trickle of magic coursed through his veins and flooded his soul with triumphant notes of power. He wouldn’t relinquish his iron control over those forces, but he felt each surge as Kincaid struggled to regain access to the arcane plane. Bartalan would make him feel the desperation of isolation. He’d keep the magi from the west away from magic until he begged for release. The schools would see the talent they had in the young hecaerae in their midst. The collection of students in their remote house refused to make eye contact with him. He made them wait as a pair of students dragged away the unconscious magi and dumped him in the Outer City. They’d be gone for a while, but he didn’t need any of them losing their nerve. Their student circle had to become more than a study group. They already knew more than the hecaerae of the fifth rank. As the pair returned from the Outer City, the group turned their eyes toward him, as if waiting for instructions. He couldn’t hold back his grin from the corner of his mouth. Magic stayed firm in his soul. “Why, Bartalan?” Of course it would be her, Bartalan thought. The one student with feelings toward the magi would stand up in defiance. “Because we need to be more than what the schools are teaching us. We shouldn’t be sheep in the Empire, sitting around in expensive clothes and examining our place in the universe until the darkness comes and claims us for the last time.” “What does that have to do with Kincaid?” A few nods around the room now. Arms started to cross, and feet began to shuffle. “The magi was hiding something from us. From all of us. I don’t know exactly what it is, but we all felt the surge… No, the wave of magic that hit us. And then he walked in. How could he do that?” Bartalan strode around the room, stopping in front of each student and looking them in the eyes. “Now, he will never reveal what he knows,” one of the male students said. Bartalan spun toward him. “I don’t think he intended to tell us anything. Rejected by our schools, fleeing from Caesea, and the killer of wizards in the west. What did we think he would do? Open his knowledge and start his school with us?” “But our group is different. We agreed to share our powers and learn from each other. Learn the things we wouldn’t be taught in class,” Darya said. “Our group is very different. I agree.” Bartalan’s voice trailed away. He forced them to lean in to hear his words. “But we all agreed that we would practice outside of the confines of the school. Even at the threat of expulsion, or exile.” “But now the Emperor is involved,” another student added. “Of course, the Emperor would be interested in an immigrant with powers to rival any of our schools.” “But how did the Emperor find out about Kincaid, Bartalan?” Darya asked. She wasn’t backing down, and her scowl deepened to reflect her distrust. “Spies are everywhere, Darya. It’s the game of power in the Inner City. Everyone wants to keep track of the others, and the Empire's leadership is always interested in what the wizards are doing. They have no choice; they fear us.” “Fear us, or fear you?” “Do you think the powers of the Empire will distinguish between individuals? We wear the robes of our schools and the colors of the Empire. Once fear sets in, they won’t be too picky about where to take their revenge.” Darya shook her head. The others were quiet and stopped fidgeting. They weren’t a poetry club of dreamers longing for a better world. They were hecaerae, practitioners of arcane might. They could be a force to be reckoned with. “What happens to the magi?” one of the female students asked. “Where did you two bring him?” Bartalan gestured to the two students who brought him to the Outer City. “Just past where they’re building the new wall. We left him in a gutter.” Bartalan knew he could trust him. That was the reason why he ordered the young man to lead the pair to dump Kincaid’s body. “We must consider our plans. The magi has no place in our future. In fact, I would imagine that he will consider leaving Pilaetium behind. He’s out of allies, without money, and separated from his magic. That should be enough to allow us to continue.” “Why didn’t you tell us you could divide a person from the arcane plane?” Darya asked. “Didn’t I?” “No, you didn’t. Until you explained to Kincaid what you were doing, I thought your power was to shift the strength of gravity.” “Oh, I can do that just fine, just like any of you. But I can feel the flow of magic differently. I can see each strand in my senses and determine the flow. All I have to do is tie off those channels, and the person is separated.” “So this is your secret. One that you didn’t share with the rest of us.” “What was I supposed to tell you, Darya? Please be careful. I might decide to cut off your magic. It’s not as easy as that.” “It’s never that easy, is it? Just like Kincaid not telling us everything about what he knows about magic.” “Look, we need to decide what the goals of this group are.” “And if we disagree? You’ll cut us from the arcane plane?” Bartalan bit his tongue. If he continued this fight, he’d lose them all. This group was the most willing to learn about the powers of magic and the flows they could channel. Each of them loved the element of risk in their practice. The schools could catch any of them, and some couldn’t afford the punishment. But they all stayed. If the risk became too high, they would fade away from the group. They’d go back to the pasture of sheep in the school and listen to the teachers' baying and hypothesizing about another abstract value of magic that none of them could prove. He couldn’t have that. “Darya, you are right. I should have told you there was more to magic. When we look at the flow of magic… We all feel it, right? When people channel magic, there had to be a way to disrupt the flow.” Magic exhausted Bartalan. He’d already pinched his stream of magic to the slightest flow of power and still maintain the link. His body ached from the earlier combat, and the fatigue of staying up all night was enough to keep his mind dull. Just a bit longer. “We need to remember why we started this group. We have a passion for magic that runs deeper than the schools. Each of us wants to know more about what we can do. And we all know the ancient teachers pacing the classrooms don’t know enough to satisfy our hunger. Our group needs to explore, and we need to keep this within our group.” The others nodded their heads. Darya wasn’t willing to confirm her commitment to the rest of the group. She’d defy them for a moment longer. Bartalan had to figure a way to keep her with the group. They’d already come together so far, and she represented the dissenting voice of the group since they started. Bartalan admitted he needed Darya. “We should get some sleep. We’ll feel better in the morning. But we have to meet tomorrow night. I will answer every question that you all might have.” Bartalan didn’t take his eyes off Darya. She nodded.",

      "content": "Adelaise - Choices The fight in the stonecutter’s yard changed Sigurd. His playful disregard for the law now had an edge of reality. In a few brief minutes of fighting, they’d created powerful enemies. Soon enough, the church would find the attackers, and their lives would be under continual assault. Adelaise could have used an archer with his skills in her company. Every mercenary captain valued a soldier who could punch through armor at one hundred yards. As fast as Sigurd could draw an arrow to his cheek and put it into flight, the commander in her knew he could outshoot any firearm for accuracy and speed. A good man to have around. But the northerner struggled with his place now. His bruises settled into ugly blacks and purples. When the adrenaline wore off, he shifted from his lanky gait to the stiff walk of the wounded. There was nothing a surgeon could fix on the northerner. Only time could heal those wounds. Adelaise was confident the group who beat up Sigurd had limited patience for his exploits or his failure. Whatever they wanted from him would be a bill that would come due. If he wasn’t working on that request's success, he would find himself with more than bruises. Adding the underworld to Adelaise’s list of adversaries wasn’t on her to-do list. Still, Sigurd was good to have in their group. Her spymaster would also demand updates. She couldn’t ignore her problems within the city. Adelaise already risked too much by sacrificing everything she loved, and whoever bought the spymaster had exceptional leverage over her decisions. Adelaise gazed down at her frothy beverage. Kincaid and Sholeh had their problems from the upper reaches of power. Some company. Impossible tasks. She looked up at Sigurd as he nursed his beer and ignored her scrutiny. The captain needed to work on one problem at a time. She couldn’t calculate the problems with magic. What she did know is they couldn’t sit waiting for their doom. Morale was a commander’s responsibility. “Sigurd, very nice shot at the stonecutters.” Sigurd nodded but didn’t make eye contact. “You didn’t have to fight with us. When I caught sight of the church making its way to Sholeh, I had to follow. She is part of my company.” The icy blue eyes turned toward her. Instead of a boastful braggart, Adelaise only saw a young man suppressing the pain of his injuries. “You would have lost if you fought all four.” “Hardly. Sholeh picked up a hammer and was ready to fight.” Sigurd smiled, “But you needed a bow and another blade to take them. You are fast with your toothpick sword, but not fast enough.” “Ah, then maybe someday you will have to see what my sword can do against several warriors.” “I would like that, but it would be better if I was at your side. I do not wish to fight fair when we can kill from a distance. And when they get close, we fight to win, yes?” Wise words from the young man. He was no stranger to fights and probably even served on a campaign or two. “You are a talented fighter, Sigurd. Why not fight with the mercenaries?” “Did not work out for you.” He gave her a crooked smile and took a drink. “Does not work well for me. Too many rules to fight with a company. Small groups are better.” “But you are working with a group now.” “Different problem.” He broke eye contact again. He wasn’t ready to discuss, but Adelaise was out of time to work through the minor details. As he said, when they got in close, they fight to win. “Why did you quarrel with your employers?” “The same reason you struggle with yours, yes?” He was right, and she didn’t like it. “We fall short of expectations sometimes, and that makes a difference with those who would employ us. But I’d like to help you.” “Not sure what you could do with my problems. The group expects me to finish a job I started. Impossible now that the merchant is expecting another invasion.” “Where Kincaid found you?” “That is the one, yes. Sigurd the thief, running from the watch because the objective wasn’t there.” “Let’s find them.” “The target isn’t a person; it’s a thing. Not something you can help me with.” “Then let’s go after the people who have your contract. Make them change their minds.” Sigurd smiled at her through swollen lips. He leaned back and put his feet up on a chair, even as he winced from the effort. “Hmm, a new idea. But then they will hunt me down.” Adelaise shook her head. “Believe me, even if you win, they will find something else for you to do. No one gets away from these people of power in this damn city. Once they have their claws in, they won’t let you go.” Sigurd looked around the room to see who might take an interest in the two foreigners sharing a large beverage. This was a mercenary’s bar, and people left each other alone. Adelaise trusted the owners. They’d fought and bleed for each other, and a small job amongst sellswords wasn’t worth selling people out. If spies weren’t in the room, they’d be ok. And Gechina was a good barkeep and knew her patrons. No one would be close enough to find out what they planned. “What do you think? Let’s end your debt to this group. Then we get out of here.” “Sigurd the thief has heard enough of these stories. You are not helping me because you like me, yes?” Adelaise leaned forward into the table, and the hilts of her weapons banged against the beer-stained wood. “I hope you will help me with my debt as well. The target we chase will be one of the hardest yet. But I need you to be free from your employers before we tackle mine. We don’t want them joined up against us.” “Do we tell the others?” “The blacksmith and the carpenter? Why would they help us?” “The blacksmith is strong and sure with her hammers, and the carpenter is also a wizard.” Sigurd leaned over and spat to the side after the mention of magic. But he continued, “Both would be good to have around.” “Taking on your employers with the four of us will be dangerous. They aren’t experienced enough to know when things are going bad, and they don’t know when to withdraw. You do.” Sigurd gave a slow nod and held his beer to his mouth. “Yes, indeed. A pair of blades taking on thieves.” “I’m hoping you can use your bow. Let’s not get into a fight where we are using a few blades against your organization.” “Good enough. Let us drink to our success.” Adelaise smiled and enjoyed her beer. The old Sigurd was back, and she hoped they lived long enough to go after what she valued against the spymaster. A thief would be useful, and his blade was a faithful companion. But against the roles of a spy, she wondered if it would be enough.",

Morale was a commander’s responsibility. “Sigurd, very nice shot at the stonecutters.” Sigurd nodded but didn’t make eye contact. “You didn’t have to fight with us. When I caught sight of the church making its way to Sholeh, I had to follow. She is part of my company.” The icy blue eyes turned toward her. Instead of a boastful braggart, Adelaise only saw a young man suppressing the pain of his injuries. “You would have lost if you fought all four.” “Hardly. Sholeh picked up a hammer and was ready to fight.” Sigurd smiled, “But you needed a bow and another blade to take them. You are fast with your toothpick sword, but not fast enough.” “Ah, then maybe someday you will have to see what my sword can do against several warriors.” “I would like that, but it would be better if I was at your side. I do not wish to fight fair when we can kill from a distance. And when they get close, we fight to win, yes?” Wise words from the young man. He was no stranger to fights and probably even served on a campaign or two. “You are a talented fighter, Sigurd. Why not fight with the mercenaries?” “Did not work out for you.” He gave her a crooked smile and took a drink. “Does not work well for me. Too many rules to fight with a company. Small groups are better.” “But you are working with a group now.” “Different problem.” He broke eye contact again. He wasn’t ready to discuss, but Adelaise was out of time to work through the minor details. As he said, when they got in close, they fight to win. “Why did you quarrel with your employers?” “The same reason you struggle with yours, yes?” He was right, and she didn’t like it. “We fall short of expectations sometimes, and that makes a difference with those who would employ us. But I’d like to help you.” “Not sure what you could do with my problems. The group expects me to finish a job I started. Impossible now that the merchant is expecting another invasion.” “Where Kincaid found you?” “That is the one, yes. Sigurd the thief, running from the watch because the objective wasn’t there.” “Let’s find them.” “The target isn’t a person; it’s a thing. Not something you can help me with.” “Then let’s go after the people who have your contract. Make them change their minds.” Sigurd smiled at her through swollen lips. He leaned back and put his feet up on a chair, even as he winced from the effort. “Hmm, a new idea. But then they will hunt me down.” Adelaise shook her head. “Believe me, even if you win, they will find something else for you to do. No one gets away from these people of power in this damn city. Once they have their claws in, they won’t let you go.” Sigurd looked around the room to see who might take an interest in the two foreigners sharing a large beverage. This was a mercenary’s bar, and people left each other alone. Adelaise trusted the owners. They’d fought and bleed for each other, and a small job amongst sellswords wasn’t worth selling people out. If spies weren’t in the room, they’d be ok. And Gechina was a good barkeep and knew her patrons. No one would be close enough to find out what they planned. “What do you think? Let’s end your debt to this group. Then we get out of here.” “Sigurd the thief has heard enough of these stories. You are not helping me because you like me, yes?” Adelaise leaned forward into the table, and the hilts of her weapons banged against the beer-stained wood. “I hope you will help me with my debt as well. The target we chase will be one of the hardest yet. But I need you to be free from your employers before we tackle mine. We don’t want them joined up against us.” “Do we tell the others?” “The blacksmith and the carpenter? Why would they help us?” “The blacksmith is strong and sure with her hammers, and the carpenter is also a wizard.” Sigurd leaned over and spat to the side after the mention of magic. But he continued, “Both would be good to have around.” “Taking on your employers with the four of us will be dangerous. They aren’t experienced enough to know when things are going bad, and they don’t know when to withdraw. You do.” Sigurd gave a slow nod and held his beer to his mouth. “Yes, indeed. A pair of blades taking on thieves.” “I’m hoping you can use your bow. Let’s not get into a fight where we are using a few blades against your organization.” “Good enough. Let us drink to our success.” Adelaise smiled and enjoyed her beer. The old Sigurd was back, and she hoped they lived long enough to go after what she valued against the spymaster. A thief would be useful, and his blade was a faithful companion. But against the roles of a spy, she wondered if it would be enough.",

      "title": "Sholeh - Time in the City",
      "content": "Sholeh - Time in the City Sholeh paced their room like an expectant parent. Kincaid tossed and turned on his mattress, and his breath came in fitful gasps. He was hurting from the inside out. And Sholeh didn’t know how she could come to terms with the church and the wizards at the same time. No one had the strength to do both. They couldn’t stay here; their time was limited. As he laid in bed, Kincaid’s brow crunched with each moan slipping between his clenched teeth. Even if he laid exhausted after a day’s work, he’d have an empty look. Now, he had a haunted expression on his face. Part of him was gone. She could not wait any longer, and she touched him on the shoulder. His eyes popped open—those green eyes under all that red hair. Intelligence and passion usually flooded those eyes. Now the tide had gone out from his expression. His spirit was gone. “We cannot stay here for too long, Kincaid. We need to keep moving before the church closes in on us.” “Sigurd and Adelaise? Are they back?” “No, and they thought it best that we do not gather too many times. Finding one person is very difficult. But finding a group of immigrants with swords makes the challenge simple. We should head out as well.” Kincaid did not get his body out of bed. His face was battered from a fist, but she’d seen him with worse wounds. No broken bones or cuts through his skin. He was under the bruises, somewhere. “By all that is holy, do you plan on lying in bed until someone comes and drags you out? This is not the Kincaid I know.” “The Kincaid you know got into a fight with a wizard and lost. I’m not a magi anymore.” “The man I know is more than a magi. You were trying to be a hero before you had any idea you could use magic. There is more to you than this, Kincaid.” A rapping tapped against the door. Sholeh threw a glance toward the entrance and then lunged to grab one of her hammers. The tapping became more insistent. Voices murmured from the other side. Kincaid rolled out of bed to his feet and stepped behind the door. At least he clutched the short sword in his hand. Sholeh cracked the door with her left hand and held the hammer high. “Stonecutter Sholeh, they are coming. We hate to bother you, but you’ve been nice enough to us.” “Who is coming?” “The church. A group of knights and priests are only a few blocks away. My son saw them.” “How do they know they are coming for me?” “They stopped and asked for directions, stonecutter. You need to leave. For all of us.” “Thank you—” “The back stairs. May all that is holy go with you.” Sholeh grabbed her bag and flung her belt around her waist. She slid the hammers into the loops and grabbed her cloak. Kincaid was in motion. He hopped on one foot, trying to pull his boots on. His bag was flung on the mattress, and his sword was nearby. He gave a few curse words as he got his boots on. It was good enough for now. “Time for us to leave.” Sholeh and Kincaid headed for the landing to the dining room when the door's crash echoed throughout the structure. Cold air rushed into the area. “In the name of the church, you are ordered to stand fast. No one is to move.” Sholeh and Kincaid shared a glance. From this position on the landing, they couldn’t make it to the kitchen without the knights spotting them. “You, by the fire, do you know of a blacksmith? She goes by the name Sholeh.” Heart racing, Sholeh grabbed Kincaid’s hand and pulled him back into their room. One way out now. The window was small but only two floors up. Sholeh threw open the shutters and glanced outside. At least no one was in the alley behind the inn. Boots thundered up the stairs. The door closest to the stairs exploded inwards from a kick. More voices were shouting from feet away. Sholeh went back to the window, and Kincaid grabbed her hands. She went out backward as Kincaid lowered her as far as he could to the ground. Another door exploded inwards. This time across the hall. Voices shouted from the common room as Sholeh let go and fell the last few feet to the ground. She caught her balance and looked up to gesture Kincaid to follow. Kincaid glanced back over his shoulder, waved, and then closed the shuttered window. By all that is holy, he cannot do this. Not now, Sholeh thought. She looked up and down the alley and threw her cloak around her shoulders and pulled the cowl over her head. The sound of wood splintering came from above. She couldn’t betray her friend, and she headed away from the inn. The Outer City had no shortage of alleys and pockets of darkness to conceal from the church entourage, but Kincaid needed a place to find her. She found a spot to observe the front door of the tavern. A knight stood watch in his gleaming mail and clean tunic. The sword was bare and pointed in the dirt with both hands resting on the pommel. No one would challenge this image of authority. The shouts were loud from the inn. A priest stormed out and looked back toward the inn’s structure. He looked upwards toward the second floor and glanced both ways to the side of the building. Another knight came out of the door and joined the priest. The knight had his weapon sheathed and held a calm demeanor. His voice was a low rumble of patience to counteract the priest’s agitation. Sholeh couldn’t turn away as more knights emerged from the common room. They looked up and down the streets, and the gathering of priests huddled together. Hands pointed to different areas, and voices rose over the sounds of the streets. People hurried by the display of authority, none wanting to draw their attention. Sholeh stepped back into the shadows as the knights formed up to get their instructions. At least Kincaid hadn’t emerged under arrest or within the confines of the gathering. A knight and a priest paired up to make four groups. After issuing a final set of instructions, they spread out to cover the streets and the buildings near the inn. A pair headed directly for Sholeh’s alley. She took a last glance toward the second floor and hoped for one glimpse of Kincaid making his way down the wall. The movement of church officials made an escape from the tavern impossible. They’d have to find another way to link up after the church lost interest in the area. With no more time to waste, Sholeh turned and walked away from the inn and her friend. She chose streets and alleys at random, working her course toward the docks. She hoped Kincaid remembered their plan in case they got separated.",

      "content": "Kincaid - Chains The knights filed through the small hallway and thumped down the stairs. Kincaid didn’t let his guard down in case they made an abrupt return. They accepted his story about his immigrant sister out looking for work. He claimed he was getting ready for his evening shift at the docks. Kincaid shrugged aside questions about Sholeh and a young blacksmith. The patrol continued their search in the inn’s remaining rooms. Shouted voices and thumping boots made waiting alone torture. Kincaid’s thoughts focused on action. Slipping out the window, finding his friend, and grabbing Sholeh’s hand was foremost on his mind. Kincaid needed to make sure they were safe. He couldn’t afford for them to get much worse. Boots stomped across the floor downstairs, and the front door crashed open. Kincaid cracked the window to the room to catch the volume of voices in the street below. They were frustrated by their empty catch, and if they knew how close they were to surprising the pair, they’d be outraged. Words rose with passion and settled in firm tones of command. The patrols split up to search the surrounding block. Whoever gave the church their tip must be a reliable source. They weren’t giving up, and he wasn’t going to get far with the patrol hunting for Sholeh in the Outer City. A trip back to the Inner City and the hecaerae was pointless. He wasn’t one of them and would never fit their mold. Their rejection was clear enough for even the dense to understand, and he doubted any of them could fix what Bartalan had done. Kincaid flopped back on his mattress and threw his hands behind his head. Old straw scratched the back of his hands and dug into the tender skin on his neck. The wood grain in the ceiling planks caught his eye. He stood up and traced his fingertips along the boards. None of this work was quality carpentry, but the wood still spoke to his heart. His mind probed the depths of the lumber and found designs. Even the lowest quality lumber could create art in his hands. His heart slowed as the mind of a carpentry master took over. His soul listened to the story the wood spoke to him. Without thinking about his hands, they reached to his belt and fumbled for tools he lost months ago. Kincaid needed to carve. He longed for an outlet for his mind, and his fingers twitched as he waited. His shortsword was worthless for carving, and the blade wasn’t sharp enough for fine work. But his eating knife was a different story. He slipped the knife out of its sheath. Kincaid fumbled in his pack for the whetstone Adelaise gave him to use to keep his weapons prepared on the journey. Sholeh showed him the art of honing a blade's edge without marring the blade or removing too much steel. With a splash, he wet the stone and shaped the edge of his knife. It was a low-quality tool without the sharpness or balance of a proper carving blade, but he could work the wood's coarse grain. The best piece he could find was from the post of his bed. With a crack, he separated the leg and placed the chunk in his lap. His fingers traced the lines, and his mind probed within the length to find the design. Kincaid’s hand went to work. White piles of tinder grew in piles on the floor, and Kincaid’s mind kept working. His hands stopped in mid-carving. His mind still found art within the grain of wood. Sholeh thought that was the beginning of his magic. Blood pounded and dulled Kincaid’s hearing as energy surged through his torso. He set the knife and the rudimentary carving to the side. He pulled a deep breath in. With his eyes closed, he reached out for the sense of the arcane plane. He found it out of reach. He wasn’t separated, just out of touch with the power. Bartalan was powerful, but he couldn’t sever the ties any more than he could erase the knowledge in Kincaid’s mind. Magi and hecaerae. Just magi. Kincaid pulled his legs into his chest and wrapped his arms around his shins. The arcane plane was there. Like when he touched wood and let it flow, the magic was at his fingertips. Close enough to touch it. Close enough to channel its power. But the magic wouldn’t respond. No, couldn’t answer. Bartalan did something or was still doing something to block him. He felt like he was in chains, unable to reach for the arcane plane. Chains. Arcane chains. Kincaid looked at his hands as if seeing them for the first time. He smiled and closed his eyes again. Chains indeed. Ignoring his soul’s lust for arcane power, Kincaid turned toward the stolen soul. He sensed the unique presence floating within him. If he sacrificed this soul to shatter the chains… Kincaid focused on the pathways and flows to the arcane plane. His mind probed and prodded the resistance. For the first time, he felt the opposition push back. Bartalan controlled the flow of magic and prevented him from touching it. Kincaid’s eyes fluttered open in the ramshackle room, carving forgotten next to his lopsided bed. The opposition wasn’t an insurmountable wall. He wrestled to control his breathing and closed his eyes again. He imagined the soul as a weapon in his hands, a heavy blade of purest power—the power of human life. His mind wielded the sword and attacked the barrier separating him from the arcane plane. A crack of thunder and a powerful blast ripped through his soul as magic rippled across his body. Only he heard the sound in a reality beyond normal senses. Wizards throughout the city would understand something happened, but the unattuned would never feel the change to the world. They’d never guess the power that emerged from the collision. With a thought, Kincaid summoned a torrent of arcane power into his soul. The energy responded with a howl of glory. With another twist, Kincaid closed off the power. He didn’t want Bartalan to find him. Kincaid had to find Sholeh. Time to create some new options.",

      "content": "Kincaid – Darkness and Hope Bartalan’s smirk wouldn’t leave Kincaid’s mind. The memories of the fist impacting his face were enough to keep Kincaid in constant motion. The students who stood by and let him lose were also responsible. They were complicit. Magic seeped into his soul past his defenses, and the room lit with his coursing power. Kincaid tightened the flow and returned to his planning. Kincaid worried about Sholeh, but he had to do something about their predicament. If the hecaerae came looking for him, he needed to be prepared. His planning and preparation were also necessary to help his friends. Would the hecaerae even look for him? With the powers of magic concentrated in the schools, would any of them notice his magic’s return? The image of the wave of energy as he severed the chains removed the doubt from his mind. When Bartalan came looking for him, he needed to be prepared. Kincaid devised a way to prepare, but doubts wracked his conscience. The sensations of right and wrong gnawed at his mental plan. His feet paused at the entrance to the hospital as he considered his options. The simple building was a beacon of hope for the afflicted in the Outer City. Inside this structure was a religious order dedicated to dignity and faith. Doctors and surgeons tended to the powerful and the rich, and the poor longed for someone who cared. Religious orders were different than the massive cathedrals and their patriarchs. The church reflected the Empire’s need to expand its influence and gather wealth. Kincaid doubted the patriarchs came out of their religious palaces to visit the people of Pilaetium. Instead, the religious orders offered a simple life to men and women who couldn’t make their way through the church hierarchy. For many who would not work a trade or master a craft for the guild, the church’s orders stood with open arms. The hospital in the Outer City was one place where the religious orders offered hope to the downtrodden. Pilaetium grew with expanding wealth and left many families behind in poverty. The wealthy of the upper cities could afford surgeons and expensive medical care for their families and close associates. The hospitals run by the religious orders were all the Outer City could offer. The religious order offered basic medical care to all. The brothers and sisters who worked the ward floors had compassion instead of significant medical knowledge. But for many ailments, this was enough to get people through. All hoped a volunteer surgeon would be available if they came to the hospital, but the chances were often too small. The religious order kept hope alive with minimal funds needed from the greater church. People from the Outer City moved in and out of the building. Immigrants came and went, and Kincaid stood motionless, staring at the entrance. The building was a stout structure, three stories high. The bottom floor had several massive double-door gates and broad windows over five feet tall. The floors above the ground looked newer than the bottom floor. The stone color didn’t match the bottom structure, and the windows were smaller and shuttered. Kincaid guessed the ground floor was once an Outer City stable, and the hospital sat on top of the structure. At one end of the bottom floor, the windows were stained glass, and Kincaid assumed this was the original chapel for the religious order's chapterhouse. With his dark plan brewing within his belly, Kincaid turned away from the pure and holy. He pulled in his breath and let it out through his nose. Relaxing his fists into open hands by wiggling his fingers, Kincaid then moved into the public square. Out of the shadows and into the light. The clinic's reception area was busy as a half-dozen of the religious order tended to the sick looking for admission. The order wore the city's colorful garb like the rest, but these were not the fine cuts and expensive materials of the wealthy. Most wore simple wool outfits with a deep maroon tunic. Felt boots moved silently on the packed earth floor. Kincaid nodded at the attendants and avoided the gathering of the sick. He slipped past the entry area to the long corridor behind the administration desk. Kincaid held his breath for a moment, waiting for a challenge to his movement. None came. As he suspected, the bottom floor was a converted stable. The examination rooms were old stalls, and simple woodworking defined the inner walls. The glow of candles from the chapel lit the way to the peaceful words echoing down the hallway. Kincaid turned in the middle of the building as he found a wooden staircase. The construction here was new, nothing like the thick stones of the stables. The hospital must have several benefactors to expand this fast. In addition to the new stairs, Kincaid admired a pulley system attached to a wooden platform. He assumed it was sturdy enough to allow several beds to be raised or lowered between the floors—simple but effective design. “Better than stairs, and it allows us to move patients without disturbing them, brother. Design and construction as thanks from the carpentry guild.” The voice had the melodic tone of a lecturer. Kincaid turned to see an elder brother standing in his worn clothes with hands clutched in front of his belly. The first thing Kincaid noticed was the broad smile lighting the man’s face. The smile defined his age far more than his bald head and stooped posture. “I was a carpenter, once.” Kincaid ran his hands along the wooden machine. Stout wood crafted to stand the challenge of time and the friction of the mechanics. “I did not believe the art of carpentry was something a person could forget.” “No, brother, it isn’t. But the guilds of Pilaetium aren’t the easiest to work with. Especially as an outsider.” “Perhaps some time in the chapel to ease a weary soul?” If he only knew, Kincaid thought. “I’d like to visit your sickest ward. Those that may not make it through.” The brother smiled and nodded. “A chance to see those who need more than you. Lives at the very end is a humbling experience. Another good choice, brother. Upstairs, two floors.” The pair mounted the stairs and wound their way upwards. Kincaid peered at the second floor and noted the smaller hallway and longer rooms. Open wards for the ill filled this floor, but families and friends moved up and down the hall as the religious orders managed their rounds. The third floor was quiet, and Kincaid noted one half was unfinished except for floors and ceiling. The other half made long wards with beds placed next to each other. Efficient for hospital construction. Only the religious order in their felt boots paced up and down this hallway. Wool robes swished as they worked this floor. Moans occasionally echoed in the hall, and whispers soon followed. Kincaid’s skin crawled as he considered this floor. “The first visit is challenging. Even the brothers and sisters working here are blessed with the patience to work with the dying. Not all of us can do this.” He gave Kincaid a knowing gaze as they came to a stop. “I belong here. If even for a few moments. Thank you, brother.” “You should consider the chapel after this floor. It does the soul good to have the weights lifted.” Kincaid nodded and turned back to the hallway. He noted eight to ten attendants, both men and women, working the wards. The ones near him made eye contact, nodded, and then went on with their work. None bothered with extra words or shared feelings. The ward to Kincaid’s left was a long room, some thirty feet long. Simple beds stood a few feet apart. Patients lay sick, weak, and dying. Some laid with eyes closed; others watched the ceiling as their sickness claimed them. Kincaid’s feet didn’t want to take him forward. A frail woman with thin black hair rolled toward him and gave him a weak smile. He found the courage to move toward her. “Good afternoon.” The woman only smiled as Kincaid pulled up a stool and sat next to her. Her touch was dry like sandpaper as disease ravaged her body. Deep rings circled her eyes as she fought to stay awake. “Thank you.” Her voice was a whisper, and Kincaid leaned in close to listen. She didn’t have more words to share, her energy depleted. “Please don’t thank me,” Kincaid whispered back. “Just a man trying to help.” She patted his hand as if she was helping him. Tears welled in Kincaid’s eyes. He’d start here. “Have you imagined the stars since you’ve been here? The lights from so far beyond. The outside.” The woman shook her head. “Imagine with me. Feel your soul reaching out to those stars. Reach for your peace. Settle your mind.” Kincaid felt the first touch of magic in her soul, barely a trickle. Enough, though. With a gentle pull, he laid the woman to rest in her bed. The exhaustion disappeared from her face, and her body relaxed, no longer torn apart by the pain and disease. Kincaid fought back a sob as he sensed the soul next to his own, yet hers was so much smaller. A whisper of its former self. One wouldn’t be enough. He folded the woman’s hands over her chest and adjusted her body so she would appear to be sleeping. His heart raced with the knowledge of what he’d done even as his inner thoughts revolted at what he must continue to do. The ward was quiet as Kincaid continued between the beds while carrying the small stool. He stopped at a younger man’s bed and placed the seat next to this prone figure. Eyes didn’t open as Kincaid brushed his fingertips along the back of the youth’s hand. Kincaid leaned forward and whispered in the man’s ear and kept his contact with the youth’s hands. Not even a sparkle of magic to be found in this man. Kincaid watched the sister of the order make a round and provide comfort for the awake ones. He moved away from the unconscious youth and tested his theory further down the line of the ward. He stopped at another man’s bed. This one was also an immigrant, probably from one of the northern states with his thick, blond beard and pale skin. He rolled his head toward Kincaid and then turned back without interest. “Didn’t think it would end here?” The man turned to Kincaid and looked him in the eyes. “No. Adventure and fame brought me here. Fever will bring me down.” “Just fever?” The man shook his head and pulled the blanket back to reveal his injury on his leg. The rotten smell overwhelmed Kincaid and rocked him back in his stool. “Worse.” “They could take your leg, keep you alive.” “Already spread. Too late for me.” “Your homeland is far from here. Imagine that place for a moment. Is there anyone you want me to give a message to?” The man shook his head and laid back. Covering his leg, he then closed his eyes and slowed his breathing. “Imagine the place where you grew up. When your strength was wild and strong.” Kincaid laid his hand on the man’s arm. Fever coursed through the man’s body, and he touched the single stream of magic flowing through the man’s soul. “Those moments in the sun… feel them now?” The soul separated from the man’s body and joined Kincaid’s collection of souls. Kincaid blinked away the tears as the body relaxed into the bed. Kincaid crossed his arms and let the body take the image of peace. “This was always a tough one, brother. You have a gift for putting them at peace.” Kincaid jumped and dropped the hand. He spun back to the sister smiling down at him. “Not a gift. I think this one passed to the next world. He told me about his wound and his fever.” “Came too late for the surgeons to operate and maybe save his life. But you were with him at his end. Thank you. We can’t help all of them and be with them as they pass to the next life.” “They lay here to die…” Kincaid wasn’t sure if he was asking a question or making a statement. He wanted to hear something from the sister. An accusation or relief for his soul would be better than her calm. “In dignity, yes. The ones we can’t help come to the third floor. The ones that can’t afford more care find their last visit here. We don’t judge.” “I can see that. I wonder how we will be judged for letting them die in this way.” “We do not see the souls of people, brother. We can only judge by their actions.” “I can’t stay any longer. I wish I could do more, but this is so much for me today.” “We completely understand. You’ve stayed longer than most of our order does, and you have nothing to be ashamed of.” If you only knew, Kincaid thought. The faint souls swirled in his consciousness. The ends can’t justify the means. And that was why his soul revolted at his actions. He left the hospital thinking of how he had to address the challenges with Bartalan.",

      "title": "Sigurd - No Honor Among Thieves",
      "content": "Sigurd - No Honor Among Thieves Sigurd tested the tension on his massive bow. The eight-foot piece of ash creaked with the latent power harnessed by the string. He looked over each arrow to check the feathers and take one last look for curves. He discarded two more arrows for no reason other than they didn’t feel right. Eight arrows left in his quiver. With good shots, he could clean up the area around the docks. He drew his long blade from across his back. He’d blacken the sword if he was carrying it bare, but he didn’t want charcoal in his sheath. It’d have to do if he needed the reach of the blade against several opponents. At his hip, the dirk was a faithful companion, loose and ready for a quick draw at close quarters. Adelaise didn’t have the nervous patterns of superstitious warriors. She’d checked her gear once and then sat quietly—no polishing, no whispered words, no good luck charms, no fidgeting. A woman confident in her equipment and her skills. Sigurd was envious because he knew what waited for them. Their plan was the best kind: simple. They’d approach the docks and then climb to find a vantage point over the warehouse. From range, Sigurd could hit the closest patrol and then move inside with enough speed and stealth to surprise the guards on the catwalk. Sigurd had to make each shot count, or this would be his last assault. He’d had his last chance to change his mind hours ago. The young man was already in motion. Action, even on a sketchy plan, was always better than hours plotting the smallest detail. No plan survived the first blows with the enemy. Why waste time? Both decided against donning armor. A stray blow or arrow would be bad, but stealth and speed were more important than protection against a random act. Dark clothes, faces greased black, and charcoaled arms were enough to fade into the shadows. The guards would have to identify their targets. Everyone was a target of the invading pair. Their path kept them off the major roads, preferring alleys and sidestreets to make their way to the docks. People in this part of town ignored the dark deeds of the Outer City. Life was longer if people overlooked the illicit dealings. Sigurd and Adelaise didn’t leave a wake in their passing. The warehouse was in an advantageous spot. No one could approach the building across the square without notice. When the guards put up the alarm, they’d be overwhelmed and captured. What happened after that was farther than Sigurd wanted to envision. They shared a sip from a waterskin Sigurd brought for the waiting. She raised an eyebrow when she pulled back a slug. “I didn’t think you drank water.” “Only when the time is right. We will have time for celebration later, yes?” “How many guards do you count?” “One on the rooftop watching the approaches to the building and two walking patrol.” “Same. Think we can avoid the foot patrol?” “For Sigurd the thief, yes. But we must take them out before we go in. Don’t want to leave warriors behind us when it goes wrong inside.” “Take them with the bow?” Sigurd licked his fingers and felt the wind. He gauged the range to the rooftop and the path the sentries took in the square below. Ripples in their cloaks gave away the velocity and strength of the wind below him, but he couldn’t be sure. “On the roof, yes. The patrol, maybe. Have to put both arrows in flight to have them land close together in time.” “Got a better plan?” “You are the captain. Should be your plan.” “Ex-captain. I’m fired, remember?” Sigurd snorted. “Come, we will do this.” He selected three arrows from his quiver and placed them in front of him. He looked at the smoke streaming from the surrounding chimneys to check the wind. He gauged the target’s pace as the guard made the rounds on the rooftop. Sigurd would wait until the sentry turned the corner and walked the edge of the roof toward their position. Shoulders flexed as the bow creaked its resistance. Fingers brushed against his cheek. Eyes focused on the target and watched the pace of the steps. One more adjustment for wind and elevation. Release. The dark arrow leaped from the string and arced through the night. The target continued his pace into the path of the falling arrow. Sigurd held his breath until the victim fell backward and crumpled to the rooftop. No more movement. “How far was that shot?” “Less than one hundred yards. Shooting downward helps. Two will be harder.” “Let me help with the odds.” Without another word, Adelaise turned and moved down the steps from their perch. Sigurd glanced at his pair of selected arrows and the departing figure. He fit the first arrow to the bow and positioned the second arrow in his hand. The patrol came into sight at a leisurely pace. The docks were quiet this time of night, and the few drunks who meandered nearby were quickly put back on their path. No one would attack the secret headquarters of a powerful organization. Adelaise stepped out of the shadows and weaved her way toward the pair of guards. Their pace shifted to a deliberate walk as they confronted an armed person. As they came to a halt, one raised a hand with an open palm to stop Adelaise. Sigurd put the first arrow in flight. She’d got the pair to stop about thirty yards away. Sigurd had the string back to his cheek with the first arrow already in flight and made the minor corrections for the second shot and released. The time of flight was shorter for this shot. The first arrow slammed into the first guard’s chest, hurling him backward in a fountain of blood. No armor on these guards. The second guard turned to see what happened to his partner. That motion was enough to throw off Sigurd’s original aim. Instead of a lethal shot, the arrow impacted the man’s side and dropped him to his knees. Disbelieving eyes looked at the wooden shaft sprouting from his body. He didn’t have time to register the shock of the pain before Adelaise drew her dagger and finished the work. Sigurd met up with Adelaise at the door to the warehouse. “Ready to go in?” Sigurd nodded and lowered his bow to allow him to fit through the entrance. “Remember to look up. Call out the targets for me.” The young northerner drew back his foot and slammed it into the door. The frame splintered from the blow, and the lock separated from the impact. The ring of broken metal skittered across the floor. Up and to the right, look. Sigurd’s eyes caught a figure leaning forward to look toward the door. Draw, shoot. He picked the next arrow and fitted it to his weapon. A grunt and a crash as the first target fell. Further left. Draw, shoot. The arrow tore across the distance between the bow and the target. The next arrow was on his bow as the pair pushed toward the maze of boxes leading to the central blockhouse. Another crash with an impact. “Other side, single archer. Drawing, move!” Sigurd kept his feet in motion as he sprinted to the boxes. Adelaise was already there. Wood splintered as the missile slammed into the boxes next to them. Sigurd took two steps back and saw the target already fitting another arrow to the compound bow. Too late. Sigurd smiled. Draw, release. The arrow found its target and did its work. “Keep going. Get through the boxes. Can’t let them escape.” Sigurd gave the hoarse whisper for his command. The pair navigated the narrow alley. Adelaise had both weapons out and probed into each corner with her blades before she continued the advance. Sigurd questioned keeping his bow handy in the confined spaces. But he expected another archer in the rafters. He couldn’t find them. Adelaise stopped at the edge of the maze of boxes and peered left and right. She motioned Sigurd to continue as they moved toward the blockhouse entrance. If they secured the door, they’d need siege weapons to get in. Adelaise reached for the handle and squeezed it. The latch clicked, and the exit opened for her. Her reflexes saved her life. A crossbow bolt flew out and punched through the boxes in the warehouse. Had she been standing in front of the door, her last day would be today. Sigurd didn’t wait for the next shot. He pulled and sent an arrow back inside with blind desperation. Enough to make a guard think twice before trying another chance. No grunt or crash from a body. The northerner threw his bow to the side and pulled his dirk out. With a glance toward Adelaise, they surged into the entry room. Each picked a direction and kept moving in case there was more than one archer. The room was still lit, and Sigurd saw one of the northern bodyguards throw aside the crossbow. Steel appeared in his hands. Another blade was drawn as the second bodyguard smiled at the pair. The spear from the third bodyguard dropped to the ready position. Where was the fourth? Sigurd didn’t have time to think about anything other than his fight at hand. Blades clashed, and the skilled warriors didn’t trade quips or threats. Their language was the violence of their blows, and this time the fight would be lethal. Adelaise moved with skill and speed. Her blades flashed high and low, and one northerner was down on his knees, looking at the entrails spilling from his gut. Before he could look back up, her boot kicked him backward. Sigurd was good with his dirk, and the blows that came his way deflected away from his body. The ex-captain didn’t pause in her assault on the bodyguard with the spear. With a flick, she knocked aside the spear and stepped within its reach. The warrior dropped his weapon. He reached for a curved blade and swung to keep her at bay. The dagger had no chance against Adelaise’s skill with weapons, and the mercenary captain dispatched him as quickly as the first. The bleeding body fell to the floor. Against two opponents, the last bodyguard had no chance, but he’d seen their ability to dispatch the others. He didn’t expect quarter and made no move to surrender. His blows were furious and fast to land a lucky shot. Luck was not on his side. Even if it were, it wouldn’t have been enough to save him. Adelaise landed the decisive blow with a slash across his hamstring. Dropping to his knees, it was a moment before the captain’s lethal blow finished the work. Sigurd spun toward the inner chambers and ignored the blood and gore behind him. He drew his long blade and returned the dirk to its sheath. The door leading inwards was ajar, and Sigurd peered through the crack into the light. Adelaise was close and ready to follow him into the office. The pair surged in even as Sigurd expected a crossbow shot to his gut. The wealth was intact, but the place was empty. “No.” “Sigurd, we can’t stay.” “We must search the warehouse.” “There won’t be time. When word gets out about this attack, we won’t be facing a few swords and bows. We’ll have an angry army chasing us. You know the watch will stand aside and let this die out on its own.” Sigurd kicked the carpets and pulled aside several tapestries. The action didn’t make him feel better. He knew Adelaise was right. A perfect attack on limited intelligence. The result was a failure. Worse, Sigurd would be a hunted man.",

      "content": "Sigurd - No Honor Among Thieves Sigurd tested the tension on his massive bow. The eight-foot piece of ash creaked with the latent power harnessed by the string. He looked over each arrow to check the feathers and take one last look for curves. He discarded two more arrows for no reason other than they didn’t feel right. Eight arrows left in his quiver. With good shots, he could clean up the area around the docks. He drew his long blade from across his back. He’d blacken the sword if he was carrying it bare, but he didn’t want charcoal in his sheath. It’d have to do if he needed the reach of the blade against several opponents. At his hip, the dirk was a faithful companion, loose and ready for a quick draw at close quarters. Adelaise didn’t have the nervous patterns of superstitious warriors. She’d checked her gear once and then sat quietly—no polishing, no whispered words, no good luck charms, no fidgeting. A woman confident in her equipment and her skills. Sigurd was envious because he knew what waited for them. Their plan was the best kind: simple. They’d approach the docks and then climb to find a vantage point over the warehouse. From range, Sigurd could hit the closest patrol and then move inside with enough speed and stealth to surprise the guards on the catwalk. Sigurd had to make each shot count, or this would be his last assault. He’d had his last chance to change his mind hours ago. The young man was already in motion. Action, even on a sketchy plan, was always better than hours plotting the smallest detail. No plan survived the first blows with the enemy. Why waste time? Both decided against donning armor. A stray blow or arrow would be bad, but stealth and speed were more important than protection against a random act. Dark clothes, faces greased black, and charcoaled arms were enough to fade into the shadows. The guards would have to identify their targets. Everyone was a target of the invading pair. Their path kept them off the major roads, preferring alleys and sidestreets to make their way to the docks. People in this part of town ignored the dark deeds of the Outer City. Life was longer if people overlooked the illicit dealings. Sigurd and Adelaise didn’t leave a wake in their passing. The warehouse was in an advantageous spot. No one could approach the building across the square without notice. When the guards put up the alarm, they’d be overwhelmed and captured. What happened after that was farther than Sigurd wanted to envision. They shared a sip from a waterskin Sigurd brought for the waiting. She raised an eyebrow when she pulled back a slug. “I didn’t think you drank water.” “Only when the time is right. We will have time for celebration later, yes?” “How many guards do you count?” “One on the rooftop watching the approaches to the building and two walking patrol.” “Same. Think we can avoid the foot patrol?” “For Sigurd the thief, yes. But we must take them out before we go in. Don’t want to leave warriors behind us when it goes wrong inside.” “Take them with the bow?” Sigurd licked his fingers and felt the wind. He gauged the range to the rooftop and the path the sentries took in the square below. Ripples in their cloaks gave away the velocity and strength of the wind below him, but he couldn’t be sure. “On the roof, yes. The patrol, maybe. Have to put both arrows in flight to have them land close together in time.” “Got a better plan?” “You are the captain. Should be your plan.” “Ex-captain. I’m fired, remember?” Sigurd snorted. “Come, we will do this.” He selected three arrows from his quiver and placed them in front of him. He looked at the smoke streaming from the surrounding chimneys to check the wind. He gauged the target’s pace as the guard made the rounds on the rooftop. Sigurd would wait until the sentry turned the corner and walked the edge of the roof toward their position. Shoulders flexed as the bow creaked its resistance. Fingers brushed against his cheek. Eyes focused on the target and watched the pace of the steps. One more adjustment for wind and elevation. Release. The dark arrow leaped from the string and arced through the night. The target continued his pace into the path of the falling arrow. Sigurd held his breath until the victim fell backward and crumpled to the rooftop. No more movement. “How far was that shot?” “Less than one hundred yards. Shooting downward helps. Two will be harder.” “Let me help with the odds.” Without another word, Adelaise turned and moved down the steps from their perch. Sigurd glanced at his pair of selected arrows and the departing figure. He fit the first arrow to the bow and positioned the second arrow in his hand. The patrol came into sight at a leisurely pace. The docks were quiet this time of night, and the few drunks who meandered nearby were quickly put back on their path. No one would attack the secret headquarters of a powerful organization. Adelaise stepped out of the shadows and weaved her way toward the pair of guards. Their pace shifted to a deliberate walk as they confronted an armed person. As they came to a halt, one raised a hand with an open palm to stop Adelaise. Sigurd put the first arrow in flight. She’d got the pair to stop about thirty yards away. Sigurd had the string back to his cheek with the first arrow already in flight and made the minor corrections for the second shot and released. The time of flight was shorter for this shot. The first arrow slammed into the first guard’s chest, hurling him backward in a fountain of blood. No armor on these guards. The second guard turned to see what happened to his partner. That motion was enough to throw off Sigurd’s original aim. Instead of a lethal shot, the arrow impacted the man’s side and dropped him to his knees. Disbelieving eyes looked at the wooden shaft sprouting from his body. He didn’t have time to register the shock of the pain before Adelaise drew her dagger and finished the work. Sigurd met up with Adelaise at the door to the warehouse. “Ready to go in?” Sigurd nodded and lowered his bow to allow him to fit through the entrance. “Remember to look up. Call out the targets for me.” The young northerner drew back his foot and slammed it into the door. The frame splintered from the blow, and the lock separated from the impact. The ring of broken metal skittered across the floor. Up and to the right, look. Sigurd’s eyes caught a figure leaning forward to look toward the door. Draw, shoot. He picked the next arrow and fitted it to his weapon. A grunt and a crash as the first target fell. Further left. Draw, shoot. The arrow tore across the distance between the bow and the target. The next arrow was on his bow as the pair pushed toward the maze of boxes leading to the central blockhouse. Another crash with an impact. “Other side, single archer. Drawing, move!” Sigurd kept his feet in motion as he sprinted to the boxes. Adelaise was already there. Wood splintered as the missile slammed into the boxes next to them. Sigurd took two steps back and saw the target already fitting another arrow to the compound bow. Too late. Sigurd smiled. Draw, release. The arrow found its target and did its work. “Keep going. Get through the boxes. Can’t let them escape.” Sigurd gave the hoarse whisper for his command. The pair navigated the narrow alley. Adelaise had both weapons out and probed into each corner with her blades before she continued the advance. Sigurd questioned keeping his bow handy in the confined spaces. But he expected another archer in the rafters. He couldn’t find them. Adelaise stopped at the edge of the maze of boxes and peered left and right. She motioned Sigurd to continue as they moved toward the blockhouse entrance. If they secured the door, they’d need siege weapons to get in. Adelaise reached for the handle and squeezed it. The latch clicked, and the exit opened for her. Her reflexes saved her life. A crossbow bolt flew out and punched through the boxes in the warehouse. Had she been standing in front of the door, her last day would be today. Sigurd didn’t wait for the next shot. He pulled and sent an arrow back inside with blind desperation.

Kincaid deserved it. Faint spirits swirled at the edge of his mind and brushed his soul. They were quiet, like shadows. Kincaid refused to touch the arcane plane and give away his location, even though his heart longed for the power, and his mind craved revenge. He couldn’t afford to burn through his limited reserve. His reserve. Kincaid marveled at how he justified his horrific actions. He ended lives with a touch of power, and he called the stolen souls his reserve. His conscience justified the act as a mercy for those who would not survive, but the morality was the same. He couldn’t afford to beat himself up over the decisions he’d already made. Kincaid had to find Sholeh, and they had to defend against a vengeful Bartalan. With the chains broken, Kincaid expected the hecaerae to hunt him. At the least, the schools would question the shockwave of magic. Kincaid wouldn’t be retaken. He wouldn’t allow separation from the arcane plane. With his new determination, Kincaid set out to the docks. Immigrants could blend in with the flow of trade and traffic, and fewer people asked questions about a person’s past, given most individuals' transient status. “Ever wish we could afford to travel via ship instead of the caravan?” The voice was right behind him, and Kincaid relaxed with the familiarity. “Often. But I wonder if it would have made any difference with the outcome.” Kincaid turned toward Sholeh and reached out for her hand. She grabbed it and pulled close to him. Her warm hug pushed aside his doubts and fears. But they couldn’t stand by the row of ships like this. Kincaid led her away from the water to keep anyone from pinpointing their position. “We should not have come here.” “This was our point in case we got separated.” He tried his smile. The sad look wouldn’t leave her eyes. “Not what I meant.” Kincaid nodded. “I didn’t know about your past with the city.” “Not so much the past, but my status with this city made it dangerous.” “The church?” “No. My father. He is a patriarch of the church and uses his influence to increase his power. I left to find my way, Kincaid. Being back has been very hard. My father is hunting me.” “I learned from the students of magic. But now I have to do something about it.” “No, just leave.” “Without Sigurd and Adelaise?” Sholeh stopped and turned to face him. She paused as she looked into his eyes. Kincaid knew the fires of his emotions guided him to paths they didn’t expect. This woman had already followed him through the darkest places in the world. He was asking for more. “We should get them. Take them with us.” Her voice was just above a whisper. Her bonds of loyalty ran deep. “We can ask them to join us. But we should ask.” He softened the blow, but he wanted her to know they would leave this place. “Do we have someplace to stay?” “Terrible place. I rented a room away from inns, bars, and common rooms. Too many people can report us.” Kincaid nodded. “We just have to stay on the lookout for Sigurd and Adelaise.” “Then what?” They walked the docks and then the side streets with no destination in mind. Their challenges were as unstoppable as the relentless tide. The best Kincaid could hope for is to ride the wave and keep floating. “I have to face Bartalan.” “Destroy the city?” “I’d prefer not to do that again. But he’ll find me, and he’ll demand to learn what I know.” “After what happened, you will face him again?” She stopped and looked him in the eyes. “By all that is holy, what have you done?” “What I had to do.” She dropped his hand and turned away. Her footsteps were measured and sure, and Kincaid didn’t have the strength to follow her down the street. Her departure caused the souls to stir within him, their loss magnifying his own. He leaned against the side of a nearby building for a moment, hoping she would look back one more time. Any glance would be a sign of redemption. But she headed toward the docks and didn’t look back in his direction. Betrayal. He’d been betrayed so many times in their journeys. Now he was the instigator.",

      "title": "Adelaise - Heirloom",
      "content": "Adelaise - Heirloom Their escape was clean. The bodies they left behind wouldn’t tell tales of the attack, and the gore from the corpses was the only marker of the violent destruction of the covert headquarters. A bar near the warehouse was a dangerous place to recover, and Sigurd wasn’t interested in a drink. That worried Adelaise. “Do you think they’ll figure out who attacked the headquarters, Sigurd?” The young northerner pounded the wall with his fist. They’d procured a room for the night, and their funds were healthy after stealing loose coins and jewels from their raid. “Why are you called Adelaise the Red?” “It’s a nickname I’ve earned over the years. When my weapons come free, I will always draw blood.” “Not the clothes?” “I picked up the clothes after the nickname settled in my first years on the road as a mercenary. Around a campfire, I tell stories about not seeing the blood dry on my clothes. It’s fun to hear people warn about the warrior in red.” “They use other words than warrior.” “No doubt.” “Why did you help me tonight?” “I have nothing left to lose. Sholeh is in trouble with the church, and thieves hunt you. I’m caught either way.” “But you didn’t have to put your life on the line.” “I’m a mercenary. That’s what I do.” “For money, yes?” “And for all the honor among thieves, what did you receive in return?” Sigurd nodded and turned away. “Things are moving fast now, Sigurd. I need your help. I can’t leave the city again without what I came back here for.” The young man raised his eyebrow and sat down on the straw pallet. He grimaced as the old straw poked into his clothes and scraped his skin. “What are you here for?” “Something of my family was taken from me.” “Ah, wealth. I am good with stealing from merchants.” “Isn’t that how you got in trouble with the thieves? Not being good with the merchant?” “Just once. Normally, the merchants learn to fear me.” “I need your help, but it’s not with merchants.” Sigurd stifled his witty reply and waited for her to continue. “A spymaster has something of mine.” “A spymaster could be bad. Kill him instead?” “That didn’t work out tonight with your thieves. I’d rather avoid another failed assault, and the fewer bodies, the better.” “What does this spymaster have?” “The sigil of my family.” “I do not know this word, sigil. What does it mean?” “It is the seal of my family. It allows the bearer to sign legal documents.” “What is legal?” “It means they would hold up with a barrister in court.” Sigurd raised an eyebrow. “Never mind. It’s important to me because it’s part of my family.” “So, we steal the seegeel from the spymaster.” “Sigil. It’s on the hilt of my family blade.” “Your seegeel is a sword?” “The sigil. Sigil. It’s part of the hilt of the weapon. If we can get it back…” “We can do it. When?” “Tonight. If the thieves, church, and whatever Kincaid is doing stack up, we are done.” “I do not know this place for this spymaster—” “I do. And he will be at his normal place in the Inner City waiting for more information and contacts. But his house is in the Middle City.” Sigurd nodded his agreement, and Adelaise felt the weight lift from her heart. She could have a chance at this tonight. “How far?” “We can be there in an hour.” “We will need time to look over the patrols and defenses.” “It’s not a castle, Sigurd.” “But you said no bodies. No bodies mean we must avoid the guards.” Sigurd lifted himself from the straw and dusted off the back of his legs. “Just blades, yes?” “If we need more than our blades, we are already done.” With practiced care, Sigurd unstrung the bow and wrapped the ash length in oilskin. He checked his last four arrows and placed them aside in his quiver. Loosening the blades in their sheaths, Sigurd nodded to Adelaise. The pair set off into the darkness of the night to finish their task. Adelaise and Sigurd stopped in the Middle City in a wealthy merchant-class housing block. The structures were on a hill overlooking the straights that provided the strategic positioning of the city. Each house stood separate from the others and ranged from two to four stories. Adelaise had been to this district only a few times since her work as a mercenary captain, but she remembered the servants working the mansions, the wealth without the Inner City's power struggle, and the parade of discrete guests. Her spymaster wasn’t a man who wanted to entertain guests at home. He preferred to keep his business away from his dwelling. In this neighborhood, the city watch acted as a personal guard due to the residents' extra pay. Travelers that didn’t belong were escorted quickly away from the area. The night patrol would be no different than the efforts during the day. The watch would likely use more force. Unlike the city's wealthiest sections, these houses didn’t have high fences or walls with battlements. The low walls kept most people at bay but not enough to slow a determined assault. Adelaise zeroed them in on the single dwelling. She remembered the night a year ago where she followed the spymaster back to his residence. The drinking had been too much, and the desire to return her blade pumped in her veins. Discretion wasn’t her forte that night. She also wouldn’t forget getting caught. The three-story structure wasn’t the largest or the tallest in the block. It stood out to Adelaise because it didn’t stand out amongst the others. The decorations were in line with its neighbors, the paint was fresh and straightforward, the walls were the same height, and even the bars on the first-floor windows were the same as the neighborhood. Nothing stood out. “You are sure.” His voice didn’t veil his skepticism. “Yes, this is the one.” She looked at the flickering lights at regular intervals along the street. Stealth was impossible without shadows to cover their advance. “Watch is busy along these streets, yes? Never seen so much activity for them at night.” “Paid well by the residents, Sigurd. I wouldn’t try bribing any of them.” “Makes the job harder. Still, no bodies?” “If we can help it, no.” The pair moved along the edge of the block, watching the people and searching for patterns. Adelaise’s frustration grew as they couldn’t find anything to use for their effort. Sigurd didn’t share the same frustration. Maybe he didn’t know better. On their last lap around the block, the watch was nowhere to be found. Sigurd made his way across the street and moved straight to the gated entrance as Adelaise struggled to match his stride. He crouched down and worked the lock with tools from his belt. In a moment, the lock clicked. He looked back and smiled, “Sigurd the thief, perhaps you have heard of me?” The pair slipped inside the walls through the gate and secured the entrance behind them. “How do we get out?” “I am hoping the same way we came in.” “You locked it.” “The watch checks them. An unsecured entrance means they will come knocking and looking. We don’t want them paying attention here.” Adelaise glanced around the small garden and manicured lawn. Servants must work tirelessly on this part of the house. Flowers bloomed in the winter months, and the grass looked like a carpet, so different than the arid conditions of Pilaetium. A running fountain showed off the owner's wealth and provided the means to keep the plant life alive. Sigurd took a lap around the building and noted the single door on the first floor. The third floor had a balcony with another entrance, but they’d be exposed to people on the street if they broke in there. “Only one door is good.” “Too easy to defend, Sigurd.” “Defend yes, but also means many people have keys to this door. Traffic means it is hard to trap. Good for us tonight.” “As long as it isn’t guarded.” “The building has guards?” “I don’t know. Not like I’m a regular guest.” Sigurd shook his head and crouched to get to his work on the door. He muttered a few swear words as his fingers probed the inner workings, and his ears hunted for clues to the lock. With another mechanical click, the latch gave way to his skill. The pair slipped inside, and Sigurd closed the entrance behind him. He used a shim of metal to prevent the lock from engaging into the frame. “Our only option for escape. Do not lock ourselves in, yes?” Adelaise smiled and looked toward the grand staircase leading upwards. The spiral stairs were a broad structure of perfect stone and crafted railings of marble. A golden statue of an eagle snatching a fish from water guarded the lowest landing. A single lamp illuminated the staircase, and the light played across the golden feathers of the statue. The ex-captain led them upstairs to the second floor. The soft soles of their boots made little sound as they worked their way up the marble stairs. The second floor was carpeted with wealth from around the world. The spymaster had simple tastes, but the choices were elegant. The carpet here was clean and showed only a few servants worked on this floor. Their fast pace carried no sound from the plush material. Adelaise couldn’t let her guard down. The entrance room to the floor also held the spiral staircase up to the third floor, but the waiting area was broad and open. The fireplace was cold. A thrifty measure for a master always busy at night. Adelaise led them to the right into a study. Windows provided openings for moonlight to trickle into this room. The pale blue light revealed bookshelves covering the walls from floor to fifteen-foot ceilings. Scrolls, parchments, and books carefully lined each shelf, covered the desks, and even lay on the seats' cushions. The room was impressive, even for a man of wealth. Sigurd and Adelaise strolled into the room and looked upon its wonders. “What does he do with all of the paper?” Adelaise looked up at her companion. “I would imagine he reads it.” “All of it?” He looked around the room. “Who has the time for this?” “Look carefully. This is where he displays his wealth. Not the paintings or tapestries. It’s here. This is what he does.” “Writes poems. Not wealth at all.” They started at the bookshelves and searched through the belongings. Adelaise didn’t know what she was looking for. Anything out of place. Books not perfectly flush, dust or lack of dust on a shelf, a passage to a treasure room, a hidden section of a desk to hide great wealth. Something a spymaster… It was on the wall. A display case held a blade that made the one at her hip look like the tool of a pauper. The naked sword held perfect edges, a point to cut through armor, a bell guard of elaborate woven steel, and a pommel with a noble family's seal. She walked straight to the display. “You’ve come for it. I wondered when this day would happen.” Sigurd and Adelaise spun around to the voice. Four people stood at the grand entrance to the library. “And on the same day you attacked the thieves. Quite a way to build your enemies. At least you picked the powerful ones.” “I think our contract is over.” “Of course you would think that. You brought a barbarian friend with a big sword to break into my house and steal my property.” “My property, stolen from me. Part of my family.” “Irrelevant now, I’m afraid. You see, the thieves are already here with me.” He guested to the pair of people next to him. “I’ll get what I need, and you won’t have that blade. It’ll stay part of my collection, and your family will now do as I tell them. Because I’ll sign the paperwork to do so.” Sigurd was on the balls of his feet, his hands and arms ready for action. He waited for Adelaise to make a move toward her weapons. “You left a wake of bodies at the docks, Sigurd. Yes, yes. That’ll take me months to recover the workforce and the wealth. And I’m going to take it out of your hide this time. No patience for this failure, I’m afraid.” The smaller man spoke directly to Sigurd, and Adelaise knew the spymaster and thieves had been in coordination for some time. What she couldn’t figure out is how they were betrayed. “How does this end?” Adelaise asked. “Intruders in my house trying to steal my wealth? Either with your capture and imprisonment or your bodies cleaned up by my servants—\" “Enough talk then.” Sigurd roared into action. His long blade tore from its sheath and reflected the moonlight flowing into the room. The large man behind the head of the thieves drew his longsword and axe from his belt. Another northerner. A youth like Sigurd but with the practiced poise of a blademaster. The spymaster’s bodyguard moved forward in a blur. He threw a knife from his belt and followed with two more from his wrist. Adelaise was already in motion to the side and registered the blades slamming into the books where she once stood. Her blades came free and weaved a wall of steel in front of her. Steel collided against steel to the side as angry male voices roared in the night air. Adelaise and her opponent closed the gap, and the bodyguard was wise to use a pair of daggers. He held them close to his body and looked for openings in Adelaise’s defenses. Not waiting for the fight to develop, Adelaise launched attacks from blade and dagger. She showed no quarter as the attacks flashed out. Blows met only steel as the man stayed in motion with weapons and feet. Adelaise saw the leader of the thieves and even the spymaster draw weapons. None were shy to get their hands dirty. They’d grown up in this business. Adelaise changed her attack pattern and moved to close the gap between her and Sigurd. Her opponent figured out too late that she was fighting to get by Sigurd’s side, and her opponent could not prevent the movement to protect the flanks. But she wasn’t protecting. In a blur, her blade lashed out and slashed across Sigurd’s opponent’s kneecap. The man dropped to the ground and bellowed his pain. It was his last breath as Sigurd drove a foot of steel through his chest. Sigurd nodded his thanks and pressed the attack against the head of the thieves. The heavy blade pushed the man back, but Sigurd wouldn’t leave Adelaise’s side undefended against her two skilled opponents. She couldn’t afford more reckless attacks against the pair. Each one of her blows was measured for the minimum effort to deflect an attack. She hunted for favorite blows and unconscious patterns. The spymaster was probably skilled in his prime as an assassin or low-level thug. But he was out of practice. She could dispatch him first. But her skilled dagger-wielding opponent would make her pay for the distraction. Sigurd made a broad thrust forward and drove his opponent backward in defense. Adelaise barely blocked the attack aimed toward Sigurd’s chest. He pulled back from the line of attack and out of Adelaise’s sight. She was exposed and opened. In a moment, she’d be pressed by three attackers. With their skill, far more than she could handle. Glass broke behind her, and then Sigurd was back. His heavy blade wove a wall of steel as he lunged forward. The weight and ferocity of the attack lacked the poise of a blademaster, but the smaller blades wouldn’t stop the driving force behind the hammering attacks. In his left hand was the blade—the blade of her family. Without looking back, he tossed the sword in her direction. She hurled her old blade at the spymaster in a straight and true throw. She grabbed her family blade out of the air from the toss. The hilt was already warm to the touch and hummed with its own life. It responded to her thoughts with precision and lethality. With Sigurd surging forward to give her a moment, she followed him with a smile hurting the corner of her mouth. The thrown blade caught the spymaster across his arm, and he turned and sprinted toward the spiral staircase. Sigurd and Adelaise fought the remaining pair. The head of the thieves made the first mistake as he misjudged the strength of Sigurd’s blow. The massive sword slammed down and crushed the fruitless defense. Chunks of flesh dangled from where his forearm once hung attached to his body. A knife blade flashed out from Adelaise’s opponent, but she wasn’t the target. Sigurd staggered back as he looked at the hilt of the knife poking out of his chest. Adelaise lunged into the attack and wove deadly steel with speed. The man couldn’t stand up to the assault and gave ground. His eyes flicked to check on Sigurd’s recovery, and that was the last mistake the skilled assassin made. Adelaise’s family sword found his heart through the ribcage. He was dead before his body hit the floor. Without a thought, she cut the throat of the head of thieves and left his bleeding body on the floor. Sigurd was leaning against a bookcase. Books and papers fluttered around him from his weight against the structure. Blood soaked his shirt from the wound, and his breath was shallow and fast. “It was a good throw, yes?” “Perfect, Sigurd. Just perfect.” He glanced at the blade in his chest and said, “His was good, too.” The heavy blade thunked to the carpet at his feet. He grabbed the pommel of the knife and closed his eyes. “Sigurd, wait. We should…” The blade was out with barely a gasp. Sigurd threw the knife to the side and looked at the blood in his hands. The wound bled freely now. “Grab his cloak, yes?” They crafted a makeshift bandage for the wounded northerner. “We need to get out of here, Sigurd. He ran, but he’ll be back with a vengeance and reinforcements.” “Out the way we came, yes?” “Of course.” “Need to be a better thief sometime.”",

      "content": "Adelaise - Heirloom Their escape was clean. The bodies they left behind wouldn’t tell tales of the attack, and the gore from the corpses was the only marker of the violent destruction of the covert headquarters. A bar near the warehouse was a dangerous place to recover, and Sigurd wasn’t interested in a drink. That worried Adelaise. “Do you think they’ll figure out who attacked the headquarters, Sigurd?” The young northerner pounded the wall with his fist. They’d procured a room for the night, and their funds were healthy after stealing loose coins and jewels from their raid. “Why are you called Adelaise the Red?” “It’s a nickname I’ve earned over the years. When my weapons come free, I will always draw blood.” “Not the clothes?” “I picked up the clothes after the nickname settled in my first years on the road as a mercenary. Around a campfire, I tell stories about not seeing the blood dry on my clothes. It’s fun to hear people warn about the warrior in red.” “They use other words than warrior.” “No doubt.” “Why did you help me tonight?” “I have nothing left to lose. Sholeh is in trouble with the church, and thieves hunt you. I’m caught either way.” “But you didn’t have to put your life on the line.” “I’m a mercenary. That’s what I do.” “For money, yes?” “And for all the honor among thieves, what did you receive in return?” Sigurd nodded and turned away. “Things are moving fast now, Sigurd. I need your help. I can’t leave the city again without what I came back here for.” The young man raised his eyebrow and sat down on the straw pallet. He grimaced as the old straw poked into his clothes and scraped his skin. “What are you here for?” “Something of my family was taken from me.” “Ah, wealth. I am good with stealing from merchants.” “Isn’t that how you got in trouble with the thieves? Not being good with the merchant?” “Just once. Normally, the merchants learn to fear me.” “I need your help, but it’s not with merchants.” Sigurd stifled his witty reply and waited for her to continue. “A spymaster has something of mine.” “A spymaster could be bad. Kill him instead?” “That didn’t work out tonight with your thieves. I’d rather avoid another failed assault, and the fewer bodies, the better.” “What does this spymaster have?” “The sigil of my family.” “I do not know this word, sigil. What does it mean?” “It is the seal of my family. It allows the bearer to sign legal documents.” “What is legal?” “It means they would hold up with a barrister in court.” Sigurd raised an eyebrow. “Never mind. It’s important to me because it’s part of my family.” “So, we steal the seegeel from the spymaster.” “Sigil. It’s on the hilt of my family blade.” “Your seegeel is a sword?” “The sigil. Sigil. It’s part of the hilt of the weapon. If we can get it back…” “We can do it. When?” “Tonight. If the thieves, church, and whatever Kincaid is doing stack up, we are done.” “I do not know this place for this spymaster—” “I do. And he will be at his normal place in the Inner City waiting for more information and contacts. But his house is in the Middle City.” Sigurd nodded his agreement, and Adelaise felt the weight lift from her heart. She could have a chance at this tonight. “How far?” “We can be there in an hour.” “We will need time to look over the patrols and defenses.” “It’s not a castle, Sigurd.” “But you said no bodies. No bodies mean we must avoid the guards.” Sigurd lifted himself from the straw and dusted off the back of his legs. “Just blades, yes?” “If we need more than our blades, we are already done.” With practiced care, Sigurd unstrung the bow and wrapped the ash length in oilskin. He checked his last four arrows and placed them aside in his quiver. Loosening the blades in their sheaths, Sigurd nodded to Adelaise. The pair set off into the darkness of the night to finish their task. Adelaise and Sigurd stopped in the Middle City in a wealthy merchant-class housing block. The structures were on a hill overlooking the straights that provided the strategic positioning of the city. Each house stood separate from the others and ranged from two to four stories. Adelaise had been to this district only a few times since her work as a mercenary captain, but she remembered the servants working the mansions, the wealth without the Inner City's power struggle, and the parade of discrete guests. Her spymaster wasn’t a man who wanted to entertain guests at home. He preferred to keep his business away from his dwelling. In this neighborhood, the city watch acted as a personal guard due to the residents' extra pay. Travelers that didn’t belong were escorted quickly away from the area. The night patrol would be no different than the efforts during the day. The watch would likely use more force. Unlike the city's wealthiest sections, these houses didn’t have high fences or walls with battlements. The low walls kept most people at bay but not enough to slow a determined assault. Adelaise zeroed them in on the single dwelling. She remembered the night a year ago where she followed the spymaster back to his residence. The drinking had been too much, and the desire to return her blade pumped in her veins. Discretion wasn’t her forte that night. She also wouldn’t forget getting caught. The three-story structure wasn’t the largest or the tallest in the block. It stood out to Adelaise because it didn’t stand out amongst the others. The decorations were in line with its neighbors, the paint was fresh and straightforward, the walls were the same height, and even the bars on the first-floor windows were the same as the neighborhood. Nothing stood out. “You are sure.” His voice didn’t veil his skepticism. “Yes, this is the one.” She looked at the flickering lights at regular intervals along the street. Stealth was impossible without shadows to cover their advance. “Watch is busy along these streets, yes? Never seen so much activity for them at night.” “Paid well by the residents, Sigurd. I wouldn’t try bribing any of them.” “Makes the job harder. Still, no bodies?” “If we can help it, no.” The pair moved along the edge of the block, watching the people and searching for patterns. Adelaise’s frustration grew as they couldn’t find anything to use for their effort. Sigurd didn’t share the same frustration. Maybe he didn’t know better. On their last lap around the block, the watch was nowhere to be found. Sigurd made his way across the street and moved straight to the gated entrance as Adelaise struggled to match his stride. He crouched down and worked the lock with tools from his belt. In a moment, the lock clicked. He looked back and smiled, “Sigurd the thief, perhaps you have heard of me?” The pair slipped inside the walls through the gate and secured the entrance behind them. “How do we get out?” “I am hoping the same way we came in.” “You locked it.” “The watch checks them. An unsecured entrance means they will come knocking and looking. We don’t want them paying attention here.” Adelaise glanced around the small garden and manicured lawn. Servants must work tirelessly on this part of the house. Flowers bloomed in the winter months, and the grass looked like a carpet, so different than the arid conditions of Pilaetium. A running fountain showed off the owner's wealth and provided the means to keep the plant life alive. Sigurd took a lap around the building and noted the single door on the first floor. The third floor had a balcony with another entrance, but they’d be exposed to people on the street if they broke in there. “Only one door is good.” “Too easy to defend, Sigurd.” “Defend yes, but also means many people have keys to this door. Traffic means it is hard to trap. Good for us tonight.” “As long as it isn’t guarded.” “The building has guards?” “I don’t know. Not like I’m a regular guest.” Sigurd shook his head and crouched to get to his work on the door. He muttered a few swear words as his fingers probed the inner workings, and his ears hunted for clues to the lock. With another mechanical click, the latch gave way to his skill. The pair slipped inside, and Sigurd closed the entrance behind him. He used a shim of metal to prevent the lock from engaging into the frame. “Our only option for escape. Do not lock ourselves in, yes?” Adelaise smiled and looked toward the grand staircase leading upwards. The spiral stairs were a broad structure of perfect stone and crafted railings of marble. A golden statue of an eagle snatching a fish from water guarded the lowest landing. A single lamp illuminated the staircase, and the light played across the golden feathers of the statue. The ex-captain led them upstairs to the second floor. The soft soles of their boots made little sound as they worked their way up the marble stairs. The second floor was carpeted with wealth from around the world. The spymaster had simple tastes, but the choices were elegant. The carpet here was clean and showed only a few servants worked on this floor. Their fast pace carried no sound from the plush material. Adelaise couldn’t let her guard down. The entrance room to the floor also held the spiral staircase up to the third floor, but the waiting area was broad and open. The fireplace was cold. A thrifty measure for a master always busy at night. Adelaise led them to the right into a study. Windows provided openings for moonlight to trickle into this room. The pale blue light revealed bookshelves covering the walls from floor to fifteen-foot ceilings. Scrolls, parchments, and books carefully lined each shelf, covered the desks, and even lay on the seats' cushions. The room was impressive, even for a man of wealth. Sigurd and Adelaise strolled into the room and looked upon its wonders. “What does he do with all of the paper?” Adelaise looked up at her companion. “I would imagine he reads it.” “All of it?” He looked around the room. “Who has the time for this?” “Look carefully.

A display case held a blade that made the one at her hip look like the tool of a pauper. The naked sword held perfect edges, a point to cut through armor, a bell guard of elaborate woven steel, and a pommel with a noble family's seal. She walked straight to the display. “You’ve come for it. I wondered when this day would happen.” Sigurd and Adelaise spun around to the voice. Four people stood at the grand entrance to the library. “And on the same day you attacked the thieves. Quite a way to build your enemies.

      "content": "Sigurd - Next Move “Just a scratch.” “Then stop bleeding down your side,” Adelaise said, offering no sympathy to the wounded northerner. Sigurd held his composure as they left the Middle City gates behind. The alarm hadn’t been raised, and the wound was covered well enough to prevent him from soaking his side in blood. He winced with each step, and he hurt more as the battle rage faded. “Find a bar to hold up, yes?” “How can you think about drinking now?” “Good for wounds.” He winced as he glanced toward Adelaise. “And we need to find Kincaid and Sholeh.” “We do, before the wrath of the spies come down on us.” “How much time?” “Weeks, days, hours. I don’t know what resources he still has at his disposal. If the emperor is interested in our friend…” “Which one?” “Kincaid. He’s the one with magic, remember?” Sigurd leaned over and spit to the side. “The spies sent you to find the blacksmith. But you ended up finding more about Kincaid.” “I know. The spymaster was too engaged in what we were doing. Our group is different from any other I’ve been around.” “A bar?” “We also need to locate our companions.” “I drink, and you can find them.” “Leave you to take on whatever comes our way? Thieves? Spies? Guards?” Sigurd smiled and then clutched his side to hold in the shooting pain as he coughed. “It will be a glorious death.” “I can’t believe I’m going to agree to this.” “The charm of a thief, yes?” “No, the requirement to get us out of this city before the streets erupt.” Adelaise had the kindness to set up a tab for Sigurd at a bar near the docks. The first draft was warm, and the northerner wondered how someone could waste the effort to brew beer and then make it so bad. The captain walked out the door, her stride showing her determination to finish her mission. They had to get everyone back together and head out of the city. Sigurd needed to take care of himself. The choice of this bar wasn’t an accident. Every thief had a safe house with people as reliable as they could be bought, and this was one of those places that let Sigurd pay for anonymity. With the leader of the thieves dead, Sigurd needed time. The guild members would take days to reorganize as the struggle for power among the lieutenants could become violent. In the end, only one would lead the organization, and Sigurd’s small group had to be gone before someone investigated the violence of the evening. Glancing around the bar to check for unusual actions and unnecessary scrutiny, Sigurd caught the attention of one of the servers. She came over with another beer, which he grabbed from her tray. “Room three available now?” The woman’s face changed from the bright smile of service to the serious look of business. “I’ll check.” She went back to the bar and whispered to the barkeep. The man looked over at Sigurd and sized him up from halfway across the room. The barkeep nodded in the northerner’s direction. His wounds were stiff as Sigurd stood up. The blood was drying and caking on his side, and his shirt stuck to his puckered skin. He grabbed the beer in his fist and made his way up the back stairs. This seedy bar had the extra rooms here for business, not long-term stays. Sigurd ignored the passionate sounds from behind closed doors and paused at door three. He leaned in to listen through the wood as old habits were hard to break. With only the rustle of papers from the other side, he pushed the door open and walked in. “Sigurd, my friend. You look like a pile of horse dung.” A frail woman sat at a mismatched table with an oil lamp and several books. She didn’t bother with the flashy colors of robes and the fine material typical to the capital. Instead, she wore sturdy woolen clothes, including pants tucked into boots. Her smile was crooked and genuine. “Some things don’t change, yes?” “I thought you were a thief, Sigurd…” She raised her wispy body from her seat with a sigh and approached the young man. Hands investigated the wet stain on his side, and wrinkles covered her forehead as she analyzed the bloodstain. The woman didn’t come up halfway up Sigurd’s chest. “And a famous warrior.” “Just not a good one, I see.” Fingers probed the torn skin and redness around the wound. “You almost waited too long, my friend.” “Patch me up? I think I will end up in another fight.” “You should win one now and then.” “You should see the bodies of those that won’t come to you.” “Sigurd, you didn’t.” “I’ll be leaving soon. But I can’t bleed out on the street.” The woman turned back to the chest of drawers by the desk. She motioned him to sit down on the straw mattress. “Might as well sit down, so you don’t fall over.” She removed vials and jars from her supplies. Water from a pitcher made its way into a pot over an open flame. Preparations for the wound started as the water began to boil. The woman’s touch was efficient and not gentle. But the salves and jars of fluids made the pain bearable, and the wound responded to her touch. She cleaned, sewed, and patched to make his body whole. The doctor even clucked when she worked on the other injuries from his beating. “I would tell you to wait several weeks to let all of this close and heal. You were lucky to survive this time. Don’t push your luck.” She held up her hand as Sigurd drew his breath. “But I know better, my friend. I wish you weren’t one of my customers.” “Naia, why do you stay here in the docks?” “You’ve never asked me that before. No one does. They just leave better than when they came in here.” “Yes, but you could run a shop in the Middle or even Inner City.” The woman cleaned up her supplies, and her gaze was unfocused as she washed up her hands with the remaining water from the pitcher. “Like you, some of us are trapped by our choices in this town. Some have to make amends for their last pieces of work.” “If it’s the thieves, you can clear your name. There are many bodies to prove it.” “Oh, Sigurd. You are a young fool. Those are the easy bonds, I’m afraid.” Sigurd didn’t pretend to understand what she was saying. He told her what he wanted her to know, and he offered her a chance to escape from this life of patching up sailors, thieves, and terrible warriors. How many others gave her a new opportunity? “I will be leaving.” “You should, my friend.” “It will be tough not coming back to see you.” “Your type always comes back, Sigurd. Your sword and ideas are bigger than your skills.” Sigurd chuckled as he pulled his torn shirt over his head. His muscles protested, but her work was excellent. Shaking her head, Naia handed him a small vial and rolled his fingers over it. “It will keep the infection away because I know you will tear my work up. This will give you a chance.” Sigurd smiled and then leaned down to place a kiss on her forehead. As he walked out, he wondered how long before she told the thieves he’d visited for his wounds. He’d cross that bridge later.",

      "content": "Sigurd - Next Move “Just a scratch.” “Then stop bleeding down your side,” Adelaise said, offering no sympathy to the wounded northerner. Sigurd held his composure as they left the Middle City gates behind. The alarm hadn’t been raised, and the wound was covered well enough to prevent him from soaking his side in blood. He winced with each step, and he hurt more as the battle rage faded. “Find a bar to hold up, yes?” “How can you think about drinking now?” “Good for wounds.” He winced as he glanced toward Adelaise. “And we need to find Kincaid and Sholeh.” “We do, before the wrath of the spies come down on us.” “How much time?” “Weeks, days, hours. I don’t know what resources he still has at his disposal. If the emperor is interested in our friend…” “Which one?” “Kincaid. He’s the one with magic, remember?” Sigurd leaned over and spit to the side. “The spies sent you to find the blacksmith. But you ended up finding more about Kincaid.” “I know. The spymaster was too engaged in what we were doing. Our group is different from any other I’ve been around.” “A bar?” “We also need to locate our companions.” “I drink, and you can find them.” “Leave you to take on whatever comes our way? Thieves? Spies? Guards?” Sigurd smiled and then clutched his side to hold in the shooting pain as he coughed. “It will be a glorious death.” “I can’t believe I’m going to agree to this.” “The charm of a thief, yes?” “No, the requirement to get us out of this city before the streets erupt.” Adelaise had the kindness to set up a tab for Sigurd at a bar near the docks. The first draft was warm, and the northerner wondered how someone could waste the effort to brew beer and then make it so bad. The captain walked out the door, her stride showing her determination to finish her mission. They had to get everyone back together and head out of the city. Sigurd needed to take care of himself. The choice of this bar wasn’t an accident. Every thief had a safe house with people as reliable as they could be bought, and this was one of those places that let Sigurd pay for anonymity. With the leader of the thieves dead, Sigurd needed time. The guild members would take days to reorganize as the struggle for power among the lieutenants could become violent. In the end, only one would lead the organization, and Sigurd’s small group had to be gone before someone investigated the violence of the evening. Glancing around the bar to check for unusual actions and unnecessary scrutiny, Sigurd caught the attention of one of the servers. She came over with another beer, which he grabbed from her tray. “Room three available now?” The woman’s face changed from the bright smile of service to the serious look of business. “I’ll check.” She went back to the bar and whispered to the barkeep. The man looked over at Sigurd and sized him up from halfway across the room. The barkeep nodded in the northerner’s direction. His wounds were stiff as Sigurd stood up. The blood was drying and caking on his side, and his shirt stuck to his puckered skin. He grabbed the beer in his fist and made his way up the back stairs. This seedy bar had the extra rooms here for business, not long-term stays. Sigurd ignored the passionate sounds from behind closed doors and paused at door three. He leaned in to listen through the wood as old habits were hard to break. With only the rustle of papers from the other side, he pushed the door open and walked in. “Sigurd, my friend. You look like a pile of horse dung.” A frail woman sat at a mismatched table with an oil lamp and several books. She didn’t bother with the flashy colors of robes and the fine material typical to the capital. Instead, she wore sturdy woolen clothes, including pants tucked into boots. Her smile was crooked and genuine. “Some things don’t change, yes?” “I thought you were a thief, Sigurd…” She raised her wispy body from her seat with a sigh and approached the young man. Hands investigated the wet stain on his side, and wrinkles covered her forehead as she analyzed the bloodstain. The woman didn’t come up halfway up Sigurd’s chest. “And a famous warrior.” “Just not a good one, I see.” Fingers probed the torn skin and redness around the wound. “You almost waited too long, my friend.” “Patch me up? I think I will end up in another fight.” “You should win one now and then.” “You should see the bodies of those that won’t come to you.” “Sigurd, you didn’t.” “I’ll be leaving soon. But I can’t bleed out on the street.” The woman turned back to the chest of drawers by the desk. She motioned him to sit down on the straw mattress. “Might as well sit down, so you don’t fall over.” She removed vials and jars from her supplies.

      "content": "Kincaid - Reunion “Adelaise was looking for us.” Sholeh’s tone was curt and formal with Kincaid. He hated what he’d done to her, but Kincaid couldn’t envision another choice right now. “Will they find us?” “I left a message for our location. We will meet tonight.” “Why are you so mad at me?” Sholeh gave him a stare that forced him to glance away. She stepped closer to force him to face her again. “Look at you. You take these risks with your soul for this magic. Can you not see that we do not need it?” “But I have this power that I had to learn and understand—” “Find something that does not cost your soul. Magic brings imprisonment, loss, and death.” “This is my chance to change that. As I accept these powers, I can discover what I can do—” “Yes, you bring death to others.” Kincaid looked at the floor. “Ignoring this power will not change what I have to do.” “What is that?” A gentle rap sounded at the door, and Kincaid jumped to his feet. He was happy for the distraction to answer the knocking. Sholeh glared at him as he made his way to respond. “Good argument, yes?” Sigurd stood with his hand resting on the frame of the door. He carried his pack, bow, and weapons and strode into the room. Adelaise noticed the distance between Sholeh and Kincaid as she entered the room behind Sigurd. Her eyes shot Sholeh a question, and Kincaid couldn’t decipher the response. “Where did you get the blade, Adelaise?” Sholeh couldn’t take her eyes off the weapon. “Good eye, smith.” “Long story, though. Better over a cold beer. Always better for a story.” Sigurd glanced outside the small room and took up a position as a sentry. “We probably shouldn’t be hanging out as a group,” Kincaid said. “Let’s not pinpoint our location in the first few minutes of our gathering. “Then, I will get the beer.” Sigurd ducked his head and walked down the corridor. “The blade is a family weapon.” “May I?” Sholeh handled the weapon as if she was holding an infant. Her fingers touched the elaborate work on the bell and admired the craftsmanship of the blade. “It is beautiful. Beyond the ability of most masters to craft. It is one of a kind.” “It is unique. With the family—” “Seegeel. New word, yes?” Sigurd returned with four beers and put them near the bed. “Sigil, Sigurd, sigil. The family seal is supposed to be impossible to copy. This blade certainly is.” Sholeh flipped over the sword and examined the pommel. “How do you know?” “I was there when it was forged.” With the steel bared in the light of the room, Kincaid’s attention was drawn toward the blade. The craftsmanship had no equal, but the edge had more beyond his normal sight. In the light of the room, the sword seemed to absorb the light around it, creating darkness along its tempered length. “May I?” Kincaid felt the pommel warm immediately to his touch, inviting him to look closer. The blade was perfect in balance and design, but it was the way the steel absorbed the light that took his breath away. For a moment, he summoned a trickle of magic, and the blade glowed with an inner light only he could see. This was impossible. He returned the sword. “Amazing work, Adelaise. Worth getting back, for sure.” “No leverage to hold over me. Now just have to worry about revenge.” “Seems to be a constant in our lives. Someone always wants revenge for their slights. Which is why we have to talk.” Sholeh refused to grab the mug of beer, and Sigurd shrugged his shoulders while bearing a tankard in each hand. He’d drink them both. “Bartalan will come after me.” “I do not know what this bart-a-laan means.” Sigurd took a long drink from Sholeh’s mug. “The students at one of the schools here,” Kincaid avoided the word magic, “have a gathering to practice their arts. Without the knowledge or supervision of their masters. The leader of the group is a dangerous man, Bartalan. He suspects and now probably knows I have some dark secrets. He’ll do whatever it takes to uncover them.” “Killing you doesn’t make sense, then.” Adelaise focused on their discussion. “No, but he’ll come looking.” “By all that is holy, why?” In those few words, Sholeh unleashed her unspent fury. Sigurd and Adelaise backed away from the confrontation. “Because I broke his spell. His darkest secret and most dangerous power—I defeated it. He’ll want to know how and why. We won’t get out of the city easily, and I don’t prefer to leave that kind of enemy behind us.” The others were silent as they considered his words. None of them could disprove his assessment of magic, and his logic to face this wizard was sound. Even if they wanted to escape, they couldn’t avoid someone with this level of power. “Then what do we do, Kincaid?” Adelaise broke the silence. “Pick a battleground of our choosing and issue the challenge.” “Just like that? I don’t mind the plan, and it’s a good one. But how do we get him to walk into our battlefield?” Adelaise asked. “It’ll be my battlefield, and I know Bartalan well enough that he won’t turn down a chance to learn more. He’ll come prepared.” “Then it won’t be your battleground. It’ll be one we look over and prepare for our purposes.” Sholeh and Sigurd nodded with Adelaise’s words. “But it’ll be a challenge between magi and hecaerae—” “That doesn’t mean we can’t do anything,” Adelaise said. “Steel will still cut them down, yes,” Sigurd added. “Not alone. Not again.” Sholeh’s words were quiet. Tears welled up at the corner of Kincaid’s eyes, and his throat was tight. A blacksmith and a friend. More? An ex-mercenary captain with an unusual blade. And a northerner thief and archer. Accompanying an inexperienced magi. It didn’t seem possible. “I don’t know how we can defeat these student hecaerae. They push their abilities to the edge, and even the schools here don’t know all of their abilities. Bartalan will bring along his most loyal companions if we draw him out into a fight.” “You will have your companions as well, yes?” Sholeh fixed her gaze on Kincaid. She expected an answer. “Yes, we will work together to make sure we can all get out of this city alive. We may have many people chasing us away, but we will escape together.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Setting Conditions",
      "content": "Kincaid - Setting Conditions Kincaid worked his way through the line at the Middle Gate. The guards were methodical and focused on each person in line. Sentries asked several travelers to provide the writs for their weapons, and they pulled aside others for more questioning. Everyone faced an unhappy set of guards. “What brings you the Middle City, traveler?” The guard looked Kincaid up and down with a scowl. “A meeting at the School of Damis.” Kincaid tried to flash a disarming smile, but the guard wasn’t interested. “Don’t look like hecaerae or a student. What’s the purpose of visiting the school?” “I’ve been invited. They want to see if I can become a student.” “Hmm, not sure it works that way.” “I’m not sure how else it would work, to be honest. The forces of magic are beyond most of our understanding. Who am I, a simple carpenter, to question what I might do with the arcane forces?” “That may be true, traveler, but the access to the Middle City isn’t guaranteed.” The charm offensive wasn’t working with the guards, and they’d probably heard similar lines all morning. By afternoon, they’d seen it all. So Kincaid straightened his back and dropped the emotion from his face. “Then we should send a runner forward to the school and make sure I can enter. That assumes, of course, that we are willing to make the group of hecaerae wait for me because of administrative purposes at the gate.” “Not sure that is necessary, traveler.” A more senior member of the guard approached the pair. This one was a corporal and someone Kincaid hoped could decide on his entrance. “Let him through. Give him a blue pass.” Kincaid cocked his head to the side and raised his eyebrows. The guard enjoyed his confusion. “Yes, a blue card. Any member of the watch, guard, or local forces can demand you to present your card. It’s only good for one day, and you’ll return it on the way out. No card means a trip to prison. So don’t lose it.” Kincaid grabbed the parchment and made a show of folding it up and placing it within his cloak. He gave the patrol a half-smile and walked past. The line was barely moving this early in the afternoon. The gates weren’t wide open today. If merchants approached with wagons, the patrol gave the goods a thorough search, and paperwork exchanged hands. Then wagons would wait for one of the wide doors to open to allow them in, and then the doors were closed and secured. Foot travel worked through the smaller doors like the one at nightfall. Something rattled the Middle City, and Kincaid had a good guess that his companions were involved. The guards stopped him on the approach to the door and asked to see his paperwork. After he presented his blue card, Kincaid moved through the gate. The scrutiny leaving the gate was the same as coming in. Kincaid didn’t stay long enough to draw attention to his curiosity about entry and exit procedures, but the guard was serious about catching someone at the gate. Regular traffic would take a while to adapt to the process. The line to get into the Inner City was much shorter. People of power and their retinues didn’t wait long for their clearance to enter, and one of the double doors remained open to allow for smooth transit of carriages and horses. Regular pedestrian traffic faced scrutiny. Each person who looked out of place in the Inner City had to present their card. The attention wasn’t on the Inner City, and Kincaid was relieved. He suspected that if he tried his bluff to have the school verify his entrance, these guards would take him up on that request. And then his plan would come apart. The Inner City was active with traffic moving toward the Imperial Palace. Kincaid didn’t have extensive experience in the Inner City, but he hadn’t witnessed this many people making their way to the center of power. If the Emperor was holding court, that would explain the scrutiny. But the Inner City also had a different energy that even a stranger could sense, unusual for a city known for its systematic bureaucracy and legalistic rules. Kincaid took to the side roads to get off the main thoroughfares. He didn’t need stealth to reach his objective, but he also didn’t want a group of prying eyes sending word ahead. Most importantly, he didn’t want to face Bartalan on the school grounds. He wasn’t prepared for that, and he wouldn’t have the advantage of his companions to even any unexpected odds. The gates to Damis were still open, and a single guard stood at the entrance. The woman wore the colors of the school, but the tunic fit her awkwardly. Definitely new and a different twist to his plan of sending a message without getting caught. He didn’t hesitate as he approached. “Good afternoon, I have a message for hecaerae Darya. Is she available?” “How would I know if a particular person is available?” “Perhaps a runner could send a message on my behalf?” “Do you see a runner around here, visitor?” Kincaid looked around the guard into the courtyard of the school. No one made their way between buildings. “I see you are right. Then how am I to get the message to the hecaerae?” “That falls into the ‘not-my-problem’ category.” “Then, I can enter the campus?” The woman looked him up and down with raised eyebrows. “Yes, you can.” Kincaid walked past the guard. What was the point of having a guard if anyone or everyone could get into the area? Too much of the Inner City was about looks and perceptions of power. Below the surface was a rotten core. The Empire existed on a shaky foundation. The magi walked toward the administration building hoping no one noticed the pounding in his chest. If he touched the arcane plane at this distance from the instructors and the students, they’d know exactly who he was. Bartalan and his peers would recognize his purpose. But they couldn’t read minds. At least Kincaid didn’t think so. A flash or two of magic wouldn’t draw more attention here with the experimentation and classroom instruction already going on. Finding Darya without running across Bartalan was a tough challenge. He’d sent word ahead through a paid messenger to let Darya know that he would be coming back to the school. He’d even risked giving a date and an afternoon as part of his plan, even though a captured message could be the end of his stay in Pilaetium. He’d worried for a full day as no response came back. When he found his courage and settled his companions' fears, he set out to make the meeting arrangements. They couldn’t afford to wait longer. As he stood in front of the administration building, he paused. His plan would immediately fail if Bartalan was working at the desk. His feet wouldn’t move closer to the doors. “Kincaid, is that you?” Kincaid turned toward the voice, and his heart dropped to the bottom of his chest. Karli, one of the female students from the study group, stood in her full hecaerae regalia. The best he could do is smile. “I didn’t think you would ever return here after the beating Bartalan gave you. Are you ok?” “I’m healing.” “The magic he used. It could have killed you.” “Oh, I’m made of tougher material than a few channels of magic. He proved his point, though.” “Then why come back?” “Is Darya around?” The concerned look changed to quiet amusement. “Back for a girl?” Kincaid’s cheeks heated past a healthy pink, and he couldn’t keep the stammer out of his voice. “In a way, I guess so.” “Bartalan’s in class. Let me get her, and then you should leave before he sees you again.” “Thank you, Karli.” Kincaid stepped backward, away from the doors. He leaned his back against the stones of the outer wall and stayed in the lengthening afternoon shadows. In a few moments, the sound of hurrying footsteps came from the other side of the building. Two women came around the corner, and Kincaid breathed a sigh of relief they were alone. “Kincaid…” Darya hurried forward and came to a stop in front of him. She changed her mind and threw her arms around him. Kincaid was surprised but then returned the embrace. Darya had a fragrance of fresh flowers, and her warmth flooded his being. He didn’t release her as he looked into her eyes. “You didn’t return my message. I was afraid I would walk up here and be arrested.” “For what? You’ve done nothing against the school.” “But Bartalan—” “Doesn’t have as much influence as you think.” “He certainly has a great deal of power.” Kincaid rubbed the healing bruises on his face. “We shouldn’t stay here, though.” “It was good seeing you, Kincaid.” Karli left them alone as she turned and walked to one of the academic buildings. Kincaid shot the guard a glance as he walked out the gate with the hecaerae. The see-I-told-you-so look was ignored by the guard, and Kincaid kept moving down the street. “There’s so much going on, Kincaid.” “I can imagine. Those of us living down in the Outer City don’t get to hear much. Especially after being thrown into a gutter and left in the sewage.” That was harsher than the magi intended, even if everything was true. Darya worked her mouth and then closed it. Her footsteps became firm as they walked side-by-side. “I’m sorry, Darya. Coming back to the school wasn’t as easy as I thought. When you didn’t answer, I assumed the worst.” “You are right, Kincaid. Bartalan has it out for you, and we all stood by and let him. I don’t have an excuse.” “None required. But I need your help. I need to face Bartalan.” “He’ll kill you.” Kincaid smiled and reached out to hold her hand. The warmth of her touch felt good in his palm, and he gave her a reassuring squeeze. “I don’t plan on giving him that opportunity.” “That wave of magic was you.” Respect glowed in her eyes. “Yes. Desperation can fuel some incredible efforts. I couldn’t let him cut me off from the arcane plane. I won’t let him.” “You should see him, Kincaid. How much he’s aged. The magic is claiming him.” “He’s talked about the consequences of magic. He knows them as well as the rest of us.” “But you look the same, Kincaid. Maybe a few more gray hairs on your head, but nothing like Bartalan.” “He’s the one using his magic for show and then cutting off others from the arcane plane. I figured out that he needed to maintain a flow to isolate someone. He was burning through his life to keep others from living theirs. Not an admirable man.” “But a dangerous one, Kincaid. You should just leave the city.” Her touch felt good. There once was a time in Caesea that he would disappear with her. They’d forget their place in the world. But he didn’t have that luxury now, and Sholeh’s smile crossed his mind. “I have to leave behind the city—” “Agents of the Emperor have been in the schools looking for the red-haired magi.” Kincaid stopped in his tracks and turned to face her. “How does the Emperor know about me? After everything that Bartalan did, I shouldn’t have recovered.” “But you did, and the Emperor is aware of a powerful force of unaligned magic within the heart of his Empire. If you were somewhere else in the Empire, the news would take time to get to us. But you are here, blocks away from the palace.” Lazy guards and slow bureaucracy saved him from imprisonment. He was separated from his companions, and the threat had never been greater in his life. Caesea was a joke compared to what this Empire could do to him. What to do next? His body screamed to run away from all of this. Take their chances on the road and fight their enemies one at a time, if they were found. But his mind fought back with reason. Bartalan wouldn’t let him walk away from this city. He was probably the one who slipped the word to the Empire's agents about what he could do. Passion and reason fought for Kincaid’s soul, even as the power of magic begged for a touch. “I need you to get a message to Bartalan. I need to have a discussion with him. If he brings guards or help, then I will be gone.” “Kincaid, you can’t do this. He’ll kill you for what you know.” “Then he’ll learn nothing from me.” “The school is mad at him, Kincaid. They want to hold a board of inquisition about his behavior. The student group hasn’t formed since he attacked you.” “Interesting, so he has a great deal more to lose—\" “He’s blaming it on you.” “That’s ok. He’s the type who will never face accountability for his own actions. I imagine he’s ready to lead a coup from within the school.” “The grand master and the fifth rank wizards are watching for exactly that. They are noting his collection of friends and people of interest. This doesn’t end well for him.” “I don’t want the school banishing him, and I don’t want the Empire or the hecaerae breathing down my neck.” “Then what will you do?” “I need you to pass a message to my good friend, Bartalan.”",

      "content": "Kincaid - Setting Conditions Kincaid worked his way through the line at the Middle Gate. The guards were methodical and focused on each person in line. Sentries asked several travelers to provide the writs for their weapons, and they pulled aside others for more questioning. Everyone faced an unhappy set of guards. “What brings you the Middle City, traveler?” The guard looked Kincaid up and down with a scowl. “A meeting at the School of Damis.” Kincaid tried to flash a disarming smile, but the guard wasn’t interested. “Don’t look like hecaerae or a student. What’s the purpose of visiting the school?” “I’ve been invited. They want to see if I can become a student.” “Hmm, not sure it works that way.” “I’m not sure how else it would work, to be honest. The forces of magic are beyond most of our understanding. Who am I, a simple carpenter, to question what I might do with the arcane forces?” “That may be true, traveler, but the access to the Middle City isn’t guaranteed.” The charm offensive wasn’t working with the guards, and they’d probably heard similar lines all morning. By afternoon, they’d seen it all. So Kincaid straightened his back and dropped the emotion from his face. “Then we should send a runner forward to the school and make sure I can enter. That assumes, of course, that we are willing to make the group of hecaerae wait for me because of administrative purposes at the gate.” “Not sure that is necessary, traveler.” A more senior member of the guard approached the pair. This one was a corporal and someone Kincaid hoped could decide on his entrance. “Let him through. Give him a blue pass.” Kincaid cocked his head to the side and raised his eyebrows. The guard enjoyed his confusion. “Yes, a blue card. Any member of the watch, guard, or local forces can demand you to present your card. It’s only good for one day, and you’ll return it on the way out. No card means a trip to prison. So don’t lose it.” Kincaid grabbed the parchment and made a show of folding it up and placing it within his cloak. He gave the patrol a half-smile and walked past. The line was barely moving this early in the afternoon. The gates weren’t wide open today. If merchants approached with wagons, the patrol gave the goods a thorough search, and paperwork exchanged hands. Then wagons would wait for one of the wide doors to open to allow them in, and then the doors were closed and secured. Foot travel worked through the smaller doors like the one at nightfall. Something rattled the Middle City, and Kincaid had a good guess that his companions were involved. The guards stopped him on the approach to the door and asked to see his paperwork. After he presented his blue card, Kincaid moved through the gate. The scrutiny leaving the gate was the same as coming in. Kincaid didn’t stay long enough to draw attention to his curiosity about entry and exit procedures, but the guard was serious about catching someone at the gate. Regular traffic would take a while to adapt to the process. The line to get into the Inner City was much shorter. People of power and their retinues didn’t wait long for their clearance to enter, and one of the double doors remained open to allow for smooth transit of carriages and horses. Regular pedestrian traffic faced scrutiny. Each person who looked out of place in the Inner City had to present their card. The attention wasn’t on the Inner City, and Kincaid was relieved. He suspected that if he tried his bluff to have the school verify his entrance, these guards would take him up on that request. And then his plan would come apart. The Inner City was active with traffic moving toward the Imperial Palace. Kincaid didn’t have extensive experience in the Inner City, but he hadn’t witnessed this many people making their way to the center of power. If the Emperor was holding court, that would explain the scrutiny. But the Inner City also had a different energy that even a stranger could sense, unusual for a city known for its systematic bureaucracy and legalistic rules. Kincaid took to the side roads to get off the main thoroughfares. He didn’t need stealth to reach his objective, but he also didn’t want a group of prying eyes sending word ahead. Most importantly, he didn’t want to face Bartalan on the school grounds. He wasn’t prepared for that, and he wouldn’t have the advantage of his companions to even any unexpected odds. The gates to Damis were still open, and a single guard stood at the entrance. The woman wore the colors of the school, but the tunic fit her awkwardly. Definitely new and a different twist to his plan of sending a message without getting caught. He didn’t hesitate as he approached. “Good afternoon, I have a message for hecaerae Darya. Is she available?” “How would I know if a particular person is available?” “Perhaps a runner could send a message on my behalf?” “Do you see a runner around here, visitor?” Kincaid looked around the guard into the courtyard of the school. No one made their way between buildings. “I see you are right. Then how am I to get the message to the hecaerae?” “That falls into the ‘not-my-problem’ category.” “Then, I can enter the campus?” The woman looked him up and down with raised eyebrows. “Yes, you can.” Kincaid walked past the guard. What was the point of having a guard if anyone or everyone could get into the area? Too much of the Inner City was about looks and perceptions of power. Below the surface was a rotten core. The Empire existed on a shaky foundation. The magi walked toward the administration building hoping no one noticed the pounding in his chest. If he touched the arcane plane at this distance from the instructors and the students, they’d know exactly who he was. Bartalan and his peers would recognize his purpose. But they couldn’t read minds. At least Kincaid didn’t think so. A flash or two of magic wouldn’t draw more attention here with the experimentation and classroom instruction already going on. Finding Darya without running across Bartalan was a tough challenge. He’d sent word ahead through a paid messenger to let Darya know that he would be coming back to the school. He’d even risked giving a date and an afternoon as part of his plan, even though a captured message could be the end of his stay in Pilaetium. He’d worried for a full day as no response came back. When he found his courage and settled his companions' fears, he set out to make the meeting arrangements. They couldn’t afford to wait longer. As he stood in front of the administration building, he paused. His plan would immediately fail if Bartalan was working at the desk. His feet wouldn’t move closer to the doors. “Kincaid, is that you?” Kincaid turned toward the voice, and his heart dropped to the bottom of his chest. Karli, one of the female students from the study group, stood in her full hecaerae regalia. The best he could do is smile. “I didn’t think you would ever return here after the beating Bartalan gave you. Are you ok?” “I’m healing.” “The magic he used. It could have killed you.” “Oh, I’m made of tougher material than a few channels of magic. He proved his point, though.” “Then why come back?” “Is Darya around?” The concerned look changed to quiet amusement. “Back for a girl?” Kincaid’s cheeks heated past a healthy pink, and he couldn’t keep the stammer out of his voice. “In a way, I guess so.” “Bartalan’s in class. Let me get her, and then you should leave before he sees you again.” “Thank you, Karli.” Kincaid stepped backward, away from the doors. He leaned his back against the stones of the outer wall and stayed in the lengthening afternoon shadows. In a few moments, the sound of hurrying footsteps came from the other side of the building. Two women came around the corner, and Kincaid breathed a sigh of relief they were alone. “Kincaid…” Darya hurried forward and came to a stop in front of him. She changed her mind and threw her arms around him. Kincaid was surprised but then returned the embrace. Darya had a fragrance of fresh flowers, and her warmth flooded his being.

      "content": "Sholeh - Last Chances Coming back to Pilaetium was a mistake. Sholeh looked out the window and fingered the haft of her hammers. Patrols from the watch were double their standard size and armed with mail and heavy weapons. The watch expected trouble. She had to assume their group was part of the reason for the change in operations and readiness. The smith stepped away from the window before her observation brought unnecessary attention. She wished she could explain to Kincaid why coming to the heart of the Empire was a mistake. The magic he’d learned threatened his life again, and she was on the run from the church. Sigurd and Adelaise had their own list of powerful enemies. Taken together, Sholeh was concerned their problems exceeded their challenges in Caesea. She paced the small floor of their room as she waited for Kincaid to return from his trip to the Inner City. Increased security threatened his mission, and a misstep with the hecaerae would force a rescue mission against impossible odds. Everything was wrong about staying in the capital and pushing one last agenda. Her heart was unsettled with their chances of survival. A soft rap at the door caused Sholeh to palm a hammer. Heart pounding through her veins, she stepped to the side. Sholeh cursed herself for her silliness. If someone wanted to ambush her, they wouldn’t knock first. She responded with a low summons but kept the hammer in her hand. She breathed a sigh of relief with the redhead who bobbed into the room. His eyes were bright and energetic as he locked gazes with her. His face lost its youthful softness months ago with his discovery of magic. Instead of dimples and soft cheeks, he wore the hard angles of work, and the concern lines around his eyes were growing deeper. For all his power, magic still demanded a profound toll on the young man. But how young was he now? And how much more would magic ask from him as they undertook this next stage? Sholeh didn’t like how they approached confrontation with another magician. She’d seen enough destruction from the last effort to want to convince her friend to stay away from these wizards. “It’s done.” “By all that is holy, you are sure?” “As sure as I can be without grabbing a gauntlet and slapping him across the face.” “Tell Sigurd and Adelaise?” “Adelaise is clearing the street near the inn to see if anyone tried to follow me, and Sigurd is guarding the main entrance. They know I’m here, and I’m sure they assume I was successful.” Sholeh nodded her acceptance and swallowed hard. “We can still leave. Before it is too late.” Her voice was above a whisper, as if she was afraid to betray the young man’s plans. Foolish thoughts; they’d been over this already. “I just don’t see it that way, Sholeh.” He pulled off his cloak and went to his bed, just a gathering of straw on the creaky wooden floor. Kincaid slid to the floor as the smile evaporated from his face. He winced as he caught a splinter on his back. “We risk people finding us here in town, and you have revealed to a school of wizards what you plan on doing.” Sholeh controlled the volume of her voice. “Sholeh, we’ve been at risk for a long time. Tell me about the church.” Kincaid’s eyes cut through the fog of her deception, and his gaze was unrelenting. “It is a long story, my friend.” “We have some time, and I think we should have this discussion before Sigurd and Adelaise come back.” He raised his hand and gestured toward the other pile of straw. She refused to sit. “You know I left the city, even after I started my apprenticeship with the blacksmiths.” “You told me you had to start over again in Caesea, but you moved up the ranks quickly in your forge. The master there liked your work and saw you could also lead the younger apprentices.” “All very true, but I had to leave Pilaetium for several reasons.” Kincaid leaned forward and dug the splinter out of his backside. He stayed quiet to let her continue. Sholeh pulled in a long breath and blinked hard to keep the memories from overwhelming her emotions. “My father didn’t want me to become a blacksmith.” “What did he expect you to do?” “Marry within the church.” Kincaid sat silently, and Sholeh couldn’t determine if he was stunned with her simple sentence or if he was waiting for more from her. He waited. “The power struggles place high demands on the sons and daughters in the capital. People wear their rank as part of their fashion. Most are prominent with their displays of wealth and fashion. Children are part of their calculus.” “The Northern States doesn’t seem to have that problem.” “Because they spend too much time at war with each other. None of the rulers bother with intricate power struggles like Pilaetium. We make it an art and a game. The Northern States resort to war when things don’t go their way.” “What happens here?” “They wait for another generation to get their revenge. The Empire has grown for over a thousand years, and the Thousand Spears are less important than ever within the city.” “You were a pawn to make your father more powerful?” “Yes.” “What did your mother think?” “She opposed it, of course. My mother raised a strong daughter who was not easily shaped for marital purposes. Steel is strong and deadly in the right hands. I didn’t want to be traded for political favors.” “But pushed in the wrong direction, steel can snap.” Sholeh blinked away the unbidden tears in the corner of her eyes. She wouldn’t cry here over the choices she made long ago. “She helped me get the apprenticeship with the blacksmiths. My father was furious with the contract I signed. And things went worse from there.” “Why does this affect us so much today?” “Because my father knows I am back in the city, and I do not have a contract limiting my availability.” Kincaid put his hands on the floor and clutched piles of straw. “It’s been, what, four years?” “Close enough, yes. But I am still very eligible.” “Over my dead body.” Sholeh’s heart skipped a beat even as she knew what he meant. The threat to her was real, and it affected him personally. But she couldn’t have a war of wizards and the church. Even if it was only one wizard. They’d lose. “It is dangerous for us to stay in the city, Kincaid. When Sigurd and Adelaise rescued me in the stonecutter’s yard, we should have left.” “We’re not staying. We have something to do.” “But at what cost? To all of us?” “Have you seen your mother or your father since you have been back?” The question wasn’t sent with an accusation, but it hit her square in the heart. “No, I have not seen anyone in my family.” “They know you are here?” “Yes.” “So, what now?” “We make our stand against your wizard, and we leave the place behind. The Empire is no longer safe for any of us.” “I wish you told me earlier.” “Tell you the tragic story about my escape from the capital and the choices my parents forced upon me? Why would I want to do that with the young man who always had plans to take on the world and become a great hero? The man who would be the youngest to become a master of the carpentry guild in a generation? That young man inspired me to great things, and the shadows of the past were always behind me with the bright sun leading me forward.” “I wished I asked, then.” “I would not have answered those questions, even had you knew enough to ask about them. This city was behind me.” “Then why didn’t you say anything when I said we should come here after Caesea?” Sholeh had to think about that answer. Why did she take the risk to come back to Pilaetium? For Kincaid, for sure. He needed to know more about the magic he could control. For herself, maybe so. Unfinished business around the Empire. There was a kernel of curiosity in her heart about her family and the state of affairs. Those questions were answered. “I did it for you, Kincaid. This was the answer to the moments that changed your life. The schools of magic offered you what you needed, and you honored Cormac’s dying wishes. How could I say no?” “Because you risked everything to come back here.” “Not everything. Some things are worth fighting for, my friend. And we picked up two new vagabonds to join our group of misfits.” “The Empire may regret this group of misfits bonding within the confines of Pilaetium.”",

None of the rulers bother with intricate power struggles like Pilaetium. We make it an art and a game. The Northern States resort to war when things don’t go their way.” “What happens here?” “They wait for another generation to get their revenge. The Empire has grown for over a thousand years, and the Thousand Spears are less important than ever within the city.” “You were a pawn to make your father more powerful?” “Yes.” “What did your mother think?” “She opposed it, of course. My mother raised a strong daughter who was not easily shaped for marital purposes. Steel is strong and deadly in the right hands. I didn’t want to be traded for political favors.” “But pushed in the wrong direction, steel can snap.” Sholeh blinked away the unbidden tears in the corner of her eyes. She wouldn’t cry here over the choices she made long ago. “She helped me get the apprenticeship with the blacksmiths. My father was furious with the contract I signed. And things went worse from there.” “Why does this affect us so much today?” “Because my father knows I am back in the city, and I do not have a contract limiting my availability.” Kincaid put his hands on the floor and clutched piles of straw. “It’s been, what, four years?” “Close enough, yes. But I am still very eligible.” “Over my dead body.” Sholeh’s heart skipped a beat even as she knew what he meant. The threat to her was real, and it affected him personally. But she couldn’t have a war of wizards and the church. Even if it was only one wizard. They’d lose. “It is dangerous for us to stay in the city, Kincaid. When Sigurd and Adelaise rescued me in the stonecutter’s yard, we should have left.” “We’re not staying. We have something to do.” “But at what cost? To all of us?” “Have you seen your mother or your father since you have been back?” The question wasn’t sent with an accusation, but it hit her square in the heart. “No, I have not seen anyone in my family.” “They know you are here?” “Yes.” “So, what now?” “We make our stand against your wizard, and we leave the place behind. The Empire is no longer safe for any of us.” “I wish you told me earlier.” “Tell you the tragic story about my escape from the capital and the choices my parents forced upon me? Why would I want to do that with the young man who always had plans to take on the world and become a great hero? The man who would be the youngest to become a master of the carpentry guild in a generation? That young man inspired me to great things, and the shadows of the past were always behind me with the bright sun leading me forward.” “I wished I asked, then.” “I would not have answered those questions, even had you knew enough to ask about them. This city was behind me.” “Then why didn’t you say anything when I said we should come here after Caesea?” Sholeh had to think about that answer. Why did she take the risk to come back to Pilaetium? For Kincaid, for sure. He needed to know more about the magic he could control. For herself, maybe so. Unfinished business around the Empire. There was a kernel of curiosity in her heart about her family and the state of affairs. Those questions were answered. “I did it for you, Kincaid. This was the answer to the moments that changed your life. The schools of magic offered you what you needed, and you honored Cormac’s dying wishes. How could I say no?” “Because you risked everything to come back here.” “Not everything. Some things are worth fighting for, my friend. And we picked up two new vagabonds to join our group of misfits.” “The Empire may regret this group of misfits bonding within the confines of Pilaetium.”",

      "content": "Kincaid - Showdown Stonecutters cleaned up rock fragments and secured their tools. Masons washed away the excess mortar and stacked the remaining stones for another day’s labor. None of the men and women paid attention as Kincaid walked the length of the unfinished wall. Their day was done. The warmth and company of the Outer City beckoned these laborers. The labor was exhausting, but each stone laid in this wall was a visible cue for the work they’d finished. People in power couldn’t see the results of their decisions, and their work may take years or even a generation to see the outcome. Workers saw the results every day. The work of their hands was there for all to see. Being a magi was a blend of the two. When he used his magic, the results were in front of his eyes. The impact was all around them with the most subtle magic or the most powerful blasts. But the games of magic were like the struggles of the powerful. The cues were faint, and the results often undetermined for years. If a wizard could live long enough to see them. Kincaid couldn’t afford an uncertain outcome today. If Bartalan guessed his secret, the world would change. The magi had no doubt the streets would fill with bodies as Bartalan surged to the highest reaches of power. He wouldn’t control himself. Who was he to talk? Kincaid felt the frail souls of the sick and dying swirling at the edge of his own soul. He’d killed more than he could count for an advantage in this battle. His hands weren’t clean, and his conscience was dark with his decisions. His soul bore the price of his choices one way or another. Sholeh talked with a few of the stonecutters. She didn’t stray far from his side, and Kincaid admired her connection with these workers. He was once like that, one with a workforce. But she was an angel to them. A messenger of hope that they could make it through another day with hard work and chip away at the bonds of their own life. They could dream of a new place. He remembered when she was that way for him. Kincaid didn’t search the rooftops for Sigurd. He assumed the man would climb to find the best perch. Against a wizard, being on a roof was a dangerous location. But Sigurd was convinced that people don’t tend to look up, only focusing on what is in front of their face. Kincaid couldn’t talk him out of it, so he didn’t try. Adelaise worked the side streets, stalking in the shadows with her weapons, ready for work. She would be a wild card in the upcoming fight. If she could get close, she’d be deadly. But Kincaid wasn’t confident the captain would get a chance with her blades. Kincaid had to make sure the fight centered on himself, and he finished this confrontation the right way. They wouldn’t have a force chasing them across the world looking for his secrets. A surge of magic raised the hairs on Kincaid’s forearms. Another followed. And then more. Take your place as their leader. Establish your position as their master and claim the school for your own. The voice wasn’t a booming echo anymore. It was subtle, insistent, and clear. The command threw Kincaid’s stride off as he considered the words. He wasn’t in the Outer City anymore. People cutting stone were a distant memory, and the nobility of the Empire gathered in a magnificent hall. Not just any hall, the audience chamber of the Grand Palace of Pilaetium. Wealth gleamed from every corner of the room, and the voices were hushed. Kincaid rose from the cushioned throne. The gems glittered in the light, gold shone with its polish, and purple silks brushed against his skin. Nobles, merchants, hecaerae, and masters bent a knee and bowed their heads. None resisted him. A surge of power flooded his lungs and allowed his voice to carry across the room. “Bring the diplomats forward.” The command was Kincaid’s voice, and he was in the room. But he wasn’t. His mind fought against the strange differences what his eyes could see but his logic challenged. The golden doors swung into the room. A platoon of guards in breastplates and flowing cloaks escorted the person into the room. Attius Atros walked in. Not as the arrogant Duke of Caesea. Instead, he was a bowed supplicant ready to surrender his city to the power and might of a king. No, a new emperor. An emperor of emperors. This is yours. This is why you came to the Empire of a Thousand Spears. Kincaid struggled against the voice seeping into his soul. A part of his mind registered the raging tide of magic threatening his being, but he relished the moment and cherished the thought of power. He looked to the golden chair to his right, and the cushioned expanse was empty. His heartbeat stopped for a moment, knowing he was missing an essential part of his life. Someone should be there. If he could remember. He glanced at his advisers, looking for faces he could recognize. Smiling sycophants stood around him and nodded their faked appreciation for his generosity. Guards faced the gathered crowd and ignored the Emperor standing at his lonely throne. The group stayed on their knees, waiting for a command. A command Kincaid couldn’t give. His mind wrestled control back from the image, and the voice whispered words he could no longer understand. His forearm hurt. Sholeh looked him in the eyes. Lines on her face etched with worry. This wasn’t their plan. She talked to him, and he forced his mind to listen. “He wants your answer.” Kincaid blinked away the vision and fought to control the magic within. He noticed the power around him, surging in the gathering of hecaerae from Damis and even two from Theurgia. Bartalan. His half smile covered his face, and his arrogance was backed up by the power of his magic and the four hecaerae standing behind him. “So, this is the blacksmith the church is looking for. You should think twice about your next options, Kincaid.” This wasn’t their plan. Their simple setup to reach an agreement and fight only if necessary was gone. His agenda to wage the fight alone, if necessary, was now a dream. One that would turn into a nightmare. “What options do you see, Bartalan?” “Are you deaf?” “No, too busy imagining you kneeling before me, begging for forgiveness.” “That’s how you see this happening, chronomancer?” “If I did, you should be scared.” The man standing in front of him lost his youth to the corruption of magic. Gray sprinkled through his hair, and lines radiated from the corners of his eyes. Wrinkles graced the back of his hands. The years were not kind. “You have much to tell us, magi. We should go to a bar and discuss over a good beverage.” The sickly smile dripped with a faked appreciation of his position. “I’m done discussing with you, Bartalan. Don’t make me show you what happens in your future.” The gathered hecaerae looked toward one another. Kincaid didn’t know what their leader offered them, but the Theurgians didn’t look like they wanted part of a magical storm building before their eyes. Magic was everywhere around them, but their focus was on the pair in the middle. “You connect with magic stronger than ever, magi. How did you do it?” “Bartalan, you had to maintain your power to keep me separated from the arcane plane, didn’t you?” The gathering of hecaerae looked more uncertain. Even the Theurgians must know about Bartalan’s unique ability with magic. Sholeh stepped to the side and had a hammer in each hand now. “I did. I wanted you to feel despair and know the depths of your darkness.” “Looks like you found your own. I imagine you break a mirror every time you gaze into its depths now.” “How?” “I had to understand what you were doing, probe with my senses. If I had never touched magic before, you would have been successful. But I am a magi, and your power wasn’t complete.” “That’s not all, is there?” Kincaid felt the souls stir in his consciousness. No, that would never be all with this man. He’d want more. And there were many others like him. Kincaid twisted the flow of magic and looked at the ghosts of the future. The magi stepped in close, only inches away from his nose. “There are secrets of magic no one should know. I’ll carry that curse alone.” Magic flared with a red light. Bartalan lashed out with the power raging in his soul, but Kincaid was already in motion. The ghostly images showed Bartalan’s rage turning to explosive lances of fire from his fingertips. The heat singed his clothes, and the stolen souls wailed at the power surging through his veins. But he wasn’t in the place where the shots were aimed. The surge of magic allowed the magi to move somehow faster. Or at least with enough warning to get away from the targeted area. Kincaid pushed the circle of power around him, watching the path of the future shape the events around Sholeh. She’d be safe for a few more moments. The other wizards would recover from their shock soon enough. “Did you see that?” one of the accompanying hecaerae asked. His voice was shrill with the magic exploding around them. “He doesn’t age like the rest of us,” although the voice was low, Kincaid could hear the tone clearly with his augmented senses. The Theurgian hecaerae was being pulled into Bartalan’s circle of influence. The fight was going to be brutal. Bartalan clenched his jaw and ground his teeth. The flow of magic raged inside the man, and Kincaid’s senses felt all of it. With the power in this part of the city, every wizard would know of mages' duel. And this was one reason Kincaid chose this spot. None would have the time to intervene, even if they could figure out what was going on. The angry hecaerae pulled in more magic and slammed an area around Kincaid. This wasn’t flame, gravity, or illusion. Instead, Bartalan tried to sever Kincaid’s touch with the arcane plane. Their wills battled. Magic fought magic, and the pair stood motionless. Kincaid felt his grip on magic falter, and his will longed for a deeper pull of magic to counteract the rushing waterfall of energy surging against him. He chose to stop fighting. Magic slashed through his remaining control, and Bartalan took the first step toward him. His face glowed with power even as it aged. His eyes were alight with victory, and his posture was the arrogance of conquest. Kincaid stood quietly. The first snap of a bow broke the stillness of the air. Eyes hunted for the deadly dark shape, but none knew the location of the shot. Until it hit the first Theurgian in the throat. The arrow tore through the neck of the hecaerae and splattered the nearby Theurgian with gore. Hands flailed at the injury for a moment before life slipped away from the body. Blood trickled toward the grooves in the cobblestone. Magic raged everywhere as shields surged for defense. But for one of the other hecaerae, the shield was a moment too late. Adelaise’s family blade was a dark flash in the sunlight. The imperfect arcane shield surrendered to the surgical blow from an unexpected direction. The tip of the sword went for the heart. With a flick, the blade was back out as another body hit the ground. “Not just magic here, Bartalan.” “No, but mine is, and you’ll tell me your secrets.” Sholeh was also in motion now. She pulled back her arm and launched her hammer from her right hand, and Bartalan couldn’t ignore the heavy projectile aimed for his chest. With a wave of his hand, an arcane surge flashed and slammed the hammer to the ground. Kincaid longed to touch the arcane plane, but he needed Bartalan to stay focused on him. He wielded enough power to kill each of his companions without a stray thought. His opponent was dangerous enough to do whatever his mind willed, and that was Kincaid’s role in the plan. Another arrow crossed the distance from the rooftop, but this arrow exploded against a shield of magic. Blue sparks danced and splattered across stones. This shot was enough for the last Damithian to note the location. Adelaise was still in motion as she closed the gap with the last Theurgian. Her blades were clutched in each hand and held low for an attack. The female wizard didn’t show signs of concern for the deadly mercenary’s approach. In a flash of magic, light bent around the hecaerae. She disappeared from view. The plan just got harder if they lost track of the wizards in the fight. Bartalan was the most important, but any of them could be deadly. Kincaid lost his sense of confidence, and the arcane plane beckoned his strength, just beyond the boundary Bartalan maintained between them. Kincaid glanced at the location of his companions. Bartalan laughed. “No plan will work against this collection of hecaerae.” “Students. Just students.” “Practitioners, magi. Each one of us has special skills, and any can kill you all.” “But you aren’t here to kill me. You want something.” “I do. But your friends don’t figure into our calculus. We only need you to survive.” The man kept walking forward to confront Kincaid. Even separated from his magic, Kincaid sensed the power grappling with the man’s soul. The flow was a torrent of energy, and time was not treating the man well. He would risk everything to know what Kincaid knew. Sholeh came from behind a low wall with her hammer swinging hard at Bartalan’s head. The power of years of smithing was behind the sure blow, but the hammer exploded into fragments as it struck an arcane shield around him. The young smith’s body flung back nearly four yards and collapsed in the empty street. She struggled to get back to her feet. “You care about this one. Very good.” With a wave of his hand, Bartalan summoned another flow of magic. “You’ll remember this.” Sholeh’s body flattened to the ground, and she groaned under the pressure of the invisible attack. Kincaid didn’t hold back. He severed the separating boundary to the arcane plane with a stolen soul, and magic came back to him in a rush. Bartalan’s eyes flung wide even as his pupils glowed with a deep blue. “You do not have the power to separate me from the arcane plane, hecaerae. No one can. Release her.” Kincaid twisted another soul to look into the future at the images of what could be. Lances of arcane magic were aimed at Adelaise, lightning flashed from the heavens toward Sigurd, and Bartalan’s power crushed Sholeh. And Bartalan gloated over his victory. In a rage of power, Kincaid twisted his stolen souls in the other direction. The images stopped. Everything stopped. The souls were starting to pop out of existence into oblivion like corn kernels near a fire. Kincaid used magic to pull Adelaise out of the way of the blast, push Sigurd to the side, and hide Sholeh from the energy crushing her. He will destroy everything you love. There is only one way out of this. The voice was insistent and impossible to ignore. Images of the city aflame stoked the imagination in his mind. The emperor waited for him on bended knee. The world waited for his arrival. No. Kincaid released his control on time and let the events flow. Arcane blasts ripped through the air and missed a surprised Adelaise. Lightning crackled and singed a confused Sigurd. And Sholeh’s body was moved out of the area of gravity crushing her. Kincaid knew he didn’t have much magic left in this fight before it took its terrible toll on his soul. But he couldn’t think of a better cause than to take care of his friends. He brought them into this. With a flash of arcane energy, Kincaid snapped across the distance to Sigurd’s target. The magi's arrival stunned the student for a moment as he turned to face a new threat. Kincaid opened the ground at the man’s feet. The man jumped into the air and formed a cushion of air. He bared his teeth in an otherworldly grin at Kincaid’s effort. But he missed the intent of the movement. Sigurd took the shot, and the arrow slammed into the man. Floating on an air pocket, the man took the impact of the projectile against his shield. Even though the missile couldn’t punch through the defense, the impact was enough to send the floating man spinning several yards away. More arrows followed the path. Spinning out of control, the man gave up his cushion of air and collapsed to the ground. Except the field became another hole that buried the man alive. With a crushing push, Kincaid snapped the life out of the man before he could react. Adelaise was in a fight for her life. She was fast, and her blades hunted for a target. But the invisible opponent didn’t give her an opening for an attack. At least any movement was sufficient for Adelaise’s trained reaction to respond to sounds. Even the shuffling of feet was enough to drive the female wizard back. Kincaid launched a small fireball from his hands. The blast rippled against the power around the invisible hecaerae’s shield, revealing the unseen location. Adelaise launched a flurry of attacks against the woman. The family blade was a dark streak in Kincaid’s eyes. The blade tore through the magical shields and brought a stream of blood and a surprised yelp from the attack. The darkness surged in Adelaise’s hands. In a moment, the last student was down. Kincaid turned back to Bartalan to see the man clutching Sholeh’s throat.",

This shot was enough for the last Damithian to note the location. Adelaise was still in motion as she closed the gap with the last Theurgian. Her blades were clutched in each hand and held low for an attack. The female wizard didn’t show signs of concern for the deadly mercenary’s approach. In a flash of magic, light bent around the hecaerae. She disappeared from view. The plan just got harder if they lost track of the wizards in the fight. Bartalan was the most important, but any of them could be deadly. Kincaid lost his sense of confidence, and the arcane plane beckoned his strength, just beyond the boundary Bartalan maintained between them. Kincaid glanced at the location of his companions. Bartalan laughed. “No plan will work against this collection of hecaerae.” “Students. Just students.” “Practitioners, magi. Each one of us has special skills, and any can kill you all.” “But you aren’t here to kill me. You want something.” “I do. But your friends don’t figure into our calculus. We only need you to survive.” The man kept walking forward to confront Kincaid. Even separated from his magic, Kincaid sensed the power grappling with the man’s soul. The flow was a torrent of energy, and time was not treating the man well. He would risk everything to know what Kincaid knew. Sholeh came from behind a low wall with her hammer swinging hard at Bartalan’s head. The power of years of smithing was behind the sure blow, but the hammer exploded into fragments as it struck an arcane shield around him. The young smith’s body flung back nearly four yards and collapsed in the empty street. She struggled to get back to her feet. “You care about this one. Very good.” With a wave of his hand, Bartalan summoned another flow of magic. “You’ll remember this.” Sholeh’s body flattened to the ground, and she groaned under the pressure of the invisible attack. Kincaid didn’t hold back. He severed the separating boundary to the arcane plane with a stolen soul, and magic came back to him in a rush. Bartalan’s eyes flung wide even as his pupils glowed with a deep blue. “You do not have the power to separate me from the arcane plane, hecaerae. No one can. Release her.” Kincaid twisted another soul to look into the future at the images of what could be. Lances of arcane magic were aimed at Adelaise, lightning flashed from the heavens toward Sigurd, and Bartalan’s power crushed Sholeh. And Bartalan gloated over his victory. In a rage of power, Kincaid twisted his stolen souls in the other direction. The images stopped. Everything stopped. The souls were starting to pop out of existence into oblivion like corn kernels near a fire. Kincaid used magic to pull Adelaise out of the way of the blast, push Sigurd to the side, and hide Sholeh from the energy crushing her. He will destroy everything you love. There is only one way out of this. The voice was insistent and impossible to ignore. Images of the city aflame stoked the imagination in his mind. The emperor waited for him on bended knee. The world waited for his arrival. No. Kincaid released his control on time and let the events flow. Arcane blasts ripped through the air and missed a surprised Adelaise. Lightning crackled and singed a confused Sigurd. And Sholeh’s body was moved out of the area of gravity crushing her. Kincaid knew he didn’t have much magic left in this fight before it took its terrible toll on his soul. But he couldn’t think of a better cause than to take care of his friends. He brought them into this. With a flash of arcane energy, Kincaid snapped across the distance to Sigurd’s target. The magi's arrival stunned the student for a moment as he turned to face a new threat. Kincaid opened the ground at the man’s feet. The man jumped into the air and formed a cushion of air. He bared his teeth in an otherworldly grin at Kincaid’s effort. But he missed the intent of the movement. Sigurd took the shot, and the arrow slammed into the man. Floating on an air pocket, the man took the impact of the projectile against his shield. Even though the missile couldn’t punch through the defense, the impact was enough to send the floating man spinning several yards away. More arrows followed the path. Spinning out of control, the man gave up his cushion of air and collapsed to the ground. Except the field became another hole that buried the man alive. With a crushing push, Kincaid snapped the life out of the man before he could react. Adelaise was in a fight for her life. She was fast, and her blades hunted for a target. But the invisible opponent didn’t give her an opening for an attack. At least any movement was sufficient for Adelaise’s trained reaction to respond to sounds. Even the shuffling of feet was enough to drive the female wizard back. Kincaid launched a small fireball from his hands. The blast rippled against the power around the invisible hecaerae’s shield, revealing the unseen location. Adelaise launched a flurry of attacks against the woman. The family blade was a dark streak in Kincaid’s eyes. The blade tore through the magical shields and brought a stream of blood and a surprised yelp from the attack. The darkness surged in Adelaise’s hands. In a moment, the last student was down. Kincaid turned back to Bartalan to see the man clutching Sholeh’s throat.",

Let her go.” “Everyone saw what you can do. Everyone.” “There are no witnesses left, Bartalan. Just you and me. We can settle this.” “That’s what he wants.” “Who?” “The one who is telling us what to do. You know what it is, don’t you?” Kincaid steps shuffled to a stop in the street. His hands fell by his side as he looked at the desperation on Bartalan’s face. Sholeh hung limply in his arm. Strength surged in Bartalan’s hand to keep her body off the ground, and a thought would snap her neck. “A voice. An image of the future.” “No. It wants one of us to win.” “Then you should give up now.” “I won’t. You have everything that I want.” The voice edged into the hysterical. Magic raged in Bartalan’s soul as his mind fought for control of the magic he wielded. “Then the woman has nothing to do with that.” “If she gives me leverage, then she has everything to do with what I want. What it wants.” Kincaid hunted inside his mind for the voice to talk to him again. That insistent rumble was gone. Watching. Waiting. Calculating. At least Kincaid was alone. Kincaid glanced into the future between them, and the ghostly images stayed linked to their bodies. The standoff would continue. “Your friends can’t harm me.” Kincaid glanced toward Adelaise circling behind Bartalan, and he noted Sigurd coming down from his rooftop perch. His bared steel pointed like a lance toward the hecaerae. Kincaid nodded. “I know that.” “You have so much more to lose than I do. And I stand to gain everything. Listen to your mind. The voice. We can work together and take on the world.” Kincaid noticed the fingers twitch and the wildly gesturing free hand. “Is that what your voice says to you? Cooperate and work together? Join forces?” Doubt flashed across Bartalan’s face, and the hand locked on Sholeh’s throat. With augmented strength, he lifted her body until her boots left the ground. “This offer isn’t going to last, Kincaid.” “Nor is mine, Bartalan. You need to put her down, and we’ll have a talk. Just you and me.” Kincaid started to walk forward. He kept his magic in close check, and the number of souls left as his command was a paltry few. Maybe two more surges of magic or one strong push, and they’d be done. He’d burn through his life in a few moments against the power Bartalan could wield. “Take another step, and I’ll kill her. Then the others.” “Like the number of steps we take matters for men like you and me.” Kincaid shook his head. “You’re losing it, hecaerae. Put her down.” Bartalan lifted her higher, and Kincaid heard Sholeh choking from the pressure. Her breath rattled as her body fought for each ounce of air into her lungs. He was done negotiating with this hecaerae. With a small surge of magic, Kincaid crafted a pocket of time between himself and Bartalan. He closed the distance to minimize the amount of magic he’d need to adjust the time flow. Magic surged and raged in his heart as the next soul died. With a flick of magic, a whip of arcane energy lashed out from Kincaid’s fingertips. Bartalan couldn’t move fast enough to avoid the blow. The whip flashed across Bartalan’s forearm. Pain registered in his eyes in slow motion. He tried to pull his head to look at his arm as blood splashed from severed veins. Sholeh fell to the ground, her body outside of the time pocket. Bartalan’s hand fell away from his body. In the next moment of stolen time, Kincaid lashed air like steel bands around his opponent and closed the last two steps. The time pocket collapsed between them. “How?” Blood pooled at his feet, and Bartalan still wanted to know about magic. “Let me show you.” Kincaid grabbed Bartalan by the head. Both hands clutched the sides of the man’s face, and the roaring magic inside Bartlan’s soul leaped to the touch. Kincaid pulled in a deep breath and grabbed the soul. Recognition flashed in Bartalan’s eyes for a moment. Then the body was a soulless corpse in Kincaid’s hand. The raging magic was gone, and the powerful soul swirled next to Kincaid’s own. The edge of the city was quiet.",

      "title": "Kincaid - Aftermath",
      "content": "Kincaid - Aftermath “What just happened?” Adelaise asked. “Magic.” Kincaid turned away from the approaching mercenary and dropped to his knees next to Sholeh’s body. He clutched her hand and gave it a squeeze as he watched her chest rise and fall with each life-giving breath. She’d suffered so much since he discovered his power with magic. Noble families and now wizards went after her to get to him. With his new group of companions, they’d be next for anyone who wanted to influence him. Worse, they’d torture them to find out his secrets. But he couldn’t go on without them. They were his foundation to maintain control of his soul. The constant battle with his conscience was always in question as he considered what he had to do to keep him safe. The curse of his magic forced him to make terrible choices. Why did Sholeh even stay? Kincaid couldn’t hide from these thoughts as he watched her body fight to stay alive. Her eyes twitched under closed lids, and her body drug itself back to consciousness. Pain flashed across her face as her awareness registered the pain. It broke Kincaid’s heart that he was responsible for her suffering. Again. “I couldn’t see everything you did, Kincaid.” Adelaise’s voice distracted him from Sholeh’s plight. “Probably better that way.” Kincaid looked up from his fallen friend at the wide eyes and surprised face of the mercenary. Sigurd stayed a respectful distance away from the group, unwilling to come closer. “No, I had a clear line of sight to you and the rest of the fight, and I couldn’t see everything you did. You were beyond sight, making things happen. Then you were here.” Awe shaped the tone of her voice. “I did what I had to do. Our plan could have gone bad quickly when Bartalan brought these other students into the fight.” “I’m not so sure they fought as students. Full hecaerae.” “The line is blurred between student and master. The curse of magic is terrible. The young ones want the power the arcane plane can give them. The old ones have the wisdom to never use it.” Sigurd spat to the side and muttered, “Magic.” “Today, I agree with you, Sigurd. My life used to be simple, and then I was imprisoned for power I didn’t know I had and didn’t know how to use.” “Use it, you did.” Adelaise pointed out the bodies of the students in the open area. “And you saved our lives in that fight. More than a student.” Kincaid watched the pools of blood collecting under the corpses. None drew a breath or dreamed of a potential future. Their last decision was to join Bartalan and engage in this fight against Kincaid and his group. “Magi.” “What does that mean?” “Some days, I feel like it’s a title of wisdom and a grand gesture of power. Others, I wonder if it is a curse word to indicate the damned. I’d trade it all to have my old life back.” Adelaise squatted next to Sholeh. Her fingers probed Sholeh’s neck and traced lines across the body. “She’ll be ok. Her heart is beating fine, and I don’t think she has any bad breaks. Sigurd, let’s pick her up and move from here. The lightning and power may have kept the people and guards away, but that’ll change soon. We should get a head start against some of the questions that will come our way.” Sigurd took a circular route to keep a distance away from Kincaid as he approached. His eyes never left the young magi as he crouched next to his friend. Kincaid didn’t blame him for his caution and fear. The northerner scooped her head up under one giant arm, and then he swept the other arm under her legs. He hefted her up like a baby in his arms, and Sholeh let out a groan from the change of position. Kincaid winced with the moan, but Adelaise was right. They needed to move away from here. “Where to?” Adelaise looked around the area. “I’m going to head down the street and scout out a place for us to get a room. Walking in with a body is going to attract more attention than we want. Kincaid, stay with Sigurd.” Sigurd shot Adelaise a look of disgust. The mercenary ignored him as she set off at a quick pace down the Outer City's side street. “Let’s follow, but more slowly.” “They will find us, yes.” “Depends on who you mean by ‘they.’” “More students.” He avoided the word wizard. “I don’t think so. Bartalan led a small group of wizards that hungered for power. I think he brought all that he could to this fight.” “Hope, yes.” “Hope for sure.” He wished he had more confidence in what he was saying for their group. Another attack would be more than they could bear. Kincaid analyzed the powerful soul mixed with his own. He doubted they would attack again, and he knew they couldn’t win against his power. But he’d be back to where he was—a simple man with a soul threatened by every moment of magic. “Where do we go next?” At least the northerner was using the term “we.” “I’m in the anywhere but here camp, Sigurd. Too many enemies and too much unfinished business. In this town, that’s a challenge for every other source of power.” Despite the load, Sigurd’s footsteps were light and quick. He walked as if he wasn’t carrying the most important person in Kincaid’s life. His eyes didn’t stop looking to the rooftops and the shadows of each alley. Kincaid flinched at each sound echoing down the street. Adelaise and her red cloak flickered up ahead. She worked in and out of several buildings but kept moving down the street. Kincaid wasn’t sure they had enough distance away from the fight before the watch showed to investigate the bodies, but he wondered if it mattered. With enough bodies, they’d seal the city and keep up the search. In a few moments, Adelaise was moving toward them. Her blades swung at her hips as she trotted down the street. “There’s a house with a room for rent. It has a back set of stairs. It’ll work for now.” Kincaid nodded his thanks. Adelaise guided them to the structure and led the way up the stairs. She pulled open the door and slipped inside. The room stunk of old sweat and sticky beer. He didn’t want to know what the fluid was in the jug in one corner of the room. A mouse scurried away from the pile of old straw in one corner. “Your taste is in question,” Sigurd said. Even the hardened northerner wasn’t impressed with the choice. “Well, I didn’t think we would make the grand parade up the Emperor’s street to grab a room in a palace.” “I don’t think anyone looking for us would start there.” Kincaid’s humor fell flat. “With as many bodies as we leave behind in this city, I imagine we’d be standing at the foot of the throne explaining why we shot, cut, and killed so many guards.” Kincaid let the discussion go. He picked through the best of the straw on the ground and created a small pile. Sigurd lay Sholeh down and adjusted her body to allow her to relax. “I will go and get some food and drink, yes.” “Smarter than the rest of us.” Sigurd smiled and headed out the door.",

Fetching water was too dangerous now. “How many organizations are we talking about?” “A few extra for Sigurd and me.” “Nice. Place odds on if we’ll make it to tonight?” Kincaid snorted and turned back to Sholeh’s unconscious body. “Even our unconscious friend has her own troubles.” Adelaise padded up and placed a hand on his shoulder. “I made a mistake coming to Pilaetium. I thought people here could help me, but I made everything worse.” “You did find people who can help you. They just weren’t the ones you were planning.” She gave him a smile and a squeeze on the arm. For a moment, that touch shifted the heavy burden on his soul. “You don’t have to stay.” “And miss out on all the fun this group has?” Her smile revealed her white teeth, and laughter danced across her eyes. “A mercenary on probation isn’t a marketable source of income. Might as well hang out with the wizards and see what wealth can come our way. Right?” “It seems like we live on the edge of starvation rather than adventure. Not sure if this is a wealth-building profession. So far, I find myself at the mercy of a few well-meaning people.” “Then we’ll need to change that in our future. Find a place where we can start a new life and use some skills that can make us some money.” Kincaid looked toward his friend. “Money hasn’t been the goal. Just a means. Once, I used to dream of running my own shop in Caesea. I knew how much each square foot of space cost. I built a plan to pay my workers, earn a commission, and create art. All of that is gone. And I wonder if any of that was ever worth it.” “Do not confuse the mess we are in now with the dreams you once had—” “I don’t. But my experience burned through the fog of the man I once was. I see there’s so much more to the world. The darker parts have always been there.” “Which is why you need a talented group of friends to back you up. It’s just one reason why people come to my guild. For the right price, someone is there to back them up.” “I don’t have anything to pay.” “I’m not a mercenary now. Just a friend.” Kincaid blinked back the water flooding his vision. He didn’t look up as Sholeh stirred from her prone position. “What is that smell?” Her voice squeaked with the words, and Kincaid rushed to sit next to her. He held her hand in his lap. “First place that we found to get you off the streets.” “By all that is holy, you should have looked harder to find somewhere else.” She licked her lips, and her eyes slipped open. She reached up to stroke Kincaid’s scruffy face. “Do not worry. I am made of tougher metal than you think.” “Against magic, metal doesn’t seem to work too well.” The door came open as Sigurd came back. “Smells worse than I remember. And metal does work against magic. Ask the students, yes?” Sholeh pulled herself up into a sitting position, bracing her body in the corner of the room. Sigurd handed her a full skin of liquid. She looked questioningly at the bag. “Water. Ale is too much for you right now.” He gave a smile. “The brew is for us.” He handed out two loaves of bread and put a small pot on the floor. When he pulled the top off, the aroma of a thick gravy stew flooded the chamber. “I’m impressed. Where did you get this?” Adelaise asked. “I am Sigurd, thief. Perhaps you have heard of me?” “We weren’t supposed to attract more attention to our group, Sigurd.” Adelaise didn’t move toward the food. “I didn’t bring attention. They will not even know it was gone. Besides, I paid for most of it. Just hungry after a good fight.” Adelaise shook her head. Sholeh tried a small sip of water and winced as her throat contracted from the effort. Sigurd, on the other hand, took a long pull from a jug. “Where do you think we should go from here?” Kincaid asked the question on his heart. As he looked at his three companions, he appreciated their patience with his crazy ideas. But, this wasn’t time for fancy rhetoric. All eyes in the room turned toward him. Their faces were honest and open, and each looked at him with respect. Sholeh’s even held understanding. Kincaid didn’t sense any were keeping a secret agenda. “Time to see more of the world, yes? Spread the legend of Sigurd to new lands, make different merchants fear for their wealth.” Sigurd’s smile was contagious, even as he buried it with another drink. Adelaise shook her head at the large man’s antics. “There’s no option for us to make a living here. Every major power within the city now has a grudge, and more will become interested when those student corpses are discovered. Time to find our way someplace else.” Sholeh took another sip of the water. Her neck was already starting to bruise. “I do not see a reason to stay here. But if there is something else you need to learn, my friend, then we will make it happen.” Kincaid’s heart swelled with the emotion in the room. Each one had come here for their own purposes, and each chose to fight for each other. A fight they could have easily lost. Now they were offering to leave behind the very reason they came to Pilaetium. For him. He wrestled with the thoughts. “I wish I could find words better than thank you. Nobody has to leave here with me.” He held up his hand before any of them could argue their point. They’d already been clear with him. “But there’s nothing left for me to learn here, Sholeh. The hecaerae don’t have secrets they will share, and I understand their flavor of power. Magi Cormac was right at the same time he was wrong. What do we do?” That was the harder question, and the group considered what their future might look like. Kincaid was confident it would be together. “We should start by moving away from the stench of this room,” Adelaise said. “Yes, and we should remember who found this one. Taste is not the captain’s strength.” Adelaise glared at the grinning man. “Besides, we want to keep the investigators off our trail. Move further into the city to plan our next move.” “To the Northern States?” Sholeh’s voice was low but clear. Anywhere but here would be a good start. Kincaid stroked his chin. “Magi Cormac told me he started learning magic in the Northern States. All when he was much younger.” “But this mentor of yours sent you to the Empire to find out more. Seems like a bit of a contradiction,” Adelaise said. “I agree. But magic has been a contradiction from the moment I used it. Imprisonment for using this power was just the first contradiction.” “At least the Northern States will be colder, and the air is pure. A land of good fights, yes?” “I thought you were a thief?” Adelaise joked. “When necessary. But always a northman.” “It’s a start, but it’ll take some work to uncover the centers of magic in the Northern States. But I feel like I just keep missing something. I hope we can find it in the north.” “How do you feel, Sholeh. Do you think you can move? We don’t want Sigurd carrying you again.” Adelaise had genuine concern in her voice. “I think I can walk.” The smith got to her feet and put one hand against the wall behind her for balance. She held her head up and smiled. “Yes, this feels better to stand up.” “Then we should leave in twos with a small gap between our departure. A group like ours will attract attention.” “Where to?” Kincaid asked. “Back to the docks, yes? There’s a bar there that I know. Only a few rooms to let to private customers. The Three Sails Bar, two streets off the water. A quiet place to drink. I will get the room.” Kincaid didn’t have better options at this point, and the docks would be an excellent place to consider their next destination. “We’ll see you there.”",

      "title": "Sholeh - Farewell",
      "content": "Sholeh - Farewell The docks were always an exciting district. When she was a blacksmith in this city, the ship captains and merchants from this area were faithful customers. They needed quality work and paid with solid coin for the effort. Many would tell the tales of adventure on the seas and the exotic lands away from the Empire. Those stories were often too hard to believe because the Empire was a remarkable place of collected wealth and power. Armies sallied forth in the spring and returned with prizes and prisoners in chains from around the world. Now the docks were a refuge—a location to blend in away from the forces looking for them. The concealment wouldn’t last long. The simple bars held simple people. Sholeh didn’t doubt for a second that any of these men or women would sell them out for a few coins. Life was survival out here. Sides didn’t matter. Except for the three people gathered in the room. Each of them picked a side, and none of those choices included organizations from the Inner City. In fact, they created their own center of power by magic, by blade, and by friendship. There was a guiding light for their efforts. Too much had happened for them to consider it was all coincidental. Kincaid worried her the most. His soul carried the world. She remembered the young man with a fire in his heart to take on the world. He was poised to be a young master of his own shop and had the discipline to make those dreams a reality. She’d fallen for that man, and he always made her stronger. That young man wasn’t standing in front of her anymore. His eyes were wrinkled, and his face carried the weight of his responsibility. The old Kincaid was under the façade, but that former self didn’t often emerge in their time in Pilaetium. He looked like a soldier who’d seen too many campaigns. Kincaid caught her lingering gaze and gave her a smile. That simple grin melted her heart. The old Kincaid was there, right how she remembered him. If she could get him help with his magic, they might be able to start again. A rap at the door startled Sholeh from her introspection. “Sigurd, you should come downstairs.” The voice was low but insistent from the other side of the paneling. Sigurd lunged for his blade and gripped the pommel in one hand, and the other grabbed the sheath. Adelaise was in a low crouch, balance forward. Her weapons were always within reach. He looked back toward Adelaise and Sholeh and shrugged his shoulders when no one came through the door. Sholeh tried not to gasp when she glanced at Kincaid. The young man’s eyes glowed with blue shards of ice in front of the usual green irises. She imagined he was humming with the power of magic. His snarl curled the corner of his right lip, and his body was ready for a fight. Sigurd wrapped his weapon belt around his waist and cinched it tight. With his height, drawing a blade over his shoulder inside this inn would be impossible. He’d be left with his dirk. Before the northerner left, he held a finger to his lips for silence. As the door clicked shut, Sholeh went to Kincaid’s side and placed a hand on Kincaid’s forearm. His eyes gazed off into a place beyond the door of the room. Maybe beyond the confines of the city. A bead of sweat formed on his brow from an effort she couldn’t understand. “I’m right here, my friend.” She gave him a squeeze to pull him back from the edge of the abyss. Kincaid blinked a few times and looked her way. His smile was back. Big, genuine, and with teeth. “You can tell now?” “By all that is holy, you do not make it very hard to tell you are pulsing with the power of your magic.” Adelaise shot them a look, and Sholeh lowered her voice. Kincaid caught the glance as well and pulled close to Sholeh. She liked the feel of his warmth, and his breath tickled her neck. “I didn’t know what was on the other side of that door. Not magic, but it could still be dangerous.” “We understand, Kincaid. We are in this together.” He nodded to affirm her assurance and slipped his arm around her shoulders. After a squeeze, he dropped the embrace and focused back on the door. Footsteps climbed the stairs, and the wood creaked in protest from the weight approaching the door. Three quick knocks followed by two long knocks. They held their breath with the pause, and then the door lock clicked. Sigurd ducked to enter the room. “Here for Sholeh.” Sholeh glanced at her friends. None had an accusing glance. “By the good and the holy, who?” “Looks like several people from the church. Big words, wealth, and emblems. And asking specifically for you.” “Why would they want you to come downstairs?” Sigurd chuckled. “Finding the big northerner, the redhead, and the woman in red was easier than the city native. And they know you are with this group.” “It was a matter of time before they found us, Sholeh. It’s ok, we’re with you,” Adelaise said. “Did they want me to come alone?” “They did not say this. I think Adelaise is right. Perhaps they should see the entire group.” “How many did they bring?” “Three. Two men at arms and a priest.” “Not enough to capture me.” Sholeh chewed on the inside of her lip. After the time in the stonecutter’s yard, she expected a swarm of knights and priests to fall on their position. They’d take what they wanted. Like they always did. “We won’t let that happen, Sholeh.” Kincaid’s hand slipped into hers and gave her a squeeze. If they didn’t bring a wizard, they’d never have a chance to take her. The confidence flowing into her veins was enough to decide. “I think I will go downstairs and see what they want. Would any of you like to join me for a walk?” Smiles and nods around the room. Her companions adjusted themselves and let her lead the way. The corridor was simple wood with no decorations. Doors were shut and probably latched. Life on the docks was never easy, and this inn wasn’t known for its prosperity. Sigurd picked this inn because it had numerous exits to different alleys near the docks. The common room greeted them with smells of cooking meat and the crackle of a fire. Smoke traced patterns along the ceiling's timbers as the staff worked to prepare an evening meal over the fire in the room. With most patrons, sailors, and dockworkers already at work, the space was empty except for the staff, a few drinkers, and the church's people. Sholeh recognized the priest but fought down her emotions. Of all the people he could have sent, he sent this one. “Sholeh, it has been quite some time. You look lovely.” “I will not go willingly.” “I did not bring an army.” The priest in his elaborate and expensive robes looked over her friends. “But it seems you did. Perhaps you expected a fight?” “After the stonecutter’s, I expected a fight. But I also expected to win.” “Yes, yes. I can see that with your gathering. But if you were so certain on avoiding the church and all her glory, I can’t imagine why you would want to stay within the confines of Pilaetium. I would imagine you were asking for trouble.” “On some days, we found it. We are not staying, Cyrus.” “I’m glad you remembered, my betrothed. I hoped we didn’t need to go through formal introductions at this juncture.” Heat flushed Sholeh’s face, and she didn’t dare to look at her friends. “But I’m only somewhat familiar with your companions. I gather the northerner is Sigurd. I heard the people at the bar mention that one.” “Yes, thief of Pilaetium. Warrior of the north. Perhaps you have heard of me?” The priest ignored him. Sigurd didn’t seem to mind, and he circled out to the left to keep both guards in sight. “And you. The wealth in your weapons alone is fit for nobility. I would imagine that even the emperor would be jealous of those blades.” “He would be hard-pressed to send enough soldiers after me to take them.” Adelaise shrugged her shoulders and leaned against the wall off to Sholeh’s right. “You don’t need all of this help, Sholeh. I’m not here for a fight. You can see I only brought enough guards to make my way to the Outer City and the filth of the docks.” “I would imagine a priest would find a home here among the unbelievers. Spread the faith for those most in need.” Sholeh couldn’t keep the edge out of her voice. She didn’t like where Cyrus was going with this conversation. Typical of events in the city, though. Always posturing for position and power. Sholeh had been his prize. “Yes, yes, of course. I will certainly stop by the chapel on my way back to the cathedral. But the patriarch won’t be happy unless I bring you with me.” “The patriarch will not see me. Perhaps the bodies were not the right message for him?” “I’m afraid he will insist, Sholeh.” “You did not hear the young lady. It is time for you to leave.” “I’m afraid not, Sigurd.” He turned back to Sholeh and locked his gaze on her eyes. “You should have left if you truly did not want to see him.” Sholeh glanced around the room. The servants were making their way out of the common area, and crackling fire hungrily consumed the fat dripping from the meat on the spit. “You aren’t alone,” Kincaid whispered. She imagined knights and soldiers guarding every door, sealing her friends inside. Torches would hungrily consume the walls, filling the inn with smoke. Crossbows would cut down any that tried to escape. They were trapped. “I was sent in here because you would trust me more than any other.” “I’ve known you for a long time.” Sholeh couldn’t stop glancing toward the main door of the inn. She hoped her friends watched the other exits. The threat of being killed within this inn made her heart race. “Why don’t you come outside and talk with us?” “So you can cut my friends and me down with arrows? I do not think so.” “He thought you would say that.” Cyrus looked down at the ground and then back up to her eyes. “He came from the Inner City to see you.” Sholeh couldn’t keep her mouth from opening as she caught her breath. Her friends clutched their weapons at her reaction and shock. The priest held up both hands with his palms open and facing them. “Then I can bring him in here. He was prepared if you were unwilling to go outside. If you will allow me.” Without waiting for confirmation, Cyrus turned and made for the door. His escort of guards didn’t make a move to follow him. Sholeh spun toward her friends. Her mind raced in the desperation of what was going on. Her eyes found Kincaid first. “By all that is holy, I am sorry.” “Sholeh, it’s ok. Who is waiting for you? Making all of this effort secure us in this building?” Before she could answer the question, a pair of knights in full armor strode into the room. They wore conical helmets with points at the top, mail covered the vulnerable areas of their neck. Gleaming breastplates reflected the low light in the room. They moved forward into the room, stopped two paces away from the group, and waited. A moment later, a small man walked into the bar. He was a balding man with piercing brown eyes. The left side of his mouth was turned upward in a permanent smile that would appear to most as a sneer. Sholeh remembered the fight that left him with the damage all too well. His clothes were rich enough for an emperor, although he didn’t risk the emperor's ire by wearing royal purple. Sholeh was sure he hadn’t figured out how to do that yet. “I have tried every way to get in touch with you, Sholeh. I have gone through so much effort for us to get back together and meet. You just have no idea.” “I do. I remember leaving the bodies behind, avoiding your spies, and fleeing the city. As I returned, you sent more to find me. More bodies.” “I did not want our reunion to be this way.” “By all that is holy, I did not want a reunion. There is nothing left for us.” “Blasphemer.” The word croaked from the deepest part of his chest. “In the presence of the church and her holy servants.” “Come now, father. I have seen you on your less than holy days. I am sure even your bodyguards are convinced that you are not always the anointed one.” “Your father? This priest is your father?” Kincaid’s voice was choked with disbelief. Normally, her father wouldn’t bother to speak to the lowest supplicants. But he graced Kincaid with a look. “Not a priest, foreigner. Patriarch of the church.” Sholeh couldn’t meet Kincaid’s look, and her other companions stayed ready for action. If only she knew how this would develop. “You made quite the journey to come down from the Inner City to see me. I imagine coming to the dock district was enough to make you think twice. No one of power here.” “You mistreat your father, Sholeh,” Cyrus said. Sholeh’s anger exploded in her chest. “You of all people know better than that. You were there when he made his choices. My mother. My brother. Me. Unfair is not a word I would choose.” “Sholeh, there is a time for forgiveness. A time for us to start over. I would like a chance to do that with my daughter. If you will let me.” “No, I did not come back to Pilaetium for this.” “Then, why return?” Her father’s face wrinkled above the eyebrows. The deep lines were signs of his advancing age. “I came back for him.” She pointed back at Kincaid. “My friend needed something here in Pilaetium, and I hoped I would never have to see you again.” “A man. I thought you were better than that.” “He is better than all of us.” Please, no magic now, she thought. Give me one more moment to get rid of him. The risk was too high to display power here. “I wish you felt otherwise. Even after all these years, you still do not have enough love in your heart to start over again. Typical.” “Not typical. What you brought me up to be. You sacrificed everything for your power and your place. You sacrificed our love on your altar of aspiration. You are beyond my forgiveness.” Her father’s lips moved. The corner of his mouth ticked from the old injury. The guards stood motionless and disinterested in the family argument. No words, no commands came forward from his effort. “How long will you stay?” “Why does it matter?” “It seemed to be the polite thing to ask.” “Politeness does not suit you, father. I expected the conniving efforts to bring me back into your camp. Find a way to marry me off to a political opponent. Or worse.” “I would like to be a concerned father for a moment—” “You gave up that right. We will only stay until we can find safe passage away from the city. The Empire will not have to worry about us for very long.” “There are many in the inner circle who are interested in you and your friends, Sholeh. In a short amount of time, you’ve created new enemies. I can help you from within.” “Help? Help? The only one you will ever help is yourself. You would betray your very church if it gave you—” “Sholeh, that’s enough.” Cyrus barked the command between them. He was the only one with the courage and background to interrupt the patriarch. He might even live to see tomorrow’s dawn. “I am sorry that I hurt you in this way.” “It was not just me. I can not even imagine how many others you hurt on your path to power. I do not want to do this, father.” The patriarch hung his head low, the sting of defeat watering his eyes. “You should leave the city very quickly. The emperor is looking for your friend. He is very interested in what he can do, and the others are wanted. Someone has an axe to grind with them. I will not help you. But I will also not resist.” With those few words, he turned and left the room. His personal bodyguard accompanied him. Cyrus stayed for a moment longer. “He was ready to try, Sholeh.” “I was not.”",

      "content": "Sholeh - Farewell The docks were always an exciting district. When she was a blacksmith in this city, the ship captains and merchants from this area were faithful customers. They needed quality work and paid with solid coin for the effort. Many would tell the tales of adventure on the seas and the exotic lands away from the Empire. Those stories were often too hard to believe because the Empire was a remarkable place of collected wealth and power. Armies sallied forth in the spring and returned with prizes and prisoners in chains from around the world. Now the docks were a refuge—a location to blend in away from the forces looking for them. The concealment wouldn’t last long. The simple bars held simple people. Sholeh didn’t doubt for a second that any of these men or women would sell them out for a few coins. Life was survival out here. Sides didn’t matter. Except for the three people gathered in the room. Each of them picked a side, and none of those choices included organizations from the Inner City. In fact, they created their own center of power by magic, by blade, and by friendship. There was a guiding light for their efforts. Too much had happened for them to consider it was all coincidental. Kincaid worried her the most. His soul carried the world. She remembered the young man with a fire in his heart to take on the world. He was poised to be a young master of his own shop and had the discipline to make those dreams a reality. She’d fallen for that man, and he always made her stronger. That young man wasn’t standing in front of her anymore. His eyes were wrinkled, and his face carried the weight of his responsibility. The old Kincaid was under the façade, but that former self didn’t often emerge in their time in Pilaetium. He looked like a soldier who’d seen too many campaigns. Kincaid caught her lingering gaze and gave her a smile. That simple grin melted her heart. The old Kincaid was there, right how she remembered him. If she could get him help with his magic, they might be able to start again. A rap at the door startled Sholeh from her introspection. “Sigurd, you should come downstairs.” The voice was low but insistent from the other side of the paneling. Sigurd lunged for his blade and gripped the pommel in one hand, and the other grabbed the sheath. Adelaise was in a low crouch, balance forward. Her weapons were always within reach. He looked back toward Adelaise and Sholeh and shrugged his shoulders when no one came through the door. Sholeh tried not to gasp when she glanced at Kincaid. The young man’s eyes glowed with blue shards of ice in front of the usual green irises. She imagined he was humming with the power of magic. His snarl curled the corner of his right lip, and his body was ready for a fight. Sigurd wrapped his weapon belt around his waist and cinched it tight. With his height, drawing a blade over his shoulder inside this inn would be impossible. He’d be left with his dirk. Before the northerner left, he held a finger to his lips for silence. As the door clicked shut, Sholeh went to Kincaid’s side and placed a hand on Kincaid’s forearm. His eyes gazed off into a place beyond the door of the room. Maybe beyond the confines of the city. A bead of sweat formed on his brow from an effort she couldn’t understand. “I’m right here, my friend.” She gave him a squeeze to pull him back from the edge of the abyss. Kincaid blinked a few times and looked her way. His smile was back. Big, genuine, and with teeth. “You can tell now?” “By all that is holy, you do not make it very hard to tell you are pulsing with the power of your magic.” Adelaise shot them a look, and Sholeh lowered her voice. Kincaid caught the glance as well and pulled close to Sholeh. She liked the feel of his warmth, and his breath tickled her neck. “I didn’t know what was on the other side of that door. Not magic, but it could still be dangerous.” “We understand, Kincaid. We are in this together.” He nodded to affirm her assurance and slipped his arm around her shoulders. After a squeeze, he dropped the embrace and focused back on the door. Footsteps climbed the stairs, and the wood creaked in protest from the weight approaching the door. Three quick knocks followed by two long knocks. They held their breath with the pause, and then the door lock clicked. Sigurd ducked to enter the room. “Here for Sholeh.” Sholeh glanced at her friends. None had an accusing glance. “By the good and the holy, who?” “Looks like several people from the church. Big words, wealth, and emblems. And asking specifically for you.” “Why would they want you to come downstairs?” Sigurd chuckled. “Finding the big northerner, the redhead, and the woman in red was easier than the city native. And they know you are with this group.” “It was a matter of time before they found us, Sholeh. It’s ok, we’re with you,” Adelaise said. “Did they want me to come alone?” “They did not say this. I think Adelaise is right. Perhaps they should see the entire group.” “How many did they bring?” “Three. Two men at arms and a priest.” “Not enough to capture me.” Sholeh chewed on the inside of her lip. After the time in the stonecutter’s yard, she expected a swarm of knights and priests to fall on their position. They’d take what they wanted. Like they always did. “We won’t let that happen, Sholeh.” Kincaid’s hand slipped into hers and gave her a squeeze. If they didn’t bring a wizard, they’d never have a chance to take her. The confidence flowing into her veins was enough to decide. “I think I will go downstairs and see what they want. Would any of you like to join me for a walk?” Smiles and nods around the room. Her companions adjusted themselves and let her lead the way. The corridor was simple wood with no decorations. Doors were shut and probably latched. Life on the docks was never easy, and this inn wasn’t known for its prosperity. Sigurd picked this inn because it had numerous exits to different alleys near the docks. The common room greeted them with smells of cooking meat and the crackle of a fire. Smoke traced patterns along the ceiling's timbers as the staff worked to prepare an evening meal over the fire in the room. With most patrons, sailors, and dockworkers already at work, the space was empty except for the staff, a few drinkers, and the church's people. Sholeh recognized the priest but fought down her emotions. Of all the people he could have sent, he sent this one. “Sholeh, it has been quite some time. You look lovely.” “I will not go willingly.” “I did not bring an army.” The priest in his elaborate and expensive robes looked over her friends. “But it seems you did. Perhaps you expected a fight?” “After the stonecutter’s, I expected a fight. But I also expected to win.” “Yes, yes. I can see that with your gathering. But if you were so certain on avoiding the church and all her glory, I can’t imagine why you would want to stay within the confines of Pilaetium. I would imagine you were asking for trouble.” “On some days, we found it. We are not staying, Cyrus.” “I’m glad you remembered, my betrothed. I hoped we didn’t need to go through formal introductions at this juncture.” Heat flushed Sholeh’s face, and she didn’t dare to look at her friends. “But I’m only somewhat familiar with your companions. I gather the northerner is Sigurd. I heard the people at the bar mention that one.” “Yes, thief of Pilaetium. Warrior of the north. Perhaps you have heard of me?” The priest ignored him. Sigurd didn’t seem to mind, and he circled out to the left to keep both guards in sight. “And you. The wealth in your weapons alone is fit for nobility. I would imagine that even the emperor would be jealous of those blades.” “He would be hard-pressed to send enough soldiers after me to take them.” Adelaise shrugged her shoulders and leaned against the wall off to Sholeh’s right. “You don’t need all of this help, Sholeh. I’m not here for a fight. You can see I only brought enough guards to make my way to the Outer City and the filth of the docks.” “I would imagine a priest would find a home here among the unbelievers. Spread the faith for those most in need.” Sholeh couldn’t keep the edge out of her voice. She didn’t like where Cyrus was going with this conversation. Typical of events in the city, though. Always posturing for position and power. Sholeh had been his prize. “Yes, yes, of course. I will certainly stop by the chapel on my way back to the cathedral. But the patriarch won’t be happy unless I bring you with me.” “The patriarch will not see me. Perhaps the bodies were not the right message for him?” “I’m afraid he will insist, Sholeh.” “You did not hear the young lady. It is time for you to leave.” “I’m afraid not, Sigurd.” He turned back to Sholeh and locked his gaze on her eyes. “You should have left if you truly did not want to see him.” Sholeh glanced around the room. The servants were making their way out of the common area, and crackling fire hungrily consumed the fat dripping from the meat on the spit. “You aren’t alone,” Kincaid whispered. She imagined knights and soldiers guarding every door, sealing her friends inside. Torches would hungrily consume the walls, filling the inn with smoke. Crossbows would cut down any that tried to escape. They were trapped. “I was sent in here because you would trust me more than any other.” “I’ve known you for a long time.” Sholeh couldn’t stop glancing toward the main door of the inn. She hoped her friends watched the other exits. The threat of being killed within this inn made her heart race. “Why don’t you come outside and talk with us?” “So you can cut my friends and me down with arrows? I do not think so.” “He thought you would say that.” Cyrus looked down at the ground and then back up to her eyes. “He came from the Inner City to see you.” Sholeh couldn’t keep her mouth from opening as she caught her breath. Her friends clutched their weapons at her reaction and shock. The priest held up both hands with his palms open and facing them. “Then I can bring him in here. He was prepared if you were unwilling to go outside. If you will allow me.” Without waiting for confirmation, Cyrus turned and made for the door. His escort of guards didn’t make a move to follow him. Sholeh spun toward her friends. Her mind raced in the desperation of what was going on. Her eyes found Kincaid first. “By all that is holy, I am sorry.” “Sholeh, it’s ok. Who is waiting for you? Making all of this effort secure us in this building?” Before she could answer the question, a pair of knights in full armor strode into the room. They wore conical helmets with points at the top, mail covered the vulnerable areas of their neck. Gleaming breastplates reflected the low light in the room. They moved forward into the room, stopped two paces away from the group, and waited. A moment later, a small man walked into the bar. He was a balding man with piercing brown eyes. The left side of his mouth was turned upward in a permanent smile that would appear to most as a sneer. Sholeh remembered the fight that left him with the damage all too well. His clothes were rich enough for an emperor, although he didn’t risk the emperor's ire by wearing royal purple. Sholeh was sure he hadn’t figured out how to do that yet. “I have tried every way to get in touch with you, Sholeh. I have gone through so much effort for us to get back together and meet. You just have no idea.” “I do. I remember leaving the bodies behind, avoiding your spies, and fleeing the city. As I returned, you sent more to find me. More bodies.” “I did not want our reunion to be this way.” “By all that is holy, I did not want a reunion. There is nothing left for us.” “Blasphemer.” The word croaked from the deepest part of his chest. “In the presence of the church and her holy servants.” “Come now, father. I have seen you on your less than holy days. I am sure even your bodyguards are convinced that you are not always the anointed one.” “Your father? This priest is your father?” Kincaid’s voice was choked with disbelief. Normally, her father wouldn’t bother to speak to the lowest supplicants. But he graced Kincaid with a look. “Not a priest, foreigner. Patriarch of the church.” Sholeh couldn’t meet Kincaid’s look, and her other companions stayed ready for action. If only she knew how this would develop. “You made quite the journey to come down from the Inner City to see me. I imagine coming to the dock district was enough to make you think twice. No one of power here.” “You mistreat your father, Sholeh,” Cyrus said. Sholeh’s anger exploded in her chest. “You of all people know better than that. You were there when he made his choices. My mother. My brother. Me. Unfair is not a word I would choose.” “Sholeh, there is a time for forgiveness. A time for us to start over. I would like a chance to do that with my daughter. If you will let me.” “No, I did not come back to Pilaetium for this.” “Then, why return?” Her father’s face wrinkled above the eyebrows. The deep lines were signs of his advancing age. “I came back for him.” She pointed back at Kincaid. “My friend needed something here in Pilaetium, and I hoped I would never have to see you again.” “A man. I thought you were better than that.” “He is better than all of us.” Please, no magic now, she thought. Give me one more moment to get rid of him. The risk was too high to display power here. “I wish you felt otherwise. Even after all these years, you still do not have enough love in your heart to start over again. Typical.” “Not typical. What you brought me up to be. You sacrificed everything for your power and your place. You sacrificed our love on your altar of aspiration. You are beyond my forgiveness.” Her father’s lips moved. The corner of his mouth ticked from the old injury. The guards stood motionless and disinterested in the family argument. No words, no commands came forward from his effort. “How long will you stay?” “Why does it matter?” “It seemed to be the polite thing to ask.” “Politeness does not suit you, father. I expected the conniving efforts to bring me back into your camp. Find a way to marry me off to a political opponent. Or worse.” “I would like to be a concerned father for a moment—” “You gave up that right. We will only stay until we can find safe passage away from the city. The Empire will not have to worry about us for very long.” “There are many in the inner circle who are interested in you and your friends, Sholeh. In a short amount of time, you’ve created new enemies. I can help you from within.” “Help? Help? The only one you will ever help is yourself. You would betray your very church if it gave you—” “Sholeh, that’s enough.” Cyrus barked the command between them. He was the only one with the courage and background to interrupt the patriarch. He might even live to see tomorrow’s dawn. “I am sorry that I hurt you in this way.” “It was not just me. I can not even imagine how many others you hurt on your path to power. I do not want to do this, father.” The patriarch hung his head low, the sting of defeat watering his eyes. “You should leave the city very quickly. The emperor is looking for your friend. He is very interested in what he can do, and the others are wanted. Someone has an axe to grind with them. I will not help you. But I will also not resist.” With those few words, he turned and left the room. His personal bodyguard accompanied him. Cyrus stayed for a moment longer. “He was ready to try, Sholeh.” “I was not.”",

      "title": "Kincaid - Challenge",
      "content": "Kincaid - Challenge Sholeh disappeared to their room, and Kincaid wanted to support her. His heart broke with her pain, but she placed a hand on his chest as he turned to accompany her upstairs. He didn’t understand how she could face this pain alone. But he cared too much to hurt her again by following. Sigurd headed for the docks to purchase passage. They weren’t picky for destinations, as long as they could leave the capital quickly. All of them understood the highest levels of power would hunt them down. Kincaid wondered how they would pay for ocean passage for the four of them. Better not ask the thief how he would get the job done. Adelaise offered to guard the inn. She’d be ready in case Sigurd got into trouble, or others came looking for the group. Of the four, she was the calmest in the middle of the changes. It was just another day for the mercenary. Kincaid went out toward the docks and looked toward the straights. Sunlight glinted off the water as sea birds paddled their way along the shores. Calls of birds looking for food added to the nearby noise of people grunting under the load of their work by the ships. Wood, metal, and rope worked together in the dock environment. Kincaid sat and crossed his legs. The sunlight warmed his face and drove away his darkest thoughts. The briny smell filled his lungs, and he filtered out the noises. He reached out with his magic to the arcane plane. You’ve figured this out. I knew you were somehow connected to the magic, but I’ve always been on the run without time to think. My experience with magic has been too short, Kincaid thought. Maybe I am more than just connected to the magic. Have you considered this in your thoughts? From the images of the prison, I can only imagine what you might be, Kincaid thought. He wondered how he could converse with something beyond his senses, and he considered how much this other voice could see into his mind. I wondered which one of you would win—fascinating displays of power. Wait, you knew? My two strongest disciples, fighting for ascendancy. Of course, I knew. And you wanted this? Far more than wanted this. I needed to see who would win a contest of magic and a clash of wills. I now know. I don’t understand. I wouldn’t expect you to. But you surprised me. He was so much stronger than you. Strength turns out to not be everything in this world. That’s one thing I learned here in Pilaetium. His drive to claim power was impressive. He was willing to sacrifice everything to be the most fantastic wizard the world has ever seen. He did sacrifice everything. I claimed it. You have a different power and a different strength. You are interesting where the others are amusing. I need to understand more about you. I need to understand who you are. Why do you focus on the who? Maybe you should consider the what. The images you gave me. I’m going to assume you gave them to me. They didn’t come true. Not like Caesea. Time is a fascinating thing. You measure time to count the days to your death. You may learn to understand more and what your visions mean. Kincaid closed off the connection to the arcane plane, and the voice mercifully left his mind. A voice. But connected to what? And how could he be a disciple? Schools at every turn had rejected him. Even Magi Cormac didn’t live long enough to explain more than the fundamentals of magic and his darkest secret. Pilaetium brought him new enemies and challenges with their hecaerae. Learning in this manner was dangerous business. Kincaid opened his eyes and looked out at the peaceful water. A ship made its way from the docks. Men and women scurried across the deck and up the rigging. Sails snapped to life in the breeze even as the ropes and wood groaned. Even from the shoreline, Kincaid heard the wood make its noises. The water parted at the prow and made waves behind the bulk of the ship. Magic must be like the water. Deep and powerful. The ship was the human soul, groaning under the pressure of the unseen elements. Currents and tides, wind and rain. All fought to claim the vessel as it made its way to its destination. The most influential captains caught the attention of merchants and kings. Kincaid wondered if being a magi was the same as being a skilled captain. The metaphor didn’t work. Kincaid could shape the tides and currents with the power of his will. The weather was his to control and shape. And when he did, the ship would be destroyed by the swirling powers around him. The sight was beautiful to his eyes, but his unsettled mind couldn’t make the metaphor work right. If the sea was the arcane plane, then what was the voice? How could he see into the future or get these visions? More questions that he struggled to answer. Someone had to have more knowledge about the powers of magic. The price of magic was terrifying. Even if someone knew more, would they even be alive long enough to pass down their findings? What if the secrets were too dark for anyone to record? He had to push those thoughts aside. Doubts wouldn’t get them out of the city, and languishing in dark thoughts didn’t serve him well. He needed more time and opportunity to work all of this out in his head. “A great deal of water, yes?” the voice was low. Sigurd lowered himself to the ground and offered Kincaid a jug. Without asking what it was, Kincaid took a long pull of the thick brew. It wasn’t even that bad. “Are you sure a ship is the right way to go?” “On land, everyone can find us and get ahead. At sea, we only have the crew.” “Until we get to our destination. Anyone will be able to talk to people on the dock and find out where we are going. They can get ahead of us.” “This is true. But doing things past the Empire is much easier, yes? Not as strong as we head away from this place.” “Did you find our passage?” “A place to walk? Many passages in this big city.” Kincaid didn’t bother to hide his grin. “A ship.” “Yes, many good ships at the dock. We will not take one to Caesea, yes?” Kincaid raised an eyebrow as he looked at the large northerner’s blue eyes. “Then farther north. Perhaps to the Northern States.” “Probably the best choice of any.” Kincaid shared the rest of the ale with Sigurd as they looked out at the straights. The Northern States was as good as any other location. He was from the lands of one of the dukes. And so was Magi Cormac. Kincaid struggled with the memories of the prison. They’d talked about his initial efforts with magic in the Northern States. The time before he traveled to Caesea and trained the sorceratti. There were experiments with magic back then. Before the sorceratti. The same time as the hecaerae? Hope lit Kincaid’s heart as he considered the next events they’d face. But first, he needed to talk to Sholeh. He wouldn’t be able to do anything without her.",

      "content": "Fire Liquid fires of magic burned through Lin’s soul. Pain pumped through her veins, but her senses never felt so alive. Every hair on her skin ignited with the touch of air on her bare arms. The drone of the ever-present flies in the tannery deafened her hearing. Lin was alive in a way that only those who could touch the power of magic could understand. Magic burned from the inside out. Channeling a stream of this power, Lin crafted a flame in the palm of her hand by imagining a candle. Magic responded to her desire. The fire flickered into being and lit the room with a blue glow. The flame had no heat, and it did not need fuel. Her arcane experiment moved up and down her fingers, and Lin commanded the fire to dance across her palm. Lin tried to hold back her laughter and held on to the flow of magic. She was alive. She was more alive than ever with each use of her gift. “Lin! What are you doing?” Uh oh. She winced and closed off the flow of magic. The flame snuffed out without the telltale sign of smoke, and the darkness of the room overwhelmed her. The collapse of power left her senses in the dark, and a part of her soul was gone, empty. She was in the same place she had been for fourteen years. “Ummmm… hold on.” “Lin.” Lin knew what she was supposed to be doing. But she panicked with the insistent tone in her adoptive father’s voice. She took too long to fetch the water buckets. Her hands grasped for the iron handles and missed. Her knuckles throbbed with the impact. The wooden bucket crashed to the floor and rolled around. Caught. “What are you doing? Get those buckets and get out here.” Stars flooded her vision as Lin bent down to pick up the bucket and slammed her forehead into the wall. The blow knocked her back on her heels, and curse words jumped to her mind. Tired of hiding this. Should just light this place with magic. Better to turn the tannery to ashes and get out of here. The panic and the injury clouded her mind, and the arcane force felt out of reach. She couldn’t touch the power; she couldn’t sense it. Lin found the buckets in the dark. The door latch resisted her fumbling thumb’s pressure. The polished wood finally gave way with a thump. She shoved the door open, and the oak door banged against the wall. Lin grabbed the buckets and strode into the room. “Here’s the buckets, Johannes.” Her voice sounded guilty to her own ears. Not the defiant tone she wanted. Johannes didn’t look up as he hunched over a massive vat of bubbling and hissing fluids. He perched a wooden platform and clenched a board crafted like a thick oar in his curled hands. Arms stirred without pause in a practiced motion she’d seen him perform for hundreds of hours. Churning chemicals to tan leather was a menial task. Without looking up from his labor, he said, “What’re you doing, Lin?” She hated that accusing voice. She was wrong for hiding in the storage area and felt guilty. But now he gave her that fatherly disappointment. Lin couldn’t think fast enough when he used that voice, so she had to go with the half-truth. “Fumbling in the dark for the bucket. Banged my head as I was picking them up.” “Didn’t know the storage closet would be dark?” Didn’t work. Lin crossed her arms across her chest, shifted her weight to her back foot, and looked him square in the eyes. She dared him to question her. Johannes took in a deep breath and sighed. “Lin, when you’d come to my shop four years ago, didn’t want you. No place for a girl with no family, no money, and no desire. Let you stay—” “Johannes, I’m—” “No.” The emotion tore through Lin’s heart and melted her stance. He was right, and he did take her in when there was nowhere to turn. “Kept you around because you worked hard and could be good at this. No wife, no sons, and being alone was work. You’ve been faithful—” “I’m sorry.” Johannes looked her in the eyes as he stopped his churning motion. “Know you are, but we got to finish this leather. Can’t do this alone.” He can’t, and Lin knew it. She grabbed the two heavy buckets and walked toward the door. As she passed, Johannes let go of his long board and wrapped an arm around her. Not a full hug, Johannes wasn’t like that. Lin knew she wouldn’t get the lecture on loafing. She smelled sweat, and the tonics of tanning permeating his apron. But it was his scent and the first in her young life she could remember. Lin couldn’t stand the smells of the tannery, but she couldn’t live without them. * * * Lin’s arms were exhausted. Her back burned as she tried to straighten with the load filling her arms. The stack of leather armor pieces weighed more after Johannes’ process. She wished Johannes would hire help or take on another apprentice. At least someone else could help move the finished products into storage. That wasn’t going to happen. The last breastplate would fit on top of the pile of finished armor. Lin didn’t have time to rebuild another stack, and Johannes hated uneven piles. Heaps of different heights proved she didn’t plan ahead, and he didn’t want to give customers the idea he didn’t do good work. She gave one last lift and reached to the top of her toes. Done for the day. Please don’t fall over. Her hands scrambled to hold the stack of armor up, but the weight was too much. She scurried out from under the collapsing pile. “Lin, armor better not be scratched. You’ll be polishing it ‘til sunrise if it is.” “Let me clean it up.” What a mess. Each piece of armor must weigh twenty pounds, and the entire stack was on the ground. Lin’s body registered the bruises from the crash, and her exhausted mind wanted to let go and cry. Her stomach growled. Why didn’t I grab the ladder? Now she’d sit and stack the lowest level again. She steeled herself for the task and began to rebuild each pile. Lost in her thoughts, the banging on the door to the tannery startled Lin. She panicked as she looked at the work she still had to clean up. They had two days to finish the current contract with the Duke. Johannes wouldn’t take on more jobs until he was done with this one, his biggest deal yet. Tears welled in her eyes. She couldn’t work more hours than she was putting in. The voices coming from the work area were loud. Lin wondered why they were shouting, so she slipped closer to the door and tried to make out the words. She peeked through the cracked door and saw the fires under the massive iron vats glowed a deep red. But it was enough light to make out the visitors. A pair of men faced off against Johannes in the deepening gloom of the tannery. They didn’t have the fancy clothes of the Duke’s men, and they didn’t carry themselves like merchants. Lin watched as Johannes crossed his arms over his chest and shook his head. The men turned and left. She wished she heard the conversation.",

      "content": "Fire Liquid fires of magic burned through Lin’s soul. Pain pumped through her veins, but her senses never felt so alive. Every hair on her skin ignited with the touch of air on her bare arms. The drone of the ever-present flies in the tannery deafened her hearing. Lin was alive in a way that only those who could touch the power of magic could understand. Magic burned from the inside out. Channeling a stream of this power, Lin crafted a flame in the palm of her hand by imagining a candle. Magic responded to her desire. The fire flickered into being and lit the room with a blue glow. The flame had no heat, and it did not need fuel. Her arcane experiment moved up and down her fingers, and Lin commanded the fire to dance across her palm. Lin tried to hold back her laughter and held on to the flow of magic. She was alive. She was more alive than ever with each use of her gift. “Lin! What are you doing?” Uh oh.
