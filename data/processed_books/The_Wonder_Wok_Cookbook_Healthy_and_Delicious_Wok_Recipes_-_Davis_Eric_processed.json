      "content": "Introduction If you love Asian cuisine, you certainly love wok meals, as cooking in wok is an essential part of Asian culinary traditions. From China to Indonesia, wok has been one of the main cooking utensils for centuries, offering comfort foods and exquisite meals that fondle our taste buds and mesmerize us with their intense flavor combinations. The major peculiarity and benefit of using wok in your everyday meal preparation is that it takes around 10 minutes to prepare a complete meal, as due to its spherical shape, products are cooked in wok in a matter of minutes, be it meat, seafood or vegetables. And no matter if you opt for a traditional cast iron wok or modern carbon steel model, both would offer the same benefits of fast and eventually healthy cooking, as wok needs just a drop of oil in contrast to traditional frying. Taking care of your wok is not so difficult as well. If you are using a cast iron wok, you should simply brush it with some oil before heating. And after you are done with cooking, it is recommended to let it cool down, then clean it under flowing water with a damp cloth to discard the remaining bits of foods and then just temper it over high flame to dry all the water to avoid corrosion. And in case you are using a carbon steel wok, simply wash it like a usual pan after cooking and cooling down and pat dry it using a kitchen towel. In case your wok is a non-stick one, avoid using aluminum spatulas, opting for wooden ones. If you are willing to spend minimum time in the kitchen to prepare your meals, then wok is a winner here as wok recipes are simple to prepare in almost no time and suit perfectly for your busy schedule. Wok cooking is also a healthy way of enjoying restaurant-like meals at home. Unlike restaurant meals, homemade wok meals are less salty and fatty and include healthier oils, like canola, peanut and olive oil. This cookbook unveils the finest collection of 25 wok recipes to be prepared from your favorite meats (chicken, pork, beef, lamb, duck, etc.), fish & seafood, vegetables and spices. With wok, you don’t need to order your favorite meals from local restaurants as you can simply prepare them at home with our easy-to-follow instructions. The recipes covered in the book offer simple steps to prepare them and are suitable for both beginners as well as kitchen experts; you can effortlessly prepare your favorite meat-based as well as vegetarian meals for your family. Start making healthy wok recipes and enjoy aromatic wok meals prepared from the freshest ingredients in the comfort of your kitchen.",

      "content": "Introduction If you love Asian cuisine, you certainly love wok meals, as cooking in wok is an essential part of Asian culinary traditions. From China to Indonesia, wok has been one of the main cooking utensils for centuries, offering comfort foods and exquisite meals that fondle our taste buds and mesmerize us with their intense flavor combinations. The major peculiarity and benefit of using wok in your everyday meal preparation is that it takes around 10 minutes to prepare a complete meal, as due to its spherical shape, products are cooked in wok in a matter of minutes, be it meat, seafood or vegetables. And no matter if you opt for a traditional cast iron wok or modern carbon steel model, both would offer the same benefits of fast and eventually healthy cooking, as wok needs just a drop of oil in contrast to traditional frying. Taking care of your wok is not so difficult as well. If you are using a cast iron wok, you should simply brush it with some oil before heating. And after you are done with cooking, it is recommended to let it cool down, then clean it under flowing water with a damp cloth to discard the remaining bits of foods and then just temper it over high flame to dry all the water to avoid corrosion. And in case you are using a carbon steel wok, simply wash it like a usual pan after cooking and cooling down and pat dry it using a kitchen towel. In case your wok is a non-stick one, avoid using aluminum spatulas, opting for wooden ones. If you are willing to spend minimum time in the kitchen to prepare your meals, then wok is a winner here as wok recipes are simple to prepare in almost no time and suit perfectly for your busy schedule. Wok cooking is also a healthy way of enjoying restaurant-like meals at home. Unlike restaurant meals, homemade wok meals are less salty and fatty and include healthier oils, like canola, peanut and olive oil. This cookbook unveils the finest collection of 25 wok recipes to be prepared from your favorite meats (chicken, pork, beef, lamb, duck, etc.), fish & seafood, vegetables and spices. With wok, you don’t need to order your favorite meals from local restaurants as you can simply prepare them at home with our easy-to-follow instructions. The recipes covered in the book offer simple steps to prepare them and are suitable for both beginners as well as kitchen experts; you can effortlessly prepare your favorite meat-based as well as vegetarian meals for your family. Start making healthy wok recipes and enjoy aromatic wok meals prepared from the freshest ingredients in the comfort of your kitchen.",
