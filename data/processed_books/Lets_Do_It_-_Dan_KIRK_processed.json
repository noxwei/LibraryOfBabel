      "content": "Dan KIRK – Do Over 4 – Let’s Do It MM How did the world get so off course! We promised never again – but what real choice do we have left? What do you say when the world is ending and your only option is what you promised to never do again? Chapter 1 “I’m way too old for this.” Sean muttered as they stood over the control console and the machine sputtered to life. He’d always been on the short side, and now in his eighties he begrudged every millimeter of height he lost with advancing age. My own hands were as wrinkled as his while I pushed the appropriate buttons on the computer console. The familiar sound of a magnetic resonance imager spinning to life filled the small room. “I can’t believe this specific machine has been used as a regular MRI for twenty years without anyone knowing it was really a time machine.” I muttered and Sean chortled softly before pushing another button and inserting the small flash drive into the correct slot. Five seconds later, the program was being loaded. “It’s always best to hide things in plain sight.” Sean muttered a very familiar mantra and I nodded my agreement. “The time bubble is now active. We’re safe as long as we remain in here.” “No one can come in?” I asked, although I already knew the answer. It was a sign of how nervous I really was. “You know that.” Sean smiled. “We’ve got plenty of power for what we need to do, but not much more than that. The bubble will keep people out, and it’ll keep the radiation out as well.” “That’s good or we might not live long enough to do this.” I said unnecessarily. We both knew the dirty bomb that had gone off thirty minutes ago was killing millions outside the bubble. That was why we’d been sent down here, on direct orders of the President. President David Jones Sr. had passed away many years ago, and while the man who currently held that office was of a different political party, the legacy of knowledge about time travel had been passed to the current President. Every President since Jones had known about the ability to go back in time, but none had given in to the temptation until now. “The program is uploaded.” Sean said with a hint of excitement. Both of our hands were shaking as our eyes met and I nodded. He typed in the execute command, and the machine on the other side of the room began to whir faster. There was no one inside it, but the components that sent a person’s memories back in time were active, sending out the program that Sean and Brandon had developed a decade ago. “It’s working.” Sean said as he nodded with his head towards the television in the corner. It had been showing static, but now it showed a newscaster talking about some report regarding the War on Terror. “That’s still going on?” “It should be over by now.” I muttered, shaking my head as Sean turned up the volume and we listened to the report about the forty-year old war. “The fucker died in bed?” Sean growled angrily. “How much time do we have before the bubble runs out of power?” I asked. “If we don’t use the machine to go back, we could survive in here longer than we have food or water.” Sean answered. “If we use the machine, it depends on how far back we go. The program worked, by the way.” “I figured that.” I answered with a gruff voice and a shake of my head. They were gone, my husband and partner, our sons, our grandkids were all erased along with every instance of time travel in the history of humanity. Our orders were not to go back, but to run the program, erase time travel and all the possible timelines it had created, and then shut down the machine so that we were erased as well. We would pass out of existence, and with us the knowledge of time travel would be gone forever, or at least until someone else invented it in the far future. “Any luck connecting to the Internet?” I asked and Sean started cussing. “All the wireless signals are encrypted and I can’t get around them.” He muttered. “They must use some type of system our timeline never invented.” “That’s a pain in the ass.” I agreed with his sentiments. We’d hoped to use the Internet to make sure this timeline was free from nuclear bombs, gas attacks, and all that crap. “I take it we’ve just got broadcast television, not cable or satellite?” “Just broadcast.” Sean muttered. “Let’s see what we can find.” I said, moving to change the channel. Eight hours later we were both thirsty and had to relieve ourselves in a corner of the room. It now smelled like urine, but we barely noticed based on the things we’d learned. “Amazing how much you can learn just from watching television.” Sean groused as he switched off the offending machine. “Israel nuked six years ago, and the United States held hostage by six ships in harbors of American cities, threatening to detonate nuclear bombs if we interfere.” “They were all wrong.” I muttered with a shake of my head. “The world wasn’t necessarily a better place without the interference of time travel.” “Plan B, then?” Sean asked and I nodded. “Do we have a choice?” I asked. “How much power do we have left?” “Enough to send one person to 1986 and that’s it.” Sean said after he looked at the display panel. “You know it’s not going to be easy. There won’t be any other time travelers now, just whichever of us goes back this time. Plus, we don’t know every little detail of this future or how to fix it.” “We know how to be in place when the time comes.” I answered with a heavy sigh. To be honest, I was looking forward to dying in my old age. My life had been a good one, and if not for this one last incident, I could have died a happy man without time travel messing up my life again. “You want to go, Sean?” “Don’t be an idiot.” Sean growled with a grimace. “I am plenty happy to die when the bubble collapses and leave you to carry the responsibility alone.” “Fine, let’s do it.” I muttered and Sean nodded once with a hint of understanding in his eyes. It took another hour for the preparation to be made and I was laying on the table waiting to be inserted into the machine. Sean was sticking a needle in my arm, injecting the drugs that would slow my brain function and highlight the necessary memories stored in my brain. Then the machine would scan them, record them, and send them back in time to my younger body. This would be different, because the program we’d run hours earlier had ‘jammed’ the signals of other time machines, effectively stopping the transmissions of earlier time travelers. The 1986 I was about to enter was pristine, unchanged by the meddling of other time travelers. Ronald Reagan was President, I lived in Modesto California and David Jones Sr. wasn’t a member of the President’s cabinet. He’d never be President either. So much would be gone, so much of the world I had loved for the past sixty years would be gone forever, and I’d have to build a new life with my love, who wouldn’t even be a friend in this original timeline. Would he remember me at all? Could I convince him he was better off with me than with where his life would lead otherwise? We’d have decades, well years, to try and make it work before anything would need to be done. The history of previous time travel taught that making big changes would only backfire, that small changes yielded the best results. Even with the dirty bomb that had gone off in Washington D.C., this last timeline had been the best of them all. For thirty years there had been a peace relatively unknown in the history of the world, and the history books of that timeline had credited President David Jones Sr. with forging that peace. It had only been bungling by several of the Presidents who took office after him that had created a situation where so many people had died in needless conflict. The old saying was that Pride Goeth Before the Fall, and the pride of the men and women in that office had been high, too high. As always, it had been the common people who had paid the price for the pride of their leaders, and at the last, even the leaders had seen their errors. “You ready?” Sean asked as the drug began to take effect. Really, kind of late for that question wasn’t it, but he knew what Sean was doing. He could die now, never having to go back in time, and Sean would remove his body from the table and go back himself. The burden could be placed squarely on Sean’s shoulders this time, instead of his, but he remembered how painful Sean’s teenage years had been in the original timeline, the timeline he was preparing to go back to, and he shook his head. Sean smiled with tears in his eyes as things began to go grey for me. “Thank you.” Those were the last words I heard as everything went black. How long things were black, I couldn’t tell, but eventually I was able to open my eyes. It was still dark, and I was on my back, in bed. It took a few minutes for me to stumble out of bed. My entire body felt different, moved different, and as I reached the light switch and my eyes squinted in the sudden brightness, I let out a sigh of relief. My vision was clear, no need for those damn glasses. The back of my hands were smooth, with no age spots or wrinkles, and when I ran them over my body, I could feel how tight and smooth it was as compared to my sixty-odd year old body I had just left. My room wasn’t that different than what I had expected and I let out a sigh of relief. Sure, there were difference, like the picture on my desk, but they weren’t shockingly strange. A glance at the clock showed that it was nearly time for me to be up anyway, so I opened my door and proceeded to the shower. It was good, being in my young body again, I decided as I finished the shower and let out a sigh of relief at the dirty deed I’d just finished along with my cleaning. The images of my husband in his youth had been fresh and clear in my mind as were the images and memories of our lives together. Fifty plus years had passed by in the last timeline, and we’d spent them with each other and our children and their children. That should be more than enough for most couples, and it had been, but now I was wondering what another fifty years would be like, and I had a wistful smile on my face as I wrapped the wet towel around my waist and exited the bathroom, only to run into my father. “Brian, what are you doing up?” He asked with surprise and I had to resist the urge to hug him right away. I was fairly sure that, even as good of a son as I was, my father wasn’t use to hugs from his sixteen-year-old son. He’d died ten years ago in the last timeline and I had missed him almost as much as I’d missed mom, who died five years later. “I thought I’d go for a run.” I answered and he gave me a look like I was half-crazy. “You’re still grounded, remember?” He had a warning tone in his voice and I winced. Grounded? What had I done to be grounded? “I don’t care if it was New Year’s Eve, coming home at six in the morning with alcohol on your breath and your girlfriend in the car with you is not behavior I expect from you.” “I… I’m sorry.” I said with shock. “You’re damn right you’re sorry, Brian.” My dad fumed as his anger started rising. Oh fuck, he was really mad. Then again, he had a right to be. I had been a father, and remembered Richie doing something like that when he’d been seventeen. We’d grounded the boy for two months. The thought of my son, who was dead and gone now, brought tears to my eyes. Dad looked at me with some surprise. “Are you progressing to fake tears now?” “No.” I said hoarsely. “No, I’m just… you’re right. I could have killed both of us driving after drinking, and you’re right, it wasn’t right to bring her here. I should have taken her home.” “Well, finally you’re showing some sense instead of talking back or giving me the cold shoulder.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Don’t think you’re un-grounded though. That stays; you’re grounded until your birthday. No car, no friends over, no girlfriends over, and no parties. When school starts, we’ll let you drive your car to school, but you have to come straight home.” “Can I at least go running in the mornings?” I asked. “I promise, I won’t use it to meet up with friends or anything, just go running, by myself.” “What if you just happen to run into a friend along the way?” Dad asked with a frown. “I’ll tell them hello and that my evil father grounded me and I can’t talk to them until school starts.” I said with a half-grin that I knew always softened him up. He actually laughed before giving me a strange look. “Son, I don’t know what happened overnight, but it’s like you finally grew the fuck up.” My dad said with a shake of his head. “I like this Brian a hell of a lot better than the one that told me I was an idiot before he went to bed.” “I’m sorry about that too.” I said, horrified that I would have ever said something like that to my father. He’d always been a good father, one I could tell anything to, or at least he had been in the last timeline. This man didn’t seem all that different than the one I’d known, so I had to wonder if it had been me that had been so different? “You can go for your run.” He said after looking into my eyes. “I don’t know what changed overnight, but I’m willing to trust you this much. Don’t screw it up.” “I won’t, dad.” I said, giving in to the urge to hug him. He looked surprised, but returned the hug after a moment. Then it was time to go back to my room, find a pair of sweats to put on, and to stretch. Old age had put an end to my daily runs with Davey, but we’d still gone for walks each and every day we were both home. Once he’d had his stroke and couldn’t walk anymore, I’d pushed him in his wheelchair around the park across the street from our home. In the last few months, he’d been able to speak a little bit and his constant announcements of how much he loved me had assured me that the stroke may have taken away a lot of things, but it hadn’t taken my Davey away from me. It was refreshingly cold outside as I began my run, and I almost considered going back for another sweatshirt. There was no need though as I began to sweat with the pace I started, trying to see just how my younger body reacted. Running was good not only for my body, but because it allowed me time to think about the situation I was now experiencing. I personally had no memories of this timeline. Everything I knew about it was from what I’d been told by Davey and by Sean. Fortunately, thanks to how time travel worked, I had perfect memories of those conversations. Rather unfortunately, neither of them had been entirely forthcoming about this timeline. Both of them viewed it as a ‘dark’ timeline for them personally and had been reluctant to share details. Still, there were some details that I did know and as I ran, I went over them carefully. All my life, I had known that I wasn’t nearly as smart as either Davey or Sean. They could take in any situation and find solutions to problems like it was no more difficult than breathing. In law school, I’d learned that I could also solve problems, but it took me longer. I had to do a lot of research, and have time to properly prepare what I learned. Then I had to take more time preparing my arguments, figuring out the counter-arguments, and then the counters to those counter-arguments. Davey could do it in the flash of an eye whereas I took hours and hours, but eventually I’d come up with the solution. Sometimes, when the solution required a lot of research and preparation, Davey would flounder while I eventually solved the riddle of the problem. That would be my greatest asset in this situation. I only had pieces of the puzzles that led to the problems off in the far-future in this timeline. For the closer future problems, such as how to win Davey over, I had less time and just as few pieces of the puzzle, but I did have time to think things through and find some solutions. Time was both my enemy and my ally now. President Jones was a key figure in figuring out how to win Davey in this timeline. Not in the sense he might have been if this was 1981, but in the sense of what was going on now. It was our junior year of high school, and Davey had given me several clues as to what was going on with him now. Just thinking about what he was going through made me stumble and lose my pace. Here, in this timeline, Davey and I had never really been friends. We were more like ‘friendly acquaintances’, to use his term, when we were in our freshman year of high school. He’d moved away that year, to a place called Eureka, Nevada. His sophomore year, he’d returned after his mother learned that his father in that timeline had sexually molested Jenny. The thought of President Jones being capable of doing such an evil thing caused me to shudder, and I resumed my earlier pace, enjoying the brisk winter chill, my foggy breath steaming out of me, and the heat being generated by my body as I continued to run. I knew that when they moved back to California, they’d lived with his Nanny, his maternal grandmother and he’d gone to Ceres High for the rest of his sophomore year. Then he’d gotten his mother to get him transferred to Downey for his junior year, the school I attended with our friends Trevor and Brandon. Sean, in this timeline, no longer attended the school because of his ultra-religious parents. Or did he? I could never quite remember that because Sean had never really been specific, nor had Davey. When Davey had gone back to Downey, he’d found we’d all moved on with our lives and didn’t really remember him. As a result, he’d pulled in on himself and sometime during the last half of his junior year, he’d quit going to school, gotten his GED and ended up graduating from Navy boot camp three months before the rest of us graduated from High School. There was much more I didn’t know. Where did he live? Would he still find me interesting? I knew he was already having sex, but then apparently so was I with my ‘girlfriend’, whoever that was in this timeline. Did the fact that we were both already sexually active make it impossible for him to love me the way he did before? No, those were personal insecurities that I’d always felt, and I refused to let them stop me from gaining the love of Davey Jones. Another question I’d have to deal with eventually is what do I tell Davey, and my other friends, about time travel? The secrets of how to build a time machine were dead and gone, and I didn’t know nearly enough to help build another one. Nor did I think we should. That thought made me stop for a bit, breathing heavily into the cold air as I pondered if I was being a hypocrite. I was thinking time travel should die forever, but I’d used it to correct a situation. No, I couldn’t lie to myself. I was far to old to shy away from the truth. Some part of me had known in that last world that Davey and I had never been a couple and I’d come back to change that. Back in the time bubble, I hadn’t even thought about it directly, but down deep I knew the great love of my life had never happened and I couldn’t stand to let things stay that way. The excuse about ‘fixing’ the events of this timeline forty-odd years from now was just that, an excuse, to do what I really wanted. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor’s voice surprised me and I turned to see my old friend jogging up the sidewalk towards me. He had a broad smile on his face and stopped when he reached me. “So, you tricked your old man into letting you out after all?” “No.” I answered a little more harshly than I intended. Some part of me had forgotten how handsome Trevor was at this age. His brown curly hair practically gleamed and while he was a good four inches shorter than me, his body was perfectly trim and in shape. “Sorry, but I promised him I wouldn’t use running as an excuse to get out of being grounded.” “Dude, what’s wrong with you?” Trevor snorted and gave me a look like I was crazy. “Nothing.” I said as I turned and started to head back to the house. “I’ll talk to you in school, Trevor.” “You’re insane!” Trevor shouted. “Did you forget I was supposed to take you to Missy’s?” “Tell her I’ll talk to her in school!” I shouted back. “She’s going to go apeshit!” Trevor shouted but I was far enough away that he didn’t bother trying to catch up. That had been another shock; that the me of this timeline had planned to sneak out just like this, but unlike me hadn’t intended on keeping his word to dad. What the fuck was wrong with this timeline? “You’re back.” Dad said as I walked through the front door. He was wearing an old pair of jeans and a t-shirt as if he was preparing to do some work around the house. I could hear Mom in the kitchen, probably fixing breakfast from the smells that were wafting around the house. “Yes.” I answered him and he nodded. “Your mother will have breakfast ready soon.” He said. “I’ll need your help in the garage after breakfast. The dryer’s squealing.” “It’s probably the motor belt.” I said and he just looked at me. “I’m going to take another shower, okay?” “That’s fine.” He said and I headed into my room. I noticed the pile of school books on the desk and wondered if I had homework left to do. In my own timeline I’d have been confident that I’d already done them, but there was a nagging bit of doubt in me that the “me” of this timeline would probably have just ignored them during the holiday break from school. As I showered for the second time this morning, I wondered what I would find when I went back to school. This should be the Saturday morning before school started, if the machine had worked the way it was supposed to in sending me back here. I could feel my heart racing as I thought about what I would find when I went to school. Would he be there? Would he be in any of my classes? For that matter, what classes would I have and in what time periods? “Good morning, honey.” My mom said as I entered the dining room where she’d already set three places for breakfast. It was nice seeing her so young again, and she smiled when I gave her a hug before sitting down. Dad just watched me in silence while we started eating. Part of me wanted some of the coffee they were both drinking, but I settled for the glass of orange juice to go with the waffles, sausage and eggs. I’d dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, similar to dad’s, so that I’d be ready to work with him as soon as breakfast was done. “Did you see anyone on your run?” Dad asked me after a few minutes of silence. “Yes, Trevor was running too.” I said calmly, watching him as he raised an eyebrow. “Is that why you came back so early?” He asked and I nodded. “I told him I was still grounded.” I informed him. “Good, because you are.” He said sternly and that killed all the remaining conversation until we’d finished eating. As I worked with him on the dryer, I knew things were not okay between him and I in this time, and I debated with myself on how to change that. In the end, I decided it would just take time. “Thanks for your help.” He said as we listened to the dryer run smoothly about an hour later. “No problem.” I replied. “Your homework done yet?” He asked me and I shook my head. “Well you have plenty of time today and tomorrow to work on it.” “Thanks.” I said, taking that as a dismissal and heading inside. After washing my hands, I went into my room and began to look through the books and notebooks scattered on my desk. Twenty-three minutes later I wasn’t a happy camper. The classes I was in at school weren’t what I expected. They weren’t exactly idiot-level courses, but they weren’t the advanced placement courses I’d taken in my own timeline. To make matters worse, the notebooks seemed to be filled with stupid notes between Trevor and I about the physical and mental attributes of girls in our classes. There weren’t even notes about our assignments. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. Giving up in disgust with myself, I got up and went to find one of my parents. “Hi mom.” I said as I found her in her sewing room. She at least smiled at me. “Hello Bri.” She said as she stopped the machine she was using to sew together a dress. “What is it?” “Is Dad here?” I asked. “No, he’s gone over the Marshall’s house for a bit.” She replied. “Oh, I was going to ask him if I could call Brandon.” I said with a sigh. “My notes aren’t clear about one of my assignments and I was going to see if he could help me out.” “Brandon’s not in any of your classes except P.E.” Mom said with a frown and a sharp look at me. “What are you trying to pull?” “I think he has one of my notebooks in his backpack.” I said while trying not to wince at that. “Your dad has your assignments listed from your teachers.” She informed me and this time I wanted to groan. “After your awful grades he got them from your instructors.” “Oh, then I don’t need to call someone.” I said softly. “Do you know where it is?” “Yes.” She said, giving me a sharp look. “You sure you still don’t need to make a call?” “Yeah, I just need the assignments.” I told her and she shook her head. “I almost believe you.” She said as she stood up and went into their bedroom. When she came out, she handed me two sheets of paper with all the assignments written on them. The bad news was that there was a lot listed there, but the good news was that the classes were so easy I’d be able to breeze right through them. “Thanks mom.” I said with a smile. “Don’t forget your father will want to look over them tomorrow.” She warned me and I just nodded. Several times during the youth of our last timeline, Davey had commented on how doing high school work again was both easy and difficult at the same time. For the first time I really understood what he’d meant when he said that. Math was easy, especially this basic algebra crap I was taking now. The English essay I had on a reading assignment was just as easy. The book was even an old favorite of mine in the last timeline, so I just had to skim through certain parts of it to make sure my recollections were correct. History was difficult. It wasn’t difficult because I didn’t remember what the importance of the Magna Carta was, but because most of the assignment was about the memorization of dates. Instead of asking why the provisions of habeus corpus were so groundbreaking, it asked how many of the King’s nobles participated in forcing him to sign the document and what year it was done. Bah! “You want some lunch, honey?” Mom asked several hours later as she poked her head in my door. Apparently I was not just doing assignments over the break, but make-up work to get my grades up a bit. They were barely enough to keep me eligible for sports, and if I was right in my guesses, that was all my younger self was caring about right now. Maybe there was some truth to what Davey and Sean had always said about this timeline. “That’d be nice, Mom.” I said with a smile. She came back a few minutes later with a ham sandwich that I ate while I continued doing math problems with one hand. For a while she just stood there watching me with a little smile on her face. Part of me wondered just how mean this timeline’s Brian had been to her. “How is the homework coming?” My dad asked from the doorway three hours later. “I’m halfway to being caught up.” I told him honestly. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to work out a bit, take a break, and then maybe work on the rest after dinner.” “How about we go out to a movie tonight and you finish up the rest tomorrow?” Dad offered and I raised my eyebrows in surprise. He smiled at me. “It’s been a while since we did anything as a family, and you’ve been working hard today.” “That’d be nice.” I said and he nodded before shutting the door behind him as he left. By Sunday night, the night before school started, I’d confirmed that my relations with my parents were strained at best. I wanted to curse the Brian of this timeline that had apparently made several bad decisions, but that was impossible. He was as gone as if he’d never existed. Now I just had to pick up the pieces of that life. By the end of the weekend, I felt that I had made a good start, although I almost ruined by starting to ask mom about Uncle Rich. He’d lived to the age of seventy-three in the last timeline, but I’d forgotten that he’d be dead of AIDS in this timeline. He’d died right before Christmas in 1981, and when Dad had brought up the idea of selling his apartment in San Francisco, I’d almost asked about him. Apparently the younger me had wanted to sell it, and they had been resisting doing that for the last few years. Now they’d relented and were ready to put it on the market. They were surprised by my ‘sudden change of mind’. “Here are your keys.” Dad said early on Monday morning, as I got ready for school. He was looking at my clothes with a hint of approval. I’d chosen my clothes carefully, picking a good pair of jeans, penny loafers, a dark blue V-neck sleeveless sweater, and a blue dress shirt under that. “Thanks, Dad.” I said as I took the keys to my re-built mustang. I’d only looked at the car so far, but I knew that Brian Breckenridge of any timeline would love to have that car. “Remember, you’re to come right home after school.” He reminded me sternly and I just nodded, hefting my backpack with all my books and completed homework assignments as I left the house. I’d already kissed mom goodbye for the day. The Downey High student parking lot was the same no matter the timeline, and I pulled into the first spot I found, glad that it wasn’t full yet. To my relief, Brandon and Trevor were waiting in the usual spot near the front entrance. Some things didn’t change, at least. “At least you dressed up for her, but where’s Missy?” Trevor asked after we nodded at each other. “What do you mean?” I asked him with a furrow of my eyebrows. “Dude, you fucking ditch her on Saturday after sneaking out from being grounded, and now you don’t even pick her up like you do every morning?” Trevor snorted. “You better get your ass to pick her up or she ain’t gonna put out for you again!” “Oh shit.” I muttered, turning back towards the parking lot before I realized I didn’t even know whom the girl was or where she lived. I started to turn around, but a familiar figure caught my eye as he passed by us on his way inside. His familiar blond hair was long and shaggy, looking like he’d not had it cut in the last few months. It was still that familiar shade of dirty blond though, and his crooked nose stuck out like it always did. I couldn’t see his eyes from this angle, but I took in the faded jean jacket, worn jeans with holes forming, and sneakers that looked like they’d been too close to a fire all with a single glance. He was also a little heftier than I remembered him ever being, but there was no mistaking him for anyone else in the world. “Hey, Davey!” I called out, leaving my two friends to follow the sixteen, almost seventeen, year old version of the man I loved more than life itself. He turned at the sound of his name, and looked at me as if he didn’t recognize me. That was like a knife through the gut, but I put a smile on my face anyway. Davey stood there, silently looking me up and down, and then at the hand I was now sticking out to him. “You’re Davey Jones, right? Didn’t you play on the freshman team before you moved out to…um…” “Nevada.” He answered in a very familiar bass and I wanted to sigh with relief as he took my hand and shook it. “Brian, right?” “Yeah, so you’re back in town, huh?” “Um, yeah, we moved back last year.” He said. “I’m in the same history class as you.” “Oh, um, well I kept on trying to remember where I knew you from and I just realized it was from freshman football.” I said quickly, wishing I was as good at him when it came to dancing with words on the spur of a moment. “Say, you remember Trevor and Brandon, don’t you?” “Yeah.” Davey said as I tried to steer him back towards them. He looked like he was struggling with wanting to leave and wanting to stay, but Trevor ruined the moment. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor called out. “You better hurry or your girlfriend is going to dump you!” “I’ll see you later.” Davey said as he turned and headed inside the school, hanging his head as he went. His shoulders were slumped forward as he walked, and I wondered what would make my Davey walk like that. I’d always known him to stand tall. Even after his stroke, his first struggle had been to hold his head upright and he’d fought and fought until he could hold his head high on his own. Yes, I realized as I turned to talk Brandon into going with me so I’d know where I was going, there were so many things to fix in the here and now. Chapter 2 It was the slap heard around the world, or at least around Downey High. By lunchtime, the entire school seemed to have heard about the scene in the parking lot that morning. Marcie had come flying out of a car, driven by her older brother and rounded on me as I was just unlocking the Mustang’s driver-side door. Hours later, I could still feel the sting of that slap, and wondered what the hell my younger self of this timeline had seen in her. Sure, she was good looking. Davey had often overlooked the fact that I was bisexual more than I was gay, but then he’d never had cause to doubt my love for him. Physically, I could see why I would be interested in Marcie, but her attitude left a lot to be desired. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” She’d yelled at me after slapping me. “First, you blow me off like I’m nothing on Saturday and then you don’t pick me up this morning, making me get a ride from my stupid brother! What’s going on with you, Brian?” “I’m grounded.” I’d growled at her and she’d laughed in this high, shrill tone, throwing her blond hair over her shoulder. She was dressed in this short mini-skirt and tight top that left little to the imagination. Yeah, she definitely had a good body, but everything else was the shits. “What the fuck is that supposed to matter?” She screamed. “Who cares if your idiot parents ground you? You’re supposed to care about me before anyone else, remember?” “Get a grip.” I’d growled, and had gotten another slap before she stormed off without saying another word. Brandon tried to hide his grin behind a hand, but he got a glare from me as I relocked my door and headed back towards the campus. At least now I wouldn’t be late for school. “Dude, you’re going to have to do a lot of making up to her.” Brandon sniggered and I pushed at him with my shoulder as we walked towards my locker. I just hoped the combination wouldn’t be any different than the one I remembered. It wasn’t, and I put my books away without saying another word. I’d have to break up with ‘Marcie’ before too long, but part of me was reticent to do that right away. Davey’s warnings about making too many rapid changes stuck in my head from the times we’d discussed these aspects of time travel. I didn’t want to end up in a mental institution or a government lab. “Did you forget you’re supposed to take me to lunch?” Marcie’s voice pulled me out of my reverie and I turned to look at her with a frown. Apparently I had the same lunch period as her, and she expected me to take her somewhere. Damn, there went my plans to ‘meet’ up with Davey for lunch. “No.” I answered her, trying to put a smile on my face. At that moment I had never missed my Davey so much. How the hell had I ended up with this bitch instead of the calm, loving man I had just spent seven decades of my life with? “Where do you want to go?” “The usual.” She said flatly. “Aren’t you tired of that place yet?” I asked, trying to get her to tell me exactly what ‘the usual’ meant. “No way in hell am I tired of that place.” She frowned. “Everyone sees us together there so they know you’re mine. I thought you liked that. You told me you did.” “Yeah, well, sometimes the food gets old.” I temporized and she frowned even more. “What’s the matter, Brian darling?” She asked in the most sickeningly sweet voice as she stepped up and put her hand on my chest. I wanted to shudder. “You haven’t even kissed me yet, and now you don’t want to go to Furnow’s for lunch?” “Sorry.” I said as I hugged her and planted a kiss on her cheek. A little voice in my head was yammering about this being a betrayal of Davey and it got louder when she tried to kiss me on the mouth. “Dude, you going to lunch?” Brandon’s voice saved me as I jerked my head to look at my friend. Marcie frowned. “Katie and I thought we might join you today.” “That would be good.” I said quickly, ignoring Marcie’s frown. Katie must be the black-haired girl that was with Brandon. She was petite, but had a fair-sized pair of breasts that looked quite confined in the low-necked blouse she was wearing. God, what was wrong with me and my friends that we were dating girls who thought it necessary to show all their assets? Marcie wasn’t happy about the company, but she looped her arm through mine and practically dragged me towards the parking lot. My dislike for her was getting to be extreme, and as I unlocked the passenger door for her, I debated on whether dumping her would be a ‘small’ change or a ‘big’ one. Davey had always said big changes were bad, but if dumping her was a big one, I might have to risk the consequences. Brandon and his girlfriend got in the back seat, and I had to keep a smirk off my face. Trevor and I were bisexual, although he leaned more towards girls as he got older, while Davey, Sean and Brandon had always been gay from everything I’d heard. Sure Brandon had dated, and had sex with girls in high school of the original timeline (according to Sean), but according to Davey, Brandon had come out in college and never looked back. As we were pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed Davey in a blue Pontiac behind us, and kept on eye on the rear-view mirror as he followed us out of the lot. He turned at the first light though, and I lost track of him. I’d learned that he was in my history class, but he had sat on the far side of the room from me and disappeared as soon as the bell rang. Well, there was plenty of time, I kept reminding myself. Still, it hurt seeing him so young again, and not being able to wrap my arms around him, kiss him, or to talk with him all night long. “BRIAN!” Marcie’s screech reminded me I was driving and I slammed on the brakes just in time to keep from slamming into a car that was stopped for a red light. “What’s the matter with you? You’ve been acting all weird since Saturday! Snap out of it!” “Shut up.” I growled at her, and she glared at me, accompanied by the noise of two people in the back seat sucking in their breath in surprise. “What did you say to me?” Marcie’s voice grew dangerously low as a honk from behind told me the light was green and I started driving again. “I’m not a doormat, you know.” I said with a hint of anger in my voice. “Who said you were?” She retorted angrily. “You do with the way you talk to me.” I replied, enjoying the surge of anger and the tingling it brought to my fingers. I’d forgotten how strong emotions were at this age, and it felt good. “I do not.” She huffed as she crossed her arms just below her bosom. “You better take that back right now if you want to keep my love.” “Stop being such a little girl.” I snorted as a fresh wave of anger came over him. I was too old to be dealing with shit like this. “How dare you say that to me?” She roared and made to move as if she was going to open the door. “If you’re going to jump out of the car you better wait until I can pull over.” I said as they pulled to a stop at another light. “Take me back to the school right now!” She demanded and I was only too happy to agree. I’d barely had time to stop the car in a parking spot at the student lot before she was out the door. She paused while waiting for Brandon’s girlfriend to get out. Katie was making sympathetic noises while Brandon and I got out and I waited for whatever was to come next. Once again I wished for the ability to easily deal with people that Davey had possessed, but that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. “What is wrong with you, Brian?” Marcie demanded angrily after stomping around the car and getting in my face. Spittle flew from her lips and landed on my face, but I resisted the urge to wipe it off. “Nothings wrong with me.” I answered after thinking for a moment. “I just don’t like being treated like a doormat.” “How long have we been going out?” She asked, and I froze, sparing a quick glance at Brandon but he didn’t know I needed his help. Her face grew even redder as the silence continued and she realized I couldn’t answer. “You mean you can’t even fucking remember we’ve been going out for nine months now! I gave you my virginity and you can’t tell me how long we’ve gone out but you can tell me you think I’m treating you like a doormat? Well, I got news for you, Brian Breckenridge. If this is the best you can do, you don’t deserve to be dating me!” She turned on her heels and stormed off, pulling Brandon’s girlfriend in her wake. Brandon leaned back against my car, shaking his head and obviously fighting a losing battle with an urge to laugh. More than a few students had seen the tail end of this show, but I wasn’t as concerned with that as I would have been if I was really sixteen, well sixteen going on seventeen real soon. “Dude, what the fuck is up with you?” Brandon asked after he got his laughter under control. Last week you’re all like ‘Oh, she’s the one, Brandon. I love her. We’re going to get married as soon as we’re out of high school!’ Now you’re like ‘you treat me like a doormat!’ What’s going on, bro?” “You don’t think she treats me like a doormat?” I asked and he chuckled. “Dude, something wrong with your memory?” Brandon asked with a shake of his head. “I told you last week you let her walk all over you and I thought you shouldn’t do that. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t telling you to break up with her, but she’s a manipulative bitch.” “Yeah, she is.” I agreed with a sigh, glad to be rid of her. Brandon just stared at me. “Who are you and what have you done with the real Brian Breckenridge?” Brandon asked with wide eyes. “If I’d called her a bitch last week you’d have stomped me into the ground.” “That was last week.” I replied with a shrug, unnerved by the question. Once again Davey Jones was right. You might think it would be easy to pass yourself off as a younger version of the same person, but it was really difficult. “Yeah, well, you want to grab some food from the cafeteria?” Brandon asked. “I’m starving.” “How much time do we have left?” I asked. “Just over a half-hour.” Brandon replied after looking at his watch. “How about fast food?” I suggested. “McDonalds?” Brandon suggested and I nodded. There was one about ten minutes from here, which would let us get there and actually eat if we hurried, although the idea of snarfing down food that quickly would have been impossible for me before I came back in time, I could remember doing that several times in my first youth. “Isn’t that David?” Brandon asked as we waited at the counter for our order. “Who?” I asked and Brandon nodded his head towards one of the guys working behind the counter. Even with his back to me I could recognize the man I loved. Why was he here, wearing that god-awful polyester uniform and serving up food at the McDonald’s drive-thru? “David Jones.” Brandon said. “You were just trying to talk to him this morning when you were supposed to be picking up your girlfriend.” “Ex-girlfriend.” I corrected him while trying to ponder why Davey was working here at this place. Sure, fast food was a good first job for many high school kids. But this was Davey Jones. He was so much better than this. This guy had saved the world several times, gotten his father from being a dead beat to the office of the President of the United States! Hell, Davey had spent five years as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom for Christ sake! “Yeah, ex and all that.” Brandon said as he chuckled again and shook his head slightly. Our order was done and we went to sit down all without Davey having noticed us. As Brandon chatted about the upcoming baseball season and I grunted a few responses, my mind spun around the fact that Davey was here working on what should have been his lunch hour at school. That bugged me more than I wanted to admit. I could remember Davey talking about his life in the original timeline, and maybe once he’d mentioned working at a fast food restaurant, but that had been lifetimes ago for him. It wasn’t as important to who he was when I’d known him as things like the timeline where he and I hadn’t been a couple until that one kiss right before I was killed at the beginning of World War Three. “Dude, you okay?” Brandon asked. “You know, if you get on your knees and beg, Marcie might take you back still.” “Screw that.” I snorted and Brandon smiled. “Good, can’t say she was my favorite person.” Brandon shuddered in mock disgust and I laughed. “You done?” “Yeah, let’s go before we’re late.” I said. “No worries, we have German, remember?” Brandon was chuckling now. “Frau Hostetter thinks you’re the sweetest thing on earth and would never give you a tardy, even if you showed up five minutes before the end of the period.” “Well, let’s not push her today.” I suggested as we got up and threw our garbage away. “With the way things are going she might be having a bad day and decide I’m the sourest thing on earth.” “Yeah, well that’s what Marcie said after you splooged in her mouth.” Brandon laughed as we went out the door. That shocked me and I stared at him. He realized I wasn’t walking with him anymore and turned to face me with a frown. “Oh c’mon, you know that Marcie tells Katie everything. It shouldn’t be a surprise that I’ve heard about the blowjobs you’ve been getting from Marcie for the past eight months, or about you fucking her last week. She’s not a virgin by the way. She was just saying that to make you think it was something special. She told Katie one time that she’d get you to fuck her and then she’d be set for life, something about getting you to sell an apartment you inherited and then using that to buy a house for her and…” “What the fuck.” I snarled as the conversation with my father about selling Uncle Rich’s apartment came to mind. Could my younger self of this time line have been so fucking blind as to let a bitch use him like that? Then something else struck me. “Damn it Brandon, aren’t you supposed to a fucking friend?” “What?” Brandon asked, obviously seeing my face go red with anger and my hands ball up into fists. “Calm down, Brian.” “Calm down?” I fumed. “You knew the bitch was fucking using me like this and you fucking wait to tell me until I’ve broken up with her? What would have happened if I hadn’t broken up with her? Huh? Would you have stood beside me as my best man at the fucking wedding and fucking smiled while she took me for all she could? Is that how good of a friend you are?” “Dude, public place!” Brandon said in a half-whisper, half-shout. Sure, people were looking, but at the moment I didn’t care. “So god damn what!” I shouted. “Tell me, do you think you’re a good friend when you don’t tell me a bitch is sinking her claws into me and taking what’s mine?” “Would you have fucking listened?” Brandon shouted back, his face going darker with his own rage. “You were all wrapped around her finger. She had her hand on your fucking cock and was leading you around by it with your eyes all glazed over and your tongue hanging out of your fucking mouth! Hell, the only reason Trevor or I ever saw you was when she let you ‘play with the boys!’ You might as well have already been married to her! Trevor tried to warn you one time months ago and you didn’t talk to him for two weeks!” “Okay, you’ve got a point.” I said as Brandon’s words deflated the ballooning anger I was feeling. He did a double-take before his body-posture relaxed slightly. “Sorry.” “So am I, but you’re better off without her.” Brandon said. “There’s plenty of better girls out there, you know.” “I know.” I said as I headed for the car. I waited until we got inside before deciding to drop a bombshell on him. This should be pretty safe, after all Davey had told me that it had been pretty constant in all the timelines. As I started the car I turned to leer at him. “Who knows, maybe I’ll give guys a chance instead of dealing with bitchy women.” “Dude, not even funny.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “As many fags as you’ve beaten up over the years, none of them would think anything except that you were going to stick them in a trash can again.” “Well, there’s always you or Trevor.” I said as I backed the car out and headed back to school. “I ain’t a fag, and neither is Trevor.” Brandon said with a hint of fear in his voice. A quick glance showed that his face was white, not red with anger. “Trevor’s not a fag, he’s bisexual.” I said. “What?” Brandon squeaked and I had to resist the urge to laugh. Suddenly I understood something about Davey, far too late to share with him. Well maybe I could share it with him in a few months, or years, although it wouldn’t be exactly the same Davey. God how he must have loved doing this, letting little tidbits drop to his friends about the future, tweaking their noses with knowledge about them there was no way he should have known. It was fun! “Please, surely you don’t think I had no idea what’s been going on in Trevor’s barn, do you?” My voice was dripping with sarcasm as the anger of earlier leaked out. That was another thing Davey had mentioned but I hadn’t understood until now. Our bodies impacted how we behaved, and the younger body of mine had a whole lot more hormones and stuff floating around in it than the body I’d left in the last timeline. As a result, I was reacting more from emotions than calm, cool, collected planned words. “Uh, I, uh…dude.” Brandon stuttered and the last word was more whisper than anything else. As I pulled into the parking lot, his face was as white as it could be and I decided to take pity on him. “Let’s talk later.” I said with a soft smile. “Maybe during P.E. if we can swing it? I’m still grounded so the old man expects me back home right after school.” “Uh, yeah, sure.” Brandon said weakly as we got out of the car. He didn’t even look at me and I began to regret what I’d done. The difference in perspective was striking, between being openly gay as an adult and in the boiling cauldron that was a high school. I should have realized that, but I’d been caught up in the moment. Now it was too late to undo what I’d done, unless I somehow managed to put together a time machine, but that was an impossibility. It was just after Algebra II that a thin brown-haired girl wearing a skimpy top and very tight jeans accosted me. She had a bright smile on her face and was trying to simper like Joan Collins from Dynasty, but it wasn’t working on me as she stood in my way. Her name flowed up from long-forgotten memories of another time. “What is it, Laurie?” I asked her after she hadn’t spoken but stayed in my way. “Is it true?” She asked. “Did Marcie really dump you?” “I hope so.” I said before I could catch the words from forming on my lips. Her smile grew brighter. “So you could like, ask someone else out now?” She asked with a perkiness that was altogether too fake for me. “I’m grounded by my parents thanks to her.” I answered, barely registering the pouty expression on her face before stepping around her and heading to my locker. I passed Marcie in the hallway and got a glare from her as she saw me, but that didn’t stop her from storming over to me. “I need to get my things from your locker, asshole.” She demanded in a voice that cut over the buzz of students passing by us in the crowded hallways. “Fine, I’ll put them in a box and have Katie give them to you.” I replied and she started to say something but I moved off too quickly for her. The whole situation felt weird, like a page out of someone else’s life, which it was in a very real way. Davey and I should have been a couple for two years now. It was time for P.E. and for me to have my ‘chat’ with Brandon, and probably Trevor. Both of them were giving me sharp looks as we changed for class, but when it came time to line up for roll call I received my first surprise. Coach Cole, who was the former Navy Master Chief I remembered from the last timeline was calling out roll and he called out Davey’s name twice before shaking his head and muttering to himself. This P.E. section was usually for guys who played on sports teams. It let us leave school earlier for away games, and also kept us from being as able to pick on the little guys. That was something I remembered clearly. I also remembered Davey telling me he hadn’t played sports in this original timeline after coming back to Downey, so why was he in this class? Another important question, since I’d just seen him at work during lunch was he skipping class in order to work? I remember he dropped out sometime this year, and he’d claimed it had begun when he needed to work more hours, but this was the first day of school after Winter Break. “Okay, we’re doing basketball today.” Coach Cole said. “Let’s get through the warm-ups and then we’ll divide you up into teams.” That effectively killed my plans to chat with Brandon and Trevor. They knew it as well and Brandon gave me a terse ‘after class’. Maybe I could get away with being a little bit late getting home. If not, well screw it, this was a little more important at the moment. Halfway through the period while I was taking a breather on the side of the court and Brandon was in the game, I got a chance to approach Master Chief Cole. He was watching the game and making some ticks on his clipboard. There were actually three games going on with the size of the class, but he was the teacher on our court. “Master Chief, can I ask you something?” I asked and he stared at me for a moment. “You planning on joining the NJROTC, Breckenridge?” Cole asked with a little bit of humor in his eyes. “I’ll be honest, we could use someone like you. Last semester there were barely enough kids to keep it going. Think you could convince your two buddies to join as well?” “I…uh…I’ll talk to them.” I stuttered with surprise. I’d forgotten how… pushy he could be about his NJROTC. I also remembered that Davey’s sister had been a big member of that group in the last timeline. Yeah, that would be good. “Good, we’re meeting tomorrow after school.” Cole said with a nod and I realized how easily he had drafted me. Oh well, I still remembered how to march just fine and all the other crap that went with his little club. Besides, it’d give me more time away from grounding. “What about when baseball starts?” I asked as another thought struck me. “You’re going out for the team this year?” He asked with surprise. “You skipped it last year.” “Yeah, well, Marcie and I broke up today.” I said with a shrug, deciding there were a lot of things I could blame the girlfriend for. “Hate to say it, but I think that’s a good thing.” Cole said with a shudder. He had my full agreement on that. “Anything else?” “Yeah, when you called out attendance, you shook your head at the fact that Davey Jones wasn’t here…” I let my voice trail off and he gave me a sharp look. “I didn’t know you were friends with him.” Cole answered after a moment of silence. “I…I’m not. Yet.” I answered honestly. “I knew him a bit back when we were freshmen and he played on the football team.” “He any good?” Cole asked and I had to think for a moment to how Davey described his football abilities in this timeline, not necessarily how it had been in ours. “He could be if he made the effort and had some help.” That answer should be accurate. “Well, he won’t be eligible to play anyway the way he’s going right now.” Cole said with a grimace and he gave me a long look. “Breckenridge, I don’t know why I’m going to tell you this because at the end of last year I’d pretty much written you off as a pussy-whipped boy without a brain of your own, but you strike me as having changed a bit over the break.” “More than you can imagine.” I muttered and almost regretted it when I realized he heard what I said. That got me a look of curiosity, but he shrugged it off when I didn’t offer anything. “So, your friend, Jones.” Cole said softly. “He pulled a ‘C’ in this class last semester because he was at the limits of excused absences already. His absence today makes him even with the number of excused absences for the entire year. If he misses three more days, or fifteen individual classes like he’s been doing, he’ll get expelled.” “For missing classes?” I asked with surprise and Cole nodded. “It’s in the student guide, Breckenridge.” Cole answered. “He got suspended two weeks before finals and I think he was happy about it. If he doesn’t turn his head around and start paying attention, he’ll be out the door and in alternative education by the end of the month. His mom’s probably getting a phone call personally from the principal right now.” “Oh.” I said, dumbstruck by the news. “It’s time for you to get back on the court.” Cole said, ending the conversation. I made a couple of stupid mistakes in the game, mostly because my mind was spinning with the news of Davey’s problems at school. Until now, I’d been thinking I had plenty of time, weeks or months to get to know him and encourage him to make some good changes, but now… now I knew I didn’t have that much time at all and I was still grounded. “Let’s go.” Brandon said fifteen minutes later as everyone else was milling about the locker room, getting ready to take showers. He and Trevor had just kept on their P.E. sweats as they met me at my locker. I just nodded and followed them out after putting my clothes into a gym back and looping it over my shoulder. There was a mess of people leaving, so we made our way to the baseball field’s dugout where they sat on the bench and stared at me while I leaned back against the metal bars on the field side. “So what’s this shit about you thinking we’re fags?” Trevor said with a frown after we’d all remained silent for a while. “I never said it like that.” I said defensively. “You’ve never used anything but fag or fudgepacker to talk about people like that.” Brandon pointed out. “Since when have you used anything else?” I shot back as a flash of anger welled up. A deep breath calmed it down. Damn it to hell, I was an adult, not a kid! “Look, let’s calm down here. We’ve been friends for half our lives already, right?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with his eyes squinting at me and his arms crossed. “Of course as soon as you and Marcie started going out it was like we ceased to exist unless you needed us for something with her.” “Then let me say I’m sorry about that.” I said with a frown. “I was stupid to let anyone, especially a bitch like that put our friendship in danger.” “You mean it, don’t you?” Brandon asked with his head cocked to the side and a look of surprise on his face. I nodded. “Fine, I accept your apology.” “As long as you don’t do the same thing with another bitch.” Trevor added with a hint of sulkiness. “You don’t have to worry about that, Trev.” I said with a smile and he smirked at me. “You really turning queer on us?” Trevor asked with a smirk. “If I was, I’d trust the two of you to be cool with it.” I said with a smile but they frowned at that. “I don’t know why you think…” Trevor started to protest while Brandon looked at the ground but I interrupted him. “You two started doing it with each other the summer before seventh grade, right?” I asked and they both looked up at me with shocked expressions. “Jesus, Trevor, your parents aren’t stupid people. Do you really think they missed you going out to the barn?” “They know?!” Trevor’s voice actually cracked at that. “They told you?” “No, but they’ve guessed.” I said with a shrug. “You know, they have to be cool about it if they haven’t said anything.” “Dude, your parents know.” Brandon’s voice was a hoarse whisper as Trevor shook his head. “I’m never going to be able to look them in the eyes again.” Trevor mumbled before looking up at me. “Dude, if you’ve known, why didn’t you ever say anything? I mean, I’m not really queer, you know, but I do like getting it where I can. I guess you could say I’m tri-sexual you know…I’ll try anything at least once…” “Yeah, okay.” I said with a nod and a smile. “Whatever works for you bro. It’s your business, not mine, okay?” “Yeah.” Trevor grunted. “Dude, you’ve always hated queers or anything smacking of stuff like that. What’s changed you?” “I can’t really say.” I said, not really wanting to lie to them, but neither did I want to tell them everything yet. They were different people than those I’d known for so long before. It would be smart to get to know them a little better. “I remember the first time I heard you say the word ‘fag’.” Brandon said softly, his eyes meeting mine after a long moment. “It was about this time of year during seventh grade. You came back from Christmas Break and you were like really pissed off. When I put a hand on your shoulder you told me ‘stop that fag shit’ and to leave you alone.” “I remember that.” Trevor said. “We thought you weren’t going to be friends with us anymore, but you started hanging out with us again later that month.” “My Uncle Rich died that Christmas.” I said with a heavy sigh. That was one story Davey had told clearly, how during his first time travel, what he called the second timeline, Uncle Rich had died as well only he’d been there that time. “I’ve never heard of him.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “I think I remember you talking about going to see him during the sixth grade.” Trevor said with a glazed look in his eyes as if he was trying to remember. “You never mentioned him again, though.” “My mom and dad always thought it was best if I didn’t mention my gay uncle at school.” Brian said, remembering that from his own childhood and guessing it applied here. “They weren’t ashamed of him, but they didn’t want me to get into fights when other kids said something bad about him if they knew I had a gay uncle.” “That makes sense.” Brandon snorted. “Yeah, well he died from AIDS that Christmas and I got a little angry.” I said, guessing from knowing how I would have reacted if my Uncle Rich had died. “Oh, shit, I’m sorry dude.” Brandon said as he stood and moved to put a hand on my shoulder. There were tears in my eyes as I realized that in this reality, I wouldn’t have Uncle Rich around like he’d been until I was in my sixties. Brandon ‘s hand stopped halfway to my shoulder, and he looked like he was afraid for a moment, but I solved that for him by reaching out and bringing him into a hug. A moment later Trevor joined us. “So this is what’s been bugging you ever since then?” Trevor asked softly. “Yeah.” I answered. “Sucks, don’t it?” “Yeah.” Brandon replied. “I know thinking about getting that fucking thing scares me shitless sometimes.” “That’s why you cover your stump before you hump.” I joked as the hug broke up and we all grinned at each other. “So did Marcie turn you off girls so much you’re going to do guys now?” Brandon asked. “I think you should keep it quiet if you, you know. I’m not about to have everyone think my best friend’s a fag.” “Is that why you went after that Jones guy this morning?” Trevor asked with a thoughtful look on his face. “I mean, I’m not sure how you’d know that he and I did the deed last semester, but he does have a pretty hot mouth.” “Dude!” Brandon laughed. “I had him give me a blow job freshman year. You remember when he was on crutches after Ruiz tackled him in practice? The day after Brian and Jay Collins threw that kid who had freckles all over his body into the trash can, my mom gave him a ride home and I stayed there for most of the night. He blew me while I laid back on his waterbed. It was pretty good.” Their words, each and every one of them struck home as I listened and tears came to my eyes again. My Davey… we’d been virgins that first time, or at least he’d physically been a virgin. I knew in his first life we’d never ended up with each other, but I’d never thought he’d have done it with… our friends. Had he secretly looked at them while we were dating and remembered what he’d done with them? “Brian?” Trevor’s voice got my attention. “You okay bud? That didn’t gross you out did it? Or are you upset because you thought you’d be the first to bag Jones?” “Um, I’m fine.” I said after clearing my head with several deep breaths. No, it was as much my fault as anything Davey might have done. If I’d gone back further, to 1981, maybe, I could have stopped all this from happening. Instead, I had to deal with the world as it was now, and go from there. Davey had done all these, and probably more, in the original timeline and still ended up with me in the second, and had stayed faithful to me, except the time I rejected him. No, I couldn’t let what I’d just heard poison my love for him. He had told me once that a lot of the things he went through as a late teenager, after his father’s arrest had made him the man he was when he went back in time. I couldn’t begrudge those experiences altogether, could I, if they had produced the man who’d made me so happy for so many years? “So, what now?” Brandon asked in worried tone as he looked at me. “I mean, Brian, you’ve been a good friend, but what does this mean?” “Who knows?” I asked in a voice almost as soft. “As far as I’m concerned, the rest of the world doesn’t need to know our business, right? We’re friends, good friends, and what we share with each other doesn’t go no further, right?” “Right.” Brandon and Trevor said in unison. “Now I have to go.” I said with a smile. “I’m already supposed to be home and I’m still grounded.” “See ya tomorrow, Bri.” Trevor said, patting me on the back as I took off from the dugout and headed back out to the car. It was as I was driving off that the location of our talk triggered a memory of another talk, and the things that had been said. Almost, I turned around to tell my friends the rest of the story, remembering Sean, but I didn’t. There was too much else going on right now. Chapter 3 “Your mother says that you were twenty minutes late getting home today.” Dad said as we sat at the dinner table, eating honey-glazed chicken with rice and steamed vegetables. My mother’s cooking was something I’d really missed without realizing it as the years had gone by in the last timeline. There were plenty of times when I’d had a bad day and come home to make something like this, something that reminded me of being a kid, protected by my parents’ love. Davey always called it comfort food. “Yes, I was.” I admitted cautiously, unsure of where he was going from the neutral expression on his face. “You did well this weekend, Brian.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “I want to hear what you thought was a good enough reason to risk ruining that progress by being late today.” “I… it’s been an eventful day.” I answered honestly. They just frowned at me for a moment and I let out another sigh as I sat back, trying to meet both of their eyes while twiddling my fork around my plate. “Marcie and I broke up.” “You don’t seem too heartbroken.” Dad said while both of them struggled to not smile over the news. “I thought… I thought after the reason you were grounded that you were going to go on and marry her once you’re out of high school.” “No way in hell.” I growled, surprised at the vehemence that came with the thought. “Watch your language, son.” Mom said, but there was no anger or sharpness in her voice, and her lips were quivering upwards. “I can’t believe I ever dated someone like… her.” I said even more vehemently. They were both smiling openly now. “Why didn’t you stop me?” “We tried.” Dad said with a sigh, and although his lips quirked downward for a moment he didn’t sound too angry. “Was she pushing you to sell the apartment?” “Yes.” I admitted, shaking my head. “I’m just glad I woke up in time. That apartment… it’s all I really have left of Uncle Rich in this world, isn’t it?” “Brian!” Mom’s voice sounded shocked, but there was a very soft smile on her face and tears in her eyes. “That’s the first time in years that you’ve mentioned him without cursing or looking like you wanted to hit something!” “I’m sorry mom.” I said softly, apologizing for the behavior of the ‘me’ from this timeline. “I… well sorry doesn’t cut it… but I miss him too.” “I do too, honey.” Mom said sadly. “We knew you were hurting from losing him, but every time we reached out to you, you turned us away.” “But that’s in the past now, I think.” Dad said with a tone of approval and he looked me over. “I think you’ve done some growing, and while I don’t approve of what brought this all to a head, I do approve of the results so far. We can forgive you being late since you were dealing with breaking up from a bad relationship.” “Actually, that was dead before lunch was over.” I said with a snort, remembering how… angry the cow had been. “Then why were you late?” Dad asked patiently. “I… I was talking with Brandon and Trevor about things.” I answered honestly, hoping he wouldn’t ask too many details. “I haven’t been the best son to you over the last few years, and I haven’t been the best of friends to them either.” “Now that’s an even better reason to be twenty minutes late.” Dad said with a smile that surprised me. “So, what else is going on with you?” “Master Chief Cole’s expecting me to join his Sea Scouts this semester.” I began and they looked confused for a moment. “You mean Coach Cole from your football team?” Dad asked. “Yeah.” I confirmed. “They’re having problems getting enough students, and well he asked me to join and I’m thinking about it. I’d need permission obviously, and well, it would mean coming home later a couple times a week, and probably leaving a little early as well.” “Are you doing this to get out of being grounded?” Dad asked and I shook my head. “Grounding won’t last little more than a week while the Sea Scouts thing goes on all semester and maybe even next year.” I answered him and he shrugged. “Good, because if you’re going to do it, you’re doing it all semester.” Dad said while mom nodded her agreement. “Anything else?” “Yeah.” I said as I shifted in my seat and played with the remaining food on my plate a little bit more. Suddenly I wasn’t very hungry and I was wondering if I should even discuss this with them, but they were my parents and I knew they could always help. “What is it, Brian?” Mom asked with a slightly worried frown. “I saw someone I haven’t seen in a while.” I answered. “He went to La Loma with Brandon, Trevor and me and he played on the freshman football team with us before his family moved to Nevada. He’s back at Downey now, and well, I don’t know how to describe it, but he looked kind of down, you know?” “What’s his name?” Mom asked with a tilt of her blond head. “Davey Jones.” I answered and she creased her eyebrows. “That sounds so familiar.” Mom muttered while Dad frowned. “Was his father a preacher?” Dad asked and I knew he recognized the name. “Yes.” I answered and Dad sighed. “Honey, you remember the story from last year.” Dad said to Mom. “David Jones Sr. was a local pastor who moved out to Nevada until his wife found out he was molesting their daughter. He came back to California and pled guilty to the molesting and was placed on house arrest.” “That’s right and there was something in the paper yesterday about him being arrested for violating the terms of his parole.” Mom said as she slapped her hand on the table in triumph. “He went too close to a school or something like that. Funny, they never mentioned he had a son.” “Yeah, well, Davey, I don’t know.” I said softly. “He’s not the same as I remembered him, like he was all hunched in on himself. Plus, he’s working at a McDonald’s near school, and missing classes because of it. Coach Cole said if he doesn’t start going to all of his classes soon they’ll kick him to alternative education.” “What does this have to do with you?” Dad asked. “I… I feel like I’ve spent the last few years being selfish, you know?” I answered, trying to sound as young as possible instead of older, wiser. “I saw Davey today when all the stuff with Marcie was going down and well, I began to wonder. We kind of knew each other years ago, and he’s a pretty cool guy, but since he came back he’s all withdrawn. Before… without Marcie, I might have tried to be a friend and maybe he wouldn’t look so… defeated.” “What do you want from us?” Dad asked. “An extra two hours after school before I have to be home?” I asked and Dad’s face started to cloud over. It was time to speak quickly. “If you’re willing to give me an extra two hours, I think it would be fair to also extend my being grounded a week.” “Even if that means you can’t have a birthday party?” Mom asked. “Yeah.” I agreed. “What about the Sea Scouts thing?” Dad asked. “The afternoon stuff counts as part of the extra two hours?” I offered. “The morning stuff counts as school time?” “Deal.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Thanks for letting me bargain.” I said with a smile and he laughed. The rest of the evening passed pretty quickly with me spending most of it on homework. Assignments from the first day weren’t too bad, but there was a lot of little things I had to review from the last semester so I would be current on what was being taught. Towards the end of the evening, I watched the Cosby Show with my parents, experiencing déjà vu from watching the old program that was now being run for the first time in this timeline. All the while my mind was plotting out different ways to reach out to Davey in this timeline, the way he’d reached out to me. It would have been so much easier to just bump into him like we’d done on the bike path in my own timeline, but that was years ago even here. No, something else was required, and I had to remember something else Davey had said about how he’d been in this timeline. Very, very closeted. His sleeping with Brandon and Trevor, as well as several other guys most likely (and even one or two girls from what he’d told me one time) was all one-time affairs. Most of the people he slept with during high school he never talked to again, from what he told me. That was probably one of the reasons he wasn’t friends with Brandon or Trevor, because after having had sex with them, he actively kept them at arms-length. He’d never exactly explained why, but I guessed it had to do with him not wanting to admit he was gay. So long as he wasn’t faced with daily reminders of his ‘weakness’ in having slept with them, he was able to pretend like it never happened until the next time. That would fit something I’d heard from many gay men who’d grown up in the eighties. It was also something I’d have to help Davey overcome eventually. No, for now I’d have to work at just being his friend and nothing more. That night I dreamed about Davey, as might be expected. Only, the Davey I dreamed about was the man I’d grown old with. After his stroke, he’d lost control of his bodily functions and so it had been necessary to put an adult diaper on him when he came home. I think, more than anything else that had embarrassed him deeply. I’d seen it in his eyes, and the way he tried to protest every time I carefully removed a fouled diaper, cleaned him up, and then put a new one on him. Sometimes he’d close his eyes and stretch his head back as if pretending it wasn’t happening, and other times he’d look at me with eyes that provided a glimpse into his tortured soul. I knew Davey Jones and the proud man he’d been, and I knew how much his need for help with even the most basic of needs shamed him. That was why I would never let anyone else change him, and made sure the physical therapists got him to the point that he could sit on a toilet again. He still needed help transferring from the wheelchair to the toilet, and I still wiped his butt for him, but he no longer had to wear the diaper. Those were small victories, but each of them had helped rid his eyes of that shame, and restored to me the proud man I loved with all my heart. In my dream, though, the look in Davey’s eyes was the same, but his body was that of the teenager I’d seen the day before. The dream was still fresh and vivid in my mind as I showered the next morning and dressed in a nice blue and white striped shirt with a pair of nice stonewashed jeans. Yes, Davey had always had a great amount of pride, and I could well imagine how much of a beating it was taking right now. Way back in 2006 of the last timeline, a scandal had erupted just forty days before the mid-term elections. On of Davey’s Aunts, from his mother’s side, had been arrested in Las Vegas for a pyramid scheme and embezzling money from a property management company she worked for as a manager. It was only another scandal, this time on the Republican side, which had ended the relentless attacks on President Jones for the illegal acts of his sister-in-law. It was the closest to an outright scandal that they’d had to deal with, and I’d seen a look of hurt in Davey’s eyes. The night of the election, we’d both gotten drunk off our asses at our D.C. home and he’d told me how much he’d always hated that aunt. Apparently she’d caused countless problems for him in the original timeline, and was someone he actually despised. He’d also shared how awful his family had been in that timeline, which was now the timeline in which I was living. The mirror on the back of my door helped me to make sure that I was looking good today. I couldn’t help whistling as I grabbed my car keys and left my bedroom. Mom was in the kitchen, and Dad was at the table with a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I grabbed a glass of orange juice and the cereal mom had out on the counter and sat at the table to eat. “Good morning.” Dad said as I sat down. He put down his paper long enough to find another section and push it in my direction. “There’s something in there you might want to read.” “Why do I have the feeling it’s not going to be good?” I asked rhetorically. It was the Metro section of the Modesto Bee, and below the fold it had a picture of David Jones, Sr. as well as a headline of “Former Pastor Released”. Davey’s father had been released from jail after it had been found that he’d not violated the terms of his parole. He was living with his mother, who lived a block from a school. The parole officer on his case had authorized him to live there, and he’d been on his way home from the neighborhood store when a police officer had arrested him. “Ah, crap.” I murmured, feeling sorry for Davey and his family for having to constantly go through this crap. The only reason the paper paid any attention to this was because Davey’s father had been a preacher. Then again, if something like this had happened in the last timeline, there would have been an even greater furor. “You still thinking of trying to be friends with him again?” Dad asked as I finished reading the paper and set it back down. “Yeah.” I said with certainty that was far firmer than he had any clue of it being. “This only makes me feel worse, you know? He’s been going through all this crap and I don’t see him hanging around other people at school. It must be pretty lonely.” “I’d imagine a lot of people wouldn’t want to be associated with someone whose father was in the papers for this kind of stuff.” Dad said and I nodded my agreement while chewing on some cereal. “I have to be off to work, but good luck.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. “Honey, you know you can invite him over anytime you want, even if you are grounded.” Mom said as I finished my cereal and took it back to the sink. “Are you sure?” I asked, surprised at how nice they were being. Then again, these were my parents, bleeding heart liberals, and I should have known better than to be surprised. It seems I’d forgotten just how caring they were. “Definitely.” Mom said with a smile. “I feel like I’ve got my old Brian back.” If she only knew. “There you are!” Marcie was not the sight I wanted to see this early in the morning on the front steps of the school. She was standing there with Brandon and Trevor, as well as their girlfriends Katie and Lisa, both friends of Marcie. Today Marcie was dressed in another mini-skirt, with a tube top barely covered by a jean jacket and more of that Madonna-style lace crap. She must have wasted at least ten bucks of make-up on her face as well, and I had to squelch the desire to tell her she was looking like a cheap whore. Instead I just approached the group while keeping an eye out for Davey. “Good morning.” I said in as neutral a tone as possible. “I wanted to talk to you.” Marcie said. “I’ve thought it over, and I’m willing to give you another chance if you apologize to me in front of our friends. You better make it good though if you want me to forgive you and take you back.” “You’re kidding, right?” I said as a laugh escaped my lips. She gave me a death-ray style glare while putting her hands on her hips. Oh my, she was not amused at all. “What the hell’s gotten into you?” She nearly screeched as one of her hands ended up waggling a finger in my face. “You’re like a totally different person! Don’t you remember how important you are to me? You need to treat me better.” “Shut up.” I growled as I slapped her waggling finger out of my eyesight. She seemed shocked enough by that, and her mouth flopped open. “You listen to me for a moment, woman. I’m not some toy you can play with when you feel like it, and I sure as hell am not about to spend the next forty years working my ass off so you can sit on a couch watching soap operas and eating bon-bons like Peggy Bundy! If you thought I was your meal ticket to an easy fucking life, you sure as hell should have treated me better than you have been. As for taking you back, you can apologize all you want but I want nothing more to do with you!” “Fuck you!” She yelled. Her face had been getting redder and redder as I yelled, and I was relieved that was all she had to say before she stomped into the school. Katie and Lisa followed her, and I was left with my two friends, who were both staring at me like I’d gone crazy. “What?” I snapped at them and relaxed as Trevor started to snigger. “Dude, that picture you painted of her on the couch… that’s fucking classic!” Trevor said around his sniggers. “Just one thing, who is Peggy Bundy?” Brandon asked as he started to chuckle. “Oh, yeah, um just somebody I made up.” I said with a shrug. Damn that was right, Married with Children wasn’t on television yet. Oh well, it still worked to drive her off and make sure she had no illusions that it was still possible to get back with me. Several dozen people must have heard me yelling at her. “Dude, you know she’s going to be a bitch for the next few weeks, don’t ya?” Trevor asked and I nodded. “So will our girlfriends.” Brandon said. “We might have to join you in exploring the dark side.” “Your choice, dude.” I replied with an easy smile. “The only thing is, I think both of you have already been there a lot more than me.” “Let’s head inside.” Trevor said and we followed him into the school. The girls weren’t in sight and I sighed with relief as we headed to our lockers. Both of theirs were near each other while mine was in another hallway. To my surprise, Davey was there, just a few feet down from Trevor’s. “Hey Jones.” Trevor called out. “Hey.” Davey said cautiously, his eyes glancing to the three of us. “Hey, I heard your dad was in the paper the other day.” Brandon said in a teasing tone and rage surged through me as I saw Davey turn white before looking away in shame. He slammed his locker shut and started to turn at the same moment I swung out with my arm and elbowed Brandon so hard he flew against the lockers with a loud clatter. As I faced Brandon and used my forearm to pin him against the lockers, I noticed Davey turning back to look at what was going on. “Dude, that is so fucking uncool!” I nearly shouted as my face flushed with my anger. Brandon had a surprised look on his face, as did Trevor. From this position I couldn’t see Davey, but that wasn’t important. “What?” Brandon gasped out. “How could you be so fucking mean?” I asked, surprised at the way I was cussing. It wasn’t something I’d done much of in the last few decades. “Mean?” Brandon gasped as I relaxed a bit and removed my arm from his throat. He straightened up a bit, grimacing as he stretched his back. “Dude, those fucking locks probably left a mark on my back! What the fuck did you do that for?” “You fucking pissed me off.” I fumed. “How the fuck could you do that to someone?” “Do what?” Brandon asked. “What you said to Davey.” I reminded him and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I just mentioned the article about his father.” Brandon stated. “What’s the big deal?” “How the hell would you feel if your family’s business was plastered all over the paper?” I asked him and Brandon looked like he didn’t understand. Neither did Trevor for that matter. “Dude, what the fuck’s gotten into you?” Trevor asked, moving to stand next to Brandon. I took a quick look around in time to see Davey’s back as he disappeared around a corner, while there were several other students watching us in the quickly filling corridor. “Think about what it must be like from his perspective.” I urged my two friends in a hoarse whisper. “Imagine if it was your father in the paper like that and everyone around you knowing the shit that was going on in your family.” “My father would never have done something like that.” Trevor snorted. “Mine either.” Brandon said with disdain. “Besides, if he’s going to go all sensitive every time someone mentions his father he’s going to have a lot of bad times before he graduates.” “Especially with idiots like you around.” I said furiously, ignoring the look of hurt on Brandon’s face as I spun around and stalked down the hallways towards my locker. My mind was spinning with a lot of thoughts, but most of them centered around Brandon and Trevor. They had been our best friends growing up, always there with us, always supportive and strong. How much of that had been because of Davey’s influence on us? Sean’s as well, but I had to wonder just how much of what I viewed as our moral strength during high school had been because of the influence of the two time travelers? How much change could I make in my friends who were currently stereotypical high school jocks more interested in the next game and dipping their dick in a hole than in understanding people? By the time history class rolled around, I hadn’t come up with any definitive answers, but I did know that I would be staying away from Trevor and Brandon for a while. They’d been giving me odd looks all morning, and from the way their girlfriends were whispering to them in the hallways between classes, I was quite convinced they were being given some ultimatums. Up until I walked into the history classroom, I was ready to mark the day off as a complete failure. A question to a girl in my last class who also had this class had confirmed that there was no set seating assignment, so when I saw Davey sitting in a desk against the wall closest to the door, I took the seat behind him and immediately turned so my back was on the wall. He sat in his desk normally, and had hunched his shoulders as soon as I sat down. The teacher was standing at the blackboard, writing something on the board while more students filed into the classroom. A thick-set geek with brown hair gave me a dirty look when he saw me sitting where I was, but didn’t say anything as he found another seat. “You ever wonder if George Lucas sat in one of these desks?” I asked of no one in particular, although I was facing the girl who had been in my last class. Ronna, that was her name, and if I remembered correctly she was a friend of Davey’s in this timeline as well as the one I came from. She’d been there when I first met Davey, well besides that baseball game. “Huh?” She asked. “You know, George Lucas.” I said, grateful that someone at least had responded. Davey was still hunched forward, but out of the corner of my eye I saw him shift slightly in his seat. “The guy who made Star Wars and American Graffiti.” “I know who he is.” Ronna said with a hint of scorn in her voice. “Why would he have sat in one of these desks and why wonder about it?” “These desks are old enough to have been here when he was.” I said with a snort and she actually giggled. Davey’s shoulders started to move like he was on the verge of laughing. He was wearing the same jean jacket as the day before, but the jeans he was wearing today looked to be in better condition, although he still had on the half-melted tennis shoes. “They probably were.” Ronna agreed with me. She had long, dark hair and was pretty. She was a little hefty, but not too badly overweight. “I knew someone who went to school with him.” Davey’s voice was almost inaudible, but he turned slightly in his seat to look at Ronna and then me. His face was devoid of any expression, as if he was afraid of what would happen if he showed something. “She lived on a ranch a couple miles down from my house back in Nevada. Her husband taught me how to ride a horse. She said she thought Lucas was nothing but a weird freak in school and now she wished she’d asked him out.” “I bet she does.” I said with a laugh and almost regretted it when he winced for a moment before a slow smile formed on his face. That was the moment the bell chose to ring and it was time for class. As the instructor turned around and I began to read the assignment on the board, I wondered just how the Brian of this timeline had ended up in a college-prep History course. Sure, some of the classes were college-prep, but not all of them were as they were when I had gone through high school. Whatever the reason, I was just glad that I was in the class with Davey as I turned to face forward in my seat. “On the board is the outline of your semester-long project.” Mr. Wansor said in a bored tone. “Be sure to write it down accurately as it will account for half your grade this semester. You may work on this individually or in pairs, but I warn you that if you choose to work with someone there will be no changing partners or going solo unless one of you dies. You will note that there are several due dates for this assignment, the first in just three weeks when you will turn in an outline of your project. Missing a deadline reduces that portion of the grade by one step. Each deadline counts for five percent of your grade on the project with your final presentation being ten percent. Instead of a written final in this class, you will give your project presentation. Now that you’ve written the assignment down, let’s open our textbooks to page thirteen and start with a discussion on the second Constitutional Congress.” The class was a typical one with the teacher trying to drag answers out of the students and getting monosyllabic answers instead of the erudite philosophy he probably dreamed about getting. Deep down I felt sorry for him, and halfway through class I raised my hand and gave him a five-minute answer to one of his questions. Then Ronna spoke up to argue about something I said, and to my surprise Davey responded to her statement by defending my point about the inclusion of slavery being necessary for that time and place, no matter how disgusting it was as an institution. That got Reggie, who I remembered from the football team involved when he called Davey a ‘racist’. Before I could defend Davey on that topic, Davey snorted and shook his head before shooting Reggie a look of contempt. “If you can’t listen to a white guy talking about the institution of slavery with honesty instead of bleating only about the horror of it, then maybe you should take a deep look at yourself.” Davey’s voice dripped with sarcasm that was so familiar I started to get hard. This was a glimpse of the Davey Jones I knew, cocksure to a fault, and full of derision for people whose viewpoints he disdained. Sure, Davey had hidden it a lot, but there had been more than a few times over the years that he’d unleashed it at people. His ambassadorial confirmation hearing had been one such event, when he verbally lashed out a freshman Republican Senator who was trying to make a name for herself. Davey had figuratively picked her up, spanked her bottom and sat her back down gently while extracting a promise from her that she’d behave like a grown up instead of a schoolyard bully trying to look good for the cameras. “Oh yeah?” Reggie said angrily. “I ain’t the one sittin’ here defending slavery.” “I am not defending slavery, as you would know if you bothered to really listen to what I’m saying.” Davey said. “Slavery was, and is, a horrible crime on the conscience of humanity. That doesn’t change the fact that if the founding fathers of this country had tried to get rid of it back then, there wouldn’t have been a United States today, nor a United States that would fight a bloody civil war during which the abolition of slavery would occur!” “I think that is enough for the moment.” Mr. Wansor ended the debate in a stern voice, but there was a smile on his face. The bell rang at that moment and Reggie was one of the first ones out of the classroom, giving Davey a glare as he left. Davey let out a long breath before picking up his books. As he stood, his shoulders slumped again and the breath of life that had filled him during class seemed to drain away with his exhalation. “Hey, Davey, wait a moment.” I called out as I picked up my own books and rushed out after him. He stopped long enough to turn around and glare at me for a moment. “It’s David.” He said in a low voice. “What?” I asked, confused for a moment. “My name, it’s David, not Davey.” He explained. “Oh, I thought…” I stammered. “What are you trying to do?” He asked, oblivious to the stream of people filling the hallway and trying to get past us. “Huh?” I asked although I had an idea what he was getting at with that question. “First this morning, and then you sit next to me in class using Ronna to strike up a conversation with me.” Davey said, showing me that no matter what had happened to him in this timeline, he was still as observant as ever, and as clever in figuring out why people were doing things. That was always one of his best gifts, being able to figure out people’s motivations with just a few words and some observations. “What kind of game are you playing with me? You’ve been in classes with me since the Seventh grade and have never shown this much interest in talking to me, not even when we played football together freshman year.” “I…” I wanted to tell him everything in that moment, but there was a little voice holding me back and it wasn’t just because we were in the middle of a crowded hallway with people all around us. “I’ve been thinking.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” He asked with a very familiar edge to his tone. Davey was getting angry. “It means I’ve kind of known you since seventh grade, except for when you were in Nevada, and I realized I really had never gotten to know you.” I started to explain in a wavering voice. His blue eyes were ice cold as he stared at me. “Why now?” Davey asked me angrily. “If you’re going to try to tell me it had nothing to do with that article, you’re crazy. I know you and your friends. You all love teasing people because of shit like that and if you think you can trick me…” “No!” I said vehemently, although my voice was barely more than a whisper. He must have seen how much I meant that because his head jerked back and he blinked. When he opened his eyes again, they were less angry, although he still had a wary look about him. “Then what?” He asked and I let out a long, slow breath. “I… when I saw that article, something inside me wondered what it would be like to be in your situation, with my family life spread out for everyone in the damn world to read.” I said quickly and as quietly as I dared to in the noise hallway. A guarded look filled his face now. “And?” He asked in a dangerous tone. “I kind of remembered that you were always a smart guy, and you seemed to be pretty cool when you were on the football team with us.” I said with a shrug. “You want to work together on the history project?” “Why would I want to work with you?” He said with a hint of sneer in his voice. That hurt, but I wasn’t going to show him how much it hurt. This was awful, I was standing here talking to the man I’d just spent some sixty-odd years living with as a husband, a partner, and now we were like strangers. No, we were strangers in more ways than one. I wanted my Davey, and it was only the look of love I’d seen in his eyes every night as I lifted him from his wheelchair and put him in our bed before crawling in and holding him tight that kept me from giving up at that moment. “Why are you here?” I asked and his eyes narrowed suddenly. “What do you mean?” Davey said as he switched from attack to defense. “Why are you here at Downey High?” I asked him, having remembered something very important. It had been at his mother’s graveside, and he was crying as he buried her yet again, but unlike other times he’d buried her, he was crying tears of joy and recollecting every time that she’d done something wonderful for him in all the timelines. There had been many things, and only a few about this, the original timeline, but there had been one very big thing she’d done for him, something he’d never really thanked her for until just before she had died in this timeline. “I…I live in the district…” He said defensively. “You know, in the articles it talks about your mother living in Ceres.” I said calmly, noting how his eyes widened. “Your sister, shouldn’t she be a freshman? Why isn’t she going to school here?” “That’s none of your business.” He said angrily and started to push past me, but I grabbed his arm and pulled him in close so I could whisper in his ear. “I think you came back because your friends from before are here.” I whispered quickly before he could pull away from my grasp on his arm. “You’re here because the people you went to elementary school, junior high, and freshman year are here. I heard your voice when you spoke about Nevada. You miss it a lot. Where did you go to school last year? You moved back here in November of 1984, but you didn’t come back to Downey until this school year. I bet you went to Ceres High, which is where your sister is going now.” “Shut up.” Davey whispered, but his tone was defeated and he didn’t bother trying to pull his arm out of my grip. His head was hanging down though, and I was willing to bet there were tears in his eyes. That made me feel bad, but it couldn’t be helped just yet. “What are you going to do?” “Why’d you come back here, to this school, Davey?” I asked him again, still just a whisper in his ear. “You know why.” He said and his shoulders heaved as he fought against a sob. “Tell me, please.” I almost begged. “I thought I had friends here.” He said bitterly. “Except for Ronna and Jeanette, though, there aren’t any here. While I played around at being somebody in Nevada, y’all moved on with your lives and I’m left in the fucking dust. There, you happy?” “No.” I said softly as I released his arm. He turned to look at me, and there were tears in his eyes, along with an angry glare that was fueled by confusion. “Then what?” He demanded in a low, angry voice. “You going to make me do your project for you like Ronna and Jeannette make me pay for their alcohol so they’ll hang around?” “No, we’re going to do this project together.” I told him with as mild an expression as I could put on my face. Oh, how I wanted to take him in my arms and wipe away those tears. “Let me tell you what I’ve been thinking. Your old man dragged you out to some backwater town in Nevada where he’d be a big preacher. I remember you in freshman football. As soon as your ankle healed from that bad tackle you were going to be back on the team and you had plenty of drive to get on second string, if not first. You had some friends, some decent friends here. Then you got dragged to bumfuck Nevada and had to start over.” “Are you a fucking mindreader?” Davey whispered with a look of shock replacing the anger on his face. “This town you lived in, was it big?” I asked and he shook his head. “Less than five hundred people in the entire fucking town, maybe as many people in the entire county as go to this school.” Davey answered. Yeah, that fit what I remembered of him telling me. “So you went from being another fish in the pond to being the big fish in the little pond, right?” I asked and he nodded his head after staring at me for a long moment. “Now you’re back to being just another fish in the pond and you don’t even know all the fish anymore because they’ve changed just like you have, and to make matters worse your father’s in all the papers and not in a good way.” “You are freaky.” He said in a whisper and I smiled. “Yeah, but I’m thinking I’d like to get to know you.” I said with that smile still on my face and I could see something melt in him before his shoulders slumped again. “Why?” He asked. “Sounds like you’ve figured out my pathetic life.” “Because as I was thinking about this, I realized if I was in that situation I’d want someone to be friends with who just might understand what I was going through.” I said calmly and he gave me a guarded look. “I also realized that while I may not understand everything you’re going through, I do understand some of it and maybe I should try and make friends with you. Lord knows anyone who’s been through shit like you have has got to be someone worth knowing. I’d be wanting to slit my wrists about now.” “Who says I haven’t?” Davey asked sarcastically and my heart nearly stopped at that thought, but then he’d lived long enough in this timeline to make it to 2004 alive. “So, we going to work on the project together?” I asked him and he nodded after a very long moment where I held my breath. “Good, I’ll see you in P.E., right?” I asked him. “Yeah, but I go to work right after.” He said softly. “Okay, see ya, Davey.” I said with a smile and walked off, not daring to look backwards. Had I said too much, or not enough? Only time would tell. Chapter 4 “You have to admit it looks pretty queer even if people don’t know what you said to us last week.” Trevor said in a way that totally set me off. “What the fuck did you tell her?” I yelled at him. We were in the middle of the nearly deserted parking lot. Both Trevor and Brandon were facing me, their body posture defensive. P.E. had ended long ago, and I’d just finished the afternoon’s NJROTC meeting only to find my two ‘friends’ waiting for me by my car. Davey hadn’t even waited for the end of P.E. before heading back into the gym and changing into his regular clothes. His car wasn’t in the parking lot when I came out, which I’d pretty much suspected since I’d stayed longer in the shower trying to calm down. It had been such a wonderful day from the moment I’d woken up this morning. Turning seventeen wasn’t supposed to be that big of a deal. Seventeen was the year between when you could get your driver’s license, and the year that you legally became an adult. There was just something about it though, at least for me this time around. Not many people could say they’d turned seventeen twice in a lifetime. My parents had even relented on my ‘birthday party’. It was just going to be a few friends, and of course my parents, but Davey would be there. He’d even asked for the night off of work, something he was really reticent to do, but he’d done it and that made me happy beyond belief. Davey had met me at the library after school twice now to work on our history project, and was starting to unwind a little around me. He’d been surprised when I asked him to come to my birthday party, protesting that he had to work. Money was tight for him, and he was working at three different McDonald’s restaurants in order to make his car payments, his insurance payments, and still have money for things like food and gas. His mother wasn’t working now because her back pain was so bad, and there were still the payments for his sister to go see a psychologist. The state had stopped paying for them, and his Nanny didn’t have the money for them since she was helping Davey’s mom by giving them a place to live, buying groceries, and helping to pay for the surgery Davey’s mom was going to have in a few weeks. Still, he was taking the night off so he could go to my birthday party. “Nothing about that stuff.” Brandon broke into the argument with his own angry look. “She’s just hurt, Brian, and she’s lashing out. Marcie thought you loved her and you just turned around and dumped her like that.” “Last week she said she dumped me.” I groused. “Yeah, well she’s a girl.” Brandon said with a sigh. “We’re not getting it any easier, you know. Our girlfriends are upset because she’s upset and they’re digging for why you won’t just apologize to Marcie so it’s all over. Add on that you’re now hanging around Davey and some of his freaky friends and everyone’s wondering. Reggie’s pissed at him because he’s a racist…” “He’s not a fucking racist.” I growled. “Reggie’s blowing things out of proportion just like Marcie is doing. How about his faggot comment in P.E.? That wasn’t exactly unbigoted, you know.” “Everyone hates queers, you know that.” Trevor said with a snort, earning a glare from me, but he didn’t say anything about my glare while Brandon looked off into the distance for a moment. “Look, it was you who said you were interested in Davey that way, and pretty soon people are going to figure it out. We don’t have to say anything. They’ll just assume you two are faggy on each other and go from there. You’re not acting at all like yourself, Brian, and you know that damn well.” “Well maybe I just fucking woke up and realized I wanted to be better than I’d been.” I snarled while resisting the urge to lash out at them. What made me really sick is that all these little popularity games in high school didn’t really end after graduation. They just changed, and grew more vicious. Kind of like the difference between playing poker with pennies and playing high stakes poker with a million dollars on the table. I’d lived in Washington D.C. for far too many decades to deny that the popularity games of high school were not reflective on the real world. “What the fuck was wrong with how you were before?” Brandon snorted. “I don’t know what’s going on in your head, Brian, but you better wake the fuck up. You’re doing that stupid Sea Scout thing, making friends with Jones and his freaky friends, and you’re totally ruining your reputation! Are you even going out for baseball this year?” “Of course I am.” I snarled. “Look, I just know I can be better than I’ve been lately.” “Don’t you remember what we promised each other back in seventh grade?” Trevor asked in a softer voice. “Yes, I remember.” I told him. “We decided we were going to be the baddest dudes in school and we’ve been that.” “Yeah, and now you’re fucking it up!” Trevor snarled. “Maybe I’m realizing there’s more than one way to be the best in our school.” I said angrily as I pushed past him and unlocked my car. “Brian.” Trevor said and then stopped as I got in the car and slammed the door. The engine started right up and I roared out of the parking lot, not caring if they got stung by loose gravel thrown up by my spinning tires. I was angry, as angry as I could ever remember being at my friends. Then again, they weren’t really my friends. I’d always known Davey had a positive affect on us in the last timeline, but this was just ridiculous. Brandon at least had always been more considerate of other people’s feelings while Trevor could be downright oblivious at times. Still, he’d never been so… arrogant before. I was relieved though when I pulled up in front of my house and saw Davey’s car out front. It was a Pontiac J2000; something I never even knew existed before. Still, there was no mistaking Davey’s car since the front-end was smashed up a bit. It wasn’t bad damage, just very noticeable. He’d had the accident just after midnight one weekend, having gotten off work late. He’d worked sixteen hours that day, he’d told me a couple days ago. Technically, it was a violation of the state’s child labor laws, but he got away with it because he’d only worked eight hour shifts at two different restaurants in town. That worried me, how he was working so much. It was taking away from his studies, and I knew now for a fact that most of the time he missed classes in school he was working because someone had gotten sick or quit and they’d called him to come in and work early. Then again, he was calling them every morning before he left for school to see if they needed the extra help. I parked my car behind his, leaving the driveway for my father and went inside the house. Davey hadn’t been over here before in this time line, but I knew my mother had been getting anxious to meet him so it was no surprise he was sitting in the dining room, having a soda while talking with my mother. “Brian, you’re home!” She said with a smile. “I found this young man here sitting out in his car waiting for you to get home, so I told him he had to come inside.” “Hi Mom, hi Davey.” I said with a smile while mom frowned. “Davey?” Mom asked. “Only Brian calls me that.” Davey said with a sigh. “Everyone else calls me David.” “Oh, I see.” Mom said with a curious little half-smile on her face. “Well, I’ll just let you two boys go do your thing while I finish getting things ready for Brian’s birthday party. Brian, did you know David’s birthday was last week? You boys are less than a week apart in age.” “Really?” I asked feigning surprise and wondering just how she’d managed to get that information out of Davey. I’d tried to get him to admit his birthday but he’d flat out told me it was none of my business. He was blushing now. “Yes, so now you’re going to have to go shopping with me so we can get him a nice present, even if it is after the fact.” Mom said before sailing out of the room. “You don’t have to do that.” Davey said softly. “Dude, forget the protests.” I said with a chuckle. “You’ve given Mom an excuse to go shopping and there’s no way in hell she’s going to give up a shopping trip just because you don’t want to be embarrassed.” “Oh.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “So…um…” “I’m sorry about P.E.” I said quickly and he shook his head. “Let’s not talk about that.” He said as he stood up. “I was wondering if you wanted to work on the history project. We’ve got the deadline for the outline coming up and I don’t want to drag your grade down by missing it.” “That sounds good.” I said. “Let me show you my room.” While we sat and debated different things for the history project, I couldn’t help but relax and feel like things were going better. Here, in my room where it was just the two of us, I could actually feel us growing closer. At school, Davey walked around with hunched shoulders, meekly flowing around the crowded hallways so he wouldn’t bump into people or bother them. If people wanted to talk or interact with him, they had to dig deep to get a reaction and it took a lot more effort than most high school students were willing to give. Yesterday, a guy whose first name I knew was Todd had stopped me in the hallway to say he’d seen Davey actually talking to me and how he thought that was ‘cool’. “I tried when he first showed up last semester, but it seemed like he always had something else he’d rather be doing.” Todd had said. “We were pretty cool in junior high, but he like totally disappeared freshman year.” The Davey I’d known in the previous timeline had decades of memories and experiences behind him and had been one of the most articulate and well-reasoned people I’d ever known. This Davey, the one sitting in my chair while I sat cross-legged on the edge of my bed, didn’t have those years of experience and memories to draw from. Despite that, while we talked about our history project, I was finding that he was just as articulate and well-reasoned. Sure, he wasn’t quite as able to pull up quotes and historical references, but he was the rough diamond that had become the well-polished diamond I’d known. A part of me wondered if that was how he’d seen me in all the different timelines as he’d gotten to know me again and again. “Boys.” Mom said as she knocked on my closed door. “Yes?” I called out and she opened the door just enough to stick her head inside. “Your dad called, Brian.” She said to me. “He’ll be home in about twenty minutes. We’ve got reservations for five o’clock at Marlucci’s so you boys should get ready. Davey, do you need to call anyone before you go to dinner with us?” “I…um…I can just go home.” Davey said hesitantly. “There’s no need for you to…” “Nonsense.” Mom said with a snort. “You’re coming to Brian’s party after, right?” “Yes.” Davey said slowly. “Good.” She stated with an emphatic nod of her head. “You’re here now and it makes no sense at all for you to go home only to come back later for the party. We made the reservations before Brian and Marcie broke up so you can just take her place.” “Thanks, mom.” I said while trying not to break out in laughter. Would she remember that line when Davey and I were finally a couple and came out to her? “Just remember you need to be wearing slacks and a nice shirt.” Mom said. “Oh.” Davey said a little crestfallen. “Don’t worry, we’re about the same size.” I said as Mom closed the door behind her. Sure, this Davey wasn’t nearly as in-shape as I was, and he had a bit of gut over his belt, but there should be something in my closet to fit him, and we spent the next ten minutes getting him into a pair of slacks that were a bit tight but still fit, and a dress shirt as well as a nice sweater. He was a little hesitant changing in front of me, and I frowned at the sight of the ragged underwear he had on, but we were dressed and ready to go by the time Dad arrived. Yes, I did notice the sly looks he gave me as I stripped down to my briefs before getting dressed. That was a good thing on all accounts, and I took extra time changing just so he would get a bit of a show. Yeah, I was going slowly with that aspect of our budding relationship, but there was no reason why I couldn’t show him what he’d get one day. Dinner was great, which wasn’t surprising since it was one of the best Italian restaurants in Modesto. Davey looked really uncomfortable at the start as we all perused the menus. He even tried ordering something relatively inexpensive, but I stepped in and talked him into ordering something a little higher up on the menu, something I knew he’d enjoy more. Dad and Mom both looked on with approval. As we all munched on mozzarella patties, my Dad started in on trying to draw Davey into conversation. He was subtle about it, first asking me questions about how school was going, how the NJROTC was going, and my plans for sports in the upcoming months. I’d played baseball every year since I was seven, except for skipping it last year, and he knew what I was planning on doing, but I knew he was getting me to talk first before he started asking Davey questions. “Well, what about you, David?” He asked Davey after I’d talked about my hopes that maybe this year Downey’s baseball team would win more games than we lost. “How is your semester going so far?” “It’s okay.” Davey said with a shrug as he quickly stuffed some cheese into his mouth and chewed while my father looked at him with a smile on his face. “Are you going to go out for any sports?” Dad asked him when he was done chewing. “Um, I can’t.” Davey said cautiously before taking a swallow of ice tea. “Oh, why not?” Dad asked him with a lift of his eyebrow. Like me, both my parents were blond but it was obvious I got my dark eyebrows from my father. “I have to work.” Davey said after a long pause and a glance at me. “Oh, that’s just too bad.” Mom said with a frown. “Young people should be able to enjoy their last few years of high school before they have to work.” “Yeah, well, my family needs the money.” Davey said with a shrug. “That’s right, Brian mentioned your mom was having major surgery in a few weeks.” Dad said and I hoped Davey wouldn’t get upset. He gave me a glance I couldn’t quite fathom, but he nodded at Dad’s statement. “Yes, they’re going to try to fix her back.” Davey said. “Nanny, that’s her mother, is paying for it so money’s really tight now.” “What’s wrong that they need to operate?” Mom asked. “Brian didn’t really give us too many details.” “Well, you see she’s had scoliosis since she was thirteen.” Davey said calmly. Apparently talking about his mother’s condition didn’t quite make him as uncomfortable as talking about his working. “They didn’t catch it until it was too late and after a really tough operation she ended up having a hump on her back. It means she gets tired easily and is always in a lot of pain. She also can’t breath that easily, so she gets winded pretty quickly. The surgery is supposed to help with that.” “What are they going to be doing?” Mom asked and Davey warmed up to the topic. “They’re going to break her ribs loose, reposition them and then reattach them to her sternum.” He answered, oblivious to the way Mom’s face went slightly white. “They’re also going to do something with her spine, help straighten it out some. She’ll still have that hump on her back, but it’ll be half the size it is now and she’ll have better lung capacity. The doctors say it should help her be able to work again. Right now she can’t stay on her feet more than a few hours without downing so many painkillers she goes loopy.” “Oh my, it sounds painful.” Mom said softly. “That’s what they say.” Davey agreed with her. “Mom’ll be in Children’s Hospital for at least a month while she recovers and then another four months recovering at home before she can expect to work again.” “Well, thank goodness for disability.” Dad said and Davey frowned. Dad saw it and reacted. “Don’t tell me they’re trying to not pay her disability.” “They’re saying it’s an elective surgery, not mandatory.” Davey answered. “Besides, we haven’t been back to California long enough for her to qualify since she’s only had one job and that was only for three months before the pain was too much for her.” “That’s just not right.” Mom said with a hint of anger in her voice. Davey looked surprised to hear that. “Don’t they understand she has a family to support?” “Yeah, well, we moved back in with my grandparents.” Davey said with a shrug. “It’s a little crowded with Shantill living there with her daughter, but Mom and Jenny share a room while Shantill sleeps in the middle bedroom. Nanny and Papa dote on her daughter, Whitney, and put her in the bed with them every night.” “Where do you sleep?” Mom asked, beating me to the question. “Papa converted the garage into a living room when they bought the house back in the sixties.” Davey answered. “So now you get it as your bedroom?” Dad asked with a smile. “Kind of.” Davey answered and I frowned. “My bed is behind the couch, and I’ve got a dresser I can use for my clothes, oh and I’ve managed to fit my stereo in next to the bed. As long as I wear headphones I can listen to it all I want, and Nanny and Papa usually go to bed after the 11 o’clock news so it’s not too bad. Plus, they make pretty good alarm clocks. They both get up around six in the morning and when they turn on the kitchen lights it’s even better than having an alarm clock. Papa put in these fluorescent lights over the dining table and when they turn them on in the morning they’re bright enough to wake me right up.” “I see.” Dad said slowly, and I could see the tightness around his eyes. This was… Davey had never mentioned this to me in our last lifetime. Maybe it was something he’d long forgotten, judging from the suddenly bitter expression on his face. The food arrived, saving him from further grilling by my parents for at least a few minutes.",

      "content": "“David, honey, did you say your mom was going to be at Children’s Hospital?” Mom asked after a few minutes. “Yes, in San Francisco.” Davey answered after he swallowed a bite of his food. “You’ll be going up to see her, of course.” Mom said. “Yes.” Davey answered although he frowned slightly. “I can’t miss much more school and Mom’s forbidden me from going up there during the week, but I plan on going up there all weekend long while she’s there. Nanny’s trying to find a hotel room she can afford so she’ll be up there all the time and Jenny gets to go for the day of Mom’s surgery and the day after. I wanted to go, but they’re saying I’ve missed too many days of school this year.” “Coach Cole said you’d be sent to alternative school if you missed more than one more day.” I said quickly, so my parents knew the score on that matter. Davey grimaced at me, but didn’t object. “Brian, would you object?” Dad asked and I knew right away what he was going to suggest. Without hesitating I shook my head. “Davey, has Brian told you about his apartment that he owns?” “You own an apartment?” Davey asked with surprise as he turned to look at me. “Yeah, it used to belong to my Uncle Rich.” I answered. “He left it to me when he died back in ’81.” “Oh.” Davey said with a weird look on his face. “It’s in San Francisco, and currently not occupied.” Dad said, drawing Davey’s attention back to him. “We’ve kept the furniture that was in it when Richard passed away and have rented it out to students and other people who don’t have a lot of their own furniture. Only thing is, right now there’s no one in there and the last few people who’ve applied we haven’t really liked. There’s no reason, if Brian agrees, that we couldn’t leave it vacant until your mother’s surgery and allow your grandmother to stay there, and of course you and your sister could stay there too when you go up to visit your mother on the weekends.” “That would be nice, but Nanny won’t just accept charity.” Davey said with a sigh. “Then we’ll charge her a fair rate.” Dad said with a smile. “If you want, you can tell her about it sometime this week and have her call Brenda to discuss the details.” “I’ll do that.” Davey said and paused for a moment before getting a look on his face that I knew was his ‘woops, forgot something’ look. “Um, thanks, all of you.” “You’re welcome.” Dad said with a smile and gave me a sharp look. “Brian, take notes from this guy. He sure knows how to be polite.” “Yeah, whatever.” I said with a typical teenage eye roll, although sometime soon he was going to get a big hug from me for being so generous. That seemed to end the subject of Davey’s family life for a bit, and not once had they brought up Davey’s father. While my parents began to tell the typical funny stories from my childhood, stories I blushed at like a typical teenager, I could see Davey relaxing. His shoulders weren’t hunched up anymore. He was sitting back in his chair, and a smile was on his face the entire time. I laughed as well, and listened with interest as the stories reached the point where I was older than twelve. From the stories they told after that point, it became clear that was where my life of this timeline diverted from the one I remembered. Meeting Davey along the bike path on the way to the first day of the seventh grade seemed to be the key difference. We skipped desert and headed back home, all four of us smiling as we left the restaurant. My parents seemed to genuinely like Davey, something that despite the last timeline I’d been a little nervous about. If things went well, and Davey once again ended up with me, there should be no problems with them accepting him as family. Dad already seemed protective of Davey in a way that I totally hadn’t expected. No one else had arrived by the time we got home, which wasn’t all that unexpected. We had another twenty minutes before the party was supposed to start. While Mom worked on the last little touches for the party, Dad gave Davey a tour of the house, including the old weight set in the garage. I could see the sparkle of interest in Davey’s eyes that he quickly suppressed. That encouraged me a bit, considering his current lack of physical fitness. He at least harbored a desire to work out again, and if he was given the chance, probably would. Trevor was the first to arrive, pulling up on his motorcycle. Brandon showed up not more than two minutes later, and the other three people I’d invited arrive moments later. Mom had been surprised by the modest number of people I’d invited. Apparently, last year I’d had nearly forty people over. Despite the fact that I’d told people to not bring gifts, Brandon had a small gift-wrapped package in his hands and everyone else had cards. Even Davey produced a card from somewhere. It was awkward for a few minutes as they all stood in the living room while my mom brought the cake into the dining room. Davey’s friend’s, Ronna (who was in our history class), Jeannette (the thin brown-haired girl whose braces had finally corrected her buck teeth), and the thin, red-haired boy Todd who I’d spoken to at school all stood behind Davey. Brandon and Trevor stood near me, looking at the three they didn’t really know. “Where are the girlfriends?” I asked my two friends. I’d invited their girlfriends out of politeness. “They wouldn’t come.” Trevor said sourly while looking over the two girls standing next to Davey, now talking to him quietly. “This is from Marcie.” Brandon said as he tried to hand the package over to me. I flushed with anger at that. “Take it back to her.” I said. “No, I’m not playing gofer for you two.” Brandon snarled as he threw the package down onto the couch. “You give it back to her tomorrow at school.” “Fine.” I said with a sigh as I scooped up the package and put it on the fireplace mantle. I turned to Davey’s friends then, giving up on Brandon and Trevor for the moment. “Thanks for coming.” “Thanks for inviting us.” Jeannette said with a smile that caused me to worry for a moment. “How about all of you come in the dining room?” Mom called out. “The cake’s ready.” What followed was a very uncomfortable forty minutes as they sang happy birthday to me and I blew out the candles before Dad cut the cake. My parents really saved the night by asking all sorts questions of the three people they didn’t know, and dragging both Brandon and Trevor into the discussion at different points. I was actually relieved to see Brandon and Trevor leave early. Certainly the explanations of how Ronna, Davey, Jeannette, and Todd all knew each other was a lot freer and more enjoyable. Todd had some funny stories of Davey in an eighth grade math class they’d shared. I’d never heard the story of crazy Mrs. Dent, her good guy/bad guy explanation of multiplying negative numbers, nor the funny story about sticks of Big Red gum being exchanged behind her back. Considering Todd’s red hair, I had to wonder if he’d been making passes at Davey all that time or if they’d actually done something together. That made me slightly jealous, and I debated on whether I should have invited him or not, but realized there was nothing I could do about it if something had happened. It was just as much my fault as it would be Davey’s. We had still bumped into each other, according to Ronna’s story about the first time she ever saw me, but there had been no conversation. In my timeline, I’d actually bumped into Sean, but Davey told me that the first time it had been him I’d bumped into. Still, in this time, we’d never chatted, never became friends. I’d apparently walked off without a word except for my angry exclamation at him that he’d ignored. It was almost funny how one little thing could cause such a big difference. “If you kids would like to go out and ditch the old folks, we wouldn’t mind.” Mom said after another twenty minutes had passed. That surprised me since I was supposedly still grounded, but Dad nodded his agreement. “Just be back by midnight, son.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. They’d given me some nice gifts, new clothes and a new watch that was pretty cool. “I know just the place to go.” Ronna said with a smile as we headed out of the house. “I’ll drive.” I offered and everyone agreed. Davey sat in front while the other three piled into the back of my Mustang. Following Ronna’s directions we ended up at a deserted park near the river. After I parked the car, we all piled out and Ronna led us to some bench tables that were actually near the water. Jeannette was carrying a backpack she’d come into the house with and she produced two thermos bottles as we sat down. “What did you bring?” Davey asked with far too much excitement in his voice for my comfort. I wasn’t born yesterday, and put teenagers, dark location near a river, and thermos bottles together and I came up with some kind of alcohol. “Screwdrivers, just the way you like it, Davey dear.” Ronna said with a smile. “Cool.” Todd said with a smile. Davey was sitting next to Ronna with Jeannette on the other side and Todd was next to me on the other side of the table. Jeannette handed one thermos to me and the other to Davey. “Drink up birthday boy.” Jeannette said with a dazzling smile. “Uh, I’m driving, I shouldn’t drink.” I said softly. “Oh, c’mon, at least one sip.” Ronna said and I shrugged. One sip wouldn’t hurt. “Oh god.” I said moments later as I coughed. The shit was strong, too damn strong! “Like a touch of orange juice with your vodka, do you?” “Blame Davey.” Ronna said with a laugh as Davey handed her the thermos while I handed mine to Todd. He took a deep gulp, shook his head after swallowing the awfully strong drink and handed the thermos over to Jeannette who took a deep swig. “So what do we do now?” Todd asked. There was just enough light from the moon to see that his eyes were already starting to get glassy. Damn that shit was strong! “It’s a birthday party.” Ronna said with a smile. “How about Truth or Dare?” “Oh god, not that again.” Davey groaned after his fourth swallow of the foul concoction. “What? We haven’t done that in years!” Ronna protested with a laugh. “Yeah, last time you ended up daring me to kiss Mardi McFarland and she followed me around all eighth grade like she was convinced I was going to marry her.” Davey groaned. “She still would if you asked her out again.” Jeannette jibed with a laugh. She pulled out a silver pin and put it in the middle of the table. “Okay, here’s a pen we can use since both the thermoses are still full.” “Um, aren’t we a little old for this?” I asked, not totally sure I wanted to be doing this, especially at the rate they were drinking. Todd was halfway drunk already, and Davey looked like he had a good buzz going after his fifth drink from a thermos. “Oh, these are not going to last long at all.” Ronna said with a frown at her thermos. “You sure you don’t want more, birthday boy?” “That’s fine.” I said with a frown. “Good.” Ronna replied, taking another sip while reaching out and spinning the pen. The pointy end stopped facing me and I suppressed a groan while Ronna giggled. “Truth or dare, Brian?” “Truth.” I said, not wanting to be dared to run around the park naked, which I was sure she would have done given the look in her eyes. “Oh you’re no fun.” She moaned. “So, who really broke up with who, you or Marcie?” “She dumped me, but I wanted her to.” I answered sourly and all four of them laughed. “Your turn.” Ronna said with glee and I spun the pen. It landed on Todd. “Truth or Dare?” I asked him with resignation. He actually seemed to think about it for a moment before mumbling ‘truth’ to me. I was feeling a bit pissed and my mouth shot off before I thought about what I was asking. “So do you like Big Red ‘cause it lets you make a joke about your cock?” “Um, um, yeah.” Todd said as his face blushed a bright red and the other three at the table burst out in laughter. Davey almost fell backwards from his laughing and Todd glared at me before spinning the pin. As fate would have it, it landed on Jeannette who demanded a dare. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” Todd said immediately with a triumphant gleam in his eyes as he looked at me before taking the thermos from Davey. Jeannette squealed in happiness and leaned over the table towards me. She got her kiss, and it was a decent one on my part, although she slobbered way too much. It was nothing like kissing my Davey, who was currently sniggering at me. Jeannette’s spin landed on Ronna, and Ronna was dared to kiss me. She was definitely better than Jeannette, and quite good at using her tongue, but again she wasn’t Davey. “Dare.” Todd said with a wicked smile when Ronna’s spin landed on him. Ronna’s answering smile spelled trouble and she proved it immediately. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” She said in a wicked tone. Ronna and Davey burst out in laughter, leaning against each other while Todd looked stricken. He gulped and looked at me hesitantly while I let out a groan. “Oh come on, it’s just a game!” Ronna nearly shouted amidst her laughter. “Am I going to have to kiss everyone at this table?” I growled, setting off a fresh round of laughter. I was irritated at the childish game, but I grabbed Todd’s head with both hands and brought him in for a kiss, tongue and all. After a surprised moment, he returned the kiss, to my surprise, and he was better than either of the girls had been. I broke the kiss when I started to harden. The slacks I was wearing wouldn’t hide an erection for long. “Oh, that was priceless!” Jeannette giggled. “I wish I had a camera!” “Spin.” I growled at Todd who was licking his lips and looking at me in a way that made me uncomfortable. Had he enjoyed the kiss? His spin landed on Davey, and Davey let out a groan. “Don’t tell me, you dare me to kiss Brian.” Davey said with what I was hoping was just mock horror. Todd squeaked out a ‘you bet’ and Davey looked at me expectantly. We both leaned across the table, and my body tingled as our lips touched for the first time in this reality. Despite the smell of vodka and orange juice on his breath, it was a wonderful moment as our lips touched and our tongues sought each other’s mouth. It ended all too soon, and I sat down in a hurry when I realized I was now fully erect. “Oh god, that was just too fucking hot.” Jeannette murmured while Ronna shot me a look that could only be described as jealousy. Davey was hunched over in that now-familiar gesture that something had embarrassed him. If he was as hard as I was, which I hoped, then I could understand his posture. He took a very long gulp from a thermos before spinning the pen, which landed on Jeannette, who was now looking thoughtful. “Truth.” She said, changing the tempo of the game. At that moment I was very thankful for that. “Have you ever gone all the way with a guy?” Davey asked her and she blushed. “Yes.” She answered and quickly spun the pen again. It landed on Ronna and Jeannette smiled quickly when Ronna took a dare. “Ronna, I dare you to go for a walk with Davey for at least ten minutes.” “That’s easy.” Ronna said as she got to her feet, only slightly unsteady, and pulled Davey up before taking his arm and walking off towards some trees. “Oh thank God.” Jeannette said as she swallowed some more alcohol. “That was the whole purpose of that game. Sorry you had to kiss two guys on your birthday, Brian.” “Don’t worry.” I said with a shrug. “What do you mean that was the whole purpose?” “Oh, it’s just that Ronna’s been interested in Davey for years and she’s finally gotten the nerve up to tell him.” Jeannette said. She was slurring her words slightly, and Todd was taking another long pull from the other thermos. “She’s going to tell him she likes him and ask him to go out with her. I think she’s hoping to get some action while she’s out there, too.” “Oh.” I said with shock, not sure how to react. Yeah, Davey was gay, but he could still choose to date her and pretend. It wasn’t like he was out or anything. Only a hand on my thigh broke that jealous thought and suddenly I was faced with another problem. The hand could only be Todd’s, and when I didn’t react immediately, his hand slid further up my thigh until it was cupped over my erection. Jeannette had turned her back to us and was watching the river that glinted with reflected moonlight. It was all to surreal for me, as Todd squeezed my erection and I sideways glance revealed a smile on his face. His red hair was longish, and curled around the edges of his pale neck in a way that was suddenly very attractive. Part of me knew it was my seventeen-year old hormones talking, but with Davey off in the trees with a girl he’d known for years and years, and showing no real interest in me beyond friendship, it was almost tempting. Almost, but not quite. I reached down with my hand and gently pulled his off of my crotch. He frowned, and started to look worried, but the soft smile on my face, a squeeze of his hand and a wink put him at ease as I placed his hand on his own leg instead of mine. He let out a sigh as I turned to ask Jeannette a question. The rustling of trees in the distance interrupted me, though, and Davey stomped back over to the table, an angry look on his face. Ronna followed a few seconds later, looking both angry and hurt while Jeannette started to mutter a few curses. There was a tense moment at the table until Davey spoke. “We have school in the morning.” He said in a tight voice. “Brian, you mind dropping us off?” “Sure.” I said flatly, wanting to ask what exactly had happened, but I was also relieved that I knew at least one thing. Davey had not reacted well to whatever Ronna said. It was weird dropping the girls off because Jeannette lived so near the house that I’d always thought of as being Davey’s home. It was empty in this timeline, and my eyes misted over at the thought of all that I had lost from the last timeline. Then again, I’d been an old man there, and my days with Davey Jones had been coming to an end. In a few years we’d both have been dead, and now there was the possibility of another lifetime with him, no matter the troubles that we faced now. “Todd’s house is just a few blocks away.” Davey said and gave me directions. When I pulled up in front of it, he got out with Todd. “Happy birthday, Brian.” Todd said softly. “I had a good time.” “Thanks Todd.” I replied with a genuine smile. “I was glad you could be there.” “Thanks again, Brian.” Davey said as he shut the door and leaned in from the outside. That confused me. I’d planned to have him stay the night since he couldn’t drive with as much alcohol as he’d consumed. “We can get a ride with Todd’s mother in the morning. Would you mind giving me a lift back to your house in the afternoon so I can pick up my car?” “Uh, sure.” I said softly and he smiled before turning to follow Todd in the house. They were inside the nice home for several minutes before I pulled away from the curb. The memory of Todd’s hand on my erection was all too recent and played a major role in my dark thoughts of what would be happening in that house tonight. I knew Davey had no problem with sleeping around in this timeline, and I knew Todd at least played for our team a little bit, and that combination had me imagining the familiar body of Davey’s locked in wild passionate sex with the cute red-head instead of with me, the way he should have been. By the time I got home and inside, the tears in my eyes were more than enough to obscure my vision. Fortunately the parents were in bed, so I could escape to the safety of my bedroom, throw myself down onto my bed and cry myself to sleep over should-have-beens. Chapter 5 “Hey.” I greeted Davey as he sat down in history class.He just mumbled a response, and I was torn between my jealous feelings and sympathy. His eyes were bloodshot, and he was wearing the clothes I’d loaned him for dinner last night.Ronna shuffled in a few moments later, also with bloodshot eyes I noticed as she glared at Davey before sitting on the other side of the room. Davey didn’t even notice her glare, as he was hunched over his desk and fiddling with a notebook. “You doing okay?” I asked Davey quietly after we’d sat there in silence. “Just hung over.” He mumbled. “We didn’t ruin your birthday, did we?” “No.” I lied. “Good.” He replied as the bell rang and Mr. Wansor began the class.He looked disappointed that today there was very little discussion despite his best efforts. I, for one, didn’t feel like adding anything of my own because I was still seething over last night, and Davey going to Todd’s instead of coming home with me. Part of me wanted to be fair, I hadn’t invited Davey to spend the night, but still, him and Todd being together had me riled up. I ate lunch alone that day, being unable to find Davey.Brandon and Trevor left campus with their girlfriends and Marcie, who was now hanging off the arm of Jim McDonald, another player on the football team. Ronna and Jeannette ignored me in the cafeteria, and Todd was sitting with a bunch of friends.So far, my efforts to find out what had happened to Sean were having no results at all. Only a few of those I spoke to barely remembered him at all.It was almost like he’d disappeared off the face of the earth. P.E. got off to a bad start before I’d even changed into my workout gear.Today was a weight-training day, and I was looking forward to it a lot. Working out with weights had always been a stress reliever for me, and the state of my weight equipment in the garage at home told me that I’d gotten out of the habit of using it in the last year. “Yo, Breckenridge.” Reggie’s voice rang out in the locker room.It was a big room, but all of the football team had lockers near each other and Reggie’s was a few feet down from mine.He’d called out just as I was putting my jock strap on. “What?” I practically snarled and he grinned so that his white teeth shone like beacons in his dark face. “I hear Marcie wasn’t happy because you couldn’t satisfy her with your stump of a dick.” He teased, garnering laughs from those nearby.Brandon was sniggering along with the rest of them while Trevor limited himself to a snarky grin. “Man, you should know better than to listen to that bitch’s lies.” I snorted as my mind raced for a comeback. I was just too pissed off by now to be nice. “That cunt was so damn wide open she could fit the entire football team in there at once without feeling a damn thing.” “No shit.” Reggie said with a salacious grin while several people laughed openly at that comment. “Hell, I thought you knew that.” I continued, emboldened by the fact that people were now laughing with me and not at me. “I heard she could never learn to keep her damn legs shut.That’s why I had to dump her, you know.There’s no telling what’s been in her cunt, and I don’t want to catch some nasty disease from her skanky ass.” “Oh man, she’s not going to like that.” Brandon murmured from nearby as everyone laughed. “Who cares?” I responded back angrily as I pulled on some sweat pants.Davey was doing well, not having missed any classes this week, but he milled around as everyone filed into the weight room.Something in me snapped at that point, and I realized that my jealousy was being irrational.My Davey had explained something about himself at this age, in this timeline, and I had to remember that. It was the reason why I hadn’t tripped him into my bed already.The Davey of this timeline pushed away everyone he just had sex with, and I’d seen that when he just blew by Todd in the hallway this morning.If I wanted to not only get Davey into my bed, but keep him there forever, I had to make sure we were close friends first, and make sure that when he did find his way into my bed, that we’d talked about it beforehand, and that he’d opened his mind to being gay and accepted that a relationship between two men was possible.Right now, he believed being gay was a sickness, something to be hidden, and that it was impossible for two men to have a relationship. “You ready for some weights, buddy?” I asked as I came up to Davey and slipped my arm around his shoulder. He stiffened at the touch, but nodded hesitantly before allowing me to lead him into the weight room.What followed was probably the best part of the day, with me taking the time to show him how to correctly use the weight machines. I made sure to talk softly, so it wouldn’t be obvious that he didn’t really know what he was doing, and we spent most of the entire hour in a semi-comfortable almost-silence.We didn’t talk about anything other than our working out, but it seemed to heal the rift that had been between us earlier in the day. On my part, there was just something about being in his presence that soothed me.Even if we weren’t sharing the deepest secrets of our hearts, or for that matter even talking about the weather, at least I was in the room with him and we were interacting.Nor did I miss the way he stared at my crotch as I spotted him on the bench press. He was wearing an old, ragged pair of gray sweats that showed me enough of his reaction that I had to smile for the rest of the class period. No, neither of us was fully hard, but there was some excitement there.Fortunately, no one else was paying much attention to us as we finished our workout and headed into the locker room for showers.As we passed Coach Cole, I noticed the approving nod he gave me, and the very tight smile on his face. “Thanks.” Davey said twenty minutes later as he got out of my car.We were at my place, and he was heading for his car before I’d even turned off the ignition of the mustang. “Hey, you want to come inside?” I asked him and he shook his head. “I’ve got to run by all three restaurants and pick up my paychecks, sign them and get them to Nanny before I change and go to work at the McHenry Avenue one.” Davey said quickly.“Thanks though, I’ll see you in school, tomorrow, right?” “Yep.” I assured him and he smiled again before getting into his car.I stood there and waved as he drove off, not sure if I should have done something to keep him around longer.Damn it all, this was so damn frustrating! How had he done this, navigated the course of what to allow to happen, when to interfere, and all that crap?As unprepared as he was that first time Davey went back in time, he was better prepared in many ways than I was now. He knew the timeline he was changing, I did not. David Jones Sr. was supposed to be on track for becoming President of the United States. Instead he was a convicted child molester who couldn’t get elected as a dogcatcher at this point.Brandon and Trevor were supposed to be our best friends, and instead they frowned about the time I spent with Davey and stayed with girlfriends neither of them really cared about.As for Sean, subtle inquiries by me had not produced even a cold trail. I’d even looked in the phone book for his family and found nothing. He’d told me not to bother looking him up, but he was a friend, or at least he had been a friend in the other timeline. “Brian, honey, you okay?” Mom’s voice from the doorway reminded me I was standing on the edge of our driveway, staring at the spot where Davey’s car had been. “Sorry, just thinking.” I said as I walked up the driveway and gave her a hug.That was one good thing about this timeline; I could still hug my parents. “How was school today?” She asked as she followed me inside the house. “Frustrating.” I answered honestly and got a weird look from her. “That’s a new answer.” She said with a slight smile. “What was so frustrating?” “Just about everything.” I answered honestly, knowing it was a cryptic response and not sure how much could be shared with her without setting off alarm bells.She took that in stride though. “Would you like something to snack on?” She asked. “No thanks, I’ve got to get started on homework.” I replied. “Okay, just let me know.” She said. “I’m working with the foundation on our next fundraiser, so I’ll be in the office.” “Okay.” I replied, not sure exactly what she was talking about.This was part of my problem. As familiar as things were, I still felt like I was living in someone else’s life at times. This wasn’t the past I remembered, and I missed what I remembered.Everything was just too different! The homework was too easy, I realized about an hour later.With a sigh, I put the last of it away and changed into a pair of sweats and a white t-shirt. Maybe I could use the weight set in the garage and work off some of the tension I was feeling. Ten minutes later, as I looked at my weight set, I let out a long sigh.From what I was seeing, it hadn’t been used in at least a year. That gave me a useful task after I opened the garage door for more light and some fresh air.The first job was to get all the dust off the equipment and check to make sure everything was still in useable condition. Twenty minutes later, I was relieved that nothing was irreparably damaged.That was when the sound of a Volkswagen Beetle reached the garage, and a minute later a semi-decrepit 1970’s era lime-green Beetle pulled up in front of the house. A pair of fuzzy dice were even visible hanging from the rear view mirror, and as Todd got out, I found I was smiling. “Hi.” Todd said as he walked up the driveway. He looked a little uncomfortable, as if he wasn’t sure of the reception he’d get, but he did have a half-smile on his face. “Heya Todd.” I replied while being sure to smile. The red-haired guy returned the smile and seemed to relax just a bit.“You look pretty good compared to Davey and Ronna.” “I went home and took a nap after school.” He replied with a slightly wider smile. “So what brings you here?” I asked as I stood up from dusting off a set of fifty-pound weights. “I, uh, I was just in the area.” Todd said with a shrug and an uncomfortable look that said otherwise. “Did you enjoy your birthday?” “It was nice.” I said noncommittally. He put his hands in his jean pockets and lowered his head a bit, looking at me through his reddish bangs. “I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable last night.” He said in a breathy voice, with the words tumbling out one after the other. “I swear I don’t know what happened. All that alcohol and those stupid dares…” “Don’t sweat it.” I said with a shrug. What followed was one of those uncomfortable silences that happen from time to time. From the way Todd kept looking around, and returning to me over and over again, I knew he wanted to say something more about the previous night, but he was scared. “I, um, uh, about last night, you know, um, you won’t say anything, right?” Todd managed to stammer out and I almost laughed, but quickly suppressed the smile that was starting to form on my face. “Like I’m going to tell people I kissed you and Davey?” I said with a snort and he seemed to relax slightly. “Sorry, I was just, um, well you know.” Todd said with a shrug as he blushed. “Know what?” I asked with real curiosity. “I mean, I’m not going to end up stuffed in a garbage can or anything, right?” Todd said in a rush. “When was the last time I’ve done that?” I asked rhetorically, but an old memory surfaced, and I could feel the blood draining from my face. “Well, do you remember Sean in freshman year?” Todd said with a little bit of fire appearing in his voice.It disappeared quickly as he looked at me with a little bit of fear and I started to feel ashamed. I wasn’t the Brian that had done that.In my own time, someone like Todd would never have been afraid of me, but this wasn’t my timeline was it? Still, the mention of Sean, and the hint of familiarity in his voice gave me a bit of hope. “I remember him.” I said with a frown, pulling up that memory of a conversation between Sean and Davey that we had witnessed. I hadn’t thought about it for decades, but it was crystal clear in my mind’s eye now. “He…” “You guys were kind of mean to him.” Todd finished when I paused.He looked at me sideways, as if afraid of my reaction. “Yeah, we were and he didn’t deserve it at all.” I said softly and could see the surprise on Todd’s face.“I haven’t seen him around in ages.” “He… his folks moved.” Todd said quickly, covering up at least a bit of Sean’s story, which he obviously knew. “I almost wish I could see him again to apologize.” I said, casting out a line and hoping he’d bite. “Why?” Todd asked and I smiled at him, hoping to reassure him. “He didn’t deserve what we did to him.” I said softly.“I’m sure given half a chance he’d make a good friend.” “I’ve known him since sixth grade.” Todd said softly.“We’re actually related distantly. His father’s cousin married one of my mom’s cousin or something like that.I heard he was somewhere in Southern California.” “Really?” I said with surprise. “Does he ever come back to town?” “Once in a while.” Todd said with a shrug. “You know, it’d be nice to say ‘sorry’ to him.” I said and Todd gave me an odd look. “I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but you’ve like changed a lot since school let out last winter.” Todd said in a rush again. “Yeah, I grew up, I guess.” I said with a shrug. It had the virtue of being true, in a way. “Wow.” Todd said softly. “I guess people can change.Don’t get me wrong, you’ve always seemed like you could be a nice guy, but you never gave yourself a chance, you know.” “Yeah, that sounds about right.” I agreed and his eyes widened a bit.My smile seemed to reassure him though. “So, Davey got his car?” He said to change the subject before it got more uncomfortable. “Yeah, he had to leave in a hurry though.” I said with regret, which he seemed to hear in my voice. “He’s a lot different than he was when I knew him before.” Todd said and I raised an eyebrow as an unspoken question. “I met him in eighth grade.We had the same math class, old crazy Mrs. Dent.Freshman year we still talked because we had the same math class, but he was busy hanging around the football team after school so we didn’t get together as much. Then he just flat disappeared.I heard from somewhere that he’d moved to Nevada.” “Yeah.” I said after he’d fallen silent. “You know about his dad?” Todd asked and I nodded. “Fucking sick.” “Yeah.” I agreed softly. “So he came back here after that.” “He doesn’t talk about it much.” Todd said. “Ronna’s gotten some of the story from him, but when the subject comes up, he clams up tight.” “She’s known him a long time?” I asked and Todd nodded. “They’ve known each other since the fourth grade.” Todd explained.“I guess you could say she’s known him longer than anyone else except his family. Last night, she wanted to ask him out, but he shot her down.She’s kind of mad at him.” “I can see that.” I said, hoping he’d share what he knew. “He told her that when they first moved back, he didn’t know what was going on with his dad.” Todd said sadly.“His mom just told him they were coming back to California for Thanksgiving.He missed most of that semester and had to make up work the next year at Ceres High. Ronna said he begged for a transfer to Downey and his mom worked it out somehow. Ronna thought he wanted it to try to find her again. She’s got this notion that she and Davey are meant to be together.” “Not fucking likely.” I snorted and he actually chuckled for a moment before giving me an appraising look. “You and I probably have a better chance at that.” He said very softly, barely above a whisper and this time I gave him a deep, searching look.Did he want my Davey? “Well he is a good kisser.” I said softly and Todd frowned. “Better than me?” Todd asked as if he was offended and we both burst out in laughter. “Do you really want an answer to that?” I asked him when we’d calmed down. “No, not really.” Todd said quietly, looking nervous again.“Does that freak you out?” “What, kissing guys?” I asked and he nodded. “Not really.” “Oh.” Todd said with a look of surprise. “Does that mean…are you?” “Am I what?” I asked him and he shuffled his feet nervously while hanging his head and looking at me through his red bangs. “Um…you know.” He said softly after I remained silent. “I guess you could describe me as being bi.” I said softly, knowing that twenty years from now such an admission might not have been as big a deal as it was in the here and now. Todd’s head jerked up and he looked at me with surprise as his mouth formed a small “O”. “Is that why you broke up with Marcie?” He asked. “Let’s just say I realized she wasn’t what I was looking for in life.” I answered his question with a shrug. “Rad.” He said softly. “I never thought someone like you would ever admit to liking guys like…” “Like?” I asked him and he hung his head again. “I don’t like girls.” He said very softly with blushing cheeks. “Nothing wrong with that.” I said casually and his head jerked again. This was almost fun. “I’ve never talked with anyone…” Todd said softly before swallowing nervously. “Most guys our age wouldn’t want to talk about it at all.” I said and he nodded. “Davey freaks if I even hint about stuff like this.” Todd said and I felt a surge of jealousy.He had done it with Davey! “Really?” I managed in a voice that barely shook at all.At the moment, I was very proud of that fact.Knowing Davey didn’t have the same…values that I did in this timeline was one thing, but being confronted with it was an entirely different animal. “Not that we’ve ever done anything.” Todd said quickly, noting something in the glare I was giving him without thinking about what I was doing.“Whenever he sleeps over, I’ve got an extra twin bed in my room. It use to be my brother’s before he went off to college. Still, I’ve seen the way he looks at me sometimes at night, and well, I’ve seen the way he’s looked at you this last week at school.” “The way he looks at me?” I asked with surprise, and a sudden warm feeling filled my heart.He was looking at me! “I don’t mean to upset you.” Todd said softly, mistaking the flushing of my cheeks. “I’m not upset.” I said quickly. “You like him, don’t you?” Todd asked. “Yes.” I answered simply and he smiled. “That’s like, so cool.” Todd said. “I can’t believe we’re standing here discussing it like this.I never thought…” “Life’s full of surprises.” I said with a dismissive shrug. “Dude, you know he’s pretty messed up right now, don’t you?” Todd asked.“He works a lot, and his home life ain’t too good either.Like I said, he don’t talk about it much, but we’ve figured out some of it between us.Sometimes he fights with his grandfather and shows up at my place late at night when my parents aren’t home – they go a lot during the week on business, and so he sneaks in and spends the night after he fights with his grandfather. The old man locks him out if he isn’t home by eleven, and sometimes Davey works until late at night.” “That sucks.” I said simply, not sure why Pete would do such a thing.In my timeline, him and Davey had been tight as thieves.Thanks to Sean’s medical equipment, the old man hadn’t suffered the ravages of Alzheimer’s like he had in other timelines, according to Davey. Every year they took an annual fishing trip to a lake somewhere nearby, all the way up until the old man had died in 2017, just a month after his hundredth birthday. Davey had taken him, just the two of them, fishing on Pete’s birthday, which was a week before Davey’s own birthday. This timeline sucks; I reminded myself, amazed yet again how Davey had persevered through all this and became the man I loved. “It does suck.” Todd agreed softly with my last verbal statement.“You know, Davey’s a good guy.A really good guy. He’d give the shirt off his back if you needed it, but he doesn’t like to take help, and he never asks for it either.I had to beg him to come over if he gets locked out.Jeannette caught him sleeping in his car one night and got him to admit he couldn’t go home because he was locked out.He got pissed as hell that she told Ronna, and he was pissed that Ronna told me. Their parents don’t like him much, mostly ‘cause of his father.” “It was good of you to make sure he knew he could stay with you.” I said softly and Todd smiled in appreciation of the compliment. “Yeah, well, nights when my parents get home, he can’t stay and I know he sleeps in his car then.” Todd said with a frown. “I wish I could help him more, but he wouldn’t take it if I offered.My parents, well if they knew, they wouldn’t let him stay over during the week.” “He can always stay here, you know.” I said firmly. “What about your parents?” Todd asked. “They seem to like him, and they won’t turn him away.” I said.“Although they might have some sharp words with his grandfather.” “Then he’d never risk them finding out again.” Todd shook his head. “Just… if he can’t stay at your place and is locked out, tell him to come here.” I told Todd. “I’ll make sure my parents don’t do anything to scare him off.” “You sure?” Todd asked as his watch alarm started beeping.“Shit.I have to be at work in twenty minutes.” “I’m sure, don’t worry.” I said and stood up to hold out my hand.He looked at it and smiled before shaking it. “See ya tomorrow.” He said brightly before turning and rushing to his beetle before taking off. “Who was that?” Mom asked as I stood there thinking about Davey and his problems. “A new friend.” I answered her after a pause. “Really?” Mom sounded surprised. “I don’t think you’ve made a new friend in years.” “He was here last night.” I reminded her. “His name’s Todd.” “Oh that’s right, the boy with red hair.” She said. “Are you hungry?” “I could use a snack.” I agreed, reminded yet again that my teenage body needed more food than I was use to consuming as an old man. “Is everything going alright, Brian?” Mom asked as she put down a plate of sliced cheese and fruit on the kitchen table. She also had two glasses of water, and sat down across from me as I picked up a piece of cheese. The boys had shared my love of cheese, to Davey’s horror.Even after three lifetimes, he still couldn’t stand to eat any yellow cheese like this. “Things are okay, why?” I asked with a slight frown after swallowing the sharp cheddar cheese. “Well, it’s just…you’ve been a little different lately.” Mom said softly.“Don’t get me wrong, your father and I are really happy with some of the changes, especially after that night, but we’re also a little worried.” “What are you worried about?” I asked while furrowing my eyebrows.How had Davey managed to make it through situations like this?It was so different after being an adult to have to answer to my parents again. Sure, even after Davey and I had gone off to Stanford, they’d still been my parents, but as time went by we became adult friends as well as parents and child. Now I was back to being their child again, although bordering on adulthood.To make it even more interesting I could remember what it had been like to be a parent of two seventeen-year old boys and all the heartache they put Davey and I through with their schooling, their girlfriends, and their interesting group of friends. Certainly the media had a field day with them a time or two, but at least Davey’s father had already left the Oval Office by that point so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. “I haven’t seen Trevor or Brandon over here in a while except for your birthday.” Mom said with a slight frown on her face. “The three of you have been all but inseparable since junior high.What’s going on?” “We’re having a difference of opinion.” I said sourly. “About what?” Mom asked as she nibbled on a piece of melon. “It’s over my breaking up with Marcie.” I told her and she chewed for a moment before replying. “High school can be a difficult time, Brian.” Mom said in a nice tone.“We often think we’re in love with someone and we find out we’re not. At least you broke up with her before things got too serious, right?” “Yeah.” I answered the unspoken question as well as the one that she voiced, and prayed I was right. The last thing on earth that I needed was for the ‘me’ of this timeline to have gotten that fucking bitch pregnant. “So what’s the problem with Trevor and Brandon?” Mom asked. “They don’t really understand why I don’t want to get back together with Marcie, and their girlfriends were giving them a bad time about pushing me to get back together with her.” I said in a rush and Mom shook her head. “So they’re being torn between their friendship with you and their girlfriends?” Mom asked, but in a tone that made the question rhetorical. “Kids these days.” I said with a chuckle, and worried I might have slipped a little, but she laughed and smiled at the statement. “I wouldn’t worry too much about them, Brian.” Mom assured me.“Give it some time to calm down and they’ll remember the years of friendship they’ve had with you.” “That’s what I’m thinking.” I agreed. “You know, sometimes I forget that you really are almost grown now.” She said with a fond smile that I remembered all too dearly. I’d missed her since she died, a great-grandmother as well as a grandmother and a mother. The last Christmas she’d been alive, we’d had six little kids running around the house, as well as our own two sons and their wives. “Yeah, life goes by too fast sometimes.” I agreed with her, lost in the memory of a timeline gone forever now. “Well, I’ve got homework to do, thanks for the snack.” “You’re welcome.” Mom said as I stood up and went to my room.The homework didn’t take all that long, and when I was finished, I began rummaging through the top drawers of my desk in what was becoming a regular routine. This life was similar to my original teenage years, but there was just enough difference to it that I was trying to piece together the clues of what those differences were. Stuck in the back of one of the drawers was my bank book.Dad had started it for me in my original childhood just after I’d turned thirteen, when I started getting a regular allowance of more than a few dollars. Apparently in this timeline, it had been started after Uncle Rich had died, and it looked like my parents had given me a fairly substantial allowance as well as regular payments that looked like they’d come from rent income based on the leasing out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. That hurt a bit, as I remembered my uncle who had died two years after mom, a very old man. For him to be cut down in the prime of his life by an AIDS epidemic that was much worse than anything I remembered and made me sad. It also gave me an appreciation for how much better Davey had made my world before we’d even met. Another thing I learned was that at least my father insisted that most of the money be invested into stocks. That was good because it had kept the other me from raiding the bank account for what I thought of as the “Marcie” depredations. At least he’d kept good records of all the money he’d spent on her.A diamond necklace?Diamond earrings and five hundred dollar watch?Nearly a hundred dollars every week for lunch?That might not have been a lot in 2050, but in 1986 that was a fortune! No, it was a good thing the bitch was gone from my life.The bank account was a lot leaner than it should be, but it was more than enough for my regular needs, and what was put back in stocks and other savings would be more than enough to see me through college.At least the money-pit hadn’t robbed me of a comfortable future. “Brian, it’s almost time for dinner!” Mom called out from the kitchen and I sighed before putting the bank documents back in my drawer.Things weren’t perfect, but they were a lot better than they could have been, I decided as I went to help set the table. Now, all I had to do was to secure a lasting friendship with my beloved. Chapter 6 “Are you sure about this, Brian?” Dad asked me as he looked over the paper given to me by the guidance counselor. “You’re a little more than halfway through the school year.” “It’s going to take a lot of work, but I can do it.” I assured my father who was looking at a form to approve several changes in my schedule. Two of my teachers had encouraged me to speak to my guidance counselor after the first tests towards the end of January. The conversation with the guidance counselor had been enlightening in more ways than one. I don’t think kids ever realized just how much some of the staff at school knew about what was going on, even in a school as large as Downey. Then again, I’d been fairly noticeable as a student, even in this timeline.My guidance counselor had heard that Marcie had gotten me to pick easier classes this year so I’d share more classes with her. After a discussion with several teachers, and an oral exam by two of them, I was approved for changing to college-prep courses in three subjects.It meant a lot of make-up work for me, but it would be worth it, and not only because I added another class to the number I shared with Davey, but because I would now have no classes with Marcie who was still being an absolute bitch. “What about baseball?” Dad said with a frown. “Can you do the extra work and still make practice as well as the games?” “Yes.” I said confidently and he looked at me for a long moment before signing the form.It was Friday night, and all I had to do was turn in the form on Monday morning and I’d be in my new classes.Baseball tryouts had been harder than I had expected, but then I hadn’t played baseball or softball in nearly twenty years. Still, I’d made the team, if only by the skin of my teeth. “Here you go.” Dad said with a smile as he handed the form back to me.We were sitting in the dining room where we’d just finished a round of Monopoly and Mom was now putting the game away.We’d all talked about the schedule change I wanted, and my mother had left us to finish the discussion.“If you run into problems, I expect you to talk with me about them.” “I will.” I assured him and he looked at me for a minute before nodding. “I actually believe you will now.” Dad said with a smile forming on his face.“You’ve finally got your head on straight, it seems.” “I’m trying.” I assured him. “I won’t say the obvious, but I’m glad that what happened earlier this month seems to have gotten you turned around.” Dad said. “I’ll be honest and say I was beginning to get worried about you.It wasn’t just the drinking and staying out all night, it was things like how much you were spending on her. A relationship should be about more than that, and I had thought you’d learned that from our talks.” “I don’t know what came over me.” I said with a shake of my head.“I only wish I’d realized what a leech she was earlier.” “You know it now, before it was too late.” Dad said in a comforting tone as Mom came back and sat down at the table. She had just gotten a perm today and her blond hair was practically bouncing in one of those typical hair-spray laden late-80’s hair styles.“Brian, there is something we should all talk about as a family.” “Okay.” I said softly, wondering what was going on and what it would all mean.This timeline was so different I couldn’t depend on any memories of it to guide me. “I know you’re as uncomfortable talking about your Uncle Rich as you are about your grandparents, but this sort of has to do with both of them.” Dad said and I narrowed my eyes while listening to him. The reference to Uncle Rich was obvious, and while it hurt that he’d died when he should have lived, it wasn’t something likely to set me off.What did my grandparents have to do with this? “Honey, you really shouldn’t blame yourself for their deaths.” Mom said softly, reaching out across the table towards me. I put my hand in hers and prepared to receive some bad news.My grandparents, at least on my father’s side, should be alive still, but it sounded like something had changed and they’d died.That brought tears to my eyes, but I’d already dealt with the grief over losing my kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids, but it was more for those I’d left behind in the other timeline than for news of my grandparents’ death. “Just because you wanted to spend Thanksgiving last year with Marcie’s parents doesn’t make you responsible for their dying in that crash.They chose to come out here, and it’s not your fault they died in the accident on the way down from Sacramento’s airport.No one could have known the fog would have been that bad, and they should have stopped in a hotel room instead of driving in it when it got real thick. They knew they weren’t use to driving in fog.” “It’s alright, Mom.” I said with a shaky breath and bit back a curse to be directed at Marcie and my other self from this timeline. It really wasn’t their fault, anymore than it was mine.There was no way I could have known this would happen when I reset the timelines and I certainly hadn’t caused it by going back in time. The news was sad news, but it wasn’t something I would blame myself for causing. “As you know, they left us quite a bit of money in their will.” Dad continued in a soft voice. They had been his parents after all, and part of me was amazed that there were no recriminations in his eyes. I was proud of him, the way he didn’t blame me even though he could have, and he could have allowed it to create a rift between us. This also explained some of the self-destructive behavior the other me had engaged in recently. “A few friends of your Uncle Rich have stayed in touch with your mother and I over the years, and they are starting up a new company in the Bay Area.They’ve offered to bring me in as a partner and CFO, that’s Chief Financial Officer.” “I know what a CFO is, Dad.” I said with a hint of sarcasm and he smiled gently. “It’s a good offer, and I think they have a good business model set-up.” Dad continued his explanation. “My experience in banking and the financial markets will be helpful.” “What kind of business is it?” I asked with some real interest.This was not something I remembered from the previous timeline. “It’s a marketing and public relations firm.” Dad explained.“Several of the partners have worked for other agencies and they want to form a new business together, focusing on the emerging businesses in Silicon Valley.” “Why are they approaching you?” I asked with a frown. “Your Uncle is one of the reasons.” Dad said softly with a look at Mom who smiled back at him in what was an encouraging way. “He helped a couple of them get their careers started before he got sick.Another is that I have enough venture capital to help them get off the ground, plus my financial degrees as well as my experience will help them with the banks and other lending institutions that they need for the rest of their venture capital.” “So you’re going to ask if I’m willing to move out there?” I asked, taking the information and moving to the next step. Mom’s hand tightened on mine for a moment while Dad smiled. “Actually it was to present you with a couple of options and to see if you think I should take the risk.” Dad said. “Don’t get me wrong, it is a risk.The business could fail and we could go broke over it, or it could succeed.Either way it’s going to mean a lot of work.It might be easier if we all moved to the Bay Area, but the fact is that you’ve lived all your life here and both your mother and I are loath to give up this house.” “I’d prefer not to move, even though it means a lot of commuting by you.” I said with some sympathy for my father. Sure, over the next twenty years many people would choose to live in this area and commute two hours each way to the Bay Area for work, but it was still hard. “I’ll only be working up there for two or three days a week to start with.” Dad said.“The rest of the work will be stuff I can do here from home. If it gets too bad, I’ll probably stay overnight there during the week and come back home on the weekends, but either way it does mean we’ll have to depend on you more to help your mother out around the house.” “That won’t be a problem.” I assured him and he nodded. “So you’re okay with this?” Mom asked. “I say we go for it.” I told both of them. “It’s a real opportunity.” “That it is, son.” Dad said as the phone rang and Mom got up to answer it. “It looks like from your new classes that you plan on going to college after all.” “I’d like to, yes.” I agreed and he nodded. “We’ll put enough money in a college savings account from my parent’s settlement so that you won’t have to worry about paying for college even if things go sour.” Dad assured me as Mom reentered the kitchen. “Brian, it’s Davey on the phone for you.” She said quietly and I looked over at the clock to see it was just after ten-thirty. It was a Friday night, and I was no longer grounded so it wasn’t past curfew, but it was a little late for a social call.Davey and I had gone to lunch together a few times since the day after my birthday, and he’d been at school every day, not missing any more classes, but with the start of baseball practice and his work, we hadn’t gotten together much after school. It was slightly frustrating, but I was determined to take this slow, and so far that had been working fairly well.We’d had a few good conversations when we’d gone to lunch and he had opened up a bit about his current situation at home, although most of it was about his mother’s upcoming surgery. “Thanks Mom.” I said as I got up from the table and headed to the phone in the kitchen, which was the one she’d used to pick up the call.“Davey?” “Hi.” Davey’s voice sounded stressed. Sure, he wasn’t the exact same Davey I’d known for decades, but he was close enough that I knew when he was stressed from the sound of his voice alone.“I’m sorry to call so late.” “It’s okay.” I told him quickly. “I was just talking with my parents.” “Oh, I um, sorry to interrupt.” He said nervously. “It’s just that… well I tried to call Todd but his parents are home and…” “What’s up?” I asked firmly. “I’m at work.” He said and the sounds in the background from his end suddenly made a lot of sense.“I just got off shift early and my car won’t start.I tried calling home but the line’s been busy and my grandparents don’t believe in call waiting and it’s probably my cousin or my sister, either of which means they’ll be on the phone until everyone goes to bed and like I said Todd is stuck with his parents so…” “You called me.” I finished for him and chuckled. “Dude, I’m glad you called. You want me to come pick you up?I can give you a ride home and then tomorrow we’ll go look at your car.Do you know what’s wrong with it?” “I think it’s the starter, but I’m not sure.” Davey said softly.“I’m really sorry to bug you about this, but…” “Dude, you’re a friend.” I assured him calmly. “Friends help each other out. Am I right that if it was me calling you, you’d help me out?” “Yeah, it’s just I don’t like needing the help.” Davey said sourly. “Look at from my perspective.” I encouraged him. “At least I’m getting to prove I mean it when I say we’re friends.” “You don’t need to prove that.” Davey said and I felt a blush fill my cheeks. “So where you at?” I asked him. “The McD’s on McHenry.” He said quickly. “Ouch, all the cruisers giving you a bad time?” I asked him with a chuckle and he made a non-committal noise.“Okay, I’ll be there in about twenty minutes.” “That long?” He asked with a hint of despair in his voice and then realized it might have sounded bad because he spoke up quickly. “Sorry, don’t mean it like that. It’s just my grandparents are really strict about locking the house up at eleven-thirty. If’ I’m not there by then I’ll have to find somewhere else to sleep.” “Then why don’t we not bother?” I asked quickly, although I was having mixed feelings about the offer I was about to make. “I’ll ask my parents if you can spend the night.Then we can get an earlier start with getting back to your car.” “Are you sure?” He asked with a bit of hope in his voice and I smiled even though he couldn’t see that smile. “Absolutely.” I assured him. “Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.” He said with a little more happiness in his voice.The only reason I’d been of a split mind about having him over was that I knew if I was to make it work with him I couldn’t give in to my desire for a physical relationship right now.We had to have a firm friendship first and then the sex could happen. Sure, as an old man it had been a while since I’d had sex with the Davey of the other timeline, and he wasn’t in as good physical shape as I was accustomed to seeing on my Davey, but he was still Davey and I wanted him.Could I control myself? “Mom, Dad, Davey’s car won’t start and he’s at work right now, needing a way home.” I told my parents as I reentered the dining room. “I don’t think we’ll worry about you being a little past curfew if you’re helping a friend out.” My father said with a smile and his eyes flashed approval.“It’s a good thing he felt like he could call you for help.” “I was wondering if you’d mind him spending the night?” I asked them and Mom looked at me with a frown. “Not that we would object to you having a friend over.” Mom began softly.“Lord knows you use to have Brandon or Trevor over all the time, but why now and with such short notice?” “Two reasons on that one.” I began cautiously. “First off, I told him I’d help him see what was wrong with his car, and in order to do that I’ll have to pick him up and drive him back there in the morning. It’ll be quicker if we’re both here in the morning instead of having to drive to Ceres to pick him up.” “Ceres?” Dad asked in surprise. “Why does he have to go to Ceres?” “It’s where he’s living.” I answered. “I thought he was living with his grandparents.” Mom stated. “He does, that’s where they live, in Ceres.” I explained. “Then how does he go to Downey?” Dad asked. “Shouldn’t he be going to Ceres High?” “He went there when he first moved back from Nevada.” I said carefully. I didn’t want to lie to them, but I didn’t know exactly what they might do if they knew the full truth. “He transferred to Downey last September.” “I didn’t know they’d let you do that.” Mom said. “Well, we better not keep you.” “What was your other reason for wanting him to stay the night?” Dad asked before I could make it out of the dining room. I turned back to look at him with a frown. “If he’s not home by eleven-thirty his grandfather won’t let him in the house.” I answered and Dad frowned deeply. “Brian, honey, you want me to make up a place for him on the sofa or do you mind sharing your bed?” Mom asked in a fierce tone. “I’ve been thinking that I really should clean up the mess in the guest bedroom since I’ve been doing so much with the charity that I don’t sew quite as much.If I cleaned it up, we could have that twin bed in there for your guests.” “I don’t mind sharing.” I assured her and she nodded. “You have clean sheets on your bed?” She asked me sternly. “I just put them on yesterday.” My answer met her approval. “Get going then.” She told me curtly and I smiled at my parents and their soft-hearted nature as I rushed to my bathroom. I’d been wearing a pair of jogging short and a white t-shirt for most of the evening since dinner finished and so I quickly pulled on a pair of tight 501’s and peach and white striped polo before grabbing my car keys and heading towards the front door. I could hear my parents talking about plans for cleaning up the guest bedroom and I smiled to myself at their transparency. For whatever reason, they liked and felt sorry for the Davey of this timeline, and they were planning on reaching out to him. “I’m going now!” I called out to them. “Hold on a minute.” Dad called out and I waited near the front door for him to come out of the dining room. He held out his hand stuffed with a wad of money and pressed it into mine.“Take him out for a soda or something.Just be quiet when you get back, okay?” “Thanks.” I replied and he nodded before patting me on the shoulder and walking towards the living room where Mom was turning on the television.I had tears in my eyes as I got into my car and started it up.My parents really were good people. I knew that cruising was a tradition all across the nation, but in Modesto it held a special significance as a teen ritual.During the mid-nineties, local governments began cracking down on the decades-old tradition, pretty much outlawing it in cities all across the nation.In Modesto of the mid-eighties though, the tradition immortalized in George Lucas’s American Graffiti still held strong.While the movie had been filmed elsewhere, it had been based on the filmmaker’s experiences cruising up and down McHenry Avenue in Modesto. Every year, the town celebrated the movie with a weekend celebration in June that had lasted all the way up until the year I came back in time. That meant going anywhere on McHenry, a main North/South street in central Modesto would take forever.Fortunately there were a lot of side streets that could be used to get to the McDonald’s that Davey was at, and I was there in just a little over twenty minutes. He was sitting on the hood of his Pontiac J2000 and a frown filled my face at the sight of him smoking a cigarette.Sure, he’d told me once that he’d smoked in his first timeline, and that he’d started at seventeen, but he’d also quit after his first trip back in time. As I pulled up next to him, he threw the butt on the ground and hopped off the hood.He didn’t need a lecture from me about smoking, and for now I decided to ignore that aspect of him in the here and now.There would be plenty of time to get him to quit.With the family history of cancer that he had, he didn’t need to be puffing on those things. “Hey.” He called as I reached over and unlocked the door for him.Davey got in, along with a stench of smoke and hamburger grease and threw his bag into the back seat. At least he still had the habit of fastening his seat belt as soon as he got in a car. “Sorry it took me so long.” I said instead of complaining about the cigarette smell. “No problem, I got in touch with my mother.” He said with a frown.“My damn cousin was on the phone all night talking to some loser she’s dating. She’s pissed because she wanted to go out with him but Nanny insisted she look after the baby for once.Of course as soon as it’s bedtime, Nanny will be taking the baby into her bed.Mom says it’s fine for me to stay over, but she’s worried about the car and what it’ll cost.” “Let’s worry about that tomorrow.” I said with a smile as I pulled out.“You want to stop for a bite to eat or a soda?Dad gave me some money…” “Dressed like this?” He asked as he plucked at his polyester Mickey D uniform.“Besides I stink.” “You can say that again.” I muttered, and looked askance until he started laughing. “I’d actually prefer to get a shower, if you don’t mind.” He said shyly and I nodded, pulling into the heavy cruising traffic. Right away, I realized things could be worse when I looked over at the car next to me and saw Marcie glaring at me. Well, she was really glaring at me and at Davey in the seat next to me.Davey was rambling on about what a bad day he’d had at work and how his car breaking down was just the icing on the cake, and about his worries regarding how he was going to afford a new starter while all I could do was return Marcie’s glare as traffic inched forward.She blinked first but turned around with one last spiteful glance, and her head disappeared from view.Considering she was in the car with Mark Richards, a guy from the baseball team, and the look of first surprise and then lust that crossed his face told me what she was doing. I didn’t need to see a bit of hair bob into view for a moment, or the look of fear on his face as he looked over to see me watching to know what was going on over there. I just shook my head and turned to talk to Davey, actually feeling sorry for Mark being used by the bitch. Maybe I should warn him? When we got back to the house, Mom and Dad were sitting on the couch, watching the evening news.The news show was profiling Christa McAuliffe, and I felt guilty for a moment, but there was nothing I could do about her or the Challenger at this point. I clearly remembered that being one of the things Davey had stopped from happening, and I even remembered him telling me about it being next Tuesday, but who would believe me at this point? “You boys are back early.” Mom said as we entered the living room. “Davey wanted a shower more than anything else.” I said with a smile.“Frankly, I think that was a good idea.” “Brian!” Mom chided me although she was laughing as Davey mock-punched me in the arm. “Be nice, son.” Dad said but he was smiling too. “Here, let me get you all set for a shower.” Mom said as she got up from the couch and headed off to show Davey where the towels and other stuff were located. “Here’s the money back.” I said pulling the two twenties out of my pocket and handing them back to Dad, but he waved them off. “Take him out to lunch tomorrow, or help him get his car fixed.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You sure?” I asked him and he nodded. “That kid needs a few lucky breaks in his life.” Dad said softly. “He’s my age, you know.” I reminded Dad who smiled. “Actually he’s a week older than you.” Dad reminded me. “Brian, I gave him a pair of your sweatpants and an old shirt of yours.” Mom said as she returned to the living room with Davey’s bag in her hands.“His stuff needs to be washed and he says he has work tomorrow night so he’ll need his uniform washed.I’m going to start them now.” “Thanks Mom.” I said and she nodded before heading out towards the garage with the dirty clothes. I sat down on the couch with Dad and watched the beginning of the late-night talk shows.I’d forgotten how funny Johnny Carson was in his monologue. Would he feel bad about his ‘Teacher in Space’ jokes after the Challenger exploded? “I feel much better.” Davey said as he came out of the bathroom twenty minutes later, wearing an old pair of gray sweatpants and a blue t-shirt that was a bit tight on him. He really could stand to lose about twenty pounds, and his longish hair needed a good trim, but he was still a handsome man. “Glad to hear that.” Dad said in a show of genuine affection.“If you boys want to watch television a bit, I think Brian’s mom and I are about to head to bed. Don’t stay up all night, and try to keep it quiet.” “We will.” I assured him, standing to give him a hug before he left.When Mom passed through the kitchen, she got another hug from me, and I was surprised when she hugged Davey as well. From his look, he was just as surprised. “There’s a plate of snacks on the kitchen table if you boys want some before you go to bed.” She said with a smile before heading off into the bedroom. “Hungry?” I asked Davey and he nodded shyly before following me into the kitchen.He frowned at the plate of cheese, but set right into the bowl of grapes. I got both of us glasses of milk before nibbling on the cheese. “I really appreciate this.” Davey said after a moment of silence. “I’m happy you called me.” I said honestly. “I thought Marcie was going to shoot death beams out of her eyes when she saw us.” Davey said with a little giggle and I joined him by chuckling softly. “You saw her then?” I asked. “How could I miss it when she went down on Mark?” Davey said with a leer. “God I’m glad I broke up with that slut.” I muttered and Davey laughed. “Most guys would have been happy to have a slut for a girlfriend.” Davey chortled. “I’m not.” I admitted honestly and he raised an eyebrow.Maybe this was a good time to lay some groundwork. “Why’s that?” Davey asked with real curiosity in his voice before he started blushing and looked down at the bowl of grapes. “Sorry, maybe that was a little too personal.I have this bad habit of just asking what’s on my mind.It always made my dad crazy.” “That’s okay; I can always refuse to answer a question.” I said and winked at him when he looked up at me. His shoulders had hunched up while he’d spoken, but now he relaxed a bit more and so did I.Whenever his shoulders hunched up like that, I got worried for him, and it was good to see him be more relaxed and natural.“I remember when my dad first gave me the birds and bees talk. He told me that no matter who I dated, sex should always be something special, a symbol of our commitment to each other, a lifelong commitment and not just something of the moment. Sex should be something special, shared only with the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess with Marcie, you could say I forgot that and I shouldn’t have because he was right, you know.” “Wow, all my dad told me was to never bring a nigger, spic, or gook chic home.” Davey snorted and I shook my head in disgust. President Jones would never have told his son that, but I guess the David Jones Sr. of this timeline had, and once again I missed the time I had grown up in, with the world Davey had created. “Ouch.” I said aloud and Davey nodded. “I thought he was a preacher.” “I thought he was too.” Davey said so sourly that I winced inwardly. “Davey, I hope you know that my folks and I, we don’t judge you by what your father has or has not done.” I said softly and Davey shook his head. “You’d be about the only people in the fucking county that haven’t.” He muttered with more bitterness than I could ever remember hearing from Davey before in any lifetime. “Sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you. You’ve been really cool.Why is that anyway?Is it because you feel sorry for me?” “I do feel sorry for you, yes.” I admitted and he frowned fiercely.“That’s not why I want to be your friend though.You’re a good guy, I can tell that, and you’ve been dealt a pretty fucking shitty hand by life, but none of that’s your fault.Despite all the shit you’ve been put through, you’re still a good guy. You care about your sister and your mother, and since we’ve been getting to know each other, you’ve shown you have a wicked sense of humor and make some pretty funny comments. I like that about you, and you’ve been helping me study some and that’s helped me out, and my other friends have all but abandoned me since I broke up with Marcie, but you could care less about that.” “Actually I don’t think I’d hang around you if you were still with her.” Davey said, surprising me with that comment. “That bitch – sorry but she is – she’s bad news and I don’t want to have anything to do with her or those bitches she hangs with.” “Why not?” I asked and he shrugged while plopping a grape into his mouth and chewing silently for a moment. “It’s nothing I can put my finger on, but just a feeling I get.” He answered.“It’s something to do with the way she looks at people.She looks at them like she’s measuring up what they can do for her, or give her and that’s all she cares about.Someone like that, it’s best to steer away from.” “I wish you’d been there to warn me off when I first started dating her.” I said in all honestly and he chuckled. “Sorry, I was stuck at Ceres Fucking High.” He said sourly.“Now that was a real pit-hole, let me tell you.” “At least you’re out of there now.” I reminded him and he laughed softly before stopping and looking towards the hallway leading to my parents’ room with a worried frown. “Don’t worry, the worst they’ll do is tell us to shut up and get to bed.” I assured him and he relaxed before getting a look of curiosity on his face. “Where am I going to sleep tonight?” Davey asked. “Your mom mentioned something about it being next week before they would have the guest room cleaned up.” “You can sleep in my bed, if you don’t mind.” I said with a shrug that I hoped appeared to be casual while there were butterflies in my stomach.My old mind and young body were going to war with each other all night and I’d probably not sleep at all, but at the same time it was a sweet agony that I longed for, to have him next to me again, if only for a night. “That’s fine, if you don’t mind.” He agreed and I nodded, breathing slowly so as to not look like I was sighing in relief. “I don’t.” I assured him. “What time do you want to get up in the morning?” “It should be as early as possible.” Davey said. “I really do appreciate all your help you know.I’ve got to work tomorrow night so if I can get the car fixed easily we should do it in the morning. Then I can go home and get yelled at for a bit before going to work.” “Why would they yell at you?” I asked with concern. “Oh it’s just my grandfather.” Davey said with a shake of his head.I found that the strangest of all the differences.Pete and Davey had gotten along like two peas in a pod before. What had changed so drastically. “He’s still pissed that I went over to see my dad a few times after he came back to California. That’s when he started locking me out if I got home after eleven-thirty.Every time I get home late, he thinks I’m out seeing my dad or something.” “P… Your grandfather doesn’t like your father, I take it?” I asked, almost slipping and calling his grandfather by his first name. “Yeah, Papa’s never really liked Dad and this whole mess proves that he’s always been right about Dad.” Davey said with a frown and a heavy sigh.“It doesn’t matter to him that the only reason I went over there was to confront Dad and make him admit what he did to my sister, and I actually hit him!I fucking punched him in the gut, made him double over and every thing, but no, none of that matters to Papa. Now he thinks I’m taking Dad’s side in everything every time he or Nanny start bitching about Dad. I mean, sure Dad fucked up big time and he’s really messed up all our lives, but they don’t have to fucking put him down with every damn other word out of their mouths!” “No, they don’t.” I agreed with him, hoping my parents wouldn’t react badly to the rising voice. I could hear some shuffling from the hallway, but fortunately Davey was too far gone into his grief and anger to notice.He raised his light blue eyes, tears filling them, and a long moment of silence passed between us as he searched my eyes and face for any hint of sarcasm or derision, or any other negative reaction. “I do love him still, you know.” Davey said in a voice that shook, and a part of me knew that he’d never shared this with anyone else yet, and a deep sense of honor filled me. Once, just once, my Davey had shared part of this with me, but it had been a hundred years of his lifetime since these events had happened, and the grief had been old.Here, now, it was fresh, and the wounds were still bleeding in his heart. “He’s your father.” I said softly and Davey’s eyes were latched onto mine.“Of course you love him.” “Then why don’t they see that?” Davey asked as his shoulders began to shake with suppressed sobs. “Why do they have to be so damn angry and badmouth him every chance they get?” “Maybe they’re hurt and don’t know any other way to express the hurt.” I offered and he seemed to mull over the statement. “Davey, it doesn’t justify them hurting you in the process, but it might explain why…” “It’s so fucking unfair!” Davey growled before giving in to the tears with a sniffle.His eyes were leaking the tears now and he wiped his nose with the back of a hand. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be…” “Shhh.” I said softly, moving my chair around the table towards him, and when I reached my arms out he fell into them, resting his head on my shoulder as he just sobbed.“Let it out, Davey, you can let it out here.” “It’s just so unfair.” He moaned again while his entire body shook. I looked up to see my parents standing in the doorway with looks of sorrow and approval mixed on their faces. They nodded briefly before my father put an arm around my mother, who was wearing her rose-colored nightgown, and they walked back to their room.Davey was oblivious to their presence as he cried into my shoulder for a long time. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you like this…” “Promise me you’ll return the favor if I ever need it.” I said softly as he pulled back from leaning on me.For a long time he looked deeply into my eyes before nodding. “If you ever need me, I’ll be there.” He promised fervently and I smiled. “Good, I can always use a good friend.” I said just as fervently and he actually smiled in response to me. “You about ready for bed?” “Yeah, I could use some sleep.” He said with a yawn, and we put the empty glasses of milk away before heading into my room. Davey paused hesitantly when I shut the door behind me and looked at me with a questioning expression. “Um right or left side?” “I’ll take the right.” I said, remembering how he always liked sleeping on the left.He nodded, and turned his back to me as he began to get undressed. I could see the way he sneaked a look at me as I got ready for bed, but when I climbed into bed after him, there was a good arm’s length between us.He let out a heavy sigh as he fell asleep with his back to me, but I lay awake for a long time, listening to his breathing. Part of me still missed my Davey, and our kids, but another part of me was looking forward to a new lifetime, knowing the man I had spent so many years loving was still here, deep down in this Davey Jones. Chapter 7 “Boys, you better get a move on if you want some of this food mom’s cooking!” Dad’s voice, and his fist banging on the door woke me up the next morning and I started with surprise. Sometime during the night, the arm’s length between us had disappeared, and my arms were wrapped around Davey, who had his back to me. My morning erection was sticking out the top of my underwear, and it was nestled tightly against Davey’s back, where he could probably feel it as he stirred. With flaming cheeks, I pushed myself back a bit from him, but didn’t remove my arms from around him. He was shifting now, and I wondered if I could casually move my hands down from his chest and feel his own morning erection, and part of me wanted to do that, but I knew it was not time for that yet.Still, it was nice having him in my arms. “We’re getting up, dad!” I called out and my father moved off.To my surprise, Davey started chuckling and actually leaned back against me, although he arched his back so it wouldn’t come into contact with my erection. “Good morning.” I whispered to him, and he started laughing harder.“What’s so funny?” “Oh, I don’t know.” Davey whispered and turned sideways so he could look at my face.There was a broad smile on his.“Marcie would have a coronary if she walked in now, and your dad probably would too. Thanks though.I hope it’s not too freaky for you waking up like this.I had a nightmare and the next thing I knew you were hugging me and it just…” “I’m not freaked out.” I assured him and he arched an eyebrow with a semi-familiar leer on his face. “Really, what about if I did this?” He said before leaning forward like he was going to kiss me.I pulled back and slapped his chest, causing him to push my hands away and they ended up on his belly. “Dude, what the fuck is this?” I asked, slapping his belly and he frowned before defensively pushing my hands away. “I know I need to lose weight.” He grumbled. “It’s just tough you know, working in a fucking fast food place and never really having all that much time for a real meal, and Nanny’s always pushing food at me as if that’ll make the world better and I don’t have any time for exercise.” “Bullshit.” I said firmly, sitting up enough to rest my head on my right hand while looking at him sternly. “We’ll make time.I tell you what, I usually run three times a week in the mornings. You and I will meet at the school an hour before school starts and go running.” “You want me to give up an hour of sleep?” Davey said with a startled look.“Do you know how little sleep I get as it is?I can’t even crawl into bed until after Nanny and Papa finish watching the news. Then it’s another thirty minutes before they finish locking up, setting the alarms and actually get into bed.” “I thought you couldn’t go home if it was after eleven-thirty and they’re still up?” I exclaimed in confusion and he frowned. “Nanny would try to sneak me in, but if I’m not back yet, Papa gets up five minutes early and turns on the alarm.” Davey answered. “She doesn’t know the code and he won’t tell anyone else at all, and he’s the type that would wait for the police to show up and have them haul me off.” “Sometimes I don’t get your grandfather at all.” I said, full well being able to imagine Pete doing that if he was pissed enough. “Yeah, well, enough of that.” Davey said with false cheerfulness.“Whatever your mom’s cooking sure smells good.” “I’ve got dibs on the shower.” I said with a smile as I hopped out of bed.Davey just stretched before laying back down, and I couldn’t help but smile as I noticed him pulling my pillow to him when he thought I’d left the room. Mom had delivered Davey’s clean clothes while I was in the shower and he was already dressed as I entered with nothing but a towel around my waist.He blushed before stammering out that he’d be in the dining room, and I smirked to myself. Davey was such a contradiction, fluctuating between being flirty with me and embarrassed about being caught looking at me.Since we’d probably be leaving soon after breakfast, I dressed in an old pair of jeans and equally old shirt that was only a little tight, but it did show off my chest fairly well. Davey was wearing the clothes he’d worn to school yesterday, although they were freshly cleaned by mom. “You young men mind if I go along with you?” Dad asked as we ate the pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs that mom had cooked. “I was once a fair hand with cars.” “Sure.” Davey said after looking at me for approval.If Dad wanted to help, I wasn’t going to argue.He was definitely better than me when it came to cars. “Good, after we finish here I’ll get my tools.” Dad said and Davey breathed a sigh of relief. “I was worried I might have to ask my father for help.” He said in answer to dad’s questioning look. “When I wrecked mom’s car after getting my license he had to help me fix the rear axle I bent.” “Don’t worry about that.” Dad said firmly, but there was a gentle smile on his face that seemed to encourage Davey. “I appreciate all the help you’re giving me.” Davey said politely, but the undertones in his voice showed how much he meant every word. “It’s nothing.” Mom said with a smile. “Besides, if it’s keeping Brian out of trouble, it’s all to the good.” “Hey!” I protested, but she was already laughing with dad.When breakfast was done, we headed out and dad followed us in his car after loading it with some tools. Davey kept up an easy monologue for a while, talking about a friend of his from Nevada.It was obvious he missed the place, and had been happy there.From what my Davey had told me of the place and living there the second time he’d gone back, I could understand this Davey missing the place. “What the hell?” Davey asked as we pulled into the parking lot of the McDonald’s.Like all the employees he parked near the back, and as we pulled into the spot next to his car, I could see why he was upset.Both tires on this side were flat, and more than likely the other two were as well, which we learned after getting out of the car and looking at the other side. Dad pulled up behind us, and was looking at the car with a grim expression while Davey fingered the slit edge of the rear driver’s side tire.Someone had done a good job slitting his tires, and a rage built in my gut as I took a good guess as to who was responsible. “I’m going to fucking kill her.” I said in a very loud voice while a slender, older woman in a manager’s uniform walked out of the restaurant. “Brian, watch your language!” Dad said sharply as Davey stood up and turned around.His eyes were moist, and his lower lip quivered. I wanted to wrap my arms around him and comfort him, but I knew that this was not the place or the time. “How am I going to pay for this?” Davey moaned softly.“Jenny’s psychotherapist needs to be paid and I have to make the car payment and I could barely scrounge up enough for a starter and…” “David?” The female manager asked in a worried tone.“I’m sorry David, I tried calling your house to tell you this morning when I came in but they said you were over at a friend’s.” “I… my car wouldn’t start last night and Brian picked me up.” Davey said in a weak voice. He shook his head slightly as she moved to stand next to him.“Janice, the tires were fine when I left last night.” “They were fine when the closers left.” Janice said in a worried tone.“I don’t understand why someone would do this, you’re the sweetest boy here.” “It wasn’t someone from the restaurant.” I said through gritted teeth and Davey looked up at me with a worried look. “She wouldn’t do this, would she?” He asked and his lower lip started quivering again.“Why would she do this to me?” “Why do you think Marcie did this, Brian?” Dad asked in a low, quiet tone that was still filled with fatherly command. “She saw us last night when we were pulling out of the restaurant, and she gave us both a dirty look.” I said, not wanting to get into the part about her going down on Spencer. Had she gotten him to do it?In a selfish way I hoped it had been him and not – not Trevor or Brandon. “So you think she’d take her anger out on David?” Dad said with a questioning tone.“That doesn’t make a lot of sense.” “Who is this Marcie?” Janice asked coldly. “Brian’s ex-girlfriend.” Davey said softly. “What would she have against you?” Janice asked him. “It’s not so much Davey directly as anyone she sees me with.” I explained what I thought was her reasoning. Yeah, I was calming down, but I was still pissed. While I seriously doubted Brandon or Trevor might say something to her about my interest in Davey, I was seriously regretting having ever shared that with them. “She’s a vindictive bi–woman.” “If she ever comes into my restaurant, I want you to point her out to me, you hear me David?” Janice said vehemently. “I want to throw her out on her ass and never let her back in here.” “Thanks, Janice.” Davey said with a slight chuckle that faded away as he looked back at his car.That was when I noticed that dad wasn’t by us anymore, but was at the payphone near the entrance. “It’s not a problem, David, and I want you to take the day off to get this fixed.” She said firmly and Davey started to protest. “I can’t, I’m going to need the money more now that I have to pay for all this!”He protested vehemently. “I’m paying you for the day as long as you keep your mouth shut about me being anything other than a cranky old witch, you hear me?” She said in a tone that brooked no argument. He sighed before swallowing glumly and looking at her for a long moment. “Thank you.” He said softly and she patted him on the back before heading back inside.Davey turned to look at the car again, and his shoulders started to shake again. Damn appearances to hell, I decided and stepped up beside him, putting an arm over his shoulder and pulling him in tight for a one-armed hug. “I’m supposed to be the one who helps people, not the one getting help.” Davey muttered bitterly. “This isn’t your fault.” I told him softly. “I’m sorry she did this and I want to help fix it, okay?” “I’ll figure something out.” Davey muttered. “Davey, I bear some responsibility for this.” I said firmly.“Let me pay my part, please.” “I’ve called a tow-truck.” Dad said as he approached us again. I looked up from Davey’s car to see him nodding in approval at my comforting Davey. “I’ll pay for it, Mr. B.” Davey said and a fleeting smile crossed my lips at the fond shortening of my father’s last name that he’d used in the last timeline, first as Mr. B and then as Dad B as time went by. “You’ll do no such thing.” Dad said in a voice that jerked Davey’s head up. “But it’s my car and…” Davey started to protest and Dad held up a hand to stop him from going any further. “David, I’m going to ask you a few questions and I want you to answer them honestly, okay?” Dad asked in a softer tone. “If, after I’m done asking them, you still don’t want my help that will be that, okay?” “Okay.” Davey said sullenly. “What do you do with most of your paycheck?” Dad asked, already knowing the answer. “Most of it goes to help Mom and Jenny.” Davey answered. “I make my car payments, insurance, gas and all that with the rest.” “You’ve told me that before, so it was just a warm-up.” Dad said.“Now, here’s the important question, if you have to pay for tires and the repairs to your car, how is that going to affect the rest of your family?” “Jenny will have to miss a few sessions, and she’s just starting to make real progress.” Davey said with a frown. “I’ll end up behind on the car payments too, and since Nanny co-signed the loan she’ll have to make them up until I can pay her back and that’ll make it more difficult to stay in the city, even with your help, while mom has her surgery.” “Would you object to me helping out your sister, your mother, or your grandmother?” Dad asked and I smiled at where he was going with this.It was like he knew Davey almost as well as I did, and it was just the right argument to use. I should have thought of this first, what with how well I knew Davey’s stubborn pride. “No.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Then think of it as helping you help them.” Dad said gently and Davey nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Breckenridge.” He said to my father. “You’re a good young man, David.” Dad said firmly, staring into Davey’s eyes.“Don’t let life’s little challenges bow you down, and don’t refuse help freely offered with no strings attached.” “I’ll pay you back, I promise.” Davey said firmly. “How about you pay me back some other way than money?” Dad asked. “Like what?” Davey asked as a tow-truck pulled into the parking lot. “Let me think on that for a while.” Dad asked him. “I promise, we’ll work something out, but I don’t want to take needed cash away from your family.” “As long as we can work something out.” Davey said stubbornly and Dad reached out his hand for them to shake on it. As the tow-truck driver got out, I dropped my arm from around Davey’s shoulders, and he straightened up a bit as Dad went to talk to the driver. “I never should have called you for help last night.” Davey sighed softly, more to himself than to me, and I knew what he was saying.He wasn’t blaming me, he was blaming himself. “You’re right.” I said firmly and he looked up in surprise.“If you hadn’t called me you’d have not had your tires slashed.I’m sorry.” “That’s not what I meant!” Davey protested, but when he saw me smiling he stopped and started chuckling. “Okay, I get your point.” “Good, don’t forget it again.” I said as sternly as I could. “Brian you need to move your car for the driver to get David’s car on the flatbed.” Dad said to me as he finished talking with the beefy truck driver.“David, you’ve got the day off, and I’m going to head over to the garage with the tow-truck to get things started.It’s a good thing I know one that’s open today.If they can’t get it done today, Brian will drive you around to where you need to go for the weekend since he bears some obligation based on what he thinks happened. If you want to spend the night again, you’re more than welcome.I do suggest you stop by your house to let your family know you’re okay, though.” “We can do that first.” I said with a smile before Davey could protest.He took one look at my father’s face and slowly nodded his agreement. “Good, now Brian, here’s your allowance for the week, have fun with it.” Dad said, handing me another wad of cash, and I knew it wasn’t my allowance.Breaking all conventions of being a teenager, I hugged my father there in plain view of anyone driving by, and he patted me on the back before pushing me off towards my mustang. Davey stuck his hand out and my dad pulled him in for a hug too.Unlike me, Davey stayed in the hug a bit longer, soaking up the affection my father was so freely offering, and he was almost smiling when he got into the car. He’d handed Dad the keys to his car before getting into mine. “So, we’re off!” I said in high spirits, pretending not to notice how he looked back at his car with a worried look before I pulled onto McHenry and headed south towards Ceres. Davey sat quietly for most of the drive, brooding most likely about his car and I knew enough not to bother him as I turned onto J Street before heading down 9th towards Ceres.He snapped out of the brooding when I pulled onto Highway 99, which 9th Street turned into just south of the only gay dance club in Modesto. “You need to take Whitmore.” Davey said softly and I nodded.He then spoke only to give me directions, which I followed without telling him I knew where his grandparents lived.I’d been to both their houses in the last timeline, and both his mother’s parents and his father’s mother had lived in their houses until they’d died in the last timeline. They were right around the corner from each other, and I had never appreciated how rough that must have been in this timeline, when the two sides of his family blamed each other for the problems associated with Davey’s father. If I remembered it correctly, and I was certain I did, Grandma Jones blamed Davey’s mother for having Davey’s father arrested. Davey’s mother rightly blamed his father for what he’d done to Jenny.She’d pressed charges so that Jenny could get help from the state for her counseling but that had only lasted a year and now Davey was helping to make the payments for the continued counseling. Davey’s grandparents’ home was the same ugly dark green I remembered it being in this timeframe, and I recognized his mother’s RX-7 parked in front of it, plus the large brown Buick his grandmother drove, as well as the large light-brown van that was his grandfather’s. I parked in by his mother’s car, and got out with him. “You sure about having me over for the weekend?” Davey asked me.“I’ve got to work tomorrow too.” “It won’t be a problem.” I assured him. “We can work on our history project later.” “Okay.” Davey said and then he paused before the sidewalk that led up to the house.There was a frown on his face.“I should warn you, it’s barely ten in the morning and my grandmother and mother usually lounge around in their nightgowns until around noon.” “Don’t worry, I’m not going to embarrass you at school.” I assured him with a laugh, remembering a few times we’d come over here in the last timeline to find his grandmother still in her furry pink housecoat at two in the afternoon on Saturdays.He chuckled for a moment before getting his brooding look back and we headed up to the door.The fact that Davey didn’t have a key to the door wasn’t really a surprise considering his grandfather’s attitude, but I wondered how a person could call anyplace a home when he didn’t have the keys to get inside. “You’re home!” Monta Barrow, Davey’s grandmother said after Davey had rung the doorbell.Sure enough she was wearing her fuzzy pink robe.She looked slightly embarrassed when she saw me standing behind Davey. “Who is this?” “Nanny, this is my friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Davey said softly.“Brian, this is my grandmother, Monta Barrow.” “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Barrow.” I said politely and she smiled slightly. “I wish I’d known you were bringing company, Davey!” She chided him in a loving tone. “I’m just lounging here in my robe having a cup of coffee!Come in, boys. It’s nice to meet you, Brian.” The house was exactly as I remembered it being, with the kitchen immediately off to the right and a short entryway leading off to the right towards the living room and a hallway down the left leading to the bedrooms and bathrooms.Right at the end of the entryway was a big mirror running from floor to ceiling, and I was struck by how young I looked in the reflection. Every time I saw myself, I was reminded at how young I looked when just a short while ago I had looked far older than Davey’s grandmother. “Are you boys hungry?” She asked as she led us through the kitchen towards the attached dining room where Davey’s mother was sipping a cup of hot tea, wearinga black velvet robe with red piping.Her brown curly hair was slightly matted and her eyes had a pinched look to them, probably from pain, as Davey introduced us. “No thanks, Nanny, Brian’s mom made breakfast for us a few hours ago.” Davey answered his grandmother’s question. “What’s wrong with your car?” Davey’s mother said shortly, and I realized it was more from the fact that she was having trouble breathing than from anger.Davey might not have realized that from the defensive look on his face. “The starter’s gone bad on it.” Davey said, and when he said nothing about the tires, I took the hint and decided not to mention them.“It’s being fixed.” “Oh great, how are we going to afford that?” His mother moaned and I was amazed at how different she was than the self-confident, always calm and prepared woman I’d known in the last timeline. “Brian’s father is paying for it.” Davey said weakly.“He’s loaning me the money.” “The same man who is helping us with a place to stay in the city?” Nanny asked as she sat down with her cup of coffee. Davey and I both sat at the large oval table as well. “Yes, the same man.” Davey said softly. “Your father is truly a Christian man.” Nanny said to me and it was hard not to laugh.Dad hadn’t set foot inside a church in years, but I understood her sentiment. “Why would he do that?” Davey’s mom asked. “What’s in it for him?” “I’ll pay him back, it’s just a loan.” Davey said, stretching the truth just a bit, but from the way his mother relaxed slightly I got the feeling it was the right thing to say. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work in a little bit?” His mother asked him sharply, and I began to wonder at the deep differences she was showing.It was almost like she was going out of her way to find things wrong with Davey, and that worried me more than anything.Maybe it was just the pain she was in right now. “Janice gave me the day off, with pay.” Davey said defensively, his face clouding over. “I asked Davey if we could use the time to work on our history project some more.” I said, jumping into the fray when she opened her mouth to say something.It was probably going to be something scathing from the look on her face, but she looked at me with cloudy eyes, as if seeking to find something wrong with what I said. “Who is this?” A familiar gruff voice asked from the kitchen and I looked up to see Davey’s grandfather standing near the coffee pot, pouring himself a cup of coffee.He was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt and had a grumpy look on his face. “This is one of Davey’s friends.” Nanny answered in a knowing tone of voice.I stood up and took a few steps towards him with my hand held out as he looked me up and down. “My name is Brian Breckenridge, Mr. Barrow.” I said in a polite voice, shaking his hand firmly as he squeezed mine in a testing manner.He looked me in the eyes for a long moment before letting a grunt. “A sight better than that other boy Davey brought around a couple of weeks ago.” He harrumphed before releasing my hand and sitting down at the head of the table.“What’s wrong with that stupid car of yours now, Davey?” “Starter’s out, Papa.” Davey said. “You going to want my help to fix it?” He asked as if the notion was a noxious idea, but I was pretty sure I saw a glint of something deep in his eyes. “Um, Brian’s dad is having it worked on.” Davey said.“He’s loaning me the money to fix it and I’ll pay him back.” “See that you do, boy.” Papa said gruffly, and while there was a hint of disappointment in his eyes, I could see there was also a grudging respect.Was it respect because Davey had found a solution to the problem without having to get help? That would fit the Pete Barrow I’d known before. “I will, Papa.” Davey said plaintively, getting a frown from the old man. “What’s your father do, young man?” Pete asked me directly and I smiled. “He’s a manager at Union Bank in Modesto.” I answered and he frowned for a moment. “I think I know him.” Pete said with a shake of his head.“You’ve got his eyebrows if it’s him that I remember.” “You know him.” I said with a slight laugh and he nodded his head.The man always did make me a little nervous.“Have you been fishing lately?I saw your boat around the side of the house.” “It’s too damn cold right now.” He grunted. “You fish?” “A little.” I admitted honestly. “Dad and I usually try to make it up for a camping trip during the spring at least once a year.” “I’ll have to invite him the next time I go.” Pete said as if it was a burden, but I could see a little gleam in his eye. “Kind of in the way of thanking him for his helping the family.Maybe we’ll drag you two boys with us.” “I…” Davey started to try backing out from the look on his face, but my stomping on his foot stopped him cold. “That’d be nice, Mr. Barrow.” I said calmly, ignoring the glare from Davey.“I’m sure my dad would like to do that.” “Good.” He said with a nod before getting up from his seat.“You boys going to hang around here today or what?” “We’ve got a history project to work on for school, sir.” I said and he looked at me for a long moment. “You better make sure he puts some effort into it.” Pete said with a scowl.“If he wants to get into college he’s going to have to work harder at his books than he has been.” “We will.” I said while Davey scowl returned. “Good, then it’s been nice meeting you.” Pete said before taking his coffee with him into the living room where he used the patio sliding door to get into the back yard.Davey was staring at me like I was a demon or something, and his grandmother and mother were also looking at me like they’d never seen someone like me before.It was then that I realized why I’d liked Pete so much.He reminded me so much of Davey when Davey got older, although Davey was never quite as gruff. “So how long will you be gone, Davey?” His mother asked him after a long silence while everyone stared at me.It seemed that, with Pete’s approval of Davey going to study at my house, the matter was settled. “Um, I have to work early in the afternoon tomorrow and Brian’s offered to give me a ride, so I was going to ask if I could stay over at his place tonight.” Davey said softly. “What’ll you do if your car’s not fixed by Monday?” His grandmother asked.“I’ve got to take your mother to the city for a doctor’s appointment Monday, and she’s got to go for more tests here in town for most of Tuesday.” “I can either pick him up or drop him off here, or he can stay at our place until his car is fixed.” I spoke up before Davey could answer.“My parents said it was okay.They understand how tough things are right now, and that your first priority has to be getting ready for your surgery.” “That’s mighty kind of your folks.” Monta Barrow said with a smile.“Shantill’s mother is going to be staying here while I run Sandy around, so that’ll work just fine.” “You will call, won’t you, Davey?” His mother asked in a worried tone, and Davey got up to hug her tightly. “It’s only for a day or two, Mom.” Davey said softly.“Everything’s going to be fine. The doc’s going to do this surgery and you’re going to feel better than you have in years.” “I hope so.” She said softly, all the edge of anger gone from her voice as they hugged.There were tears in my eyes, and I remembered how devoted Davey had been to his mother.Despite the anger that often flared between them, they’d been close, almost as if their bickering and arguing was a glue that bound them together. “I better get some clothes.” Davey said softly, breaking the hug and looking over at me with a hint of a sarcastic smile. “Let me show you my ‘room’, Brian.” “Okay” I said while noticing the look of hurt that went across his grandmother’s face.She gave me a wan smile as I stood up and followed Davey down into the ‘family room’.It was really just a step down from the dining room.A big-screen projection television dominated the far end of the room, and we walked behind the two armchairs and around the couch where a twin bed was stuffed up against the far wall.A stereo sat on a speaker, although the large headphones attested to the fact that music was rarely ever played over the speaker.A dresser stood against the wall, and to the immediate right were the sliding doors that hid the washer and dryer.My heart went out to Davey at the total lack of privacy, since we could hear his mother and grandmother talking in quiet but urgent tones in the dining room. “Welcome to my little corner of paradise.” Davey said softly in a voice that dripped with sarcasm.He pulled out a paper bag from a corner since he’d left his duffel bag at my house, and began to open the drawers of the small dresser and pulled out some clothes.“How much should I pack?” “Enough for today and tomorrow, at least.” I said. “Your uniform’s still at the house.” “That’s right.” He said as he pulled out a couple pairs of frayed underwear, some socks with holes in them, and a pair of jeans and two shirts that had seen better days.He put them in the bag, folded the top over and smiled.“Well, I’m ready.” “Let’s head out.” I said as nicely as I could. The feelings running through me were mixed at best.Part of me felt really bad for him having to live like this, but another part of me remembered the look of hurt in his grandmother’s face and I felt bad for her.",

      "content": "“If he hadn’t done this to Jenny then poor Davey wouldn’t have to live like this.” Monta was saying and I winced slightly. “Oh yes, it’s all his fault.” Davey’s voice dripped sarcasm and anger and I tried to look away so I wouldn’t see the look of hurt on his mother’s face.“It’s not like he was the one who told me we were going on a vacation for a few days when we were really leaving forever and didn’t even give me the chance to say goodbye to my friends.” “David Ray Jones Jr., how dare you say that?” His grandmother fumed. “Your mother did the right thing getting you away from that beast of a man!I should have made her do it years ago when I saw him beat you.” “He didn’t beat me.” Davey shot back angrily and I wondered if there was anything I could say to calm this situation down. It made me decidedly uncomfortable to be stuck like this, torn between the hurt I knew Davey felt and the pain I saw in the eyes of the two women.There was nothing I needed to do, though, as the sound of a baby crying came from the back of the house. “Now look what you’ve done!” Davey’s mother complained as Monta got up and hurried back into the house, muttering about Davey waking up the baby. “Then maybe it’s good I’ll be gone until tomorrow at least.” Davey said sourly.His face did soften as his mother looked hurt, though.“I love you, Mom.” “I love you too, Davey.” His mother said softly and the look of hurt faded a bit from her face. “It was nice to meet you, ma’am.” I said softly, and she returned my smile briefly before nodding. “Let’s get going.” Davey said in a voice that was so conflicted with emotion that I couldn’t quite place all of them. I followed him out of the house and we got into the car before I drove off, heading back up to Modesto. He was silent and brooding again, but now it was about things other than his car. As much as I wanted to comfort him, I also knew that a part of the problem was more than his family’s actions towards him, but his reactions to the situation they were in, and I would have to think about that.Anyone in his situation would be torn and conflicted, as he obviously was, and I wondered how best to help him.Well, being a good friend was always a good start to any situation like this, and I would always be the best friend any Davey Jones could ask for in life. Chapter 8 While Davey and I spent most of the afternoon working on our history project, Mom and Dad spent the time cleaning out the guest bedroom. The Davey I had known had a hundred years or more of life experiences behind his argumentation skills, but this Davey was just seventeen and showed the diamond in the rough that would become his debating skills later in life. He had some good theories, and we spent most of the time hashing them out. When they paused for lunch, my parents seemed to enjoy listening to Davey and I argue about different ideas for our project. While the discussion grew a little heated at times, Davey seemed happier than he’d been in a while as he focused on something besides the troubles in his life. I understood it was a respite for him, and I wanted to make the most of it for him. “Boys, why don’t you take a break?” My father suggested as we approached dinner time. It was starting to get dark outside and I hadn’t realized so much time had passed. “Brenda and I were thinking of having an adult’s night out, going out to dinner and a movie. Would you like to tag along or do your own thing?” “Has there been any word on my car?” Davey asked with a touch of nervousness. “None since earlier this afternoon.” Dad answered. “They said then it might take a few days to get the parts they needed. I hoped you don’t mind, but Janice came out for a smoke before the tow-truck left and she mentioned to me that you aren’t scheduled for work on Monday or Tuesday.” “That’s right.” Davey said with a frown. “I don’t mind taking you around town and I won’t miss practice since you don’t have to work.” I spoke up immediately and my dad smiled at me. “If you want to make things easier and stay here, the guest room is ready for you.” Dad suggested calmly. “I know it’ll make things easier for Brian, and I imagine with how crowded your grandparents’ house sounds, it won’t be a bad thing for them either.” “I’ll call mom and ask.” Davey said softly. “I’m worried about her; she didn’t look that good this morning.” “She’s going to be fine, Davey.” Dad said reassuringly, and I was surprised to see how Davey’s shoulders slumped in relief a bit. His reaction to my father was different than his reaction to the adults in his family, and I wondered how much the whole mess with his own father was a part of their angry interactions with each other. “Give her a call though. Right now she needs to worry about her own health first and foremost. Let her know you’re doing fine and it’ll help.” “If you say so, Mr. B.” Davey said softly and got up to go use the phone. Dad looked over at me with a look of concern on his face. I’d had a few moments earlier in the day to tell him about what I’d seen at Davey’s ‘home’ during our visit this morning. Davey had been in the bathroom, and that had given me just enough time to share the highlights with Dad. My father had been shocked hearing my description of Davey’s ‘bed’ and while we both knew it was better than being on the street, the total lack of privacy Davey had to live with was shocking to us. “Order a pizza if you guys stay in, okay?” Dad asked and I nodded. “Thank you for doing all this dad.” I said quietly. “I know it’s not like he’s been a family friend for a while or anything, but I really appreciate how much you’re helping him out.” “He’s a good guy.” Dad said softly. “I’d only hope that if you ever were in a situation like his that someone else would do what we’re doing for you. It sounds like his family has a lot of issues to work through, and while they are doing that, they can’t really pay him the attention he needs. We can, and we will.” “Thanks.” I said again and he nodded before heading out to go talk with Mom. Davey came back a moment later with a frown on his face. “What’s wrong?” I asked him and he sighed. “Just Mom being a mom.” He answered cryptically and I let it go at that. “I’m tired of working on the project. How about we do something else?” “I could use a run.” I said and he frowned. “You making another reference to my stomach?” He said defensively and I realized I should have said something else with him already feeling defensive from his conversation with his mother. “No.” I said with a shrug. “I just know that when I’m feeling uptight I like to work out. It helps me, so I thought it might help you.” “It’s better than having a cigarette, I guess.” He said with a shrug and I grimaced. “Yeah, it is.” I agreed with him. “I didn’t bring any running clothes.” He said and I stood up to lead the way to my bedroom. “Don’t worry, we’re the same shoe size and I have an old pair of running shoes and some sweats you can wear.” I assured him. “Jeez, it’s like you’re trying to make me dress all preppy like you.” He said, but there was a hint of humor in his voice. “Well, we’ve got to have you looking your best if you’re going to be my best friend.” I said as we entered my bedroom and I realized he’d stopped in the doorway, looking at me hard. “I thought you already had a best friend.” He said softly, but there was a glistening look in his eyes that sent chills down my spine. “They seem to be more interested in kissing Marcie’s ass instead of being friends with me.” I said with a shrug. “You’re not going to do that, are you? I mean even if she slashes your tires again?” “She can blow up my car and I won’t walk away.” Davey said softly with gleaming eyes locked on mine. “You and your family are the best thing to happen to me in a long time.” “Good, we feel the same way about you.” I said. “Why?” Davey asked and I smiled gently. “You just told me why.” I replied. “You said she could blow up your car, and dude, I know how important a car is to a guy our age, and she wouldn’t be able to keep you from being my friend. Her and I break up, and I find out who my true friends are, and you’re here. That means a lot to me, you know.” “It means a lot what your folks are doing for me, too.” Davey reiterated and I nodded. “So, now we know another part of why we’re friends and you don’t have to doubt why you’re welcome here.” I said with a shrug. “Now let’s get ready for a run.” “Okay.” Davey said with a bit of a grin on his face. We got dressed, and I couldn’t help notice the sly looks he was giving me. I posed when I noticed the looks, and wondered if he realized that I was posing, but didn’t care. Our friendship was developing just fine, and as much as my body was crying for more as I put on my jock, I knew that it would come eventually. He didn’t have his own jock, and for a moment I considered offering one of my spares, but realized that would probably be a little too awkward just now. The only problem with just having the idea though was that I was fully hard at the thought, and suddenly didn’t want him noticing that. I finished getting dressed in a pair of blue Downey sweats and a black t-shirt while he wore a pair of my old blue sweats from freshman year and a yellow t-shirt. “Let’s stretch.” I said when we were dressed and he had finished putting on a pair of my old running shoes. He let out a little sigh at the comfort of them and I felt guilty again at how threadbare his wardrobe was. Come to think of it, the nicest clothes I’d seen him in lately had been those my mother had bought him as a belated birthday gift. A half-mile into the run, he was wheezing something bad, and I was astonished at how out of shape he was. The Davey I’d known would have set double the pace and not even broken into a sweat for the first mile at this age. How much had he been smoking? “Oh god, it’s been so long since I went for a run.” Davey moaned as we slowed to a fast walk and he tried to catch his breath. “How long has it been?” I asked him. “Over a year, since we moved from Nevada.” Davey explained. “That’s bad.” I said with a frown and he nodded. “Let’s pick up the pace.” He said in a determined tone that was very familiar, and very welcome. He had a half-smile on his face as we started jogging, albeit slower than before. “I use to run a lot back in Nevada.” Davey said with a slight wheeze after another half-mile. He was sweating profusely now, but he seemed determined to go on for at least a little more. “I use to do a lot of things in Nevada, for that matter.” “Why’d you stop?” I asked and he shrugged as we finished another half mile and he motioned for us to turn back. Three miles wasn’t exactly a lot, but for his first time out in a year, it was pretty damn good. “A lot of reasons.” Davey wheezed after we’d gone for a bit in silence. I slowed to a walk, and he followed my change of pace, lifting his arms over his head and stretching out while taking deep, steady breaths. We kept moving though, although the pace was just a rapid walk. “Part of it was just being depressed over the whole sack of shit that my life became.” “What happened?” I asked cautiously, not sure if he’d want to share. “I mean, I know what the papers said, but what happened really, for you?” “It sucked.” Davey answered bitterly. “Mom had been sick for a couple weeks with pneumonia and Nanny had come out to Nevada with Papa to care for her. Nanny now thinks Dad had been poisoning Mom, but I don’t really believe that at all. Anyway, Mom got better and the Saturday before Thanksgiving Mom asked me if I wanted to go with them to California for the holiday. I agreed since we weren’t playing any games at school and it was boring stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Dad was the only one who stayed behind. After Thanksgiving, I started asking when we were going back to Nevada, but Mom kept on putting me off saying she wasn’t feeling well.” “That’s not right.” I said, and while I’d heard parts of the story before, I’d never heard it like this or with the anger and venom in his voice. It also explained some facets of Davey’s psyche that I had never really understood before. “No, it wasn’t.” Davey agreed bitterly and picked the pace back up to a slow jog. “It was December before I learned we weren’t going back to Nevada. At first I threw a fit and demanded that if Mom wanted to divorce Dad, that was fine, but I wanted to live in Nevada.” “She didn’t tell you why?” I asked and he shook his head. “Not until they’d already enrolled me at Ceres High just in time for finals that I had no chance to prepare for.” Davey explained. “I got lucky and did alright and with the grades I’d already gotten in Eureka I eked out B’s in most of my classes, but I’d been getting a 3.8 GPA in Nevada, so all B’s kind of fucked me up there. I got real mad one night and told Mom she could either buy me a bus ticket back to Nevada or she could tell me what was really going on, and so she broke down and told me the truth about what Dad had done to Jenny.” “That must have been rough.” I said softly. “I didn’t believe her at first.” Davey said so softly I almost didn’t hear him, and he stopped jogging to turn and face me. There were tears in his eyes again. “How awful was that, my sister gets fucking raped by my own father and I didn’t fucking believe it when Mom told me! I was so fucking angry and so god-damn self-centered that all I cared about was getting back to Nevada and my fucking friends there. When Mom told me, I lost it, accusing her of lying just to keep me from siding with Dad against her. We were sitting in Nanny and Papa’s bedroom, with the door shut although I could hear Nanny hovering outside. Mom picked up the phone and called Dad right then and there, and put me on the phone without saying a word.” “Oh god.” I said fiercely, not believing the details I was hearing. Davey had never shared them with me before, and I wondered if that had been on purpose because of how painful they had been, or unintentional because they no longer hurt so much. Here, in this timeline, Davey’s eyes were leaking tears and his cheeks were flushed from more than our run. “I asked him right out, expecting to hear him deny it so that I could go back home to Nevada where I belonged.” Davey’s shoulders shook with sobs, but his body language was so angry and defensive I knew he didn’t want a hug or comfort. He wanted somebody to listen. Hearing this was so amazing for me, because it hadn’t been something I’d ever discussed with my Davey in detail, and it was like a door was opening to understanding the man I’d loved for decades. “My whole fucking world came crashing down on that phone call. When I told him what mother claimed, I waited for him to tell me it was all a lie. I was so ready to believe that, but he didn’t. All he did was start crying. My fucking father, who I could never remember crying like that, fucking broke down in sobs on the phone and told me how sorry he was. “FUCK YOU DAD!” Davey yelled into the darkening twilight and I shook with my own unshed tears for him. “How the fuck could he do that to her? But you know what’s the worst thing about it all? It’s not just what my fucking father did to my sister, it’s what my mother did to me! Her and my grandparents, and my sister, and everyone around me. Even Shantill, that fucking nitwit, knew what had happened, but could anyone even fucking tell me? No, they fucking lied to me and put me off like I couldn’t handle the truth! You wonder why I’m so mad at them? I saw the look on your face at Nanny’s, you know. That’s why I’m so fucking mad at them. They couldn’t even fucking tell me the goddamn truth about what my father had done to my sister! I had to force them to tell me!” “They were all wrong.” I said softly and he looked at me with fury and passion burning in his eyes. We were jogging along a canal path, empty at this time of year, and the only lights were from the stars, the rising moon, and cars in the distance. While our eyes remained locked on each other, I stepped towards him, and put my hands on his shoulders as my teary eyes bored into his. “They didn’t respect you, but what are you doing now? You’re working, giving them a lot of your hard-earned money to help, why?” “Because they’re my family and I care.” Davey said with an exhaled breath. “How could I turn my back on my sister after what she’s been through? My mother too. I know she didn’t do right by me, but I know why she did it. It hurt, and she was afraid I’d still go back to him even knowing the truth. It hurts she didn’t trust me, but she’s still my mother and I know she loves me.” “You’re a good guy, Davey Jones.” I said softly and he blushed slightly. “No, don’t be embarrassed. I don’t know many guys would go through what you’ve been through and still care a bit about his family.” “I’m not all that good.” Davey said softly as he looked at the cars in the distance. It was getting chilly out, and the fact that we’d been sweating didn’t help, but neither of us wanted to move at this moment. “You want to know another reason why Papa doesn’t let me in after eleven-thirty? It’s because last year at Ceres I got mixed up with stoners. I’d stay out late with them getting drunk and stoned. It felt good to let go, to forget my problems and drift along all numb to the pain. That’s why they really helped me get into Downey, to get me away from those guys, but it didn’t really work. Most of the money I have left over I spend getting pot for them and me and alcohol for Ronna or Jeannette when I can’t hang around the stoners. So you see, I’m not really a good guy.” “Bullshit.” I snapped angrily, not just at the fact that he was doing drugs and drinking like mad at times. His eyes snapped back to me at the word, and I locked gazes with him. “Good people can make bad decisions without becoming bad themselves.” “Tell it to Mrs. Dent.” He said and I almost lost the reference until I remembered the junior high math teacher who taught positive/negative multiplication with a silly reference to bad things happening to good people being a bad thing, and bad things happening to bad people being a good thing. “Real life is more complicated than that.” I reminded him and he looked at me as if he was longing to hear the next words out of my mouth. “I know it hurts, Davey.” “How could you?” Davey asked angrily as he pulled away from me and crossed his arms to stare at me in his anger. “You’ve got the perfect fucking family, Brian. Your parents, most people would kill to have parents like them. God knows I would sell my soul for parents like them, so what the fuck could you know about hurting?” “I had a favorite uncle.” I said slowly, trying to mix the truth with the reality of this timeline without outright lying to Davey. Building a relationship on a foundation of lies was a bad thing, or should I just tell him the full truth right now? Was he ready for that? “Uncle Rich and I use to do a lot of things together and he was like this god-figure when I was younger. He could do no wrong, and I loved talking to him on the phone, and visiting him.” “Let me guess, he died in an accident or something?” Davey sneered and for a moment I felt really angry at him. “He died of AIDS back in 1981, just after Christmas.” I said softly, and truthfully. Davey’s face contorted in a mix of emotions before he frowned at me. “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “Did he get it through a blood transfusion?” “No, he caught it because his partner liked to sleep around.” I said bitterly and he frowned before his eyes widened. “Don’t you dare say something about ‘fags’ or ‘queers’ either, Davey Jones. He was my uncle and I loved him. He should fucking be alive right now!” “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “That’s not all.” I said fiercely, wanting to make sure he did realize that I could understand hurt and loss. “Every Thanksgiving we usually go see my grandparents back east. This last time, the fucking bitch Marcie decided to have me spend time with her family and like an idiot, I agreed. My grandparents decided to come out here and they fucking died in a car accident on the I-5 in heavy fog, all because I listened to my bitch of a girlfriend.” “Shit.” Davey said and this time he stepped closer to me, and I could feel his hands on my arms as more tears came to my eyes. Yes, it hadn’t been me exactly who had done that, made those decisions, or had watched Uncle Rich die, but in many ways it really had been me and if the choices I had made had not created this timeline, they’d have never happened. Someday I’d tell him that part of all this. “Yeah, shit.” I said bitterly. “So, you know, Davey Jones, my little life isn’t perfect after all. Yes I’ve got damn fucking good parents, but that doesn’t guarantee me a perfect little life.” “I’m sorry.” He said softly. “I got so wrapped up in me that…” “Yeah, well, let’s head home.” I said, turning to wrap my arm around his shoulder and he sagged against me as we began walking back to the house. We walked in silence, but it was a good silence. When we were getting closer to the house, I dropped my arm and we walked next to each other. “Your uncle, your parents knew he was…gay and still let you around him?” Davey asked as we got near the house, and part of me cheered that he’d brought up the first conversation between us about gay people. That was something I knew we’d have to work on if there was to be more between us than friendship or just sex. “Yeah, they know gay people aren’t like some pervert or something.” I said with a shrug. “My uncle was just a man who happened to like other men. That didn’t mean he was going to go all pervo on me.” “No, that’s something people like my father do.” Davey said bitterly and I felt guilty for a moment. “No, don’t say you’re sorry, Brian, it’s just… I’ve never thought about it like that before. My father would have a shit-fit if he thought about me being around someone like that. Hell for that matter so would the rest of my family.” “What do you think about it?” I asked him and he gave me a long look. “You obviously aren’t freaked out about people like that.” Davey said softly. “No, I’m not.” I said with a shrug. “It’s a fact of life, either you are that way or you’re not. It’s just, with Uncle Rich, it was a part of who he was, but it wasn’t all of who he was. You know what I mean?” “I think so.” Davey said with a frown as we walked up the driveway and into the house. Mom and Dad were already gone and Davey looked at me as we stood in the entryway of the house. He wanted to say something, but he hesitated. “Don’t get this the wrong way, but what if like, oh yeah, maybe like what if you had a brother and he turned out to be… gay? How would your parents react?” “Dude, my parents told me when I was twelve that if I liked boys instead of girls they were fine with that as long as I loved them and treated them right.” I said with a laugh. “Oh.” Davey said with wide eyes and shake of his head. “I’m going to take a shower, okay?” “Okay.” I said. “I’ll order the pizza?” “Uh, sure.” Davey said. “How’s pepperoni and sausage?” I asked. “Sounds good.” He said and headed off into the bathroom. I found I was humming to myself as I looked up the pizza company in the yellow pages. It was an old song for me, but a song that hadn’t come out until well after 2010. While trying to find the pizza company I liked, I realized how much I missed things like the internet and instant access to information. There were other things I missed too, like On the Border restaurants and big bookstores, but so far, there was one thing I didn’t miss. He was in my bathroom taking a shower right now. That evening we ate pizza, played chess, and talked. We weren’t interested in going out for anything, so we stayed in and we talked. Davey talked about Nevada, and the things he’d done there, and I could hear in his voice how much he missed playing football. It was obvious that he hadn’t gone out for the football team at Downey last September because he was afraid of failing to make the team as much as because he needed to work. It wasn’t all him talking though, and I found myself walking a fine line between my memories of my original timeline and the experiences of this timeline’s Brian. It wasn’t easy, but by the time midnight rolled around, we were both ready for bed, and I felt like we’d made a lot of progress in getting to know each other. “Thanks for everything.” Davey said quietly before rushing in to give me a hug when we were heading towards the bedroom. I returned the hug, and he blushed before heading into the guest bedroom. Part of me wanted to invite him to spend the night in my room again, but there was a look in his eyes that told me he liked the idea of staying in a room by himself. Mom and Dad returned sometime after midnight, and I woke up just enough to realize it was them coming home before rolling over and going back to sleep. I was up a little after seven in the morning, and I was slightly surprised to see Davey up as well. He’d told me how he liked to sleep in on weekends, and in that he wasn’t that different than the Davey I had known. “You going running this morning?” Davey asked me softly since my parents were still asleep. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt since it was slightly chilly, and he probably mistook that for meaning I was going running. There was a look in his eyes like he wanted the answer to be yes, so I changed my plan of fixing a bowl of cereal into a plan for going running. “Sure, you want to join me?” I asked him and he smiled. “I’m not sure if I want to, but I know I should.” He said with a low chuckle. “Last night proved that I need to exercise more.” “Cool, let me get you a sweatshirt.” I said as I turned to go back in my room. He was wearing the sweatpants from last night, so he was fine there, and I saw he had my old pair of running shoes on as well. “Dude, I’m borrowing so many of your clothes it’s like a good thing we’re so close in size.” He said and I chuckled. “Anytime you want to borrow something of mine, you just take it.” I told him and he blushed slightly as I threw him a green sweatshirt and he pulled it on over his head. “I don’t think I’ve ever known someone close enough to my sizes to share clothes like this.” Davey said. “It’s kind of weird.” “It’s kind of cool.” I responded. “I’ve never really known someone my size either. Brandon’s close to my height, but he’s skinny as a reed.” “Yeah, he is.” Davey agreed with a hint of sourness. We stretched without too much chatter, and this morning I let him set the pace. It started off slow, but he picked it up as we finished the three-mile run, and while he was breathing heavily, he was also smiling broadly. The adult part of me knew it was because he’d set a goal and completed it successfully. Davey liked achieving goals in his life, but he usually set them so high there was no way he could achieve them, and that failure would make him feel depressed. During the morning, my father drafted the two of us to help him clean up a lot of the clutter they’d cleared out of the guest bedroom, and to help him rearrange the stuff in the garage. After a bunch of talk, my weight equipment was moved to the back patio to make room for more of mom’s stuff in the garage. Being included in the task of helping move things relaxed Davey as he felt like he was helping to ‘work off’ what he felt he owed my father. After lunch I dropped him off at work before returning home. It was time for the third degree of questioning from both Dad and Mom as they wanted to know everything they could get out of me about Davey. They both liked him a lot, and the more I shared, the more they grew to look worried about him, and at the same time a bit hopeful. “I wish we could adopt him.” Mom said softly before looking at me. “You wouldn’t mind that, would you Brian?” “He’s got his own family, even if they’re all messed up right now.” Dad reminded her. “It’s more like he just needs a safe place to be himself. We can do that, certainly. Plus, I’ll drop by the apartment in S.F. when his mom’s having surgery. I’ll be able to chat with his grandmother then and get more perspective on everything. From what you said, Brian, she at least understands some of how this might be hard on David and want to help in any way she can. Plus, I’ll probably see Pete in the bank and we can talk about that fishing trip. I wasn’t sure what to think about him, but you seem certain he’s got David’s best interests at heart.” “He’s reacting the only way he really knows how, trying to keep Davey out of trouble.” I hadn’t flat out told them about Davey’s admission of drug use, but they’d taken the hints. Drugs was something guaranteed to get them upset, but at the same time, they were also smart enough to know that if Davey was willing to tell me about it, he was willing to at least listen to someone talking to him about stopping it. “What’s the real story with his car?” I asked dad, who frowned at me. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, dad, I know it won’t take a few days for the starter to come in.” I said and he smiled with a shake of his head. “I should have known you’d have figured that out.” He replied. “I’m having that front fender fixed from where it was all bent up. Do you know how that happened?” “Yeah, he was following someone too closely and reacted too late when they stopped in front of him.” I answered. “It was late and he’d been working a couple of shifts at a couple of restaurants.” “He works too hard for minimum wage.” Dad said. “I know he actually makes about a dollar above minimum wage.” I said with a shrug. “That’s still too little for working so much.” Mom frowned as she spoke her mind. “Can’t he get a better job?” “It was the first job he got offered.” I said with a shrug, having put together a couple of pieces of that story from our conversation last night. “I think he’s really scared of rejection, and he took the first thing that came along so he wouldn’t have to face rejection from somewhere else, and that’s why he’s not really interested in looking for other work.” “Does he have any other skills?” Mom asked with concern. “Do you know if he can type or anything like that?” “Yeah, he can type.” I answered. “He told me he took typing classes in Nevada and at Ceres High and passed the proficiency test with a typing speed of forty-five words per minute. They also taught filing and stuff like that.” “Then why doesn’t he try to get a job in an office?” Mom asked. “Probably because most of those types of jobs are during the day, not evenings and weekends like fast food.” Dad answered. “He might make more per hour doing that work, but he won’t have as many hours and that means he’ll make less overall.” “I hadn’t thought about that.” Mom stated. “I just want to thank you both for being so nice to him.” I said quietly and Dad shook his head while Mom smiled. “We’ve been lucky with you, overall, Brian.” Dad said. “Actually, we’ve been lucky all our lives, and I don’t think I could live with myself if we didn’t help someone like David when the situation presented itself to us.” “I guess we’re just old-fashioned liberals at heart.” Mom said with a fond smile for Dad, and I tried not to imagine where the smile might lead. After Davey got off work, he and I went out to dinner at a Lyon’s restaurant before I took him back to his grandmother’s. He was happier than I’d seen him in a while, and spent most of dinner telling me about some crazy customers that had come through his restaurant that day. It was an enjoyable evening, and I was sorry he was going back home, but I could also see the worried look in his eyes when he mentioned his mother. Monta insisted that I come in when she saw us pull up. She was outside with her great-granddaughter, Whitney, who was now just over a year old. Shantill was apparently out on a date, but Jenny was there, as was Davey’s mother. Jenny was far different than the girl I’d known in the last timeline. She was a little plumper, and lacked the drive and determination that had led her to being a fighter pilot and eventually the commanding general of an entire Air Force base. She’d retired after being the first female general to sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and very nearly being the first female Chair of that important military agency. That didn’t mean she wasn’t lively and interesting, just that it was in a far different way. She was more interested in gossip and what I’d call ‘girlie’ things than in flying or military life, and she definitely expressed an interest in me that made me uncomfortable on several levels. Davey just rolled his eyes at her a couple of times while we all chatted for about an hour. When I got home, I was surprised to see Trevor’s truck outside, and him waiting inside for me. “Trevor stopped by about an hour ago to see you.” Mom said by way of introduction as I came in and I looked at my friend with a little trepidation. Why was he here? “How about we go out back?” Trevor asked and I nodded in agreement before leading the way out into the back yard. He stood there, hands in his pockets and looked around for a bit before speaking. “You moved your weights out here.” “Yes, now what do you want?” I said sharply, more sharply than I intended and he winced slightly. “Dude, can’t I just come by and say hi to my friend?” Trevor asked defensively. “We’ve been friends forever, dude, and you gotta know I miss you.” “Yeah, well I figured you decided your girlfriend’s more important.” I said with a shrug. “Dude, don’t go there.” He said angrily. “What about your little boyfriend?” “He’s just my friend.” I said quickly. “According to Marcie she saw you guys together Friday night.” Trevor said with a leer and I felt my temper rise. “Yeah that was just before she started giving Mark Spencer a blow job in his car.” I sneered and he looked at me with wide eyes. “So that’s why he did it.” Trevor whispered. “Did what?” I asked, knowing what he probably meant. “He’s the one who slashed Jones’s tires for her.” Trevor said. “That’s why I came by here, to tell you that.” “Why?” I asked. “She was pissed when she saw you hanging out around him.” Trevor said softly. “Marcie thinks that if she can keep anyone from hanging out around you that you’ll beg her to take you back and so she’s sending a message to anyone who’d be your friend.” “Thanks, but that’s not what I meant.” I replied. “I already figured that part out, what I meant was why are you here telling me all this?” “We’ve been friends for years, Brian.” Trevor said softly, not meeting my eyes but looking out over the back yard. “I’m starting to think no girl’s worth destroying our friendship over.” “It’d have been nice for you to figure that out earlier.” I said angrily and instantly regretted those words. “I’m sorry, Trevor, that wasn’t fair. I’ve been as bad a friend over the past year from what it sounds like. You know, we use to have a better idea about what was important in life.” “Yeah, we did until we started really dating.” Trevor said with a sigh. “Is that what the future holds? We meet some girl, marry her and lose all of our old friends?” “It doesn’t have to be that way.” I said from the experience of actually having lived a life where I kept in touch with my old friends. We’d all been there, together, that day that the plane had slammed into the Pentagon despite Davey’s efforts, and we’d all been in the same room together when the last American troops left Iraq in 2007, and when war had broken out in 2009 following the assassination of the Iraqi Prime Minister, we’d all watched as Congress voted to send our troops back over there, and we’d all joined Trevor in celebrating his Super Bowl victory in 2011. “I don’t want it that way.” Trevor said after a long moment of quiet thinking. He turned back to look me in the eyes before holding out his hand. “Friends again?” “Always.” I said, taking his hand and shaking it firmly. “So how’s David doing with his car?” Trevor asked in a much easier tone and I relaxed as I told him how my father was fixing the car up. He shook his head, and we talked in earnest for several hours out there on the porch. It was a good beginning. Chapter 9 Monday morning I picked Davey up early, before anyone else in his grandmother’s house was even awake, and we ran around the track at the school. By the time we were done, the gym was opened and Coach Cole nodded at us as we came in for a shower. Davey was exhausted, but once again completing the run had left him in a good mood. We hit the cafeteria for breakfast, and I noticed him choosing much the same food that I did, staying away from the high cholesterol, greasy stuff that he might have normally eaten. Since he didn’t have to work that afternoon, he stayed around school while I went to baseball practice. I could see him sitting there on the bleachers, sneaking looks at the guys on the team in their practice gear, and smiled to myself since I was the recipient of most of those looks. Mark Spencer was spending most of the practice ignoring me until sliding practice where he tried to swipe my leg with his cleats. Coach Anders spotted his attempt and sent him running laps for the rest of practice with a threat that if he did it again, he’d be suspended from the team for a week. “Yo, Breckenridge, I hear that Jones guy over there is bobbing your knob now.” Adam Mitchell, another junior on the team who also played football said to me in a low voice as we stood near the dugout while the sliding drills continued. “If he was, it’d be better than that bitch Marcie.” I said forcefully and Mitchell burst out in laughter, nearly doubling over. “Yo, Jones, why don’t you do something useful instead of sitting there?” Coach Anders called out to Davey a few minutes later and Davey looked up with curiosity. “Get over here.” Davey complied, getting up and putting away the book he’d been reading. Anders gave him the clipboard he’d been making notes on and then had Davey following him around, scribing notes on the clipboard about the performance of different members of the team. That left a smile on my face, and I wondered again at how the staff at a school with over two thousand students still found time to do little things like Anders was doing. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, Spencer?” Anders’s voice boomed out near the end of practice and I looked up from where I’d just slid into second base before the tag to see Spencer caught red-handed rifling through Davey’s backpack. Davey had left it on the bleachers where he’d been sitting, and Spencer was halfway through tearing some pages out of the book Davey had been reading. Davey stood next to the coach with a look of anger on his face. “I…uh…” Spencer stammered but the Coach cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Get your stupid ass into my office and wait for me there.” Anders growled. “Everyone, twenty laps and practice is over. Jones, make sure they all complete their laps and then help Riley get the equipment put up before meeting me in my office. I want to talk to you too.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said weakly, glaring at Spencer. “Oh, and make sure nothing’s missing from your backpack and give me the details of anything Spencer damaged.” Anders ordered before walking away, following the path a sullen Mark Spencer was taking to the gym and the coach’s office. I gave Davey a sympathetic look that he shrugged off before joining the team to make the laps. “That was plain wrong.” Adam Mitchell said as he jogged near me. Trevor was further back in the bunch, and Brandon was lagging behind all of us when several people made a point of speeding up to keep from being beside him. It seemed the team knew damn well where the battle lines were being drawn between Marcie and I, and while people didn’t exactly flock around me, they knew Brandon was on ‘her’ side right now and were shunning him. The few times I glimpsed his face, it looked like he was deep in thought. “Which part?” I asked Adam after staying quiet for a moment. His statement could have gone both ways. “Spencer going through his backpack.” Adam said softly. “I heard your ex-girlfriend bragging at lunch about how Spencer slashed that Jones guy’s tires over the weekend and now this. She’s fucking wacko. Dude, you know I was just teasing you about the fag shit, right? I mean, no one really believes the shit she’s talking about. Most people know she’s pissed you dumped her ass for being a slut and she’s just trying to get back at you.” “Don’t worry about it, dude.” I said with a shrug. “So, Jones, he’s a pretty cool guy?” Adam asked a lap later. Trevor and a few other teammates were now running with us. “We knew him in junior high at La Loma.” Trevor answered before I could say anything. “He’s a bit geeky but not bad. He played on the freshman team before he moved to Nevada.” “I heard his dad’s a pervert.” Rich, another of our teammates said derisively. “It was in the papers how his old man was porkin’ Jones’s sister.” “Don’t even fucking joke about that shit.” Tim, another of our teammates said with a disgusted sound in his voice. “Imagine if that was your sister.” “I don’t have a sister.” Rich said defensively. “You do have a brother, don’t you?” Tim shot back. “Don’t fucking even suggest that shit.” Rich’s voice filled with anger. “Now imagine what it must be like for Jones.” I said softly, gathering everyone’s attention, and after another lap that passed by in silence, Rich spoke up again. “How does he stand it?” Rich asked quietly. “Do you think Jones will help Riley and Coach out for the season?” Tim asked me in the silence that followed Rich’s comment. “Probably not.” I said with a shake of my head. “He works a lot you know. I’m giving him a ride for now until his car’s fixed and he was only here today because he had the day off. His mom and sister need the money bad. His mom, she’s getting ready for a major surgery in a week or two, and his sister’s going to therapy that he has to pay for since no one else can.” “Dude, he pays for all that shit?” Rich asked with surprise. “Why don’t someone else pay, like his father or the state?” “Who’d hire his father after he was in the news so much?” I snorted. “His mother can’t work, at least until after the surgery because of her back and the state’s dicking her around on disability. Someone has to pay for that stuff, and so he works his ass off.” “Dude, that’s so unfair.” Tim said quietly. “Fuck, how’s he paying to fix his car with all those bills?” “Dad’s paying for it.” I said with a shrug. “He’s lucky to have you for a friend.” Trevor said with a hint of bitterness in his voice. I guessed the bitterness was for his having taken Marcie’s side of everything at first. “More like I’m lucky to have him for a friend.” I replied. “Why’s that?” Rich asked quietly. “He likes to play sports.” I said quietly. “At his last school he played football, basketball, track, just about every sport they offered, and he was on the debate team and a whole bunch of other stuff. The guy’s smart, and he’s had to give all that up so he can earn enough money to pay his sister’s psychologist’s bills. How many of us would give up everything we wanted to help our family out? That’s loyalty, and he gives the same loyalty to friends, too.” “Oh.” Rich said, and we finished the rest of our laps in relative silence. Davey was already inside the gym as I entered with the rest of the team. There was no sign of Mark Spencer, but Davey was in with Coach Anders while I got undressed and showered. By the time I was clean and dressed in my street clothes, there was another commotion and we all turned to see Coach Cole leading a red-faced Mark Spencer into the gym. He had Spencer’s right arm bent behind his back and had the angriest look on his face I’d ever seen before. “Breckenridge, get in the office now!” Cole roared and I jumped to obey, stuffing my dirty practice uniform into my bag before leaving the bag on the bench and double-timing to the office. “What’s he done now?” Coach Anders asked as I entered the office and shut the door behind me. The rest of the team was trying to hear what was going on without looking like it, but Cole crossed the room to close the blinds. He’d dumped Mark into one of the chairs where Mark was glowering at Davey and I in turn. Davey’s shoulders were hunched up, and he was looking at the floor. “I found him taking a key to Breckenridge’s car.” Cole growled angrily before looking at me. “Sorry, Breckenridge, you’ve got a couple of good scratches that are going to require the car to be repainted probably.” “You son of a bitch.” I growled, turning angrily to Spencer. “Watch your language, Breckenridge.” Coach Anders growled at me. “That’s five laps you owe me tomorrow before practice.” “Yes, coach.” I said, turning my anger down to a hard simmer. “Spencer, what part of me sending you to the Principal as punishment for what you’d already done didn’t you understand?” Coach Anders asked of Spencer who just shrugged his shoulders while staring at his hand. “Do you understand what has to happen now?” “Borsch already suspended me for two days and I have to pay that faggot back for the stupid book.” Spencer said sullenly. “You can count on another trip to Principal’s office for that.” Anders growled. “What, you give Breckenridge a couple of laps and send me to the Principal?” Spencer sneered. “That’s really fair.” “Breckenridge is on the team, you’re not.” Anders said sternly. “What?” Spencer’s voice almost cracked in his surprise. “Since when?” “Since Coach Cole found you keying Breckenridge’s car.” Anders retorted. “I won’t have a vandal on my team.” “That’s fucking great.” Spencer murmured, glaring daggers at Davey and then at me. “You’ll pay for this, both of you.” “Actually, it’s you who’ll pay.” Cole said angrily. “We’ll be calling the police here in a few minutes for them to come and take our statements and photograph the evidence of what you did. Breckenridge here is going to press charges, so there’ll be criminal charges, and you’ll have to pay for the damage you caused.” “Like fucking hell I will.” Spencer growled. “I’ll pay for slashing the fag’s tires before I’ll pay for Breckenridge’s car.” “What?” Anders growled with wide eyes as he sat up a bit straighter. Spencer realized he’d said too much, and kept his mouth shut. “What’s he talking about, Jones?” “The tires were slashed on my car over the weekend, Coach.” Davey explained in a voice that was tightly controlled. He was glaring at Spencer and flexing his hands like he wanted to hit the guy. “We were pretty sure it was him who did it, and a couple of people have told me they heard Marcie bragging about him doing it, but you know, that’s all hearsay. Now he’s admitted it front of me. Can you please call the cops? I want to file charges for that too.” “We all heard him, Jones.” Cole said sternly. “Brian, you think the shop that’s working on the car threw the tires out?” Davey asked. “We’ll find out.” I assured him and he nodded, and this time it was he who glared daggers at Spencer, who was now looking fairly pale. Most of the team had left by the time that the police finished, and while they weren’t sure if they could get charges to stick over Davey’s tires, they were quite certain they could get a conviction for the keying of my car, even though it was only a misdemeanor vandalism charge, and he’d likely get only a few hours of community service. The important part was that his father was called in by the police, as was my father. No one could reach Davey’s mother, who was in the Bay Area having tests done, but his grandfather showed up, ready to spit nails. The look of shock on Davey’s face as his grandfather took up Davey’s side and threatened Mr. Spencer with lawsuits and the ‘almighty judgment of the Lord God on your worthless son’ was a sight to see, and I think for the first time in a long time, Davey realized his grandfather really did care for him. “Davey, I’ll give you a ride home.” Pete said as we stood outside looking at my car. “Brian, I’m sorry this had to happen to your handsome car.” “I’m just glad we know who did it and he’ll be paying the price for what he did to not only my car but Davey’s car as well.” I said and Pete nodded. “Davey, this one here’s a good guy.” Pete said with a jerk of his thumb towards me. “You keep him close and we’ll see about changing some things around the house.” “Thanks, Mr. Barrow.” I said quietly and he snorted. “Call me Pete, son.” He said as he held out his hand and I shook it firmly. “Now, let’s get a move on, Davey. Mr. Breckenridge, you’ve got a fine son there, and I appreciate all the help you’ve given my grandson. As soon as his car’s fixed, you bring me the bill.” “Thank you.” Dad said with a nod, although the look in his eyes said Pete would be a long time waiting for that bill. “Brian, you want to get your car to a shop and see about an estimate?” “Let’s wait for Davey’s car to get fixed.” I suggested and Dad nodded. “I’ve got to get back to work.” Dad said. “I’ll see you at dinner?” “Yep.” I said and smiled at him as thanks for his support and help. Finding Trevor waiting for me on the front porch of the house wasn’t a surprise, but Brandon being there with him was a surprise. Mom wasn’t home yet, so they’d waited on the porch for me. When they saw me approach, they both stood up, although Brandon had his hands in his pants pockets and didn’t really meet my gaze. “Hey guys.” I said as lightly as I could and Trevor smiled half-heartedly while Brandon scuffed a foot on the sidewalk. I unlocked the door and they followed me into the house were we stood in the living room. “You want something to drink?” “I’m sorry.” Brandon said softly as an answer, and he lifted his head up to meet my eyes, ready to flinch but he didn’t see any anger there. He took a deep breath as he met my gaze and continued. “I haven’t been a good friend. Marcie’s crazy, and she got our girlfriends to give us ultimatums. I should have known better than to cave to her.” “I forgive you.” I said immediately and held out my hand. He sighed with relief and took it quickly. “So does this mean we’re all three single again?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with a grin. “I got a call as soon as I got home demanding to know what I was going to do to help Marcie and Mark get back at you and Davey and I told her it was over.” “I did too.” Brandon said softly. “Dude, there’s something you need to know, too.” “What’s that?” I asked as a little knot of worry filled my gut. “Marcie, she had me follow you and Davey the other day.” Brandon said with a guilty look on his face. “She knows he doesn’t live in the district and she’s thinking of going to Principal Borsch and getting Davey in trouble. That’s what they wanted me to do, go with them and tell him I’ve seen where Davey really lives. She thinks that’ll get him kicked out of school. She had Mark check earlier today. He’s got a friend who works in the attendance office and he got in Davey’s record and figured out that the address on Davey’s record isn’t where he lives.” “You’re serious.” I said with a frown. Marcie had ammunition now, and if she used it, there wasn’t much we could do about that, not without some help at least. “Yeah, I’m sorry I helped her out.” Brandon said. “Tell that to Davey.” I snapped and he winced. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have snapped like that.” “I deserve it.” Brandon said. “What happened with Spencer? I saw what he did to your car, and so did most of the team. A couple of the guys were wanting to hunt him down and beat the shit out of him.” “He’s being taken care of.” I said with a smile, and related the afternoon’s events to them, or at least what they didn’t already know. “Whew, he’s going to be in a world of shit.” Trevor said with a chuckle. “His father ain’t exactly the most understanding of guys.” “You can say that again.” Brandon laughed. “So, tell us the truth, you and Davey?” “We’re good friends, almost as good friends as I was with the two of you.” I said pointedly and they both nodded slowly. “You mean as good friends as we are again.” Trevor countered. “We’ll see.” I replied and they both nodded with acceptance of that. “So, you two are going to look for new girlfriends?” I asked and Brandon shook his head. “You know, I think I’ll stay single for a bit.” Brandon said with a shrug. “I will too, besides there’s always the barn.” Trevor said with a wink towards Brandon who blushed a bit before smiling. I turned away, not really ready to deal with this yet from my friends. How could they flip-flop so easily between denying they ever did anything with guys and then be this open? “Brian, you want to join us?” “Um, no thanks.” I said with a blush and they laughed. “Well, we’ll like see you tomorrow at school, right?” Brandon asked, and I realized they were really going to be going to Trevor’s barn right now! Jesus they were… teenagers. “Yeah, see you guys at school.” I assured them and then I winked. “Don’t have too much fun in that barn.” “We will.” Trevor said before leading the way out. The phone rang before the door had even finished shutting behind them and I went to answer it before the machine picked up the call. The fact that it was a crank call with heavy breathing and threats on the other end didn’t surprise me. The way they hung up when I mentioned that the police were monitoring all calls to the house in light of recent events ended the call rather quickly. There was homework to do, and a list of chores from my mother that kept me busy for most of the afternoon. I even put my practice uniform in the wash and it was almost dry by the time she got home. Apparently she’d already heard about my day from Dad, and wanted to hear more details, which I gave to her as she started dinner. Davey’s upcoming problem with his residence was in the back of my mind, and the obvious solution was something I wanted to approach carefully, so I didn’t tell her about that yet. Over dinner, Dad had more to say about the day’s events, and he informed me that he’d hired an attorney to represent me and Davey both in a civil suit against Spencer’s and Marcie’s parents. He never really expected to see any money out of them, but he wanted the suit on record, because it would be a permanent record against not only their parents but against Marcie and Spencer. “Dad, there’s another problem you should know about as well.” I said calmly after dinner was over and Dad had finished his dialogue about how Marcie and Spencer were being dealt with. “What is it?” Dad asked just as calmly. “Brandon and Trevor came over after I got back today.” I said and Mom smiled. “You guys have made up?” She asked. “Yes.” I answered and she smiled broadly. “I told you it was just a matter of time.” She reminded me. “You were right, but Brandon had some disturbing news.” I continued. “Dad, you see, we know Davey doesn’t live in the district for Downey, but he also didn’t receive a legitimate transfer. A friend of his mother’s who does live in the district has been letting them use her address on Davey’s record.” “Marcie somehow figured this out?” Dad asked. “Yeah, she had Brandon follow us over the weekend.” I said. “So she’s reported it to the District?” Mom asked and I nodded. “If they investigate they’ll figure it out and send Davey back to Ceres.” Dad said shortly. “You know, that is where he should be going to school if he lives there.” “He’s miserable there, dad.” I responded. “He was fairly miserable at Downey too.” Dad replied. “Was being the key word there.” I pointed out and he nodded. “What do you expect me to do about this?” Dad asked me point-blank. “Expect?” I said. “I don’t expect anything, but I was hoping we might be able to help Davey come up with some alternatives to having to switch schools just when things are starting to look up for him here.” “You mean besides the crap Marcie’s pulling?” Mom said scornfully. “I hate to say it, but I don’t know what you ever saw in that girl.” Dad snorted. “I don’t either.” I replied in complete honesty. “Well I think the first thing we should do is call Pete and Davey and maybe get together with them to discuss this.” Dad said. “I agree.” Mom said and I nodded. He got up to leave the room and as soon as he was gone, Mom turned to me. “Brian, have you thought about dating again?” “Nope.” I snorted. “After Marcie, it’s far too early to think about stuff like that.” “Good.” Mom said with a nod of her head that surprised me. “Brian, Pete’s asked us to come by their place.” Dad said as he came back into the room. He was frowning and I got worried. “Davey’s mom was hospitalized by the doctors in San Francisco today. They just found out a little bit ago.” “Oh no.” Mom murmured, and she got up to go get her jacket. “I’m coming as well.” “I’ll get my jacket.” I said as it had gotten chilly outside as soon as the sun had set. The weather reports also called for a light rain tonight. The house was in near-pandemonium when we arrived. Two of Davey’s aunts, Fran and Priscilla were there, as was Davey and his sister, Jenny. Both of them looked really worried, and had food left over on their plates while almost everyone else had finished their food. His cousin Shantill was there, while her mother Fran held Shantill’s daughter in her arms, trying to calm the crying baby. Pete was sitting at the head of the table with a scowl on his face, and he nodded to my father as we entered, and smiled at my mother when Dad introduced her. “Let’s go in the living room.” He said, leading us through the doorway that connected the dining room with the living room. It was paneled in a dark wood, and had an old stereo console that ran the full length of one of the walls. We all sat down in the room, with Pete in one armchair, Davey in another while I sat on the couch with my parents. Pete shut the folding door across the kitchen for more privacy while Fran and Priscilla kept everyone else occupied. When we were all seated, and Priscilla had brought in some glasses of water for us, he spoke again. “I appreciate you folks coming down here like this. Davey’s made some good friends in you and I hate to impose on you any more.” “We’re honored to have Davey as a friend of our son’s.” Dad said. “He’s a fine young man.” “He can be when he puts his mind to the job.” Pete said with a sideways look at Davey who was looking withdrawn. “Monta’s in a fit right now what with Sandy being hospitalized so sudden like.” “Do we know what’s wrong yet?” Dad asked. “All they said was complications from her back.” Pete said sourly. “That girl’s had to deal with too much in her life as it is without this. There’s nothing we can do about that now but pray. Monta said you had a place you were willing to rent to her?” “She insisted on paying rent.” Dad said firmly. “As far as we’re concerned, she’s free to use it anytime without charge.” “We’ll pay for what we use.” Pete said just as firmly. “We do appreciate the use of the place, though. I’m heading up there in a bit to help Monta out. That woman will spend so much time in a tizzy over Sandy that she won’t take care of herself and both of them will end up in the hospital.” “I’ve brought the keys and directions on how to get there from Children’s Hospital.” Dad said, pulling a folded piece of paper and a set of keys from his pocket. He gave them to me and I got up and handed them to Pete. “It’s much appreciated.” Pete said and then he looked over at Davey for a long moment. “Thanks for all the help you’ve been giving me and my family.” Davey said in a way that suggested he’d been told exactly what to say. Despite that, his eyes showed that the sentiment was real. “We’re glad to be of help.” Mom said immediately. “It’s the right thing to do, and I knew if we needed help like this, you and your family wouldn’t hesitate to return the favor.” “I don’t want to have to ask this, but I do have another favor to ask.” Pete said at that point. “Fran and Priscilla will take turns watching out for Shantill and Whitney, and the mother of one of Jenny’s friends has offered to take her in for a week or two until I get back in town. Monta won’t leave that city until Sandy comes home, but there’s no need for me to stay the full time up there. That leaves Davey, and honestly I’d rather he stay with someone else than stay here on his own. Fran could take him in, but she’s going to have enough on her plate without adding Davey to it, and I don’t like that oldest boy of hers. He’ll just draw Davey into more trouble.” “Papa.” Davey started to protest, but quieted at the look on his grandfather’s face. Mom and Dad looked at each other and then at me for a moment before they nodded at each other. “Pete, we’d appreciate it if you’d let Davey stay with us until things settle down here at home.” Dad said. “He and Brian get along well, and he’s proved to be helpful around the house. We’d be honored if you thought it was good for him to stay with us.” “I can help out with his room and board.” Pete said gruffly. “We had a talk tonight and he’s going to quit his job tomorrow. There’s just too damn much stuff going on with this family for him to waste his time working away. He’s already proved he would if he had too, and that’s good enough for me. I’ve told him tonight that as long as he’s getting good grades in school, and doing extra-curricular work, I will pay his car payments, insurance, and cover Jenny’s bills. The coach of the baseball team offered to pay him twenty bucks a week if he worked as an equipment manager for the team, so he’ll have some spending money at least.” “We won’t take a dime, Pete.” Dad said firmly. “He’ll do chores around the house just like Brian and that’ll cover his room and board.” “You sure about that?” Pete asked. “You’ll give him real chores to do?” “Yes.” Dad said firmly, and my stomach did a little flip-flop. Davey was going to be staying at my house full-time now. It made me excited, but at the same time nervous. “Then I’ll not push that.” Pete said sternly. “Mind you, it’s just for a few weeks until we get things settled with Sandy.” “It won’t be a problem even if it goes a bit longer.” Dad said confidently and Mom nodded her agreement. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” Pete said stolidly. “Davey, why don’t you and Brian go pack your stuff for a week, and remember what I told you.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said as he stood up. I stood as well, and followed him into the house entryway and through the kitchen where he was all but tackled by his blond sister. “I can’t believe this is happening.” Jenny cried into his shoulder while their aunts looked on. Shantill was on the phone again, laughing at whatever she was hearing from the person on the other side of the line. It seemed almost cruel for her to be laughing while her cousins were going through a bad time. “It’ll be okay, sis.” Davey said softly, rubbing a hand through her long, blond hair. “I don’t want you to go.” She whined and I felt sorry for her, and felt a bit selfish that I was so happy Davey would be staying with us. “It’s only for a week or two, and my car will be fixed by the weekend, so we can go see her then.” Davey said. “You promise?” She asked hopefully. “What about your work?” “Papa says I don’t have to work anymore.” Davey said with a hint of disbelief in his voice. That brought a smile to my face, because it was something the Pete Barrow I remembered would have done for his grandson. “Really?” Jenny asked. “What about my appointments?” “He’ll take care of them.” Davey said with even more disbelief showing in his voice. “You’ve got Brian’s number, right?” “Yes.” She said. “You’ve got the number to Stacey’s house, right?” “Yep.” Davey agreed with a smile. “I’ll call you every night, okay?” “Okay.” She said and wiped her nose with the back of her hand like I’d seen Davey do over the weekend. It was a cute family trait, one I’d noticed several times before in the other timeline. “Good, now I’ve got to go pack and you should too.” He told her gently. “Stacey’s mom will be here soon.” “Yeah.” She said with a smile and went down the hallway to the bedroom she shared with her mother. I followed Davey down into the family room where he pulled out a suitcase, a duffel bag, and his school backpack before putting clothes in them. “I really appreciate this.” He said to me as I stood and watched him. Part of me wanted to help, but I sensed this was something he wanted to do himself. “You know it’s not a problem.” I told him and he nodded his head while he finished loading his suitcase and bags. When he’d finished, he looked wistfully at his stereo. “You going to bring your stereo?” “You don’t think it’d be a problem?” He asked. “I mean it’s only for a week or two.” “Dude, if you want to bring it, bring it.” I encouraged him and he smiled before moving to disconnect all the wires. It took only one trip for the both of us to load up the trunk of Mom’s car with his stuff, and when we shut the trunk, we turned to find my parents standing there with his grandfather on the sidewalk. “Thank you for everything, Papa.” Davey said and the old man nodded gruffly before pulling Davey into a very quick hug. That was a loud statement of affection from the man who usually only gave handshakes unless it was to a pretty girl. “You just do what we talked about.” Pete said sternly and Davey nodded his agreement. “Let’s get going so we can get you settled in, Davey.” Dad said kindly and turned to shake Pete’s hand before we got into the car. I could see Pete’s smile when Mom hugged him before joining us in the car. It was a slight surprise, but a welcome one when Davey’s hand reached across the back seat to find mine in a tight grip as Dad drove us home. Chapter 10 Hearing a description of something and seeing it unfold in front of you are two totally different things, and no matter how good the description is, sometimes it can’t just relate the full majesty, or horror of an event. I had stood on a slight hill and watched an airliner slam into the Pentagon in a different timeline, but the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger brought tears to my eyes much the same as the events of 9/11 had in that other time. Like most of the other kids in our school, I watched the televisions that had been placed around the school to show the destruction of NASA’s premier vehicle, and the death of seven astronauts. “My god.” Davey whispered in horror from next to me as we watched the event happen in slow motion while a news channel played it over and over again. There was the sound of a few girls weeping in the library, but most of the kids watched it over and over again in stunned silence as commentators explored those final moments over and over again, and threw out theories on what could have gone wrong. “It was the o-rings on the booster, you stupid idiot.” I murmured to the commentator, remembering another of Davey’s explanations, and realized I should have kept my mouth shut when this Davey looked at me with surprise. “What makes you say that?” He asked me. “Just a hunch.” I temporized. “David Jones, please report to the Principal’s office.” A voice said over the loudspeaker, causing a few students to jerk in surprise, and several turned to Davey who looked confused. “I wonder what I’ve done now.” Davey said softly before walking off, leaving me there to chew on my lip nervously. Could Marcie’s little ploy about where he lived have already born fruit or was this fallout from yesterday? Either way, I knew dad needed to know and I found the nearest pay phone to call him at work. “Go to the Principal’s office and wait for me there.” Dad ordered me as soon as I’d told him. “If it’s about yesterday they’ll probably call you, if it’s about his residence, well I think I’ve got what we need to fix that problem.” “Okay.” I said with as much enthusiasm as I could muster and went to the office. The student on duty there, a friend of Marcie’s, gave me a glare but said nothing as I sat down. “Can I help you son?” The older secretary said after she realized the girl wasn’t going to address me. “I’m just waiting for Davey to get done in there.” I said with a nod towards the Principal’s office. “Oh, dear, he’s going to be a while.” She said with a shake of her head. “We need to get his parents in here and we can’t seem to get a hold of his mother at all.” “That’s probably because she’s been hospitalized in San Francisco.” I said quickly and she gave me a questioning look. “You’re a friend of his?” She asked, and I looked at Marcie’s friend with a significant glance and she got my drift. “Why don’t you come back here and tell me how I can get in touch with his parents.” I nodded and got another glare from the girl before sitting down at the woman’s desk. If we talked in low tones, the girl wouldn’t hear what we said. The older secretary smiled at me as I sat. “Now, you say his mother is in the hospital?” “Yes, Children’s Hospital in San Francisco.” I said. “His grandparents are up there too. She was hospitalized yesterday.” “What about his father?” She asked with a frown and then her frown deepened as her eyes widened. “Now that was a stupid question, of course he’s not someone we can call about this. Where is David staying? Certainly they didn’t leave him alone to fend for himself.” “No, he’s staying at my house.” I told her. “I’ve already called my father and he’s on his way in here.” “Oh, that’s a good thing dear.” She said with a genuine smile. “Tell me, how long has he been…” “Brian!” Dad’s voice called out, interrupting her and I looked over to see my father dressed in his business suit and staring down the girl who looked like she’d tried to misdirect him or something. “Ah, you must be Mr. Breckenridge.” The secretary said as she stood up. As much as I couldn’t really remember her name, she apparently knew me just fine. She walked over to the counter and smiled at my dad. “Your son was just helping me figure out how to get in touch with a responsible adult for Mr. Jones.” “Yes, well that would be me.” Dad said with authority filling his voice. He handed over a piece of paper that I could see had been notarized. “This is of course a fax copy, but you’ll see that Sandy Jones, mother of one David Jones, Jr., has granted temporary guardianship of David Jones Jr. to my wife and me. As he’ll be staying with us for an indefinite period of time depending on the outcome of her surgery, I had planned to file this with the school. Now, I’d like to know why my ward has been called into the office of the Principal.” “This appears to be in order, although a certified copy should be filed as soon as you have one.” The secretary said as she looked over the document. “How long do you think this arrangement will last? When is Mrs. Jones expected to be back home?” “It’ll be at least a month, if not longer.” Dad said quickly. “My wife and I have told her to worry about getting her strength back fully before worrying about David. As far as we’re concerned, he’ll be living at our home at least through the end of the semester.” “I see.” She said with a wide smile that told both my father and I that she was quite aware of what he was doing. “I take it you do know why Mr. Jones was called into the office and why we’re trying to get in touch with his family?” “I’m not sure I understand what you mean.” Father said ingenuously and she smiled even more. “Well, why don’t you follow me and I’ll introduce you to the Principal.” She said. “I’ve met him before.” Dad said. “Yes, that’s right.” She smiled. “Brian, why don’t you have a seat? Davey should be out shortly.” I went and sat down, and within a couple of minutes Davey shuffled out of the office while my father stayed behind, talking to Principal Borsch. Davey’s shoulders were slumped and he barely looked up as he slouched in his seat next to me. The bitch behind the counter smirked at him until she saw my glare. “How did they find out?” Davey murmured softly. “They’re going to ship me back to Ceres unless Mr. B can do something.” “I wouldn’t worry too much about that.” I said confidently “As for how they found out, I give you one guess.” “You know, sometimes I wonder if being your friend is a curse or blessing.” Davey muttered, but the corners of his lips quirked and I knew he was joking, or at least mostly joking. “She’ll pay for this.” I said firmly and he started to laugh softly. “She already has.” Davey said insightfully. “She’s doing this to try and win you back, but all she’s doing is guaranteeing you’ll never give her the time of day again. As long as I can still go to school here, that’s fine with me.” “We’ll make sure that happens.” I said, and since we’d really had no chance to talk about last night, I decided to ask him another question. “What was up with your grandfather last night? Why’s he making you quit?” “I don’t think you heard him and Coach Cole talking yesterday.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Papa won’t say what Cole said to him, but when we got home he asked me some real tough questions. I can’t believe it, but I told him the truth, even when he asked me about drinking and drugs. That’s when he told me I had to quit my job. He told me I’d proven I’d work to support a family but that I should have time to be a kid instead of having to grow up just because my old man was a loser. That hurt, but I don’t think he meant to insult me that time. He asked me what I did in school back in Nevada instead of drinking and doing drugs, and when I told him about being in sports and other stuff, he told me that was what he wanted me to do. Coach Cole told him they wanted me to help with the baseball team, doing equipment manager stuff with Riley and helping the coaches. Then he wants me to try out for football in the fall.” “That’ll be good.” I said with a smile as a happy feeling washed over me. This was what Davey’s high school life was supposed to be like. “Yeah, and I have to go fishing and camping with him over the summer.” Davey said with a snort. “We never caught a fish when I was a kid and went with him.” “It’s not catching the fish that’s the point.” I told Davey. “It’s going and being in the company of the other person, even if you never say anything.” “You sound like you’ve gone fishing with him.” Davey snorted. “Maybe I have, in a weird kind of way.” I said and he gave me an odd look before shrugging. “Well, anyway, I don’t rightly like giving up work.” Davey said with a sigh. “Janice says I have a chance at making Assistant Manager when I turn eighteen next year and that’s good money.” “College gets you better money.” I said. “If you can afford it.” Davey snorted. “There are always scholarships.” I reminded him. “If you’re willing to take hand-outs.” He said derisively. “They’re not hand-outs, you have to earn them.” I pointed out and he gave me a weird look. “Look, you can’t get a scholarship with bad grades, or for any number of reasons. You have to earn them, it’s just usually academic or other work around school or the community that helps you earn them. They aren’t handouts.” “That’s what you think.” Davey said sourly, but he was at least thinking about what I said, I was sure, as Dad came out of the Principal’s office. He turned to shake the man’s hand one more time before walking around the counter and stopping in front of us. “David, Brian, why don’t you walk me to the car.” He said and we stood up to follow him out. Once we were out of the building he let out a sigh. “Davey, I don’t like lying. It almost always comes back and bites you in the ass, but I’ve skirted the line today for you. Pete got your mom to sign a Limited Guardianship for you. It names me as your temporary Guardian until your mother rescinds it after she’s recovered. What that means is that I’m legally obligated to care for you as if you were my son until she says otherwise.” “Thank you, Mr. B.” Davey said in a barely audible voice. His shoulders were slumped again and Dad looked sharply at him. “What that means, Davey, is what we talked about a little last night after we got back to the house.” Dad continued. “I expect you to obey the rules we set out for you, to tell us if something is wrong or you need help, to let us know where you are and not to make any long trips without getting our approval first, and that does include going to see your mother, but I also promise we will make sure you have time and gas to go see her as much as possible. The only real difference this document makes is that now it’s a legal relationship. Don’t think it means your mother isn’t still your mother. As soon as she’s better all she has to do is say she’s rescinding the guardianship and it’s gone. What it does mean, and what’s especially important given the fact that the school now knows you really did not live in the district, is that your legal residence is now our house, inside the Downey District, until and unless your mother rescinds the guardianship.” “You mean… you mean I won’t be forced to go to Ceres?” Davey said with a sigh of relief. “That’s what it means for now.” Dad said with a smile. “Now, more than likely it’ll last just fine for the rest of this semester, but next year you’ll either have to be still living with us or your mother will have to live in the district. “That’s fine, at least for now it’s not a threat.” Davey said happily, and he hugged my father quickly. “Thanks, Mr. B.” “I’m glad I thought of it in time.” Dad said before getting into his car. “I’ll see you boys at dinner.” “Bye, dad.” I said before he pulled off, and Davey was grinning at me. “So does this mean we’re temporary brothers?” Davey asked with a giggle and I felt a moment of horror. Did that mean he and I getting together would be incest? No, and if it did, who cares? “Just be careful, Davey.” I warned him and he frowned. “You know what they say about brothers and incest being best.” “Ewe, gross.” He said, mock-gagging with a finger down his throat. We both laughed as we went back into the school. Practice that afternoon was cancelled, although Davey spent a few minutes talking to the coaches about baseball practice. He worked out a deal with them that let him give two weeks notice at work, and when we stopped by the restaurant where he worked primarily, his manager Janice seemed downright happy that he was quitting instead of upset like he expected. They worked out a deal where he’d have time to work at practice before going to work there for three days this week and two days next week. He tried to offer to work more, but she flat out refused saying they had just hired four more people that week. We’d been home for only a few minutes before Trevor called to say a bunch of guys from the team were meeting up at a nearby field to throw a few balls. It took a little work, but I got Davey to go with me and we went to the field wearing sweats. It almost turned into a disaster. I’d not realized that Davey had almost never played catch in this timeline, when in the last he’d been amazing at baseball. For a worried moment after he dropped the ball for the tenth time, I worried the guys were going to start teasing him, but to my surprise Adam took him to the side while the rest of us continued to toss the ball back and forth. Up until dinner time, Adam worked with him until he was catching just about every other toss that Adam threw him, and doing a decent job tossing the ball back. It wasn’t anywhere good enough to make the team, but it was better than he’d been at the start, and he had a smile on his face as we went home for dinner. That night he talked to one of his aunts on the phone after dinner. The doctors had moved up his mother’s surgery to the end of the week. He’d be able to see her on Saturday, when she should be out of surgery and doing fine. His next call was to his sister, who he talked to for about an hour before making a third call to Todd. I’d barely talked to the red-head in the last week, we’d nodded to each other every time we passed in the hallways. By the time he was off the phone, it was almost bedtime, and he worked furiously at the rest of his homework before going into ‘his’ room and going to sleep. Things were finally starting to come together for both of us, and I slept peacefully that night. Mark Spencer came back to school on Friday, and spent every minute he could staring at us. It made Davey uncomfortable, but we tried to ignore him. Certainly Brandon and Trevor’s presence was helpful to me, although Davey was still a little uncertain around them. I was thinking he was uncomfortable with them on several levels, not just because he’d been intimate with them before, or because they’d at first sided with Marcie, but more a combination of those things. On Friday afternoon, we went to pick up his car. I drove us there, and Dad met us there, a smile on his face as he waited for Davey to see his car. Davey gasped at the first site of the car with its front end repaired, and the car sported a fresh paint job of a dark blue. “You…you shouldn’t have done all this.” Davey said with tears in his eyes while Dad handed him his keys back. “I’ll never be able to repay all this.” “Just don’t scratch the new paint job when you take your sister to see your mother tomorrow.” Dad said with a smile as he lifted the hood to show him the engine. A lot of work had been done there, too, I knew. Dad had spent fifteen hundred dollars on the car, almost as much as Davey’s grandfather had paid to finish the payments due on the car. “Thank you.” Davey said, giving my father another hug. Dad smiled and returned it while Davey turned to me. “C’mon, Brian, let’s go for a drive.” “Don’t forget, you’ll need to give Brian a ride next week while they work on his car.” Dad told Davey who nodded enthusiastically while getting into his car. His excitement was catching and I got into the passenger seat next to him. “Will do.” Davey told dad before starting up the car and listening to it purr a bit before backing out into the parking lot. “Where you want to go?” “How about a milkshake?” I asked and he laughed. “I thought I was supposed to get rid of my stomach, not make it bigger.” He joked. He was starting to lose weight already. “A little cheating won’t hurt at this point.” I suggested and he nodded. Our choice of Denny’s proved to be disastrous. Unfortunately we didn’t realize that until after we’d sat down and ordered. Marcie came in, draped over Spencer’s arms, along with a gaggle of girls and other guys. “Oh dear, maybe we don’t want to eat here.” Marcie said in a sneer. “We might catch who knows what from those two fags over there.” “Let’s just go.” Mark Spencer said with a glare at us. “They might tell their folks we’re picking on them again and try to get us arrested.” “I think you need to leave.” The shift manager said as he walked up to them and Marcie glared at him before tossing her hair and walking out. The shift manager, a thin man in his early thirties looked over at us but didn’t say anything. We were just finishing up when a woman who’d just paid her bill came rushing back inside. “Does someone have a really dark blue Pontiac parked in the lot?” She asked just as we were getting out of the booth. Davey looked sick suddenly and I felt an urge to start swearing. “It’s mine.” Davey said and she came over towards us. “What’s wrong?” “I’m sorry young man, but a car just drove through the lot and a bunch of kids threw eggs at it.” She said in a huff. “They almost hit my car! What’d you do to get them mad at you?” “I exist.” Davey said miserably and looked at me for a nod before rushing outside. I paid the bill and went to join him in looking at the car. Anger warred with tears on his face as he looked at the car and my heart went out to him. “There’s a car wash just down the street.” I said. “I’ll pay.” “No, you and your family have done enough.” Davey said angrily. “They’re going to fucking pay for this.” “Let it go, Davey.” I urged him gently. “They’re not worth this.” “I don’t fucking deserve this!” He grated angrily. “They’re going to learn to not fuck with me!” “Don’t do something stupid.” I said sharply and he glared at me before taking a deep breath. “Why not?” He asked in a slightly calmer voice. “You really think they’re going to get in trouble for this?” “Spencer’s already off the team, and there was another guy on the team with him when they came into the restaurant.” I reminded Davey. “We can make them pay, but let’s do it the smart way, okay?’ “How’s that?” Davey asked and smirked. “Let’s just think about it for a while and make some plans, okay?” I suggested and he nodded sullenly. “For now, let’s hit the car wash before that egg stains the new paint.” “Okay.” Davey agreed reluctantly. That Saturday he returned from seeing his mother with a worried expression, but he also seemed relieved the first surgery was over. She’d be in the hospital for another three weeks before they did the next one to finish the work, and then she’d be there for another six weeks. It was longer than they’d expected, but the doctors said it would be better this way. Pete came back the next day, but there wasn’t even a hint that Davey should move back there. Dad had told Pete about the fact that Downey had almost sent Davey back to Ceres, and Pete didn’t want that to happen any more than Davey did. He knew damn well that Davey had gotten mixed in with a bad crowd there and didn’t want it to happen again. Twice over the next two weeks Davey or I came back out into the parking lot after school and found our cars had been defaced. Fortunately the damage wasn’t permanent or didn’t require more than a bit of touch-up, but Dad went into the Principal’s office with us following behind him and read the Principal the riot act. Borsch was a good man, and when he found out what was going on he took action. Unfortunately, no one was willing to come forward and admit they’d seen what had happened, but on the Tuesday after the President’s day holiday, two security guards caught Mark Spencer and a friend of his attempting to splatter pink paint over my Mustang. That was really bad news for Mark, who was supposed to go to court the next day on the original charges of vandalizing my car. It was also a reason for Principal Borsch to suspend him for a full week this time, and to tell him one more time and he’d be expelled from school. The other kid, a sophomore, got a three-day suspension. Marcie got caught up in it this time, because the police were able to track down a statement by Mark and prove that she’d bought the paint for them. That meant she was now going to face charges of her own. With him facing new charges, Mark begged for a deal from the DA and they rolled both charges together and he got six months probation along with two hundred hours of community service. Davey’s desire for revenge wasn’t exactly fulfilled, but he let it go after we’d learned of Mark’s punishment. The next day, it was all over school that he’d dumped Marcie, who immediately tried to replace him with a guy from the football team, but he told her to get real. For the next two weeks, she got more and more frustrated as guy after guy turned her down. By the time March came around, she was extremely upset that almost all her friends had deserted her. Our baseball season got off to a slow start, but by the first week of March we were on our way to a decent season. If we played our cards right, we might make the division playoffs. With Davey on the team in the last timeline, we’d clinched the playoffs early on, but this time Davey stayed in the dugout helping make sure we had plenty of Gatorade, or making sure everyone’s favorite bat was ready, or keeping the stats for the coaches who preferred to just watch the action than actually write things down. As the days and weeks flew by, I realized that I really did love this Davey Jones on his own terms, and not just because of the man I’d spent my life with in the last timeline. This Davey was a lot rougher around the edges, but he had the same quick wit, the same sense of humor, and the low but urgent drive to prove himself in anything he did. My original Davey had tried to say he didn’t have to prove himself to the world, but the truth was he’d constantly worked to prove himself even if he didn’t realize what he was doing. Dad left his job at the bank in mid-February and started with his new firm. At night he’d sit in the dining room and cuss as he tried to type up his handwritten notes. After the first two nights, Davey had quietly gotten up and offered to help him, taking over the typewriter. His fingers flew over the keys, and Dad’s memos came out letter-perfect. Davey was officially hired to help dad out for two hours per night, and a few hours on the weekend at a rate of pay that bordered on scandalous, although it really was the same rate that they were paying a clerk in the Bay Area. Davey had tried refusing money for an ‘allowance’, but he couldn’t refuse the offer of pay when Dad insisted this time. Two or three times a week he’d go to his grandparent’s house and have dinner with his grandfather, his sister, and whatever other family was there. I went with him a couple of times, but he went alone mostly. Trevor and Brandon came by more, working out with us a few times and other times just hanging around. Mom had taken Davey on two shopping trips, and although he tried to stop her from buying him clothes, and stuff for ‘his’ bedroom, she walked all over him and got her way. Things were going so smoothly right up until Darlene, who was in a class with both of us, asked Davey out on a date. For a moment, I thought he was going to accept, but he declined her offer politely, claiming that while his mother was in the hospital he didn’t want to start dating because he couldn’t give a girl the attention she deserved. Oh yes, he could be smooth when he wanted. As his mother went through her second surgery, and struggled to recover from what was obviously a painful ordeal, Davey came into my room late at night, and crawled wordlessly into my bed. He wanted, no needed, a shoulder to cry on, and as I’d told him I would be, I was there for him, letting him pour out his grief and holding him tightly. We woke the next morning, spooned together, and my body ached for more than the emotional closeness we were experiencing, but I kept that desire under control. I wasn’t blind to the looks he gave me from time to time, the looks of desire when he thought I didn’t see him. It wasn’t something he showed any inclination to talk about though, and the few times I tried to bring up the topic of gay people, he shut down completely. In mid-March, we had a game against a team from Hughson at their field, and we rode with the team on a bus down to the small town just south of Modesto. We won the game easily, and there was a lot of celebration on the bus ride back. Davey sat next to me near the middle of the bus, we talked all the way back to the school where most of the team went into the locker room to change. Not Davey and I though, because we joined Trevor and Brandon in heading to Trevor’s house where his parents were gone for the weekend. Brandon, Trevor and I were still wearing our game uniforms, dark blue shirts with gray pants and blue stirrups while Davey wore his team shirt and a pair of jeans. The rest of the team was changing into their clothes and going to dinner, but we’d basically snuck out so we could celebrate with a bottle of champagne that Trevor had procured and hidden in the loft of his barn. A little voice in my head was warning me that something might happen, given the looks Brandon and Trevor had been sharing most of the bus ride back to Modesto, and the looks Davey had been sending my way, and with plenty of alcohol and no dinner, that little voice was a shout that I tried not to listen to right then. “Dude, you so have to play football next year.” Trevor was saying to Davey when we’d finished most of the bottle. Davey and I were leaning against the rough wood of the barn wall, our legs splayed out in front of us, and his right leg was almost touching my left. The buzz of the champagne filled my head and I put my arm around his shoulders. He leaned into me with a sigh, and his hand landed on my leg, which he squeezed through the uniform pants I was wearing. My shoes had long since been kicked off, as had everyone else’s. Across from Davey and I, Brandon and Trevor were leaning against a hay bail and each other in poses similar to us. Brandon noticed Davey’s hand and smiled as Trevor finished the champagne and threw the empty bottle between us. “I’m not that good.” Davey demurred. “You have to at least try.” Brandon asserted with a slight slur. “We’ll help you practice over the summer, won’t we Brian?” “Yeah, we will.” I agreed and looked sideways at Davey. Most of the stomach he’d had was gone now, thanks to our regular running and workout on the weights at home, as well as P.E. “Okay, I think it’s time for true confessions.” Trevor murmured a few moments later. “What’s that?” Davey asked, trying to sit up straighter, and pushing down on my leg as he struggled to brace himself. I was getting hard at the contact with him, and my pants were tenting up a bit in front. “It’s time we all lay our deepest secrets to bare.” Trevor giggled and leaned into Brandon. I was surprised when their lips locked and they kissed deeply. “Oh fuck.” Davey said with wide eyes, and he took his hand off my leg to cover his crotch. This wasn’t exactly how I imagined this happening, but part of me had begun to wonder if maybe I wasn’t being a bit too obsessive about making my first time with Davey so ‘special’. “You should put your hand back where it was.” I whispered into Davey’s ear, leaning in closer to him. “It felt good there.” “Brian, don’t.” Davey almost whimpered as he turned to face me. There was a look of fear in his eyes, and we both tuned out Trevor and Brandon to look at each other. “Why not?” I asked, lifting a finger to run along his jawline. “Like Trevor said, it’s time for true confessions. You’ve done it before, haven’t you? With a guy?” “Don’t.” Davey whispered as tears formed in his eyes. “I can’t… you won’t… it’s all too perfect. I knew it had to end.” “What can’t you do?” I asked him. “I can’t just fucking do it with you the way I did with them.” He said with a jerk of his head to Brandon and Trevor where Brandon was pulling Trevor’s hard cock out of his uniform pants and going down on him. “Why not?” I asked him softly, ignoring my two friends who seemed to find a renewed attraction to each other after dumping their girlfriends. “Because I don’t want sex with you.” He said and looked away as my heart plummeted into the depths of my abdomen. How could he not be attracted to me? “You don’t think I’m good looking?” I asked him in wounded pride. “It’s not that.” Davey said with a sigh and he looked back at me. “I can’t be gay, what would my grandfather think? Or my mother?” “They’ll get over it in time.” I said with a slight shrug. “They love you Davey, and they’ll learn to accept that part of you as well, eventually. I won’t lie, it won’t be easy, but they will. Trust me.” “I do trust you.” He said and he leaned his forehead into me so that his was touching mine, and his hand reached out to rub along my leg. His body shivered as he did that, and mine did as well at the touch. “The problem is, I think I love you, Brian, and I can’t just have sex with you and pretend it never happened.” “Good.” I said so intently that he jerked his head back to stare at me with wide, surprised eyes. “Good?” He asked in confusion. “Yeah, it’s good.” I said in a husky voice and leaned in to kiss him. When he tried to pull his head back, my hand reached up and pulled his head towards me. As our lips met and my tongue teased against his lips, he let out a whimper that turned into a moan and as his mouth opened and my tongue snaked in against his, he moved quickly to pull me down with him until he was flat on his back amongst the hay on the floor, and I was laying on top of him. His hands roamed over my butt, kneading it and grasping it with passion while his tongue caressed mine oh so gently. I could feel his hard cock pushing out against mine, and moaned when he pulled his lips away from mine. There was a passion burning in his eyes and I smiled at the look of desire in there. “Why the fuck is it good, Brian?” Davey whispered forcefully as his eyes burned with fear and passion both at the same time. “Why the fuck is it good that I love you and I want to be with you the way two men can’t be, like normal people, get married?” “Because I love you too, Davey.” I said with a fierce passion burning in my throat and stinging tears into my eyes. “I don’t care what society or the church says, I want to spend my life with you, just you, forever. Do you hear that? I don’t care what anyone else says, just what you say and what I say, that’s all that really fucking matters. I want you.” “God forgive me.” Davey whimpered as he closed his eyes, and when he opened them they shined in a sky blue color that spoke of his love for me, and our lips tingled with electricity when they met again. “Holy fuck, I’m gonna cum just watching that.” Trevor’s voice was husky, and barely registered on my mind as Davey’s hands began undoing my belt buckle. It was much later that night before we stumbled back into the house. My gray pants had hay stuck in them, as did Davey’s hair, and we were both glad that the parents were already in bed. This time, when Davey stripped my uniform off of me, he did it slowly, as if he was unwrapping a precious and fragile present, and we explored each other for the third time that night, and the first time in my bed. Before, in that other time, we’d gone slowly, building up to the first time we had anal intercourse with each other, but this time I was buried deep in him on that first night, there in my bed. He whimpered and moaned in pleasure as I used all my decades of experience to prove to him I was the best lover he could ever imagine having. By the time we fell asleep, with me still buried inside of him and my bed a total mess, with a room that reeked of sex, the sun had begun to climb above the horizon. “Good morning.” I said a few hours later when Davey opened his eyes. I’d pulled out of him when I’d woken, and spent the minutes watching his face. His eyes held a hint of fear in them, until I leaned forward and kissed his lips softly. “Oh thank god.” Davey said softly. “It wasn’t a dream?” “You mean us telling each other that we love each other and fucking like rabbits?” I asked and he blushed before shyly nodding. “Nope, not a dream. Just remember you’re mine now. Don’t think you can get away just because I haven’t put a ring on this finger.” “We shouldn’t do this.” Davey whispered. “It’s wrong. What will your parents say?” “They’ll say it’s about time I showed some maturity and picked a good person to spend the rest of my life with.” I said fiercely and he gulped. “You mean that?” He asked. “I mean, my parents said they’d be there forever, and look what happened to them?” “My parents are still together, so let’s base our relationship on them, okay?” I asked and he looked at me for a long moment before nodding. “I’m scared.” He said with a shiver and held me tight against him. I was sore down there, but already getting erect again at the touch of him against me. “I am too, but we’ll get through this together, okay?” I asked and he nodded. “Brian, is Davey in there with you?” Dad asked as he knocked on the door. Davey looked scared shitless and tried to grab the blanket so he could hide under it, but given the way the room smelled of sex, if Dad opened the door it would be hopeless. “Yeah, he is.” I called out. “Oh good, by the way, you should really come out here.” Dad said with an edge to his voice. “There’s a message on the answering machine you should listen to real soon. If Davey’s asleep still, let him sleep it off.” “We’ll be out in just a minute.” I called out and waited until he’d moved off before getting out of bed and getting dressed quickly. What could the message be about? Brandon had stayed over at Trevor’s last night. Was it something else, or just someone from the team? “Dude, you look good in those.” I said when I realized Davey had pulled on my game pants from last night. He blushed and pulled them off, picking up a pair of gray sweatpants he’d mistaken the uniform for being. I had to push the sight out of my mind as I was wearing a blue pair of sweatpants and my erection was painfully obvious. It didn’t go down, though, until Davey came in and pulled the front of my sweatpants down to engulf the erection in his throat. All it took was for me to hit the back of his throat and my body jerked in an orgasm as I pulled roughly on his hair. He stood back up with a smile, gave my lips a quick peck and sauntered out the door, claiming the bathroom while I panted and stared after him while the sounds of his pissing could be faintly heard. With a shake of my head I went to the kitchen where Mom pointed to the answering machine without saying a word. She looked pissed, and I knew the call was something bad. While I hesitated with my finger over the play button, a grinning Davey came into the kitchen and got a glass before going to the fridge to pour a glass of orange juice. Mom glared at me again and motioned once more to the machine, and I pushed the button. When the machine began to play, I groaned at the sounds of female weeping. ‘Bbbrrr…Brian, this is Marcie.” She blubbered and I resisted the urge to hit delete. “We need to talk. I’m pregnant and it’s yours.” Davey’s glass shattering on the floor was a sound that reverberated through my mind as I felt my life crashing down around me. Chapter 11 “We should have an attorney here for this.” I muttered as I picked at the tie I was wearing. It was later in the afternoon on Sunday. Davey had left to go visit his grandfather and his sister as soon as he could leave. He hadn’t spoken to me at all, and I saw the hurt look on his face, like he’d been betrayed, and part of me understood that feeling in him. My parents and I had sat down for a heavy conversation after which Dad had called Marcie’s father, who had spent the first part of the conversation yelling at my father before agreeing to come over with his wife and daughter. Now we were all dressed up, waiting for them to arrive. Dad had dressed in his business suit, and I was wearing a dress shirt and tie as well as slacks while mom was wearing a similar suit to Dad’s except with a skirt. There had been some actual arguing, but I’d won the right to lead the conversation once they were here and sitting down, while Dad had won that we’d face them as a family first, without an attorney. This was a serious situation, all of us knew, and not something to be taken lightly. “Brian, we all agreed that we’ll start this like civilized people without resorting to attorneys.” Dad said and I bristled at the unspoken implication attorneys weren’t civilized. I’d been an attorney for most of my adult life, albeit I hadn’t practiced family law, ever. It would have been nice to consult some legal books for case histories, but there wasn’t access to any at this time. “I know.” I said anxiously as there was the sound of a car pulling up. When they rang the doorbell, and dad opened it, I knew this wasn’t going to be a fun exercise. Marcie was dressed to the hilt with a tight dress that showed off her bosom, a diamond necklace and earrings that were probably the ones that my other self had bought for her before I came back in time. She showed a firm expression on her face. Her father looked like he was going to hit me before he nodded at my father. He was wearing jeans and a flannel shirt while Marcie’s mother was wearing a simple but nice dress. “Mr. and Mrs. Ellsworth, please come in.” Dad said politely. “Would you like some tea, juice, or maybe some water?” Mom asked politely and all three of them shook their heads as Dad led us into the dining room. Marcie tried to reach out to grab my arm but I quickened my pace a bit so she couldn’t reach me without being too obvious. Dad sat down at the head of the table with Mr. Ellsworth at the other end. Mom sat on Dad’s right and I sat on his left. Marcie started to cross down to sit next to me before her father glared at her and she shifted to sit on the same side of the table as me but next to him. “Your son has gone and gotten my daughter pregnant, Breckenridge.” Mr. Ellsworth spat the words out like gunfire from a machine gun. “I want to know what you’re going to do about it.” “I’m going to listen to what my son has to say, and what your daughter has to say as well.” Dad said in a firm, even tone and Ellsworth bristled at that while his wife looked slightly uncomfortable. Ellsworth was a big bear of a man with dark bushy hair and a bushy beard while she was much smaller, although slightly plump and had mousy brown hair. How Marcie had gotten her looks from them I wasn’t quite sure, but some of her attitude could be explained by her father’s bearish manner. Then again, this was the first time that I had ever met the man. “What is there to say?” Ellsworth demanded harshly. “He got her pregnant and now he has to do the right thing. That’s all there is to say.” “How far along is the pregnancy according to the doctor?” I asked in a neutral tone, drawing their eyes to me and I noticed how Marcie squirmed. “She hasn’t been to a doctor yet.” Mr. Ellsworth fumed. “We can’t afford the bill. You’ll have to pay for this.” “If she is pregnant, and if the child is mine, then yes I’ll be responsible for her pre-natal related medical expenses.” I said, ignoring the looks of faint surprise on the faces of my mother and father and focusing on the outrage on Mr. Ellsworth’s face. “A woman knows if she’s pregnant!” Mrs. Ellsworth spoke up for the first time looking at me with angry indignation while her husband roared. “What do you mean if it’s yours? Of course it’s yours!” “With all due respect to you as a mother, Mrs. Ellsworth, your daughter has proven herself to be a lying and manipulative young women with no hint of a conscience or morals.” I said and ignored Mr. Ellsworth’s roar of anger and his slapping the table before demanding an apology from me. “Mr. Ellsworth, calm down before you become the second member of your family to have the police called after attempting to damage the property of me and my family.” “What are you talking about?” Mrs. Ellsworth asked as her husband’s face turned purple and my dad looked at me with surprise and worry. “Don’t tell me you don’t know your daughter was arrested for trying to vandalize my car.” I asked with a lift of my eyebrow. “She told me that was just a misunderstanding.” She said with a frown. “It was just a joke that got out of hand.” “Ma’am, with all due respect, your daughter lied to you.” I said. “I did not!” Marcie cried out. “I just got a little overwrought and you got upset. You told me you loved me and would spend the rest of your life with me and then you changed and dropped me and now I’m pregnant with your baby!” “You may be pregnant, with a child that may not be mine.” I said coldly and she started to cry, drawing an angry look at me from her father who put an arm around her. “Who else would it be?” He demanded angrily. “Let’s see, Marcie has bragged at school about having slept with Mark Spencer after she broke up with me, and I saw her giving fellatio to him in his car so that’s a real possibility.” I said casually and Marcie shouted her innocence while her dad roared at me that I was lying. “Then, of course, while she was dating him, she told her friend she was also sleeping with Chad Kipple. Then my friends have told me that even while she was dating me she cheated on me with two other guys, neither of whom attend our high school.” “You liar!” Mr. Ellsworth roared, pointing a meaty finger at me. “You deflowered her, stole her virginity. She told me that herself! She’s never been in a serious relationship with anyone but you!” “Mr. Ellsworth, if there is one thing I’m certain of it is that your daughter has never had a serious relationship with anyone or anything, and most especially she’s not even a passing acquaintance of the truth. She’s a natural-born liar.” “How dare you!” Marcie wailed. “This is all the fault of that creep you’ve been hanging around, the one who convinced you to break up with me.” “Can you not tell the truth even now?” I asked with scorn in my voice. “Or have you really forgotten that you dumped me and told me I’d have to come crawling on my knees to get you back.” “I did not!” She exclaimed before burying her face in her heads and shaking her shoulders with what I was sure were fake sobs. “Now look at what you’ve done!” Mrs. Ellsworth wailed while getting up and going around to her daughter and pulling her in tightly so that Marcie buried her face against her mother’s bosom while Mrs. Ellsworth glared at me. “And to think I thought you were such a nice boy!” “To think I thought your daughter cared about anyone or anything other than herself.” I snorted and my dad touched my arm in a warning gesture. “Be that as it may, here is what I am prepared to offer. First off, we’ll set up a trust account to cover any pre-natal bills if the child is proven to be mine. Second, if and only if a paternity test comes back positive that I’m the father, we will arrange child support payments until the child is eighteen, if she is granted custody of the child by the courts.” “What do you mean if the child is yours?” Marcie’s father demanded. “It can’t be anyone’s but yours.” “We’ll see when the paternity test is done.” I said firmly. “Brian, just marry me and we won’t have to worry about any of this.” Marcie said as she pulled her face out of mother’s bosom. “You said you loved me, why won’t you just marry me?” “If I ever loved you, what you’ve done since January has cured me of that forever.” I said to her coldly and she let out a wail. “I wouldn’t want a little piece of shit like you as a son-in-law anyway.” Mr. Ellsworth snarled as he stood up. “You’ll be hearing from our attorney.” “You’ll be hearing from ours as well.” My father said as he also stood up. “It’ll start with a lawsuit requiring your daughter to submit to an exam by a qualified physician to determine if your daughter really is pregnant. Then it’ll require a paternity test, and you better pray Brian is the father, because if he isn’t, we’ll sue you for libel and defamation of character and take every damn penny you have.” “Oh yeah, well you’ll be sorry your family ever crossed paths with mine!” Ellsworth roared before bustling his daughter and wife out of the house. Dad followed them and Mom let out a long breath while shaking her head. “Brian, I wish you’d never gotten involved with that girl.” She said softly and I chortled softly. “So do I, Mom, so do I.” I agreed with her fervently. “Brian, I don’t know what you think you were doing, but calling a man’s daughter a slut to his face does not make you friends.” Dad said as he reentered the room and sat down. “Dad, I knew that if Marcie’s parents were anything like her, giving them an inch would have been as good as giving them the whole game.” I said. “Do you think the child’s yours?” Dad asked and I shrugged. “I sure as hell hope not.” I said. “I promise one thing though, nothing like this will ever happen again.” “I sure hope not.” Dad said and he gave me a long look. He took a swallow as if he was nervous and I realized he had probably figured me and Davey out. “I’d much rather have Davey as part of the family than anyone like that.” “So would I, Dad.” I said as Mom watched me for my reaction. There was nervousness in my gut, but they both nodded slowly. “You might want to open a window next time he spends the night in your room.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Yeah.” I agreed with a blush of my cheeks. “So, is this… thing with him serious?” Dad asked. “Have you two actually… talked? How long has it been going on?” “It’s very serious, at least on my part and I’m pretty sure on his as well.” I said softly. “He’s probably hurting right now from all this other stuff, I think that’s why he left like that. We’ve talked a little, but not enough, and as for how long, last night was the first time.” “I’ve always said you were a lot like your Uncle Rich.” Mom said with a shake of her head and a penetrating look at me. “Is that why you were with that… that girl? You were still upset over Uncle Rich and didn’t want to be like him.” “You really do know me.” I said with a sad smile and she nodded. “I can understand that, son, but you can see what a mess this is.” Dad said with a sad shake of his head. “Don’t get me wrong, we’ll always love you, but you have to know we’re disappointed in you over this whole mess, and you’ve hurt Davey. I’m not sure you and him… getting to know each other better at this point was necessarily a good thing.” “The timing could be better, but that’s par for the course.” I said with a shrug remembering all the times that life had intruded on my life with Davey. Something moved into place inside of me and I knew it was time to tell all my secrets, or nearly all of them. “Mom, Dad, we need to talk, about a couple of things, not just this, but I’d like Davey to be there. He’s an important part of my life.” “When he gets back, or tomorrow evening after school we can all talk.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “Until then, how about we stick our heads in the sand?” “That sounds good to me.” Mom said with a sigh of her own and I nodded my agreement. I didn’t quite ignore things the rest of the day, since I called both Brandon and Trevor to tell them what was going on with Marcie. Both of them were outraged, and promised to support me if I needed their help. That helped a bit, that they were sticking by me now. It was hard to admit to myself that I had missed them as much as I really had. Davey never came home that night. He did call to tell Mom that he’d be staying over at his grandparents. Mom tried to get him to promise to come over after school, but he backed away from that commitment. It hurt, but I had faith that we’d manage to work through this problem like any other I’d ever experienced with Davey. All night I tossed and turned, thinking about things and how to explain them to him, and to my parents. When dawn came, I’d slept very little and got up in a tired state that not even a shower and a short morning run could quite solve. Even as I pulled into the parking lot it felt like everyone was staring at me and whispering behind their hands. Had Marcie shouted it from the hilltops that I’d gotten her pregnant? I was surprised when I walked between a row of classrooms and the gym to find someone waiting for me. Katie looked nervous, and kept on looking around as if to make sure no one saw her talking to me.",

      "content": "“What is it, Katie?” I asked her in a short tone of voice. “Marcie’s spreading it around school that you got her pregnant.” Katie said in a hushed voice. “It takes two to tango, and we still don’t know which guy was dancing with her when she got bit.” I said and Katie actually snorted as if she was holding back a laugh. “That’s not quite true.” She said in a quiet voice. “The day you broke up with her, you remember, after that New Year’s party?” “Yes.” I answered. “She was complaining that she’d gotten pissy with you because she was on her period.” Katie said. “Then she asked to borrow a pad from me because she was out.” “If she was having her period after the last time we had sex…” I said with a sudden swelling of hope inside me. I’d been right; even if she was pregnant there was no way it was mine! “I… what she’s doing is wrong.” Katie said. “She’s fixated on you like a bitch in heat but it’s obvious you want nothing to do with her and she’s trying to trap you. It’s wrong. I’m sorry, you should know, but I won’t admit it if you tell anyone. Her little brother’s already threatened to beat me up if I mentioned it to anyone.” “Her little brother knows?” I asked in surprise. “She really is pregnant, Brian.” Katie said in a rush. “It’s just not yours. Too bad for you your family has more money than any of the other guys she’s fooled around with, so they’re going after you to get what money you guys have.” “Her entire family knows?” I said incredulously while she nodded. “Just remember I didn’t tell you any of this!” She said in a rush before turning and heading away at a very quick walk. “You couldn’t pay me enough to have your life, Breckenridge.” Coach Cole’s voice said from behind me and I turned to see him walking around the side of the gym. “You heard?” I asked him and he nodded. “Let’s go in my office and talk.” He suggested and I nodded before following him inside. I’d been continuing with the NJROTC two times a week and had even got a reluctant Davey to join. When he had shut the door and we were seated in his office, he shook his head. “So your ex-girlfriend is trying to trap you into marrying her?” “Something like that, yeah.” I said and told him the whole story from the message on the answering machine to the explosive meeting at my house. I even found myself telling him how Davey had left and not come back. “Hm.” He said with a chuckle. “You and Davey, I didn’t see that one coming.” “I–we–we’re not…” I started to protest but he waved me off. “Breckenridge, I’ve seen the way he looks at you during practice and I wasn’t born yesterday.” Cole was nearly chuckling. “I won’t say I’m exactly comfortable with it, but let’s just say that I got use to turning a blind eye at times in the Navy and I see nothing wrong with continuing that here. You aren’t the only two boys I’ve seen making eyes at each other in this gym.” “I bet.” I said while thinking of Trevor and Brandon who seemed to be developing more and more of a relationship with each other. That surprised me, at least on Trevor’s part since he’d always grown out of his man-on-man attraction by college and gone off to marry a girl, at least according to Davey he’d done that in every other timeline. “Well I’m not going to name names, but let’s get back to your ex.” Cole said with a shake of his head. “What are you going to do about her?” “Call her a slut and demand a paternity test.” I answered. “That was always the plan but after that little conversation you overheard, it’s sounding even better since the paternity test will end the issue forever.” “Six or seven months is a long time, Breckenridge.” Cole reminded me. “A lot can happen in that time and if people start believing her, it won’t matter what the paternity test says, they’ll still believe it’s your kid.” “I know.” I said with a shrug. “That’s where calling her a slut comes into play. Enough people believe she’s a slut and nothing she says will stick, and every guy who has ever fucked her will go scurrying for cover and repeat that she’s a slut just to keep people from thinking it might be theirs.” “Breckenridge, I’m never going to play poker with you.” He said with a laugh after thinking what I’d said over. “You’re ruthless.” “When I have to be, I can be.” I said with a slight smile that I knew looked wicked on me and he shivered visibly. “I’ve learned from the best.” “Who is that?” He asked and I shrugged, realizing I really shouldn’t have said that last part. I’d learned ruthlessness from Davey Jones, but a different Davey Jones than the one he knew. When I didn’t answer, he changed subjects. “Have you given thought to what you might be doing to this baby before it’s even born? Maybe about how your rumor campaign might affect it’s life?” “Nothing I could do would make it any worse for a kid born into that conniving bunch that Marcie calls a family.” I said angrily. “You have a point.” Cole agreed with a nod. “It’s getting close to time for school to start.” “Thanks for the talk, coach.” I said as I stood up to leave. “Not a problem.” Cole said dismissively as I left his office and wondered if I could find Davey before first period. Davey managed to elude me most of the day, mostly because I kept on getting stopped by people to ask if it was true that I’d gotten Marcie pregnant. Most of them had reacted with shock at the blunt way I called her a slut and until the baby was born God was the only one who could possibly know whose kid it really was. Her little brother confronted me at lunchtime, furious that I was calling his sister a slut, and probably more upset that so many people believed that claim. Before he could take a swing at me, Brandon and Trevor had restrained him and I walked away before a teacher could notice. He didn’t bother me after that, and my friends were chuckling at the way the rumors were spreading like wildfire. Marcie had fired her salvo, trying to pin her pregnancy on me, but the day wasn’t even half over before people were starting to form betting pools on who the real father was. During the last P.E. period, I heard Adam turn to Davey and ask him who he was betting for the real father of Marcie’s baby. Davey’s face was a look in priceless shock when he didn’t hear my name on the list at all. “What about Brian?” Davey asked in a sharp tone and a scathing look at me. “Didn’t he sleep with her too?” “Yeah, but he’s probably the only one smart enough to use a condom with a slut like that.” Adam laughed and Davey looked at me with a calculating look. “Your mom said you wanted to talk to them and me after school.” Davey said later, during a slow moment in baseball practice. “I’d like to, yes.” I said softly, not wanting to say anything that could upset him at this point. “Do you think the kid’s yours?” He asked me icily. “I know it’s not.” I said with conviction. “How do you know that?” He asked. “My parents deserve to hear it at the same time as you, and you deserve to hear it at the same time they do.” I told him with a voice that quivered a bit. “You’re just as important to me as they are.” “Am I?” Davey asked and I nodded. “I’ll be there.” He said and walked off while I breathed a sigh of relief. Davey followed me home from practice, and I was in such a hurry that I didn’t even bother to change out of my practice uniform before taking off. Davey had to hurry to catch up before I pulled out of the parking lot, and I noticed him watching my butt as I walked to my car. I’d had these particular practice pants since I was a freshman, and they were tight on me. It’d be a cold day in hell before I admitted to him that I’d worn them today on purpose, knowing how he liked looking at me in tight clothes. Dad was home as we pulled up, having stayed in Modesto and worked from home most of the day. Mom was there and while she frowned at the fact that I hadn’t changed, she noted that I was at least carrying my cleats instead of wearing them inside. I took just enough time to put them up in my room before hurrying back to the living room and sitting down on the towel she’d put on the couch. My uniform wasn’t that dirty, but it wasn’t worth mentioning at this point. “Davey, thanks for being here.” I said to Davey first, who was sitting on the far end of the couch but looking at me steadily while my parents sat on the loveseat and watched me. “Mom, Dad, first off I should thank you too for supporting me in this. It’s not over yet, and it won’t be until we get that… that girl to take a paternity test. The really good news is that when we get that paternity test we’ll be out of this mess.” “You’re sure about that?” Mom asked with concern in her voice. “I am now.” I assured her. “One of Marcie’s former friends told me in secret that the day she broke up with me, after the last time we – we had intercourse – Marcie was having her period and borrowed a pad from her. There’s no way the baby could be mine.” “Could this girl be lying to you?” Dad asked. “She could, but I doubt that’s the case.” I answered. “She has no reason to lie to me, it’s not helpful to Marcie, and well, she also let it slip that Marcie’s little brother was threatening her if she told anyone. It seems like Marcie’s entire family is in on this.” “I’ve taken two calls from her father today, and the last time he threatened to burn our house down if we don’t make you marry her.” Dad said with a frown. “I am so glad to hear there’s no real chance the kid’s yours. The thought of there being any relation between us and them is distasteful. Now that you’re certain, I’m going to report his threats to the police.” “You are?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow as he scooted a little closer to me on the couch. I think no one missed that gesture, and Mom smiled. “Of course I am.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “If they are threatening my family, I’ll take whatever steps I can to protect them, including calling the police.” “You want to be careful with that.” Davey said sadly. “Sometimes, when you do that, the press can get involved. Maybe I shouldn’t spend so much time here, if they get wind of my name and threats against you, they’d definitely jump on the story and I don’t want to put you folks through that. You’ve done too much for me as it is.” “You’re going nowhere young man.” Dad said firmly and with a hint of anger in his voice. “If that happens, we’ll deal with it but I won’t run you off because of a possibility of a story or two in the local rag.” “You don’t know what it’s like.” Davey murmured, but he also looked relieved that dad was insisting he stay. “Davey, we know you and your family well enough now to have some idea.” Mom said while meeting his gaze. “We’re not worried about that. We can deal with it, and we’re not ashamed of you, or of Brian.” “Nor would we be ashamed of either of you, or both of you, if that ever came out either.” Dad said and Davey’s hiss of indrawn breath filled the room and he looked at me with terror in his eyes while Dad actually laughed. So did Mom, and Davey started to relax when he realized they weren’t mocking him, or us. I reached out and took his hand, and at first he resisted, but when I persisted he exhaled and gripped my hand with a death grip. “Believe me when I say we’d rather have you as part of our family than the alternatives.” Mom said and then she frowned. “That didn’t come out quite right. I wouldn’t want you to think I was comparing you to that… girl. There is no comparison, really. For starters, we actually like you whether you’re a part of Brian’s life or not.” “How did you know?” He asked in a weak voice and his hand was shaking as it grasped mine so tightly it hurt. He relaxed a bit as I moved my hands so that our fingers were entwined in a more comfortable grip. “Next time you spend the night in Brian’s room, you should open the window and air out the room.” Dad laughed and Mom blushed, although Davey’s cheeks were rosier than hers. “I don’t think we’ll… I mean… oh fuck, I give up.” Davey murmured and Dad laughed. “You know my parents would be having fits at just the thought and I’m here holding Brian’s hand and you’re laughing at us! It’s not fair! I’m not prepared for this!” “Would you rather we tried to break you up?” Mom asked through her laughter. “No.” Davey said softly as he squeezed my hand and turned to look at me before sliding closer to me, close enough to lean against me. “Are we still together after the way I just ran out on you when you probably needed me?” “Don’t worry about that.” I assured him. “You’re here now.” “Yes, well do we have anymore to discuss or should I start dinner?” Mom asked and I let out a sigh of my own. “You better order a pizza or Chinese.” I told her and she frowned. “That was the easy stuff to discuss.” “The easy stuff?” Dad asked with a hint of horror in his voice and he frowned at my nod. “If that’s the easy stuff, I think maybe we should wait until after we eat.” “No.” I said with a hint of pleading in my voice. “If you make me wait, I think I’ll lose my nerve to tell you, all of you?” “Brian, don’t tell me you’ve killed someone.” Mom said with genuine horror in her voice. “No mom, I haven’t killed anyone in the last fifty years.” I assured her, and transitioned into the real purpose of this little family meeting. “I didn’t have a choice then; the Iraqis had attacked our convoy and were trying to take hostages. Davey was the one who picked up a rifle from a fallen Iraqi Army soldier and started fighting back. I just followed his lead.” “You’re not making any sense.” Dad said with a wild look in his eyes while Davey stared at me like I’d gone crazy. “What are you saying?” “Don’t tell me you’re another Mr. Shelton.” Davey groaned, referencing a seventh grade World History teacher at La Loma. Deranged Mr. Shelton believed in reincarnation and would launch into fanciful stories about having lived through the Black Death in medieval Europe. “No, I’m not talking about reincarnation.” I answered Davey while my parents were starting to look like I’d cracked and gone insane on them. “Although, the more I think about it, reincarnation is damn close, except it’s not being reborn into a whole new life, except in this case it kind of is, but not really.” “Brian, you’re not making sense.” Dad said sternly. “What are you going on about?” “Mr. Shelton was a teacher at La Loma.” Davey started to explain. “I remember the man.” Dad said sharply. “I’m asking what the hell it is Brian’s trying to tell us and failing at so miserably.” “Sorry, it’s really complicated and I’m nervous.” I said in all honesty and realized my hand was shaking slightly in Davey’s. He squeezed it in a comforting gesture and I relaxed a bit. These were my parents and Davey. I’d planned this out while I tossed and turned last night, I knew how to approach this logically, I just needed to calm down. “Why don’t you start at the beginning, then?” Dad suggested and I nodded, taking a deep breath and preparing to begin. “The bottom line of the story is that time travel is more than just possible, it’s a reality.” I said in a much calmer breath, ignoring the looks of continued confusion on their faces or the hiss of indrawn breath from Davey. He’d always been a fan of science fiction and was probably better suited to understanding this than my parents. “In the year 2004 of the original timeline, which is this time we’re in right now, a scientist conducted an experiment that would send the memories, the consciousness if you will, of a person back in time to his younger self.” “And you’re this time traveler.” Davey asked, grasping the idea and for the moment at least, he appeared to be withholding his disbelief. My parents were looking at me like I was crazy. “No, that first time traveler was you, Davey.” I told him and his eyes widened and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I don’t remember anything about the future.” He said quietly. “No you wouldn’t, because we jammed that before it could happen.” I stated. “The thing you have to understand about time travel is that cause and effect can happen simultaneously, or effect preceding cause. In this case, when I came back in time, it was 2054 and we sent a signal that jammed any other transmission that would send a person’s memories back in time.” “Huh?” Dad asked with wide eyes and an incredulous expression. “Are you trying to say you’re eighty-five years old?” Mom asked in a breathy voice. “No, I have the memories of eighty-five years of life in another timeline, but it’s a very different timeline than this one.” I said. “Let’s go back to the beginning on this.” Dad said in an exasperated voice. “It all started in 2004 of this timeline.” I repeated. “A scientist in Livermore built the first working time machine and he tested it out on a man named Davey Jones. Davey traveled back in time, or at least his memories and consciousness traveled back in time, and he woke up in his twelve-year old body on August 1st of 1981.” “This is for real, not a joke?” Dad demanded and I nodded. His sat back in the loveseat and weakly waved a hand for me to on. “Davey thought something had gone wrong with the experiment.” I continued. “He had been told he’d only be able to see events from his young perspective. Instead he found he was in full control of his body, and as days turned into weeks, he realized that he was there to stay. At first he tried to keep from changing anything, but on the first day of the seventh grade he ended up becoming friends with a guy named Brian Breckenridge and two others named Brandon and Trevor.” “You weren’t friends with him back then.” Mom said astutely. “Not in the original timeline, but when he went back in time and made the first change, Davey created a new timeline, what we call Timeline Two.” I explained and she nodded almost as if she was following this explanation. Davey was getting it from the look in his eyes. “I bet I tried to stop my dad from molesting my sister.” Davey said in a weak voice. “That was one of the modest goals that Davey set when he realized he could change the timeline without destroying the universe.” I agreed. “Along the way it was discovered that other time travelers had come back in time and the government found out about Davey.” “Oh shit, I bet that wasn’t good.” Davey said stolidly and Dad shook his head. “What’d they do?” Mom asked as she leaned forward. “Fortunately for Davey, he’d made good friends, and one of those friend’s father had good connections.” I continued. “You see, Mr. Rush, Trevor’s father, he’s not really what he seems.” “Is he another time traveler?” Dad asked. “No, he’s a Soviet defector.” I said and Dad’s eyes widened while mother covered her mouth with a hand. “You’re kidding!” Mom gasped. “No, I’m serious, although I guess you could try to confirm that.” I said with a shrug. “I don’t know how they’d react in this timeline, but eventually it becomes more public knowledge after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” “The Soviet Union collapses?” Dad asked in shock and I chuckled. Davey had said that was the one fact that always made the biggest impact on people in the 1980’s. No one thought the massive juggernaut that was the evil Soviet Union could possibly collapse in on itself like it had so many times in history. “It did in the original timeline and several other timelines except the one where they went to war to keep it from happening.” I said. “How many of these timelines are there?” Davey asked. “This would be Timeline Four if you counted just the timelines created by Davey Jones going back in time.” I answered and he looked surprised. “Most of us call it Timeline Five though because Sean Rule came back to save Davey at the end of Timeline Two when the Soviets sank his ship during that timeline’s World War Three.” “What?” Mom nearly shrieked. “I know that name.” Davey said with a frown. “Didn’t he go to school with us?” “Mighty convenient.” Dad said skeptically. “Sean’s the one who picked Davey as a test subject in the first experiment.” I explained and Dad shook his head. “Two other men went back into that first Timeline. One of them was the scientist who created the device, but he died in an accident. The other was a pro-Soviet Russian who wanted to keep the Soviet Union from collapsing. He almost succeeded, but he was forced into open warfare against the United States. By that time, Davey was a known time traveler, at least by President Reagan and his close advisors. He fought in the Navy during that Timeline’s World War Three. At first, he died when his ship sunk, but Sean Rule came back in time to help him.” “How did that happen if the timeline changed when that Davey went back?” Mom asked and I was surprised at how intuitively she understood this. “The time machine creates a bubble in sub-space that lasts as long as the time machine has power.” I answered her question. “Sean Rule was the last person alive in that bubble and he used the machine’s last bit of power to go back far enough in time to warn the President, who issued orders that saved the original Davey Jones from death and ended World War Three.” “That would deserve a ‘and they lived happily ever after, but they didn’t, did they?” Mom asked and I smiled. “Davey and that timeline’s Brian lived together as a couple for a long time.” I half-answered her question as Davey squeezed my hand. There was a small smile on his face. “So what happened next?” Dad asked as he leaned forward, looking interested. “In Timeline Two’s 2004, a war broke out with mainland China and Taiwan.” I continued my story and was relieved that they were at least listening instead of calling for the men with the straight jackets. “Admiral Davey Jones led US naval forces in the area to a crushing defeat of the attempted Chinese invasion, but the entire war was a diversion. They had kidnapped Sean Rule, the only person who had a working knowledge of how to build a time machine and used him to complete their own time machine. They held his partner, Brandon Walker, and Davey Jones’s partner Brian, hostage. Davey led a SEAL team into the facility but he was too late to stop a Chinese agent from going back in time. He was mortally wounded in the gunfight and went back in time again before he died from his wounds.” “Jesus, it’s like a good sci-fi story.” Davey commented uneasily. “I’m not sure who you think I am but that Davey Jones sounds a bit like Superman.” “No, he wasn’t Superman.” I said with a fond smile on my face. “He was just damn close to the real thing. He knew what he thought was right and he fought for it tooth and nail, and he was damn smart. You have to remember, by that 2004 he had over six decades of life experience behind him but he was only in his early thirties.” “That would be… interesting.” Dad said softly. “Hold on just a minute while I get us some food.” Mom said standing quickly and we sat in silence, just staring at each other until she returned with a tray of fruit, cheeses, and crackers as well as a pitcher of ice tea and four glasses. While everyone munched down, I continued the story, taking them through what I knew of that horrible timeline, Timeline Three and its ending in nuclear annihilation of most of the Earth. “It’s like a love story.” Mom said with tears bristling in her eyes when I recounted the death of my other self from that timeline. I had to agree with her, it was both supremely tragic and awful sweet at the same time. “It’s a sick love story.” Dad said, but he was smirking a bit. “So our intrepid hero Davey Jones goes back once more, right? Does his trusty sidekick Sean go back too?” “Yeah, he does, after a fashion.” I said with a smile at that description of Sean who no one here except Davey had ever met. “This time, Davey ended up back in 1976 instead of the early 1980’s.” “Wait, before or after we moved back from Florida?” Davey said with excitement. “After, but boy did Davey make some changes in that timeline.” I continued. “His seven-year old body couldn’t handle the memories of an adult nearly a hundred, so the brain began to shut down after a short while. Before it did, he really made some big-ass changes.” “Like what?” Davey asked with a light in his eyes. “He got his grandfather to place a few key bets, winning a heck of a lot of money.” I said. “He used that to manipulate his dad into giving up preaching and running for the State Assembly.” “You’re kidding!” Davey exclaimed. “No, and for a while Davey went into a coma while his brain returned to its normal seven-year old function, but Davey had set up a system where he was able to warn key people about big problems that were coming up.” I continued with a wistful expression on my face. “Some of those changes included an early warning about AIDS, and it saved Uncle Rich’s life.” “Oh my.” Mom said as tears came to her eyes and Dad put a comforting hand on her leg. She leaned into him for a bit of support. “Yes, well, eventually Davey’s brain matured enough that his ‘older’ self woke up again, and he set more changes into place.” I continued. “His father went from a member of the California Assembly to a member of the President’s cabinet and ended up the Secretary of Agriculture. Davey and Brian were friends for several years before they started dating.” “And dad, he never…” Davey’s voice faltered, unable to speak the question. “No, Davey’s sister was never molested, and she ended up being a fighter pilot in the Air Force and one of the highest ranking female combat veterans in the history of the Armed Forces.” I answered and he shook his head in disbelief before a smile appeared on his face. “It sounds like paradise.” Davey whispered. “I haven’t even mentioned that David Jones Sr. eventually became President in that timeline, the timeline I was born in.” I said softly and Dad snorted in disbelief. “You almost had me going there, Brian.” Dad said. “You should write this down and sell it.” “I’m being serious, dad.” I said. “I was born in that timeline, Timeline Four.” “Then why are you here now?” Mom asked and I smiled sadly. “I assume you and that super-Davey lived a long happy life together?” “We did, with two kids, half a dozen grandkids and dozens of great-grandkids.” I answered and Davey squeezed my hand at those words. “We had a family together?” Davey asked and I smiled at him. “I told you it was possible the other night.” I reminded him and he nodded after a moment. “So what happened?” Mom asked. “Terrorists, probably a Dhu Ghal branch from Ireland managed to get a dirty bomb into Washington D.C.” I answered her question and she looked confused. “That’s a super-long story, but Dhu Ghal was an Irish separatist movement that started after the European Common cracked down on member states. The United States helped them at first, giving them weapons because the EC was trashing the US economy. Then they reached an agreement with the EC and they abandoned Dhu Ghal. When that happened, Dhu Ghal decided to teach the US a lesson and set off a dirty bomb they’d gotten from our country. Washington D.C. was irradiated by deadly amounts of radiation, poisoning most of Congress. “Every President since David Jones Sr. had been made aware of Project Do Over. Davey and Sean had built a time machine, just in case it was ever needed, and President White authorized a Do Over. Sean and I, the only two with the codes who could activate the machine used it to do two things.” “What happened to me, to the Davey who’d gone back all those other times, I mean.” Davey asked and I sighed. “He had a stroke before the bomb went off and couldn’t help out.” I said feeling the grief at that memory well up inside of me, and my voice shook as I spoke. The comforting grip of his hand reassured me though and I blinked away the tears from my eyes. “I loved him, but he couldn’t help, so I went with Sean to activate the time machine. The first thing we did was set off a jamming device that Sean and Brandon came up with over the years. It effectively wiped out the other time travelers and reset the timeline to the original one, the one that would have progressed if time travel had never been invented.” “Then why did you come back?” Dad asked with his eyebrows furrowed. “It seems to me if you took the trouble to undo time travel you’d have left it at that.” “It seems terrorism is a bigger threat than we had imagined.” I said and Dad’s frown deepened. “Then why come back this far again?” Mom asked. “To give me time to think about the problem, and work towards a fix.” I explained. “It’s not something that can change with just a bit of knowledge, but it’s going to take a lifetime, at least, so we went as far back as we had the power to go. I’m sorry Davey, I’d have come back further to stop what happened to your sister if I could.” “I believe that.” Davey said simply, and his trust bolstered my confidence. “What happened to the Brian of this timeline?” Dad asked and I sighed. This was the question I feared the most. “When I came back, his memories were overwritten in favor of mine.” I said. “But you are our son, our Brian.” Mom asked. “Yes and no.” I answered. “You see, much of this timeline, it’s very similar to Davey’s original timeline, although now there are differences since I came back. In that original timeline, Davey and Brian were never friends. I’m pretty sure the original Brian married Marcie and had kids with her. Our lives were mostly the same though, except for the time that Davey struck me out in little league when we were real young, and then later when we became friends in junior high. That never happened here, of course.” “This is confusing.” Dad said simply, but he looked me in the eyes for several minutes before continuing. “You are, but you aren’t quite our son is what you’re saying. It wasn’t you who dated and… and slept with Marcie.” “That’s correct.” I answered. “I think we need some time to think this over.” Dad said softly and I stood up. “You should know, there are some differences in the parents I knew from the last timeline and you, but there aren’t many. You’re as much my parents as they were, and I’m as much your son as the Brian who was here before I came back that night in January. I think you can figure out which night it was.” I said in a rush. “That’s one thing I understand about this.” Dad said softly. “Just give us a few minutes, please, son?” “Okay, dad.” I said with a sigh of relief that he still thought of me as his son. Davey followed me as I went to my bedroom, and he shut the door behind me. I was too scared to turn around and look in his eyes. That wasn’t necessary, though, because he stepped up behind me and wrapped his arms around me, his hands rubbing my crotch through my practice pants. “Dude, that’s some fucking story.” He said as he nibbled on my neck. “What are you doing?” I asked him with a little surprise. “Taking advantage of your old ass.” Davey joked and I turned around in his grasp with surprise writ in large letters across my face. “You’re not…you’re not like grossed out or anything?” I asked him with surprise. When I’d been in his shoes it had taken me days to adjust to this news. “Dude, we’re like star-crossed lovers who chase each other across time.” Davey said with a wicked smile as he pecked at my lips. “If there’s anything that could be more fucking romantic or reassuring that we’re meant to be, I don’t know what it could possibly be. It’s like after hearing that story I know we’re meant to be together and I could care less who knows. Do you know how hot you look dressed like this? You drove me fucking crazy all afternoon and now, now I just don’t care. It’s like I can say whatever I want because nothing can come between us and I know this is what we’re meant to be, together.” “Kiss me.” I growled, not quite understanding his logic, but agreeing we were meant to be together. In another time, it had taken me days to realize that very same thing. Once again, Davey had proven just how much smarter than he was than I. He was also one hell of a kisser, I realized yet again as I came perilously close to an orgasm just from him kissing me. Nothing else really mattered in the end, I was here, with Davey, and together nothing could stop us. Nothing. Chapter 12 Davey and I did little more than kiss and grope each other a bit before my parents knocked on the door to tell us that dinner had been ordered. Davey sighed as I mentioned that I was going to take a shower and get changed, but he gave me one final kiss before leaving the room. When I was showered and changed, the conversation continued while we ate Chinese. “We’ve reached the conclusion that our son is either very deranged, or something we can’t quite understand has happened.” Dad said as we all filled our plates with the food. He and Mom looked worn out already, and Mom had a sad expression on her face. “What we don’t understand is, if this is true, what happened to our Brian.” Mom said quietly, moving the food around on her plate without taking a bite. “I am ‘your’ Brian.” I answered emphatically. “The only difference is that I have more memories than I did before January, and I’ve lost a few memories. Everything else about me is the same.” “I don’t think that’s quite accurate.” Dad said with a frown and a significant look at Davey. “I’ll be blunt about this.” I said firmly, catching the eyes of both of them before continuing. “I’ve always been bi-sexual, attracted to both guys and girls. Before January, I might have allowed myself to believe that Marcie was the girl I loved, but I know better now.” “How do you know that?” Davey asked, speaking up after hurriedly swallowing a bite of chow mien. “I’m not the same Davey Jones you fell in love with in that other timeline.” “Yes, you are.” I said passionately. “You may not have all the memories that he had, but you are the same person.” “That just doesn’t make sense.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Our experiences are part of who we are as people.” “Mom, is Dad the same person you married?” I asked her pointedly. “Is he exactly the same as he was when you met him and fell in love?” “No, and that’s my point.” Mom argued. “It’s the experiences we’ve had since we got married that make us who we are today. How can you say you’re our son when you don’t have the memories of us, the memories he should have from the time he was born?” “I do have most of the same memories.” I countered. “My life in this timeline and in my original timeline was much the same, except for a few minor events. They didn’t start to differ at all until 1981.” “But that’s five years of changed memories.” Mom asserted. “You’re not him, and I want to understand what happened to him.” “He’s here, in me, and I’m in him.” I argued. “We’re one and the same. It’s like I’ve got amnesia of those years, and memories of other years.” “I don’t know if I can accept that.” Mom muttered. “It’s like my son died and was replaced by an imposter.” “Do you remember when we visited Uncle Rich back in ’78?” I asked her. “We got into that argument and I stormed out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. You spent two hours driving around San Francisco looking for me and I was in the back seat of the car the entire time. You hit a light pole when I sat up in the back seat and asked what you were doing.” “You remember that?” Mom asked with wide eyes. “I told you, I am your son!” I stated emphatically. “It’s just that I have slightly different memories of a few years.” There was silence around the table while everyone picked at their food. Nearly twenty minutes passed before anyone spoke again. “So how old are you?” Dad asked, breaking the long silence. “Are you in your eighties or are you seventeen?” “I’m seventeen with a lot more memories than your average seventeen-year-old.” I answered. “ “You said your timeline was different from this one, but that there’s a lot of things the same.” Davey said next. “When the Challenger blew up, you said it was something wrong with the O-rings on the booster. Is that how you knew, because it blew up in your timeline?” “No, it never blew up.” I shrugged. “It blew up in the original timeline that Davey was from. In nearly every subsequent timeline he managed to stop it from happening, and a few other events from happening as well. Other things, like earthquakes, hurricanes, and some wars happened anyway.” “You said you came back because terrorism threatened the future of this timeline.” Dad said slowly, as if he was thinking each word over carefully before speaking. How are you going to do something about that if you won’t let the government know about you?” “It’ll take time, and making sure I’m in the right position to advise the right people at the right time.” I answered. “I had decades of conversations with time traveler Davey, and with Sean as well. Before he had his stroke, Davey reached the conclusion that stopping a single event, or a series of events might change subsequent events, but they alone don’t change history for the better and usually the changes end up being for the worse.” “Why is that?” Mom asked. “Because you’re right in that our experiences, our memories make us who we are as time goes by.” I said. “If you stop too many of the horrors from happening, people forget about the dangers of certain things, and they get reckless. It’s like a kid who’s never been burned seeing a huge bonfire as a young adult and not realizing he can’t stick his hands in the fire without getting burned.” “I’m not sure I understand that.” Dad said and I let out a sigh. “It’s not easy to grasp right away.” I replied. “The fact is that the Challenger accident brought about much needed reforms. With Davey’s shortcut to helping stop it from happening, NASA didn’t learn the lessons it needed to learn and we ended up losing two more shuttles to accidents by the end of the 1990’s. In the end, what we theorized was that what needed to be changed weren’t specific events, but our understanding and learning from those events. In many ways, we need to have our bubble pricked and learn some hard lessons.” “Like what?” Dad asked. “Do you really want a deep political/philosophical discussion right now about international relations and the short-sightedness of our current social-economical system?” I asked while arching my eyebrow. “Not right now, no.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “Good, because I do have school in the morning.” I laughed. “Aren’t you finding school boring?” Mom asked me. “I mean, you’ve been through school already, and probably college, right?” “I’ve been through high school, college, law school, and gone back for two doctorates as well.” I answered and Dad snorted. “You went to law school?” Dad asked and I nodded while he shook his head. “Figures you wanted a lawyer to deal with Ellsworth and his daughter.” “God, I’d be bored if I had to go back through high school.” Davey muttered. “It’s not the most exciting thing in the world, except I do enjoy sports, and NJROTC, and all the other stuff that goes along with school.” I said with a shrug and Davey looked at me like I was crazy. “Besides, if I want to go to college again, I’ll need a high school diploma and they won’t just hand me one if I ask because I’m a time traveler.” “No, I guess they wouldn’t.” Mom said with a slight smile. For the next few hours, all three of them peppered me with questions about my life in the other timeline, and I could see the wariness and distrust fading from their eyes as I answered the questions. Several times my parents asked me questions that required answers slightly different than answers I’d previously given. It was obvious they were trying to delve into the truth of this situation as much as possible by trying to uncover any inconsistencies they could. What food remained uneaten had long since grown cold by the time dad yawned and stretched. “I think I’ve heard enough.” Dad said with a long look at Mom first and then at me. “At this point, I have to admit that as crazy as it sounds, I believe you. I’m still not sure how I feel about everything, but I’m ready to sleep on it.” “Thank you.” I said and stood up. “If you don’t mind, I’ll call it a night now. There’s school in the morning, and I have a test in English.” “I’ll be back in a minute to help clean everything up.” Davey said as he stood to follow me out. He led the way to my bedroom but stopped outside the door and looked at me with a slightly worried expression. “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “I’m wondering about you and me, and all this.” Davey said softly, looking into my eyes as if hunting for a lifeline. “I mean, I know you think we’re meant to be together, and it sounds like a dream come true. But I can’t help but feel it’s wrong.” “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “You, me, the whole sex thing.” He said softly. “I guess I can’t lie to you, you’re not the first guy I’ve had sex with, but I’ve always thought it was wrong; something not to be thought about, much less discussed. Until you, I didn’t even think it was possible to really feel love for another guy, I thought it was just about sex and girls were who you fell in love with.” “I know.” I said sympathetically and he smirked. “Of course you know, it’s me who doesn’t know.” He said softly. “I want it to be true, that you and I can live together and love each other, but I don’t know if I can.” “Take it one day, one moment at a time.” I suggested. “You came back twice and sought me out, and you were right to do that. The thing is, it was me who was where you were at right now, except I never really expressed it to him in words. Davey, the other you, the one with all those memories, he was so confident about us when I knew him. Still, he took his time with me, let me reach the decision that I loved him and wanted him, and he gave me time to work out my issues with the whole time travel crap.” “What did you do?” He asked. “It took me days to reach the decision you did earlier tonight.” I said with a shrug and he smiled. “I’ve always known you’re smarter than I am.” “No I’m not.” Davey demurred. “I wonder though, when you look at me, do you see me or do you see him? Do you love me because of him?” “You are him.” I asserted. “I said it earlier and I meant what I said. The only difference between you and the Davey I spent a lifetime with is that he had more memories than you do right now. As far as I can see, you are, at your core, the same person that he was, and it is those qualities that attract me to you, no matter what memories you do or do not possess.” “So you see both of us?” He asked and I couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s one thing I’ve always loved about you Davey Jones.” I said softly, reaching out and caressing his right arm. “You are quick on your feet and figure things out so much quicker than I ever could hope to do.” “Stop that.” He said with blushing cheeks and I leaned in to kiss him on the cheek. Davey pulled me into a hug before releasing me and turning to head back into the dining room. I got ready for bed, and although I should have been unable to sleep, as soon as I lay down on the bed, I was asleep. The next morning I woke up to icy water being dribbled on my face. Davey actually giggled as he scampered out of my room while I sat up in bed spluttering with indignation. The sun was barely touching the mountains in the east, but I found Davey in the kitchen wearing a sweat suit that mom had bought him the other day. It was really nice cotton pants in a dark blue and a gray hooded sweatshirt. “It’s about time you got up, old man.” He teased me and I realized I was in for a lot of payback for all the times I called him ‘old man’ in the last timeline. Still, the fact that he was taking it so well made me feel good inside. “I thought we’d just go for a run from here instead of going to the school.” “You’re really getting into this exercise stuff, aren’t you?” I asked him and he shrugged while blushing slightly over his orange juice. “I feel better after.” He said with another shrug. “Besides, it’s something we do that’s just the two of us. I like that.” “So do I.” I said warmly, getting my own glass of orange juice. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants that were a lighter blue than his, so after downing the juice, I went back to my room to finish getting dressed. We were now doing a good three miles on the morning runs, and at a decent pace without even having to stop for a walk. Davey was inordinately proud of that little fact, and when we got home to find Mom in the kitchen, he gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek before heading off to the shower, calling his dibs on first use of the bathroom. “He’s in a good mood.” Mom said after he’d left. There was a bit of tension in the air, and while I filled a glass of water, she gave me a long look before letting out a sigh. “You doing okay?” I asked her. “Yes, Brian, I am.” She answered. “I think I’m going to be okay with what you’ve told us. I look at you and you look no different, except for maybe the way you carry yourself. I hadn’t realized it before, but you’ve been a lot more confident without that arrogant pose I’d gotten used to seeing. You are different, but in all the important things I think you’re still my Brian.” “I’m glad to hear that, Mom.” I said earnestly. “How much does this change things?” She asked. “Do you expect to be treated like an adult now?” “Well, I am almost seventeen.” I replied with a smile and she chuckled. “In other words, I’m your son and I’ll always be your son. You’ll always be my mother, Dad will always be my father. Our relationship will change as the years go by, but no matter what else, I’m physically seventeen and I’m living under your roof.” “You had kids in that other timeline, right?” She asked even though we’d gone over that several times last night. “Yes, two boys.” I replied. “Do you think you’ll want kids in the future?” She asked me with a wistful look on her face. “I know you said people’s opinions on gays as parents change, but will you go through having kids again? It must have hurt a lot to leave them behind like that.” “I miss them a lot, but the truth is they were probably injured or killed when the dirty bomb went off.” I said with a slight shrug. “There wasn’t much time to think about that while Sean and I were getting ready to do our duty, but I’ve grieved over them the last couple of months here, and I’ve realized there wasn’t much I could do for them. As for kids in the future, more than likely we will, if Davey still wants them.” “Does he?” Mom asked. “Probably.” I said with a shrug. “Everything’s too new right now for us to have talked about it much.” “I guess so.” She replied and then got a worried look on her face. “Doesn’t the age difference bother you? Every time I think about it I get a little uncomfortable.” “I’m seventeen, mom.” I reminded her. “Sure I have more memories, but that doesn’t make it all that different. I remember being old, sure, but the body really does affect the brain as well as the brain affecting the body. I’m not in my eighties anymore, and I know that.” “Still, couldn’t you use your knowledge to influence him in a bad way?” Mom asked with a worried tone. “I could, but I won’t.” I said with a shrug. “In our relationship, I might have opened the door for him, but I didn’t trick him into walking through it, he did that on his own.” “I did what on my own?” Davey asked as he came into the room with his shaggy hair still wet, but he was wearing a newer pair of jeans and a sleeveless light blue OP shirt with a hood. The shirt showed off his much more slender body, and his arms that were starting to develop some good muscle. I had to turn away from Mom so she wouldn’t see the reaction, but a glance back showed her smothering a laugh. “Fall for this big guy here.” Mom said and Davey blushed while looking down at the table. “What will you boys have for breakfast?” “Cereal please.” Davey said and mom proceeded to get him a bowl. “I’ll have some too when I finish showering.” I said. “Davey, I hope you left me some hot water.” “Nope.” He said with a smarmy grin and I cuffed him up the side of the head before scooting out of the kitchen. Marcie wasn’t in school that day, to the relief of many, and it seemed that the furor over her paternity allegations was already dying down to be replaced by sniggers about her being a slut. I almost felt bad for her as I realized that she’d be shunned for the rest of her high school career, but in the end she’d deserved what she’d gotten. She’d gambled on her future and lost badly. As the days, and then the weeks progressed, things evened out and life became downright pleasant for the most part. Davey and I both took the ASVAB test in late March, just before spring break. Talk about ‘time travel’ became infrequent as he and my parents saw that I was much the same person they’d known and they grew accustomed to the concept that I just had a few extra memories rolling around in my head. Davey’s mother ended up having to go through detox after she recovered from her surgery because they’d given her too much morphine and she’d grown addicted to the stuff. Davey took his sister to visit her every weekend, and I even went with them a couple of time. Monta stayed up there, living in Uncle Rich’s old apartment and turning up her lip every time she saw a gay couple, but other than a few comments about Davey and I ‘being careful’ when we were up there, she didn’t say much. The biggest change was Dad’s business venture. They landed a few big clients right off the bat, and as a result he ended up being gone for most of each week, and even occasionally over the weekends. We all missed him, but Mom was especially lonely, and I wasn’t surprised when she ended up going to see him a couple of days a week. Most of the stuff she was doing was charity work, and she didn’t need to be in town all week. Davey and I didn’t mind since he liked to make love in all sorts of interesting places. That was one of the biggest differences for me to adjust to in this timeline. The Davey I’d known had been a passionate, skilled lover, but he’d been very discreet. Most of the time we’d made love it had been in a bed, behind closed doors and curtains. This Davey found the most amazing places to unbutton my pants, including in the mornings on the way to school, in the gym shower after baseball practice when he’d purposely delayed me so the rest of the team had already left, the backyard of the house after a friendly wrestling match, and along the canal bank during an early morning run. He wasn’t the only one doing the seducing though. I knew him very well, and I had to admit that a young sex drive, and having Davey in my reach again made me very horny. Barely an hour went by when I wasn’t thinking about the next time Davey and I would have sex, and I did my best to get him back for all the times he’d ambush me, pulling down my pants before I could protest. Davey got turned on by a lot of things, and chief among them were tight clothes. Whether it was me in my baseball uniform, or just wearing a particularly tight pair of jeans and a tight t-shirt, I could see his eyes glaze over whenever I wore something form-fitting. Male birds were often very colorful in order to attract a mate, and I knew that clothing always attracted Davey like few other things could. In the last timeline, when his family could afford nice clothes, I’d never quite understood why what I wore could have such an impact on his lust, but having seen the poor clothing that his family could afford in this timeline, I understood this aspect of him better. The Davey of that timeline had been a product of a rather poor family, and the effects of that had stayed with him from his original childhood. “I’m going to rip those pants off you later.” That was something I heard almost every day from Davey, usually as a hushed whisper as we walked from one class to the next, and every time I’d shiver in anticipation of that happening. Almost always he did manage to rip them off of me, and I knew better than to change out of whatever clothing had turned him on so much, rather waiting to let him peel them off of me. He enjoyed it nearly as much as I did. Dad joined us to go fishing with Pete during the middle of March on a Saturday. Davey was surprised at how good of an experience it was, with all of us catching several fish (including Davey actually catching his first one despite all the times he’d gone fishing with Pete as a kid). His grandfather seemed to have lightened up a bit, and barely even complained about paying off Davey’s car or continuing to make his car insurance payments. My relationship wasn’t just about sex with Davey, and although he usually went to his own room and slept in his own bed, we usually spent an hour or two in my room, just cuddling together on my bed while we talked quietly. He had a lot of questions, ranging from how to accept being gay and in a relationship to discussions about the last timeline, and what I had planned for this timeline. Most of the time he just listened, but as the days went by, he started proposing some of his own ideas, or critiquing mine in a way that showed me he really was thinking through my ideas, and that he was willing to be with me through the whole thing, taking an active part in what I hoped would be a productive change for the world. The Monday a week before the start of Spring Break, we all sat in the dining room after dinner for a talk about what we would do for the break. Normally my family went on a trip somewhere for a few days, and my parents would tell me where we were going at this time, having kept it as a surprise while they made their plans. “Boys, we’d planned for a trip to Los Angeles this year, including you, David.” Dad said when we were finished helping Mom with the dishes. “Unfortunately I have a business meeting next week that I have to attend so we’ve had to cancel our plans.” “I understand.” Davey said with a sigh. “Thanks for including me in the plans though.” “You’re as much a part of this family as Brian, David.” Mom said with a smile and a long look at him. He blushed but didn’t protest. “As for what we’re going to do next week, Dad’s having to travel for his meeting so we’re going with him for the entire week instead of just a couple of days. His work will pay for his airfare, and we’ve gotten a good deal for the rest of us and for our hotel rooms. You boys won’t mind sharing a room will you?” “No.” Davey said with another blush and she laughed. “Where are we going?” I asked. “Hawaii.” Dad said with a broad smile and my face lit up as did Davey’s. “Is this something to do with the Grayson merger?” Davey asked after we’d smiled at each other. Since he still did a bunch of typing for dad, it figures he’d have some idea what was going on in Dad’s business. “Yes.” Dad said and he had a proud smile on his face. I was pretty sure that Davey had been showing much more interest in dad’s work than I was, and Dad seemed to appreciate that. He and Davey had really bonded the longer that Davey stayed with us. “Would you like to come along to the meetings?” “I’d like that.” Davey said with a broad smile that my father returned. The last week of school before break flew by as we prepared for our trip. Davey blushed when we went to the sporting good store and I insisted that he buy a Speedo for the trip, but he did buy it, and he made sure that I bought one as well. Brandon, Trevor, and Todd (who was beginning to hang out with us more) were all jealous of our getting to go to Hawaii. Davey’s sister pouted for a day or two, but since she was going to Memphis with her friend’s family, she wasn’t too upset. The only real snag came up when Davey visited his mother the day before we were to leave. At first she said she wouldn’t let him go, but Monta stepped in and told her she was being selfish. Davey and I wisely left the hospital room while Monta proceeded to chew Sandy out about her trying to hold her son back from having fun just because she was stuck in the hospital. When we came back into the hospital room twenty minutes later, she grudgingly gave her permission for Davey to go. It had been a long flight to Hawaii, but Davey was full of energy and passion when we finally got checked into our hotel. Hawaii is three hours behind California in time, so it was late afternoon when we got there, and I spent the hours before dinner with Davey, breaking in our hotel room’s bed. I’d have to remember to leave a tip for the maids because our bed was a mess by the time we got dressed for dinner, and I was walking a little bit funny, hoping my parents would chalk it up to all the sitting during the long flight out here. On Monday while Davey went to some meeting with my father, I was dragged out for shopping with my mother. All things considered, there were worse ways to spend the day than shopping in Honolulu. I even managed to pick up another Speedo for Davey, pitch black with gray stripes, while mom arranged for surfing lessons that Davey and I could take the next couple of days. That meant we also had to get short wet suits for the surfing lesson, and my mouth watered at the thought of Davey wearing one of them. When he tried it on later that night in the hotel room, I hoped the maids cleaning our room were at least mollified by the large tip I’d leave them in the morning. Davey didn’t seem to mind, although he wasn’t quite sure about surfing. We spent Tuesday morning learning to surf before he returned to the hotel room to get dressed for a meeting that he was going to with Dad. During the lesson, I’d noticed one of the other guys that was learning to surf with us talking to Davey, and Davey flirting back a bit. That got me jealous, and Davey noticed the jealousy with a little smirk that oddly enough set me at ease. Davey turning down the guy’s suggestion of meeting up later in the week for some ‘practice’ made me feel even better. The week in Hawaii passed quickly for all of us, and I had to admit that I felt a lot more relaxed than I had been. School had been getting very hectic the last couple of weeks with mid-terms and preparing for the ASVAB. I also had a make-up testing of the SAT tests coming up in April, but during the trip I was able to not worry about that. Instead, I soaked up the sun with Davey, wiped out while trying to surf, went snorkeling in Hanama Bay, and we all went to a luau on Thursday night. Friday was our last full day since we were flying out early Saturday morning, and I’d talked my parents into letting Davey and I go off by ourselves. I didn’t tell Davey where we were going, and he watched me anxiously as we took a series of buses to get to our destination. It was still fairly early in the morning, just a little past nine, and we both wore shorts over our Speedos, and tight white t-shirts. We’d packed our snorkeling gear into two bags that we carried, and from that Davey had figured we were going to a beach, but hadn’t figured out anything else. When we got to the beach I’d picked out, I was glad to see that it was still fairly empty. Together we picked out a spot, put down our towels, took off our shorts, donned our snorkeling gear and headed out into the water. Davey was wearing the new black Speedo with gray stripes while I was wearing a red pair that I knew he really, really liked. There weren’t all that many schools of fish around where we snorkeled, and we ended up playing tag in the water, chasing each other over and under the waves tagging each other on the butt and then swimming off as we were chased. We did that for nearly two hours before we were both tired enough to head back up to the beach. It was nearing noon, and the beach was crowded with people as we waded back up out of the water, carrying our flippers in one hand and snorkel masks in the other. Davey stopped cold as he looked around at the crowded beach and turned to me with wide eyes. “This is why you picked this place.” He said with a little half-grin. “Yes.” I said, moving the mask to the hand with the flippers and reaching out to put my arm around him in public. He stiffened slightly at the touch, but relaxed against me a moment later and we walked back to our towels like that. As we walked there were many guys looking at us, some with lust in their eyes, some with sly smiles, and others with friendly looks on their face. Davey kept staring at them, and when we passed two guys that were so busy kissing each other that they didn’t see us go by, I could feel Davey’s body relax. When we laid down on our towels, dropping our gear, he scooted over so that he was firmly against my side and leaned in to kiss my ear. “I love you Brian.” Davey said softly and I looked up to see tears in his eyes as he looked at me before looking around. “I thought I was going to freak out the first time you and I walked around the Castro. Most of those were just too weird, but here, it’s no different than the other beaches we went to this week except it’s almost all guys.” “I thought you should see this before we go.” I said with a smile as I also looked around. “Do you think they’d freak out if we fucked right here?” Davey asked with a vivacious leer that caused a swelling in my Speedos. Instinctively I moved my hand to cover my crotch, but I decided to tease Davey instead and let him see the lump growing there. “They’d probably just take pictures or try to join in and then you’d be put in jail.” I said with a shrug. “But if you want, I won’t stop you.” “It’d suck going to jail for having sex with my boyfriend.” Davey joked. “Who said anything for going to jail over having public sex with me?” I joked back and he looked confused until I finished the statement. “You’d go to jail for starting a riot after I refused to let anyone but me touch you.” “Har har, very funny.” Davey said as he swatted my arm and laid back on his towel, stretching out to soak up some sun. I did the same, and felt a little thrill as his hand found mine and we entwined our fingers while soaking up the warm Hawaiian sun. Life was good, damn good. Chapter 13 “Guess whose moving back to town?” Todd asked as he spotted me while I did my presses. We were in my backyard. Davey’s mom had come home last week, and he was helping her get settled. Monta had come back with her after having been gone for nearly three months from her own home, and had thrown a fit at the condition of her house. Jenny was back from staying with her friend, and was resenting having to once again share a room with her mother. Sandy was doing much better, and the extra time in the hospital while she got over the morphine addiction had actually given her extra time for intensive physical therapy that had her on the verge of being ready to go back to work instead of having weeks more of physical therapy. “Who?” I asked Todd as I finished the set. Todd still came over two times a week to work out with us on the weight set, and was becoming a better friend with each passing week. “Sean Rule.” He said with a grin and I was glad I’d just put the weights back on their holder because I would have dropped them otherwise. “You’re kidding; I thought he and his family lived down south.” I said, trying not to show exactly how excited I was by the news. “Yeah, well I just heard they’re moving back here over the summer.” Todd said. “I remember what you said about wanting to apologize to him for what you did back in freshman year, and now you’re going to get your chance. Don’t worry, I’ll put in a good word for you beforehand.” “Thanks.” I said sardonically. “Okay, let’s get these set up for me.” Todd said, changing the subject. “I’m not a big fucking ape like you and Davey.” “Well at least you’re no longer a pee-wee.” I said as I stood up and wrapped my hand around his biceps. He was definitely more toned there. “Hey, hands off the merchandise or I’ll tell my best friend you’re playing around on him.” Todd teased, having already figured out Davey and I, of course his catching us making out one day in the garage helped him put two and two together. “You’re just jealous.” I teased him back as we took off some of the weights for him to do his own set. “Damn right I’m jealous, I should have had Davey.” Todd smirked. There was just enough bitterness in his voice that I knew he was partially serious, but the look in his eyes also told me that he was resigned to the fact that Davey was mine. That was a good thing, Todd was a good guy and I’d hate to have to set him straight on how things stood. “Who wouldn’t be?” I said instead of something harsher and he chuckled before lying back on the bench and getting ready for his sets. Forty minutes later he was driving off in his beetle and I took my third shower of the day to clean off the sweat from our workout. Davey came home after dinner, and one look at his face had me worried. His eyes were red and puffy. “What’s wrong, honey?” Mom asked as soon as she saw him enter the living room where we were watching television with Dad who’d actually gotten home earlier than normal. “I… it’s my mom.” Davey stammered and mom was up off the couch and hugging him before guiding him over to sit next to me. His hand found mine and clasped it tightly. “What’s wrong?” Dad asked. “I thought she was home from the hospital?” “She is.” Davey sniffed, barely holding back the tears. “That’s what’s wrong.” “What do you mean?” Mom asked while putting a hand on his shoulder. “She… she’s already got a job lined up for as soon as the doctor clears her for work.” Davey sniffed again. “She’ll start in a couple of weeks and as soon as she does, she wants to move out of Nanny’s.” “Shouldn’t that be a good thing?” I asked with a frown. “It is.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “The only problem is that she wants me to move back in with her.” “Dear, she’s your mother; of course she wants her children home with her.” Mom said gently and Davey shook his head. “That’s the thing, she’s not sure where we’re going to move.” Davey moaned softly. “Jenny wants to stay at Ceres High, that’s where all her friends are, and if mom gets a place in Ceres, that means I have to go to Ceres as well and I don’t want to go to that stupid school. Mom’s considering moving into a place in Downey’s district, but Jenny’s dead-set against it and I can’t make mom choose me over Jenny. It wouldn’t be right, I mean my sister’s been through so much – more than me – and she deserves to go to the school where her friends are.” “So do you.” I said with a firm clasp of his hand in mine and he sighed. “It wouldn’t matter anyway, because if she moved into Downey’s district it would be more expensive than the housing in Ceres.” Davey said with a sigh. “Either way, she won’t make enough money on her own, and Dad’s barely making enough to pay Grandma Jones the rent she charges him for staying with her. That means I’ll have to get a real job.” “You already do work for me, that is a real job.” Dad said and Davey let out a bark of laughter. “I’m sorry, Dad B.” Davey said. He’d started calling Dad that after the Hawaii trip and my father still smiled every time he heard Davey say it, even now. “I don’t mean that it’s not a real job just that I don’t make as much money doing it like I did at McDonald’s. Sure, I make more per hour, but I had a lot more hours and Mom will need that money to make rent and pay for food and all that.” “What about your after-school activities and the stuff we’ve already planned for the summer?” I asked him and he frowned. “I’m sorry, Brian, but I’m just not going to be able to do all that.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and a shake of his head. “Mom needs the extra money and I need to help her and Jenny first, before anything else. It just wouldn’t be right for me to do otherwise.” “What about college, David?” Dad asked while I contemplated Davey. His mouth was set in a determined way that I knew all too well. He’d made up his mind, and right now there would be no moving him. He did grimace at dad’s question though. “I can go to MJC part-time after I finish high school next year.” Davey said after a moment of thinking. He looked over at me sympathetically. “I know you wanted me to go to school with you, Brian, but you understand, don’t you? After Jenny graduates, mom won’t need my help anymore and then I can go meet you wherever you’re going to school. Credits from MJC will transfer, right?” “Yes, they will.” I said with a sigh. “Are you sure about this? Davey I know you want to help them but is it worth the cost to yourself?” “Of course it is.” Davey snorted indignantly. “If that’s your decision, that’s your decision.” Dad said with a note of finality. “We’re going to miss having you around here, son.” “I’ll still be around.” Davey said with a sad smile. “I mean, it’s not like I’m breaking up with Brian, and I really do appreciate everything you have all done for me so I’ll be here whenever I can get away.” “You’re at least going to finish the year at Downey, right?” Mom asked. “Yeah, and if we’re lucky, Mom will pick the place in Modesto so I can still go there.” Davey said with a little smile. “We can always continue using Nanny’s address for Jenny so she can go to Ceres, and either Mom or I can take her there in the mornings.” “That would be good.” I said and squeezed Davey’s hand again. “I’ve got some homework to do now if you don’t mind.” Davey said as he stood up. Both Mom and Dad gave him a hug before he went into his bedroom and I was left in the living room with my parents. “What do you think, Brian?” Dad asked me softly when Davey was gone to his bedroom. “He’s set on doing this.” I said with a shrug. “He obviously doesn’t like it, but he thinks it is the right thing to do, and he’ll do anything for his mother and sister.” “Even after what his mother did when she brought him back to California?” Mom asked. I’d told her that part of the story and she’d been furious for most of that night. “Even after that.” I answered her question. “Davey’s very forgiving when it comes to those he loves. You know he went to talk to his father last week, right?” “He didn’t tell us that.” Dad said with surprise. “What happened?” “His father was trying to make a go at selling medical equipment but the company folded.” I explained. “The man’s desperate for a job, and he asked Davey’s help in getting a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres.” “Ouch.” Dad winced. “That must be hard for both of them.” “Yeah, well Davey did it.” I said with a shake of my head. “His dad’s going to be hired at the Ceres restaurant and is being trained to be an Assistant Manager there.” “I hope that works out for him.” Mom said. “So what do we do about this?” Dad asked. “You know him better than us.” “Right now there’s not much we can do.” I said with a shrug. “Except be there for him when he needs support, and make sure that he knows we care about him. He has to make his own decisions and he’ll resist any effort to persuade him differently as long as his mother keeps pushing this.” “We can talk to her, then.” Mom said with a determined look. “She has to see this is not what’s best for Davey.” “She’s even more stubborn than Davey.” I said with a short laugh. “So we’ll just have to wait and see, and be there for David if he needs us.” Dad said and I looked at him with a question in my eyes that he understood. “Brian, I told you once that we felt sorry for him with the bad luck he’s had in life. Since we’ve gotten to know him, both your mother and I have found that we love him like he’s our second son.” “Thanks, dad.” I said with affection. Davey was edgy around me all that night and the next morning, not quite sure about how I would take his decision. I may not have been happy about it, but I knew better than to try to force him to change his mind. Plans could be changed, and nothing about his decision would make my long-range plans untenable, it would just delay them a few years. When he finally realized that I wasn’t going to argue with him about his decisions, he warmed up a little. That afternoon he went with his mother and sister to look at possible places for them to move. His mother wasn’t quite able to drive yet, so he took them in his car. I spent the time doing homework and some chores around the house. Dad got back just after six that night and we sat down for a quiet dinner with just the three of us. We were just finishing when there was a loud knock on the door, and I got up to answer it. “Your parents home, Brian?” Pete Barrow asked with a frown as I opened the door. “We’re just finishing up dinner, Mr. Barrow.” I answered in surprise and he grunted. “Good, I’d like to talk to them, and you I guess.” He said grumpily. “Come in, please.” I replied standing aside and feeling a little glimmer of amusement. Pete was probably as unhappy about things with Davey as we were, and I had a good idea that he was here to try to enlist our aid in changing Davey’s mind, or his mother’s, or both of them. “Pete, what a surprise!” My mom said with delight as we entered the dining room. She got up and gave him a hug as well as a kiss on the cheek. Pete’s face softened at that and he was almost smiling as he turned to shake hands with my father. “It’s nice to see you Brenda.” Pete said and he gave both of my parents a sharp look. “I’d like to talk to you both, and Brian too, if you don’t mind. It’s about Davey and that damn fool of a daughter of mine.” “We’d be happy to talk with you.” Dad said with a smile. “Can I get you anything?” Mom asked. “Coffee, if you have some made.” Pete replied. “I was actually getting ready to make some.” Mom said with a smile. “Why don’t I go ahead and get it started?” “That’ll be fine if it’s no trouble.” Pete replied with a twinkle in his eye. He turned back to my father and a scowl flittered across his face. “I take it Davey’s told you about his mother’s fool idea?” “Yes, he has.” Dad said as Mom went into the kitchen. “I’ve done tried to talk sense into the two of them.” Pete grumped. “They’re both as stubborn as Monta, though.” “Coffee will be ready in just a minute, Pete.” Mom said as he came back into the room and we all sat down at the table. “Thanks, Brenda.” Pete said with a nod. “I don’t see what we can do, but we’ll do anything we can to help David.” Dad said to Pete. “He’s a good young man with a bright future.” “He is that.” Pete agreed. “The problem here is that Sandy and Monta are thinking about what’s best for Sandy and Jenny. That girl is starting to go a bit wild and needs more attention from her mother. What they aren’t doing is thinking about what’s best for Davey. If they did they wouldn’t be trying to drag him back and forcing him to give up his future so that Sandy can feel like she’s got her family again.” “Part of the problem is David’s willingness to put off his future for them as well.” Mom said quietly before getting up to go into the kitchen and prepare the coffee. No one said anything until she came back with a tray of coffee and cups for everyone. “That boy is frustrating sometimes.” Pete said with an explosive exhalation. “He goes and gets his back up when anyone criticizes his father and runs off in a temper, but then the moment Monta or Sandy ask him to do something for them he falls all over himself doing it, no matter what it costs him.” “So the key here is getting Monta and Sandy to change their minds?” Dad asked. “Yes, and that’s what makes it so hard.” Pete explained. “They get a fool idea in their head and they go with it without thinking things through.” “Do you have any ideas on how to change their minds?” Mom asked and Pete shrugged. “We just have to make them see what this’ll cost Davey and make them believe it’s not worth the cost.” Pete shrugged. For the next hour we discussed a few ideas, and it was decided that they’d be tried out when we went over to Pete’s house for dinner later in the week. He’d suggested that Monta should fix us a dinner as a ‘thank you’ for all the help we’d given them, and afterwards Pete would start up a conversation that we all hoped might change their minds. Pete left looking a little less dour than when he’d arrived, and Davey called to say that he’d be staying there in Ceres for the night. I managed to get Davey to go with me to lunch the next day at school. He’d been acting a bit sheepish all day, as if he expected me to be angry, but relaxed as we sat down in the diner we’d driven to in my car. As the waitress brought our plates and we dug in, he lowered his guard. “Did you find a good place yesterday?” I asked as he took a bite of his sandwich. He frowned as he chewed and then swallowed. “Yeah, but the one we can afford best is in Ceres.” He said with a shrug. “It’s only two bedrooms, but it’s affordable. I’d have liked the one in Modesto, but it was just too expensive.” “Even with you working?” I asked him, trying not to show my true feelings about all this. “It sucks, but it’s for the best.” Davey said with a sigh. “Mom wants us all together again, and she’s got a point. We might have been able to afford the bigger place in Modesto, but Janice won’t hire me back.” “Why not?” I asked while frowning at the bitterness in his voice. “I thought they really needed people?” “They did, but after I left she hired two people to replace me and the other restaurant hired someone else as well so they don’t need me to fill in there either.” Davey’s voice was sour, but I tried not to show my smile. “It took them hiring two people to replace you?” I asked him while letting my smile show slightly, hoping he’d not think I was happy he’d not been hired back. “Yeah, well, and then I’d asked her a week ago to help my dad get a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres and they hired him so there’s no job for me there.” Davey grumped, but he did smile a bit at the compliment. “What are you going to do now?” I asked him as I took a bite of my salad. “I heard the Burger King in Ceres was hiring.” He said with a shrug. “Janice said she’d give me a good recommendation.” “Have you thought about doing something besides fast food?” I asked him. “You’ve been doing office work for dad, right?” “Uh huh, but it’s hard to find that kind of job while going to school.” Davey answered with another frown. “We’ll think of something.” I said confidently and the smile came back to his face. “I know you’re probably upset that I’m turning my back on you and your folks after all you’ve done for me.” Davey said a few minutes later after we were mostly done with our food. The waitress refilled our glasses of water while I shook my head. “You’re not turning your back on us.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “They are your family so I understand.” “You sure?” Davey asked and I smiled. “The question is are you sure?” I asked and he frowned at me while sighing and leaning back in the booth. “I’m sure.” Davey said with false bravado in his voice, and under my stare he quickly deflated, sagging against the back of the booth on his side. “Damn it, you know, don’t you? It’s tearing me up inside and I hate this.” “I’m sorry.” I said as I chuckled. The situation was funny, in a way. “What are you laughing at?” He asked sourly. “Sorry, it’s just that it’s weird being on this side of the conversation.” I said and he squinted at me with his blue eyes for a moment. “What do you mean?” He asked. “Let’s just say I remember spending a few decades with a man who knew me at times better than I did.” I said with a shrug. “He knew me from so many other lifetimes that at times it was like I couldn’t fool him no matter how hard I tried.” “Now you know me that way.” Davey said with a slow smile. “Well, yes and no.” I admitted with a shrug. “What do you mean?” Davey asked. “Well, the Davey I knew, he had all the experiences you’ve had, but he’d lived a hundred years since the first time he was seventeen.” I explained. “I knew the person he’d become through all the experiences you’re going through now, and well, you’re already a little different than he was.” “How’s that?” Davey frowned. “Well, by this time, that Davey had already been kicked out of Downey.” I answered softly and almost winced at the frown on his face and the way a little line furrowed between his eyebrows. “Why was I, him, kicked out?” Davey asked. “Because he kept missing classes to work two jobs.” I answered. “He just quit going altogether when he got a promotion at that McDonald’s, and they kicked him out. I remember how embarrassed he was to tell me that they’d transferred his enrollment to a continuation school and he didn’t even know about it until he showed up at school one day after not going for three weeks.” “That must have sucked.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Why’d he do that?” “Because his, your, mother and sister needed the money.” I said with a shrug. “What are you trying to say?” He said with an accusatory tone. “You trying to say I’m about to make the same mistake he did?” “No, I’m just telling you what I know happened.” I replied calmly. Davey upset, as he was now, had to be handled carefully or he’d push back hard. “You are your own person, and your life is already different than his. I don’t know for sure what will happen if you do what you’re talking about now. Davey, remember, this timeline is different than the one I knew, and it’s different already than the one that Davey told me about. Every day we live is part of a new timeline, and I don’t know what’s going to happen with you and me. I know what I want to happen, not what will.” “Why is it always about what other people want from me?” Davey snorted with a look of angst on his face. “What is it you want?” “I want to live my life with you.” I said simply with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “I want to grow old with you, be a part of your life and have me always be a part of yours.” “What if I don’t want that?” He asked and for a moment my heart stopped at the thought. The first few thoughts that came to my head I quickly bit back, and took a deep breath. Davey was watching me closely, and I knew this was an important moment. “Then I’ll have to respect your wishes no matter how much I don’t like it.” I said slowly and he narrowed his eyes. “You won’t try to convince me otherwise?” He said disbelievingly as I snorted. “Of course I will!” I snapped with a bit of irritation. “I’ll make damn sure you know what you’re giving up if you choose to walk away from me, from us, but it’s your damn choice to make no matter what I think about it.” “But don’t you have a say in… this?” He asked me and I looked at him with confusion for a moment before I realized what he was asking. “I made that choice a long time ago from my perspective, Davey Jones.” I told him. “In all those years, I’ve never regretted my choice to live my life with you, either the you I knew before or the you I’m getting to know now.” “I don’t understand it.” Davey admitted softly. “How two men can love each other the way you obviously love me, or him, or both of us, I don’t understand.” “You will.” I assured him and he smiled softly for a moment. “It scares me that I believe you when you say stuff like that, and for a moment I think I can be happy like this, living with another guy.” He said with a heavy sigh. “Then that other voice comes back, and it tells me I’m sinning and I’m going to hell unless I repent, and I think about what happens when Mom, or Dad, or god forbid, Nanny and Papa find out.” “They’ll go berserk at first, but eventually they’ll realize they love you.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “You’ll have fights with them, and then they’ll come around, telling you that they love you no matter what. At first they’ll be standoffish, and then they’ll gradually become more and more accepting until they accept me just as they would have if I was a woman you’d married that they didn’t quite approve of, but that made you happy.” “Like a catholic?” Davey snorted and I laughed. He looked at his watch and frowned. “We better get going. We’re almost late for class.” After school he left to go out with his mother and sister. It was fairly apparent his mother had decided on the Ceres location, and that they were going to do the last bit of paperwork for that. I had a few hours after school, and some time to myself to really think about this, and to make some decisions. When Mom and Dad were both home, I had a long conversation with them and presented my ideas. The timing of everything was fortuitous, and as we drove to Ceres, we made the stop at the convenience store on Yosemite Boulevard. “You sure about this?” Mom asked as she put the little slip of paper in the card we had gotten for Davey’s mother. “Yes.” I assured her. “Aren’t you meddling?” Dad asked as we pulled back onto the road. The airport looked odd without the corporate jet hangars, I noticed with a small corner of my brain. “How does this affect the timeline and your plans?” “It helps Davey, that’s what’s important.” I said firmly. “It keeps things on track with my plans.” “But, how do you know his mother will make the right choices?” Mom asked. “That’s where you come in.” I said firmly. “She needs friends, Mom. You and her got along real well in the last timeline. There’s no reason you shouldn’t get along in this one. You worked for her for a long while there.” “I did?” Mom asked with a frown. “Yes, and you both made a lot of money.” I said with a slight smile. “Mom, she’s been a pastor’s wife since she was out of high school. Along the way she’s held a lot of other jobs, but she was always the wife of a preacher. That made her isolated in a way, from other women her age. I remember Davey talking about how happy he was to see her with so many friends her own age in the last timeline. In a way, that kind of describes his parents. Both of them lived lives that were filled with other people, but they were isolated in one way or another for the most part, at least until the last timeline.” “For some reason that makes some sense.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You both have friends that you do things with all the time.” I pointed out to them. “There are the Rushes, the Walkers, the Bettencourts, and a few others. All friends you’ve had for years and years.” “Speaking of them, what’s going on between Brandon, Trevor, and you?” Mom asked with a little frown as we entered Ceres proper. How many times had I driven this route with Davey in the last time as we visited his mother’s parents, and his father’s mother? The two sets of family literally lived ‘right around the corner’ from each other. Most people would consider it a blessing to have grandparents so close to each other, but I knew from a lifetime of experience that it was both a blessing and a curse. Then again, we’d followed a similar example buying both our Washington and our Modesto homes so close to his and my parents’ homes. My how the boys had loved that, trudging from house to house to get Christmas presents and candy from their different sets of grandparents. It was amazing how spoiled they had been, and yet turned out to be such fine young men. “Brian?” Mom’s voice was concerned as she looked at me in the back seat of the car. “Are you okay? You look like you’re about to cry.” “I was just remembering something about… about the boys.” I murmured softly and she frowned softly, but there was sympathy in her eyes. “How do you deal with that?” She asked me. “I would die if I lost you because I…” “I didn’t lose them.” I said vehemently. “They might be born again in this timeline, but they at least lived long, full lives in the last one.” “But it still hurts.” Mom stated and I nodded. “About Trevor and Brandon.” I said, picking up her question. “They’re just being… teenagers. Don’t worry, it’ll take a little time, but we’ll be back to being friends the way we’ve always been.” “That’s good to hear.” Dad said firmly as we pulled onto Myrtlewood and approached Pete and Monta’s house. Monta answered the door, and we were welcomed inside. Shantill was there, with her infant daughter, as were Davey’s mother, his sister, and one of Jenny’s friends. The house was crowded with all these people, and I couldn’t blame Sandy for wanting to move out. “My, you’re as big as Davey.” Monta said with a bright smile as she tried to push some Kool-Aid into my hand. I took it with a smile. “Thank you, ma’am.” I said with a smile. “Where is he?” “Oh, he got called for a job interview!” Monta said with a smile. “He did?” My voice almost cracked at that, and I noticed how Dad’s face flickered into a frown. Unfortunately, so did Davey’s mom and she frowned as well. There was no doubt in my mind they were frowning for different reasons though. “Yes he did!” Monta said, totally oblivious to the undercurrents in the kitchen and dining room area of her home. Pete was standing in the doorway that separated the area from the living room, and he was frowning as well. “Monta talked to her old shift supervisor at the cannery.” Pete grumbled with an intense look at dad. “She thinks he can get an evening and weekend shift there.” “They pay good, and he can work more during the summer.” Davey’s mother said with a defensive tone. “That was very nice of you to get him an interview.” Dad said to Monta who practically beamed. “Well, he’s a good boy.” She said. “He’s always doing his best for his mother and sister.” “It smells so good in here.” Mom said to change the subject, and Monta went on to tell Mom what she was cooking. “Davey will like going to Ceres next year.” Jenny said as I moved into the family room. It had once been the garage, but Pete had converted it into a huge family room years ago. I noticed Davey’s bed off in the corner and tried not to frown at the idea of him having to sleep down there. “Really?” I said, not quite sure what to make of her tone. This young teenager was nothing like the Jenny Jones I had known in the last timeline. She was an odd mix of adult and childish behaviors. One moment she would be more mature than her age, and then the next a spoiled brat. The Jenny I had known had always been supremely confident, gregarious, and an overall joy to be around. This Jenny would be similar, and then go into a pout, or a fit of rage that I wasn’t sure how to deal with. Tonight she seemed, edgy, almost jealous in a way. “Yeah, so you probably won’t be seeing as much of him.” She said. “That won’t change us being friends.” I said calmly. She frowned and walked away, taking her friend Stacey with her. That was a bit of a relief because Stacey was giving me an all too familiar look through her eyelashes. “Do you know my brother, Christopher?” Shantill asked me as she came into the family room, having left her daughter in Pete’s arms. “He went to Downey didn’t he?” I asked and she smiled with a look very similar to the one Stacey had been giving me. Since I remembered having to dodge roving hands from another Shantill, I made sure to leave as much distance as possible. Luckily, I was saved by Mom calling me to help set the table for Monta. Dinner was nice, even with the undercurrents running through the room. For some reason, it seemed Jenny was jealous of me for the amount of time Davey spent at our house. Stacey and Shantill took turns trying to pass me more food while giving each other murderous looks, and Davey’s mother kept giving my mother and father defensive looks as if she was worried about them looking down on her. “I’m home.” Davey’s voice called out when dinner was almost over, and there was a flurry of activity as Monta got up and set an extra place at the table for him, putting him next to me. “Well, what did he say?” His mother asked after he’d gotten settled. “I’ve got a job starting in two weeks, if school will approve the work permit.” Davey said with a shrug. Monta cheered, as did Jenny and his mother. “Congratulations, Davey.” Dad said after his immediate family had gotten done doing the same thing. “Thanks, Mr. B.” Davey said with a slight smile. “Why does the school have to approve you working there?” His sister asked after a few minutes. “It’s all the heavy machinery.” Davey said with a shrug. “Normally you can’t work there until you’re eighteen, but, well, because of Nanny having worked there, they’ll risk hiring me. I’ll talk the school counselor into it, don’t worry. They pay almost eight dollars an hour! That’s over twice minimum wage. I can get about four hours a night during the week, and then a full day on Saturday and Sunday.” “You’ll have a couple days off a week, won’t you?” Mom asked with a frown. “Um, well, I’ll need all the hours I can get.” Davey said. “I’m sure I’ll get a day or two off every couple of weeks.” “Yes, well, don’t wear yourself out.” Pete said, making a point to draw attention to his left hand. It was missing the two middle fingers. He’d lost them in an accident at a job site when he’d made a stupid mistake because he was working too long and had gotten too tired. “That heavy machinery will suck in a hand, or your arm and chop it right off without a second thought.” “I know, Papa.” Davey said in a long drawl, but there was a look in the back of his eyes that said Pete’s warning had reminded him that bad things could happen. When everyone had finished dinner, we moved into the family room. Monta served coffee for herself, Pete, and Dad. Mom and Davey’s mom were drinking hot tea while Davey and I were having water. Jenny had gone to her friend’s house, and Shantill was on the phone with one of her male friends. The conversation had started casually, with Sandy talking about the house in Ceres that they had applied for earlier that day. “Oh my, it’s time for the drawing!” Monta exclaimed when she noticed the time. She got up and went over to the big screen television, turning it on and changing the channel. “I swear you waste more money on that than I care to imagine!” Pete grumbled before turning to my father. “Both her and Sandy like to play that Lotto junk!” “That reminds me!” Mom said with a slight smile as she dug into her purse. She took out the card we’d signed earlier and that she’d sealed in the car. “Sandy, we are so glad you’re feeling better. We got you this card.” “Thank you, Brenda.” Sandy said with a smile as she opened the envelop just as the lottery drawing came on television. She opened the card as the third ball popped up and the number was called. A slip of paper fell out of the opened card and she bent to pick it up. “A lottery ticket!” “Yes, Davey mentioned how you like to play.” Mom said with a disingenuous smile while Davey gave me a suddenly suspicious look while the fourth ball popped up with its number. “Would you look at that, it’s got all four numbers!” Sandy exclaimed, suddenly on the edge of her seat and looking between the ticket and the television with excitement. “I’ve got none!” Monta called out as she came flying out of her Lazyboy chair to look over Sandy’s shoulder at the lottery ticket. When the fifth number appeared, she started jumping up and down. “That’s five!” “Oh my.” Sandy Jones said softly as the final number appeared on the screen, just as I remembered from another timeline. Sandy and my mother had both bought tickets to that drawing, and I’d joined that timeline’s Davey in teasing them after they’d lost. This time though, Sandy Jones had just won nine million dollars, and was screaming her head off while her son gave me a look filled with suspicion. Chapter 14 “Why’d you do it?” Davey asked me yet again as we stood looking out the window of his bedroom. Below us, his sister and her two friends were hanging over the railing of the back porch, looking at the river churning in the small canyon below. The room was empty, because we were officially just ‘looking’ at the place while his mother contemplated buying the house with her new wealth. “Davey…” I started to say but he shook his head and looked at me with sad eyes. He’d barely spoken to me for the last three weeks, and part of me couldn’t blame him too much for that. “No, Brian.” He said softly. “You didn’t even ask me what I thought. You just did it. What about those people that won the lottery the week after? We took money from them. They were supposed to win all of what Mom got.” “They still won three million.” I said with a sigh. “That’s still a lot of damn money.” “But it’s wrong that you took it away from them and gave it to my mom.” Davey said again, repeating the same thing he’d said last time. “Things would have worked out, you know. I had that job at the cannery and now Mom won’t even let me think about working. She wants me to study and do sports and all that stuff. That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” I answered honestly and he frowned, not expecting me to be so blunt. “That is exactly what I wanted, Davey Jones. I wanted you to be able to concentrate on school, on learning the things to get into a good school where you’ll study the things you need – that we need for the future.” “You did it so I could follow the damn path you’ve laid out for me in your head.” Davey snarled with a look of anger. “I thought you wanted to help me, to help make things better in this world.” I said softly and he frowned. “I do, but I don’t want to cheat in order to do it.” He said in a much softer tone. “Davey, I learned a lot of things in my last life.” I said gently, catching his blue eyes in mine and holding them. It struck me again how his eyes were blue, like mine, but a different shade, and they practically glittered with his emotions at this age in a way that they almost never did in the last timeline. There was still true innocence there, innocence long since gone by the time I’d ever met him. “One of the things I’ve learned is that sometimes you have to take what you need, even if it causes some harm to others. In this case, yes, what I did took money from people who would have gotten more otherwise. Still, they won, and they won a decent amount. Maybe they won’t be able to waste as much of it as they did in the last timeline, but they still got a lot of money. What your family got from it is going to be used to do a lot more than they ever would have done. With it, we’re going to change the world, make it a better place.” “But how does that justify it?” Davey asked. “How can we say we’re good people if we stole that money?” “Davey, I remember the numbers for four lottery drawings in my life.” I said after taking a deep breath. It was time for him to hear this part of my plan. “In five more years, there’s going to be a drawing worth over twenty times what your mother won. We’re going to win that one too.” “Why?” He asked with narrowed eyes and suspicion in his tone. “Because the world doesn’t run on good intentions.” I said with a hint of bitterness in my voice as I looked out the window again. It was strange, I’d had nothing to do with picking this house, but like in the last timeline, Pete had picked it out for Sandy, and she had fallen in love with it at first sight. I was certain she’d buy it, and it was in the Downey district. Even Jenny wasn’t complaining about having to leave Ceres, although she was talking about getting a transfer to let her stay in Ceres High, which was almost certain. She’d have a license soon, and her mother now had plenty of money to get her a car of her own. “What do you mean?” Davey asked me and I sighed. “In the last timeline, your father ran for President, twice, and he won both times.” I said softly and he made a snort. “Yeah, you told me about that.” He said with a hint of scorn. “It won’t happen this time, though. No one is going to vote for a convicted child molester.” “No, you’re right, it won’t happen, but that’s not my point.” I said patiently. “How much do you think he spent on those two campaigns?” “A lot.” Davey said quietly. “Millions of dollars, probably.” “The two campaigns totaled over five hundred million dollars.” I told him and looked back to see his eyes widening and he made a slight coughing noise. “Yeah, your father had to raise half a billion dollars to get, and keep the Presidency. All of his campaigns in total probably came to nearly a billion dollars. Think about that Davey. In the decades after his Presidency, he was widely acknowledged as one of the best presidents in our country’s history. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, not once, not twice, but four times. His acts as President, and later, changed the course of history for this country, and our world. I remember our grandchildren coming home from school, laughing and reading the entry on him from their history books.” “That’s still hard to believe.” Davey said with a whisper and wet eyes. “I can’t believe my father would be so… good.” “But he didn’t become President because he was a good man.” I pushed on. “Sure, that’s part of what got him in office, and made him the great President he was, but this world is as full of good men like your father as it is full of bad, stupid men. Without having the ability to raise that billion dollars for his campaigns, your father might have never been more than a preacher, or a truck driver. In order to change the world, he had to have money to do it. Think about it though, because he took a billion dollars people gave to him, and because of his policies, billions of people lived better lives, and many made more money than they would have otherwise. That billion spent on him yielded results that can never be measured.” “Does it matter?” Davey asked bitterly. “That’s all gone now, destroyed by your time traveling.” “Yes, it does matter.” I said with a sigh. “You may not remember them, no one may remember all those people, but it doesn’t change the fact that they existed or that they had better lives.” “What you’re saying is that it takes money to make things change, to make the world a better place like you want to do, and we have to have that money.” Davey summarized and I smiled while nodding my agreement. “Nine million paid out over twenty years won’t do all that much.” Davey said softly. “No, but a couple hundred million, well around a hundred million after taxes and all that will be enough seed money to make a start.” I said and he nodded. “There are other things, like certain timely investments, that will take that money and turn it into something close to what your father raised for his campaigns.” “So in order to do the good you want to do, we have to take money from others.” Davey said succinctly. “What do most people do when they win the lottery?” “Pay off their bills, quit their jobs, and spend it on themselves or their family, maybe some family friends.” I said with a shrug. “We’re going to do more than that though. You and I, if you want, we will change this world like your father did, although I hope to make it last longer than he did.” “How did he fail to do that?” Davey asked and I smiled. “Cult of personality.” I answered and he frowned. “Huh?” He stated. “It’s something I first learned in college.” I said with a shrug. “Okay, maybe I heard Davey and his father talking about it in high school, but they were discussing Ronald Reagan. But, when I learned it in college was when Davey and I first really started discussing it in the context of our national political history.” “So you’re saying I need to go to school to learn about this?” Davey asked with a slight chuckle. “Yes.” I answered him honestly and he nodded. “I still don’t like it.” He sighed. “You don’t have to like it.” I said with a shrug. “Most of the time I don’t like it either, taking money from people like this, but it is necessary.” “How did you get so… jaded?” Davey asked and I had to laugh. “I’m not jaded compared to some people.” I shrugged and he gave me that look that I now knew to mean he was thinking about time travel. “How did I get so jaded?” He asked softly. “You already know the answer to that.” I replied and he stared at me for a long moment before nodding slowly. “Oh, good, you’re both up here.” Sandy Jones said from the doorway to Davey’s room. My mother was right behind her, and both of them were smiling. “What do you think, Davey? Is this place good enough?” “I love it Mom.” Davey said with a gentle smile. “It’s like we were meant to live here.” That bastard! He said that on purpose, since I’d already told him the history of the house in the last timeline. It was all I could do to not burst out in laughter. “What do you think Brian?” She asked and I had to take a deep breath before answering. “I like it a lot.” I answered her. “Good, then I’ll let Dad haggle with the realtor and get the price down a bit.” She said before turning and walking away with a determined stride. “She’s happy.” Davey smiled softly. “No matter what else, this is making her happy, and your mother… why did they turn down half the money?” “We don’t need millions of dollars.” I said with a shrug. “Besides, our moms are talking about going into business together and your mom is providing most of the start-up funds for that.” “True.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “If I didn’t believe you already, I’d believe you came from the future now. Wait, I just thought of something. You said the timeline was already changing. Aren’t you worried the cumulative effects of the changes you’re making will change the lottery numbers of that big jackpot you want to win?” “Nope.” I answered confidently. “Why not?” He asked. “I don’t understand the physics myself, and I know you’re not much on the mathematics.” I semi-answered and he frowned, but didn’t protest. It was true, even after a hundred years of life, Davey was mediocre at best with math. “What it comes down to is that changes can effect the world in a lot of ways, but certain events are largely unchanged unless there’s something really massive that happens. Random events, like the random drawing of the lottery numbers stays random. If you want to change them, your best bet would be to change things so the lottery is outlawed and the drawing never held, for example.” “Or start World War Three and get everything nuked.” Davey said with a slow nod of his head and I nodded my agreement. “Yep, like that.” I agreed. “In some weird way it makes sense.” Davey said with a smile. “So, did I hear right, that the last game of the baseball season is this weekend?” “Yeah.” I answered the question easily. He often did that, totally change tracks when he felt a particular topic had been fully discussed. “I think I’ll go.” Davey said and I laughed.",

I was surprised though when he got a pensive look on his face. “Brian, can I ask you something?” “Sure.” I said casually, but there was a sudden tightening in my gut. That look on his face meant he was thinking of something unpleasant. “You’re from a future, but you say the future isn’t set in stone.” Davey said slowly as though he was thinking aloud more than anything. “Some things will be the same, but other things will be different, right? That’s how… that is how you can plan to make some changes, to make the world a better place.” “That’s right.” I said softly. “But you can’t guarantee it will work.” Davey continued his thought process aloud. “You mentioned how one of the other timelines the other me created, it ended in nuclear war, which was when they created the timeline you came from.” “You got it correct.” I confirmed for him. “The same thing could happen here, if we’re not careful, although it’s pretty late in the timeline for something like that. It was other time travelers that really precipitated that war, and their attempt to control the secrets of time travel. That secret’s dead now. I don’t know nearly enough to make another machine. In a couple of years, the Soviet Union will cease to exist, and while there’s still threats of a city being blown up, or minor stuff like that, it’ll be decades before China gets close enough to having the technology to instigate a war that could threaten the entire planet.” “Yeah, but doesn’t that mean that you can’t absolutely predict certain things?” Davey asked slowly. “You can’t tell me my mom will live to be an old woman, or that my sister won’t die in a car accident, or even that you or I won’t die in an accident.” “Life would be kind of boring if we knew everything that was going to happen, wouldn’t it?” I asked him and he chuckled softly. “Uh huh, but really, Brian, what makes us any better suited to changing the world?” Davey asked me in a quiet voice. “Anything can happen, right? How do we know we’ll be happy, and that we’ll do what we set out to do?” “Right now the Governor of Arkansas is biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to go after his lifelong dream of becoming President.” I said in a firm, but quiet voice. “He’s going to win in 1992, ending twelve years of Republican rule from the White House. There’s many things he will want to do in office and while he’s President, this country – and the world will change from the Cold War era into a new era. He’ll succeed at a lot of things while in office, and fail at others, but in the end his most memorable feat in office will be that he was impeached because he lied about getting a blow job from an intern.” “You’re kidding!” Davey’s voice cracked and his eyes were wide. “Nope.” I said smugly. “Well, that’s what he’ll be remembered for if he doesn’t get some good advice and follow it while he’s President. Still, the guy’s been dreaming since he met John F. Kennedy that he would one day be President, and he’ll succeed, but he’ll be remembered for being impeached over a lie, more than anything else.” “What does that have to do with…” Davey’s voice drifted off while I smiled. “It means I don’t know if we’ll succeed, but I know we should try, and I know that we should be careful not to get tripped up by stupid things along the way.” I answered. “I also believe that if Bill Clinton didn’t run in 1992, we might have been worse off than we were with him in office. The bottom line is that we have to try, and no, we’re not guaranteed to win, but if we don’t try, there will be no chance that things are better. I can’t promise you anything, except that I’ll always love you, and I’ll always be there for you.” “Unless you die in a car accident.” Davey pointed out and I had to nod. “Well, I’ll just have to make sure that if you are in an accident, I’m there with you so I won’t have to see what happens without you around.” “I…” I lost my voice at that and he smiled before stepping closer to me and kissing me on the lips. “We better go see what Mom’s up to.” He said with an impish grin before walking out. I followed him, thoroughly confused about the whole point of all this talking, but decided to just stop worrying and see what was in store for me. “This will make a great office for the both of us.” Davey’s mother was saying to my mother as we found them standing in front of the room that I had always thought of as President Jones’s private office. For some reason her words sent a pang of regret through me. I still had not met the man in this timeline, and part of me didn’t want to meet him. “If you think so, Sandy.” Mom answered with a grin. “This house is wonderful, and it is so close to ours.” “Good, then it’ll be easy for us to get together here.” Mom said as Pete came around the corner with the realtor trailing behind him. “You sure you want this place?” Pete asked Sandy who nodded. I knew it was an act on Pete’s part as he sighed before turning to the realtor. “If she’s so set on the place, I guess we’ll take it, but we’re not paying a dime over four-twenty.” “I’ll have to talk to the seller, but I think he’ll agree.” The realtor said with a slightly oily smile. That was a good thirty thousand less than the asking price, so Pete must have done some good bargaining, but it looked like the deal was made. “We’d better get heading back.” Pete said. “Mom should be home with the baby by now.” “Let’s go.” Sandy said before calling out for her daughter. Sandy and Mom took Sandy’s RX-7, while I got to drive Davey and the girls back and Pete took his own van back to Ceres. “Can we stop at Foster’s Freeze on the way?” Jenny asked petulantly as we neared Ceres. Her and her friends had done nothing but chatter away the entire time, while Davey and I had pretty much remained silent. “Sure.” I said with a sigh. She was always wanting something extra, no matter what we did, and as I expected, it was Davey who paid for the slushies at the Foster’s Freeze. We got back to Pete and Monta’s house just in time to see a strange man get out of his car, wearing a suit, and walk up to Sandy, who was standing in the driveway talking to Pete and my mother. “Who’s that?” Jenny asked as I parked and we got out of the car just in time to hear Sandy start shouting at the man, who walked away quickly, holding a clipboard and shaking his head. Davey rushed forward to his mother’s side. “What’s wrong?” He asked her. “Your good-for-nothing father!” Pete snapped while Sandy held out a packet of papers to Davey. “The bastard is suing me!” Sandy snarled angrily. “What?” Jenny half-screeched. “Why?” Davey asked as he took the papers and started riffling through them. I looked over his shoulder and read that Sandy was being sued by her estranged husband for half of the lottery money. “Just because I haven’t gotten around to divorcing him yet he’s saying he deserves half of my money!” Sandy half-yelled, but she was near hysterical as my mother put a comforting arm around her. She turned and started crying into Mom’s shoulder. “He can’t do this.” Davey snarled angrily as he shoved the papers at his grandfather who was giving him a stern gaze. “Davey, don’t do…” Pete started to say, but Davey wasn’t listening. Instead, Davey was storming away, half-running down the street. With a glance at Mom I started after him. “Davey…” I called out when I got close to him, halfway to his other grandmother’s house. She lived right around the corner, and it was a very short distance. “Don’t try to stop me.” Davey fumed without slowing down as I pulled abreast of him. “I’m not going to do that.” I said firmly. “Still, let’s walk, okay?” “Why?” He asked. “So you have a few extra minutes to think about what you’re going to say instead of just spouting off at him.” I answered. He stopped suddenly and gave me a long look. “You’re not going to try to stop me?” He asked. “No.” I answered simply. “I’ve got your back. This is wrong of him to try to do this.” “Oh.” Davey said softly and then cocked his head as he looked at me. “What do you think I should say?” “I don’t know.” I shrugged. “The man I knew would never do something like this, so you know him better than me. Plus, I always like to think things through before I do something. You’re the one who things on his feet really well, as long as you take a few minutes to run things through your head first. Me, I’d take a day or two to get something half as decent as what you can put together in a few minutes.” “Okay.” Davey said with a curt nod of his head. “He’s doing this because… well because money has always been tight for grandma. He’s living there with her, Aunt Bev, Ron, and Bryan, and he’s having to work at McDonald’s, which I know he hates. He thinks it’s beneath him. Mom’s got this huge pile of money, and if she shared it with him, he’d not have to do that.” “Do you think he’s even talked to her?” I asked Davey and he nodded. “She told him no way in hell was he touching any of her money.” Davey answered. “What can you do?” I asked him and he took a deep breath. “He loves me.” Davey said softly. “Dad hates the fact that we don’t get along like we used to, and that I hardly ever go visit him.” “That’s not your fault.” I affirmed and he shook his head. “That still doesn’t change the fact that he misses that.” Davey said. “Okay, I think I know what I’m going to say.” “Good.” I said as he started walking, but he stopped again and turned to look at me with a little smile on his face. “Thanks.” He said quietly. “You’re welcome.” I replied with a return smile. “It’s… I know we don’t talk about… about being in a relationship a lot, mostly because it makes you uncomfortable, but this is what I want. I want us to be able to depend on each other for advice, and to help each other out.” “I… I think I could get use to this.” Davey said with a husky voice and he squeezed my arm once before turning to walk towards his grandmother’s. “You coming?” “I’m right behind you.” I said affectionately and he chuckled. Soon enough we were walking up the driveway to his grandmother’s. Her old white and brown Chrysler was parked on the right of the driveway, while an ugly brown van was parked on the left and a boat was in the grassy area next to the left side of the driveway. The little red 1979 Toyota pickup that Davey’s father had bought years ago from Pete was parked on the side of the road in front of the house. It seemed everyone was home. “Davey!” Davey’s paternal grandmother nearly shouted when she answered his knock on the door. “What a surprise! Oh look at you!” “Hi Grandma.” Davey said as the woman pulled him into a tight hug. She was shorter than him, and looked a lot younger than the last time I’d seen her in 2007. “Is Dad home?” “DAVID!” She shouted before releasing Davey. “Oh Davey! We haven’t seen you in weeks! What have you been up to? Who is this?” “Grandma, this is my friend Brian.” Davey said politely. “Brian, this is my grandma.” “It’s nice to meet a friend of Davey’s.” She said excitedly to me. “You boys come on inside and let me fix you something to eat!” “I’m just here to talk to my father.” Davey said firmly, letting his anger show a bit and she frowned immediately. “It’s about your mother, isn’t it?” She said sourly. “She got her papers today. Well, if that’s what it takes to bring you over here, I say your father should sue her every damn day! I swear, that woman! First she ruins our family, airing our dirty laundry for everyone to see and then she goes and wins the lottery and refuses to share the money like a good wife should! If I had that bitch in front of me right now I’d…” “Stop it.” Davey growled and she frowned at him. “Well, if that’s the way you’re going to talk to me, your grandmother, I don’t want you coming inside this house!” She snarled and stepped back as the sound of footsteps could be heard coming down the hallway. Davey’s father appeared behind her, his hair still wet from the shower he must have been taking when we showed up. “Davey!” He said with excitement and a broad grin while I took in the differences between this man and the one I remembered from another time. This David Jones Sr. was overweight, and had a bushy mustache that he’d never worn in the time I’d known him in that other timeline. “I need to talk to you.” Davey said firmly, ignoring his grandmother’s noises of distaste and staring at his father. His entire body was tense. “Who is this?” His father asked, nodding in my direction. “This is my best friend, Brian.” Davey answered. “Can we talk out here?” “Uh, sure.” His father said as Davey and I took a few steps back and down so we were off of the front porch. As he stepped outside he turned to his mother. “I’ll be just a few minutes, mother.” “You put him in his place, David!” She snarled before slamming the door behind him. He shook his head and turned to look at Davey. “I take it your mother was served?” He asked and Davey nodded. “You want to talk about this in front of him?” “He and his parents bought Mom the winning lottery ticket as a gift.” Davey said through gritted teeth as he stared his father down. “His family let us use their apartment in the city when Mom was going through her surgery. I’ve stayed at his place for the last few months, and his mother his going into business with Mom. As far as I’m concerned he’s a part of my family.” “I see.” David Jones Sr. said as he gave me an appraising look. “I appreciate everything your family has done for my son and my wife.” “She’s only your wife because she hasn’t gotten the nerve up yet to actually file for divorce.” Davey snarled. “Maybe now you’ve finally pushed her far enough she’ll file the damn paperwork.” “Watch your language young man!” Davey’s father snapped at him. “You’re still my son!” “You may have sired me, but you’ve long since given up any right to be a part of my family.” Davey shot back angrily. “Only because your mother refused to…” David Jones started to say, but Davey cut him off. “She refused to forget what you did to Jenny, how you did what no father should ever to do to his daughter, and she refuses to live a lie just so you can save face.” Davey shot back. “We were married before God, and you can’t just turn your back on that when things don’t go right.” His father retorted. “This is a little beyond ‘irreconcilable differences.” Davey snorted. “You don’t deserve her.” “How dare you say that?” Davey’s father nearly shouted as his face turned purple. “I don’t know how you think you can talk to an adult, much less your father that way but I won’t stand for it!” “I can talk to you this way because you’ve long since lost any right to deal with me as a parent to his child.” Davey’s voice dropped an octave and his hands balled up into a fist. “When you touched my sister the way you did, you gave up any and all rights to deal with me as a parent. The most you can ever hope for is that one day I’ll be ready to forgive you and we might develop a relationship as adults. When you did what you did to Jenny, you did more than just molest her. You destroyed our family. You forced Mom to make decisions no wife or mother should ever have to make, and you forced me to assume the responsibilities of an adult. Or have you forgotten that it has been me, not you, whose been paying the bills for Jenny’s psychotherapist?” “I haven’t… you can’t blame me that no one will hire me after it was in all the papers…” His father said weakly. “Now you try to take what Mom has luckily been given thanks to Brian and his parents?” Davey continued in that low, vicious tone. “Is that how you plan to prove to me that you’re worthy of being a part of my life?” “What?” David Jones Sr. asked with real confusion in his eyes. “You do want to earn my approval, my respect, and maybe have some reconciliation with me and Jenny, don’t you?” Davey asked calmly. “Of course I do…” His father replied, but stopped as Davey stared at him silently. “Is this the best way to do it?” Davey asked him and the older man stared at his son for a long time. “When did you get so wise?” David Jones asked his son. “I did listen, you know.” His son stated in a voice that was void of the anger that had been there earlier. It was still quiet, but there was a softness to it that had not been evident until now. The older man’s head jerked up a bit and he gave his son a quizzical look. “When you were preaching. I listened. When I was younger, I remember you preaching about Jesus and how he acted when the Roman soldiers came to arrest him. Remember in Waterford when Sampson was beating me up? I could have fought back anytime, I could have pummeled him, but I didn’t because I remembered you teaching how violence was not the answer according to Jesus.” “You did fight him eventually, and you won.” David Sr. said with a slight smile while I stared in surprise at Davey. I’d never heard this story before. “You and he were the best of friends for a long time, until we moved back to Modesto.” “Yes, but I didn’t fight him until he hit April.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. “He’s in Modesto now.” David Sr. said calmly. “I saw him the other day. His parents moved to Modesto last year.” “Oh.” Davey said softly before shaking his head. “My point, Dad, is that I did listen to your sermons. There was a lot of good in them, and I’m a better person for having listened to them. When… when we came back and I was old enough to work, I got a job so we could afford Jenny’s sessions. No, don’t look like that. This is not an attack on you for not being able to pay for it. I do understand why you couldn’t, but because of what I learned from your sermons I didn’t hesitate to do the right thing when it was needed.” “I… I can’t say how proud of you I am for that.” His father said in a quiet tone and Davey cocked his head to the side while looking at his father. “Then why don’t you practice what you use to preach?” He asked his father and the older man flinched before frowning. “I… I… you don’t understand.” David Sr. replied softly. “Your grandmother’s had to take a second mortgage out on the house because of the legal bills, and Bev’s medical bills. Your Aunt was in the hospital for a few weeks there, you know.” “No, I didn’t, and I should have.” Davey said softly. “She’d like to see you.” David Sr. said softly. “Maybe I will, before I leave.” Davey said quietly. “Still, does any of that justify you doing this to Mom?” “I… no, it doesn’t.” David Sr. said softly. “It’s just… you know how your grandmother can be.” “Yes, but that doesn’t justify you giving in to her.” Davey said firmly. “I have to live here, damn it!” His father snapped and Davey did look sympathetic for a moment. “I’d be ready to kill her if I had to live here for more than a few months.” Davey snorted and his father chuckled softly. “Look, Dad, I didn’t know about the mortgage and all that. Maybe I can talk Mom into helping with that. She loves Bev still, you know.” “I know.” Dad sighed. “Sometimes I feel guilty because the two of them have been friends since high school and now Sandy can’t even talk to her on the phone.” “Dad, you don’t deserve half the money, but Mom won’t ignore a real need over here like this.” Davey said in a quiet but firm voice. “Let me talk to her, give me some time.” “Okay, son.” David Sr. said with a sigh. “Your grandmother might kill me, but I’ll drop the suit.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Now, why don’t you come and say hello to your aunt?” His father asked. “Brian, you’re going to love my Aunt Bev.” Davey said with a bright smile as he turned to me. “Just be careful or she’ll run you over with her wheelchair.” “Okay.” I said with a smile of my own while my feet winced in remembered pain. Okay, maybe these feet didn’t remember the pain of her wheelchair running over them, but I did have those memories, and the woman could be quite vicious when she wanted to make a point. Chapter 15 It was amazing what a simple apology could do. Some people have made a science of apologizing, both now and in the future. Certainly for anyone in the public spotlight knowing how to give the correct apology at the correct time was an important thing to know. Sometimes a bouquet of flowers with a simple note saying “I’m Sorry” would heal over a spat between lovers. It could be a box of chocolates, or a special trip including a favorite activity of the person being apologized to would work. Other times, giving a good apology required a complicated series of events, or endless repetition. There were people who didn’t want to hear a simple “I’m Sorry.” They want to hear you explain why you’re sorry, and what you did wrong first, and then the words. Still others wouldn’t listen to any apology at all, but rather required a long series of actions before they would accept the apology. David Jones Sr. had a lot to apologize for in this timeline, and he had a lot of people to whom he needed to apologize. Each of them required a different style of approach, a different form of apology, and none of them were inclined to forgive him anytime soon. The little stunt with the aborted attempt to get some of Sandy’s lottery money had only made the hurdles higher, and I was both surprised and pleased when he started making overtures right away. The next Saturday after Davey confronted him, he walked over to Pete and Monta’s house. Dad and I had been invited by Pete to join him and Davey on a fishing trip. It had been a good trip, and we’d come back in the late afternoon with the legal limit of fish. Davey’s father showed up just as we finished unloading the van, and Pete tensed up, as did Davey, but it was Davey who went to confront his father while Pete watched warily. “What do you want?” Davey asked sternly. “I… I would like to speak to your mother.” David Sr. said in a cautious voice. “Why?” Davey’s voice dripped with suspicion. “These are the official papers dropping the lawsuit.” His father answered while holding up a sheaf of papers in his hands. “I’ve also got papers filed for starting the divorce proceedings, if she wants. This way she doesn’t have to pay for anything.” “Okay.” Davey said with a hint of anger in his voice and he turned back to look at his grandfather who stared at the two of them for a long moment before nodding. “I’ll go get her.” Pete said gruffly and walked into the house. Sandy came out a few minutes later with an apprehensive look on her face. “Pete says you have something for me, Dave.” She said frostily and her husband handed over one set of papers. “Here’s the papers dropping the suit.” He said to her. “It was wrong of me to file them. I have no right to any of that, and I’m sorry.” “You’re damn right you have no right.” Sandy snarled, but she also relaxed a bit as she took the papers. “What made you do it?” “My mother.” He said with a heavy sigh and she actually laughed briefly before shaking her head. “That doesn’t make me any less responsible. I’m the one who did it, even if she was pushing me. It’s my responsibility.” “It’s about damn time you took responsibility for your mistakes.” Pete grumbled from where he stood behind Sandy. David Jones Sr. just nodded, agreeing with Pete and forcing a look of surprise to the older man’s face. “I… I also have papers here to start the proceedings for a divorce.” David Sr. said and Sandy gasped slightly. “You want a divorce?” She said in a voice that sounded horrified. “No, I don’t, but you might.” He said softly. “I’ve made so many mistakes, done so many things wrong I can’t blame you if you want one, but I know that before you couldn’t afford one. You can now, but I am the one who’s brought us to this point in our relationship, I’m the one who destroyed our family, and I’m the one who should take this step, or at least offer it to you if it is what you want. You’ve done nothing wrong. In fact, you’ve been doing things right, the way I should have. You’ve put the needs of the kids first, and put a stop to–to the things that I was doing that were wrong.” “I… put those away.” Sandy said to him with a weak voice. “I’m not saying I won’t want a divorce, but not right now. You’ve never… you’ve never accepted responsibility for what you did before. Your daughter needs to hear you say that.” “She will, whenever you and she are ready.” He replied in a voice that shook only a little bit. “Thank you, Dave.” She said in a quiet, but clear dismissal. “You deserve it, and more.” He said before turning to go. He took two steps before stopping and turning back. “Sandy, I almost forgot. Bev wanted me to say she misses you and Jenny. Would it be okay for her to come and visit?” “Anytime.” Sandy replied evenly and he nodded before resuming his course back to his mother’s house. When he was out of sight, Sandy turned and buried her head against Davey’s chest while she shook with her sobs. Dad touched my shoulder and nodded towards the house. I followed him and Pete inside while Davey comforted his mother. As spring turned into summer, that day marked a turning point for Davey and his family. It took another three weeks for them to move into the new house. During that time, Davey would stay with us during the week, and my room often reeked of the sex we would have in there at night, but on Friday night he’d go back to Pete and Monta’s house and not return until Sunday night. I found that I was okay with that, because it gave me time to rebuild my friendship with Brandon and Trevor, as well as to continue getting to know Todd better. The weekend where Sandy, Davey, and Jenny moved into their new home saw all of us showing up to help out with the move. Sandy had bought a bunch of new furniture for the house, and had spent the last few weeks totally revamping not only her wardrobe, but her childrens’ as well. Davey looked quite good in the matching outfits she bought for him, as did Jenny. To my surprise, David Sr. was also there, helping out with the move, as were Bev’s son Bryan and Bev herself – although she spent much of the time in her wheelchair directing everyone where to put things. When our Junior year of high school ended, Davey had a big party at his house with most of his friends, and several of mine. Sandy wasn’t there that weekend, and Davey shocked me when he told me that she was in San Francisco for the weekend with his father. I knew that they had started going to counseling with Jenny’s therapist as a family, but I hadn’t known things were going in the direction of his parents getting back together. I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but both Davey and his sister seemed to be happy with that development. In July, Davey got to spend two weeks with Brandon, Trevor, and me at a football camp in Minnesota. At first he was the worst player at the camp, but by the end of the two weeks, he had progressed so far that I was confident he’d make first string on the Varsity team at school. We made a good team on defense together, and while I knew he’d never been into baseball the way it was in the last timeline, I could see the abilities that had made him a good player shining through with some concentrated training and attention. It was a few days after we got back from football camp that things changed yet again. His mother had bought some excellent weight equipment and put it on their spacious back patio just like in the last timeline. Three days a week, I’d go over and we’d work out together. Most of the time, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd would meet up with us as well, and we’d go out for milkshakes or just hang out after the workout. That day, it was just the two of us until Todd opened the sliding glass door and walked out on the patio, followed by a familiar face. “Hey!” Davey called happily from where he stood spotting me on the bench press. While I put the bar back on its rest, he crossed over to meet Todd and hug him tightly. “We didn’t think you were coming!” “I had a guest come over.” Todd said and stood out of the way as I stood up and went to stand by them. “Davey, you might remember Sean from La Loma.” “Oh, yeah, hey Sean!” Davey said with a genuine smile as he held out his hand. Sean looked uncomfortable, but shook Davey’s hand. “I haven’t seen you since before we moved to Nevada. How ya doing?” “I’m okay.” Sean mumbled before looking at me with a look that wasn’t exactly pleasant. “Sean, do you know Brian?” Todd asked and Sean hung his head slightly. “Yeah.” He mumbled. “Hi Sean.” I said as cheerfully as I could. He looked so young. While he wasn’t as tall as I seemed to remember him being in the last timeline, he was still taller than he had been our freshman year. His face was paler though, far more freckled, and he had almost no muscle on him at all. In fact, he was as slender as a bean pole. “Hi.” Sean mumbled back. “I think I owe you an apology.” I said in as soft a voice as I could. Davey looked at me sharply while Todd nodded politely and Sean looked at me with bewilderment. “What do you mean?” Sean mumbled in confusion. “Back in Freshman year, you got stuffed in a trashcan at school.” I stated carefully, mostly because “I” had not been there, but the “me” of this timeline had been there. “I didn’t stop it from happening, and that was wrong. No one should be treated like that.” “Oh man, I’d forgotten about that.” Davey said sympathetically and he looked back at Sean. “Sean, I am so sorry I didn’t do anything to stop it either. Brian’s right, that was wrong of us.” “I deserved it.” Sean mumbled. “You don’t have to apologize to me.” “Bullshit.” Todd snorted. “No Sean, you’re wrong.” I said firmly. “No one deserves to be treated like that, and I hope that one day you might be able to forgive us for that. I just hope we can be friends from now on.” “You don’t want to be friends with me.” Sean mumbled and then he looked angrily at Todd. “You brought me here on purpose, didn’t you? You set me up.” “Hold on, Sean.” Davey said as the smaller guy started to walk away. Davey went up to him and put his hand on Sean’s shoulder. The guy flinched at that, but he stopped and turned around. “What?” Sean snapped angrily. “Why do you think you deserved what happened back then?” Davey asked him calmly and Sean’s shoulders slumped. “You’ll probably hear about it anyway.” Sean mumbled and then hung his head, probably trying to hide the tear that dripped down his cheek. “Dad already warned the pastor at the church and he told the youth pastor so by the time school starts everyone will know. I’m queer.” “So?” Davey asked in a voice that didn’t sound anything but confused. Sean had stiffened as he said the last part, and now he was staring at Davey in total confusion. “So, I’m a fag.” Sean snapped angrily. “I’m a fudgepacker. They’ve sent me to all sorts of quacks to make me straight but it doesn’t fucking work!” “Of course it doesn’t work.” Davey shrugged. “If you’re gay, you’re gay. Shame on those quacks taking your parents’ money for something they can’t change.” “Then again maybe his parents deserve to lose their money like that for trying to make him change.” I added and now Sean was staring at both of us with wide eyes while Todd practically split his face in two with his smile. “I… you… you’re all crazy!” Sean exclaimed. “I told you that you’d be better off back here in Modesto.” Todd said with an I-told-you-so expression on his face. “What are your friends going to say if they see you hanging around me?” Sean muttered. “You don’t even know me!” “We used to know you years ago, Sean.” I said in a gentle tone. “You were a good guy back then, and I’d be downright shocked if you weren’t still a good guy. If any of our friends have a problem with you, they have a problem with us and aren’t worth being our friends.” “Brian’s right.” Davey said firmly before looking back at me with a smile. “You think we’re done, Brian? I could use a milkshake. It’s getting hot. Then maybe we could come back and go for a swim.” “I don’t have any money for a milkshake.” Sean said. “It’s on me.” Davey said firmly. “I was your friend back in Freshman year and I totally dropped the ball on being a good friend back then. I’ve got a lot of making up to do for that.” “I don’t have a swimsuit.” Sean mumbled. “Then I’ll get you one on the way back.” I said firmly. “It’s the least I can do…” “You don’t have to do this.” Sean mumbled. “No, we don’t, but we want to do this.” I said firmly. He just shook his head, which Davey and I took as consent. When we got to the Snowy’s that made the best milkshakes in town, Sean had started to come out of his shell just a bit. I wasn’t surprised to see Brandon and Trevor there, and when they came over to join us, Sean started to go back into his shell a bit. Trevor didn’t remember him at all, but there was something in Brandon’s eyes that told me he remembered Sean. My two oldest friends joined us in heading back to Davey’s pool, even stopping at the sporting goods store to get Sean a set of swimming trunks. To my surprise, Brandon had whispered something to Trevor while we were walking into the store, and the two of them came up to Sean and apologized to him for the incident in Freshman year. Then they both pitched in for Sean’s swimsuit. “I can’t wear this!” Sean muttered as he looked at the dark green Speedo that Brandon was holding up for him. “Dude, it’d look good on you.” Brandon insisted and I caught the look in his eyes. So did Davey, who gave me a little smile while Sean continued to protest. “We all should get Speedos.” Todd suggested with a bright grin as he looked at Trevor. Oh yeah, I knew what the red head was thinking, wanting to see the school’s star quarterback in a Speedo. “Okay.” Davey said with a leer of his own. “No way.” Sean protested weakly, but his eyes almost bugged out as Davey held up a pair of white Speedos with red stripes on the hips. It was very difficult for me not to start drooling right then and there. Regular workouts had helped Davey shed those extra pounds and the thought of him in that was absolutely worthy of a bucket of drool. I was starting to laugh until Davey threw the white Speedos at me. “These are for you.” Davey said emphatically while pulling out another white Speedo, although this one had blue stripes. “These are for me.” “Cool.” I said while Brandon picked out a blue Speedo. We all paid for our Speedos, with Trevor having picked out a black pair and Todd a red pair that was going to clash madly with his hair. All of us pitched in for Sean’s over his continued protests. Then we set off for Davey’s house. “Let’s get changed!” Davey’s voice showed his excitement as we all rushed up to his room and started to change. Sean turned white and fled out of the room, down the hallway to the bathroom. “What’s his problem?” Brandon said in an offended tone. “He’s shy.” Todd said defensively with a warning look at Davey and me. “He’s not a jock like you guys.” “We’ll get him over that by the time summer’s out.” Brandon said confidently. When Sean reappeared with a towel wrapped around him, no one said anything. By the time we reached the pool, he was a lot calmer, and although he waited until he was next to the pool before taking off the towel and slipping into the water. At first he hung back while Davey and Brandon got into a splash war, but soon he was swimming around and playing like the rest of us. It was good to see that, as my conscience was screaming at me. Sean had been a good friend in the last timeline, and had sacrificed much over the years, as much as Davey had, if not more. He deserved to be happy now, even if he didn’t remember those times. Seeing the way Brandon reacted to him was another good thing as far as I was concerned. It was very obvious to me, and probably to Davey that Brandon was interested in Sean as more than a possible friend. Watching them dance around each other was going to be fun. The weeks that followed were as close to perfect as anything could be in life. Every day I was over at Davey’s house, and Sean was there almost constantly with Todd. Brandon was there quite a bit too, and while Trevor was still spending time with his newest girlfriend, he was there more days than not. Mom and Sandy were moving along with their Event Planning business as well. They had three clients already, and were deep in working with those people. Two of the clients were weddings, both referred by Sandy’s family members, and the third was actually a political fundraiser for a City Council candidate that my mother knew from one of the local charities she worked with. Sandy had even ‘hired’ Davey’s Aunt Bev to help with the planning and arrangements. The woman may have been confined to a wheelchair, but she was ecstatic with the work, and was over nearly every day, forcing her husband, or Davey’s father to get her ready and drive her to the house. On the phone she was a living terror to the different vendors they were using. Her quick wit, and ample vocabulary meant that anyone who didn’t perform up to her expectations got a tongue-lashing they would not soon forget. Whoever was over when she started in on someone over the phone would gather outside the office she used and listen. After she was done, she’d start in on us for giggling while she was on the phone. Like all good things, though, it eventually came to an end when Sean’s father paid a visit Davey’s mother while we were out on a day trip to Sonora. On the way back home, we’d dropped Sean off with Todd at Todd’s house, and Davey and I had gone back to his house. We’d planned on spending the night since Pete was coming by the next morning to take us fishing up in the mountains. “Davey, Brian, I need to talk to both of you now.” His mother said in a stern voice as we walked in the front door. It was obvious she was pissed about something, but we shrugged and put down the bags filled with the things we’d bought for our mothers, and Davey’s sister. She shut the door behind us as we entered the office that had been President Jones’s in another timeline. There were three desks in here, and while it was still wood-paneled, it had a much more feminine feel to it now. “What’s up, Mom?” Davey asked in a slightly nervous voice. Both Bev and my mother were in the room, and while they didn’t look happy, their looks were directed more at Sandy than at us, which made me even more confused as to what was wrong. “What do you know about that Sean boy?” She asked and everything suddenly made sense. It was with a sinking feeling in my stomach that I guessed what had happened. “We went to La Loma together, and Downey until we moved to Nevada.” Davey began after a quick look at me. “He’s a good guy.” “How do you know that?” His mother asked sharply. “Did he tell you why his family moved to Southern California? Did he tell you that he’s been seeing a therapist for years now?” “Mom, Jenny’s been seeing a therapist for years, and for that matter, we’ve been going with her!” Davey retorted hotly. “What does that have to do with Sean?” “We’ve been seeing a therapist to help your sister recover from what was done to her.” His mother shouted. “He’s seeing one because he’s the one who’s perverted! Has he tried to touch you?” “What do you mean ‘has he tried to touch me’?” Davey asked with a sharp edge to his voice and I almost winced. “We goof around all the time, but then again so does Brian and me.” “Don’t try to play coy with me!” His mom shouted while my mom turned a bright pink and tried to suppress a bark of laughter. I had a sinking feeling in my gut as Beverly looked over at her, then at Davey, and finally at me. Her direct gaze caused a slight blush to my cheeks while Sandy kept yelling at her son. “You know damn well what I mean! Has that boy tried to touch you sexually?” “Not that it’s any of your business if he had, but no, of course not.” Davey said with a snort and the room reverberated with the sound of her slapping him. “Don’t you dare talk to me like that!” His mother shouted. “His father came over and told me what a little pervert he is! You’ll have nothing to do with him any more, and I never want to see him over here again. People like him should be locked away from the rest of society…” “Sandy!” Bev shouted as my mother’s face began to grow red, not from the earlier humor but from real anger. “What is it?” Sandy snapped as Bev turned on her electric wheelchair and maneuvered herself to Sandy’s side while mother stood up. “What’s wrong with you?” Bev snapped as she hit Sandy in the side with her arm. Davey’s Aunt had been crippled from the neck down in an auto accident years ago, but she was still able to move her arms. Her hands she really couldn’t do much with, but she was deadly when she lashed out with her arms like that. “What’s that for?” Sandy growled, rubbing the spot where Bev had hit her. “How dare you talk about Sean that way!” Bev snapped. “He’s a good boy and you know that.” “I thought my husband was a good father and you see where that got me!” Sandy snapped back. “I’ll not have my son put in danger that way.” “Please tell me you don’t really feel that way.” Mom said sadly. Her anger was gone, replaced by a deep sense of sadness. “What does it matter if Sean’s gay?” “What?” Davey’s mother nearly squeaked with her surprise. “How can you say that Brenda? Homosexuals are perverts, one and all! It says so in the bible! What’s more, they’re all sick! Look at that AIDS thing! All homosexuals get AIDS and they die. If that Sean boy is a homosexual, he’ll have AIDS and I’m not going to risk my son being infected by him!” “Brian, get your things.” Mom said with a note of finality and I knew better than to argue with her right now. “What’s going on?” Sandy demanded imperiously. “I’m sorry, Sandy, but I cannot associate with someone who believes those things.” Mom said with a strong hint of sadness in her voice. “My brother Rich died of AIDS, and I will not listen to you insult his memory.” “You see!” Sandy said in a triumphant tone. “He probably got infected by homosexuals! That was his apartment, right? The one mom stayed at? He probably got it from them! Those homosexuals deserve every last bit of suffering God delivers to them.” “My Uncle Rich was the kindest, most caring person I’ve ever known.” I said through gritted teeth, remembering this woman caring for a young boy named Jeremy in another timeline. Suddenly I was homesick for that timeline, and I didn’t blame Sean one bit for not wanting to come back to this world. “I’m sure he was, but that’s what happens when you associate with homosexuals.” Sandy said. “I am ending our business relationship effective this moment.” Mom said through gritted teeth. “Why?” Sandy demanded with narrowed eyes. “Because Uncle Rich was gay, mother.” Davey said with a snort. “You can be so dense at times.” “I… um… look, I’m just overreacting.” Sandy began in an insincere apology. “Save it, Sandy.” Mom said angrily. “Right now I’m so angry nothing you can say will make a difference.” “But can’t you see that this is for the good of our boys?” Sandy asked in almost a whining tone. “We can’t have them perverted by that boy…” “Stop right there, Sandy.” Bev practically snarled, cutting off Davey’s mother who looked at her in shock. “Bev, you know that…” She started to protest. “I know that you’re not thinking, just reacting.” Bev snapped at her. “If you were thinking you’d have noticed something.” “What’s that?” Sandy snapped at her in frustration as she crossed her arms over her chest and glared at her sister-in-law sitting calmly in the wheelchair. “Doesn’t it strike you as odd that your son isn’t reacting in surprise at hearing that his friend is a homosexual, or that he knew that Brian’s uncle was one?” Bev asked and I cursed for not remembering how quick Davey’s aunt was. Sometimes I think he got the ability to think so quickly from her, instead of his mother or father. “What?” Sandy exclaimed in surprise while she turned to face her son who had gone slightly pale. “You knew about this and kept it from me?” “I… it wasn’t any of your business.” Davey said weakly and I had to flinch at the reaction on Sandy’s face. Part of me wanted to jump to his defense, but I knew this was his battle to fight, and I knew that I would not have been all too happy if either of our boys had spoken to me like that. “What do you mean it wasn’t my business?” She shouted and Davey did flinch in a major way this time. “How dare you say it isn’t my business? You’re my son and if something puts you in danger, it damn well is my business.” “I haven’t ever been in any danger, mother.” Davey said with sarcasm dripping from his voice. That did not bode well either. “Go to your room.” Sandy ordered. “I’ll deal with you later.” “No.” Davey said in firm, and flat, voice. “What do you mean no?” She demanded angrily. “You’re my son and as long as you live in my house you will do what I tell you!” “I’m seventeen, mother.” He said flatly in a voice that I knew foretold a lot of trouble. Unfortunately, his mother was so angry she probably didn’t recognize the tone. “If you want to go down this road, fine. I can leave.” “You leave this house and you’ll be cut off!” She shouted, growing flushed in the face. “Davey.” My mother said in a calm voice. Her face showed her worry. As she spoke the single word, she gathered the attention of everyone in the room. “What?” Davey asked in a harsh tone. It was obvious he was trying to not snap at her, which was a good thing. “I think everyone needs to take a deep breath.” My mother said in a slightly calm voice. “I thought you wanted nothing to do with me?” Sandy snapped waspishly at her. “I don’t, but your son and his relationship with you is a little more important than my anger at you for the moment.” My mother replied. “I don’t need your help to manage my son, Brenda.” Sandy sneered at her. “Don’t talk to her like that.” Davey snapped at her and she turned back to him and opened her mouth to deliver a tirade when Bev ran over her foot. “Ow!” Sandy shouted as she hopped around on her other foot, glaring at Bev who shrugged her shoulders. Davey had a tough time not bursting out in laughter, but he was hiding a big smile behind a hand. “I swear, Sandy, I get enough of this at home from my mother.” Bev said with an exasperated sigh as Sandy hopped around for another moment. She was glaring fiercely at Bev now, but her mouth was staying shut. “I’m sorry, Aunt Bev.” Davey said in a slightly meek tone. “You need to apologize to your mother.” Bev told Davey sharply. “For what?” His voice almost cracked and he looked stunned. “I thought you were on my side!” “I’m on no one’s side.” Bev retorted. “No matter what, she is your mother and deserves more respect than you’ve shown her tonight.” “You’re right.” Davey said after a long moment of thinking. He stood a little straighter and turned to face his mother. “I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you.” “What about what you said?” His mother retorted in a voice that sounded just as angry as before. “I’m not going to apologize for that.” Davey said firmly and she looked like she was about to go off on him again before Bev moved her wheelchair in a warning gesture. “We’re all intelligent people in this room.” Bev said softly and then she looked over at me with a penetrating stare. “Brian, you’ve been awful quiet. What do you have to say?” “I don’t know if anyone wants to hear my opinion right now.” I said with a shrug, trying to stay out of this mess. “I do.” Davey said softly. “I’d like to hear what he has to say.” My mother said just as softly and everyone turned to look at Sandy who stared at me for a long moment before also nodding. “If I was your parent and you spoke to me like that, I’d be pissed as hell.” I said to Davey and he looked hurt for a moment, before nodding slightly. Sandy looked triumphant until I turned to stare at her. “If I was your son, I’d be ashamed to be related to you.” “What?” Sandy gasped in surprise. “Have you given any thought to what Sean’s father hoped to accomplish by coming over here?” I asked her and her eyes widened in surprise. “Have you given a moment to think that there might be more to this story than you’re hearing from the man? If you had, you might have started this by asking some questions instead of assuming you knew everything you needed to know. If you’d done that you might have realized you were being played by that man.” “What do you mean?” Sandy asked with a hint of anger in her voice, but her eyes told me she was at least thinking. “Davey and I know a lot about Sean and what he’s been going through for the last couple of years.” I said softly. “Did you know that his father had him committed to a mental institution? Did you know that at that place they put electrodes on his penis and shocked him every time he showed any reaction to a picture of a man instead of a woman?” “That… that’s barbaric.” Sandy said with a shudder. “That’s what his father had done to him, and that was the nice stuff.” I continued mercilessly and she shook her head in disbelief. “He’s been kept isolated, he’s been forced to do so many disgusting things I don’t even want to think about them. That man hates his son and won’t rest until he’s made every minute of his son’s life miserable. In the last few weeks, Sean has actually had a few happy moments, most of them over here, and his father is trying to take that away from him.” “But… but the boy is a homosexual.” Davey’s mother protested. “Does that mean he deserves to be treated badly by his own parents?” Davey asked her and she looked at him for a second before turning back to me. “They realize that Sean’s old enough now that they don’t have long to control him.” I continued. “If he ran away again, and he’s done that a few times, they’d end up in trouble because Child Services down in Southern California investigated them. That’s one of the real reasons they moved back up here, so they wouldn’t be watched so much by the government for abusing their son.” “You’re kidding.” Sandy commented, but her voice showed she was believing me. “No, I’m not.” I stated. “Mom, Sean hates his parents now as much as they hate him.” Davey said in a much calmer voice. “The day he turns eighteen, he’s leaving their house. He doesn’t care if has to live on the street to get away from them, but the second he’s of legal age he’s walking out their door with nothing but the shirt on his back.” “And he’ll be better off for it despite having nothing.” I added and she looked horrified. “He’s just a boy, though.” Davey’s mother said. “It happens all the time, Sandy.” Brenda said softly. “Young men like him get thrown out of their homes, or leave because the situation is so unbearable, like it is for Sean, that they would prefer to be homeless than to live in that horror. Sean’s lucky, though. He’s got friends who are willing to stick up for him like Davey and Brian.” “But he’s a homosexual.” Sandy protested again, looking at her son. “I can’t have him putting you in danger.” “I’m in no more danger from him than Brian is from me.” Davey said and I had to do my best to not react to the implications of his words. Unfortunately, his mother caught them too, and the look on her face was filled with surprise, horror, and disbelief. Oh shit. Chapter 16 The silence in the room was deafening following Davey’s statement to his mother. The way she kept opening and closing her mouth made me think of a fish. My mother had gone pale, and Bev was staring at him with wide eyes. What surprised me the most was the calm look on Davey’s face. I had to wonder if he was going insane at that moment. “What are you saying?” Sandy asked Davey at long last. Her voice was weak, and I thought she might be on the verge of passing out. “If just being around Sean was a danger to me, then I must be a danger to Brian or anyone else I’m around, like Jenny for instance.” Davey said calmly and now I was growing more confused. What was the point he was trying to make? “Huh?” Bev asked in a voice that sounded every bit as confused as I felt. “What does Jenny have to do with this?” His mother asked sharply. Her temper was starting to flare up now. “Look at what Dad did to her.” Davey said softly. “I’ve been around Dad all my life. I idolized him, and he was molesting her all those years.” “That… that’s different.” Sandy said defensively. “That… what made your father do those things isn’t something you catch from just being around him.” “But Sean being gay is something I can catch?” Davey asked with a slight tilt of his head. “No, it’s not that.” His mother said defensively. “It’s the AIDS thing. You can catch that from him.” “Then I shouldn’t be around you either.” Davey countered and her face flushed with more anger. “Why do you say that?” She snapped. “You’re just as much at risk as Sean is, well more really.” Davey said to her and she looked stunned. “Sean isn’t having sex with guys, which is how he’d catch it. You had two blood transfusions during your surgeries. Look at that Ryan White kid. That’s how he got it, from a blood transfusion.” “I… how dare you?” She fumed, and she was starting to shake badly as she turned so she didn’t have to look at him. “Mom, I’m sorry.” Davey said softly and she turned back to look at him. “I know you don’t like to think about that, but it was a danger they told you about before the surgery. I know it worries you, but it’s there. If Sean being gay isn’t what puts me in danger from being around him, and you say it’s AIDS, you have to admit that your surgery makes you every bit as much a danger.” “It’s different.” She asserted. “How?” He asked her softly. “It just is.” She insisted, but she looked like she even knew the inanity of that argument. “I know that Sean being gay isn’t something you like, Sandy, but isn’t it his life?” My mother said in a gentle voice. “He’s Davey’s friend, Sandy.” Bev said softly. “I’ll admit, it doesn’t make me comfortable thinking about that… part of his life, but isn’t Davey the person who should decide if they stay friends or not? Davey’s almost an adult now, and he’s proven that he’s more than capable of acting like an adult.” “I wonder about that sometimes.” Sandy muttered as she looked at her son. “You don’t have to like him, Mother.” Davey said gently. “But he’s my friend and I’m not going to abandon him just because you don’t like him. If you don’t want him coming over here, fine. We’ll all go someplace else.” “That’s reasonable.” My mother said at once. “There’s no reason you boys can’t come over to the house, or go somewhere else. We don’t have a pool, but there are plenty of other things to do.” “I… I like having all of you come over here.” Sandy said defensively. “Either all my friends are welcome, or we can go someplace else.” Davey said firmly, but still in a gentle tone. “It’s not fair to any of them to be excluded like that.” “You’re really fine with Sean being a… homosexual?” Sandy asked my mother. “I loved my brother very much, Sandy.” My mother said gently. “Most of our family rejected him, but despite that he was still there for me when I needed help the most. No one else from my family lifted a finger to help me, but he did. I gave him a chance, and what I found was that he wasn’t really all that different because he preferred men. He still wanted to love someone, and to be loved. It’s not like what you see on television, at those parades you know. I mean sure, some are like that, but most gay people I’ve known in my life aren’t really like that. It’s just the news shows those people because they’re so…” “Outrageous.” I said when my mother faltered while looking for the right word. She nodded at me. “If he tries anything, you’ll tell me, right?” Davey’s mother asked him gently as her shoulders sagged in defeat. “Yes.” Davey promised and I sighed with relief of my own. For a moment, I had thought he had gone insane, but once again Davey had proved he could think better in tight situations than I could imagine. “Fine, why don’t you and Brian go do something?” She said with an air of defeat while she looked at my mother. “Brenda, I think the three of us should talk.” “Yes, we should.” My mother replied while Davey and I left their office. It struck me as odd that this was twice now, in two different timelines, that Sean’s father had caused an argument over his son to be fought out in this room. Davey sighed with relief as we headed up to his bedroom, not really saying anything until the door was shut and he was pulling me into a very tight hug. “Jesus that was close.” He mumbled against me while I put my arms around him even as his shoulders began to shake with gentle sobs. We stood like that for a while, he and I standing with our arms wrapped around each other while he cried into my shoulder. Finally he stopped crying and pulled back while I lowered my arms to my side. He wiped his eyes and gave me a small smile. “Thanks.” “Anything for you.” I said softly. “Do you mean that, Brian?” He asked me and I nodded my reassurance. “Good. I almost fucked up there big time.” “For a moment I thought you were going to tell your mother about us.” I said quietly and he chuckled softly while shaking his head. “That’s what I was going to do until I saw her face.” Davey stated. “When I saw her face I knew it’d be a mistake so I made up that other shit.” “That’s something I’ve always admired about you.” I told him. “You’re able to think so quickly on your feet like that. I’d have never been able to jump on that track about your father and her blood transfusion without having a lot of time to think about it first.” “Thanks.” Davey said as his smile slipped. “So you’ll understand what needs to happen now.” “What are you talking about?” I asked as a sliver of fear wormed its way to my gut. Where was his mind going now? “You and me, we can’t keep doing this, at least for now.” Davey said with a frown and I felt like I wanted to start shaking as my stomach dropped to my feet. “We can be friends, but nothing more. She can’t have any reason to suspect us.” “If you’re worried about her kicking you out…” I started to say but he shook his head. “That’s not it.” He said sadly. “I know your parents would give me a place with them. It’d kill my mother though, if she knew. I can’t have her looking at me like that, thinking those things about me. We’ll still be friends, though, and maybe after high school, when we’re in college we can pick up where we left off, but I can’t do this.” “You’re going to let your mother rule your life like this?” I asked him as my anger started to kick in and regretted it instantly. “You just said you’d do anything for me.” He shot back angrily. “Were they just words or did you mean them? I’m not kicking you out of my life, I’m just saying we need to keep it at the level of just being friends. What, you can’t stand the thought of not having sex?” “It’s not the sex I’m worried about, Davey.” I said sharply and he shook his head again. “Then what are you worried about?” He asked. “Davey, it’s wrong for you to put your life on hold for your mother and sister.” I argued. “That’s what you think.” He said with a hurt tone. “Look, you’re the one who said you always have to think things through. Well, go think about this. You’ll figure out I’m right. All we’re stopping is the sex, and the hugging and kissing stuff. We’re still going to be friends, right?” “Right.” I said with a heavy sigh. “I don’t like this Davey. What are you going to do next, date a girl?” “I might have to do that.” Davey said with a shrug. “Mom and Nanny are always asking me when I’m going to get a girlfriend. Nanny keeps pushing this Julie girl at me. Her mother is a volunteer at the hospital with Nanny. She goes to our school, so maybe I can date her and throw them off the track.” “She’s going to expect you to kiss her.” I warned him and he blushed. “It won’t mean anything, Brian.” He said with a heavy sigh. “It’s just maintaining my cover.” “I’m going to go.” I said abruptly as a feeling swept over me to get the hell out of there. The thought of Davey kissing anyone, whether he meant it or not, was too much for me to deal with right now. “Brian, please…” Davey’s voice trailed off with a hurt tone and I turned back to look at him. There were fresh tears in his eyes, but then there were new ones in mine too. “Don’t be mad. Just think about it.” “I will.” I said softly. “I’m not mad, though. I’m hurt, and I’m a little confused as to how you think this is best, but I’m not mad. I love you, Davey.” “I know.” He said softly, looking down at his feet as I shut his bedroom door behind me and made my way out of the house. It was a good thing that I didn’t run into anyone on the way out because by the time I got into my car, I was bawling like a little child. Several hours later my crying had turned into sniffling as I lay on my bed, clutching a pillow to my chest. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was going to lose Davey. No matter how similar this Davey was to the one I’d known and loved, even I had to admit they were very different people. My Davey had decades of experience this one didn’t have, and he’d told me the type of person he’d been at this age. How could I have been foolish enough to expect that this Davey would be faithful to me, would be willing to defy his family and risk their approval of him? “Brian, are you in there?” Mom’s voice from the other side of my door forced me to push back a few more sniffles, wipe my puffed-up eyes and focus back on the present. “I’m in here.” I said and was surprised at how much my voice shook. “Is everything alright, dear?” She asked in a worried tone and before I could say anything, she opened the door and took a very long look at me. “I thought something was up from the way you stormed out of there, and now I have a better idea of what’s going on.” “You do?” I asked in surprise. “What has Davey done now?” She asked with a sigh. “I swear, sometimes that kid can get as mixed up as his mother and grandmother. Does this have something to do with that Julie girl he’s supposed to be meeting for dinner tonight?” “Huh?” I mumbled in surprise as my heart dropped back down into my stomach again. Yep, that was Davey alright. Once he made a decision, he moved forward with it at full speed, and damn any of the consequences. “I was wondering why he was calling a girl to go out.” Mom said sadly. “Let me guess, he doesn’t want his mom to figure out about you two so he’s going to date this Julie girl. Do I have that about right?” “Yes.” I mumbled with a shake of my head. “Did you tell him how messed up that was and how much heartache it could cause?” She asked me. “No, not really.” I admitted softly. “I told him I don’t like it…” “Brian, for a guy who supposedly had experienced having grandchildren, you can spend a lot of time thinking like an ordinary teenager.” Mom said in an exasperated tone. “I’m not good at reacting to surprises.” I muttered miserably. He was already going out with Julie? A fresh batch of tears welled up in my eyes. “Oh my poor Brian.” Mom said sympathetically as those tears dribbled down my cheeks. She crossed the rooms and took me into her arms, where I cried hard enough to soak her blouse. I cried like that for a while, and when I slowed down, she started to dab my cheeks with a handkerchief. “Why don’t you go wash up while I start dinner. Don’t worry about Davey. We’ll all start working on talking some sense into him.” “Thank you, Mom.” I said, grateful once again to have my parents around. No matter how old I ever got, they were always a source of comfort and support for me. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep well that night, and the next day was a rough one for me. Trevor and Brandon showed up at my house, but they were surprised when I showed no interest in going over to Davey’s, or in doing anything else really. All I wanted to do was mope around for the day. They left after barely an hour, leaving me alone to work out on the weight machine that I had barely used in the last few months. We’d been using the sets at Davey’s. “What the hell is going on?” Todd’s voice interrupted me as he stormed onto the back patio just after noon. “What do you mean?” I asked him in a quiet voice. “I mean what’s up with you and Davey?” Todd spat back angrily. “He’s got some stupid girl named Julie over there making calf eyes at him and you’re nowhere around. His mom’s treating her like she’s the future daughter-in-law!” “Oh, Davey decided he’d rather pretend to be straight.” I muttered and Todd’s mouth hung open for a long time. For some reason that put a small smile on my face. “What are you smiling about?” Todd finally demanded. “You should be over there telling him he’s being an idiot!” “I was wondering if a fly really would fly into your mouth.” I chuckled and he shook his head. “Don’t change the subject.” He said sharply. “What are you going to do about that idiot? He’s already kissed her in front of everyone!” “He has?” I asked as my heart sank again. That was getting to be all too familiar a feeling. “Yes.” Todd said with disgust. “Then I guess he and I really are over.” I mumbled and Todd crossed his arms. “You’re only over if you let him do this stupid shit.” Todd said with determination and his foot was tapping on the cement. “Now I’ll ask it again, what are you going to do to stop his idiocy? He doesn’t belong with her, he belongs with you. Then again, if you’re available now, I think I might try pursuing you. You make a good boyfriend.” “I’m honored.” I said with a mocking bow of my head. “Sorry, Todd. You’re a good friend, but I’m not interested in you that way.” “Your loss.” Todd shrugged. “Do you want Davey back?” “Don’t be stupid, of course I do.” I growled. “He’s mine.” “Then you got to get him back.” Todd said as he started to pace. “Now, Davey’s as stubborn as his damn mother, so just talking to him won’t do any good. You’re going to have to make him jealous. I know! You can pick a girl and start dating her! Kiss her in front of him and let him see how it feels!” “I’m not going to lead some poor girl on that way.” I said with determination. “Well then, how about another guy?” He asked. “It’d have to be someone we already know, and you’ll have to do it carefully so no one outside our group knows. I see two choices, really. Me or Trevor.” “Why you or Trevor?” I asked with real curiosity. “Well, after they saw that there was a girl around, Brandon and Sean took off together.” Todd said with a sly grin. “I think they’re really hitting it off good.” “Good for them.” I said with genuine feeling. “I’m not sure about this jealousy thing though. It could really backfire.” “It won’t.” Todd said quickly. “You’d be willing to do this for me?” I asked him with a little surprise. “In a heartbeat.” Todd smiled. “Although if it was real, it’d be even better. You’re a good guy, Brian. But, if I can’t be your boyfriend I’ll take being your friend that helps you out whenever you need it.” “We don’t need to take it that far!” I said quickly as my cheeks blushed. “I know.” Todd teased me. “Davey doesn’t need to know that until later, though, right?” “No, no he doesn’t.” I agreed and Todd held out his hand. We shook then and he gave me a simpering glance. “So, should we practice kissing just to make it look real?” He asked with a hopeful tone. “Not just yet.” I said sternly. Now I had butterflies in my stomach. Part of me said this was stupid, that it could backfire so easily, but I also knew Davey and I didn’t want him sticking his dick in some girl just to secure his cover with his mother. It was three more days before I saw Davey again. After the second day where it was becoming evident Julie was a semi-permanent fixture, along with three of her girlfriends, everyone started meeting over at my house. >From there we’d go and do whatever we felt like that day, without Davey. The phone rang one morning, just after Mom had left for Sandy’s house and Dad had headed off to his work. I picked it up, and pretty much regretted it instantly when I heard Davey’s voice on the other line. Part of me wanted to hang up at his cheerful tone, but I didn’t. “What do you want?” I asked a little more harshly than I should have. “I… I want to see you.” Davey replied in a slightly weak voice. “I miss having you and the guys around. Did you tell them not to come over anymore?” “No.” I answered immediately. “Davey, they can’t be themselves with your… girlfriend and her friends around so they go where they’re more comfortable.” “So you didn’t tell them to stay away from me?” He asked plaintively. “No.” I replied. “I wouldn’t do something like that.” “Can we do something today?” He asked me in what was almost a whine. “I miss you already.” “What do you want to do?” I asked as the desire to see him overcame my anger for a moment. “We could go to the mall.” He said in a slightly happier tone. “Julie’s birthday is next weekend and I was thinking of getting her a necklace.” “Let me get this straight.” I said sharply as anger welled up inside of me. “You want to take the guy you dumped because your mother might guess we were a couple, and have him go with you to buy a necklace for some bimbo you’re seeing?” “Julie’s not a bimbo.” Davey said defensively. “No, I guess she’s not, but then neither am I.” I practically yelled into the phone before slamming it down. For several minutes I fumed, cussing out Davey and his idiotic thinking before deciding I really did need to do something. Trevor was doing something with his father today. Brandon was with his siblings and had Sean over, so that left Todd, whose crazy idea wasn’t sounding so bad just about now. “Hello?” Todd said as I called his number. “Hey, it’s Brian.” I said in a neutral tone. “Yo, dude, what’s up?” He asked in a happier tone. “I was wondering if you wanted to do something today.” I sort of asked him. “Uh, yeah, I was just sitting around.” He replied. “I’ve got the day off.” “Cool, how about I pick you up?” I asked. “About an hour?” “Fine by me.” He said happily and I hung up the phone. Almost exactly an hour later I was showered, shaved, and wearing a pair of khaki pants with one of my tightest blue t-shirts. “Where to?” He asked me as he got into the mustang. “How about the mall?” I asked with a perverse idea. Davey would probably be there, and even though I knew better, I wanted him to see me there with Todd. “Fine by me.” Todd said. “So, you hear from Davey lately?” “Yeah.” I said as my good mood evaporated. “Oh, how’d that go?” He asked. “He accused me of telling you guys to stay away from him.” I started off and Todd shook his head. “I told him you guys probably just weren’t comfortable with his girl and her friends there.” “That’s for sure.” Todd grumbled. “So, do you think Sean and Brandon are going to hook up?” “It’d be nice.” I answered. “You think they’ve actually done anything yet?” “They’ve fooled around.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Sean spent the next day praying on his knees for forgiveness, but as soon as Brandon called him he went right over. That boy is still mixed up in the head.” “Yeah, well, he has us to support him.” I stated. “Yup.” Todd agreed as he smiled at me again. “You think anymore about my idea?” “Yeah, I thought about it.” I said with a sigh. “And?” Todd asked with a tilt of his head. “Davey asked me to go to the mall with him to help him pick out a necklace for Julie.” I said sourly. “That stupid son of a bitch!” Todd exclaimed and then he started laughing. “We’re going to the mall, right?” “Yup.” I answered with a knowing grin. “You can be an evil man, Brian.” Todd smirked as he reached across the seat to rub my leg. “Todd, don’t take it too far.” I warned him with a little growl. “I know, I know.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Just remember, if Davey never fucking wakes up and smells the coffee, you’ve got lots of options.” “I know, and I appreciate that, Todd.” I said with a sideways glance at him. “I like you. You’re a good guy, but I don’t feel that way about you. Maybe we shouldn’t do this. You’ll only end up getting hurt.” “No, I won’t.” Todd said with a slightly pained expression. “Yeah, it’ll suck if it works and you two get back together, but for a little while at least I can pretend, and maybe I’ll have an idea about what it’ll be like when I do meet someone as nice as you.” “Fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” I said a little fiercely and he smiled as we pulled into the parking lot of the mall. Vintage Fair mall hadn’t been remodeled since it was built in the 1970’s, and still reflected some of the psychedelic décor of that time period. It’d be another fifteen years before it was remodeled and would get stores like Abercrombie & Fitch, or Hollister. Many of the same jewelry stores were there, and I couldn’t help but stop and point out a nice gold chain meant for a man to Todd. “I like that one.” He said to me just as Davey walked up to us. I’d noticed him on the other side of the mall and he’d been watching us as we went up to the jewelry store. “Is this why you wouldn’t come with me?” Davey snarled without any preamble and I turned to see him with a face reddened by his anger. “You decided to get yourself a new boy-toy and you’re going to buy him something now?” “What does it matter to you if he is?” Todd snarled back. “You’re the one who broke things off with him so you could pretend with that Julie girl.” “Don’t get in the middle of this.” Davey snarled at him while I looked around to see if anyone was close enough to hear us. “Davey, you might want to be careful or someone will hear us.” I said calmly. “You know what, fuck you Brian Breckenridge.” Davey snarled. “Not anymore.” I growled back at him and he stepped back while his eyes widened and Todd chuckled. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, Davey, you know exactly what I mean.” I told him. “It didn’t take you long to go from just using her as a cover to kissing her all over the place. Sean told me how she had her hand down your bathing suit the other day.” “I didn’t want her to do that!” Davey snarled defensively. “I told her to take it out as soon as it happened!” “No you didn’t.” Todd sneered. “You waited at least a minute until you noticed other people were seeing it happen.” “We used to do that stuff all the time and no one ever thought it was a big deal.” Davey said defensively. “You’re right, you can do it all you want.” I snarled at him, finally letting the anger I was feeling really vent out. “Just don’t expect me to sit around and wait for you to get bored.” “I thought you said you’d always love me.” He almost whined. “I will always love you, Davey.” I answered honestly, meeting his hurt gaze with a hurt gaze of my own. “What you have to understand is that I don’t have to live my life with you even though I love you. Sure, I wanted to live my life with you, but, you know, I don’t know if you’re worth it.” “What?” Davey nearly shrieked. “You come back in time for me and don’t think I’m worth it anymore?” “Huh?” Todd said in confusion and I stared at Davey as realization dawned on his face. “It’s a private joke.” Davey temporized quickly and Todd shook his head in confusion. “Brian told me one time he’d even come back in time for me if he had to.” “You guys can have some weird conversations, or at least you used to have them.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Shut up, dirtbag.” Davey told him sharply. “You couldn’t even wait a week before trying to sink your claws in Brian.” “Why not, you took less time than that to dump him for some cunt.” Todd sneered and Davey lashed out with a fist, catching Todd in the stomach and doubling him over. “That’s not what I did.” Davey said fiercely, but his eyes were pleading with me. “I have to do this. You understand, don’t you, Brian?” “I understand why you want to, but I don’t understand why you are stupid enough to think it’s the right thing to do.” I countered him while reaching out to support Todd who was clutching his gut. “I also don’t understand why you think it’s okay to hit Todd. I thought you were better than that.” “Maybe I’m just a stupid kid without decades and decades of growing up.” Davey sneered and I gave him a narrowed-eye look before shaking my head. “C’mon Todd, let’s get you out of here.” I said sadly as I walked away, supporting Todd and not even looking back at Davey Jones. Chapter 17 I was lying on the ground with a sharp pain in my midsection. My ears were ringing from the force my head had hit the grass with, despite the helmet, and it was hard to even breath at the moment. It was the last practice before our Championship game, and we were only wearing shoulder pads and helmets instead of full gear, and we most definitely were not supposed to be hitting each other this hard. “Jones, what the fuck is wrong with you?” Coach Cole snarled as he reached me and knelt down. Davey stood over me, probably glaring daggers at me like he’d done every time we’d seen each other for the last few months. Part of me had hoped he’d not play after all, and another part wanted to quit the team, but he was there and I wouldn’t quit just because of him. “Sorry coach.” Davey said around his mouth guard before turning and walking away. “You okay, Breckenridge?” Coach asked as he helped me sit up. “Just got the breath knocked out of me.” I said weakly. “What is it between you two?” Cole asked me with real concern. “Last semester you two couldn’t be pried apart with a crowbar.” “Yeah, well, things change.” I said as I got to my feet. Coach had to support me as I limped to the sidelines and Brandon went in to take my place. Two hours later I was pulling into the driveway of Davey’s house. I hadn’t been there since that day he’d ended our relationship to keep his mother from figuring out he was gay. If I had any choice, I wouldn’t be here now. “Yes?” The Housekeeper, a middle-aged Mexican woman asked when I rang the doorbell. “I’m Brian, Brenda’s son.” I said holding the box Mom had asked me to pick up at the airport. “Oh yes, come in.” The woman said with a slight smile. “She’s in the office. I’ll show you the way.” “I know it.” I said grimly. It felt weird being in here, like I was an interloper. At least Davey wasn’t here. Neither was my mother, I discovered as I entered the room that had once been President Jones’s study. Davey’s mother was in there alone, doing some paperwork. “Brian!” She exclaimed with a smile as I entered. “Good, you got it. Why don’t you put it over there on the table?” “Sure, Mrs. Jones.” I said softly as she pointed to a side table. I put the box down, wiping my hands on my jeans and turned, preparing to leave. “How have you been, Brian?” She asked me before I could escape. “I’ve been well, ma’am.” I said simply, hoping she’d let it go at that. “I haven’t seen you in ages.” She said and I realized I was in for the full questioning. “I’ve been busy.” I said softly. “That’s what Davey’s said.” She stated with a frown. “He’s been miserable, you know. He won’t tell me what caused you boys to fight.” “It’s a guy thing.” I said quickly and she frowned. “I haven’t seen that Sean boy around here much, either.” She said. “Did that have something to do with it? I thought it was agreed it would be okay if he came over as long as he didn’t… do anything.” “He isn’t comfortable over here.” I said, hoping this was a way to get her to let me go. “I think he knows he’s not really wanted over here and he’s nice enough to not push himself where he’s not wanted.” “I see.” She said with a deeper frown. “You know that had nothing to do with you, right? I’d hate to think that Davey’s best friend abandoned him because of something his mother said.” “I…uh…” I stammered, not able to find anything to say that wasn’t a lie or too close to the truth. “You know that Davey does miss you, don’t you?” She asked. “I mean, he’s been doing poorly in school without someone to study with, and all those girls he’s been dating haven’t done much to help him concentrate on his books. I’m starting to worry he might not be able to get into a good school if he keeps this up.” “With all due respect, that’s his problem.” I said a little more forcefully than I should have. Davey had dumped Julie two weeks into the school year, and was now dating Heather, one of the cheerleaders running for Homecoming Queen. Davey was rumored to be the favorite for King this year. “Why are you so angry with him, then?” She asked directly. “After everything he went through where you supported him, I can’t understand why you would turn your back on him when he’s finally getting his life put together.” “Maybe because I disagree with how he’s going about doing that.” I said with a shrug. It was time this conversation ended. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some more errands to run. It was nice seeing you again.” “Don’t be such a stranger, Brian.” She murmured as I left the room. Unfortunately I didn’t make it out of the house in time, because Davey was walking in with Riley from the football team, and both Heather and Riley’s girlfriend, Marsha were following behind. “Oh, hi.” Davey said as he saw me in the entranceway. “I was just leaving.” I said shortly and moved to push my way through them, garnering a glare from Riley and a look of confusion between the two girls. “What is it with him?” I heard Heather ask from behind. “Brian, wait!” Davey called out before I’d gone three steps to my car. He said something under his breath to the others and shut the door behind him as he caught up with me. “I’m sorry about the hit today. It was wrong of me.” “Apology accepted.” I said simply, not looking at him. “Is that all you have to say?” He asked in a hurt tone. “What else is there to say?” I asked him. “You made it quite clear already. You don’t want to risk your mom knowing about what used to be between us, I don’t want to live a lie, watching you make out with some girl all the time.” “It doesn’t have to be this way.” Davey said in a hurt voice. “I miss you.” “You’re right, it doesn’t have to be this way.” I said turning around to look at him. He looked shocked by the anger in my eyes. “You chose your path, I chose mine.” “Are you and Todd really going out or is it just to make me jealous?” He asked. “We’re planning on going to Arizona State together.” I said with a shrug. “Why?” He asked with a frown. “You remember my plan for the future?” I asked him and he nodded. “Well after the incident at the mall, I decided I could trust him and I told him everything. He’s going to help me, and that’s why we’re going to Arizona State. It’s part of the plan.” “I was going to help you…” Davey’s voice drifted off and his hurt look deepened. “You know, this is just until after high school, or maybe after college, once I don’t need Mom’s support anymore. We can get back together then.” “Have you fucked any of those girls yet?” I asked him pointedly and he blanched. “Have you fucked Todd yet?” He demanded of me. “No, we’re good friends, not lovers.” I replied. “Todd wants more, and who knows, maybe after you’re out of my life once and for all, I might like him that way, but for now, no.” “I haven’t had sex with any of the girls.” Davey said softly and there were tears in his eyes. “That’s why I keep breaking up with them. They want to go further than I’m willing.” “Just how far are you willing to go with them?” I snapped, not really wanting to know the answer. “Julie’s the only one to get so far as her hands down my pants.” Davey said defiantly, as if daring me to disbelieve him. “Why not?” I asked him. “Do you really have to ask that?” His voice quaked slightly. “Yes.” I answered. “Because I’m still in love with you and I don’t want anyone but you!” He nearly shouted, and then looked horrified at how loud he’d reacted. With fear, he looked around and only relaxed slightly when he realized no one was around. When he turned back to me, he looked slightly ashamed, but also determined to say something. “Why? Brian, why did you react like this?” “If you love someone you don’t dictate to them.” I said softly. “When you decided this was what you wanted, you were dictating to me the terms of our relationship. I’m not stupid enough to let you turn our relationship into a one-way street.” “I didn’t… that’s not what I wanted to do!” He protested. “It’s what you did.” I replied. “If you wanted to make it a one-way street, well two can play that game, Davey. I love you, I love you a lot, but that love does not give you the right to treat me like a doormat.” “You still love me?” He asked with a look of hope. “I will love you until the day I die, and probably even beyond that if there’s a way.” I said to him with all my heart. “But you’re still not going to take me back?” He asked. “Not like this, no.” I said. “I’m sorry Davey, I’d be willing to come up with something to work around your fears with your parents, but I won’t be dictated to, and that’s what you wanted.” “So, if I said it differently we could still work things out?” He asked hopefully. “Not at this point.” I said with a sad shake of my head. “Maybe back when this all began. No, don’t say anything. I made a couple of mistakes too, like that trip to the mall. It takes two to tango, and we were both ready to dance. But, now we’ve made our beds, separately, and we’ll have to live with them.” “I don’t want a life without you.” He said miserably. “But you put your mother and family as being more important.” I said simply. “I understand that, Davey, I really do. They mean more to you than anything else, including your own life. That’s fine, really, if you want to live your life as a slave to their expectations, their goals, and their desires, that’s your prerogative. Just don’t expect me to go along for the ride.” “I…” He started to say before he fell silent. “Goodbye, Davey.” I said before turning and heading back to my car. It had a feeling of finality to it, and my eyes were clouded with tears by the time I pulled out of the driveway and headed home. When I saw Todd’s car already there waiting for me, it was actually a relief, and he followed me inside the empty house without bothering to say a word. He’d seen the look on my face, and knew I’d spend the next thirty minutes with his arms wrapped around me while I soaked his shirt with more tears. It had happened often enough, and we didn’t even bother going further in the house than the entryway before I bent over and cried into his shoulder. He was a lot shorter than me, which meant that by the time I was done, my neck and back was sore, but I was grateful. When his lips locked on mine as I tried to straighten up, I was caught totally by surprise. Sure, I knew he still carried a torch for me, but he’d never tried this before. Still, there was something in that touch, that kiss that lit a fire inside me. I had been without this since Davey and I had… broken up, and it felt good as we kissed. Not nearly as good as Davey, but still… “No.” I said as I finally broke away from the kiss. “No, what?” Davey’s harsh voice surprised me and I turned to see him standing inside the doorway, a look of anger and pain on his face. “Oh shit.” Todd said softly, moving out of my embrace even as I stepped back as well. “So, I thought you said the two of you weren’t more than friends.” Davey snarled at me as anger totally replaced the look of hurt. “It’s nice to know I can be as stupid as my mother when it comes to believing the men I love.” “Davey, it’s not like that.” Todd said before I could even think of a single thing to say. “I kissed him. It was the first time!” “How was it?” Davey snarled his question at me as he clenched and unclenched his fists. “Not the same.” I said with a sad look at him. “I’m sorry Todd, but I don’t love you.” “It was worth a try.” Todd said with a shrug. “But then, I didn’t expect to get caught by him.” “Of course you didn’t.” Davey sneered. “Why should I come over here anymore? Tell me Todd, how much of this has been your idea?” “Davey, stop that.” I said sharply. “We’ve got enough problems between us that you don’t need to make new ones.” “Yeah, well I was coming over to see if that offer of always having a place to stay here still stood, but I don’t know now.” Davey snarled again. “I don’t know if I can stand to see all of our friends trying to get down your pants.” “Like you expected me to stand around and watch all those girls do the same to you?” I snapped back at him before the import of his words hit me. “What do you mean if you could stay here?” “Mom’s kicked me out.” Davey snapped with a look of hurt. “Why would she do that?” Todd asked with a perplexed look. “Because I’m a fucking pervert as bad as my father.” Davey snarled angrily, but there were tears in his eyes. “What happened?” I asked with real concern as my anger washed away in the blink of an eye. I took a step towards him, and he responded by stepping towards me before he fell into my arms, crying on my shoulders. It was a long time before he could make any sounds that were intelligible. Todd helped me guide Davey towards a couch, and got a box of tissues for Davey to blow his nose once he calmed down. “She confronted me after you left.” Davey said softly as he clutched my hand. We were now sitting side-by-side with Todd in a chair across from us. “About what?” “About you, about me, about what I did to keep you away.” Davey said sadly. His shoulders shook a bit more, and his voice was quivering. “She kept harping on me in front of Riley and Heather and Jennifer. I snapped. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told her, right there in front of everyone.”",

      "content": "“You what?” Todd gasped in shock while I blinked. Yes, trust Davey to let his anger get the best of him and tell everything, or nearly everything. “I told her.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “I told her that Brian and me had been a couple, as in lovers, that we loved each other. Then I told her that after I heard her talk about Sean that way that I knew she’d never accept us, so I broke things off and started dating girls to make her happy, but that I’d never sleep with any of them because I loved Brian.” “Holy shit.” Todd said with a hint of respect in his voice. “What happened then?” “Heather slapped me.” Davey chuckled but he was on the verge of tears still and he squeezed my hand tightly. “Riley just shook his head and the three of them left before my mom started to tear into me. You know, she has no problem believing I’m a ‘fucking pervert’, but she says I seduced Brian, turned him into a pervert and she’s going to warn Brenda to keep me away from him. Then she kicked me out. Told me to pack my car with stuff and get the fuck out of there. Last I heard, she was on the phone to Nanny and Papa after she called Dad and blamed him for perverting their son.” “Jesus fucking Christ.” Todd muttered while I pulled Davey into me closer. “I’m so sorry, Davey.” I said softly. “It’s not your fault.” Davey said with a sigh. “I don’t know why I thought pretending would fix anything. All it did was make her madder when she found out. I think that’s what she’s so angry about, not that I’m gay so much as the fact that I lied about it to her all this time. Imagine if it had been years and years of my lying to her before she found out.” “Oh believe me, it would have been bad.” I chuckled softly. “The other me tell you about that?” Davey asked and then he looked at Todd for a moment. “You said you told him, right?” “That he’s some weird kind of time-traveler and really a perverted old man in a young body?” Todd asked rhetorically. “Yeah, he told me. I told him he was wasting his second youth. He should be out there screwing everything in sight that he knew would bend over instead of pining after… oh, um, sorry.” “I… I thought the same thing at first.” Davey said with a blush. “Sometimes I wonder if he’d have been better off without me in his life.” “No, never that.” I said with a shudder as I remembered Davey telling me about that life in another timeline. “So, my other self, he told you about her finding out one time?” Davey asked with a little half-smile. “I can tell you later.” I said. “Is it funny?” He asked. “Yes.” I answered. “C’mon Davey, you know your life. Do you think the story would be anything but funny?” “I need to hear it, please?” Davey asked in a needy voice and I had to sigh before giving in to him. I should still be angry at him, part of me said, but I loved him. “It was in the original timeline.” I began to tell him a story of an alternate version of his life. “You’d joined the Navy after dropping out of Downey. Three years later you were in the Gulf War.” “Gulf war?” Todd asked. “Yeah, in 1990 Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq invades Kuwait and we not only stop him there, but kick his ass back to Baghdad.” I answered. “So anyway, on the way back, this ship you were assigned to stopped in Hawaii. You flew your boyfriend, Keith, out to see you there, planning to spend a whole week on that tropical island with him.” “Sounds fun.” Todd murmured a little jealously. “How’d I afford that?” Davey asked. “You saved up a lot of money for him.” I answered with a shrug. “Anyway, two weeks before you pull into Hawaii, you call your mother from Hong Kong. Somehow her and Jenny scraped up enough money to go to Hawaii at the same time you were going to be there.” “They didn’t know at the time, did they?” Davey asked and I grinned. “That sucks.” Todd groaned. “Vacation ruined.” “Yup.” I chuckled. “You spent the week trying to find time to have sex with your boyfriend you haven’t seen in six months. Your sister kept trying to trip him into her bed, and your mom wanted to spend every minute she could with you. Needless to say it was a very frustrating week for everyone. After it was over, you went back to San Diego where you were stationed, and you lived with him.” “That must have been nice.” Davey said wistfully as he relaxed against me. It felt so natural for us to be like this. “I’m sure it was.” I murmured. “Anyway, you were planning this big birthday party for your sister. Your family was all going to come down, and you hired caterers and everything. You told me you got a second job as a bouncer at a bar in order to get enough money to do all this. Then, the night before your sister and mother were to fly down, your mother called. There was another roommate you shared the apartment with besides your boyfriend, and his boyfriend answered the phone. When he told your mom you were at work, she asked for and got the number.” “This doesn’t sound good.” Todd added. “Nope.” Davey agreed, but he was smiling. “Anyway, your mom called the bar, and got the answering machine.” I continued the story. “It said: Hi, you’ve reached Rich’s, the biggest Gay Bar in San Diego…” “Hah!” Todd started laughing while Davey shook his head. “What did she do?” Davey asked. “She left a message.” I chuckled. “She said ‘Tell David Jones Jr. to call his mother this instant!’ It was an hour before he got the message and he rushed to a payphone to call her. The first words out of her mouth were “Are you fucking Keith?” “No, he’s fucking me.” Davey muttered the punch line of his own story from a time he never knew, shocking me. “Well, that’s what I would say.” “That’s what you did say.” I laughed softly and Todd shook his head. “It was months before the two of you ever talked again, but she called Keith each and every night for two weeks.” “I wonder what ever happened to him?” Davey asked. “If I loved him, why wasn’t he around later when…” “I asked about that.” I admitted. “He… he was partying with some guys and flew off to San Francisco with one of them who was really rich, and that was the last that Davey ever saw of him. Two months later, you moved back home with your mother to go back to college. Keith had taken all the money you’d saved up, and you didn’t have enough for rent, and by that time you were out of the Navy.” “That sucks.” Todd shook his head. “I hope I end up with someone like Brian. He’d never do something like that.” “But I would, I did.” Davey said glumly. “Davey, there’s always a room here for you.” I said softly. “I don’t care if we’re talking or not, boyfriends or not, there is always a place here for you. My parents would kill me if I didn’t support that.” “They’re probably as pissed at me as you are.” Davey said miserably. “I certainly hope so.” I said with a laugh and he looked at me like I was insane. “Doofus.” Todd said to him. “You don’t get it, do you? Brian’s saying he’s forgiven you.” “You are?” Davey asked me and I nodded after a moment. “Why?” “Because I love you, and, well, you came right to me after your mother kicked you out.” I said with a shrug. “You got kicked out because you told the truth about you and me, and the only reason to tell the truth would be because you want us to be back together.” “You figured all that out, eh?” Davey asked with a shake of his head. “Yeah, I did.” I acknowledged. “So where do we go now?” Davey asked. “Shit, Heather! It’s going to be all over the school now.” “You never do anything halfway.” Todd said with a grin. “It’s all or nothing with you.” “Shut up.” Davey growled. “My god, we can’t go to school tomorrow! It’s Homecoming!” “We will go, and I’ll be right there with you.” I assured him. “Me too.” Todd added. “Oh, don’t glare at me like that, Davey. I like Brian a lot, maybe too much, but I know a lost cause when I see one. Without you in the picture I might have a chance, but if there’s even a hope of him being with you, he’ll never look at me as more than a friend.” “Damn right about that.” I growled. “Okay, fine, but I’ll be watching you, Todd.” Davey glared at his friend. “Davey, Brian, are you in here?” Mom’s voice announced her arrival, and her worried tone said she’d spoken with Sandy already. “We’re in here!” I half-yelled and she entered the room, stopping as soon as she saw Davey in my arms. “Well, that’s at least one problem solved.” She said and then she looked at Todd with an inquiring look. “I’m pissed that Brian’s not on the market anymore.” Todd said to her with a shrug, which was a little brave of him. He smiled when my mother shook her head at him. “Brian, dear, do you have any boy friends who are actually straight?” Mom asked me with mock exasperation. “Not that I can name off the top of my head, no.” I laughed. “How are you holding up, dear?” Mom asked Davey as she reached the couch and put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m better now than I have been in a long time.” Davey answered with a relieved sound. “I hate to have to ask this but…” “We’ll get your room ready for you later tonight.” Mom said. “Sandy’s still in the yelling mood and won’t listen. I’m going to pick up Bev in the morning and we’re going to tag-team her. You won’t have to stay here for more than a day or two.” “I’m sorry, Mrs. B.” Davey said softly. “It’s Brian you need to apologize to, and those poor girls.” Mom answered him. “The girls?” Davey asked with confusion. “Yes, dear, those girls.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “You’re a smart enough young man to figure out why.” “I used them.” Davey said after a moment. “I led them on, made them believe that more was possible than there really was.” “Yes, dear, you did.” Mom’s tone made her feelings about that crystal clear. “This is not going to be fun.” Davey said with a heavy sigh, causing Mom to chuckle a bit. “Well at least things are back on the right track.” She said with a light tone before looking over at Todd. “You going to stay for dinner?” “I better be getting home.” He said a little reluctantly. “I’ll see you two at school. This is going to be fun.” “God I hope not.” Davey said miserably, but there was a little smile on his face as Todd left the house. “Brian, your father should be home in time for dinner so we’ll fill him in on the day’s events then.” Mom said. “Why don’t you help Davey unload his car? It looks like it’s filled.” “Okay mom.” I said. Davey and I got up then and started to unload his car. He’d packed it mostly with clothes, and a few other odds and ends, which made quite a pile on the bed in the guest room. We were taking in the last load when Dad’s car pulled up in the driveway. Davey and I paused as he got out of his car and looked at the two of us. “Well, this is a surprise.” He said after a moment. “A pleasant one at that. I take it Davey’s finally come to his senses?” “You might say that, and my Mom doesn’t want me around at the moment.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Well, why don’t we all head inside and you can fill me in on the details?” Dad said in a kindly tone that seemed to relax Davey a bit. We finished telling the story over dinner, and Dad was just reiterating his support for Davey when there was a banging on the front door. “That would probably be Pete.” Dad said with a wry chuckle as he got up. Sure enough, it was Davey’s grandfather who stormed in the house, glaring at Davey who was looking a little sheepish. “What kind of tomfoolery are you getting yourself into now, boy?” Pete demanded angrily. “Your mother tells me you’ve gone and decided to be a pervert. You know your soul will burn in hell?” “That’s enough of that, Pete.” Mom said sternly. “Don’t give me no lip, Brenda.” Pete half-snarled. “You don’t know the bible. It says…” “Judge not lest ye be judged.” Mom interrupted him, and for the next twenty minutes I learned something about my mother that I had never known before. She held her own against Pete, quoting a bible verse to counter every one he threw at her. Halfway through Pete relaxed from the angry stance he’d had to something more like his normal self. Finally, he just grunted at her. “Well, we’ll know which of us is right on Judgment Day.” He said flatly before turning back to Davey. “You know I don’t approve of this no matter what she says.” “I know.” Davey said in a firm voice. “I don’t tell you how to live your life, though, Papa.” “Damn right you don’t.” Pete groused and then he nodded. “Fine, you’re going to do what you want to do. Just don’t make me ashamed to be related to you.” “I won’t.” Davey said sternly and Pete nodded before turning to leave without saying another word. “I have no idea what that means.” Davey admitted as the door closed behind his grandfather. “It’s a start.” Mom said softly. “Don’t worry Davey. Your family will come around given time. If he didn’t care, he’d not have come here, and he’d not have stayed as long as he did, or left like that.” “I hope you’re right, Mom B.” Davey said with a heavy sigh as he leaned against me. “She is.” I assured him. Chapter 18 I remembered the last timeline quite clearly, and the reactions of Davey’s family to his sexuality. An older, wiser Davey had years and years to prepare them in subtle ways. Sometimes I think he did it almost without even thinking or planning it, just presented his family with ‘learning experiences’ that nudged them in the right direction. Unfortunately, he had none of that in this timeline. He didn’t have the experience of his first disastrous coming out, nor the memories of years of arguments and discussions that had finally led to grudging acceptance. Nor did he have the years of preparation based on those memories. Instead, he just had me, my parents, and his Aunt Bev. As it turns out, Aunt Bev was all he needed anyway. The woman was a force of nature with an indomitable will. According to her family, she’d always been strong-willed, but recovering from the accident that had left her paralyzed from the neck down had transformed her from merely strong-willed to something else, something more. She might not be able to get out of her wheelchair without someone lifting her, but she was more than capable of lifting anyone by the figurative neck and slapping them around verbally until they saw things her way. The first person she set her sights on that night of Davey’s ‘coming out’, was Davey. She grilled him for nearly an hour over the phone, and at times he was angry, blushing from embarrassment, or silent as she let him know what she thought. The second person to benefit from her opinion was me. That conversation was far shorter, and after a few questions that started with “When did you know you were homosexual?”, most of the conversation was her warning me to not hurt her Davey. “I really don’t want to go to school today.” Davey said early the next morning when I went to his room to wake him up for an early morning run. “I think I’m going to be sick.” “Your stomach is all tied up in knots.” I stated flatly and he nodded with a miserable look on his face. “I feel like I’m going to puke.” He really did sound miserable. “You always feel this way when things are like this.” I said with a shrug. “You told me that it just got worse as time went by and you had to learn to ignore it, to just move forward despite the yuckiness. You told me that if you hadn’t learned to do that, you’d have never succeeded in making anything better in your life.” “I hate that me.” He said with a shake of his head before climbing out of bed and stumbling around to get a pair of sweats on. “I bet that me liked getting up early too.” “No, he hated it with a passion.” I laughed. “Good, at least he didn’t go totally crazy.” Davey sighed. “Let’s get the show on the road.” After stretching out, we jogged at an easy pace for two miles. He actually managed a smile on his face when Mom served us breakfast, and we headed out the door a little early for school. Today we both went in my car, and we pulled into the parking lot nearly a half-hour early. “Oh shit.” Davey mumbled as we got out of the car and saw Heather and Riley standing nearby. Heather had a very determined look on her face while Riley looked uncomfortable. His girlfriend was nowhere to be seen, which I couldn’t decide if that was good or bad. As they walked towards us, I watched Davey take in a deep breath before letting it out slowly. “Well?” Heather said in a stern voice as she crossed her arms and stopped just a foot away from Davey. “I’m sorry.” Davey blurted out and managed to look surprised at his own words. Heather cocked her head to the side and raised an eyebrow but otherwise remained silent, obviously waiting for more. “I’m sorry for misleading you, Heather. You’re a good person. Bright, funny, and very beautiful and you deserve to be treated better than I treated you.” “Oh, I don’t know.” Heather said sarcastically. “You treated me pretty good except for the whole making me think you were interested in me thing.” “I do like you, as a friend.” Davey said defensively. “I almost… I almost wish things were different so I could really be interested in you that way, but I’m not and it was wrong of me to lead you on.” “So you really are queer?” Riley said in a neutral tone and then he looked at me with a very direct look. “You and him both.” “Yes.” Davey said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. “Why?” Heather asked. “Why what?” Davey responded. “Why did you go out with me, and the others as well if you knew you were queer and obviously have nothing against it.” Heather asked. “It was my mother.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and he put everything on the table, although he didn’t mention Sean’s name. While he left that out, he told just about everything else in about fifteen minutes. People walked by us while he talked, but something about how we were standing kept them from approaching, even Brandon and Trevor who arrived just before Davey finished. “I accept your apology.” Heather said when he was done while Riley stood there shaking his head. “I don’t quite understand why you’re queer and don’t have a problem with it, but at least you’re man enough to stand up for yourself. I won’t say anything to anybody, on one condition.” “What’s that?” Davey asked. “Homecoming is tonight.” Heather said with a steely gaze. “We made plans.” “I know.” Davey said softly. “Good.” She said firmly. “You’re going to carry through with them. After tonight, you and I will break up, but for the rest of today we’re still a couple. Anyone have any problems with that?” “No.” Davey and I said in unison while Riley shook his head. “What about you, Riley?” Heather asked. “You got any problems keeping quiet about this stuff if Davey follows through with tonight?” “I don’t understand this whole queer thing, but I’ll keep my mouth shut as long as you don’t try anything with me.” Riley said quietly. “Good, now Davey, put your arm around me and walk me to class.” Heather commanded with a questioningly look at me. I just smiled and waited for them to move off. When they were gone, Riley stayed put, giving me a searching gaze. “You know, I’d have never thought you were a queer.” He said with a disbelieving shake of his head. “Then again, after that shit you went through with Marcie, I might have given up on girls altogether too.” “Yeah, well, it’s a little more complicated than that.” I said with a shrug. “You going to be okay?” “Yeah, I’ll be fine.” He said before walking off. As soon as he was gone, I was swarmed by Trevor and Brandon, who had hooked up with Sean and Todd. Everyone wanted to know what was going on, and when they heard that it sounded like we weren’t going to be outed to the entire school, they all looked a little relieved. As expected, Heather won Homecoming Queen, and Davey was King. She seemed to be very happy with the day’s events, and the fact that we won the game that night made it even better. What was best of all was the fact that she kept her promise, as did Riley (and his girlfriend). There was no public outing for us at Downey that year, although there were whispers and by the time baseball season rolled around, we were pretty sure everyone guessed that Davey and I were a couple. No one brought it out in the open though, and as long as we didn’t do anything too public, it seemed like people were fine with leaving it as just a rumor. I heard a few rumors about Sean and Brandon towards the end of the year, and even I was surprised about Todd and Trevor. The two of them somehow became thick as thieves, and by the time of Davey’s eighteenth birthday it was readily apparent they were a couple. Davey’s family more than made up for the lack of drama at school. Frantic middle-of-the-night calls from an angry Sandy woke all of us up several times until Mom took the phone off the hook. In November, Davey’s father stepped into the mix, at Sandy’s request, and the fireworks really exploded between father and son. We all did what we could to support Davey, but he would fluctuate between being overly happy and depressed. It was after Thanksgiving that things really came to a head. Both of Davey’s parents insisted that he get ‘counseling’ at a local church. Davey kept refusing, and his parents pulled the law into the fight. They reported him as a runaway, and we got a visit from the local police department one night. Legally there was nothing we could do immediately, and Davey left with the two officers who took him back to his mother’s house where his parents were waiting with the pastor of the church offering counseling for ‘troubled youth’. The next morning, both Mom and Beverly ‘quit’ working for Sandy. Dad, at my urging, called the local Social Services department and a figure familiar to me made a visit to Davey’s home, just in time to see the action. After Davey had rudely rebuffed the efforts of the pastor the night before, the man had convinced Sandy to order Davey committed for ‘treatment’ as a ‘rebellious, out of control teenager’. They made up all sorts of things about drug and alcohol abuse, that might have been true two years ago, but were not true now. Mary Lou Hacker walked in just as three burly men were attempting to subdue Davey and get him into a van that would take him to the ‘treatment center’ in another state. Sean, having been subjected to a similar treatment by his own parents had done more than enough to warn Davey, who fought as hard as he could. Mary Lou, hearing screaming and shouting, had entered the house and immediately called the police to come and sort things out. It was Pete who entered the scene and ended the chaos of that day. Sandy had called her mother in tears and the two of them had driven over immediately. By this time the police had arrived and Mary Lou was trying to figure out exactly what was going on there. Pete walked into the house while Monta went right to Sandy who was crying. Mary Lou, a shrewd judge of people, immediately focused on him. “Who are you?” She asked Pete. “I’m Sandy’s father.” Pete said gruffly as he eyed the woman. “Who are you?” “I’m Mary Lou Hacker, with Social Services.” She said and then quickly explained how she’d gotten involved. “Those idiots.” Pete grumbled at once, giving a glance over to where Sandy and David Sr. were sitting. Davey’s father looked offended, but stayed silent. “If the boy’s a queer, he’s a queer. Trying to beat it out of him ain’t gonna do no good.” “What do you mean?” Mary Lou asked him sharply. “The complaint is that he’s been rebellious, drinking, using drugs, and running away from home.” “Hah!” Pete laughed. “Sandy told the boy to get the hell out of her house when he told her he was a queer and he’s been staying with some good people since then. Hellfire, one of them works for Sandy!” “Not no more she doesn’t.” Sandy interjected at that point with an angry tone. “Your loss, girl.” Pete told her with no sympathy. “I’ll admit Davey had a little spell with drugs and alcohol a couple of years back and I was mighty worried about him, but since he met up with this new group of friends he’s finally gotten his life put back together, even if he’s decided he’s a queer. Hell, I can live with him being a queer if it means he ain’t going to piss his life away. There’s worse things in this world than fudgepackers.” That last he said with a glare at Davey’s father. “You’re saying he’s not a runaway?” Mary Lou asked Pete. “That’s what I said, lady.” Pete grumbled, hating to have to repeat himself. “As far as you know he hasn’t been using alcohol or drugs?” She pushed further. “Well, I know he’s had a beer when we go fishing, but just one.” Pete admitted gruffly. “Once in a while we’ll have some wine with dinner at Brian’s.” Davey added, gambling that honesty would win him more points rather than get him in trouble. “That’s definitely not alcohol abuse.” Mary Lou said with a sigh. “Now, what’s this about him being gay?” “I am gay.” Davey said sharply. “They don’t like that and they’ve been insisting I see this Christian counselor. They made up all the other shit so they could commit me the same as Sean’s parents did to him.” “Sean Rule?” Mary Lou asked with a sharp look at Davey. “Do you know him?” “He’s a friend of mine.” Davey said simply and she nodded. “The boy is lying.” The Pastor of First Baptist broke in at that point but he got a stony stare from Mary Lou in response and eventually closed his mouth. “Mr. Barrow, in your opinion is there any need for Davey to be committed?” Mary Lou asked his grandfather. “Hell no.” Pete said firmly. “Do you think you might be able to take him in while his case is reviewed by Social Services and he’s seen by a professional?” She asked. “Wait a minute!” Sandy exploded. “There’s no need for that.” Pete shook his head. “The boy has himself some good people to stay with where he has his own bedroom, which he wouldn’t have at my place. What’s more, he’s got money in a trust fund that Sandy set up, and she named me as the trustee on it so she can’t cut him off.” Sandy didn’t even bother trying to protest against her father. She just started crying again. Mary Lou took all that in, before nodding and suggesting that Pete call these ‘people’ so she could talk to them. An hour later, Davey was back at home, and I was holding him while he cried. We were all lucky that day. Somehow it stayed out of the local papers, and outside of the families involved, no one seemed to know what happened (except for our friends, of course). Davey was less than two months away from his eighteenth birthday, and so he got a lot of leeway that Social Services wouldn’t have been able to give him otherwise. It was the week before Christmas before Davey spoke to his parents again. Bev and Pete had harangued everyone until they had all agreed to apologize to Davey. What’s more, Bev had talked them into family counseling, with a counselor recommended by Mary Lou. By the end of the school year, they had all changed in some surprising ways. In February, Davey moved back in with his mother, at the same time that his father was invited to move into the home. Jenny had been the one to make the final call on that decision, and while she would forever be affected by what had happened to her, the family counseling had done a lot to heal her of the worst affects. She was a lot closer to the young woman I remembered her being than when I first had arrived in this timeline. High School Graduation came around far sooner than I had ever imagined possible. Davey and I celebrated together, along with our friends at a private party. The next day we spent a lot of time saying goodbye to our families in the typical teary-eyed farewells that happen when kids finally grow up and set off on their own. It was my father who drove us to San Francisco where we boarded a plane that took us on a two-hour flight. Todd, Sean, Brandon, and Trevor would all be following us to the same school, but they weren’t coming until later. Davey had insisted we share everything with them, and all of them had demanded they wanted to be a part of our plans. Trevor had turned down the USC scholarship and instead gotten one for ASU. Sean had qualified for several academic scholarships, as did Todd. Davey’s father, who was becoming more like the man I’d known as time passed and he mellowed out, was overjoyed that his son would be going to Arizona State University. The man had been born and raised in Phoenix, and was already planning a trip out to visit. Luckily he wasn’t planning on staying with us. With all of us pitching in together, we were more than able to afford an off-campus house. Truth be told, Davey and I could have afforded it by ourselves, but with all the others coming, there was no reason not to share. Together we leased a four-bedroom home that was six blocks from campus, and Davey’s mother had helped us furnish it. Her business had nearly collapsed when Mom and Bev quit, and I think at least some of the reconciliation with Davey had been to get those two women back to work with her. She’d been lonely without their company, and although she hated to admit it, she needed them far more than they needed the work. “Jesus it’s hot!” Davey murmured as we walked out of the air-conditioned baggage claim area. The heat hit us like a brick wall, and both of us immediately started sweating. I’d been to Phoenix a few times in the last timeline, mostly to visit Trevor and his family, but I’d never gotten use to this heat. “Just wait.” I mumbled. “It gets worse.” “Why the hell are we going to school here instead of somewhere colder?” Davey muttered as we hailed a taxi. Instead of answering I just gave him a withering glare and he had the grace to shrug off his own question. Fifteen minutes later we were at our new house, a fairly nice two-story home, and we unloaded our bags in the room that would be ours. “I bet our air-conditioning bills are going to be horrible.” Davey complained as the air conditioner brought the house down to a reasonable temperature. “Just during the summer, and it’ll only be the two of us most summers.” I reminded him. “Do you really think I can cram in enough classes to graduate in three years?” He asked me with a worried look. “If we both study hard, we can.” I assured him. “It will mean that we won’t be able to party as much as everyone else.” “You mean we won’t have as many opportunities to get in trouble.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “No thanks. With my luck I’d get drunk off my ass and thirty years later someone will come up with pictures of me puking on the sidewalk. I can live without all that shit.” “Glad to hear that.” I said with a smile. “As long as you and I get to fuck like bunnies.” He leered at me. “We’ve got an hour before we have to be on campus.” I reminded him. “You want to break the bed in?” “Let’s.” Davey said with a grin. We made it on-time, barely, to the special orientation the school had set up for the few freshmen who were getting an early start to their college education. It was a Saturday, and we had most of the afternoon to look around the school and surrounding area. On Sunday, we spent several hours on the phone to family and friends back in California, most of whom thought we were crazy for going to summer school. Then on Monday, we started our first day of classes. That summer wasn’t easy on either one of us. We had selected our courses for that first semester with great care. I had been through college before, and could remember what a difference it was from high school. In high school, much of the work was memorization of facts, dates, information, etc. with very little ‘opinion’ thrown in the mix. College was more about the ‘why’ and the ‘how’. That was why our first courses were the introductory political science course necessary for our major (International Relations) and the six-week intensive Russian Language course. ASU had one of the best Russian language courses in the nation, and many of their students were recruited by the U.S. State Department for work in their embassies and other facilities. The NSA also recruited heavily from the school, another reason for why I picked that school for undergraduate work. In many ways, it was better for what we wanted than the bigger-name Ivy League schools with more prestigious programs. After the first summer session, Davey was about ready to tear his hair out, and even I was tired. Still, we signed up for another intensive language course for the second summer session, which would put us a full year ahead in the foreign language requirements. We didn’t take any other course, and so by the time our one-week break between the second summer session and Fall semester arrived, we were both only half-crazy. Trevor showed up by himself several weeks into the second summer session for his football training camp, and complained non-stop about the heat. Davey’s parents, and his sister showed up for that one-week break, and we spent the entire time following his father around to all of his old haunts. The home he’d grown up in was now an apartment complex, but his school was still there. It was odd seeing his parents back as a couple, but both of them seemed happier. His father had used some of his wife’s lottery money to open up a rental car company in Modesto. Instead of focusing on just the rental car market, he also rented larger trucks and multi-purpose vehicles. After just a few months, he was already in negotiations to open franchises in three other towns in California. Jenny talked about going to ASU, but I had a feeling she was really thinking about going somewhere else for college. My parents made it out for the weekend, along with Brandon, Sean, and Todd. It was nice having our friends around again, although the late August thunderstorms put a damper on our sightseeing both Saturday and Sunday. Davey and I knew to do our runs very early in the morning, when the temperature might get down to a cool ninety degrees. Trevor did too, and we all laughed the one time our roommates tried to go running as late as eight in the morning when the temperature was inching into the mid-nineties and above. The first day of the regular semester started early for both Davey and me. Davey had an eight o’clock three-day a week political science course while I had a math course at the same time. Then there was an hour break for us before our five-day a week Russian 201 course. This was an important one, mostly because of the instructor, Professor Lee. The Professor was a tall man with a wild shock of white hair that still had a few streaks of brown in it. We actually had him for two courses, the grammar-focused 201 course, and the culture/speaking focused 211 course. He was also the professor for a two-day a week course on Soviet History that we were taking. It was part of the Soviet Studies Certificate that was highly prized by the U.S. State Department in potential employees. “Brian, and David, please stay after class for a moment.” He told us in Russian towards the end of the 201 course. After the bell rang, we waited and he nodded briefly to us. “I do not normally see freshmen in this course.” “We took the summer course.” Davey replied to the statement in the language it had been spoken in, Russian. His accent was still off, and the phrasing a bit clunky, but it sufficed. “Do you speak?” Professor Lee asked me. “Of course.” I replied, using the word konyechna. He smiled before grilling us for a few minutes to make sure we really did have a decent grasp of the language. “You will do fine.” He said with approval in English. “What other courses are you taking this semester?” “We are in your 211 course.” Davey answered. “And the Soviet History course as well.” I added. “How interesting.” He said in Russian before switching back to English. “Are you going to major in Russian?” “International Relations with the certificate in Soviet Studies”. Davey answered. “I’ll probably take all four years of language though.” “Same with you?” He asked me and I shook my head. “I’m majoring in Economics with a minor in Russian and of course the Soviet Studies.” I answered. He cocked his head. “Interesting choice.” He said. “Why?” “I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think that within five years the Soviet Union will no longer exist.” I stated in English with a shrug. He just blinked. “What gives you that idea?” He asked slowly and carefully, as if speaking to someone he was worried might go crazy at the drop of a hat. “Gorbachev’s reforms are a starting point.” Davey began our argument. He and I had been over this time and again over the last year. Oddly, it was our favorite topic after sex, and we’d spent a lot of time lying in bed, the room smelling like sex, and discussed the end of the Cold War. “He’s playing with fire in a forest that hasn’t seen a drop of rain in seventy years. Sure, he’s dug a fire pit, ringed it with stones, and is trying to clear away any nearby underbrush, but he doesn’t realize that all it’s going to take are a few gusts of wind and a few sparks, and there’s going to be a forest fire so big nothing can stop it from burning down the forest of communism.” “Nice alliteration.” The Professor said with a slight smile. It was a good alliteration. Davey always had a way with words. “I think it will start in the Eastern European Republics.” I added. “Most likely it’ll be Poland that starts the ball rolling. Solidarity is gaining in strength, even if it is still mostly underground and being supported by the CIA and the Catholic Church. From there it’ll probably head to Hungary, and eventually to Germany. That will really be the death knell of communism, if Germany can reunite.” “Hard-line communists in Russia will probably try to stop it from happening, maybe even try to take down Gorbachev.” Davey added. “But, it’ll be too late.” “That’s what we think, at least.” I said with a shrug. “If you think this, why are you studying Russian and the Soviet Union?” The Professor asked. “If you’re right, any careers you might have planned will not really be needed.” “Russia, and the former communist states will need to adjust to a post-communist form of governing.” I said with aplomb. “They’ll need to learn the basics of a capitalist economy, and they’ll want advice. There will be plenty of opportunities for work, and for making money.” “I think I’m going to enjoy having you two in my classes.” He said after shaking his head. “Maybe we’ll find a few holes to poke in your theories. The Soviet Union has been around a long time, and they’ve gone through periods of reform before. I’ll want you to pay close attention to the sections between Lenin and Stalin, and the Khrushchev years.” “Thank you.” I said with a nod of my head while Davey smiled at him. We talked for a few more minutes before heading out for lunch. Todd was shaking his head after his first lessons in Arabic. Sean was babbling about something from his physics class, Trevor talked about football, and Brandon was mostly silent. Of all of us, his courses in Computer Science were the least developed at this school, and he could have done a lot better by going somewhere else, but this was the school that seemed to allow us all the best opportunity to attend as a group. Our first year in school was tiring for all of us. While no one else was taking eighteen units like Davey and I were, we all had a great deal of focus on our studies. Trevor, Brandon, and Todd attended a few parties, and Trevor was offered to pledge one of the fraternities, but he turned them down. Because we were all in fairly steady relationships, we did a lot less partying than most freshmen, and were slower in making new friends. That wasn’t to say we didn’t have new friends. Of all of us, Trevor was in the most delicate situation. He played ASU football, and they were a team that got a lot of attention. There was intense pressure on him to have a girlfriend, but he quietly refused and people quickly began to realize what was up when they always saw him in Todd’s company. One of the coaches even pulled Trevor aside and made a few ‘suggestions’ that Trevor didn’t even pause to consider. “You’ll never be picked up professionally if you don’t at least play that game.” The Coach warned him. Since I remembered Trevor as having fallen in love, gotten married and having kids with a woman, I was surprised by how he stuck with Todd. Not that it was a bad thing. It was just unexpected. “You know, I could dump Todd and date women, maybe even get married.” Trevor said after he’d come back from that meeting with one of the coaches. We were alone in the house, since Davey and the others had all gone out to see a movie. I’d stayed behind to re-work an essay for my English Lit course. Having lived a whole lifetime already didn’t necessarily provide any assistance when it came to writing this damn essay, and Trevor wanting to talk was a good diversion. “Why don’t you?” I asked him. “I know you’ve always dreamed of being in the NFL, and it’ll be next to impossible if you don’t at least appear to be hetero.” “Do you think I should?” He asked me with a raised eyebrow. “Are you happy with Todd?” I asked him. “I mean, you know most high school romances don’t last forever.” “Look at Davey’s parents.” Trevor countered with a shrug. “His mom married his dad right out of high school, and then he went and did all that shit. Now they’re back together and planning their re-marriage during winter break. Look at my parents. They met in college and they’re still together.” “But do you think that you and Todd have what it takes to last that long?” I asked him. “The last timeline, you and Davey lasted that long, didn’t you?” He asked me. “Yes.” I agreed. “Do you think the two of you will last that long again?” He asked. “I mean, for you it’s going to be two lifetimes with the same man. Don’t you get bored?” “No.” I said emphatically. “I could never get bored with Davey.” “I don’t think I could get bored with Todd, either.” Trevor stated. “He’s fun to be with, and we’re constantly doing things together. He loves football, or at least watching it, and we both love music. There are so many things we have in common, and some things we don’t. It’s like we fit together.” “Okay, if it makes you happy, then I say go for it and damn the consequences.” I told him with a smile. “You know, I think that might have had something to do with me coming back in time. I was looking at the end. Davey was probably already dead, and we’d had such good times together that I didn’t want it to end. So I came back to start over again, to have another lifetime with him.” “Kind of selfish, huh?” Trevor said with a smile. “You say you came back to save the world, but you really came back just to be young enough to pork Davey for another sixty years.” “I’ve been caught at last!” I laughed and we both chuckled before he went to find something to do while I went back to that damn essay. Was I really that selfish? Well, maybe I was, but then a part of me believed that Davey had come back over and over again for me, so why shouldn’t I come back for him? Chapter 19 “Remind me why we’re doing this again?” Davey asked with a heavy sigh as we sat down for lunch. It was a little restaurant just off of Indian School Road, and we both were tired, sweaty, and hungry. We managed to get a sneer from the waiter when he saw the t-shirts we were wearing, but he took our order just the same. “Because it’s important to build the right connections from the beginning.” I reminded him as the waiter left. “You know I support the other guy, right?” He leaned in and whispered with a conspiratorial smile. “Even after all the crap that I told you about in other timelines?” I asked him and he frowned before shaking his head. “I don’t believe I’m really a Democrat.” Davey muttered for the fiftieth time. “Wait until 1992.” I assured him and he shook his head again. Sure, Dukakis lost, and he lost big, and here in Arizona he was wildly unpopular, but working on the campaign built up credibility for later. Davey and I weren’t talking in the fall of 1986, so he hadn’t worked with me on the California gubernatorial election, but I’d been there with bells on. “I know, I know.” Davey said with a sigh. Walking precincts was the basic level of work, along with phone banking, and we were doing both for the doomed Dukakis for President campaign. It helped build credibility for things I wanted to happen down the road, and in Arizona, along with a few thousand dollars in contributions from our trust funds, it had gotten us delegate positions to the national Dem convention this year. Todd and Trevor showed up before we ordered, and they both griped at me for talking them into this. Brandon and Sean both were phone banking today, and probably getting nasty comments and hang-ups, just like we were getting doors slammed in our faces. Four years from now it’d be a totally different story, but this was the here and now, and besides we likely wouldn’t be in Arizona then. After lunch, it was back into the one hundred plus degree heat for more precinct walking. Sure, it was late September, but the heat lingered here well into October sometimes. It was days like this one that made me think I’d picked the wrong school. Dinner reaffirmed my having made the right choice, though, as we showed up at Professor Lee’s house. It was a private dinner, with some of his fellow professors, two graduate students, and then Davey and I. While we were technically in our second ‘year’ of attending college, both Davey and I had accumulated enough credits that we were on the border between Sophomore and Junior status. It wasn’t exactly easy going on either of us. Davey had nearly had a mental breakdown over the summer, and so we’d taken a lighter load for the second half of summer. The truth was I needed that lighter class load too. Then, instead of visiting family in Modesto, we’d taken off for Hawaii and spent nearly two weeks there before the fall semester started. We’d returned a little more tanned, and a lot more relaxed. After dinner, we were sitting around Professor Lee’s living room, sipping cognac and discussing some of the finer points of Stalin’s Five-Year Plan when the Professor got around to the purpose of the dinner. It wasn’t the first dinner we’d been to at his house, and we were always the only undergraduates there, although he had thrown a big party at the end of the year for all of his Russian language students. He had these dinners at least once a month, though. The difference was that he’d just hosted one two weeks ago. “Brian, Davey, I hope you remember the discussion we had when you first came to Arizona State about what you see as the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union.” Professor Lee began, and there was actually a few giggles from the graduate students. “Yes, Professor.” I said while Davey cautiously nodded. “You two did a joint report for me last year where you provided some good supporting facts.” Professor Vikten, a wrinkled, bald man in his late sixties added with a nod towards us. “You had quite a lot of interesting facts in there that I have never seen added up quite that way before. It was either a work of genius or sheer stupidity.” That got more giggles, and a few chuckles from the other professors in the room while Davey blushed and I tried not to laugh. Knowing the Soviet Union was going to collapse, and why it did from evidence after its fall was one thing. Trying to find the evidence to point to it beforehand, without talking about time travel, or having access to classified information was even more difficult. Thankfully the library here kept up to date on a lot of periodicals that had the information we needed for the paper. “I hope you thought it was genius because we both got an A on it.” I finally said after getting the urge to laugh under control. This time there was a lot more open laughter. “Yes, whether it was right or wrong, it was well researched and well written.” He praised us, and from him it was high praise. “It was well written enough that it formed the core of a grant request that we submitted over the summer.” Professor Lee added and this time I was surprised. I had not expected that. “The grant has been approved, and we are forming the research group that will work on the grant. All the people here tonight have expertise in the areas we need, and the idea came from the two of you. I took the liberty of submitting your names to the government already, and the preliminary security clearances were approved for both of you, despite, um well I believe we do not need to go into that.” That did surprise me a bit. It wasn’t until Bill Clinton took office that the rules were changed regarding gay people having security clearances. In this time, merely being gay usually classified someone as a security risk and they would not be given any sort of security clearance by the government. Some strings must have been pulled on this, and it showed I had indeed picked the right school. “We’re going to be studying the economic conditions in Eastern Europe with a focus on how it might bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Davey asked in the silence that followed. “Are you sure we can contribute to that?” “You’re both four-oh students, this was your idea to begin with, and your research papers have shown you know how to conduct proper research.” Professor Vikten said bluntly. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you both were graduate students already. You will of course receive a small stipend, not that either of you need it from what I hear, and you will receive course credit for your work, as upper-division credit. Is it correct that you’re both only taking eighteen units this semester?” “Only eighteen?” One of the graduate students gasped. “That’s right.” I confirmed. “It was getting a little bit much for us over the summer so we decided to lighten the load a bit. It’ll mean graduating after summer school in ’91 instead of Spring ’91, but it’s better than having a breakdown.” “Yes, it is.” Vikten agreed. “Do you think you can handle the extra work if you join us on the grant team?” “We can.” Davey said excitedly. I nodded my agreement. “Good, then let’s start talking details.” Professor Lee said as he finished off his drink and started into the details of what the grant covered, and what each person’s role would be. Honestly, it was more than I could have hoped for, although some of the preliminary conclusions would come too late, I knew, at least it’d be on record that we were part of the team predicting the fall of the Soviet Union when it actually collapsed. A problem cropped up the next week though, when two FBI agents interviewed Davey and me separately. In my interview, it quickly became apparent that the agent didn’t like gay people, and didn’t believe either of us should have a security clearance of any type. Most of the information we would have access to was economic in nature, not military, but it still was sensitive information. “You’re a homosexual.” The agent, a middle-aged man in a dark suit said as he sat across from me at a small table. He looked unpleasant in the extreme. “Yes.” I answered simply and honestly. “Homosexuals can’t be trusted with government secrets.” He stated succinctly and started to stand up. “Why not?” I asked him calmly and he looked at me with a little surprise at the challenge to his statement. “You’re too easy to blackmail.” He grunted. “Blackmail?” I laughed softly. “What is there to blackmail me about?” “The communists could threaten to reveal your perversion publicly.” He said sourly. “Hmmm.” I said while tapping my finger on my chin. “Who would they threaten to reveal it to that would scare me? I just told you, an FBI agent, that I was gay. My parents know. My friends know. My professors know, and many students I go to classes with know or at least suspect. They could shout it from the rooftops, take an ad out in the New York Times, or announce it on television for all I care. How can they use it to blackmail me when I don’t care who knows?” “They could seduce you.” He said flatly. “They could seduce anyone.” I pointed out. “It’s a constant threat, isn’t it? That someone with sensitive information will fall into bed with an agent and give up everything they know for love. Sorry, but I already have someone I love. We’re in a relationship together, and we have been for years. I’m not going to risk that for some random romp in the hay no matter how cute the guy might be.” “It’s easy to say that, but reality is different.” He said. “You’re a guy, a guy who sleeps with other guys. Fidelity isn’t in your nature.” “You don’t know me well enough to say that.” I snapped. “You’re married, and you’re a guy. Aren’t you a risk because some pretty woman might try to seduce you? That happens all the time in this country, you know. Married men cheating on their spouses.” “Don’t try to switch this back on me.” He fumed, but he looked like he was at least thinking. “The purpose of an investigation for a security clearance is to determine if the person will be a risk, right?” I asked him in a neutral tone. “It’s your job to find out as much about me as you can to help you decide if I will reveal classified information to people who should not have it.” “Your explanation is a little simplistic.” He said, but he wasn’t hostile. “How thorough have you been?” I asked him with a raised eyebrow. “What about that bitch, Marcie? Do you have that incident in my file?” “Your ex-girlfriend who tried to trap you into marrying her.” He grumbled. “So you’re not really a homosexual, are you?” “More bi-sexual, but I’m in a homosexual relationship and never plan to leave that relationship.” I shrugged. “I don’t get how you can just blabber about being a pervert.” He grumbled. “You know, I could arrest you for violating the sodomy laws here in this state. How can I give someone who is knowingly breaking state law a security clearance?” “Can the FBI arrest me for violating a state law?” I asked him. “Well I can have you arrested by a state trooper.” He corrected. “The Supreme Court just upheld sodomy laws in Texas a few years ago.” “Yes, I know.” I smiled. “Um, have I admitted to having sexual intercourse in violation of the law?” “You’ve said you were a homosexual.” He stated. “But did I admit to any sexual activity while in the state of Arizona?” I pushed. “No.” He frowned. “So you can’t have me arrested for violating state sodomy laws when I haven’t admitted to violating them.” I pointed out. “Just being gay doesn’t mean I have to have sex here in this state. Davey and I could drive across the border to California if we want and it’s perfectly legal there.” “This is getting us nowhere.” He groused. “No it isn’t.” I agreed. “If you believe I’m a security risk, deny me clearance. All I ask is that you base it on a real judgment about me, not because you believe I’m a pervert. Which I disagree with, by the way.” “Fine.” He grumbled. Davey’s interview went much the same as mine, except Davey really tore into his agent who got decidedly uncomfortable at a few things. My lover’s luck was with him as always, and he had been able to guess the man was a closet case. He’d used that mercilessly to rake the poor agent over the coals without flat out saying he was sure the man was a closet case. The next day word came down that we had received our clearances. Normally we would have gone to the game that night and cheered our school’s team on (and Trevor), but Davey and I wanted a private celebration. I cooked a romantic dinner for two, and we ate over a candlelit table. These moments were important for both of us, because they helped keep our relationship as more than simple friendship. Sean hadn’t gone either since he had a class tonight. After dinner, we put the plates in the dishwasher and moved upstairs to our room, the master bedroom for the house. We had moved Davey’s king-size waterbed out here, and on nights like this one, I was glad I’d insisted we get one of the new wave-less water mattresses. We must have spent a good half-hour doing nothing more than kissing and slowly undressing each other, covering each other’s bodies with our hands and our mouths. Making love with Davey was always different. Sometimes it was quick and dirty, and other times, like tonight it was slow and sensual. We’d achieved another victory, overcoming the homophobic prejudices of the FBI agents, and that made our lovemaking all the sweeter. An hour after we’d begun, I was buried deep inside Davey, his legs over my shoulders, and he was leaning up so we could kiss while I fucked him with long, slow strokes. Everything was so perfect, and that was when the door to our bedroom flew open. We were playing Davey’s radio, one of Asia’s albums in case Sean came home after class and so we hadn’t heard the noises of the black-clad officers entering our house. Until they surrounded us with weapons drawn and pointed at us, we didn’t even know they were in the house. “What the fuck?” Davey yelled at the interruption, and I felt a moment of fear. Had the FBI agents set this up so they could try and get a prosecution of us under the state’s sodomy laws? Would the state even bother prosecuting it since it could result in bad publicity. “Uh, you both need to get dressed.” One of the officers in the black swat gear, his face hidden by a ski mask and his helmet, said in a voice that almost sounded like he was on the verge of laughing. “What’s going on here?” I demanded as I pulled out of Davey. Already I’d gone soft, but I made no move to cover myself. I’d be damned if I’d let these motherfuckers think I was ashamed. “You need to come with us, immediately.” The same officer said in a slightly calmer voice. “Are you arresting us?” Davey demanded as he raised himself up on his elbows and glared at them. “On what charge?” “You’re not under arrest.” The agent said as he signaled with his hands for the other men to leave the room. A few of them were snickering, and one was muttering something that sounded a little disgusted, but that was all. “We’re actually here for your protection, by order of the President of the United States.” “What?” Davey exclaimed in surprise while I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I immediately suspected that somehow, our secret had gotten out. With a sigh I nodded at the officer. “Can you give us a moment to get dressed?” I asked him. “I’m not supposed to let either of you out of my sight.” He said with amusement in his voice. “How much time do we have?” I asked him, trying to think quickly. “Could we take a quick shower so we don’t smell wherever we’re going?” “As long as you leave the bathroom door open and don’t take too long.” He said after thinking for a moment. “C’mon Davey.” I said to my lover. “We’ll shower together to save time.” “Okay.” Davey said in a shaky voice as we got off the bed and headed into the bathroom, leaving the door open. As the hot water gave us a little privacy, I leaned in to whisper to him. “I think somehow they know about time travel.” I whispered. “No shit.” Davey murmured. “What else would get us this much attention? The shit in Eastern Europe doesn’t happen for several more months. How could they know and how in hell do they even believe it?” “We’ll probably find out soon enough.” I said. “We don’t have all night.” The officer called from the doorway, and we finished the shower in a hurry. When we were both dry and headed over to the dresser to pull out some underwear, he spoke again. “You might want to dress comfortably and pack a bag or two with some nicer clothes in them. It’s a little cold where you’re going.” “Where are we going?” Davey asked as he slipped on a pair of red bikini briefs I had bought for him. He looked so damn good in them. “Let’s just say back east.” The officer said with a shrug. “There’s a plane flying in to Sky Harbor right now to pick you and the others up at the National Guard hangar.” “Can we leave a note for our roommates?” I asked as I pulled on a pair of white briefs and a t-shirt. Davey was already pulling out white socks, dress socks, extra t-shirts, and our ties. I went over to the closet and pulled out two pairs of jeans, some polo shirts, and two light jackets that we almost never used here in Arizona. We were dressed quickly, and while Davey packed the small clothes in to a duffel bag, I put some dress clothes into a garment bag. “There’s no need for that.” The officer said. “You almost done?” “We’re done.” Davey said as I zipped up the garment bag and folded it over for transport. “Good, you don’t waste any time.” The man said as he waved for us to lead the way out of the room. We moved in a circle of armed men as we left the house and got into several vans marked with ATF and DEA. I noticed a large group of onlookers, mostly fellow college students and wondered what stories would circulate now. Probably how we were drug dealers or something, since it was the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I did notice that several regular Tempe Police officers were standing guard outside the house as we pulled away. Davey and I were in the back of one of the vans, and once inside we could see nothing. We were alone here, and Davey’s hand found mine, squeezing it tightly. “What do we do now?” He asked me in a scared voice. “I don’t know.” I admitted. “This wasn’t something I’d planned for, really.” “Then you’ll want me to take the lead, eh?” He asked with a little smile. “You’re always saying I think better on my feet.” “You do, love.” I assured him, and part of me actually relaxed a little. Having Davey stepping up to the plate like this, where it would be me leaning on him for a bit was nice. It felt more like the old relationship I’d had with the other Davey, the more experienced Davey. Fifteen minutes later the doors of the van were open, and we got out at the airport. We were in front of the National Guard hangar, and quickly escorted inside. That was where we found the rest of our friends waiting for us. Poor Trevor was still in his football uniform, although he’d managed to ditch his shoulder pads. Brandon had the red and gold paint he’d worn to the game still on his face, as did Todd. Sean was standing with them, talking quietly with them as we arrived. “We brought some clothes for you.” The agent who’d spoken in the house said and I noticed for the first time that a few of the agents had some familiar-looking duffel bags. Trevor let out a sigh of relief, although he looked damn hot in his football uniform. “Took you guys long enough.” Brandon muttered as we joined our friends. “Hey! Your hair is wet! You got to take a shower! That’s not fair!” “Yeah, well, since Brian was plowing my ass when they broke in, I think it’s better we don’t smell like sex.” Davey murmured. “Oh shit, you guys were bumping when they showed up?” Todd laughed while Sean chortled before frowning. “Sorry.” Sean said. “I… I didn’t remember what you guys were doing tonight. Hell, I wasn’t even sure what night it was.” “You came back in time!” Davey exclaimed in a startled voice. “Keep it down.” Sean said quietly. From their reactions, our other friends had already been told. Brandon was giving him a slightly odd look. “Which Sean are you?” I asked quietly with narrowed eyes. “Huh?” Sean asked with a look of confusion. “Are you the Sean from my timeline, this timeline, or another timeline?” I asked him. “I’m the Sean from this timeline, or what was this timeline until I created a new one by coming back.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “The fucking scientist.” Davey growled. “You’re studying physics now so you can get in with him and keep an eye on him. That’s the plan.” “Yeah, and it kind of worked.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “I’m going to go get changed. Wait until I get back. Sean hasn’t told us much more than that.” Trevor said as he headed off. “Excuse me gentlemen.” The agent who’d talked to me before came over to us. He was no longer wearing his ski mask. “There’s a shower facility here if you would like to utilize it before your plane arrives. You will need to be quick, no more than fifteen minutes.” “Hold the explanations, I’m going to get cleaned up.” Brandon said firmly, giving Sean a penetrating look. “I promise.” Sean said softly and then waited until Brandon and Todd followed one of the agents into a side room. “Damn I’d forgotten how suspicious he could be at this age. Jesus, you weren’t lying when you said you could remember everything better after going back, Brian.” “Yes, well I want to know why, scratch that, first I want to know how you did it.” I said firmly. “Sean, the other timeline’s Sean, he swore it would be next to impossible to beat the jamming device.” “From all the stories you’ve told me about time travel, you should know by know that it’s always up to me to come back and save yours and Davey’s butts.” Sean said with a slight smile and then he frowned. “Ouch.” “Are you hurt?” Davey asked in a worried tone. “Not now, but the crystal-clear memory does have a downside.” Sean answered with a frown as he ran a hand along his flat belly. “Getting shot three times really does hurt, and remembering it as clear as day really sucks.” “I can imagine.” I said with a shake of my head. “So, you came back in time…” “I’m not going to say anything until they get back, Brian.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “Brandon is really big on people keeping their promises, remember? I fucked up one time too many and he dumped me ten years ago. I’ve got a chance to fix that and I’m starting now. If I tell him I’m going to do something, I’m damn well going to do it.” “That’s fair.” Davey said with a stern look at me. He didn’t need to give me that look, but neither did I protest. Sean had a good reason. I hadn’t told him about the breakup between Sean and Brandon in my own timeline, but it had been because of something similar. Everyone was back, dressed in casual clothes, and cleaned up by the time a sleek business jet pulled up in front of the hangar. It had Air Force markings, and a Lieutenant Colonel got out as soon as the plane’s door was open. He had a brief discussion with the agent in charge, and we were quickly bustled aboard. “Gentlemen, please take a seat.” The officer said as we entered the fairly well-appointed jet. There were eight seat, and the Lt. Colonel took one near the front after the rest of us were seated and buckled in. “If anyone’s hungry, the steward will prepare a meal as soon as we’re airborne, or you can just have a snack and something to drink. I haven’t been briefed on why you’re flying to Washington, and was given strict instructions to pass along that there should be no discussion of the reason for your flight. We will be met at Andrews by some people from NSA, CIA, FBI, and DoD who will then debrief you.” “Well, there goes the chance at an explanation.” Davey muttered sourly from the seat next to me. I reached out and squeezed his hand while the plane taxied for an immediate take off. Flying across country was never short, but the plane rumbled with the sounds of its engines going at maximum speed the entire way. I was far too nervous to sleep, and did not feel like joining in on the conversation the other guys started up. Apparently Trevor had been pulled off the sidelines where he was waiting his opportunity to get in the game (he was the backup quarterback still) when two police officers had come up and talked to him at the same time as several more officers found the others in the stands. They’d been taken directly to the hangar where Sean was waiting for them, and there had been only a brief opportunity for him to explain he was from the future, our future, before we’d shown up. Something must have gone really, really wrong. My plans had included placing Sean with the scientist who had first invented time travel in order to keep an eye on him. Sean had agreed to this readily. With the jammer in place, it should have looked like the time travel theory was wrong, and the scientist should have been discouraged, or at least his funders should have been discouraged enough to stop funding his experiments. Apparently that had not happened. The entire trip my mind tried to figure out what exactly had gone wrong. Sean was only a few feet away, but I knew better than to try to get him to tell me with the officer so close. He would follow his orders as all good military men do, and would stop any such conversation before it had more than started. There were unmarked vans waiting for us as we landed at Andrews, and I wasn’t surprised that we were being taken to the Pentagon. What exactly had Sean already told them, and more importantly how had he gotten them to believe him so quickly? We all rode in one van, and with a partition between us and the driver, we could at last talk. “So, you’ve got a lot of questions, right?” Sean asked. “In case you haven’t placed the timing right, everyone here knows your role was to be keeping an eye on the crazy scientist.” I stated and he nodded. “Yeah, I figured that.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “They do tend to get jumbled up at first, don’t they? They’re all so clear and fresh. Well, anyway, your plan’s a good one, Brian, as far as it goes. By 2004, the scientist was ready to try his experiments again, and they didn’t work. The Russian guy pulled his funding at first, and the scientist folded up shop. Then two years later he calls me and said he’d made a breakthrough and gotten more funding. I, of course, volunteered to help him out again, except it was a trap.” “A trap?” Davey asked. “Yeah, somehow he’d figured out about the jamming, and he figured out a counter to it.” Sean stated. “Something about the jamming reminded him of some calculations I’d done when I’d worked with him, and he was waiting for me with the Russian, who’d brought a couple of hired thugs with him. Since I’d called you all beforehand, you were waiting outside, ready to storm in and stop things before they went too far. That part didn’t go too well. They were ready to send someone back, and they were just making sure there weren’t other traps. I’m sorry, but they got the truth out of me with some drugs that had me kind of loopy.” “It happens.” I shrugged. “Yeah, well let’s just say the firefight of you guys trying to break in didn’t go too well.” Sean grimaced. “Their thugs were better than us, mostly I guess since none of us really had any military training. Davey did best, wounding the last thug before the guy killed him.” “Ouch.” Davey grimaced. “Yeah, I got hit in the process too.” Sean added, rubbing his stomach again. “So anyway, the scientist went back first as a test. Shevardnadze had a goon assistant who sent him back. When they verified it was successful, the goon sent Shevardnadze back. I was lying there pretty much bleeding to death. They thought I was dead and ignored me. At first, I was just to out of it to really understand what was happening, and by the time I figured out I had to do something, Shevardnadze had gone back. I got the goon with Davey’s gun, and set the time machine on auto before dumping out Shevardnadze’s body and climbing in myself.” “You came back in the middle of class?” I asked with a little confusion. “The machine is supposed to pick a period where you’re asleep…” “I fell asleep in class.” Sean mumbled with a red face. That got all of us to laugh. I seemed to remember Davey having done something similar on one of his trips back in time. “When I woke up, I went right for the nearest phone. I called Mr. Rush like you’d told me, and explained things to him. Somehow he believed me, and more importantly, he got the right people in government to believe him.” “That would make sense.” I said with a look at the surprised Trevor. “He does have many of the right contacts.” “Well, Shevardnadze and the scientist have been back here in time now for three months.” Sean said. “I don’t know for sure if they’ve done anything overt or not, but they could be planning on taking us out.” “How do they know about me?” I asked with a raised eyebrow and Sean ducked his head. “It was one of the things they tricked out of me.” He mumbled as the van pulled to a stop. The door opened a moment later, and a group of soldiers along with a three-star General were waiting for us. Sean and I got out first, and the General frowned at us. “This better not be someone’s idea of a practical joke.” He grumbled to us. “I wish it was.” Sean retorted and the General nodded. “If you will follow me, we’ve got some people waiting inside to have a little chat with the lot of you.” He said in a tone that left no room for argument. Davey squeezed my hand as we followed the senior officer deep into the bowels of the Pentagon. Once again the world had taken a turn for the worse. Could we put it back on the right track? Chapter 20 “I’m tired.” Davey said to me as I entered the medium-sized room that had been hastily turned into sleeping quarters for all of us. Six cot-beds had been arranged with typical military wool blankets and thin pillows. Davey and the others, except Sean, had gotten here first and already the six cots were now arranged in pairs right next to each other. Our bags were at the foot of each set of cots. “So am I.” I said softly, knowing full well our hosts would be listening to every conversation in this room. It was just after two in the morning by the time our interviewers had called a break. Already I’d been through the basic outline of my story, and filled in quite a few details about my plans for this timeline without giving away too many details about the future, or my original timeline. Davey and I sat down on the cots he’d claimed for us while I looked over to where Trevor and Todd were asleep already, and Brandon was half-dozing as he waited for Sean. “Did they say what time they were going to come get us again?” Davey asked around a wide yawn. “Five o’clock for me.” I answered sourly. That was less than three hours away. “Well, let’s get some sleep.” He said as the door opened again and Sean came into the room. Brandon got up and made a beeline for him. They hugged, as Davey and I had, and then chatted quietly before settling down together on their cots. We knew better than to try and trade notes between us. There had always been a possibility that something like this would happen, and we had planned for it in detail. We all knew what to say, and what not to say. Above all, we were always to tell the truth, and if something should not be answered, just refuse to answer it at all. Questions like “Who will win this year’s election?” would be readily answered, while questions about 1992 would receive no comment whatsoever. What the goals of other time travelers were would also be readily answered, but questions about what happens in 2000, or other years would be met with silence. So far, they were going rather easy on us, although the lack of sleep we were going to experience was deliberate. It was precisely five in the morning when we were woken up and taken for a quick breakfast in another room. Then we were shown to a shower that at least helped us wake up a little more before they once again separated us for individual questioning. Some people might have bothered complaining about the treatment, but I knew it was actually rather mild compared to what could be happening right now. “Mr. Breckenridge, please have a seat.” A middle-aged man I had not met before said as I entered the interview room with two soldiers waiting outside as guards. The room had a small table, and six chairs. Five of those chairs were occupied, and I sat in the sixth. None of the men, and they were all men, were those who had questioned me into the early hours of the morning, but I recognized two of them from another timeline. “Mr. Hoskins, Mr. Thornbull, it’s a pleasure to see you.” I said to the two of them and enjoyed the shocked looked on their faces. “You know these men?” the first man who had spoken asked. “Yes, and no.” I said with a slight smile while openly yawning. At least I was twenty now instead of eighty, where the short amount of sleep would have left me stupid with mental fatigue. “I knew them in my previous timeline, but I’ve never met them in the here and now. Mr. Hoskins would have been working in the State Department around this time, if memory serves, and Mr. Thornbull was an expert at the Hungary desk in the CIA.” “Your memory is accurate, Mr. Breckenridge.” The first man said while everyone looked startled while making notes. “Frankly I didn’t know what to believe this morning as I read through the transcripts of your debriefing last night. I trust you got at least some sleep?” “Not enough, but I’ll sleep when there’s more time.” I said with a shrug. “We have a lot of work to do, I believe.” “I am Will Lerner, and I work for the White House.” He said with a nod. “You already know Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Thornbull, and you were right about their current assignments. With Mr. Hoskins from State is Mr. Eldridge, and from the Department of Defense is Mr. Wolfowitz.” “I thought I recognized you, sir.” I said to the last man. Maybe I was more tired than I thought. He was a man I should have recognized, but then again I’d never actually met him in person. “You must imagine how skeptical we all are about what you and Mr. Rule claim to be.” Lerner said carefully. “Still, you have both shared knowledge that should not be known to college students, and given enough examples to lend credibility to your claims. We have some more questions for you this morning.” “Please, I will answer what I can.” I stated. “Good, now why are you refusing to answer certain questions?” Wolfowitz started aggressively, leaning forward as he asked. “Certain questions of a political nature I will refuse to answer.” I shrugged. “I’m not going to see time travel information used for the personal gain of certain individuals.” “But you’ll use it for your own personal gain?” Wolfowitz countered. “Did you not use your knowledge to buy a winning ticket for your… lover’s mother?” “Yes.” I admitted. “Did you not plan to do something similar with an even bigger lottery in the near future?” He continued. “Yes.” I admitted. “So you’ll use your knowledge for your own personal gain, but not for anyone else?” Wolfowitz spoke in clipped tones. “Isn’t that hypocritical?” “Yes, but I’ve never claimed I could not be hypocritical.” I said with a shrug. “But there’s more to it than just financial gain. This country faces issues, and days ahead, that are vastly different than what we are accustomed to facing today. In past timelines, we were ill prepared to adjust our worldview to the new paradigms as they arose. As a result, we stumbled badly in our foreign policy decisions and greatly hurt American interests even though we thought we were doing the right thing. The lottery winnings will be used to help establish a foundation that will hopefully, over the course of several decades, help our country adjust to the changing world and not make the same mistakes. I certainly do not want to see the United States held hostage by foreign nukes planted off our shores, or our soldiers chased out of once-friendly countries.” “And you believe you’re wise enough to make these kinds of decisions?” Lerner asked. “I’ve worked for the United Nations, and the U.S. State Department, as well as on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for most of my adult life.” I replied with a very slight shrug. “For sixty years I was heavily involved in this nation’s foreign relations. For ten years I was the spouse of the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and turned down two direct offers of Ambassadorships for myself. Two different U.S. Presidents asked me to be their Secretary of State, and I refused both times.” “Or so you claim.” Wolfowitz spat out. “We’ve just met, gentlemen, but you will find that nothing I’ve told you so far, or will likely tell you anytime soon is a lie.” I countered. “Proving you’re a time traveler isn’t the easiest thing in the world, nor is knowing how to make the most effective use of information. Sure, it’s possible to change things like who becomes President in a given election, but doing that does not necessarily fix long-term problems. To really fix long-term problems requires a different approach than any real, direct change to the timeline.” “But you are not the only time traveler.” Lerner pointed out. “Not anymore, which is why I’m sharing so much with you now.” I said with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “The Russian time traveler does not have the experience with previous timelines that I have.” “But you claim this is the first time you’ve actually traveled in time.” Hoskins pointed out. “That is true.” I answered. “My husband though, had experienced several different timelines. We were together for around seventy years, and during that time I learned a lot about his experiences. Sean, a different Sean if you will remember, had experienced a similar number of alternate timelines and also contributed to my understanding of the complexities of time travel and changing the future.” “You’ve stated the goal of the Russian time traveler is to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Eldridge spoke up for the first time. “Yes.” I confirmed. “You’ll know better than I how effective we were at changing what happens after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Mr. Shevardnadze was the original funder of time travel that started all of this. His goal then, and I cannot imagine it has changed, was to prop up the Soviet Union and keep it alive past 1991. I would imagine his first steps will be to replace Gorbachev, and to stop the relatively free parliamentary elections in Hungary and Poland early next year.” “Mr. Rule’s debriefing mentioned those events and stated that your efforts to ameliorate the effects of the collapse were less than successful.” Wolfowitz said in a tone of superiority. “I’m still in college, I can’t expect to be able to shift the course of the planet just yet.” I shrugged. “It takes time.” “That’s pretty much what he said.” Lerner noted. “He says that your plans were largely focused on the world after the turn of the century, and even after the first decade of the next century.” “That would be accurate.” I agreed. “My goal isn’t to see any specific person elected or not elected, but to change how we look at the world and our role in the world. Hopefully, people will look at the situation differently, and make different choices, but ultimately it will still be up to them to choose. I will not use my knowledge to force change.” “That is a fine line to walk.” Lerner said with a frown. “Still, you are right about the Soviet time traveler. We are hearing rumblings that a coup is happening as we speak. When we first received Mr. Rule’s strange call, we at first didn’t fully believe it, but we did investigate. Then we started hearing rumblings that something was going on in Moscow, and the agents sent to have a discussion with the scientist Mr. Rule identified encountered him being kidnapped.” “They did?” I stated in surprise, and started to worry as I thought about the timeline where the Chinese had sent assassins after Davey’s family, and mine. That made me really worry. “If they went after him, our families…” “Are under observation and are fine for the present.” Lerner stated. “A massive manhunt is underway at this time. The KGB was forced to use agents from their San Francisco mission, and were easily identified. They are hiding somewhere in the Napa Valley, but we’ll find them and retrieve the scientist. Mr. Rule states that his loyalty to the United States is questionable at best.” “I wouldn’t know for sure, but from what I’ve been told in other timelines, I’d tend to agree with that opinion.” I answered the unspoken question. Lerner noted as he checked something off on his notepad. “How do we counter the moves this Shevardnadze will make?” Hoskins asked after the room had been silent for several moments. “Kill him.” I answered emphatically without hesitation. All four men looked shock at the answer. “In the last timeline, Davey arranged a subterfuge. He convinced President Reagan and his own father that he was a time traveler, and then he convinced them that his young brain couldn’t completely hold the ‘advanced’ knowledge and that he would soon lose it forever. They acted on the information and managed to assassinate all the enemy time travelers before they came back in time, effectively ending their ability to go back into that timeline.” “Doesn’t that create a paradox or something?” Eldridge asked with a pained expression. “The way it was explained to me by another Sean still gives me a headache.” I said honestly and with a bit of sympathy. “Supposedly only one timeline can exist at any given moment, but all the instances of time travel coexist simultaneously, so if a time traveler from 2004 goes back to 1976, he creates a new timeline by any changes he makes, but a time traveler from a previous 2004 still exists and will still arrive in 1981. With enough time travelers, and time lines, it gets very confusing. Sean created this chart that showed all the time travelers and their originating time lines one time. I could recreate it for you, but it doesn’t really help. Why it doesn’t create a paradox I don’t know, but the jamming device we developed in my originating timeline was supposed to stop all other time travel, effectively erasing their ability to affect this timeline. Obviously it failed.” “Yes, it did.” Wolfowitz gloated, but settled down after the other men in the room gave him reproachful looks. “In every time line that Shevardnadze has been allowed to impact, a war has happened that caused huge losses of American life.” I pointed out. “Killing him might prevent that from happening now.” “He has already begun changes in the Soviet Union.” Wolfowitz argued. “Killing him now won’t do any good. We need to stop him from ever coming back. The Rule kid states that he might be able to recreate a time machine and a jamming device.” “That will work.” I agreed instantly. “I could help him with the jamming device.” “Even if it means you won’t be able to come back in time again?” Wolfowitz asked with a gloating expression and I paused for a long moment before meeting his eyes directly. “I’d rather… I’d rather a time line where I did not go back than a timeline altered by Shevardnadze.” I said in a firm voice, but I spoke slowly as if the words pained me greatly. “You know, I almost believe that.” Wolfowitz said after looking at me for another long minute. “Why?” “I’m not selfish enough to put my happiness over the lives of thousands, or millions.” I said with a shrug. “But what about the changes you think need to be made?” Lerner asked. “One thing about history is that it shows us there will always be conflict.” I said with a shrug. “The–the things that happen do cost lives, sometimes even thousands of lives, but none of them are as bad as a possible all-out nuclear war, or a direct war between the Soviet Union and the United States.” “Why is that?” Hoskins asked as he leaned forward slightly with obvious interest. “It’s difficult to believe, but the world really does change tremendously after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” I started carefully. “Twenty years from now, an entire generation will have grown to adulthood who do not remember what it was like for two juggernauts like the United States and USSR to stand opposite each other, both capable of wiping out all life on Earth with one decision. Sure, there are still threats. A city might be nuked, or airplanes might be hijacked and slammed into towers, but a war that ends all life on Earth is a science fiction story usually involving aliens instead of a very real possibility. Kids learn about the Cold War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis and other events and they don’t really understand that all life on Earth really could have ended in the blink of an eye while the Soviet Union and the United States faced off against each other. “Likewise, those of us who lived during the Cold War have a hard time adjusting to a world where the biggest threat to our country is that we might lose a skyscraper, or at worst a single city.” I continued. “We remember the perspective of losing our entire planet, and we subconsciously escalate the threat we face then with the threat we face now. So we react out of proportion to the real threat at hand.” “You say that in the future terrorists manage to strike our cities with nukes?” Wolfowitz asked with a shocked look. “In part because we badly handled the breakup of the Soviet Union, yes.” I confirmed. “Which you are trying to change.” Lerner added. “Yes.” I agreed. “I know on the surface it looks like what I was doing seems solely selfish, and I won’t deny there is a selfish aspect to it, but in the long run it was to be for the betterment of our country, and by extension our world.” “I see.” Lerner nodded. “Thank you for your candor, Mr. Breckenridge. We’ll take a short break for now, and begin again in about an hour, over lunch.” “Thank you for listening.” I said politely as they left the room. A soldier poked his head into the room and I followed him out, back to the room I’d slept in with the others. Sean was there already, as was Davey, although the rest of our friends were gone. “Where’s everyone?” I asked. “Getting a tour.” Davey said with a frown. “I wasn’t invited.” “Why not?” I asked. “For some reason they think I know more than I’m telling.” Davey said with a groan. “They seem to think I’m responsible for all this time travel mess, but it was that other me, wasn’t it?” “You’re right.” I assured him. “It’s not fair.” “Nothing in life is fair.” Sean muttered with a shake of his head. “So, Brian, did they bring up the idea of rebuilding a time machine and another jammer?” “Yes.” I said and Davey let out a groan. “They asked me about it too, like I knew anything!” He moaned. “Still, I told them it was probably for the best, to solve this situation, but that maybe someone should go back just to make sure there wasn’t another time travel device, like you’d planned.” “Which is how I’m here, and we’re all here in the Pentagon instead of in the hospital room.” Sean muttered. “What hospital room?” I asked in alarm and Sean frowned. “I didn’t want to tell the others, but on that night, on the way home from the game, there was an accident.” Sean said sadly. “Todd got hit by a drunk driver while they were walking back, and spent six days in a coma before he died. It was weird seeing him after all these years, but that’s at least one good change, although if we do this plan of building another machine, I don’t know what good it will be in the long run.” “Gentlemen.” A voice called from the doorway and we looked up to see an Army Colonel standing there. “Would you please come with me?” We followed the man through the bowels of the Pentagon and up into the actual halls of the regular portions of the building. Our friends were waiting outside a set of doors that I recognized as leading to the Secretary of Defense’s office, all of them looking a little worried. We waited there, not saying a word until the doors opened and we were escorted inside to find a room mostly empty except for a few Secret Service agents, and the President. “I thought I’d come over here and take a look at you myself.” Ronald Reagan said in a slightly cheerful tone as I stepped forward a pace from my friends and moved to shake his hand. “Mr. President, it’s an honor to meet you.” I said. “My name is Brian Breckenridge. These are my friends.” He shook hands as I introduced each of my friends, and then invited us to sit down in chairs that had been arranged in a circle. He took one of the chairs, and I ended up sitting on his left hand. Sean sat on the other side of him. “I find all this hard to believe, but my people assure me it is genuine.” He said after a moment of silence while we all got settled. “One thing that is bothering me: Why would supposedly smart young men like you be working on the Dukakis campaign?” “He’s a loser, Mr. President.” I said with a chuckle as Davey laughed and gave me a knowing look. “There’s no way he was going to win this campaign, but working on it gave us the start of certain connections that will be needed later on. I hate to tell you this, but Republicans don’t hold on to the oval office forever, and well, the Democrats need a lot more help than the Vice-President.” “They always are in need of help, Mr. Breckenridge.” The President laughed before turning serious. “There appears to be open fighting going on in the Kremlin, and we’re not sure which side is going to come out on top. My advisors tell me that the two of you can make another one of these infernal machines, and put an end to this time travel business once and for all.” “Yes, Mr. President.” Sean said in a slightly awed voice. “I believe the problem was that a frequency was left open for Brian’s transport back. With his help, we can isolate all remaining frequencies and jam those too.” “Are you willing to do this, young man?” He asked me with a very direct gaze. “I understand you have some issues.” “I do, but they pale besides the comparison of a war between the USSR and the USA.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. Davey let out a small whimper that drew his attention. “Do you have a problem with this, Mr. Jones?” The President asked him. “It’s just… my life is better than it would have been without his changes.” Davey said slowly but he shook his head. “Still, put up against a possible war with the Soviet’s, it’d be better for my life to go the way it was than for people to die in a big war.” “I can sympathize with that feeling young man.” The President said with a kindly smile. “I asked myself, just to get an idea of what I was going to be asking you young men to give up, how I would feel if such actions meant I would never be President. In the end, I decided that it would be a price I was willing to pay in order to stop a World War.” “We don’t know a World War is going to happen.” Todd argued and then he blushed when the President turned his attention to him. “What do our two time travelers believe?” President Reagan asked. “There will be a war.” I said at once and Sean nodded his agreement. “If you’re sure about it.” Todd said at last with a sigh. “Now, how long will it take to rebuild this time machine, and what resources will you need?” The President asked us directly and I looked over at Sean, who would be the one doing most of the work. I didn’t know half of what was needed, no, not even a quarter! In the end it took five years to build the machine, and the world was a nightmare. Shevardnadze’s hard-line faction won the shoot-out in the Kremlin, and the Soviet Union was ruled with an iron fist. Protests at the ending of Glasnost and similar Gorbachev programs were brutally crushed, and Hungary never voted out the communists. In 1989, the Berlin Wall never fell, and we came damn close to losing West Berlin itself. The scientist who had invented the time machine was never found, until a CIA agent caught wind of him in Moscow during the final days of 1989. Our agents couldn’t get anywhere near Shevardnadze, but they managed to poison the scientist before he could build another machine for the Soviets. The expected response, a KGB attack on Sean and his family only succeeded in killing Sean’s father. Sean shrugged it off as ‘no big deal’. There was an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, but this time it was backed by the full might of the Soviet Union. Thanks to information we had given our government, and the focused efforts of our intelligence agencies, the Iraqis and Soviets had a little surprise as Iraqi troops barely paused to consolidate Kuwait before pushing into Saudi Arabia. An entire carrier battle group surged into the Gulf, and its planes began bombing the Iraqi troops as soon as they were outside the city of Kuwait. American fighters surged from Germany (after being refueled by planes staged in Israel and Saudi Arabia) engaged Iraq’s air force, slaughtering them in a great air-to-air battle that lasted for twelve hours. It took nearly two weeks for two Marine Amphibious groups to arrive, and by then most of Iraq’s armor in the area had been crushed. The US Marines landed in Kuwait with enough force, and complete air coverage, and the remaining Iraqi troops fled Kuwait like rats from a sinking ship. The Soviet Union, with a bloody nose, pulled back for a little while, licking its wounds while the KGB fomented problems for us in South America. In 1992, George H. W. Bush easily won reelection in a Cold War that wasn’t quite so cold anymore. By the end of 1993, we were conducting our first tests with the new machine. The truth was that Sean was right about me. When it came to the theory behind time travel and its operations, or actually putting it together, I couldn’t help much. However, when it came to operating the machine, or the new ‘jamming’ device, figuring which frequencies, and similar things, I ended up being a lot of help. Poor Davey, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd were stuck being with us, acting as moral support most of the time, although each of them helped in their own way. Todd and Brandon helped with different aspects of the computer components or software, working with the experts the government had assigned us as if they had already completed a full college education in their specific fields. Since they spent the first two years of the project going to classes at Georgetown, that was pretty much the case. Trevor helped in other ways, by helping relieve tension when it built up too high, or asking really basic questions when we were stuck, forcing us to think again in much simpler terms. (He called them stupid questions, but they were far from stupid and helped us solve several problems.) Together, all of us made an impressive team, and when the machine was ready for testing, the military took precautions, but did not deny us all a place in the chamber where the machine was waiting. “You understand, no time travelers.” Roger Sazar, the President’s point man on this project said while we waited for the airlock to cycle. We were actually located in a remote facility in the backwoods of Virginia. This was the bunker built for members of Congress in case of nuclear attack, and had everything needed for our experiments. We had a good, strong, dependable power supply, plenty of food and water, and most importantly in the eyes of the government, hundreds of soldiers to make sure no one went back in time. Our mission was simple, power up the machine, activate the jammer that would keep me, and the others, from going back in time, and then wait to make sure the outside world survived. We had plenty of antennas and other equipment that would allow us to monitor the outside world for a long time before we shut down the bubble and ended our own existence. “We understand.” I repeated for my friends one last time as the huge airlock door, nearly five feet of reinforced steel and concrete swung open. Sean and I led the way in, barely looking at the MRI-type machine surrounded by twenty armed soldiers. Davey and the rest followed us into the control room where a bank of control machines waited for us, and a thick glass window allowed us to monitor events in the machine room. There were more soldiers standing guard in here, and two Generals who nodded at us as we entered. “General Crowley, are we ready to begin?” I asked. As head of the scientific team, I was to have the honor of actually giving the orders, but he was here to countermand anything I might do to stop events. Sure, I’d said I was willing to suffer the consequences, but the government was making sure. “You may proceed.” He said as the airlock door closed with a thud. The room was sealed, and my ears popped as it pressurized to prevent any form of attack from outside. We knew the Soviets had gotten wind of our program, and my knowledge of the timeline where they used nukes in an attempt to stop Davey from going back again warned us that if they knew we were acting today, there would be nuclear war. “Power her up.” I said with a nod to Davey. All of my friends had roles to play today, at the controls of the machine. Sure, we admitted it could be operated with fewer people, but the more hands on deck today, the more likely we could succeed. “Um, General, you might want those soldiers to stand further away from the machine.” Sean said with a bit of muffled laughter. “Why is that, son?” The General asked with a frown. “The machine is a Magnetic Resonance Imager, General.” Trevor reminded him. “It creates a very high-power magnetic field that will…oops, too late.” There was a great clatter, and muffled curses coming from the machine room as soldiers lost bits of metal, and their weapons to the magnetic field of the machine. The equipment flew across the room and attached itself to the machine, and the soldiers cursed as they tried to retrieve their gear. “Damn it!” The General cursed as he turned to the other soldiers in the room. “Go help them. No! Leave your gear here! Can you shut the machine down?” “Begin reducing power to the machine, gradually.” I ordered and Sean began moving a lever on the controls as the remaining soldiers in our control room dropped their weapons, and every bit of metal on their body before heading into the other room to help their comrades. It was a shame really, they were just following orders but it was necessary. “What’s happening?” General Crowley asked as the door between the control room and the machine room closed. “We’ve got a breach in the coolant system!” Todd’s voice sounded alarmed and the two Generals and Sazar, the only men in the room besides my friends, rushed to the control panel and looked out the window to where the soldiers were now choking as some gas spewed from the machine. “Get them out of there!” Sazar shouted, looking around the control panel frantically. “Sorry.” Brandon murmured as he, Davey, and Trevor turned around with small stun guns in their hands. All three men received several shocks before they passed out. Then they were tied up, gagged, and sedated with some drugs from a military first aid kit that would guarantee they would not wake up for a while. Outside the last of the soldiers had succumbed to the gas. “I feel…dirty.” Todd murmured as we looked out at the collapsed soldiers. “None of them should be dead.” Davey murmured softly. “C’mon, we’ve got to clean up in there.” Everyone except Sean and I left the control room after the gas was vented from the other room, and the door opened. The machine was powered down just long enough to remove all the weapons and gear attracted to it, and the collapsed soldiers from locations near the machine. Then it was powered up again to full power. “How much power do we have?” I asked Sean who smiled happily. “More than enough.” He answered. “Let’s get this show on the road then.” I replied and went out to the main room, where Davey kissed me before helping me onto the machine’s platform. He handled the needle himself, and kissed me one last time before my eyes closed and I prepared for another trip back in time. Chapter 21 I opened my eyes and smiled at the sight of my old bedroom. Sunlight was just peaking in through the drapes, and I could clearly make out the football and wrestling posters on the walls, the comforter Mom had changed out when I’d reached fourteen, and the older, smaller dresser I’d had until I entered high school. Yep, I’d come back for a third childhood, and the preliminary evidence showed we’d hit it around the right timeframe. I got out of bed slowly, knowing from the last experience it would take a moment to get accustomed to the younger body. Certainly it felt weird being several inches shorter, and about forty pounds lighter, without quite as much muscle buildup as I had in my early twenties. My morning woody was a little different as well, a little smaller, and a lot more sensitive than I remembered it being even at twenty. After turning on the room light, I got a good glance at the calendar and smiled at the pile of books on my desk while the brand new backpack sat on the chair, waiting to be loaded. Yep, it was the first day of seventh grade, and I’d stayed up late last night getting ready, but not loading my backpack until the morning. “Brian!” Mom’s voice was accompanied by a knock. “You better get a move on or you’re going to be late for your first day!” “I’m up mom!” I shouted back, surprised at how my voice cracked right in the middle of that. Oh yeah, I wasn’t out of puberty yet. I’d been spared that particular curse, for the most part, the last time I’d gone back, but as I began to wake up a little more, I could feel how… unbalanced things felt inside of me. This was going to be weird. “What do you want for breakfast?” She yelled back, and I opened the door, forgetting I was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers and that the front of them was tented a bit. She gave me a look that almost made me blush. “Sorry, pancakes would be nice.” I said with a slight smile and she nodded before moving towards the kitchen while shaking her head. For my part, I grabbed a towel from the hall closet and went to take a shower. It was nice being home, and I felt so relaxed as I cleaned up, and took care of the morning business while wondering what Davey was going to look like at this age. Sure, I could call up a memory, but that had been a different Davey. I was going to get to see the original twelve-year old Davey. “Are you excited, honey?” Mom asked me twenty minutes later after I’d dressed in a new pair of jeans, a nice blue button-down shirt with a sleeveless checkered sweater over it, and my loaded backpack was sitting on the floor next to me as I ate breakfast. “You wouldn’t believe how excited I am.” I told her as Dad came into the room, dressed for work. “Morning Dad!” “Morning Brian.” Dad said with a slight smile. “Oh, I don’t know, I can remember the first time I went to Junior High.” Mom said with a wide smile. “Just don’t forget to say hello to your aunt.” “I won’t.” I groaned playfully and she laughed softly. Fifteen minutes later we were walking outside, towards her car, and I remembered why I’d almost been late on the first day of school. “The tires flat!” Mom groaned as she noticed the driver’s side tire. “You’re going to be late for school!” “If you don’t mind getting Dad to change it for you, I can jog and make it to school on time.” I offered and she frowned. “I don’t want you showing up to your first class all sweaty.” She stated. “Don’t worry mom, get dad to fix the tire and I’ll get to school.” I said as I leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek. I still had to stand on my tiptoes to do that. “Okay, but you be careful!” She yelled. It wasn’t that bad of a jog to school, and I passed the familiar faces of Ronna and Jeanette on the way. They looked young, and were happily talking away to each other, but Davey was nowhere in sight with them as he’d been before. How many times had he told me the story about me bumping into him that first time he came back in time? It was a little disappointing to me that he wasn’t there now, but the sight waiting for me at the end of the bike path more than made up for that lack. “Heya, Bri.” Trevor said with a smile as I came to a stop next to him. “Yo Bri, glad you could make it.” Brandon added with a smile, and then turned back to tickle Sean who was too busy giggling to do more than wave. Todd was laughing at their antics from where he stood next to Trevor. His red hair was longer than I remembered, and he looked like a stoner, but otherwise was very much the Todd I remembered. Davey was standing there, on the opposite side of the circle of friends from me, giving me a very welcome smile. It was so hard not to take him in my arms and kiss him right here and now. He was only slightly overweight, and there was a nice-sized pimple on his right cheek, but he was my Davey, and the best part was the Davey looking out at me through those eyes. It wasn’t the twelve-year old, but the slightly older, slightly more mature Davey from the last timeline. The one who’d managed to make it through the challenges of rough teenage years and become a good man. “Looks like we all made it this time.” Davey said softly. “Yup, just like Brian planned.” Todd added. “You come up with good plans, Bri.” Trevor added with a sigh. “So what happens now? We never got enough time where they weren’t listening to go into too many details about what happens when we all get back.” “We’ll discuss it after school, okay?” I offered. “You mean after flag-football practice.” Brandon pointed out. “Well, what are Sean and I going to do while you boys get all hot and sweaty?” Todd asked. “What about me?” Davey pointed out. “I’m not on the team.” “Like hell you’re not.” Trevor snorted. “You’re signing up today.” Brandon said as he got Sean into a headlock and proceeded to give him a noogie. “As for these two, we could use some pretty cheerleaders.” “I’d watch that if I were you.” Sean growled as he slipped out of the headlock and managed to kick the back of Brandon’s knees, sending him to the ground. We all laughed as Brandon looked up in surprise at his boyfriend. “I learned wrestling in the last timeline, remember?” “Yeah, I remember.” Brandon laughed. “Just checking to see if your runt of a body could still get out of it.” “Runt of a body, you really don’t want any do you?” Sean teased him. “Um, about that.” Brandon said and he looked over at me. “Aren’t we like twelve now?”",

      "content": "“We’re all twelve now, right?” I asked and got nods all around. “Should we be having sex?” Brandon asked. “Well, it’s not like we weren’t playing around at this age anyway.” Trevor said, but then he gave me a look. “Well, most of us were anyway.” “Aren’t we all like virgins again?” Todd asked. “I know I am.” “So am I, physically.” Sean said, but he was grinning at Brandon. “For right now, at least.” “So am I, but I don’t see why we shouldn’t have fun.” I said with a shrug. “I mean, we’re all pretty established in our relationships, right?” “Yeah, that’s for sure.” Davey said with a smile. “Just remember, coming out right now isn’t going to be fun or easy.” Sean reminded all of us. “My parents, and Davey’s at least will have conniption fits and we’re too young to get emancipated yet.” “I hate being young again.” Davey moaned. “You lose so many privileges that being an adult gets you.” “It takes some adjustment.” I agreed. “Some of us have it easier than others, and we should make sure our families get used to us spending a lot of time together. For now, my place, or Trevor’s will be the best place to get together as a group.” “Oh yeah, a lot of trips to the barn.” Brandon said with a leer at Sean. “You really are cute at this age, you know. Then again you’re cute at any age.” “You’re just saying that because your twelve-year old hormones are talking.” Sean teased back, but he was smiling as the bell rang. “Ah, crap, we got class.” Trevor groaned, and we all headed into the school as a group. A few of our ‘friends’ from this time gave us odd looks because Todd, Sean and Davey weren’t normally part of our group, but they’d get used to that in time. Time. We had so much time to plan now, and while it was true I hadn’t been able to do more than lay out the basic elements of how to secure access to the time machine and get us all back here, but I had spent plenty of time over the last years in that other timeline planning on what to do when we got here. First off was to get reestablished in our younger bodies, and our younger lives. There were other things to take care of, but that would take a little bit longer. I intended to make sure that no other time machine could be built, and to do that someone would have to die. The easiest would be the scientist. While my friends had by and large balked at the idea of killing the soldiers and others that would be in the chamber with us, I had been able to adapt those plans to non-lethal means. Sean and Davey, though, had shown no squeamishness at killing, and they would be the ones to help me with the plans for the scientist that had started this whole chain of events. We had years, though, before we needed to take those steps. For now, the most important thing was to just enjoy the fact that instead of being a lonely time traveler, we were all in our younger bodies, and we all remembered our friendships and relationships with each other. There would be no dancing around, trying to reestablish what had been begun in a previous timeline. I just did my best to not think about certain things that couldn’t be changed. Uncle Rich already had AIDS, and he’d die around Christmastime this year. Going back earlier might have changed that, but the fact was we knew that at this age our bodies were able to handle the adult memories of past lives. Going back further endangered that, as Davey learned in my original timeline. Saving Uncle Rich just wasn’t worth that risk. First period English was fun, but jock math was absolute hell for me. By whispered agreement, those of us in that class (Trevor, Davey, and I) agreed we’d get out of it after the first week and into a more advanced math. Davey joined Brandon, Trevor and me for lunch, while Sean and Todd visited with some of their old friends. While we were all good friends as young adults, the truth was that we moved in different circles during Junior and Senior High, and while we were going to be making many changes, they didn’t all need to start on the first day. After practice we all met in a nearby park, sitting together at one of the wooden benches that dotted the area. We had the area pretty much to ourselves, and wouldn’t have to worry about a parent coming in and hearing us talk about things they wouldn’t be prepared to understand. It was pretty obvious the younger hormones were kicking in, because there was a lot of physical contact between the various couples as we sat down to talk. “Ugh, this is going to drive me insane.” Trevor groaned as Todd sat next to him. “You’ve got a barn, invite me to dinner.” Todd teased him and Trevor growled. “You’re coming to dinner.” “Geez, twist my arm, why don’t ya?” Todd laughed. “Where are we going?” Sean asked Brandon. “There’s some bushes over there.” Brandon said with a jerk of his head. “We have those reserved.” Davey added. “Business first?” I asked, hating to break up the horny banter. I knew only part of it was from actual horniness. Most came from the fact that we’d succeeded in fooling several powerful people over several very tense years. “Yeah, okay, how do we prevent World War III?” Davey asked in a mock-serious tone. “We kill the bad Russian.” Trevor offered. “Better yet, we kill the scientist.” Todd offered. “Um, didn’t you guys hesitate at…” I started to suggest but Brandon shook his head. “That was different.” Brandon said. “Those guys were innocent.” “Yeah.” Trevor agreed. “Yup.” Todd added. “Well, we’ve got years before that is necessary.” I pointed out. “In fact, we should probably wait until we’re at least sixteen or seventeen and don’t have to depend on others for transportation.” “But you have an idea about how to do it, right?” Davey asked. “I’m thinking either a car accident, or poison.” I admitted. “I’d lean towards car accident but we have to make sure it’s fatal. We’ll spend a few months observing him and his movements, and work out a more exact plan once we’re older. They don’t come back until 1988, remember?” “That’s right, so there’ll be in plenty of time.” Sean smiled. “Okay, so what about between now and then?” Trevor asked. “Do we just lay low, be normal students or whatever, keep the fact that we’re fucking like bunnies a secret and just live life or do we do something?” “Sean, you said when you came back that my plans to help alleviate the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union didn’t work.” I stated. “Is it fair to say the problem was what I expected, that there wasn’t enough time between 1988 and 1991?” “That was what you decided before I came back.” Sean answered. “You said ground work would have to be made several years earlier in order to get a better impact.” “So, a question for all of us.” I said and was glad that the playfulness had died down. Everyone was as serious as could be right now. “Do we live our lives as normally as possible, not showing we already know what we’re learning in classes, or do we do something different?” “You’re not talking about admitting to the government we’re time travelers, are you?” Davey asked suspiciously. “Hell no.” I snorted. “That’s just asking for trouble, especially once they believe us. No. You know, we’re just an extraordinary group of geniuses who manage to learn very fast and learn at a very accelerated rate. If we play it right, we can be finishing up high school by the time we’re fifteen, and we can be in the right schools, at the right time to advance the right theories to the right people a few years earlier.” “But, our friends…” Todd started to protest and then he sighed. “Why do I see your faces being in my future for decades?” “We’ll make other friends along the way, but at least we’ll always have each other to fall back on.” Davey said with an appreciative look on his face. “I mean, think about what we’ve been through, what we’ve done. I know all of you will always be important to me for the rest of my life.” “Aw, how sweet.” Sean said in a mock-moan, but everyone had embarrassed smiles on their faces. “So how do we do this?” Trevor asked. “I mean, is there anyone who isn’t onboard with this idea?” “Nope.” Several of them said at once. Then everyone looked at me again. Even though Sean had come back in the last timeline, I was still the ‘oldest’ of them, and had all the knowledge of the original Davey Jones at my recall. “For now, we just ace every quiz, every test and we make it very obvious to our teachers that we’re extremely bored with their work.” I explained easily. “They should get the hint within a month, and if any of them don’t we’ll take other steps through my aunt. Their next step should be to give us new assessment tests, where we’ll do everything but the absolutely most difficult questions. I don’t think any of us except maybe Davey and Trevor will have problems with the math parts.” “Yeah, I might fail that part.” Davey said with a chortle. He’d always hated math. “That should give the teachers a conundrum to deal with, and we’ll probably be accused of cheating.” I continued with a laugh. “So, we’ll probably end up taking the tests again, and we should perform about the same. After a lot of head scratching, our parents will probably come talk to us about skipping a grade or two. Maybe even sending all of us to a special school. We should end up freshmen somewhere, and from there it’ll be a few years until we get our high school diplomas and move on to college.” “No sports then.” Trevor said with a frown. “Well, we might be able to figure something out there, although we’ll definitely be at a disadvantage with our lack of development.” I said with a shrug. “We can always do three-on-three.” Davey said, and then blushed as a few of the guys chuckled. “Sorry, not on our backs.” “Don’t get kinky, Jones.” Todd grumbled playfully. “What careers do we get this time?” Sean asked. “I mean, I like physics and all, but I’d really like to go into computers.” “I really want to focus on computers too.” Brandon added. “Some of the stuff that was coming out there before we left, it was pretty damn cool.” “I want to do the political stuff again.” Davey said with a smile and then he shrugged when everyone groaned. “Hey, I like it!” “I know.” Todd added. “I’m not sure what I want to do right now.” “Me neither.” Trevor added. “We don’t have to decide now.” I reminded them. “You’ve got a year or two. Remember, we’re going to know more than other kids our age, but that doesn’t necessarily make us geniuses. We’re still going to have to learn things, but we’ll have a head start. That’s the main thing to remember. When we get back into college, it’ll be slower going again.” “Got it.” Trevor murmured. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, Todd needs to see my barn and what it looked like in 1981.” “Have fun.” Davey leered at them and he grinned at me. “Want to walk me home, Brian? You might not know this, but your place is on the way to where I live now.” “Sure.” I agreed while Brandon and Sean got up, heading for some bushes without even a word to us. “I do love you.” Davey said softly as we began the walk home. “You know, I’ve got some changes to make with my father.” “Stopping him from molesting Jenny, yes.” I agreed. “If we leave too soon for some advanced school, I won’t be able to do that.” Davey said. “Any suggestions on how to go about this?” “Start with Jenny.” I offered and he nodded. “You mean talk to her about inappropriate touching and stuff, and how even if it was your parent you should tell someone, or better yet, scream as loud as you can to stop it from happening?” He threw out several ideas, all of them good. “I think we’re on the right track.” I replied as we kept walking and talking. When we got to my place, we walked up and in the front door together, and for a moment we both totally forgot that my parents had not met him yet. “You’re home late.” Mom said a little tightly. “And who is this?” “Oh, um, yeah, sorry mom.” I said with a wry grin. “This is my new best friend, Davey Jones. I thought you should meet him since you’re going to be seeing a lot of him from now on.” “Well, that was quite an introduction.” Mom said with an odd look on her face, but she smiled at Davey and shook his hand. “I think my son might have just fallen in love.” “It might be puppy love.” Davey said dead-pan. “I better watch it in case he decides to start humping my leg.” The look on mom’s face was priceless, and I couldn’t decide if she was going to not like Davey, or fall over laughing. She ended up laughing so hard there were tears in her eyes. “Oh my, your Uncle Rich is going to love hearing this.” Mom said to me as she began to get control over herself. “That’s your uncle in the City, right?” Davey said to me with a wink. “You’re going to have to take me to meet him sometime.” “How about this weekend?” I asked and looked at mom who was looking at us with surprise. “Do you think Uncle Rich might like some visitors?” “I’m sure he’d love to have you guys visit, but um, Brian, are you sure that…” Mom’s voice trailed off as she looked uncomfortably at Davey. “Don’t worry, ma’am, Brian’s already told me about his gay uncle, and no it doesn’t bother me at all.” Davey said with a smile. “My dad’s the hellfire and brimstone preacher, not me. I tend to take a more relaxed view of the world.” “I see.” She said with a twinkle in her eye. “Brian, where did you find this guy?” “On the way to school.” I answered. “Well, would you boys like a snack or something?” Mom asked as she recovered. “No thanks, ma’am.” Davey said with a smile. “I need to get home before Mom gets off work. She probably expects me to have done my chores instead of goofing off with this lug.” “Well, it was nice to meet you.” Mom said with a genuine smile. “I’ll have to meet your parents some day.” “I’m sure you will, ma’am.” Davey said with a twinkle in his eyes and I walked him to the door. She was still watching us, so we couldn’t kiss, but he did mouth ‘I love you’ before turning and walking away. “He’s quite a character.” Mom repeated when I shut the door. “I take it you had a good first day of school?” “You wouldn’t believe how good of a day.” I told her with a smile. The night was odd, I realized as I had nothing to do, really. The few chores I finished before dinner, and something in me wanted to be out, celebrating with my friends, and with Davey, but I knew that could not happen just yet. I spent several hours watching television with my parents, talking with them a little before heading into my room for bed. Twice while I thought about Davey I managed to jerk off, amazed at the sharpness, the almost overpowering level of sensations that rushed through my body. It really was different. “I don’t mind walking, mom.” I told my mother the next day as I waited for Davey. He showed up with his sister in tow. She really was a cute little girl, but she was giving Davey the oddest looks. It wasn’t until we left her at El Vista and headed on to our own school that I found out why. “When I got home last night, I found she’d gotten into my room, taken all my Star Wars action figures and had them in her room playing with her Barbie dolls.” Davey chuckled. “You should have seen her face. She was sitting there, fully prepared for me to launch into a tirade and for us to get in a fight.” “What did you do?” I asked with a smile. Oh yes, younger siblings could do such challenging things all the time. “I told her that when she was done, she’d better put them back where she found them.” Davey laughed. “Then, later, when Mom got home she whined that I was telling her what to do!” “What did your Mom say?” I asked. “She asked what I’d told Jenny to do, and Jenny told her that I was demanding she put away my toys.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “Mom turned to me and before she could say anything, I said ‘The toys she took out of my room and was playing with in her room.’ Mom turned right back around and told Jenny if she didn’t do what I told her, she would be grounded. I swear, if I’d known I’d get that sort of reaction, I’d have done that the first time around.” “It is nice having an older perspective.” I said. “Yeah, but there’s nice things about being younger again, too.” Davey said with a look I knew all too well. His voice dropped an octave. “I thought I was about to leap out of my body when I came last night thinking about you.” “Yeah, me too.” I admitted with a slight blush. “So, when are we going to sneak off somewhere?” He asked me. “Come over to my house after school.” I told him. “Mom’s going to be gone to her sister’s.” “Sounds good to me.” Davey said with a smile. “We can break your bed in again.” “I like that idea.” I said before we met up with our friends at the end of the bike path across from the school. We were fifteen minutes early, but everyone was there. “We need to talk some more about this whole idea.” Trevor said after we’d gotten the greetings out of the way. “I’m not sure if I want to go this route, and Brian, you’re always talking about how our biggest problems stem from us not fully thinking our way through things. We need to be careful about this.” “I agree.” I told him. “Good.” Todd added his agreement and everyone nodded their heads as well. That afternoon, in my house void of any parents, Davey and I managed to get our clothes off and explore our younger bodies. The equipment wasn’t full grown yet, but oh the feelings they generated! Both of us were far too noisy when we climaxed, and we lay there on the bed, together, panting and totally drained afterwards. “That was too good.” Davey said softly. “I’d forgotten what it was like. No wonder people get screwed up having sex too young. It’s just too intense for thought.” “Yep.” I agreed with him before slipping into a light doze. Fortunately Mom’s car in the driveway woke us both, and we got dressed in plenty of time before she made it inside. “Oh, hi Davey!” Mom said with a smile when we came out of the bedroom. “I didn’t know you were here.” “Brian and I were doing some homework.” Davey said with a theatrical sigh. “Those darn teachers! They’ve already got us doing homework!” “I’m sure you’ll survive.” She said with a little laugh. “Were you serious about going to the City this weekend?” He asked both her and me at the same time. “I did talk to Rich today, and he’s free if you boys wanted to visit.” Mom said with a look at me. “That sounds good.” I agreed. “My parents said I could go, but they want to meet you and Mr. B first.” Davey said to her. “Do you think your parents would like to come over for dinner on Thursday?” Mom asked. “As long as we bring my brat of a sister, they’ll probably be delighted.” Davey said and she laughed. “Oh, you have a sister?” She asked and he answered, talking about Jenny for a good five minutes. Poor Mom, Davey had her number already and she didn’t stand a chance against his manipulations. He’d have her eating out of his hand by the end of the week, and it was fun to watch. Oh yes, this was going to be the best timeline ever. Chapter 22 “I don’t know quite what to say, Brian.” Uncle Rich’s voice was weak, and he looked like death warmed over in his hospital bed. An I.V. line pumped liquids into him, but it was only a matter of time, hours, maybe a day or two if he was really lucky. He knew it as well as I did, sitting in this ward of the hospital in San Francisco. Outside it was Christmas, and people were celebrating the holiday with their families. I was too, in my own way, but it was a far different celebration. “I’m sorry, Uncle Rich.” I said softly, still holding his hand. His grip was weak, but he squeezed my hand as tightly as he could. “Don’t be, boy.” He said before a coughing fit took him. He punched the button on the morphine drip, and sighed as more of the drug flowed into his system. I knew he’d be asleep before long, and it would be wrong to keep Mom out of the room for much longer. Her, and her sister, and my father were all here, but I’d begged a few hours alone with him, and gotten them. “If we’d come back earlier, I might have warned you in time.” I said softly. “But we couldn’t quite arrange it perfectly.” “It’s almost too hard to believe, but you sound like you’re serious, so I’m going to believe you.” Rich said weakly, his voice relaxing as the drug eased his pain. “It certainly explains your sudden stroke of genius and them wanting to skip you ahead a few grades.” “It does, doesn’t it?” I said with a small smile. “Thank you, Uncle Rich. The last few months have been wonderful seeing you so much, you know.” “You’ve been a good nephew, and I like your friend, a lot.” Rich said with a chuckle. “Brenda doesn’t quite see it, but I was damn sure you two were a couple before you told me all this time travel stuff. Fated lovers. Got to love that. You be good to each other, you hear me? Stay faithful to each other too, with this damn disease. I wish you could do something about that.” “We’re trying.” I assured him. “We have to be subtle, but we’re pretty sure we found a way to get the right information to the right people without raising too many questions.” “That’s good.” He said before closing his eyes. His breathing was still shallow, but it was pain-free, and he was obviously asleep. I stood up, kissed his forehead and walked out of the room. “He’s asleep.” I said to Mom, who was standing outside with Aunt Linda and Dad. “Did you two say goodbye?” Mom asked and I nodded, letting the tears slide down my face. We really had said goodbye, and I’d had to ask forgiveness for not coming back further in time to save him. At least he’d given me that forgiveness. “Why don’t we go for a walk, son?” Dad said in a gentle voice as the two women went back into the room. I nodded, and we walked out of the hospital into the cool San Francisco morning. It would have been nice if Davey could have been here, but his parents had firmly put their foot down against his visiting over Christmas. There had been a big enough fight when they’d found out that Uncle Rich was sick, and with what. That had nearly shattered the budding friendship between our parents, but we were working on it. “How are you feeling, son?” Dad asked after we’d gone a few blocks. “Better.” I told him. “So much is changing.” Dad said sadly. “Your mother is going to be grieving for a while. You do understand that it isn’t likely…” “He’ll be gone in hours, or maybe a few days at most.” I said sadly. “I’ll miss him.” “I will too.” Dad said. “He’s a good man. It’s a shame he’s dying.” “It is.” I agreed. “How are you feeling about starting your new school?” Dad asked, changing the subject. “Are you sure you want this? You’ll be far away from home. I don’t know how your mother will deal with you being gone to a boarding school.” “I’ll be coming back every couple of months, and all summer.” I reminded him with a smile. He just shook his head. “I know, it’s not the same, but really, I can get a better education there, and I think that’s what I should do. It’s not like I’m going to be alone, either. That’s why we all decided to stop pretending on our school work, because we realized we weren’t alone, and we had friends.” “You do have an amazing group of friends.” Dad agreed. “Still, your mother and I are going to miss having you around.” “Do you think this… argument over Uncle Rich is going to scuttle the plans you’ve been making with Mr. Jones?” I asked him and Dad looked surprised. “No, oddly enough, I don’t think so.” Dad said. “We even talked about that before we drove up here. You were already in bed, but he called wanting to make sure that I wasn’t so pissed off I was going to pull out. It’s a good idea, a good business plan, and we’ve already gotten the loans approved to get started. He may be a little stuffy about social stuff, but he’s a good talker and will make a good face for the business while I handle all the financial issues.” “Plus Mrs. Jones is a pretty good organizer, isn’t she?” I asked, pleased at how Davey and I had pulled off the project of getting our parents into business together. The combination of all four of them working together would help a lot of things, especially with his sister. His father was going to be too busy, and too happy to fall into the emotional state that had led to him molesting his daughter. “She is, she is.” Dad agreed. “The more I get to know them, the more amazed I am by them as a family. Sandy’s father is a blast.” “Dad, stop trying to use cool words.” I told my father and he laughed. By the time we had returned to the hospital, Mom and Aunt Linda were ready for dinner. After a good meal, everyone returned to Uncle Rich’s room, and it was time. I could feel it in the room, and part of me fell apart as his two sisters each held one of Uncle Rich’s hands. He’d been awake, but not really coherent when we came back from dinner. He’d quieted down and smiled though when they held his hands, and so they stood like that for several hours, none of us moving at all until his eyes closed for the last time, and his lungs exhaled for the very last time. While Dad held Mom, I held Aunt Linda who was crying just as hard as my mother. We cleared the room while nurses and a doctor filed in to do all the official things they have to do, and we tried to comfort the two women. My own eyes were filled with tears, and I had to struggle to remember the forgiveness I’d been given for not stopping this. It really was a sad Christmas, but at least there was some more healing to be done after we returned home to Modesto. We’d pulled in and I was still unloading the car when a familiar brown Buick pulled up in front of our house. Mr. Jones was dressed in one of his best suits, and Mrs. Jones was wearing what looked like a new dress as they got out of the car. Even Davey was wearing a suit, and Jenny had on a very pretty dress as well as they walked up the driveway towards me. “Davey told us of your loss, Brian.” David Jones, Sr. said in a quiet, deep voice. “How are you holding up?” “I’m well, sir.” I said quietly, returning his politeness with politeness of my own. “It went as well as one could hope. Uncle Rich was surrounded by his family up until the very end.” “As it should be.” He said with a slight bow of his head. “Do you think your parents would be up for visitors?” “I think they’ll be happy to see you.” I offered and he smiled slightly as Davey took the suitcase I was holding and I led his family up to my house. Mom and Dad were talking quietly in the dining room when we walked in, and at first they looked wary, but that quickly changed to grateful appreciation for their visitors. “You have no idea how much preaching I had to do.” Davey whispered to me as we stood out on the back porch while the adults were still inside, talking over coffee (and tea for Sandy). Jenny was in the living room watching television. “I took his own damn bible and started pulling out every bible verse I could find about love and forgiveness. Considering we were at Nanny’s, and all the family was there, it turned into a free-for-all bible study session. When Papa came in on my side, I knew I’d won. “I knew you could do it.” I congratulated him softly and he blushed slightly. Making sure our parents stayed on good terms was important to both of us for a variety of reasons. My last time around, I’d taken the approach that I had plenty of years to make changes, but Sean had disabused me of that notion with our failure to stop the mad scientist and the power-hungry communist. Instead of just enjoying our collective new teenage years, we were going to take steps. Besides, as Trevor remarked, it got kind of old after a month. Even I’d forgotten the big differences between being twelve and being seventeen. We all had bed times that were far too early, our parents watched us a lot, a lot more than we were used to having to deal with, and of course none of us could legally drive. What had been a short car drive over to someone’s house turned into twenty or thirty minutes of bike riding, jogging, or begging for a ride from a parent. Sure, the school we were going to had a lot more restrictions in some ways, but in other ways it also had a lot more freedoms for us, and it would accelerate us on the path of making some changes. It was shortly after the New Year, 1982, when we all flew up to our new school with our parents. The school was a very private, very exclusive Military Preparatory Academy in the backwoods of upstate New York. I know most kids get threatened with being sent off to a military school if they are bad, but in this case there couldn’t have been a better fit for all of us. I had heard of the school in my original timeline because I’d worked with one person who had gone there. The man was a career diplomat in the State Department and one of the best at what he did. He had given full credit to the General John Cleveland Robinson Academy for giving him many of the skills he used in his work. As a private school, it accepted only students that it had invited to attend, and I was surprised when we received invitations in late November. Almost never did any school of this type offer mid-term admissions, and for all six of us to receive invitations was an opportunity I hoped we, as a group, would not pass up. After looking at their academic offerings, most of us were onboard with going there (especially since there were scholarships involved so that all of us could afford to attend), but the deciding factor for Trevor was the fact that they did have a football team. The school was your typical private boarding school, located on fairly large grounds that were well maintained, circled by a wall, and had uniformed guards at the front gate. There were four main large, multi-story buildings, and several smaller buildings as well as what looked like a fairly impressive sports complex all visible through the trees as we drove up the main drive. At the main building, an older man dressed in the uniform of an Army Colonel met us, and pleasantly greeted our parents before greeting the six of us who would be attending the school. “I am Colonel Barry Reynolds, the Deputy Superintendent of the Academy, and Professor of Military History.” He said by way of his own introduction. For the next hour, he personally led us on a tour of the facility, mostly directed at our parents. Then after introducing another man who was also an instructor there, we were separated from our parents and the real introductions began. “Each of you should be honored that we are accepting you as students here.” He told us in a stern voice. “You will be the youngest students in our school at this time, and you will have a lot of catching up to do from the beginning. That is why you are here a week before the term begins. We will cut you no slack once the term begins. For the next week you will be drilled in all the things you would have learned since last August regarding how this school operates. Four upper classmen have graciously volunteered to cut their leave period short in order to help prepare you for the new term. You will show them your appreciation by following all their directions to the utmost of your abilities.” He went on like that for several minutes, with all the typical things one might expect about the history and honor of the school. Then he introduced us to the upper classmen, who seemed a little taken aback that three of us were as tall as they were, even though we were five years younger. After a short period of their attempting to establish their dominance with typical bluster, our parents were returned for a lunch served in the dining hall of the school. That was where we were introduced to General Robert Lingstrom, the Superintendent of the school. He was a retired three-star Army General, who listed as part of his resume having worked for ten years at the National Security Agency. That was what had made us go from merely liking the idea of this school to doing my best to make sure everyone signed on with going here. After lunch, our parents gave us all a teary-eyed farewell; at least they were teary eyed while we all sighed with relief to see the rental cars leave. Then the upper classmen descended on us and gave us their version of a military boot camp. I wasn’t sure which disturbed them more, the ease with which all of us handled the push-ups and sit-ups they kept on requiring, the fact that all of us had already perfectly memorized the “General Orders” that all cadets were expected to know, or the fact that later that night none of us were homesick or crying, wanting to go back home. Todd and Sean were the two of us least accepting of the military mindset. I had been in the military myself, albeit as a reserve JAG officer, and Davey took to it like a fish to water. Trevor and Brandon accepted it with mild enjoyment, and although they didn’t really like all of it, Sean and Todd both tolerated it overall. The only thing they really complained about was the haircuts. They did not like having their hair shorn off, but even that they tolerated although I heard quite a few grumbles from them. The only real mistake the school had made was in the room assignments. All cadets lived in a two-person room. Each cadet had his own bunk, locker, wardrobe, and desk. Normally the school assigned cadets to the room, but during the first semester several cadets had ‘dropped out’ of the school, and the cadets left without a roommate had been moved, so there were more than three rooms available. No one had made room assignments for us, and that first day we were led to three available rooms, ordered to select our rooms and stow away our gear. That was a BIG mistake, but one we were extremely happy about because we were three couples and had been worried about how to get the right people to be rooming together. Since they had warned us that whoever we roomed with would be our roommates all through the rest of school, unless one of us dropped out, we were all extremely happy to make sure we roomed with our partner. At least now we would not have to be sneaking between rooms every night. “I don’t know if I can do this, Brian.” Davey moaned halfway through the first week. We were re-folding all of our clothes, mostly uniforms the school had provided. Like the real military, they expected everything folded in a very precise manner, just like our ‘bunks’ had to be made with tight corners precisely at a forty-five degree angle. “Do what?” I asked him. “Make my bed every damn morning, and fold my clothes like this.” Davey sighed. “What about all the other stuff?” I asked him and he laughed. “That shit is easy.” Davey said while laughing. “This is the hard shit.” For a week, the upper classmen tried to run us through what they thought would be hell. They got us up at three in the morning, and kept us going until late at night. There was a lot of physical exercise, but also a lot of mental drills as well. Marching was a big part of every day since it was a big part of the school’s daily routine, and we were drilled constantly on things like every little fact about the school’s namesake, Civil War Union General John Cleveland Robinson. Sunday was a little different for four of us since we were not used to dealing with ‘chapel’ or church services, but it was a requirement that all cadets attend. Davey and Sean snickered at the rest of us over that little aspect. Soon enough the term started, and the real schoolwork began. It took a few weeks for our fellow first-year cadets to warm up to us. At first they were standoffish with us new guys, but the first inter-house game competition in February broke the ice. We beat the sophomore team at nearly every event, and a large part of that was thanks to the athleticism of Trevor, Brandon, Davey and myself. The actual schoolwork was a mixture of easy and difficult subjects. We had no problems in the regular History, English, Math, or various Foreign Language subjects, but the Military History and other military-centered classes proved challenging. By the time Spring Break rolled around, everyone had expressed that they were generally happier at the school than they had been back home in Modesto. Still, it was good for all of us to go home over Spring Break and spend time with our families. For a week, we barely saw each other as we spent time with our individual families, but near the end of the week, it was our families who brought all of us together for a barbecue at a local park. There were about fifty of us altogether, as various grandparents, including my own grandparents who were still alive in this time line, all gathered along with our immediate families. When we returned from a very relaxing, and fun, Spring Break, each of us was called into the Superintendent’s office for one-on-one meetings. Overall, the General was pleased with how we were fitting into the school, but apparently some of the instructors were concerned that portions of our school work were ‘too easy’ for us. He did not like the idea that we were not being ‘challenged’ to develop to our full potential, and wanted to have us be given in-depth assessments by his faculty. That suited all of us just fine, because while some of our courses were challenging, we all knew that most of it was far too easy, and none of us liked the idea of not learning as much as we could. I think part of that was because of the last few years of the last timeline, where we’d raced against the clock to end a situation that threatened the stability of the world in which we lived. We all felt some personal level of responsibility to keep something like that from happening again, and mentally at least, we were all adults. Sure, we still had fun like any other teenagers, and a great deal of sex in the privacy of our own rooms, but we had a purpose, a mission, and we wanted to succeed in that mission. Summer was a fun time for all of us. We were thirteen, and had finished what was effectively our ‘freshman’ year of high school two years early. During that summer we spent a lot of time camping, hiking, fishing (including several trips with Davey’s grandfather), and all the typical summer activities of teenagers. Occasionally we’d have arguments, and fight, but we’d get over it when our tempers calmed down and usually end up laughing over what we fought about. The ‘business’ being started by my family and Davey’s was actually doing quite well. Parts of the idea had come from Davey’s father’s business in the last timeline. David Jones Sr. was proving to be quite a good salesman as he took the idea to companies like Microsoft, which was just starting to rise as a major player, and established giants like IBM. According to their business model it would still be another year before things actually got off the ground, but already they were doing quite well even though they had not yet delivered any finished product. We all ended up going back to the Academy several weeks early for the start of the football training program. The Academy took football quite seriously, and there was quite a bit of grumbling when Trevor ended up on Varsity as second-string quarterback even though he was so young. Davey and I were good, but not quite good enough for the main squad, so we were on the J.V. team along with Brandon. Sean and Todd didn’t arrive until just before school started along with everyone else since they had no interest in playing on the team. Sean’s relationship with his parents was actually better off now than it had been in any other timeline. The distance from them and their not looking over his shoulder all the time was helpful and he actually expressed a grudging change in his desire to see his father meet a grisly fate. Sometimes, distance does make the heart grow fonder. Our term as “Second-Class Cadets” went a lot smoother than our first half-year. We were now accepted by our year-mates as part of their class, and although we only took about half our classes with them, we were no longer strangers. The academic work was much more challenging, largely because our ‘core’ classes were taught in special classes with just the six of us, or sometimes some smaller mix (we all had varying levels of skills in mathematics, so Davey and I ended up in classes with Fourth-Year cadets while the rest were in their own special classes). Trevor enjoyed the football season, even if he only got to play in three games, and only for a total of three quarters. Not everything was perfect. Halfway through the year, Sean ended up before a disciplinary review board for fighting with a Third-Year cadet. The cadet in question was a bully, and had been physically harassing the smaller Sean when Sean unleashed his full fury on the older student. The bully hadn’t stood a chance and ended up in the infirmary with a broken nose while Sean suffered a few bruises. The end result of the disciplinary hearing was that both of them were punished for fighting, but the upper classman received the harsher punishment and a warning that further incidents would result in his removal from school. A much more serious situation arose in the middle of the baseball season. Todd played with us on the team, as did Davey, Brandon, and Trevor. After practice one day, Todd and Trevor disappeared into a little-used shed near the baseball fields and were in the middle of oral sex when a Fourth-Year cadet walked in, finding them. He threatened them with revealing what he’d seen to the faculty if they didn’t ‘service’ him on demand, but was interrupted by the sounds of Davey and I calling out for our friends. Hastily he told them to meet him back there the next day or he’d tell. Naturally Todd and Trevor told us what had happened, and we concocted a plan to deal with the upper classman. I ended up talking with an upper classman on the team after practice, one who we all suspected was gay from the way he took slightly longer looks at everyone in the shower, and we just happened to be walking by the shed as Trevor and Todd were pretty much pushed into the shed by Jason Howell, the cadet who was trying to blackmail them. “Oh no.” Bill Lindstrom, the Fourth-Year I was talking with growled. “What?” I asked. “Wasn’t that two of your friends with Howell?” He asked me. “Yeah.” I agreed, trying to hide my smile. “I can guarantee he’s up to no good.” Lindstrom stated and walked purposefully over to the shed, where we could hear an argument going on inside. “No, we won’t do it!” Trevor’s elevated voice was clearly audible. “I don’t care what you say to people, it’s your word against ours.” “You’ll damn well suck me off, you stupid cocksuckers!” Howell growled at them and Lindstrom got an angry look on his face as he threw the door open and stormed inside. Howell was standing there, his practice pants unbuttoned and half-hard cock flopped out while he stood facing Trevor and Todd. He turned around with a sneer on his face but blanched when he saw Lindstrom. “It’s not what it looks like! I caught these two…” “Stow it, Howell.” Lindstrom growled. “I covered for your ass when I caught you and that First-Year two years ago. Put that fucking thing back in your pants and I better never, ever hear of you harassing anyone again.” Howell stormed out, and I was amazed at our good fortune until Lindstrom turned back to my two friends who were smiling and he managed to give all three of us a glare. “Thank you.” Todd said quickly but was cut off by Lindstrom shaking his head. “Look, let me explain something to the lot of you, and you better sure as hell share it with your friends.” Lindstrom growled. “I know you six think you’re the hottest shit on this campus, but we’re not blind. It’s obvious as hell what you guys do with each other, but as long as you fucking keep it hidden, no one’s going to say anything. Guys like Howell, they’re just looking for a chance to fuck you guys over. You need to be more fucking careful where you do your shit, get it?” “Uh, yeah.” Trevor said with a slightly scared look on his face. “Um, thanks.” “Don’t fucking thank me.” Lindstrom growled. “Someone should have told you guys already. Just fucking tone it down and keep your shit private.” With that he turned and walked out. Later that night, we all had several long discussions and decided to try and tone things down a bit. We had been getting carried away, doing things in places where we could, and in this case, had been caught. After that, we kept it to our rooms, long after lights out for the most part, or managed to use each other as lookouts while the others had some fun. Christmas break of 1982 was fun, and 1983 rolled around without any big surprises for anyone. Davey was growing increasingly worried as the time frame got closer for when his father had started molesting his sister, but he’d done just about everything possible to forestall that from ever happening. He and his sister were a lot closer than they’d ever been before, and they actually corresponded by letter a lot during the school year. By the time summer rolled around, we were all ready for an extended break from the Academy, but Davey and I were a little unprepared for the changes the summer brought. First off, his family was moving in to a home just three doors down from my parents. Then, both of our fathers were gone most of the summer as their business began to take off, and they landed several major contracts with rental firms across the nation. They did take two weeks off towards the tale end of summer, and we were surprised by the trip to Europe. That was when we learned just how well the business was doing. Our families were on the verge of becoming millionaires, and were considering ‘going public’. This time around, there wasn’t likely going to be a need for us to win the lottery. Our families were going to handle that for us just fine. Our third year at the Academy went exceedingly well. In fact, it went way beyond our expectations. Academically, we were very challenged, and for the first time since coming back to this timeline, we all felt like we were being pushed to the full extent of our abilities. Our days were busy, and our nights were spent doing more studying than anything else. During the Spring semester of 1984, there was an elective course that we were allowed to take. The instructor was a retired analyst from the Soviet desk of the CIA. His course was “A History of the USSR and the Future of Communism.” One of the last assignments he gave us towards the end of the course was to write an essay, using full citation of at least eight sources, on what the future held for the Soviet Union. All six of us managed to independently write six essays on the fall of the Soviet Union. None of us collaborated, and although we used some of the same sources for citation, when we reviewed each other’s finished papers, they were different enough that it was obvious we’d each made our own efforts. While all of our conclusions were the same, each of us had reached them in slightly different ways that showed our different way of thinking. Two weeks before the end of the semester, and two weeks after we’d turned in the essays, we were all called into the Superintendent’s office. “Mr. Alstrom was very impressed with the papers each of you wrote.” The retired General said when we were all standing before him. “At first he suspected you’d helped each other with the papers, but after reviewing them he realized you had probably all discussed this topic with each other without having collaborated on what was to be an individual project. Is that correct?” “Yes, sir!” We all answered in unison. “That’s good, I’d hate to think of any of my cadets cheating.” He growled with a warning look at all of us. “Now, Mr. Alstrom was so impressed with your work, that he’s called a few of his friends. I know each of you are much younger than our normal Third-Year cadets, but that shouldn’t hamper your opportunities. When you graduate here after your fourth-year, you will be more than ready for whatever University you choose to attend. Mr. Alstrom has been good enough to cut through the red tape and get an offer extended for each of you to intern with his former employer over the summer. It won’t take up your entire summer, but will be for all but a few weeks. None of you are obligated to accept, but I would consider it a personal favor if as many of you as possible will accept. Young men your age rarely have an opportunity such as this. I won’t lie. Most of what you will be doing will be grunt work, delivering files, making coffee and the like, but you will still learn many things, even if none of you choose it as a career.” “I’ll accept, sir.” Davey said without hesitating. “My parents may not like it all that much, but Dad’s going to be pretty busy except for a few weeks towards the end of summer where he wants to go for another trip. As long as we don’t have to change that, things should work out.” “I’ll contact your parents to make the arrangements.” The General said with a nod and then he looked at me with a raised eyebrow. “Cadet Breckenridge, does this mean you will be going?” “Yes, sir, it does.” I said, and knew from the small smile and nod on his face that he damn well knew Davey and I were a couple, but said nothing. Maybe he thought it was ‘just a phase’, or didn’t even think about it at all, but he did know where one of us went, the other was not far behind. “Count us in too, sir.” Trevor said after sharing a few looks with Todd, whose eyes were bright at the idea of actually getting into the CIA building. “Good choice, gentlemen.” The General said with another short nod. “We might as well go too.” Sean said with a slight sigh. “Excellent.” The General said with a wider grin. “I’ll let Mr. Alstrom know all six of you have accepted. You can expect to receive further details over the next week. Dismissed.” The ‘further details’ amounted to a lot of documents about secrecy that we had to sign, and since we were minors, had to be signed by our parents. Most of what we did that summer really was grunt work. We delivered files, we made coffee, and similar things, but we also talked to several people whose job it was to analyze every bit of data collected about the Soviet Union. Most of them thought we were foolishly naïve children, but we laid some important seeds over the summer. That summer, Davey and I went with our families to West Germany, France, and Italy. It was odd, having traveled to a lot of these countries in other timelines, mostly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the European Union. The checkpoints at different borders that no longer existed after the mid-1990’s were a unique experience, especially after having spent most of the summer at the CIA. Our last year at the Academy was the toughest yet, with our instructors having spent most of the last few years learning our strengths and weaknesses. The school wasn’t really a big one, so they got to know all of their students fairly well, and they used that information mercilessly to challenge us in a variety of ways. In sports, Trevor was the starting quarterback, and even managed to attract the attention of a few college scouts, our faculty members had tipped off the scouts to this amazingly talented fifteen-year old who would be eligible for college next year. Nearly every week, we got at least two or three brochures for several top-notch universities and we began to discuss among ourselves what we would do for the future. That was why in late November of that year, after spending Thanksgiving at home with our families, we all met over at Trevor’s house the day before we were to fly back to school. His parents were both out, visiting some friends, and so we met in their dining room. We had all brought the tons of brochures and letters we’d received from various universities, colleges, and from various other institutions offering scholarships. “First off, I think we need to make a final decision on what to do about our dear friend, the mad scientist.” Sean said with a sarcastic drawl after we were all settled in at the table. “We can plant evidence that points to him working with the Soviets.” I offered. In the last timeline they had been hesitant to kill people, and even though they’d been on board for removal after coming back, offering this way out might be a better option for them. “He can’t invent time travel if he’s in jail for the rest of his life.” “Not good enough.” Sean disagreed with a shake of his head. “He can still do the mathematics, and we all know that with enough money anything is possible. Guys, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. None of you know the man the way I do. He’s obsessed with this, and nothing short of death will stop him. The only way I can see that we guarantee he and Shevardnadze do not meet up would be to make sure he is dead.” “Or Shevardnadze.” Davey added grimly as he nodded his head in agreement. “Of course, we won’t be able to get near Shevardnadze.” “No, which is why the man who first invented time travel is the one who has to die.” Sean said, taking back the discussion. “I think I know just how to do it too. A story in the news last year gave me a good idea. One of the things that bugged me about the guy is that he smokes like a chimney. There were a few times I had to go over to his house first thing in the morning. He’s had the same house since the 1960’s, this little two-bedroom thing built during the depression. The place stank like you wouldn’t believe, and the first thing he did when he got up every morning was to light up a cigarette even before he was out of bed.” “So?” Trevor asked with a confused look. “We know he doesn’t die of cancer.” “No, but he does have a gas stove.” Sean said grimly. “If we got in there, turned off the pilot light at night, made sure all the windows were closed, and left a burner on, he’d blow up when he had his morning smoke.” Davey said with a little grin on his face. “That’s a lot of if’s, there Sean.” “He has bad allergies some times.” Sean said with a shrug. “Part of the reason why the place stank so bad was that he never opens the windows to air it out. It’ll work. I know it.” “If it doesn’t, we can work on a fallback plan.” I offered. Everyone looked uncomfortable, but no one objected. “Now, which of us will do it, and when? We should make sure whoever goes has a good alibi just in case.” “What about his neighbors?” Todd asked with a frown. “Won’t we be risking hurting them too if his house just blows up?” “His nearest neighbor is several hundred yards away.” Sean said with a shrug. “They’ll be fine. And I’ll do it. I know the house. I’ve been in there in the other timeline.” “Won’t he hear you breaking in?” Trevor asked. “I’ve been thinking about this.” Sean said with a grin. “In the nineties, he always kept a spare key under the back door. I bet it’s there in this timeline too. He likes to make his assistants go get things that he might have left at home so he just leaves a spare key where they can find it easily. I’ll wait until he goes to bed, maybe an hour after that, and then I’ll go in, blow out the pilot light and leave the burner on. He’s always making tea in a kettle, so I’ll put the kettle over the burner, make it look like he’d left it on and didn’t realize it or something. That should be enough to throw any possible suspicion off it being foul play.” “What if you’re seen?” Brandon asked. “I don’t want you going to jail.” “I can do it without being seen.” Sean said confidently. “Besides, you guys will be my alibi, right?” “Yeah.” Davey said thoughtfully. “How about we do this over Spring Break? We’ve got that camping trip planned. All of us are planning to go to the DMV together and get our licenses right? And then we’ve already told our families we’re going camping for three days. That’ll give Sean one day to watch the place, and then another to actually do it.” “I’m going with him.” Brandon said fiercely and no one objected. “We’ll be able to give you both good alibis, especially if we go up on a back trail for most of the day.” Trevor added. “Okay, sounds like that’s settled. What’s next?” “College.” I said and everyone looked around nervously for a moment. “Look, I have to wonder if we’ve all been thinking along similar lines.” Trevor said after the silence had almost become uncomfortable. “Don’t get me wrong, I love all you guys. The thing is, we’ve been together, living together, working together, in each other’s pockets for damn near ten years now over two timelines. I’d like to be out on my own for a while, at least the four years it’ll take to finish up an undergraduate degree.” “What about me?” Todd asked with a mock pout and Trevor smiled while Brandon and Sean chuckled. “You know I don’t mean you in that.” Trevor said softly. “I’d just like it to be you and me for a bit, you know. Focus on us more, instead of the group.” “I’d like that too.” Todd agreed. “So would I.” Davey added as he looked at me. “No offense guys.” “It sounds like we’ve been thinking along the same lines.” Brandon chuckled. “So, what school have you picked, Trevor?” “USC.” Trevor said. “They offered me a football scholarship, and they’ve got that film program Todd’s been interested in since the last timeline. Brian, you always said you could work that into your plans.” “I can.” I agreed. “Good.” Todd said with a determined look. “What about you guys, Brandon and Sean?” “MIT, full-ride scholarships for both of us.” Sean said proudly as he held up two letters that he and Brandon had brought. “I’ve got engineering. It’ll be a nice change from Physics now that I don’t have to babysit that bastard again.” “Computer science for me.” Brandon added with a slight shrug. “This time I can get a proper education in the subject.” “Sorry about that.” I said quietly and he chuckled. “Wasn’t your fault, Bri.” Brandon stated. “They just didn’t have a halfway decent program.” “What about you two?” Sean asked with a slightly worried look. “You said you went to Stanford in your first timeline. You going to go there again?” “No.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “He went there so that I could pitch on the baseball team.” “Now there’s a joke.” Trevor chuckled as everyone else laughed. “Davey Jones pitching!” “Shut up.” Davey said defensively. Sure, he could throw a ball halfway decently after years and years of practice with us, but he was nowhere near being pitcher-quality in an amateur league, much less college ball. “We’re going to Whitman College.” I said to cut off the teasing Davey was getting. Everyone looked confused. “I’ve never heard of it.” Brandon stated. “It’s a CIA school.” Davey said. “Well, it’s a school with a program specific for the CIA.” “I thought you were staying away from the CIA after our little internship?” Brandon said to me with a confused look. “He’s doing it because I want to do it.” Davey said. “I like it. I want to do it.” “Which is why we’re going there.” I stated firmly. “But what about the long-range plans?” Trevor asked with a confused expression. “We abandoning them?” “No.” Davey said with a sigh. “I’ll have a couple years in by the mid-nineties, and Brian and I can go back to school, get our Masters degrees and then go over to State. It’s not like the mafia, really.” “If you think you can pull that off.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “Well, I guess that was pretty easy to do.” “Yeah, but don’t worry, we won’t lose touch with each other.” I assured them. “We’ve been through too much for that.” “No fucking shit.” Davey snorted, and we all laughed together before Trevor’s parents got home. Chapter 23 When we graduated from the Robinson Academy, we were part of a graduating class of sixty-three. All sixty-three graduates of the Academy went on to college, something not quite unusual for that school, but unusual in most public schools. Fourteen of those graduates went on to one of the four military Academies. Five (including Sean and Brandon) went to MIT. Most went to Ivy League schools like Yale or Harvard. Davey and I were the only two going to a little school in the heavily wooded area of Washington State where Whitman was located. Or rather, where we had planned to attend when we graduated. “This is weird.” Davey said as we unpacked our bags in the dorm room, two weeks before school started. “Yes, it is.” I agreed with him. We were both halfway through our sixteenth year, and freshmen about to begin our first year in college. “Did you see the house?” Davey asked me and I nodded. The dorm room was one of those on the top floor of the building, providing a spectacular view of the surrounding area. Well, it would be spectacular if you were the least bit interested. At least the dorm room we had been assigned was just the two of us instead of one of the bigger rooms. We had gotten here about an hour ago, and after doing our check-in were almost unpacked. “I did.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out as a sigh. I had not realized until I’d seen it how much I’d loved that house. “This is going to suck.” Davey said as he finished connecting the last connection on his computer and he sat down to boot it up. He had gotten his buzz cut freshened up back in Modesto before we’d left for college. We were supposed to let our hair grow out a bit more, but he’d complained about it itching too much and decided to see if he could get away with one more haircut before the fall semester started. “You want me to remind you it’s your fault?” I said in a tight voice and he actually laughed sharply before shaking his head. “Would it help if I said I was sorry?” He said as he turned around in his chair and gave me a pouting look. “Oh stop that.” I said with irritation and he smiled, knowing I’d already forgiven him. Damn it, what were they thinking? We were only sixteen! “Don’t worry, it’s not like we’re really sixteen.” He said after seeing the expression on my face. I gave another sigh, and nodded my head in agreement. Instead of arguing further I went over and hugged him, giving him a kiss on the top of the head. “I’m going to go for a walk.” I said gently and he nodded as his computer finished booting up and he turned back around. He’d already hooked up the phone line to the 4,800 baud modem and would be making sure everything worked just fine. Shutting the door behind me I went out and took the elevator down to the first floor. With a nod for the sleepy student at the front desk I left the building, barely wincing as the heat hit me like a wall. I’d survived Arizona before, and while I wasn’t happy to be back here instead of nice, cool Washington, it wasn’t going to kill me. We were here early, and except for some athletes, most of the campus was still fairly empty as I walked around the familiar environs of Arizona State. To be honest, I was feeling a little lonely without Trevor, Brandon, Sean, and Todd around. We had made other friends at Robinson, but the six of us had been a fairly insular group for all those years. Now it was just Davey and me here at this school. Both Sean and Brandon had been remote ever since Spring Break, when the two of them had left our campsite for the mission in Livermore. They’d returned very quiet, and had barely spoken a word the rest of the weekend except to say that they were successful. We’d all been quiet for the rest of the week with the realization that we’d all contributed to the killing of another human being, who had not yet done anything. Trevor had confirmed it for us, by speaking with his father when we returned. Trevor had brought up a story in talking with his father about how a student at the Academy had been caught smoking in his room. His father had shaken his head, and commented that smoking was stupid and dangerous. One of his co-workers at the lab had died just a few days before when his pilot light had gone out during the night, and the man had woken up and lit a cigarette. That was all the confirmation we’d needed, and towards the end of summer we’d all breathed a sigh of relief when we’d not heard anything more or any whisper that the death had raised suspicions. After making a circuit of the central part of the campus, I made my way up, past the dormitories and by the stadium. Memories of Trevor playing football there came to the forefront of my mind, and I shook my head while a half-smile flitted onto my face. As much as I wanted to be mad at Davey for getting us into this… situation, I could not really blame him. The Davey Jones I had first met in my original timeline had over a century of experiences behind him, and he’d done just about everything he’d ever dreamed of doing, except maybe making it into space. When I came back in time, I’d known that there would be a lot of challenges, and one of those would be that the Davey Jones I was meeting would not have had those experiences. Davey had told me, in the original timeline, that he’d craved adventure and excitement when he was younger. That had led him into many interesting experiences. In my first trip back in time, Davey had been patient, but after Sean had come back he’d gotten a taste of being involved with ‘the big picture’ in a direct way, and I knew that deep down part of him craved something similar in this timeline. That was why I’d pushed him and my friends to the Robinson Academy. I’d hoped it’s ‘military’ elements would keep him satisfied, but they’d just fed his hunger for something more, and so now here we were, involved with America’s spy agency. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I hoped it wouldn’t have too many effects on the long-range plans for the future. It shouldn’t, but as I’d already learned, the future wasn’t written and even the most prepared or experienced time traveler could run into the unexpected. “You’re back!” Davey said when I came back to our dorm room. He got out of the chair in front of the computer and crossed over to hug me as soon as I’d closed the door behind me. “You smell good.” I said as I caught the scent of the cologne he was wearing. “You’re sweaty, and you smell good too.” Davey said in a familiar, husky tone. Even as I leaned forward a bit more to kiss him comfortably, I could feel him hardening in his jeans. By the time we were done, we were both sweaty, and feeling very good as we laid together on one of the narrow dorm beds. It was a good thing we had four years of practice sleeping together in small beds at the Academy. “I like it when you greet me like that.” I said as I ran a finger along his side. He shivered slightly at the touch. “So you forgive me for getting you into this?” He asked in a very soft tone. “Yes.” I said without hesitation. “Sorry, you know how I get when plans get changed.” “You and your plans.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. It was probably his biggest frustration with me. I didn’t react well when my plans were de-railed or sidetracked. “I’ll get over it like I always do.” I said as I reached around discovered to my joy that he was ready for another round. He sighed as my hand began to stroke him gently. “I love it when you do that.” He said quietly, and it was another hour before we were walking down the hallway to the showers. Two football players were in there, and greeted us with nods before heading out. That night we ate at a restaurant on Mill Avenue before heading to the theater where we watched a movie both of us had already seen in another timeline. Then we headed back to the dorm room. We could have easily afforded the house, or other off-campus living quarters, but our ‘handler’ at the CIA wanted us to live on-campus. Thus we were going to get the ‘full’ experience on campus this year. We were even being encouraged to pledge a frat if the opportunity arose. Davey seemed to like the idea, and if he wanted it, I’d go along with him. “Brian, I’m excited.” Davey said later that night as we lay together in one of the two beds. “Excited?” I asked. “Yeah, excited.” Davey said with a sigh. “Sorry, it’s just, you know, I’ve got this feeling like anything can happen. I know you put a lot of time and effort into your plans, and they’re good plans, but I feel like right now anything can happen and that excites me. Part of me feels like we’re going to be getting to go to school for real now, unlike last time. With all the others around, last time felt like just an extension of high school, but now it’s just us and that’s exciting.” “I understand.” I told him gently and he snuggled up tighter against me. His breathing became regular as he drifted off to sleep, and I was falling asleep soon after. The next morning we had our interview with Professor Lee. He looked no different than he had in the last timeline, and we spent a good hour sitting in his office talking in nothing but Russian. That had been one of our courses for the last four years, giving us both a good reason for being proficient in the language. After we were done, he had signed off on putting us in the advanced-level language courses. With that mission accomplished, we headed back downtown to the coffee shop that we’d enjoyed with our friends in the last timeline. Then, our families showed up in the late afternoon, and we went out with all of them. Jenny was fourteen now, getting ready to start high school. Her parents had offered to send her to a boarding school, but she insisted on going to Downey. Last year, the company our parents started had gone public, and at least on paper they were now millionaires with their stock options. By and large, they hadn’t changed how they lived much, and even Davey’s mother was trying to live her life as if not much had changed, but they did enjoy a few things, like staying at the more expensive Biltmore Resort while in Phoenix, and going out to dinner at the more expensive restaurants in town. They stayed for three days before heading back, and Davey and I got down to business preparing for the upcoming semester. The truth is, I love school. I enjoy learning, even if it’s learning something over again. Each time is a little different, and the classes I had that first semester were all slightly different than those I’d had in the last timeline, and of course different than those I’d had at Stanford. Another thing I had discovered is that while some schools have a deserved reputation for excellence in education, the quality of any education, at any school depended on two primary factors: The desire, or motivation, of the teacher to actually teach and the desire of the student to learn. The finest teacher, with the finest materials, the best-prepared curricula and lessons plans, and the absolute finest in teaching aides is wasted if a student has no desire to learn. Likewise, the best-prepared, highly motivated, eager student is wasting his time if the teacher in front of him has no desire to really teach. Good textbooks, lab equipment, support staff, office hours, money for extra materials and other supporting mechanisms are important, but given two bare essentials: a good teacher and a good student, it is possible to achieve the best in education with little else. That was one of Arizona State’s greatest resources: their professors. For the most part, their professors were eager to teach, and knew their subjects very well. While at many other institutions of higher learning, research was the main goal of professors, here there was still a strong ethos of instructing amongst the professors. By carefully selecting certain professors, both Davey and I managed to construct a course schedule for the first year that kept us interested in our courses. We also developed friendships with several other students. By its very nature, the university’s foreign language programs tended to produce tight-knit groups of students. Studying a language effectively took more than going to class and doing the assigned homework. Watching movies in that language, reading literature in that language, and actually holding conversation in the language was necessary to move from a basic proficiency into actual competence. Many of the students we joined that year had been studying the language together for three years already, and while at first we were interlopers, they quickly grew to accept us as part of their group. Of those students, they were all in their early to mid-twenties, and so there was a slight age gap between us at first, especially when they would go out drinking on the weekends, but as the semester stretched on, it became less of a barrier. Davey and I went home to Modesto for Thanksgiving, and our families seemed to enjoy the tales we had to tell of life at ASU. Davey’s father practically beamed with pride at having his son go to that school. The man was not the same as the David Jones Sr. who had become President, but he was closer to that man than the one in the previous timeline. Davey was understandably proud of him. It was Davey’s mother who cast a little cloud over the holiday with a single comment. “Now that you boys are at a school with girls, have either of you started dating yet?” His mother asked us with a piercing look. My parents looked a little uncomfortable, having figured us out long ago, but his parents were still largely in the dark about the true nature of our relationship. “Mom!” Davey exclaimed with a slight blush. “The youngest girls at ASU are all eighteen or older! I’m jailbait to them!” “Oh.” His mother said with a worried frown. “What about girls from one of the high schools?” “I go to college.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “What mother is going to want her daughter dating a college student?” “That might be a problem.” His mother said with a shake of her head. “Don’t worry, son.” Davey’s father said with a smile. “In just over a year you’ll be eighteen. Plenty of time for that.” “Thanks dad.” Davey said with a shake of his head. His hair, like mine was growing out a bit, and we both needed at least a trim to keep our hair looking neat. We managed to hook up with our friends the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and we all spent most of the day up at Don Pedro Reservoir, sitting in a rented boat in the middle of the lake and talking about the last few months. None of us were extensive letter-writers, and e-mail was still a few years away as a means for us to communicate. Davey and I had a phone in our dorm room, but we were the only couple that had that luxury. So, we spent the day catching up with our friends. “We miss you guys.” Todd said about halfway through the day. “But, well, it’s like we’re learning how to make other friends at school. It’s kind of weird, like maybe that when we were all together we didn’t really need other people so we shut them out. Don’t take it the wrong way, but it’s nice making new friends again.” “It is.” Davey agreed. “Just don’t think we’re going to forget you guys, though.” “No, we’ll always be the best of friends.” Sean agreed while everyone nodded. When we returned to Arizona, almost everyone was focused on the upcoming finals. They were weeks away, and there were still parties every weekend that we both managed to attend. We had gotten invitations to pledge several frats on campus, but Davey had decided (wisely in my opinion) that he didn’t really want to be a ‘frat’. Both of us were certain we’d done well on our finals, and we left Arizona for the extended winter break. Unlike the last timeline, we weren’t taking Winter Session courses, and so we stayed in Modesto from late December all the way until the weekend before Spring Semester started. Our parents now had a big office in downtown Modesto, and we began to realize just how big their business was growing. Dad had mentioned they’d taken the company public a few months ago, but our Christmas presents included stock in their company. When we realized the stock we had been given was valued at nearly a million dollars for each of us, I was floored. This was far better than providing a winning lottery ticket had been. The one troubling point was Davey’s mother and grandmothers both throwing girls at him the entire time we were back in Modesto. He even went on two ‘dates’, and I’d commiserated with him over the awful time he’d had on the dates. Davey wanted to wait until he was eighteen though, before telling them the truth about our relationship. It would make dealing with any fallout from them easier. When school started up, it was proving to be a hectic semester. The other students in our Russian courses were by and large preparing to go to the Soviet Union for the summer. The university’s Russian language program had managed to once again obtain approval from both governments for a summer-length study program at Moscow State University. Many of the students from our classes would be spending the summer there. Davey and I were still too young, by a year, to go, but we knew that next year would be our year to take part in the program. That was why we’d been sent to ASU in the first place. By the end of the semester, we’d managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA, and fully establish ourselves as regular, if a little young, students at ASU. During the summer, Davey and I spent several weeks at an ‘intensive’ Slavic-language program being offered by Rutgers. Davey was in a staged ‘accident’ that resulted in him needing to have some plastic surgery. At first I didn’t like the way his nose had been changed, or the slightly different shape of his eyes, but the changes grew on me after a while. “Dude, I like the new nose.” Trevor said when we met up with him and Todd over the summer. Brandon and Sean were taking summer session courses at MIT, and we’d just missed them by two days. “Shut up.” Davey responded to Trevor sharply. He’d always been a little sensitive about his nose, and now that it was narrower, and no longer had that little ‘hump’ halfway down, I could see him staring at himself in the mirror a lot. His eyes were more almond-shaped now as well, but the changes were less immediately noticeable. “So, other than your face getting smashed up, everything else is alright after your car accident?” Todd asked in a slightly worried tone. “Yes, everything’s fine.” Davey assured our old friends. Not even they were to be told yet about the real reasons why the surgery had happened. For that matter, we didn’t even know the full story yet. Phoenix was still hot when we returned for the new semester. Sure, Modesto got hot during the summer months, but it never got quite as hot as Phoenix. Once again we got a good dorm room and went through the typical routine of unpacking and setting our room up for the next year. Within a few days we were settled in and ready to begin the next round of classes. Last year, we’d finished the highest level of undergraduate Russian language courses that were regularly offered, so this year we were given special upper-division classes where we studied under two professors. We also were assigned as ‘assistants’ to the beginning-level courses, and as the months wore on, found ourselves making a fairly lucrative business in tutoring some students. Most of the students we tutored were freshmen, and were usually only a year or two older than us. That led to a situation that had me very nervous, and caused one of the most serious arguments yet. Matt Stoler was a handsome young man, eighteen, and he kept looking at Davey in a way that made me very nervous. Worse yet, Davey responded to his smiles with smiles of his own, and the body language between the two of them was far more friendly than made me comfortable. “Brian, you worried about me and Todd when we first got together.” Davey said with a hint of scorn in his voice when I broached the topic. “After all these years I’d have thought you could learn to trust me by now.” “I do trust you.” I told him. “I don’t trust Matt.” “It takes two to tango, Brian.” Davey said in a warning tone. His statement worked both ways, really. He was telling me that nothing would happen because he wouldn’t let it, and he was telling me that it took both of us to make our relationship work, or to not work.” “You’re right.” I said with a sigh. “I’m sorry. It’s just that, well, you look so damn good I know you could have any guy you wanted…” “I only want you, Brian.” He said in a tone that made my heart melt. That night I was sure our neighbors heard what we were doing, but we didn’t really care. It was too much fun. It was the day before we left for Thanksgiving when something happened that affirmed my reasons for worrying. Davey was tutoring Matt in our dorm room while I was out supervising a make-up exam for Professor Lee. It was an oral exam, with the students having to recite several poems, and afterwards I spent an extra half-hour with two of them, helping them to fix their pronunciation of certain words. After I was done, I headed back to our dorm room, and was just opening the door when I heard the familiar sounds of two people kissing. There was Davey and Matt, whose back was to me, kissing on my bed! Instead of erupting and making a scene, I started to close the door with a sinking heart when Matt fell to the floor. With the door just open a crack, I couldn’t see much, but I could hear what was being said, and my heart started to climb back out of my feet. Matt was on the floor because Davey had pushed him there. “What do you think you’re doing?” Davey snarled angrily. “I… uh… I thought you were…” Matt stammered with real fright in his voice. “You thought what?” Davey snarled again. “I thought you were… you know… like me.” Matt stammered even more. “You know… gay.” “Yeah, I’m gay.” Davey stated with anger dripping off of every syllable. “What makes you think you can kiss me, though?” “I’m sorry.” Matt said softly. “I just thought if you were gay, you wouldn’t mind hooking up. I mean, everyone says you and Brian are both gay.” “We’re a couple.” Davey said firmly. “I’m not interested in anyone but him. If you knew that we were gay, what made you think I’d cheat on him?” “You’re a guy, aren’t you?” Matt shot back and Davey laughed. “Just because I’m a guy, don’t think that means I’ll cheat on someone I love.” Davey said around his laughter. “Brian and I have been together for longer than you’d believe, and I’m not about to risk my relationship with him, no matter how cute someone is.” “You think I’m cute?” Matt said in a pleased tone. “You’re easy enough on the eyes.” Davey said. “Brian’s better though.” “Oh.” Matt said softly. “I’m sorry I misunderstood.” “Just don’t try something like that again.” Davey said firmly, and I walked away from the room. When I came back an hour later, Davey smiled as I handed him a dozen red roses. “You heard, didn’t you?” Davey asked with a smile. “Yep.” I admitted with a slight blush. “What did you see?” Davey asked curiously. “I opened the door when he was kissing you.” I was blushing furiously now. “And you didn’t make a scene?” Davey asked with a tilt of his head. “I heard you push him to the floor, and stayed around to hear the rest of the conversation.” I admitted, looking at the floor. “So you know you can trust me, don’t you?” Davey said softly, but there was an edge to his voice. “Yes, and I’m sorry I ever doubted you.” I said softly. “You were right though, too, about what he was after.” Davey gave me that much. “Thanks for the roses.” “They’re not half as beautiful as you.” I said, and that got me a very deep, passionate kiss. It was the day after Thanksgiving when Trevor’s father called Davey and invited us to his house that evening. Davey and I were both a little confused when we arrived and found that Trevor and Mrs. Rush were both gone, and two men were waiting with Mr. Rush. We recognized one of them as the ‘handler’ we’d been working with from the CIA. “Mr. Breckenridge, Mr. Jones, this is Walter Ameson, my supervisor.” Richard Long, the handler introduced us to the older man with white hair. “I was surprised when Mr. Long called me and said he needed my help.” Mr. Rush said as we all sat back down. “It has been some years since I had contact with the Agency. I was more surprised when I found out you two boys were involved with them. You have not gotten Trevor involved in whatever this is, have you?” “No, sir.” Davey said cautiously while Long nodded. “What’s going on?” “You two young men have expressed an interest in working with the Agency while you were still in High School.” Ameson explained. “I believe you both remember your summer internships. Your group of friends and you had some strange ideas, but they are starting to appear not to be as far-fetched as we first assumed. Unfortunately, our operations are not geared towards obtaining the kind of information we would need to verify some of the theories that are now being kicked around by our analysts. That is where you come in, Mr. Jones.” “Me?” Davey asked with surprise. “Yes, you.” Mr. Long added. “You’ve been very good about doing what we ask without demanding an explanation. Now, your patience is about to pay off.” “We were quite nervous when Mr. Long brought up this idea, especially since it centered on such a young person.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “Still, you appear to be quite an unusual young man, very mature, and we are going to take this risk.” “What risk?” Davey asked cautiously. “Davey, you were born here in Modesto, right?” Mr. Rush asked. “Yes, at Modesto City Hospital.” Davey stated. “Trevor was born at the same hospital.” Mr. Rush stated. “It was six weeks after you, as you know.” “Yes.” Davey murmured. “My wife and I were at the hospital the same night you were born.” Mr. Rush said and Davey’s eyebrows rose. “In fact, I think I remember seeing your mother brought in to the Labor and Delivery area. She was quite…vocal about wanting you out of her.” “I can imagine.” Davey said with a slightly stunned look on his face. I was surprised too, since this was the first I’d heard of it in three timelines. Trevor’s parents had been there the night Davey was born? “Do you not wonder why we were at the hospital?” Mr. Rush asked and Davey nodded. “You see, my sister was pregnant at almost the same time as my wife. They were only a month apart.” “I’ve never met your sister.” Davey said quietly. “She died in childbirth.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “I’m sorry.” Davey said immediately and Mr. Rush shrugged it off. “She went into labor three weeks early.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “She didn’t know it, but she was bearing twins. Something went wrong inside of her, and she went into labor prematurely. The first boy was delivered without too much trouble, but the second had gotten the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck during the birth process. The hospital was a mess that night with your mother and three other women, all giving birth at the same time. The twins were fraternal, not identical. You do understand the difference?” “Fraternal are from different eggs inseminated at the same time instead of one egg that splits into two separate embryos.” Davey said automatically. “Yes.” Mr. Rush continued. “The second twin died before he could be delivered by emergency cesarean section. My sister also died later that night.” “I’m very sorry.” Davey said quietly. “What happened to the one that survived?” “He was returned to his father.” Mr. Rush frowned. “I am still sorry about that.” Mr. Ameson said to Mr. Rush. “He found out about the delivery and there was nothing we could do to prevent it when he made the demand.” “What does…” Davey began to ask, mostly to cover the fact we already knew Mr. Rush was a defector. In this timeline we were not supposed to know that. “I was not born in the United States.” Mr. Rush said, in Russian. Davey and I both managed to put appropriate expressions of surprise on our faces. “Sereosna?” Davey asked in Russian, the word for ‘seriously’. “Pravda.” Mr. Ameson replied with a slight smile. Simply put, he was saying it was ‘truth’. “My wife and I came to the United States because we did not want our child born under communism.” Mr. Rush continued in English. Then he told the story we’d heard before, except this time we found out that his sister had come with him. From the expression on his face, I could understand why that had never been mentioned before. It seemed the memory was very painful for him, and it explained why he had very rarely spoken of it in any of the timelines. His sister had been a secretary for a mid-level bureaucrat in the Foreign Affairs office. She had helped them arrange their defection, and gone with them. The father of her unborn children was an older man, who would now be in his early sixties, and had not had any children by his wife. After the mother had died in childbirth, he had demanded his son be returned to him, and legally there had been no way to stop him short of creating an international incident. “The boy, Dmitry Verakov, died about a year ago in an auto accident while vacationing in Eastern Europe.” Mr. Ameson continued the story after Mr. Rush fell silent. He took out a picture from a briefcase next to his chair and showed it to us. Several things fell into place at once. “You want to use Davey to get close to this man.” I said while Davey stared at the picture. The young guy in the picture was handsome, and he looked a lot like Davey, in fact, with the changes to Davey’s appearance, I’d have very few doubts they were brothers. “Did the other twin really die?” Davey asked in quiet voice, and Mr. Long chuckled. “Are you thinking maybe you were adopted?” He asked Davey with a very amused expression. “This guy looks a lot like me.” Davey said, pointing at the picture. “Not only that, he has the same blood type as you.” Mr. Ameson added. “Although, if a genetic test were to be done, you’d find that you do not really share his genetics. It is just a fortuitous resemblance, and the fact that your blood type is the same is an even bigger stroke of luck.” “So I’m not really…” Davey’s voice drifted off. “No, you are no relation to Mikhail Markovich Verakov, although when he sees you we believe that he will suspect a great deal.” Mr. Ameson stated. “A check of your blood type will prove that you could be his son, and that will likely be enough for him. He is currently a high-level assistant to the Politburo member responsible for overseeing domestic production of consumer goods in the Soviet Union. As such, he has access to much of the economic data that we have failed to acquire.” “You want me to get him to defect?” Davey asked. “If it’s possible.” Ameson stated. “If not, wiggle your way into his life, his home, and learn as much as you can. Pass that information to Mr. Breckenridge, who will bring it back to the United States. Make Verakov believe that you are his lost son. His wife died two years ago, and his son last year. He is a very lonely man right now.” “And the whole idea is just plain insane.” Davey said with disbelief. “What makes you think I can do this?” “Please, Mr. Jones, you’re quite capable of hiding secrets.” Mr. Long said with a snort. “It took us until two months ago to verify that you and Mr. Breckenridge are homosexuals in a long-term relationship. We still have not been able to find out when that relationship started. Three FBI agents doing background checks on you both failed to uncover that information.” “Matt.” Davey said flatly and Mr. Long grinned. “He didn’t know who he was doing it for, just that he was being paid to see if he could seduce you.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “That is why we are including Mr. Breckenridge in this. We assume you will not wish to go without him.” “Aren’t you worried that Verakov will find out and get mad?” Davey asked. “When it comes to the children of powerful men like him, the Soviet Union will often turn a blind eye.” Ameson stated. “Well, that or they’ll seek to use it as a hammer hanging over his head if he steps out of line. No, both of you should be quite safe when they find out about your relationship.” “You make it sound like it is for certain.” I stated. “Yes, Mr. Breckenridge.” Long said with a grin. “Both of your files will indicate that you were rejected for service with the Agency because of your sexual preference. It is the policy of the United States that homosexuals are not to be trusted.” “But you trust us.” I stated with a raised eyebrow. “Call me an enlightened individual.” Long said with a shrug. “You both are very unique individuals.” Ameson added. “We would not normally even think of such a hairbrained scheme as this, but you are both fairly mature, obviously able to keep secrets without looking like you’re keeping secrets, and have shown yourselves to be dependable. If you accept this plan, this will be the last time we officially meet. The two of you will apply for the Study Abroad program that is scheduled for next summer. You will both be eighteen by then, and legal adults.” “While you are there, you will be invited to attend several events.” Long continued. “At least one of those will be attended by comrade Verakov. He often gets sent in the place of his boss. Make sure that you meet him, and if possible speak to him. Let him take things from there. Mr. Jones, you will use Mr. Breckenridge to pass any information learned out of the Soviet Union. We suggest that if an offer for you to stay with comrade Verakov is made, that you accept. Mr. Breckenridge should be able to pass back and forth between the United States and the Soviet Union every few months.” “Mr. Breckenridge, you will pass your information along through Mr. Rush.” Ameson took up the explanation. “We suggest you write nothing down, nor take any incriminating photographs. Both of you have shown that your memory is near-perfect. That is the safest way for you to pass information to each other. Mr. Rush can put it in written form, and send the reports in through his regular channels.” “You will both be paid for your work, if this succeeds.” Long finished. “We will protect your identities by listing you as being denied for service, but Mr. Rush will receive a significant raise in his living allowance that we pay him. When this is over, I believe you both trust him enough to pay you appropriately.” “We trust him.” Davey didn’t hesitate to reply but he got a worried look on his face. “How long am I supposed to do this for?” “Until Mr. Verakov dies, retires, or the Soviet Union ceases to exist.” Ameson stated and Davey looked at me with a worried expression. “Brian?” “It’s up to you.” I told him. “You’re the one who wanted to get involved with the bloody Agency.” “I… you know… I… uh… I can’t do this. Sorry.” Davey stammered after a moment. “Why not?” Ameson asked with a frown. “I… Brian doesn’t really want to be involved in this cloak and dagger stuff and I won’t drag him along.” Davey said. “You’re right, we are a couple, and we’d have to do this together or not at all.” “Thank you, Davey.” I said quietly, putting a hand on his shoulder and not caring about the other men in the room. “But you know you want to do this, don’t you?” “Yes, but…” Davey protested. “We’ll do it.” I said to Ameson who nodded, although he was obviously trying not to look at my hand on Davey’s shoulder. “Why?” Long said. “It’ll help our country, and Davey really wants to do it.” I said with a shrug. “I like spoiling him.” “I love you.” Davey breathed out in a whisper, and he was smiling from ear to ear. Chapter 24 It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.”",

      "content": "“They would not be interested in the likes of me.” Verakov said with a snort. “I know nothing of military secrets. My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.” “They would not be interested in the likes of me.” Verakov said with a snort. “I know nothing of military secrets. My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. Chapter 25 “I do not think you understand the importance of being able to dream of a better life.” Davey said to his ‘father’ as we rode in the car back into Moscow. For the past week we’d stayed in the dacha while the old man took the time ‘off’ from work. Not that he did no work. He had an office in the dacha, and spent many hours on the phone when he was not entertaining the two of us. It had now been a few days more than three weeks since that first trip out to the dacha, and we were now heading back into Moscow for the official ‘results’ of the test. Davey and I were both nervous, since we couldn’t see how the CIA would have been able to fake those results. “You do not understand the importance of knowing your place in life, and being assured that you will have safety and security when you are old and infirm.” Verakov countered Davey’s assertion. “What good are silken dreams when they do not put food on your table or a roof over your head?” “What good is a roof over your head when you know your children will never achieve more than you have?” Davey retorted. This particular argument had been raging for two days now, and both of them were enjoying it immensely. If I had to be honest, I was enjoying it too. “In America you can have both.” I added my voice to the argument, drawing looks from both of them. There were smiles on both their faces. The truth was I liked Verakov, probably more than I liked this timeline’s version of Davey’s father. “Social security guarantees the elderly will have money in their retirement, although they do not have to depend on that alone. They can save, have their own pensions to supplement what they get from the state. If they are smart enough to purchase their own home while they are working, they will have paid it off by the time they retire, and are even more free to enjoy the fruits of a life of labor.” “But you have millions of homeless.” Verakov pounced with a wolfish smile. “Millions of your elderly, and your mentally ill roam your streets and sleep in doorways while trying to stay warm! Your Social Security does not save them!” “There is no homelessness in the Soviet Union?” Davey shot back. “None worth mentioning.” Verakov snorted. “Again, I ask what use are there dreams of yours when you can not feed your hungry or shelter your homeless?” “How much grain is being imported this year from the United States?” I asked and the man blinked at me before laughing. “No system is perfect, but we are getting there.” He countered with a slight shrug. It was true the Soviet Union imported grain every year from the United States. Their collective farming system was…inefficient in the extreme. They should have been able to grow enough food to feed their own people, but they didn’t. In some cases, it wasn’t the collectives that were the problem though. Some grew more than enough food, but that food rotted in storage because there were no trucks to take it where it was needed. It was facts like these that had ultimately led to the fall of the Soviet Union, and while we might argue about them with Verakov, we didn’t want them to change anytime soon. In less than six months, the beginning of the end would happen for the Soviet Union with the first elections in Hungary and Poland. Then the Berlin Wall would fall, and within two years of that, the Soviet Union would cease to exist. An idea was beginning to form in my head, an avenue of opportunity that had never been available to us before, but was now opening. One of the things my original Davey had always tried to change was the fallout of the Soviet collapse. He had achieved some success with that in my original timeline. Sean had told me that I had been less successful in the last timeline. Maybe, just maybe, this opportunity here with Verakov could be translated into better success down the road. “Not even the United States is perfect.” Davey admitted with a shrug of his own and Verakov nodded. “Too many people are too blinded by their patriotism to see the need for improvement in their own system of government.” Verakov stated flatly. “Maybe they fear being arrested here.” I added in as a jibe and Verakov frowned at me. “For some that is a concern, but not for those who belong to the Party and seek to further the goals of the Party.” Verakov’s voice was flat as he spoke. “To look at the Party with a critical eye, seeking to improve the dialectic is the responsibility of all Party members. We are here.” “Amazing.” Davey said as we got out of the car and looked around at the Kremlin. We had been to Red Square when we first arrived, and seen the Tomb of Lenin with its long line of tourists, but to actually be in front of the working Kremlin, where the Soviet Union, and later the Russian Federation were governed was absolutely amazing. “Do you actually work here?” “No, my offices are nearby, not in the Kremlin itself.” Verakov said kindly. “Come, you have your papers?” “Da.” Davey said as he pulled the green passbook from his suit pocket. We were both wearing our best suits today. Davey’s passbook was new, something given to him just last week by Verakov. I had received a similar one. Neither were our American passports. These were documents that actually allowed us more freedom in Moscow than most of its own citizens enjoyed. A middle-aged officer looked them over carefully before allowing us entry into the building itself. Walking through the building was different than walking through the Capitol in Washington, or even the White House. Those buildings were full of history, and you knew they were the center of power for a mighty government, but the Kremlin had even more history, and at times like now, just as much power. It was more ostentatious, and in a way more humbling. We were led to a room deep in the Kremlin, where Verakov introduced us to Yuri Maslyukov, his ‘superior’. I recognized his name as the head of the State Planning Committee, and was surprised because I had been led to believe that Verakov worked for a different branch of the government. The State Planning Committee was responsible for implementing the long-range economic plans of the Soviet Union, and was one of their most important economic bodies. “They are waiting for the two of you.” Maslyukov stated after polite words had been exchanged, and Verakov led Davey into another room while I remained, as it was clearly intended with Maslyukov. When they were gone, the man turned to me, looking me over twice before speaking again. “Walk with me.” “Yes, comrade.” I said with a slight nod as he led the way out of the room and back down the hallway of the Kremlin. “In that room, a doctor and an official from the Foreign Office are telling your friend and mine that the young man is indeed the lost twin son.” Maslyukov said in Russian after we had turned a corner. He stopped walking and gave me a very direct look. “It is of course, a lie.” “Excuse me?” I exclaimed in English and he nodded before starting to walk again. I had to hurry a few steps to catch up. “Why are they telling them this if it is a lie?” “Mika has worked hard for the Rodina all of his life.” Maslyukov stated in a matter-of-fact tone. “The Rodina likes to repay those who serve it, and the last few years have not been kind to him. For the last year, his work has not been as it should, and I was considering replacing him. It was only a few months ago that I took this position, and we have important work to accomplish. I need him, his knowledge, and his skills, but only if he is able to work hard. Your… friend has given new life to him. Mika believes the boy is his son, and his work the last few weeks has never been better.” “Then why are you telling me the truth?” I asked him with incredulity. So the CIA hadn’t been able to fake the test. But… how did they get this result? Or did they just expect it to happen and hope for the best? My incredulity was real right now. “You are both very smart young men.” Maslyukov began his explanation with a compliment. “The fact that the two of you are perverts would normally be a barrier, but in this case we will overlook this fact.” “Why?” I asked directly and got a direct answer. “Mika, with his new son at hand, will do valuable work for several more years before he retires.” Maslyukov’s answer was simple. “When he retires, you can tell your friend the truth, and the two of you can return to your country, or stay. If you stay, honorable work will be found for the both of you, and as long as you do not make your perversion public, we will overlook it and not punish you as the law requires. In staying, at least until Mika retires, you will live comfortably and have the gratitude of the Soviet people.” “Aren’t you worried we might be spies?” I asked him, just to see his response. “Nyet.” He snorted in the negative. “You are too young, although we do know you wished to work for the CIA but were rejected. Mika has already told you we know this.” “I don’t want to give up my American citizenship.” I stated flatly. “I do not think Davey will either. I do know I will want to be able to visit my family from time to time.” “All that is being arranged.” Malsyukov stated. “You will both be granted diplomatic passports. The American State Department does not wish an international incident, although they deny any switch in babies was ever made.” “They’re right.” I reminded him and he chuckled. “But we will never tell them that.” He replied. “Sergei Mikhailovich, as your friend is being told his real name should be, will be granted Soviet citizenship. You will be a legal resident of the Soviet Union. Tomorrow you will visit the American Ambassador and tell him that these arrangements are acceptable to you. Both of you will be granted visas to return to the United States for a few weeks each year, and naturally any foreign vacations you take with Mika will be permitted. When Mika is retired, you will tell your friend, but not before! Then you may decide whether to stay, or leave forever.” “Why are you doing this?” I asked him sharply, and with a deliberately suspicious tone. “You believe the Soviet Union is this gigantic creature that does not care about its people.” Maslyukov stated flatly. “You are wrong. You Americans claim your government, what is the phrase? Oh yes, ‘Of the people, by the people, for the people’ but it is not the people your government serves, it is your economy. We run our economy so that it serves the needs of our people, not some corporations or a select few. Spend the next few years learning the true Soviet Union, not the villain your propaganda has shown you. We truly care for our people, and Mika has served us long and faithfully. In some ways, we have failed him. Our doctors failed to cure his wife of cancer, but then even your doctors often fail with that. Americans die all the time in accidents like that which took the life of Dmitry Mikhailovich. The difference is that we will give him something to replace those losses.” “By lying to him.” I stated and he chuckled again. I realized that we were essentially walking in a big circle as we passed the doorway that led to the room where Davey was right now. “Some lies are not wrong.” Malsyukov shrugged. “Some lies can do more good than harm. Do you not lie to your parents about your relationship with Sergei Mikhailovich?” “My parents know.” I said with a shrug. “His do not.” It was a statement, not a question. Yes, Davey had told Verakov that. “No, they don’t.” I stated. “Why not?” Maslyukov asked. “They wouldn’t understand it.” I said sourly. “So for you two, telling the lie to them is okay?” He asked with another chuckle. “When is a lie acceptable to you and when is it not?” “We’ll be lying to them when we tell them this story is true.” I stated and he nodded. “It will hurt them a lot.” “Will they not hurt when they learn their son will never give them grandchildren?” Maslyukov retaliated, and I had to smile at his persistence. He was right of course. Everyone lied, and we always believed our reasons for lying were valid, even necessary. “I am not Russian, or Soviet, or Communist.” I said with a shrug. “Why should I care to help you maintain your form of government?” “Ah, a real question at last.” Malsyukov said. “We will give you and your friend a comfortable life, more comfortable than you would have in the United States even.” “I don’t care about that.” I said with a shake of my head. “You are not interested in money?” He asked with a raised eyebrow. “Are you sure you are American?” “We can have all that in the United States.” I answered. “Then what if I were to tell you that you and Sergei Mikhailovich have broken Soviet law?” He said in a sterner voice. “You can be sent to the gulag for five years for the things you have done in the bedroom of Mika’s dacha. Not even your State Department would seek to stop such a sentence.” “You will lose Verakov’s services if you do that.” I retorted. “We will lose him anyway, to depression, if you do not cooperate.” He countered. That should be enough protesting to make it look real. “Okay.” I said after meeting his stare for several minutes. “As I said before, you are a smart young man.” Malsyukov said more jovially, clapping me on the shoulder. “Now, why don’t you join your friend and his father? Remember, he must believe what he has been told.” “I won’t tell him the truth, not until Verakov retires.” I said firmly and the man nodded once before opening the door for me. Davey was sitting in the room, in a chair next to Verakov, but smiled and leapt to his feet when he saw me. “Brian, it’s true!” He said in a tone of disbelief, but there was a smile on his face. “Can you believe it?” “I don’t know what to believe.” I answered in Russian. “This sounds like some story out of a Tom Clancy novel.” “Pravda.” Davey agreed with a chuckle. Verakov also stood and turned to face me. “Let me introduce you to my son, Sergei Mikhailovich.” Verakov said with a hand on Davey’s shoulder. “That is the name we would have given him if he had come to us, as he should have, eighteen years ago.” “I understand.” I said calmly. “What happens now?” “I don’t know.” Davey said with a frown. “How am I going to tell Mom and Dad? And Jenny? Do we stay here?” “I would like to get to know my son, if you are willing.” Verakov said firmly. “Both of you will always be welcome in my home.” “The Soviet Union will welcome one of its own sons home, and his friend.” The older man who was in the room said gravely. “I am Yuri Andreiich Nerov, from Foreign Affairs. We have already spoken with the American State Department. I believe you have been told of the agreements made, if this remains quiet and out of the Western media?” “Yes.” I agreed. “What do you think, Brian?” Davey asked me in English. “He says we can attend Moscow State for our degrees, if we wish. We’ll even have an apartment near campus, together! They will honor our credits from Arizona State.” “I’ll do whatever you want.” I said simply. “You should get to know him better if he really is your father.” “I think… it’s not like we won’t be able to go back.” Davey said. “I just don’t look forward to telling Mom and Dad.” “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” I replied in English and he nodded. “Come, this calls for a celebration.” Nerov said as he walked over to a low credenza with several bottles on it. He poured Vodka of course, and we all toasted father and son. Two nights later we were at the U.S. Embassy in a rather uncomfortable situation. At first two mid-level State Department officials grilled us over and over again on what was really going on, and on our decision to stay in the USSR. Then the ambassador himself got us alone in his office and pulled out the big guns. The long-distance telephone call to Davey’s parents, and then my parents, was anything but comfortable. They wanted us home, especially Davey’s parents who didn’t understand why he wouldn’t believe that they knew he was their son. This whole situation was stressful to them, and Davey knew through our secret tapping system that the test results were really a lie. Fooling his parents wasn’t easy, and it was only the promise of a visit over Christmas that kept them from going to the media immediately. Verakov took us to the Black Sea resort that was the favorite of members of the Politburo and their senior staff. Whatever his humble beginnings, Uncle Mikhail, as he insisted I call him, was one of the elite of Soviet society now, and lived a fairly comfortable life. Even while relaxing on the beaches of the Black Sea, though, he was working and Davey and I learned a lot about his work just from overheard conversations. We learned even more from the philosophical conversations that Davey had with the man while we settled into life in his dacha. The man was intent on convincing Davey that communism was the right way to govern a society, and Davey was proving a capable debater. He deftly steered their discussions into areas where the man actually revealed quite a bit about economic production in the Soviet Union, and the problems they faced. Occasionally I would get involved in the conversations, but I tended to give ground easier than Davey did. When classes began again at Moscow State, we were enrolled the same as any other students, or at least any other students of the elite. The required courses on Marxism-Leninism were non-negotiable, as were the math requirements harsher than their American counterparts. Davey was chagrined to learn he would be taking more math than he would have at Arizona State. Then there was the fact that everyone now called him Sergei. Even I called him by that name, only using his real name when we were having sex. It took him two weeks into the semester until he answered to it as he would to his real name. My name was also ‘russianized’, with people taking to calling me Yuri for some reason. I never quite got the connection, but Davey insisted that if he had to go by Sergei, I would answer to Yuri. When December rolled around, we learned just how cold a Russian winter could be. Both of us were happy to get on the Aeroflot flight that would eventually take us back to California. It was a long flight, with a stopover in Japan before we landed in San Francisco where both of our parents met us. His folks whisked him away with barely a word for me, while my mother kept on touching me to make sure I was really there. “What is really going on, Brian?” Dad asked when we were in the car and driving back towards Modesto. Davey had called, and written his parents every week, just as I had done, and their responses had become more and more distressful as time went by. Mikhail Verakov had not been happy to let us go, but seemed confident we would return. “You were told about Davey’s birth.” I answered in English that was actually a bit rusty. “Don’t tell me you believe that story?” Mom snorted. “Does it matter if we do or not?” I asked. “The Russians do, and Verakov believes it. You know how bad the story would make our government look if it ever got out. It’s just easier to let things happen this way. It’s not like they’re going to make Davey live there forever.” “What do you mean?” Dad asked. “And that’s Davey. Why are you staying?” “Would you leave Mom?” I asked him with a snort and he shook his head. “As for what I mean, well, when Davey and I graduate from college, things will change. Verakov will have gotten to know Davey for a few years, and he’ll be less… needy is the word I think. He’s just asked Davey for a few years to get to know him. He’s lost all his family you know.” “That doesn’t mean he has a right to take other people’s family.” Mom said sternly. I could only imagine what Davey was getting. “Well, both you and Davey have appointments with psychologists who specialize in dealing with Stockholm Syndrome. We’ll get you set right.” “You think we were taken hostage?” I asked, surprised by my own parents. “What other explanation is there?” Mom said and I laughed. This was going to be fun. In the end, it was Trevor’s father who took both parents aside for several long conversations. When he was done with them, our parents gave us dirty looks, but didn’t protest when we packed our bags to return to Moscow. Davey’s parents were downright frosty to both of us, not even taking him to the airport. It was on the flight back I learned that they finally knew exactly what our relationship was, and they’d threatened him with being disowned if he didn’t dump me. Then they blamed my parents for the whole mess, and I wasn’t sure how that was going to affect the business they all operated as a group. Mika was happy to see Davey when we landed in Moscow. It was even colder than it had been when we left. Oddly, Davey looked more comfortable here than he had the entire time in California. This whole thing was going to take years to smooth over when everything was done. I’d left nearly two hundred pages of hastily typed notes for Mr. Rush before we left, and I hoped whatever information was in there was worth the cost Davey, and to a less extent, I, would be paying for this – emotional as well as physical. Twice over the next year, I met Alexei Shevardnadze. It was eerie standing in the same room with the person who had caused so much trouble in previous timelines. The scientist was dead, though, and there was no need to kill the Russian this time. Still, it was interesting to know that I could have done it if it was necessary. As 1989 progressed, the discussions between Mika and Davey became less and less frequent. If you read Pravda, or watched the government news, you might not know that Hungary and Poland had elected non-communist governments. Nor would you truly understand that the Berlin Wall no longer existed. Still, news of those events percolated on the campus of Moscow State, and on the streets of the city itself. Knowing what was coming, and seeing the effects of those events on the populace was interesting. The signs were everywhere of the cracks in the foundations of the Soviet Union if you knew what to look for, but its leadership went along like nothing had changed. That year I went home for two weeks in the summer, and had several long talks with Mr. Rush, as well as leaving him a two-hundred page book on everything Davey and I were observing. In those notes were predictions that within the next few years, major changes would be seen in Soviet government. They didn’t come right out and say the Soviet Union was going to crack like an egg, but they hinted at it. That summer, we went to Samarra with Mika, and Davey got to meet several ‘cousins’ that still lived in the region. It was a closed region, where few if any Westerners had ever visited, and when I went back for Christmas, again alone, Mr. Rush seemed quite enthralled with my notes from the visit there. 1990 was going to be a long year for the Soviet Union, and I had front-row seats with Davey for the excitement. The 1988 reforms of Gorbachev, allowing for the first time since 1922 private property, private ownership of business and manufacturing plants were starting to have their effect on the national economy. Mika was at the heart of the storm, and while we stayed in the Moscow apartment that had been provided, we barely saw him during the week. On the weekends he looked like he was aging every week, growing older and older. Davey took to worrying over his health more than anything else. One thing I’d always underestimated was the news programs. As time went by, the reforms of Gorbachev relaxed the Communist party control over the media. For the first time, the Soviet people were learning some of the sordid history of their nation. From Stalin’s purges to the abysmally high suicide rate, information that had been kept from them was becoming public, and shaking the faith of the average citizen on the street. Since the early days of the cold war, the United States had tried telling Soviet citizens about these atrocities and problems, but their broadcasts reached few people inside the nation, and were believed by even fewer. Several of those we met who were near our age group could sing every song by American (and British) rock bands that they heard over the pirate American broadcasts, but would laugh about stories of Stalin’s atrocities, until they heard about it on Moscow news. By the time we were ready to graduate with our degrees from Moscow State, I was quite certain that I wanted to stay and watch this all the way through. It was still winter outside, and there was a lot of snow on the ground when we went to a dinner at Mika’s house. Maslyukov was there, with his wife, as were several other apparatchiks who worked with the two men. It was a semi-formal affair, but the discussion took a surprising turn after the dinner itself was over, and we sat in a room sipping cognac in front of the fire. “Do you know what our work is right now?” Maslyukov asked Davey and I after taking a puff on his cigarette. So far Davey and I had both resisted taking up smoking, which all these men did with relish. “I have a few thoughts.” Davey admitted. “There is much privatization of businesses going on now and you play some role in that.” “We are supposed to be supporting the private ownership of business and manufacturing while still maintaining control.” Maslyukov stated sourly. “It does not go well. Production is still down, and our economy worsens instead of improves.” “Maybe you have the wrong people buying the businesses.” Davey said quickly, hitting a key point I’d shared with him about the problems of post-Soviet Russia. “What do you mean?” Maslyukov asked. “Who is buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “Those with the resources to do so, Sergei.” Mika stated with a chuckle. “You know this already, or should.” “Yes, but why are they buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “What is their motivation for owning them?” “To make money.” Maslyukov, a true communist said it with a frown. “That is the problem. They do not care about the good of the nation, they care first about making more money.” “That is always the problem with capitalism, but it does work.” Davey said. “The problem is not just with production, it’s with distribution, which is still state-controlled, and it is with the ownership. Here in Moscow, the small restaurants and other types of businesses that are opening are flourishing. That is because they can buy the goods they need to sell, and because they live here. They care about not only making a profit, but doing right by their neighbors who are their customers. A person in Moscow who buys a factory in Samarra does not care about the people in Samarra. He cares about his factory making money.” “So how do you solve this?” Maslyukov asked with real interest. “No one in Samarra has money to buy the factory.” “No one.” Davey said with emphasis on the second word. “Establish a fund to help the workers in the factory take out a loan and collectively buy the factory. If the workers of the factory own it, depend on it for their lives, and receive back the fruits of their labor from dividend payments, they will work harder. They will vote to hire managers that know what they are doing, and get rid of those who do not.” “But that does not solve the transportation problems.” I added. “What good does it do to make more automobiles if you cannot move them to where people can afford to buy them?” “How would you improve our transportation, my young man American friend?” Maslyukov asked. Should I reply honestly, and take the risk of actually helping the Soviet Union? No, the suggestion would only speed up its end, or be a contributing factor to that end. “Much the same way as what Sergei suggested.” I explained. “Truck drivers do not care if they arrive on time if they are not being rewarded for their work. Enable them to achieve their own control over their own work. Establish a fund that will loan them the money to buy their own trucks. You won’t really be spending any more money than you already did to buy the truck the first time. You are just moving money around on paper. Charge them a little interest. They will own the truck, and be able to offer their services to those who have goods to move at a fair price. Monitor their prices, and those that cheat too much can be punished. In English we call it ‘gouging’. “But there isn’t really infrastructure to support all that.” Davey said with a sigh. “The roads are awful, and fueling stations are not all that common. They would have to be privatized too in order to make this work.” “That is the problem.” I agreed with him. “You cannot just turn one part of the economy into private business without also converting those that support such businesses. A puzzle is only little pieces until you put them all together to form a whole.” “Yes, it is as you have said, Mika.” Maslyukov said. “Looking at only one tree has blinded us to the whole forest.” “It is something we should think about.” Mika added, and the conversation changed to the weather and when we thought spring would finally arrive. By summer, Davey and I found ourselves in positions I had not expected: working as assistants to Mika. Certainly we were very junior, and watched very, very closely, but we found some of our suggestions actually being considered, and one or two implemented. I was certain they would not help strengthen the Soviet Union, but held my breath just the same. That summer Davey did not go back to America at all. His family was still not speaking to him, and my parents explained that David Jones Sr. had quit working for their budding corporation, even though he still owned a fair amount of stock. It wasn’t quite clear what he was doing, but he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. Mr. Rush was not alone when I went to visit him this time. Mr. Long was there as well, and I had a direct debriefing that summer that lasted almost all of the two weeks. I barely had time to spend a day with Trevor and Todd as well as Brandon and Sean, all of whom were busy with their own lives. Todd was working on movie sets, trying to become a director. Trevor was drafted by L.A. and playing professional football as a backup quarterback. Brandon and Sean were starting up their own computer firm and had settled in Massachusetts. Before I returned, there was one more meeting with Mr. Long, who told me to keep doing what we were doing. There were several people at the CIA who now believed it was entirely possible the Soviet Union could collapse any day now, and they were looking forward to seeing it become reality. He was even more excited about our new jobs, and was considering setting up a system whereby we could sneak information out more frequently. Davey was happy to see me when I returned, and he had a very worried look on his face as he met me at Moscow’s airport. “What’s wrong?” I asked him, switching back to Russian easily now. “It’s father.” Davey said with a frown as we walked to the waiting car. He had started calling Mika that last year. Never any shorter name, always ‘father’. “What is it?” I asked him. “He is in the hospital.” Davey said sadly. “The doctors say it is only a matter of time.” “I’m sorry.” I said as we got in the car. “Are we going to see him?” “Yes, he’s been asking for you.” Davey said with a slight smile. “He misses his ‘third’ son.” “I missed him too.” I said, and was only partly surprised at the truth of that statement. Chapter 26 We buried Mikhail Verakov twelve days after I returned to Moscow. Like so many other Russian men, he died from lung cancer and pneumonia. Over the last few years, I had seen the close bond that had developed between Davey and this man, and so I wasn’t surprised at how hard Davey took the man’s death. Mika was not Davey’s real father, and Davey knew that, but he loved the man anyway for a variety of reasons. Part of it had to do with the unconditional love that Mika had always given him. Even at its best, Davey’s relationships with his parents had always been conditioned by a variety of factors. They had certain expectations of him in every timeline, and he was constantly struggling with them in one way or another, even when they accepted him, and our relationship. He had to prove to them that he wasn’t a disappointment even though he was gay. With Mika, there had been none of that. The old man had accepted Davey, or Sergei as he’d always called Davey, as Davey was, without condition. Davey did not have to do anything to please the man, or to be loved by the man. All he had to do was be there. It was certainly a far easier relationship for Davey. Davey spoke at the funeral, which was attended by a lot more people than we had expected. It wasn’t a religious service of course, and many of the people were dignitaries of the Soviet government. After the funeral, we even spoke a few words with the Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev. That was quite an eye-opening experience for both of us since we had rarely even seen the man before and certainly never spoken to him directly. Davey and I didn’t speak about the future after the funeral, but rather I comforted him while he cried. I’d been there with him in my original timeline after his parents had each passed away, and knew he took these types of situations very hard. The future could wait while he grieved. We spent that night at Mika’s dacha out in the foothills instead of at our apartment. There, on the mantle over the fireplace, new pictures had been added in recent years, pictures of Mika and Davey, and even a few of me up there as well. In all of them, Mika’s lips were curled upwards. “You have a visitor, Sergei.” Lina, Mika’s older housekeeper said on the morning of the third day. Mika’s driver was no longer around, but she was still here, taking care of the house and helping to fix our meals while we stayed. She was a widower, and her children were grown and had families of their own now. Her work here had been a semi-retirement for her, and I idly wondered what would happen for her now. For that matter, what would happen with this house? “Who is it?” Davey asked in a soft voice. “Comrade Maslyukov is here.” She responded. “Please, bring him in.” Davey said quickly, turning from the picture on the fireplace and straightening his shirt. We were both wearing dark slacks, and Davey was in a white dress shirt while I was wearing a light green polo. Both of us straightened our hair a bit before heading down the stairs. “Comrade Maslyukov, welcome.” Davey said formally as we came into the living room. “Comrade Verakov, you have my condolences.” Maslyukov said with a short nod to Davey before he turned to me. “Comrade Breckenridge, you have honored our agreement over the last few years. I am here to honor my part now.” “You are referring to the fact that Comrade Verakov was not really my father.” Davey said calmly and Maslyukov shot me an accusing glare. “Please, Comrade, I knew from the beginning that he was not. Yuri did not have to tell me anything. I think in the end, even he knew that I was not his other son, but it did not matter. Family is more than blood, sometimes. Mika needed family, and he was a good man who deserved to have a family. I was honored to give him that.” “Interesting.” Maslyukov said as he sat down hard. Davey nodded and crossed to the small bar, pouring three shots of vodka and handing one to me before giving one to the older man. We toasted the memory of the departed and Maslyukov downed his quickly. “I liked him the first time I met him, and knew he was a good man.” Davey continued his explanation calmly. “He seemed so lonely, and did not deserve that. When I saw how he was able to accept me as I am, without judgment, I knew I would give him what he wanted: a son.” “This is a copy of his will.” Maslyukov said after he had digested Davey’s words. He took out a folded paper from his suit coat and handed it to Davey. “You will see that he has left you all of his possession. They are not as much as your American father has, but you can live comfortably in the USSR with this.” “Are we still welcome here?” Davey asked. “It is a fiction that I am a son of the Soviet Union.” “It is fiction, yes, but the records all say now that it is a fact.” Maslyukov shrugged. “If you wish to stay, if both of you wish to stay, you will be welcome. I am worried for the future.” “Why?” I asked, speaking for the first time in this conversation. Maslyukov held out the tumbler he had emptied, and waited while Davey filled it for him. The older man downed it again and looked out the large windows behind us and motioned for both Davey and I to sit. We did, sitting next to each other on the couch. “I fear the Union is crumbling.” Maslyukov’s voice was faint. When both Davey and I looked nervous he chuckled. “The listening devices were removed last year. Neither of you have said, or done, anything that our spies have disapproved. They were quite upset that you were not spies.” “There were no military secrets for us to steal.” Davey shrugged and Maslyukov chuckled again. “It is possible the American government has been looking in the wrong places for our secrets all these years.” Maslyukov stated in a sad tone. “I never thought to see the day when the Union would be crumbling. The Germans talk of reunification with the capitalist brothers. The European states talk of independence, and even the Baltic states are grumbling that they were once sovereign. I fear that only tanks and soldiers will keep them in the Union, and this is not the 1950’s. Gorbachev is not Kruschev, to crush them under his boots and force them to comply. As things stand now, the Union will not survive more than five years.” “I would give it two at most.” I said, taking a risk. Maslyukov gave me a hard look and then nodded abruptly. “That is a bet I will not take.” He grumbled. “You have proven to be quite intelligent, both of you.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Sergei, I fear for what comes.” Maslyukov stated. “I wonder what will happen to the Rodina if the Union dissolves. Will we become capitalists only concerned about making more rubles and discard our principles?” “That is a possibility.” Davey said with a frown. “Mika and I had many conversations about the dangers of unfettered capitalism. I do not agree with communism, I believe you know that.” “Yes.” Maslyukov agreed. “Mika said you might make a socialist, but never a communist.” “True.” Davey agreed bluntly. “Even socialism though, does not work, in my belief. It is more accurate to say I believe in controlled capitalism. A field where any man may achieve his dreams, but all have the chance to play the game.” “Yes, Mika told me of this.” Maslyukov said with a shake of his head. “That is why I would ask you two to stay. You will never rise to a position like mine, or even that of Mika, but I would listen to your ideas as we struggle to keep the Union alive. Can you stomach that, even though you were born American?” “What if the Union does not survive?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow. “What then?” “Then, you will help build a new Rodina.” Maslyukov said with a shrug. Before coming to Moscow, I’d have never expected to hear a Russian say something like this. Davey and I hadn’t spoken about the future, but he obviously had been thinking about it, and reached some decisions. I knew him, and could reason out what his thinking might be without having to talk it out. He knew I was always worried about the days after the fall of the Soviet Union. As Sean had said, my plans for trying to help from the outside had failed. Maybe working from the inside would see a different result. The long range plans would be affected of course, but they had been centered on more than just the United States. They were not about setting up a third political party in the United States, or getting any one individual elected. No, the plans were about changing how people looked at the world, and about the role of government and the individual. It was about taking responsibility for ourselves as individuals, and as a society. “I am willing to stay.” I said after we had all remained silent for a long time. Davey nodded, and Maslyukov nodded. “Then I will see the two of you in my office next Monday.” Maslyukov as he stood up and prepared to leave. “We have much work to do.” He wasn’t lying, either. There was a lot of work to do. Over the next few weeks, and months, we butted head with several different factors. First of course, was that this was still the Soviet Union, and its bureaucracy was filled with loyal communists. Gorbachev said he wanted private ownership, but those who had to implement such things considered private ownership anathema. Then there was corruption. Corruption had always been a part of the bureaucracy. To one extent or another, it was always a factor no matter the form of government. That was why, in the United States, anti-corruption laws were so important. One of the reasons America’s form of government worked was because corruption was limited, kept under relative control. The fact that every year there was at least one corrupt lawmaker getting caught was a testament to how well the system worked, not necessarily to its failure. Failure was when corruption happened and was never caught. In the more authoritarian USSR, corruption was far more rampant. Those in authority had more power, and in many cases investigators were either hamstrung in their ability to root it out, or had no interest. Blatant corruption of course was dealt with, and every so often the government would trot out an excessively corrupt bureaucrat as an example, but few of those in power feared being hauled off to prison. The changing rules on property and business ownership meant that more and more people were seeing opportunities to make a quick ruble, and many of them lacked any sense of ethics. We were still outsiders for the most part, and while they called us ‘Sergei’ and ‘Yuri’, and we all spoke mostly Russian, those we worked with and for rarely forgot that we were not really Russian. It was a barrier for us, but not an insurmountable one. Davey’s relationship with his family back in the States continued unchanged. They didn’t speak to him, and he didn’t speak to them. My parents told me that Mr. Jones had patched up his relationship with them, and gone back to work at the company that Dad still ran. When I visited them towards the end of Spring, they questioned me intently on why I was staying in the USSR. At Mr. Rush’s house, Mr. Long was waiting expectantly for me. I had another long series of reports for him, and he was most interested in hearing about Maslyukov’s statement regarding the USSR crumbling. He explained how he was filtering our reports through several different channels, making it almost impossible to track down where they came from, which was a good thing because I knew of at least one spy that was operating within the CIA at this time. I could have warned him about that person, but I had not come up with a way to explain how I knew about that person, while not creating the expectation that I would know of other things. Davey and I continued a comfortable existence in Moscow by and large. Occasionally, some woman from work would express an interest in one of us, but would look somewhere else when we showed no interest. At night, we would occasionally go out with groups of co-workers, or Russian friends from University. Both of us enjoyed the many theaters in Moscow. Not the movie theaters, but the stage plays, ballets, and even the opera, although Davey didn’t like operas nearly as much as I did. Back in March of 1990, Gorbachev had sent tanks into Lithuania to prop up the communist government. Later in that same year, Latvia and Estonia began the process of declaring their independence, and the tanks did not roll in to stop them. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, we watched along with the rest of the world as the United States rallied together an impressive coalition to throw Iraq out of that small country. When the battle began in early 1991, our friends in Moscow reacted with shock at the total collapse of Saddam’s largely Soviet-supplied and trained military. While the world was occupied watching what was happening in the Middle East, the KGB and Soviet Army troops again took to the streets in Lithuania. Their nationalist media was going further than the other states in pushing for independence. Maslyukov remained tight-lipped about the meetings of the Central Committee, but we could tell they were growing more and more intense and fractured. There were days that Davey and I held our breaths, or had to bite our tongues to keep from revealing too much knowledge of what was right around the corner. While US troops mopped up operations in Iraq and Kuwait, the Soviet Union voted. Davey was technically a citizen, and actually got to take part in the vote. It was in March of 1991 that nearly eighty percent of Soviet citizens voted to keep the Soviet Union, albeit in a reformed manner. Most of the ‘breakaway’ states didn’t want to lose access to the larger Russian markets that full independence would bring. What they wanted was less central-control from Moscow, and more local control. Maslyukov breathed a sigh of relief that his Soviet Union had passed a major crisis and survived. I didn’t tell him what was right around the corner. Boris Yeltsin was running for the office of President of the Russian SFSR against Nikolai Ryzhkov. Mikhail Gorbachev was supporting Ryzhkov, but we both knew it was Yeltsin that would win, and in a few months stand up to the tanks of the Soviet Union. Davey and I, still using our system of tapping out messages just in case there was someone listening, discussed whether we should get involved in the campaign or not. In the end we went to Maslyukov with the matter. “Why do you want to support Yeltsin?” Maslyukov asked. Just a few years ago, elections like these, where you had several different candidates, and only one of them a member of the Communist Party would not have been possible. “I believe he will win.” Davey answered. “Yes, but why do you want to support him?” Maslyukov pushed and Davey looked at him with a confused expression for a moment. “This is not America, Sergei. Supporting the wrong candidate here is much more dangerous, especially for one who works for the Soviet Union. No, don’t get that look on your face my young friend. This is no longer the old Soviet Union. Lefortovo will not be graced with your presence just for supporting Yeltsin. Still, I might be told that your work is no longer needed here, and I will find it hard to disagree.” “We will miss working for you, comrade.” Davey said quietly, but firmly. “There are other jobs in Moscow, though.” “Especially if you helped with the right campaign.” Maslyukov nodded and then he sighed. “We will have to keep in contact.” “Of course.” Davey said with a smile. With that we left the office, and returned to work for the afternoon. That night we went home to the large townhouse that we had purchased, partly with money from Davey’s inheritance, and partly through selling some of the stocks we had received via our parents. It was one of those old eighteenth-century homes, with huge rooms, carved borders, and tall, narrow doors. Lina had dinner ready, as usual, when we got home. She had accepted our offer to live with us after Mika had died. She was now retired, receiving her pension from the state, but stayed with us for free, as well as received a small stipend to supplement her income. In return, she cooked dinner for us, and did most of the basic cleaning. Here she was close enough to her adult children that she could visit them, and her grandchildren nearly every day. It was a good arrangement that worked for all of us. The timeline was moving along so smoothly, heading straight in the direction that we expected, and even I had to admit that being where we were, at the center of change in Russia and the collapse of the Soviet Union was a breathtaking experience. Moscow was flooded with more foreigners than ever before, many of them ‘consultants’ brought in to help with the reforms of Gorbachev. It was amusing watching them struggle with the Soviet bureaucrats, so stuck in their ways, and yet knowing that change was on the horizon. Davey and I were both welcomed into the Yeltsin camp with open arms and many shots of vodka. Both of us were quite surprised that on our first day we got to sit down with Boris Yeltsin himself for nearly thirty minutes, talking about his vision of the future. Neither of us was surprised by his continued dedication to communism. The collapse of communism was by and large an accident of fate more than anything else. In order to understand how it happened, it is necessary to understand how the ordinary Russian perceived leadership. Maybe it was because of the repeated Mongol invasions, followed by Hitler’s greatest mistake of World War II where he invaded and devastated Russia before being thrown back, but the average Russian prefers strong leadership. Ideas and concepts such as communism or democracy, or feeding the poor, or even justice often take a second seat in who a Russian will support compared to the ‘strength’ of the candidate. Will the candidate be strong? Will they be able to lead Russia (or the Soviet Union) against all enemies? This theory of Russian electioneering was originally something I’d learned from the first Davey I had met. However, it had been proven over several lifetimes. The Soviet Union collapsed, according to this theory, not because of a failure of communism so much as a failure of leadership. Gorbachev took a fatal blow in public opinion when his own deputies managed to seize control from him. His deputies who took over failed to garner enough support from the public, and from the military. Yeltsin was able to seize the initiative, and because both Gorbachev and the coup plotters were pro-communist, the only alternative was to do away with the crumbling system. The only winners in that showdown were Yeltsin and his supporters, and Yeltsin won because he was seen showing strength and being victorious. Years later, when Putin took the reins of power from an ailing Yeltsin, it was his strength that allowed him to stay in power long after he should have left the position. His strength gave his viewpoints an air of legitimacy, and so he stayed in power. No one could muster the appearance of strength for many years in order to challenge him. Working on the election was an invigorating experience for both of us. It was different from American elections, but at the same time there were some core fundamentals that were unchanged. Controlling the message of the campaign was just as important, if not more important in these elections, and that was where I found my niche in working with Yeltsin’s senior advisors. Davey’s gift for writing found him working with the speechwriters for Yeltsin’s addresses, and after his victory (which was unsurprising for us), we found ourselves in middle-level positions of the administration of the Russian state government. It wasn’t too difficult for us to obtain visas for our friends to come out and visit us the week before the coup we expected to happen. Trevor was the most difficult to arrange, mostly because his parents were defectors, but even he was able to obtain a visa in this age of perestroika. They arrived on a British Airways flight in Moscow’s main airport, and Davey and I were there to meet them. The changes in our friends over the past several years were shocking to us in many ways. We had kept in touch by letters, and the occasional phone call, but seeing them after all these years was different. Trevor’s brown hair was cut short, and he was in great physical shape. Todd’s hair was longer, and paler red than it had been years ago. Brandon’s hair was longer, nearly touching his shoulders, and he was slimmer than I had expected. Sean’s hair was darker, and his freckles had started to fade, but he was actually more built up than Brandon. “Look at you two.” Trevor said with a smile after we had all hugged in the middle of the airport’s concourse after they had passed through customs without too much trouble. “What?” Davey asked in English. “You look… Russian.” Trevor said, also in English. He alone of our friends had any fluency in Russian. “We have been here for a few years.” I replied with a slight smile, and found it odd to be speaking English after using Russian almost exclusively all these years. Actually, I’d used English on my visits home, but speaking it here, in Moscow, felt truly odd. “Let’s get out of here.” “You’re going to love our house.” Davey promised them as we made our way out and found two taxis that would take us to the house. Davey rode in a car with Trevor and Todd while I went with Brandon and Sean in the other taxi. “Wow, it’s nicer than I thought.” Sean said as we drove down the road. “Moscow is very beautiful, especially in the summer.” I replied to his statement and heard a grunt from the driver. He was trying to take us the longer way to our destination and I spoke to him briefly in Russian. The driver frowned, but nodded and turned back to the shorter path. “Are we really going to the ballet tomorrow night?” Brandon asked with a slight grin on his face. “Yes.” I assured him. “That will be fun.” Sean agreed. The chatter continued like that, with no references to the real reason for their visit. I played the good tour guide, pointing out important historical sights along the way to the house, and when we reached it, I paid the driver off with a very slight tip since he’d tried to cheat us. “Can we talk freely here?” Trevor asked in English once we’d gotten inside the house and were all sitting in the living room. Lina was visiting her grandchildren today, and so we had the house to ourselves. “Yes.” Davey assured them. “Why’d you want us here?” Brandon asked with a frown. “Not that it’s not good to see you guys again. I mean, we haven’t gotten together at all in years, so why now?” “You know the coup is about to happen.” Davey said with a frown. “We thought you’d want to see it in person.” “Well, kind of.” Trevor shrugged. “But, what does this all have to do with our long-range plans? Why are you two here instead of in the U.S.?” “I think I overlooked something important in those plans.” I said with a sigh and looked up to see their expressions of surprise. “What would that be?” Sean asked with a little half-smile. “I’ve made the typical mistake of American hubris.” I said with a shrug. “In the planning, I looked at things too much from a solely American perspective, always at changing things from the outside, not the inside of other nations. Look, this has always been about changing the perspective of people so that they look at the world from a larger perspective. How do we think we can make that change from solely within the United States?” “So you’re going to try to make changes here in the Soviet Union?” Trevor asked in a tone of disbelief. “No, from the Russian Federation.” Davey countered. “The Soviet Union must end, that is obvious. History records its fate over and over again. It is an unsustainable system. What we’re going to do is try to cut down on the initial corruption and growth of the crime syndicates after the Soviet collapse. We’re in position now to do that, all we have to do is wait for the change in power to happen by the end of this year.” “What we’re going to need though is your help.” I added. “Here we have influence, and frankly we are well off enough that we can lead comfortable lives, but we won’t have the capital to really make some of the differences we need to make.” “How are things going on your end?” Davey asked them. “We’re good.” Trevor said with a smile at Todd, and the two of them clasped hands briefly. It was sweet to see their fondness for each other had not changed. “I’ve been picked up by the Rams, and I’ve already had the conversation with the coach. If the story breaks about us as a couple, they aren’t going to drop me. We don’t plan on breaking the story anytime soon, but it’s a good contract.” “I’ve got good news for you as well.” Todd said with a grin. “You might actually get to see some original movies for once without having to wait for the 21st Century. I’ve signed a good deal for a script I found, and if it works out, well, we’ll be well on the way to having a comfortable financial base between what I make and what Trevor makes.” “We’re doing damn good too.” Sean said firmly with a wink at Brandon. “None of us are going to have to turn to the lottery trick this time around, that’s for sure.” “So you’re wanting to take our hard-earned money, are you?” Brandon asked with mock severity. “We’re wanting you to invest it wisely.” Davey countered with a smile for Brandon. “It’s a perfect opportunity to get in on the ground floor.” “There’s more to the world than just Russia and the United States.” Trevor replied with a frown. “Yes, but maintaining the balance of two superpowers is important.” I countered. “Let’s face it, nature abhors a vacuum, and the unbridled supremacy of the United States during the 1990’s and early 21st Century is part of what got our homeland into so much trouble in those later years, during my original timeline. A stronger Russia on the international stage in the mid to late-1990’s and early 21st Century can make a huge difference, like it did in the 2020’s and 2030’s before the vacuum after Putin’s assassination.” “Do you really think you can accelerate Russian growth and domination so quickly?” Trevor asked with a frown. “It’s not a matter of accelerating its growth so much as it is stopping its decline.” Davey countered with a grin. “The 1990’s, under Yeltsin, was a time of massive decline, especially in the first five years. Yeltsin couldn’t be bothered to handle the little details, and those were what killed the Russian Federation. He cared only about the ‘big picture’, not all the little things that let the crime syndicates gain too much power, and slowed the economic growth of the country. Along with the associated corruption that was allowed to happen, well it was a mess in those early years.” “That is where Sergei and I will make the difference.” I added. “Sergei?” Brandon asked. “Who is Sergei?” “That’s my Russian name.” Davey shrugged and I blushed. Normally I didn’t slip up like that, but for some reason it was happening more and more lately. “Sorry.” I said with a blush. “Being here, now, gives you a reason for helping to invest in Russia’s economy in the near future.” Davey added. “Now will be the time that a little bit of money can make a huge difference, and Trevor, your public sports position will be helpful too, especially if your parent’s story comes out in public after the collapse.” “They won’t like that.” Trevor frowned. “No, but it will help.” Davey countered. “Part of the initial problem is that every bit of help the United States offers at this point in time comes with a price tag that the Russian government cannot pay. Instead of treating Russia like a potential partner, they try to treat this country like a defeated enemy, and that’s something on your end that needs to change.” “I’m just a sports figure.” Trevor countered. “Hell, right now I’m not even on the ‘A’ list of things.” “No, but you’re in the best position to get the press to look at you and to listen.” I countered and Trevor frowned. “You’re asking a lot, you know.” He said with resignation. “We know.” Davey assured him. “What about Shevardnadze?” Sean asked. “Any sign he did come back in time?” “None.” I answered quickly. “It appears the jamming of the frequency he and the scientist used did work, without affecting the frequency you used, or the one that we all used the last time.” “That’s good.” Sean said with a sigh. “He’d have been back for a few years by now.” “Yes.” Davey agreed. “Look, I know this isn’t easy for any of us, but remember, this is why we did come back. We need to make the world a better place, and the only way to do that is to make sure it stays balanced.” “I agree.” Todd said with a frown. “Part of me doesn’t like it, because it feels like we’re being disloyal to the United States, but you’re right. In the long run the best thing is for the United States to have competition in the international stage.” “The same goes for any country.” Davey said. “No matter what we do, the United States must remain strong and independent.” “We agree on that.” Sean said with a nod of his head. “Now that we’ve got that out of the way, how about showing us some of Moscow?” Trevor asked. “Have you two taken up smoking?” “No!” Davey nearly shouted. “But I bet you drink vodka.” Todd laughed. “Konyechna!” I said, slipping back into Russian without even thinking about it, and Davey translated for me with a laugh. He got up and brought a bottle of vodka along with several glasses, and we proceeded to teach our friends some of the best Russian toasts we had learned over the years. It was funny watching Todd and Sean stagger around, barely able to walk as we went to dinner at a nearby restaurant later than night. They were all tired from the flight, and the plan was for them to go to bed after they’d eaten. Trevor ordered for himself, but we translated for the others and after dinner everyone was asleep within minutes upon our return to the house. “I love you.” Davey whispered as he curled up against me and fell asleep. It felt surprising good to be surrounded by our friends, and the nervousness that had been growing in me over the last few weeks faded away. Knowing the coup was coming, and that the end result was going to be good for everyone was one thing, but I kept worrying that something could still happen to Davey and I, caught in the middle of the coup. Having our friends here made it seem a much more remote possibility. Chapter 27 They were angry, and yet at the same time they were happy. The crowds that surged around us were a veritable flux of emotions ranging from extreme anger to almost giddiness about the things going on around them. Certainly it was far more emotion than we had ever seen before from the normally stoic Muscovites. So far, everything was going pretty much as we had expected. Senior members of the Soviet leadership had arrested Mikhail Gorbachev and declared an emergency across the nation. Boris Yeltsin was leading popular protests here in Moscow that started out somewhat muted, but when the army failed to open fire, erupted into full-scale public outrage the likes of which Russia had not seen since 1917. Of course there were differences. Those differences included our presence among the senior staff advising Boris Yeltsin. Say what you will about the man, and historians have always had plenty to say about him, but Boris Yeltsin understood opportunity, politics, and the feelings of the average Russian citizen. He knew that no matter what happened, from this point on his political nemesis Mikhail Gorbachev was ruined as a leader. The Russian people didn't follow weak leaders. They admired strength, dedication, and would often overlook political ideology if the leaders were strong enough. Because of the coup, Mikhail Gorbachev would never be viewed as a strong leader. Boris Yeltsin, by standing up to the coup plotters, was granted an aura of strength that resonated with the general public, and they were listening to his calls for meaningful reforms. Davey, our friends, and I made only a few contributions to the events of those days. In the five minutes the two of us had alone with him in the first day of the coup, he listened to our passionate speech about dealing with corruption. We spent three of those five minutes doing our best to convince him corruption was a big enough problem that it must be dealt with quickly once the coup was ended. \"Do you have plans on how to do this?\" He asked us with a shrewd look when we were done. \"Da.\" Davey said firmly. We were seated in Yeltsin's office and had brought briefcases with us. My lover took a large folder out of his briefcase and put it on the Russian President's desk. Yeltsin frowned before picking up the file that was five inches thick, and leafed through the first set of handwritten pages barely skimming over the text. \"You have detailed plans.\" He said simply as he shut the file and handed it back to Davey who took it quickly. It was a good thing Yeltsin had not looked past the first fifteen handwritten pages, because most of the rest was just filler, used to make it look thicker. We had counted on his disinterest in details and the thickness was really meant to just impress him. \"Give me a one-page paper with talking points.\" \"Will these do?\" Davey asked, pulling another piece of paper out of his briefcase and handing it to the President. Yeltsin looked over the handwritten paper quickly and then nodded. \"You come prepared.\" He stated gruffly. \"We believe this is a very important issue.\" I said firmly and he nodded again. \"Many of my closest advisors will not be happy with this.\" He stated. \"In the interest of moving forward into a new era, it might be good to offer a general amnesty for past wrongs.\" Davey suggested with a shrug. \"Include Black Marketers and others in the amnesty.\" I added. \"We can use their skills. They are able to move goods past the borders, under the noses of security while we cannot move goods from farms or factories to the markets on the legal roads.\" \"You two will organize this.\" He said firmly, giving us everything we had hoped for, and more. \"I will see you outside.\" \"Thank you, Mr. President.\" Davey said as we stood and left the room. The other contribution that we made came on the day Boris Yeltsin stood on the tank in Red Square. There were tears in my eyes, and the eyes of our friends who stood with us, near Yeltsin himself as he climbed on the tank. Here was history being made, and we hoped that with only slight changes it would truly make the world a better place. In the last timeline, our children had never really understood the concept of the Soviet Union and the threat that it posed to the world. They grew up in a world where the Soviet system of government had been thrown on the trash pile of history. For those of us in the previous generation, and the generation before that, we understood the danger represented by the Soviets. It was about more than just nuclear weapons being pointed at each other, and global games of brinkmanship. For as long as there had been countries and governments, such games were played. The dangers of the Soviet era were about more than just geopolitics. It represented a philosophy, an outlook on life that was antithetical to all the principles most Americans held dear. At its core, communism eliminated the ability to make a better life for yourself through your choices and actions. Yes, you were allowed some choices, but it regulated your choices, and your rewards for excellence. It eliminated the rewards inimical in doing a job to the best of your abilities. Whether you were a doctor, a factory worker, or a farm worker, it left you in the same situation. What motivation was there for a person to excel in their field? Further, it required a strict adherence to the communist philosophy. Those who dissented, or believed otherwise where shunted aside, and not given the opportunities of others who at least mouthed loyalty to the communist party. That was one reason for the inherit corruption that existed in the Soviet government. \"This is absolutely amazing.\" Todd whispered in English as we watched Yeltsin berate the troops for supporting the corrupt coup plotters. Around us the crowd surged again, and I smiled at Davey, wanting to hold his hand, but knowing better than to make such a public display of affection. His smile told me everything I needed to know, although when it turned into a frown, I began to grow worried until I noticed he was looking over my shoulder. \"What is it?\" I asked in English and he shook his head, his eyes scanning the buildings behind me. When he turned, I was surprised by his actions and started to turn and look in the direction he'd been looking, but was distracted by him running towards the tank. Davey leaped into the air, tackling Yeltsin and pulling him to the ground. For a wild moment, I thought he'd gone crazy, but I'd caught the flash of something hitting the tank, and heard the grunt from Brandon. \"Sniper!\" Davey yelled in Russian as he covered Yeltsin's body with his own while the President's security people swarmed the two of them. Sean was trying to hold up the much taller Brandon, and Todd, Trevor and I rushed over to them. Brandon was bleeding from his left shoulder, and I figured out what had happened quickly. Davey had seen the flash of a scoped rifle in the buildings behind us, figured out there was a sniper there, and acted, figuring the target was Boris Yeltsin. The bullet had ricochet off the tank, and hit Brandon. Fortunately, the wound wasn't bad, and appeared to have missed anything vital. Around us, the crowd went wild as they realized someone had just tried to shoot Yeltsin. What had been a relatively peaceful demonstration turned into a full-scale riot, and the soldiers as well as the policemen who had been standing by were suddenly fighting for their lives against the angry civilians. Somewhere another shot rang out, and then another. \"We've got to get out of here.\" I said as we were jostled by the crowd that was swaying in every direction. Trevor nodded, picking Brandon up and putting him into a fireman's carry as the rest of us tried to clear a path. Yeltsin, and Davey, were already being hustled out of the area by security people loyal to Yeltsin, and we were left to fend for ourselves. It took nearly two hours to reach a hospital, and only my government identification got Brandon in to see a doctor. The hospital was overcrowded in the extreme, and Moscow was literally on fire from the rioting. While we waited for word on Brandon, and tried to comfort a very worried Sean, we watched the sky glowing red with distant fires. A ring of militia had cordoned off the hospital, just as they were doing with important locations throughout the city. All the television and radio stations were silent, and I was wondering what had gone wrong when a black car was admitted past the security ring. Several uniformed KGB officers got out, and I knew instinctively they were here for me. Chapter 28 The KGB was an organization not hemmed in by stupid considerations like the Geneva Convention, the International Agreement on Human Rights or any of the other numerous considerations in how to treat a prisoner. When Brian arrived at Lubyanka prison they made it clear to him that he would tell them what they wanted to know, and they started the process with their fists. Part of him hoped that Davey would somehow come for him, but on the second day they gave him copies of Pravda, the main newspaper. Later that day they threw in copies of the New York Times. Yeltsin was dead, Gorbachev had ceded power to the men who had started the coup, and their hopes for a better future were dead as well. If they thought that news would break him, they were wrong. Nor did he believe the claims that Davey and the others had been captured. He wouldn't believe anything they told him about Davey until they showed Brian his lover's body, alive or dead. The beatings continued for several days, and then they began the next course of treatment. Brian remembered the War on Terror and the secrets that came out of the second Bush that caused him to be a one-term President. Davey's father had spent a great deal of time rebuilding the US reputation after the extent of how America had tortured people became widely known. The man had barely been able to prevent the former President from being tried on War Crimes charges, but eventually the furor died down. These men didn't care about any of those things. Nor were they constrained by the semantics that limited the United States in its interrogation of terrorists. There were worst things than waterboarding, sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation and loud rock music. They worked faster too, and before a week was out, Brian was ready to tell them everything he knew, give them every answer that they wanted. They didn't believe him. As he stuttered out his confession of time travel and the intention of forging a stronger, more independent Russia in the years ahead, his interrogators didn't bother stifling their laughter. Brian would have laughed too, but it wasn't that type of situation. That was when they decided to start on his fingers, tearing his fingernails off with a device that had probably been invented by the Spanish Inquisition. The same men laughed at his screams of pain, and his stuttering insistence in Russian that every word he said was true. He didn't know how long the next phase of torture lasted, but when it ended he was little more than a bleeding wreck of a human being. That was when they started giving him morphine for the pain, and even after his fingers started healing, they kept giving him the wonderful, blissful pain medicine. Brian knew he was becoming addicted, but the desire for the sweet feeling of numbness and total release from the physical confines of his body had him craving for more, begging for more when they suddenly stopped giving him the drug. All sense of time had left him when the pains of withdrawal began to cramp his stomach, and he lost the tasteless gruel they had fed him for breakfast. For days he went through withdrawal, nausea, cramps, and the awful sweats filled his days and nights while he begged for some form of relief. When the worst of the withdrawal symptoms had passed, his wishes were granted and a soldier came in to give him another shot of the drug. \"You will wash yourself today.\" The guard said as he left Brian's small cell. The door opened a little later, and another soldier brought in several basins and washrags that Brian used to clean himself. His body was beginning to recover, and even his fingernails were beginning to grow again as he washed the crusted blood off of them. His hair had been shaved off to guard against lice in this place. The bruises on his face had largely healed, leaving only the palest of splotches on his once-pristine skin. Davey might not have liked what he saw if he could see Brian at that moment, but with the morphine in his system, Brian cared little about his lover's thoughts. All of that hurt, and only the numbing drug coursing through him let him look at himself in the small mirror they had provided. \"He will shave you.\" A guard said after Brian had dressed in the faded black jumpsuit they provided him. They shoved in a kid with a shaved head like Brian's, wearing faded jeans and a dingy shirt. The boy was barely eighteen, if he was even that old, and his hands were only slightly steadier than Brian's would have been on the razor. Still, he managed to shave off Brian's growing beard with only a few nicks, and then the guard was taking him away. They came for Brian a few minutes later, leading him through the narrow concrete hallways up into the ‘proper' area of the complex. The room they left him in was small, with bare concrete walls and a chair on either side of the table. He followed their instructions to sit in one of the chairs and didn't move as they chained him to it as they'd done before. He sat in the room for a long time, long enough for the effects of the morphine to start fading, and he was preparing himself once again for the withdrawals that would come when it left his system. It was obvious this was done on purpose, so that whenever his interrogator came in, he would be more cooperative, hoping they would give him more of the drug. That was what the small corner of his brain that still worked objectively told him while the greater part of him began plotting how he could make them happy so he would stop hurting. \"Greetings, comrade.\" An older man said in Russian as he entered the room. Brian had not seen the older, overweight man with the slightly bald head before. \"Privyet.\" Brian replied, also in Russian. He wasn't sure if he could even speak in anything but the most basic English anymore. \"You are looking better, comrade.\" The man said as he sat down across from Brian and placed a stack of papers on the table. \"Thank you.\" Brian said as politely as he could manage. \"I believe you should be a writer of fiction, comrade, with the story you have spun for your interrogators.\" The man continued. \"I am Colonel Bradikov, and your case of treason has been given to me to handle. Cooperate with me and you will find me a much better person than your previous handlers.\" \"I will cooperate.\" Brian murmured and hated himself for the words as soon as they left his mouth. The shakes were beginning again already, though, and he knew cooperation was the only way to get more. \"Yes, you will.\" Bradikov agreed. \"Even in your stories, there are grains of truth, and together we will work out those grains of truth. There will be no more interrogation sessions. Just you and I here in this room. Work with me, and you will be given better food, allowed to clean yourself, and of course, medicine for your pain.\" \"What do you want from me?\" Brian asked sadly, knowing he would do whatever the man wanted now that he had promised Brian more morphine. Part of him wondered how he'd gotten to this point so quickly, but most of him didn't care. \"Truth.\" Bradikov said simply. \"Your story is a sad one, of course. You were born to Soviet dissidents, raised in the United States and sent here as a spy to undermine the Motherland. Almost you succeeded and manipulated Comrade Yeltsin into betraying the People. Now you have seen the error of your ways and beg for the opportunity to serve the People in some way to make amends. Your confession will earn you your life, and the opportunity to work hard for the good of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… that's not…\" A spark rose in Brian, trying to resist, but it faded as the shakes grew worse. \"It is the truth, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently. \"The Soviet Union is strong, despite your treason. Your confession will help the People see the truth, and know their true enemy, the United States and its greedy capitalists. You are a product of their lies, but acted out of a true desire to better the people. That is commendable, and you will live out your life in the forests of Siberia with many others of your fellow misguided anarchists. Together you might one day earn your way back into the grand society of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… I…\" Brian stammered and then frowned. There had been nothing said about Davey, or the others, and he felt a glimmer of hope. If they were free, they could build another time machine and go back in time again. They could obliterate this timeline and start afresh. He held little doubt they would find the Brian of that timeline and he would help them, so it mattered little what he did now. \"Okay. You are right.\" \"Very good, comrade.\" Bradikov smiled and he got up, crossing over to Brian's side. With a key he took out of a pocket, he unlocked Brian's shackles. As Brian rubbed his wrists, the man took a needle out of his pocket, setting it down in front of Brian with a gentle smile. \"Here, comrade, for your pain.\" \"I…thank you.\" Brian stammered out as he blushed, ashamed for the greed that filled him. He did snatch the needle though, and injected himself so that he could feel the sweet release of the drug coursing through his system. \"You are very welcome, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently as he watched Brian closely. Brian was lost in the sweet numbing sensations of the drug, and didn't mind when the guards came to escort him back to his cell. Every day after that, Bradikov would summon Brian and they would go over his ‘confession' in detail. Certainly it was as filled with fiction as anything, but Brian only protested when they tried to pin everything on Davey. That protest earned him a week in his cell going through the pains of withdrawals, and then they dragged him back to Bradikov who demanded that Brian agree with the confession that would place most of the blame on Davey. When Brian didn't break, he was sent back to his cell for another week. After a month of this, when Brian had made it through the worst of the withdrawals and his head was beginning to clear up enough that he could almost think straight again, Bradikov realized his approach wasn't working. The beatings resumed, and his fingernails that had almost finished re-growing were ripped off again. Then they forcibly injected him with more drugs, stronger drugs this time. Having to guess from the effects on him, they were stepping him up to pure heroin or something similar. \"I always assumed that perverts like you only cared about the physical things.\" Bradikov said after doctors had spent a month nursing Brian back from the brink of death. His body still craved drugs, but his mind was clearer than it had been since he'd been taken to this hell hole. There had been times in the last few weeks that he couldn't remember his own name, but he'd never forgotten Davey's. \"You have no idea what we have been through together.\" Brian murmured in Russian. \"You have chased each other across time and space according to your story.\" Bradikov huffed. \"Your friends have tried to free you, by the way, with the backing of the new American President, but to no avail. It would have been easier on you to have another to blame, but we will proceed with your confession.\" \"Nyet.\" Brian protested. \"It is too late for anything else.\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have recorded your confessions, and you look quite healthy and convincing on the video. It will be better if you stand before the court and repeat your confession, but either way, it will be done. Cooperate, and you will lead the rest of your life in a work camp. Resist and you will face the firing squad for your treason.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" Brian murmured. \"You believe your friend will build another time machine and erase all that has happened?\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have learned the Australians believe their wild story, even if the Americans do not. We know better. Our top physicists assure us that it is impossible. Truly though, if you believe we will all cease to exist when they are done, what does it matter if you cooperate?\" \"I will do it.\" Brian murmured and ignored the smile on Bradikov's face. When the Colonel set a full needle in front of him, Brian turned his face away from the small thing. \"What, you have beaten your addictions?\" Bradikov laughed and Brian frowned. Oh how he wanted that needle, but he knew better than to take it now. He'd never, in all his life used drugs like this, and he knew he never would again. \"Not all of them.\" Brian sighed, yet he did not take the needle that was offered. \"You are a man of many surprises.\" Bradikov laughed. The work camp he went to after his trial was deep in the Siberian forests. Warm during the summer, freezing cold in the winter, he lived in one of five long barracks buildings with others that had been arrested and exiled following the pro-democracy demonstrations. They were well-guarded day and night, although the work of cutting trees and preparing them for shipping left Brian too tired to even contemplate escape. The food was horrible, and the company even worse. Brian found himself facing angry people that blamed him for their being here. When he fought them off one against one, or two against one, five of the toughest brutes in the camp jumped him. Still, he injured three of them badly enough they were in the primitive medical clinic alongside him. By the time his broken ribs healed and he was put back to work with the logging crews, he'd earned grudging respect. Most of the camp drank the home-brewed alcohol every night, passing their lives into oblivion. Brian stayed away from it with the well-earned aversion he now held to all types of drugs, not just heroin or morphine. The idea of being drunk was as abhorrent now as getting wasted on a needle full of heroin which was somehow plentiful in this place. His biggest hope, as the months and then the years went by was that Davey and the others would one day finish their time machine and end the misery of this existence. Even that hope grew dim as the years went by and many of the camp's worst drunks began dying in the harsh winters. He'd long ago taken young Misha, the thirteen-year old boy that was the youngest inmate in the camp under his wing and to his bed. Not for sex, but rather to stay warm during the freezing nights that claimed so many lives. Without his protection, Misha would have long since died although he did drink himself into a stupor nearly every night. He wasn't even a legal adult, and knew he'd die in this place. The few times he'd reached out to Brian for sexual release, he'd been gently rebuffed, but never strayed from Brian's bed. When Misha began to cough at night, Brian grew worried. Part of his mind warned that he should not let Misha sleep in his bed if he was sick, but Brian cared for the boy, the one bright spot in this miserable existence. Misha was a symbol to him, a symbol that even here in this hell hole he could make the world a slightly better place for even one person. Three weeks later, Misha was in the hospital wing as pneumonia claimed his life, and Brian was soon in a bed there as well as pneumonia took root in his own lungs. Modern antibiotics could have healed both of them, but the camp's doctor would not waste them on prisoners. Only guards got that sort of treatment. Even the food rations of sick prisoners were cut so that the food would go to other, stronger workers. Brian knew he was going to die, and welcomed the delirium as his fever began to grow. They were sweet dreams in the delirium, dreams of Davey and a few other men raiding the camp, freeing him and somehow sneaking him out of the camp. Dreams of a time machine, and whispered assurances that everything was going to be okay. He had the dream several times, and when the last one happened, he knew it was going to be the last dream ever. His body was weak and he no longer even tried to cough up the fluid that was filling his lungs. As he drifted off to sleep, he hoped that he would drown from the fluid in his lungs and die dreaming of his Davey. \"Brian.\" Oh great, instead of dreams about Davey, he was now having dreams about his mother. At least they would distract him from the realities of the cold Siberian winter, and he could feel the warmness of his childhood bed. Hearing his name in English sounded odd, after all these years though, and he wondered why he was dreaming in English. He hadn't dreamed in that language in a long, long time. \"Wake up, Brian!\" \"Nyet.\" Brian murmured as another male voice was added to the dream voice of his mother's. He told them in Russian that he loved his dreams more than reality. \"What language is that?\" His mother's voice asked as he dreamed of feeling her cool hand on his forehead. \"He has a fever. Feel his forehead. Oh dear, he's sick on the first day of school.\" Thinking of the first day of school made him think of Davey. Ah, this was better after all. His last dream before he died would be about the first day of middle school, where he and Davey always seemed to meet for the ‘first time' in a timeline. That would be a wonderful thing to dream about, to dream about the future of their lives together in a new timeline, even if it never came to reality. \"Now who could that be?\" Brian's father's voice sounded worried and Brian thought he could hear the chimes of the doorbell. \"Oh, hello.\" Brian's mother's voice was filled with surprise and worry. \"Brandon, Trevor, we didn't expect to see you here. Brian's not feeling to well.\" \"That's what we figured.\" Came the familiar voice of Trevor. \"Mrs. Breckenridge, these are some of our friends, Sean Rule, Todd Williams and Davey Jones. They came with us to get Brian and take him to school.\" \"I'm afraid he's too sick to go to school.\" Brian's mother said. \"Beloved, open your eyes.\" Davey said in Russian, and his voice sounded much younger. This was a good dream, Brian decided and opened his eyes to see a twelve-year old Davey Jones smiling at him. \"Young again, you look so young again.\" Brian said and was surprised that his chest didn't hurt. Naturally he spoke in Russian. \"What language is that?\" Brian's mother asked in a slightly high voice. \"It's Russian.\" Trevor answered. \"Brian doesn't speak Russian.\" She snapped. \"He does now.\" Trevor answered. \"Look, there are some things we should probably share with you. Why don't we go into the living room and we'll try to explain while Davey helps Brian.\" \"What's wrong with him?\" Brian heard his mother ask. \"He's had a rough couple of years.\" Brandon answered sadly, but Davey was taking all of Brian's attention. \"This is a nice dream.\" Brian said as he lifted his hand and ran a finger along Davey's cheek. His lover was always a little overweight at this age, but he still looked wonderful. \"It isn't a dream.\" Davey whispered in Russian. \"Yes it is.\" Brian said. \"It's my last dream. The pneumonia is going to kill me, I know it and I'm okay with it. You'll finish the time machine and make this awful timeline go away. Just don't mess up the next one, okay? I'd hate for that version of me to go through this hell. Still, I didn't betray you. Never you.\" \"I know love, I know.\" Davey whispered softly as he bent down and planted a kiss on Brian's nose. \"We did build the machine, and before we used it, we got you out of that damn place. It was close, and you were right, the pneumonia was killing you. Still, we were able to bribe the right people and found out where you were being held. The mercenaries we hired were good, and we got you out with the KGB hot on our trail.\" \"They didn't believe me about the time machine.\" Brian murmured. \"They figured it out in the end, and they believed alright.\" Davey laughed. \"They tried assaulting the facility, but we held them off, with the help of the Australians. Who would have believed it, the Australians helping us when our own country turned their backs on us?\" \"What did you have to give them?\" Brian asked, playing along with the wonderful dream. \"Our solemn promise to not try changing the course of history again.\" Davey laughed. \"I expected them to demand one of their own go back, but they laughed and said they knew better than to mess with history. The only reason they helped us at all was because the Soviet Union was starting to duke it out with Europe and the United States. Their economy was still shit, and they had to stir up trouble in order to keep things under control.\" \"Sounds awful.\" Brian murmured, just letting himself get lost in those wonderful blue eyes that he'd dreamed about, and was still dreaming about. \"Your temperature is dropping.\" Davey said softly. \"Sean was worried that your fever in the other timeline would be replicated here because you believed you were sick. At the end you were delirious, and even though your body is healthy in the here and now, the mind has an awful lot of control over how the body works, and I know you've been through hell.\" \"We've all been through hell.\" Brian murmured, letting himself feel Davey's hand on his chest, and relishing the smile. This was definitely the best of his delirious dreams. \"This is the last time, I promise.\" Davey whispered. \"We set it so we got back here a week before you, and we had time to prepare for today.\" \"What do you mean?\" Brian asked with a frown and something deep inside began whispering to him that this was real, not another dream. It certainly felt more real than any other dream he'd had. \"We made a promise to the Australians, and we're going to keep that promise.\" Davey said with a firm expression. \"No more mucking with the timeline, for the most part. No more trying to save people from AIDS, or stopping Osama bin Laden, or getting rid of the second Bush Presidency. If people are stupid enough to vote for the man, then they're going to have to live with the consequences.\" \"But…\" Brian's voice trailed off and he realized that Davey had said the last in English. The language was coming back to him, slowly but surely. \"No buts, love.\" Davey said in a soft whisper. \"Some things will change. The others are telling your mother and father right now. They need to know because we'll need their help making sure my father doesn't do… some of the stupid things he's done before. Papa knows too. He's a smart man and he's proven in the past he can help us, and he is, you know.\" \"Let me guess, he won some money on a bet.\" Brian laughed softly, and English felt a little odd on his tongue, but good as well. This was how it should be. \"It worked, and it's enough to get things started.\" Davey said. \"No one will be rich, but we will be able to get our families off the ground in their own businesses. There will be fights when they figure it out about us, but we can win those fights as well. No going to the President though, no warning him about the future, or the next President, or the one after that. We let those events play out as they will.\" \"Is that not a little selfish of us?\" Brian asked as he sat up and leaned against his headboard to look at Davey. \"I think we've earned the selfishness.\" Davey sighed. \"What about making the world a better place?\" Brian asked determinedly. \"I didn't go through all that to just give up.\" \"What would you have us do?\" Davey asked with exasperation. \"I don't want to lose you again.\" \"Maybe, maybe there's another way.\" Brian asked with a shrug. \"I don't know, but if we really are here, well there has to be a way. We've always tried changing things from the top. Maybe we can change them from the bottom.\" \"It's worth trying.\" Davey said gently and he leaned forward until their lips met. Brian's mind was still hazy, and he knew there would be a lot of issues for him to overcome. His treatment at the hands of the Soviets had been bad, and would require a lot of time to undo all the problems he had experienced. As their kiss deepened, and he felt his love and passion for Davey grow again, he knew that it was something they would be able to do together. Together they could conquer the world. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The End.",

What do you say when the world is ending and your only option is what you promised to never do again? Chapter 1 “I’m way too old for this.” Sean muttered as they stood over the control console and the machine sputtered to life. He’d always been on the short side, and now in his eighties he begrudged every millimeter of height he lost with advancing age. My own hands were as wrinkled as his while I pushed the appropriate buttons on the computer console. The familiar sound of a magnetic resonance imager spinning to life filled the small room. “I can’t believe this specific machine has been used as a regular MRI for twenty years without anyone knowing it was really a time machine.” I muttered and Sean chortled softly before pushing another button and inserting the small flash drive into the correct slot. Five seconds later, the program was being loaded. “It’s always best to hide things in plain sight.” Sean muttered a very familiar mantra and I nodded my agreement. “The time bubble is now active. We’re safe as long as we remain in here.” “No one can come in?” I asked, although I already knew the answer. It was a sign of how nervous I really was. “You know that.” Sean smiled. “We’ve got plenty of power for what we need to do, but not much more than that. The bubble will keep people out, and it’ll keep the radiation out as well.” “That’s good or we might not live long enough to do this.” I said unnecessarily. We both knew the dirty bomb that had gone off thirty minutes ago was killing millions outside the bubble. That was why we’d been sent down here, on direct orders of the President. President David Jones Sr. had passed away many years ago, and while the man who currently held that office was of a different political party, the legacy of knowledge about time travel had been passed to the current President. Every President since Jones had known about the ability to go back in time, but none had given in to the temptation until now. “The program is uploaded.” Sean said with a hint of excitement. Both of our hands were shaking as our eyes met and I nodded. He typed in the execute command, and the machine on the other side of the room began to whir faster. There was no one inside it, but the components that sent a person’s memories back in time were active, sending out the program that Sean and Brandon had developed a decade ago. “It’s working.” Sean said as he nodded with his head towards the television in the corner. It had been showing static, but now it showed a newscaster talking about some report regarding the War on Terror. “That’s still going on?” “It should be over by now.” I muttered, shaking my head as Sean turned up the volume and we listened to the report about the forty-year old war. “The fucker died in bed?” Sean growled angrily. “How much time do we have before the bubble runs out of power?” I asked. “If we don’t use the machine to go back, we could survive in here longer than we have food or water.” Sean answered. “If we use the machine, it depends on how far back we go. The program worked, by the way.” “I figured that.” I answered with a gruff voice and a shake of my head. They were gone, my husband and partner, our sons, our grandkids were all erased along with every instance of time travel in the history of humanity. Our orders were not to go back, but to run the program, erase time travel and all the possible timelines it had created, and then shut down the machine so that we were erased as well. We would pass out of existence, and with us the knowledge of time travel would be gone forever, or at least until someone else invented it in the far future. “Any luck connecting to the Internet?” I asked and Sean started cussing. “All the wireless signals are encrypted and I can’t get around them.” He muttered. “They must use some type of system our timeline never invented.” “That’s a pain in the ass.” I agreed with his sentiments. We’d hoped to use the Internet to make sure this timeline was free from nuclear bombs, gas attacks, and all that crap. “I take it we’ve just got broadcast television, not cable or satellite?” “Just broadcast.” Sean muttered. “Let’s see what we can find.” I said, moving to change the channel. Eight hours later we were both thirsty and had to relieve ourselves in a corner of the room. It now smelled like urine, but we barely noticed based on the things we’d learned. “Amazing how much you can learn just from watching television.” Sean groused as he switched off the offending machine. “Israel nuked six years ago, and the United States held hostage by six ships in harbors of American cities, threatening to detonate nuclear bombs if we interfere.” “They were all wrong.” I muttered with a shake of my head. “The world wasn’t necessarily a better place without the interference of time travel.” “Plan B, then?” Sean asked and I nodded. “Do we have a choice?” I asked. “How much power do we have left?” “Enough to send one person to 1986 and that’s it.” Sean said after he looked at the display panel. “You know it’s not going to be easy. There won’t be any other time travelers now, just whichever of us goes back this time. Plus, we don’t know every little detail of this future or how to fix it.” “We know how to be in place when the time comes.” I answered with a heavy sigh. To be honest, I was looking forward to dying in my old age. My life had been a good one, and if not for this one last incident, I could have died a happy man without time travel messing up my life again. “You want to go, Sean?” “Don’t be an idiot.” Sean growled with a grimace. “I am plenty happy to die when the bubble collapses and leave you to carry the responsibility alone.” “Fine, let’s do it.” I muttered and Sean nodded once with a hint of understanding in his eyes. It took another hour for the preparation to be made and I was laying on the table waiting to be inserted into the machine. Sean was sticking a needle in my arm, injecting the drugs that would slow my brain function and highlight the necessary memories stored in my brain. Then the machine would scan them, record them, and send them back in time to my younger body. This would be different, because the program we’d run hours earlier had ‘jammed’ the signals of other time machines, effectively stopping the transmissions of earlier time travelers. The 1986 I was about to enter was pristine, unchanged by the meddling of other time travelers. Ronald Reagan was President, I lived in Modesto California and David Jones Sr. wasn’t a member of the President’s cabinet. He’d never be President either. So much would be gone, so much of the world I had loved for the past sixty years would be gone forever, and I’d have to build a new life with my love, who wouldn’t even be a friend in this original timeline. Would he remember me at all? Could I convince him he was better off with me than with where his life would lead otherwise? We’d have decades, well years, to try and make it work before anything would need to be done. The history of previous time travel taught that making big changes would only backfire, that small changes yielded the best results. Even with the dirty bomb that had gone off in Washington D.C., this last timeline had been the best of them all. For thirty years there had been a peace relatively unknown in the history of the world, and the history books of that timeline had credited President David Jones Sr. with forging that peace. It had only been bungling by several of the Presidents who took office after him that had created a situation where so many people had died in needless conflict. The old saying was that Pride Goeth Before the Fall, and the pride of the men and women in that office had been high, too high. As always, it had been the common people who had paid the price for the pride of their leaders, and at the last, even the leaders had seen their errors. “You ready?” Sean asked as the drug began to take effect. Really, kind of late for that question wasn’t it, but he knew what Sean was doing. He could die now, never having to go back in time, and Sean would remove his body from the table and go back himself. The burden could be placed squarely on Sean’s shoulders this time, instead of his, but he remembered how painful Sean’s teenage years had been in the original timeline, the timeline he was preparing to go back to, and he shook his head. Sean smiled with tears in his eyes as things began to go grey for me. “Thank you.” Those were the last words I heard as everything went black. How long things were black, I couldn’t tell, but eventually I was able to open my eyes. It was still dark, and I was on my back, in bed. It took a few minutes for me to stumble out of bed. My entire body felt different, moved different, and as I reached the light switch and my eyes squinted in the sudden brightness, I let out a sigh of relief. My vision was clear, no need for those damn glasses. The back of my hands were smooth, with no age spots or wrinkles, and when I ran them over my body, I could feel how tight and smooth it was as compared to my sixty-odd year old body I had just left. My room wasn’t that different than what I had expected and I let out a sigh of relief. Sure, there were difference, like the picture on my desk, but they weren’t shockingly strange. A glance at the clock showed that it was nearly time for me to be up anyway, so I opened my door and proceeded to the shower. It was good, being in my young body again, I decided as I finished the shower and let out a sigh of relief at the dirty deed I’d just finished along with my cleaning. The images of my husband in his youth had been fresh and clear in my mind as were the images and memories of our lives together. Fifty plus years had passed by in the last timeline, and we’d spent them with each other and our children and their children. That should be more than enough for most couples, and it had been, but now I was wondering what another fifty years would be like, and I had a wistful smile on my face as I wrapped the wet towel around my waist and exited the bathroom, only to run into my father. “Brian, what are you doing up?” He asked with surprise and I had to resist the urge to hug him right away. I was fairly sure that, even as good of a son as I was, my father wasn’t use to hugs from his sixteen-year-old son. He’d died ten years ago in the last timeline and I had missed him almost as much as I’d missed mom, who died five years later. “I thought I’d go for a run.” I answered and he gave me a look like I was half-crazy. “You’re still grounded, remember?” He had a warning tone in his voice and I winced. Grounded? What had I done to be grounded? “I don’t care if it was New Year’s Eve, coming home at six in the morning with alcohol on your breath and your girlfriend in the car with you is not behavior I expect from you.” “I… I’m sorry.” I said with shock. “You’re damn right you’re sorry, Brian.” My dad fumed as his anger started rising. Oh fuck, he was really mad. Then again, he had a right to be. I had been a father, and remembered Richie doing something like that when he’d been seventeen. We’d grounded the boy for two months. The thought of my son, who was dead and gone now, brought tears to my eyes. Dad looked at me with some surprise. “Are you progressing to fake tears now?” “No.” I said hoarsely. “No, I’m just… you’re right. I could have killed both of us driving after drinking, and you’re right, it wasn’t right to bring her here. I should have taken her home.” “Well, finally you’re showing some sense instead of talking back or giving me the cold shoulder.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Don’t think you’re un-grounded though. That stays; you’re grounded until your birthday. No car, no friends over, no girlfriends over, and no parties. When school starts, we’ll let you drive your car to school, but you have to come straight home.” “Can I at least go running in the mornings?” I asked. “I promise, I won’t use it to meet up with friends or anything, just go running, by myself.” “What if you just happen to run into a friend along the way?” Dad asked with a frown. “I’ll tell them hello and that my evil father grounded me and I can’t talk to them until school starts.” I said with a half-grin that I knew always softened him up. He actually laughed before giving me a strange look. “Son, I don’t know what happened overnight, but it’s like you finally grew the fuck up.” My dad said with a shake of his head. “I like this Brian a hell of a lot better than the one that told me I was an idiot before he went to bed.” “I’m sorry about that too.” I said, horrified that I would have ever said something like that to my father. He’d always been a good father, one I could tell anything to, or at least he had been in the last timeline. This man didn’t seem all that different than the one I’d known, so I had to wonder if it had been me that had been so different? “You can go for your run.” He said after looking into my eyes. “I don’t know what changed overnight, but I’m willing to trust you this much. Don’t screw it up.” “I won’t, dad.” I said, giving in to the urge to hug him. He looked surprised, but returned the hug after a moment. Then it was time to go back to my room, find a pair of sweats to put on, and to stretch. Old age had put an end to my daily runs with Davey, but we’d still gone for walks each and every day we were both home. Once he’d had his stroke and couldn’t walk anymore, I’d pushed him in his wheelchair around the park across the street from our home. In the last few months, he’d been able to speak a little bit and his constant announcements of how much he loved me had assured me that the stroke may have taken away a lot of things, but it hadn’t taken my Davey away from me. It was refreshingly cold outside as I began my run, and I almost considered going back for another sweatshirt. There was no need though as I began to sweat with the pace I started, trying to see just how my younger body reacted. Running was good not only for my body, but because it allowed me time to think about the situation I was now experiencing. I personally had no memories of this timeline. Everything I knew about it was from what I’d been told by Davey and by Sean. Fortunately, thanks to how time travel worked, I had perfect memories of those conversations. Rather unfortunately, neither of them had been entirely forthcoming about this timeline. Both of them viewed it as a ‘dark’ timeline for them personally and had been reluctant to share details. Still, there were some details that I did know and as I ran, I went over them carefully. All my life, I had known that I wasn’t nearly as smart as either Davey or Sean. They could take in any situation and find solutions to problems like it was no more difficult than breathing. In law school, I’d learned that I could also solve problems, but it took me longer. I had to do a lot of research, and have time to properly prepare what I learned. Then I had to take more time preparing my arguments, figuring out the counter-arguments, and then the counters to those counter-arguments. Davey could do it in the flash of an eye whereas I took hours and hours, but eventually I’d come up with the solution. Sometimes, when the solution required a lot of research and preparation, Davey would flounder while I eventually solved the riddle of the problem. That would be my greatest asset in this situation. I only had pieces of the puzzles that led to the problems off in the far-future in this timeline. For the closer future problems, such as how to win Davey over, I had less time and just as few pieces of the puzzle, but I did have time to think things through and find some solutions. Time was both my enemy and my ally now. President Jones was a key figure in figuring out how to win Davey in this timeline. Not in the sense he might have been if this was 1981, but in the sense of what was going on now. It was our junior year of high school, and Davey had given me several clues as to what was going on with him now. Just thinking about what he was going through made me stumble and lose my pace. Here, in this timeline, Davey and I had never really been friends. We were more like ‘friendly acquaintances’, to use his term, when we were in our freshman year of high school. He’d moved away that year, to a place called Eureka, Nevada. His sophomore year, he’d returned after his mother learned that his father in that timeline had sexually molested Jenny. The thought of President Jones being capable of doing such an evil thing caused me to shudder, and I resumed my earlier pace, enjoying the brisk winter chill, my foggy breath steaming out of me, and the heat being generated by my body as I continued to run. I knew that when they moved back to California, they’d lived with his Nanny, his maternal grandmother and he’d gone to Ceres High for the rest of his sophomore year. Then he’d gotten his mother to get him transferred to Downey for his junior year, the school I attended with our friends Trevor and Brandon. Sean, in this timeline, no longer attended the school because of his ultra-religious parents. Or did he? I could never quite remember that because Sean had never really been specific, nor had Davey. When Davey had gone back to Downey, he’d found we’d all moved on with our lives and didn’t really remember him. As a result, he’d pulled in on himself and sometime during the last half of his junior year, he’d quit going to school, gotten his GED and ended up graduating from Navy boot camp three months before the rest of us graduated from High School. There was much more I didn’t know. Where did he live? Would he still find me interesting? I knew he was already having sex, but then apparently so was I with my ‘girlfriend’, whoever that was in this timeline. Did the fact that we were both already sexually active make it impossible for him to love me the way he did before? No, those were personal insecurities that I’d always felt, and I refused to let them stop me from gaining the love of Davey Jones. Another question I’d have to deal with eventually is what do I tell Davey, and my other friends, about time travel? The secrets of how to build a time machine were dead and gone, and I didn’t know nearly enough to help build another one. Nor did I think we should. That thought made me stop for a bit, breathing heavily into the cold air as I pondered if I was being a hypocrite. I was thinking time travel should die forever, but I’d used it to correct a situation. No, I couldn’t lie to myself. I was far to old to shy away from the truth. Some part of me had known in that last world that Davey and I had never been a couple and I’d come back to change that. Back in the time bubble, I hadn’t even thought about it directly, but down deep I knew the great love of my life had never happened and I couldn’t stand to let things stay that way. The excuse about ‘fixing’ the events of this timeline forty-odd years from now was just that, an excuse, to do what I really wanted. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor’s voice surprised me and I turned to see my old friend jogging up the sidewalk towards me. He had a broad smile on his face and stopped when he reached me. “So, you tricked your old man into letting you out after all?” “No.” I answered a little more harshly than I intended. Some part of me had forgotten how handsome Trevor was at this age. His brown curly hair practically gleamed and while he was a good four inches shorter than me, his body was perfectly trim and in shape. “Sorry, but I promised him I wouldn’t use running as an excuse to get out of being grounded.” “Dude, what’s wrong with you?” Trevor snorted and gave me a look like I was crazy. “Nothing.” I said as I turned and started to head back to the house. “I’ll talk to you in school, Trevor.” “You’re insane!” Trevor shouted. “Did you forget I was supposed to take you to Missy’s?” “Tell her I’ll talk to her in school!” I shouted back. “She’s going to go apeshit!” Trevor shouted but I was far enough away that he didn’t bother trying to catch up. That had been another shock; that the me of this timeline had planned to sneak out just like this, but unlike me hadn’t intended on keeping his word to dad. What the fuck was wrong with this timeline? “You’re back.” Dad said as I walked through the front door. He was wearing an old pair of jeans and a t-shirt as if he was preparing to do some work around the house. I could hear Mom in the kitchen, probably fixing breakfast from the smells that were wafting around the house. “Yes.” I answered him and he nodded. “Your mother will have breakfast ready soon.” He said. “I’ll need your help in the garage after breakfast. The dryer’s squealing.” “It’s probably the motor belt.” I said and he just looked at me. “I’m going to take another shower, okay?” “That’s fine.” He said and I headed into my room. I noticed the pile of school books on the desk and wondered if I had homework left to do. In my own timeline I’d have been confident that I’d already done them, but there was a nagging bit of doubt in me that the “me” of this timeline would probably have just ignored them during the holiday break from school. As I showered for the second time this morning, I wondered what I would find when I went back to school. This should be the Saturday morning before school started, if the machine had worked the way it was supposed to in sending me back here. I could feel my heart racing as I thought about what I would find when I went to school. Would he be there? Would he be in any of my classes? For that matter, what classes would I have and in what time periods? “Good morning, honey.” My mom said as I entered the dining room where she’d already set three places for breakfast. It was nice seeing her so young again, and she smiled when I gave her a hug before sitting down. Dad just watched me in silence while we started eating. Part of me wanted some of the coffee they were both drinking, but I settled for the glass of orange juice to go with the waffles, sausage and eggs. I’d dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, similar to dad’s, so that I’d be ready to work with him as soon as breakfast was done. “Did you see anyone on your run?” Dad asked me after a few minutes of silence. “Yes, Trevor was running too.” I said calmly, watching him as he raised an eyebrow. “Is that why you came back so early?” He asked and I nodded. “I told him I was still grounded.” I informed him. “Good, because you are.” He said sternly and that killed all the remaining conversation until we’d finished eating. As I worked with him on the dryer, I knew things were not okay between him and I in this time, and I debated with myself on how to change that. In the end, I decided it would just take time. “Thanks for your help.” He said as we listened to the dryer run smoothly about an hour later. “No problem.” I replied. “Your homework done yet?” He asked me and I shook my head. “Well you have plenty of time today and tomorrow to work on it.” “Thanks.” I said, taking that as a dismissal and heading inside. After washing my hands, I went into my room and began to look through the books and notebooks scattered on my desk. Twenty-three minutes later I wasn’t a happy camper. The classes I was in at school weren’t what I expected. They weren’t exactly idiot-level courses, but they weren’t the advanced placement courses I’d taken in my own timeline. To make matters worse, the notebooks seemed to be filled with stupid notes between Trevor and I about the physical and mental attributes of girls in our classes. There weren’t even notes about our assignments. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. Giving up in disgust with myself, I got up and went to find one of my parents. “Hi mom.” I said as I found her in her sewing room. She at least smiled at me. “Hello Bri.” She said as she stopped the machine she was using to sew together a dress. “What is it?” “Is Dad here?” I asked. “No, he’s gone over the Marshall’s house for a bit.” She replied. “Oh, I was going to ask him if I could call Brandon.” I said with a sigh. “My notes aren’t clear about one of my assignments and I was going to see if he could help me out.” “Brandon’s not in any of your classes except P.E.” Mom said with a frown and a sharp look at me. “What are you trying to pull?” “I think he has one of my notebooks in his backpack.” I said while trying not to wince at that. “Your dad has your assignments listed from your teachers.” She informed me and this time I wanted to groan. “After your awful grades he got them from your instructors.” “Oh, then I don’t need to call someone.” I said softly. “Do you know where it is?” “Yes.” She said, giving me a sharp look. “You sure you still don’t need to make a call?” “Yeah, I just need the assignments.” I told her and she shook her head. “I almost believe you.” She said as she stood up and went into their bedroom. When she came out, she handed me two sheets of paper with all the assignments written on them. The bad news was that there was a lot listed there, but the good news was that the classes were so easy I’d be able to breeze right through them. “Thanks mom.” I said with a smile. “Don’t forget your father will want to look over them tomorrow.” She warned me and I just nodded. Several times during the youth of our last timeline, Davey had commented on how doing high school work again was both easy and difficult at the same time. For the first time I really understood what he’d meant when he said that. Math was easy, especially this basic algebra crap I was taking now. The English essay I had on a reading assignment was just as easy. The book was even an old favorite of mine in the last timeline, so I just had to skim through certain parts of it to make sure my recollections were correct. History was difficult. It wasn’t difficult because I didn’t remember what the importance of the Magna Carta was, but because most of the assignment was about the memorization of dates. Instead of asking why the provisions of habeus corpus were so groundbreaking, it asked how many of the King’s nobles participated in forcing him to sign the document and what year it was done. Bah! “You want some lunch, honey?” Mom asked several hours later as she poked her head in my door. Apparently I was not just doing assignments over the break, but make-up work to get my grades up a bit. They were barely enough to keep me eligible for sports, and if I was right in my guesses, that was all my younger self was caring about right now. Maybe there was some truth to what Davey and Sean had always said about this timeline. “That’d be nice, Mom.” I said with a smile. She came back a few minutes later with a ham sandwich that I ate while I continued doing math problems with one hand. For a while she just stood there watching me with a little smile on her face. Part of me wondered just how mean this timeline’s Brian had been to her. “How is the homework coming?” My dad asked from the doorway three hours later. “I’m halfway to being caught up.” I told him honestly. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to work out a bit, take a break, and then maybe work on the rest after dinner.” “How about we go out to a movie tonight and you finish up the rest tomorrow?” Dad offered and I raised my eyebrows in surprise. He smiled at me. “It’s been a while since we did anything as a family, and you’ve been working hard today.” “That’d be nice.” I said and he nodded before shutting the door behind him as he left. By Sunday night, the night before school started, I’d confirmed that my relations with my parents were strained at best. I wanted to curse the Brian of this timeline that had apparently made several bad decisions, but that was impossible. He was as gone as if he’d never existed. Now I just had to pick up the pieces of that life. By the end of the weekend, I felt that I had made a good start, although I almost ruined by starting to ask mom about Uncle Rich. He’d lived to the age of seventy-three in the last timeline, but I’d forgotten that he’d be dead of AIDS in this timeline. He’d died right before Christmas in 1981, and when Dad had brought up the idea of selling his apartment in San Francisco, I’d almost asked about him. Apparently the younger me had wanted to sell it, and they had been resisting doing that for the last few years. Now they’d relented and were ready to put it on the market. They were surprised by my ‘sudden change of mind’. “Here are your keys.” Dad said early on Monday morning, as I got ready for school. He was looking at my clothes with a hint of approval. I’d chosen my clothes carefully, picking a good pair of jeans, penny loafers, a dark blue V-neck sleeveless sweater, and a blue dress shirt under that. “Thanks, Dad.” I said as I took the keys to my re-built mustang. I’d only looked at the car so far, but I knew that Brian Breckenridge of any timeline would love to have that car. “Remember, you’re to come right home after school.” He reminded me sternly and I just nodded, hefting my backpack with all my books and completed homework assignments as I left the house. I’d already kissed mom goodbye for the day. The Downey High student parking lot was the same no matter the timeline, and I pulled into the first spot I found, glad that it wasn’t full yet. To my relief, Brandon and Trevor were waiting in the usual spot near the front entrance. Some things didn’t change, at least. “At least you dressed up for her, but where’s Missy?” Trevor asked after we nodded at each other. “What do you mean?” I asked him with a furrow of my eyebrows. “Dude, you fucking ditch her on Saturday after sneaking out from being grounded, and now you don’t even pick her up like you do every morning?” Trevor snorted. “You better get your ass to pick her up or she ain’t gonna put out for you again!” “Oh shit.” I muttered, turning back towards the parking lot before I realized I didn’t even know whom the girl was or where she lived. I started to turn around, but a familiar figure caught my eye as he passed by us on his way inside. His familiar blond hair was long and shaggy, looking like he’d not had it cut in the last few months. It was still that familiar shade of dirty blond though, and his crooked nose stuck out like it always did. I couldn’t see his eyes from this angle, but I took in the faded jean jacket, worn jeans with holes forming, and sneakers that looked like they’d been too close to a fire all with a single glance. He was also a little heftier than I remembered him ever being, but there was no mistaking him for anyone else in the world. “Hey, Davey!” I called out, leaving my two friends to follow the sixteen, almost seventeen, year old version of the man I loved more than life itself. He turned at the sound of his name, and looked at me as if he didn’t recognize me. That was like a knife through the gut, but I put a smile on my face anyway. Davey stood there, silently looking me up and down, and then at the hand I was now sticking out to him. “You’re Davey Jones, right? Didn’t you play on the freshman team before you moved out to…um…” “Nevada.” He answered in a very familiar bass and I wanted to sigh with relief as he took my hand and shook it. “Brian, right?” “Yeah, so you’re back in town, huh?” “Um, yeah, we moved back last year.” He said. “I’m in the same history class as you.” “Oh, um, well I kept on trying to remember where I knew you from and I just realized it was from freshman football.” I said quickly, wishing I was as good at him when it came to dancing with words on the spur of a moment. “Say, you remember Trevor and Brandon, don’t you?” “Yeah.” Davey said as I tried to steer him back towards them. He looked like he was struggling with wanting to leave and wanting to stay, but Trevor ruined the moment. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor called out. “You better hurry or your girlfriend is going to dump you!” “I’ll see you later.” Davey said as he turned and headed inside the school, hanging his head as he went. His shoulders were slumped forward as he walked, and I wondered what would make my Davey walk like that. I’d always known him to stand tall. Even after his stroke, his first struggle had been to hold his head upright and he’d fought and fought until he could hold his head high on his own. Yes, I realized as I turned to talk Brandon into going with me so I’d know where I was going, there were so many things to fix in the here and now. Chapter 2 It was the slap heard around the world, or at least around Downey High. By lunchtime, the entire school seemed to have heard about the scene in the parking lot that morning. Marcie had come flying out of a car, driven by her older brother and rounded on me as I was just unlocking the Mustang’s driver-side door. Hours later, I could still feel the sting of that slap, and wondered what the hell my younger self of this timeline had seen in her. Sure, she was good looking. Davey had often overlooked the fact that I was bisexual more than I was gay, but then he’d never had cause to doubt my love for him. Physically, I could see why I would be interested in Marcie, but her attitude left a lot to be desired. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” She’d yelled at me after slapping me. “First, you blow me off like I’m nothing on Saturday and then you don’t pick me up this morning, making me get a ride from my stupid brother! What’s going on with you, Brian?” “I’m grounded.” I’d growled at her and she’d laughed in this high, shrill tone, throwing her blond hair over her shoulder. She was dressed in this short mini-skirt and tight top that left little to the imagination. Yeah, she definitely had a good body, but everything else was the shits. “What the fuck is that supposed to matter?” She screamed. “Who cares if your idiot parents ground you? You’re supposed to care about me before anyone else, remember?” “Get a grip.” I’d growled, and had gotten another slap before she stormed off without saying another word. Brandon tried to hide his grin behind a hand, but he got a glare from me as I relocked my door and headed back towards the campus. At least now I wouldn’t be late for school. “Dude, you’re going to have to do a lot of making up to her.” Brandon sniggered and I pushed at him with my shoulder as we walked towards my locker. I just hoped the combination wouldn’t be any different than the one I remembered. It wasn’t, and I put my books away without saying another word. I’d have to break up with ‘Marcie’ before too long, but part of me was reticent to do that right away. Davey’s warnings about making too many rapid changes stuck in my head from the times we’d discussed these aspects of time travel. I didn’t want to end up in a mental institution or a government lab. “Did you forget you’re supposed to take me to lunch?” Marcie’s voice pulled me out of my reverie and I turned to look at her with a frown. Apparently I had the same lunch period as her, and she expected me to take her somewhere. Damn, there went my plans to ‘meet’ up with Davey for lunch. “No.” I answered her, trying to put a smile on my face. At that moment I had never missed my Davey so much. How the hell had I ended up with this bitch instead of the calm, loving man I had just spent seven decades of my life with? “Where do you want to go?” “The usual.” She said flatly. “Aren’t you tired of that place yet?” I asked, trying to get her to tell me exactly what ‘the usual’ meant. “No way in hell am I tired of that place.” She frowned. “Everyone sees us together there so they know you’re mine. I thought you liked that. You told me you did.” “Yeah, well, sometimes the food gets old.” I temporized and she frowned even more. “What’s the matter, Brian darling?” She asked in the most sickeningly sweet voice as she stepped up and put her hand on my chest. I wanted to shudder. “You haven’t even kissed me yet, and now you don’t want to go to Furnow’s for lunch?” “Sorry.” I said as I hugged her and planted a kiss on her cheek. A little voice in my head was yammering about this being a betrayal of Davey and it got louder when she tried to kiss me on the mouth. “Dude, you going to lunch?” Brandon’s voice saved me as I jerked my head to look at my friend. Marcie frowned. “Katie and I thought we might join you today.” “That would be good.” I said quickly, ignoring Marcie’s frown. Katie must be the black-haired girl that was with Brandon. She was petite, but had a fair-sized pair of breasts that looked quite confined in the low-necked blouse she was wearing. God, what was wrong with me and my friends that we were dating girls who thought it necessary to show all their assets? Marcie wasn’t happy about the company, but she looped her arm through mine and practically dragged me towards the parking lot. My dislike for her was getting to be extreme, and as I unlocked the passenger door for her, I debated on whether dumping her would be a ‘small’ change or a ‘big’ one. Davey had always said big changes were bad, but if dumping her was a big one, I might have to risk the consequences. Brandon and his girlfriend got in the back seat, and I had to keep a smirk off my face. Trevor and I were bisexual, although he leaned more towards girls as he got older, while Davey, Sean and Brandon had always been gay from everything I’d heard. Sure Brandon had dated, and had sex with girls in high school of the original timeline (according to Sean), but according to Davey, Brandon had come out in college and never looked back. As we were pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed Davey in a blue Pontiac behind us, and kept on eye on the rear-view mirror as he followed us out of the lot. He turned at the first light though, and I lost track of him. I’d learned that he was in my history class, but he had sat on the far side of the room from me and disappeared as soon as the bell rang. Well, there was plenty of time, I kept reminding myself. Still, it hurt seeing him so young again, and not being able to wrap my arms around him, kiss him, or to talk with him all night long. “BRIAN!” Marcie’s screech reminded me I was driving and I slammed on the brakes just in time to keep from slamming into a car that was stopped for a red light. “What’s the matter with you? You’ve been acting all weird since Saturday! Snap out of it!” “Shut up.” I growled at her, and she glared at me, accompanied by the noise of two people in the back seat sucking in their breath in surprise. “What did you say to me?” Marcie’s voice grew dangerously low as a honk from behind told me the light was green and I started driving again. “I’m not a doormat, you know.” I said with a hint of anger in my voice. “Who said you were?” She retorted angrily. “You do with the way you talk to me.” I replied, enjoying the surge of anger and the tingling it brought to my fingers. I’d forgotten how strong emotions were at this age, and it felt good. “I do not.” She huffed as she crossed her arms just below her bosom. “You better take that back right now if you want to keep my love.” “Stop being such a little girl.” I snorted as a fresh wave of anger came over him. I was too old to be dealing with shit like this. “How dare you say that to me?” She roared and made to move as if she was going to open the door. “If you’re going to jump out of the car you better wait until I can pull over.” I said as they pulled to a stop at another light. “Take me back to the school right now!” She demanded and I was only too happy to agree. I’d barely had time to stop the car in a parking spot at the student lot before she was out the door. She paused while waiting for Brandon’s girlfriend to get out. Katie was making sympathetic noises while Brandon and I got out and I waited for whatever was to come next. Once again I wished for the ability to easily deal with people that Davey had possessed, but that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. “What is wrong with you, Brian?” Marcie demanded angrily after stomping around the car and getting in my face. Spittle flew from her lips and landed on my face, but I resisted the urge to wipe it off. “Nothings wrong with me.” I answered after thinking for a moment. “I just don’t like being treated like a doormat.” “How long have we been going out?” She asked, and I froze, sparing a quick glance at Brandon but he didn’t know I needed his help. Her face grew even redder as the silence continued and she realized I couldn’t answer. “You mean you can’t even fucking remember we’ve been going out for nine months now! I gave you my virginity and you can’t tell me how long we’ve gone out but you can tell me you think I’m treating you like a doormat? Well, I got news for you, Brian Breckenridge. If this is the best you can do, you don’t deserve to be dating me!” She turned on her heels and stormed off, pulling Brandon’s girlfriend in her wake. Brandon leaned back against my car, shaking his head and obviously fighting a losing battle with an urge to laugh. More than a few students had seen the tail end of this show, but I wasn’t as concerned with that as I would have been if I was really sixteen, well sixteen going on seventeen real soon. “Dude, what the fuck is up with you?” Brandon asked after he got his laughter under control. Last week you’re all like ‘Oh, she’s the one, Brandon. I love her. We’re going to get married as soon as we’re out of high school!’ Now you’re like ‘you treat me like a doormat!’ What’s going on, bro?” “You don’t think she treats me like a doormat?” I asked and he chuckled. “Dude, something wrong with your memory?” Brandon asked with a shake of his head. “I told you last week you let her walk all over you and I thought you shouldn’t do that. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t telling you to break up with her, but she’s a manipulative bitch.” “Yeah, she is.” I agreed with a sigh, glad to be rid of her. Brandon just stared at me. “Who are you and what have you done with the real Brian Breckenridge?” Brandon asked with wide eyes. “If I’d called her a bitch last week you’d have stomped me into the ground.” “That was last week.” I replied with a shrug, unnerved by the question. Once again Davey Jones was right. You might think it would be easy to pass yourself off as a younger version of the same person, but it was really difficult. “Yeah, well, you want to grab some food from the cafeteria?” Brandon asked. “I’m starving.” “How much time do we have left?” I asked. “Just over a half-hour.” Brandon replied after looking at his watch. “How about fast food?” I suggested. “McDonalds?” Brandon suggested and I nodded. There was one about ten minutes from here, which would let us get there and actually eat if we hurried, although the idea of snarfing down food that quickly would have been impossible for me before I came back in time, I could remember doing that several times in my first youth. “Isn’t that David?” Brandon asked as we waited at the counter for our order. “Who?” I asked and Brandon nodded his head towards one of the guys working behind the counter. Even with his back to me I could recognize the man I loved. Why was he here, wearing that god-awful polyester uniform and serving up food at the McDonald’s drive-thru? “David Jones.” Brandon said. “You were just trying to talk to him this morning when you were supposed to be picking up your girlfriend.” “Ex-girlfriend.” I corrected him while trying to ponder why Davey was working here at this place. Sure, fast food was a good first job for many high school kids. But this was Davey Jones. He was so much better than this. This guy had saved the world several times, gotten his father from being a dead beat to the office of the President of the United States! Hell, Davey had spent five years as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom for Christ sake! “Yeah, ex and all that.” Brandon said as he chuckled again and shook his head slightly. Our order was done and we went to sit down all without Davey having noticed us. As Brandon chatted about the upcoming baseball season and I grunted a few responses, my mind spun around the fact that Davey was here working on what should have been his lunch hour at school. That bugged me more than I wanted to admit. I could remember Davey talking about his life in the original timeline, and maybe once he’d mentioned working at a fast food restaurant, but that had been lifetimes ago for him. It wasn’t as important to who he was when I’d known him as things like the timeline where he and I hadn’t been a couple until that one kiss right before I was killed at the beginning of World War Three. “Dude, you okay?” Brandon asked. “You know, if you get on your knees and beg, Marcie might take you back still.” “Screw that.” I snorted and Brandon smiled. “Good, can’t say she was my favorite person.” Brandon shuddered in mock disgust and I laughed. “You done?” “Yeah, let’s go before we’re late.” I said. “No worries, we have German, remember?” Brandon was chuckling now. “Frau Hostetter thinks you’re the sweetest thing on earth and would never give you a tardy, even if you showed up five minutes before the end of the period.” “Well, let’s not push her today.” I suggested as we got up and threw our garbage away. “With the way things are going she might be having a bad day and decide I’m the sourest thing on earth.” “Yeah, well that’s what Marcie said after you splooged in her mouth.” Brandon laughed as we went out the door. That shocked me and I stared at him. He realized I wasn’t walking with him anymore and turned to face me with a frown. “Oh c’mon, you know that Marcie tells Katie everything. It shouldn’t be a surprise that I’ve heard about the blowjobs you’ve been getting from Marcie for the past eight months, or about you fucking her last week. She’s not a virgin by the way. She was just saying that to make you think it was something special. She told Katie one time that she’d get you to fuck her and then she’d be set for life, something about getting you to sell an apartment you inherited and then using that to buy a house for her and…” “What the fuck.” I snarled as the conversation with my father about selling Uncle Rich’s apartment came to mind. Could my younger self of this time line have been so fucking blind as to let a bitch use him like that? Then something else struck me. “Damn it Brandon, aren’t you supposed to a fucking friend?” “What?” Brandon asked, obviously seeing my face go red with anger and my hands ball up into fists. “Calm down, Brian.” “Calm down?” I fumed. “You knew the bitch was fucking using me like this and you fucking wait to tell me until I’ve broken up with her? What would have happened if I hadn’t broken up with her? Huh? Would you have stood beside me as my best man at the fucking wedding and fucking smiled while she took me for all she could? Is that how good of a friend you are?” “Dude, public place!” Brandon said in a half-whisper, half-shout. Sure, people were looking, but at the moment I didn’t care. “So god damn what!” I shouted. “Tell me, do you think you’re a good friend when you don’t tell me a bitch is sinking her claws into me and taking what’s mine?” “Would you have fucking listened?” Brandon shouted back, his face going darker with his own rage. “You were all wrapped around her finger. She had her hand on your fucking cock and was leading you around by it with your eyes all glazed over and your tongue hanging out of your fucking mouth! Hell, the only reason Trevor or I ever saw you was when she let you ‘play with the boys!’ You might as well have already been married to her! Trevor tried to warn you one time months ago and you didn’t talk to him for two weeks!” “Okay, you’ve got a point.” I said as Brandon’s words deflated the ballooning anger I was feeling. He did a double-take before his body-posture relaxed slightly. “Sorry.” “So am I, but you’re better off without her.” Brandon said. “There’s plenty of better girls out there, you know.” “I know.” I said as I headed for the car. I waited until we got inside before deciding to drop a bombshell on him. This should be pretty safe, after all Davey had told me that it had been pretty constant in all the timelines. As I started the car I turned to leer at him. “Who knows, maybe I’ll give guys a chance instead of dealing with bitchy women.” “Dude, not even funny.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “As many fags as you’ve beaten up over the years, none of them would think anything except that you were going to stick them in a trash can again.” “Well, there’s always you or Trevor.” I said as I backed the car out and headed back to school. “I ain’t a fag, and neither is Trevor.” Brandon said with a hint of fear in his voice. A quick glance showed that his face was white, not red with anger. “Trevor’s not a fag, he’s bisexual.” I said. “What?” Brandon squeaked and I had to resist the urge to laugh. Suddenly I understood something about Davey, far too late to share with him. Well maybe I could share it with him in a few months, or years, although it wouldn’t be exactly the same Davey. God how he must have loved doing this, letting little tidbits drop to his friends about the future, tweaking their noses with knowledge about them there was no way he should have known. It was fun! “Please, surely you don’t think I had no idea what’s been going on in Trevor’s barn, do you?” My voice was dripping with sarcasm as the anger of earlier leaked out. That was another thing Davey had mentioned but I hadn’t understood until now. Our bodies impacted how we behaved, and the younger body of mine had a whole lot more hormones and stuff floating around in it than the body I’d left in the last timeline. As a result, I was reacting more from emotions than calm, cool, collected planned words. “Uh, I, uh…dude.” Brandon stuttered and the last word was more whisper than anything else. As I pulled into the parking lot, his face was as white as it could be and I decided to take pity on him. “Let’s talk later.” I said with a soft smile. “Maybe during P.E. if we can swing it? I’m still grounded so the old man expects me back home right after school.” “Uh, yeah, sure.” Brandon said weakly as we got out of the car. He didn’t even look at me and I began to regret what I’d done. The difference in perspective was striking, between being openly gay as an adult and in the boiling cauldron that was a high school. I should have realized that, but I’d been caught up in the moment. Now it was too late to undo what I’d done, unless I somehow managed to put together a time machine, but that was an impossibility. It was just after Algebra II that a thin brown-haired girl wearing a skimpy top and very tight jeans accosted me. She had a bright smile on her face and was trying to simper like Joan Collins from Dynasty, but it wasn’t working on me as she stood in my way. Her name flowed up from long-forgotten memories of another time. “What is it, Laurie?” I asked her after she hadn’t spoken but stayed in my way. “Is it true?” She asked. “Did Marcie really dump you?” “I hope so.” I said before I could catch the words from forming on my lips. Her smile grew brighter. “So you could like, ask someone else out now?” She asked with a perkiness that was altogether too fake for me. “I’m grounded by my parents thanks to her.” I answered, barely registering the pouty expression on her face before stepping around her and heading to my locker. I passed Marcie in the hallway and got a glare from her as she saw me, but that didn’t stop her from storming over to me. “I need to get my things from your locker, asshole.” She demanded in a voice that cut over the buzz of students passing by us in the crowded hallways. “Fine, I’ll put them in a box and have Katie give them to you.” I replied and she started to say something but I moved off too quickly for her. The whole situation felt weird, like a page out of someone else’s life, which it was in a very real way. Davey and I should have been a couple for two years now. It was time for P.E. and for me to have my ‘chat’ with Brandon, and probably Trevor. Both of them were giving me sharp looks as we changed for class, but when it came time to line up for roll call I received my first surprise. Coach Cole, who was the former Navy Master Chief I remembered from the last timeline was calling out roll and he called out Davey’s name twice before shaking his head and muttering to himself. This P.E. section was usually for guys who played on sports teams. It let us leave school earlier for away games, and also kept us from being as able to pick on the little guys. That was something I remembered clearly. I also remembered Davey telling me he hadn’t played sports in this original timeline after coming back to Downey, so why was he in this class? Another important question, since I’d just seen him at work during lunch was he skipping class in order to work? I remember he dropped out sometime this year, and he’d claimed it had begun when he needed to work more hours, but this was the first day of school after Winter Break. “Okay, we’re doing basketball today.” Coach Cole said. “Let’s get through the warm-ups and then we’ll divide you up into teams.” That effectively killed my plans to chat with Brandon and Trevor. They knew it as well and Brandon gave me a terse ‘after class’. Maybe I could get away with being a little bit late getting home. If not, well screw it, this was a little more important at the moment. Halfway through the period while I was taking a breather on the side of the court and Brandon was in the game, I got a chance to approach Master Chief Cole. He was watching the game and making some ticks on his clipboard. There were actually three games going on with the size of the class, but he was the teacher on our court. “Master Chief, can I ask you something?” I asked and he stared at me for a moment. “You planning on joining the NJROTC, Breckenridge?” Cole asked with a little bit of humor in his eyes. “I’ll be honest, we could use someone like you. Last semester there were barely enough kids to keep it going. Think you could convince your two buddies to join as well?” “I…uh…I’ll talk to them.” I stuttered with surprise. I’d forgotten how… pushy he could be about his NJROTC. I also remembered that Davey’s sister had been a big member of that group in the last timeline. Yeah, that would be good. “Good, we’re meeting tomorrow after school.” Cole said with a nod and I realized how easily he had drafted me. Oh well, I still remembered how to march just fine and all the other crap that went with his little club. Besides, it’d give me more time away from grounding. “What about when baseball starts?” I asked as another thought struck me. “You’re going out for the team this year?” He asked with surprise. “You skipped it last year.” “Yeah, well, Marcie and I broke up today.” I said with a shrug, deciding there were a lot of things I could blame the girlfriend for. “Hate to say it, but I think that’s a good thing.” Cole said with a shudder. He had my full agreement on that. “Anything else?” “Yeah, when you called out attendance, you shook your head at the fact that Davey Jones wasn’t here…” I let my voice trail off and he gave me a sharp look. “I didn’t know you were friends with him.” Cole answered after a moment of silence. “I…I’m not. Yet.” I answered honestly. “I knew him a bit back when we were freshmen and he played on the football team.” “He any good?” Cole asked and I had to think for a moment to how Davey described his football abilities in this timeline, not necessarily how it had been in ours. “He could be if he made the effort and had some help.” That answer should be accurate. “Well, he won’t be eligible to play anyway the way he’s going right now.” Cole said with a grimace and he gave me a long look. “Breckenridge, I don’t know why I’m going to tell you this because at the end of last year I’d pretty much written you off as a pussy-whipped boy without a brain of your own, but you strike me as having changed a bit over the break.” “More than you can imagine.” I muttered and almost regretted it when I realized he heard what I said. That got me a look of curiosity, but he shrugged it off when I didn’t offer anything. “So, your friend, Jones.” Cole said softly. “He pulled a ‘C’ in this class last semester because he was at the limits of excused absences already. His absence today makes him even with the number of excused absences for the entire year. If he misses three more days, or fifteen individual classes like he’s been doing, he’ll get expelled.” “For missing classes?” I asked with surprise and Cole nodded. “It’s in the student guide, Breckenridge.” Cole answered. “He got suspended two weeks before finals and I think he was happy about it. If he doesn’t turn his head around and start paying attention, he’ll be out the door and in alternative education by the end of the month. His mom’s probably getting a phone call personally from the principal right now.” “Oh.” I said, dumbstruck by the news. “It’s time for you to get back on the court.” Cole said, ending the conversation. I made a couple of stupid mistakes in the game, mostly because my mind was spinning with the news of Davey’s problems at school. Until now, I’d been thinking I had plenty of time, weeks or months to get to know him and encourage him to make some good changes, but now… now I knew I didn’t have that much time at all and I was still grounded. “Let’s go.” Brandon said fifteen minutes later as everyone else was milling about the locker room, getting ready to take showers. He and Trevor had just kept on their P.E. sweats as they met me at my locker. I just nodded and followed them out after putting my clothes into a gym back and looping it over my shoulder. There was a mess of people leaving, so we made our way to the baseball field’s dugout where they sat on the bench and stared at me while I leaned back against the metal bars on the field side. “So what’s this shit about you thinking we’re fags?” Trevor said with a frown after we’d all remained silent for a while. “I never said it like that.” I said defensively. “You’ve never used anything but fag or fudgepacker to talk about people like that.” Brandon pointed out. “Since when have you used anything else?” I shot back as a flash of anger welled up. A deep breath calmed it down. Damn it to hell, I was an adult, not a kid! “Look, let’s calm down here. We’ve been friends for half our lives already, right?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with his eyes squinting at me and his arms crossed. “Of course as soon as you and Marcie started going out it was like we ceased to exist unless you needed us for something with her.” “Then let me say I’m sorry about that.” I said with a frown. “I was stupid to let anyone, especially a bitch like that put our friendship in danger.” “You mean it, don’t you?” Brandon asked with his head cocked to the side and a look of surprise on his face. I nodded. “Fine, I accept your apology.” “As long as you don’t do the same thing with another bitch.” Trevor added with a hint of sulkiness. “You don’t have to worry about that, Trev.” I said with a smile and he smirked at me. “You really turning queer on us?” Trevor asked with a smirk. “If I was, I’d trust the two of you to be cool with it.” I said with a smile but they frowned at that. “I don’t know why you think…” Trevor started to protest while Brandon looked at the ground but I interrupted him. “You two started doing it with each other the summer before seventh grade, right?” I asked and they both looked up at me with shocked expressions. “Jesus, Trevor, your parents aren’t stupid people. Do you really think they missed you going out to the barn?” “They know?!” Trevor’s voice actually cracked at that. “They told you?” “No, but they’ve guessed.” I said with a shrug. “You know, they have to be cool about it if they haven’t said anything.” “Dude, your parents know.” Brandon’s voice was a hoarse whisper as Trevor shook his head. “I’m never going to be able to look them in the eyes again.” Trevor mumbled before looking up at me. “Dude, if you’ve known, why didn’t you ever say anything? I mean, I’m not really queer, you know, but I do like getting it where I can. I guess you could say I’m tri-sexual you know…I’ll try anything at least once…” “Yeah, okay.” I said with a nod and a smile. “Whatever works for you bro. It’s your business, not mine, okay?” “Yeah.” Trevor grunted. “Dude, you’ve always hated queers or anything smacking of stuff like that. What’s changed you?” “I can’t really say.” I said, not really wanting to lie to them, but neither did I want to tell them everything yet. They were different people than those I’d known for so long before. It would be smart to get to know them a little better. “I remember the first time I heard you say the word ‘fag’.” Brandon said softly, his eyes meeting mine after a long moment. “It was about this time of year during seventh grade. You came back from Christmas Break and you were like really pissed off. When I put a hand on your shoulder you told me ‘stop that fag shit’ and to leave you alone.” “I remember that.” Trevor said. “We thought you weren’t going to be friends with us anymore, but you started hanging out with us again later that month.” “My Uncle Rich died that Christmas.” I said with a heavy sigh. That was one story Davey had told clearly, how during his first time travel, what he called the second timeline, Uncle Rich had died as well only he’d been there that time. “I’ve never heard of him.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “I think I remember you talking about going to see him during the sixth grade.” Trevor said with a glazed look in his eyes as if he was trying to remember. “You never mentioned him again, though.” “My mom and dad always thought it was best if I didn’t mention my gay uncle at school.” Brian said, remembering that from his own childhood and guessing it applied here. “They weren’t ashamed of him, but they didn’t want me to get into fights when other kids said something bad about him if they knew I had a gay uncle.” “That makes sense.” Brandon snorted. “Yeah, well he died from AIDS that Christmas and I got a little angry.” I said, guessing from knowing how I would have reacted if my Uncle Rich had died. “Oh, shit, I’m sorry dude.” Brandon said as he stood and moved to put a hand on my shoulder. There were tears in my eyes as I realized that in this reality, I wouldn’t have Uncle Rich around like he’d been until I was in my sixties. Brandon ‘s hand stopped halfway to my shoulder, and he looked like he was afraid for a moment, but I solved that for him by reaching out and bringing him into a hug. A moment later Trevor joined us. “So this is what’s been bugging you ever since then?” Trevor asked softly. “Yeah.” I answered. “Sucks, don’t it?” “Yeah.” Brandon replied. “I know thinking about getting that fucking thing scares me shitless sometimes.” “That’s why you cover your stump before you hump.” I joked as the hug broke up and we all grinned at each other. “So did Marcie turn you off girls so much you’re going to do guys now?” Brandon asked. “I think you should keep it quiet if you, you know. I’m not about to have everyone think my best friend’s a fag.” “Is that why you went after that Jones guy this morning?” Trevor asked with a thoughtful look on his face. “I mean, I’m not sure how you’d know that he and I did the deed last semester, but he does have a pretty hot mouth.” “Dude!” Brandon laughed. “I had him give me a blow job freshman year. You remember when he was on crutches after Ruiz tackled him in practice? The day after Brian and Jay Collins threw that kid who had freckles all over his body into the trash can, my mom gave him a ride home and I stayed there for most of the night. He blew me while I laid back on his waterbed. It was pretty good.” Their words, each and every one of them struck home as I listened and tears came to my eyes again. My Davey… we’d been virgins that first time, or at least he’d physically been a virgin. I knew in his first life we’d never ended up with each other, but I’d never thought he’d have done it with… our friends. Had he secretly looked at them while we were dating and remembered what he’d done with them? “Brian?” Trevor’s voice got my attention. “You okay bud? That didn’t gross you out did it? Or are you upset because you thought you’d be the first to bag Jones?” “Um, I’m fine.” I said after clearing my head with several deep breaths. No, it was as much my fault as anything Davey might have done. If I’d gone back further, to 1981, maybe, I could have stopped all this from happening. Instead, I had to deal with the world as it was now, and go from there. Davey had done all these, and probably more, in the original timeline and still ended up with me in the second, and had stayed faithful to me, except the time I rejected him. No, I couldn’t let what I’d just heard poison my love for him. He had told me once that a lot of the things he went through as a late teenager, after his father’s arrest had made him the man he was when he went back in time. I couldn’t begrudge those experiences altogether, could I, if they had produced the man who’d made me so happy for so many years? “So, what now?” Brandon asked in worried tone as he looked at me. “I mean, Brian, you’ve been a good friend, but what does this mean?” “Who knows?” I asked in a voice almost as soft. “As far as I’m concerned, the rest of the world doesn’t need to know our business, right? We’re friends, good friends, and what we share with each other doesn’t go no further, right?” “Right.” Brandon and Trevor said in unison. “Now I have to go.” I said with a smile. “I’m already supposed to be home and I’m still grounded.” “See ya tomorrow, Bri.” Trevor said, patting me on the back as I took off from the dugout and headed back out to the car. It was as I was driving off that the location of our talk triggered a memory of another talk, and the things that had been said. Almost, I turned around to tell my friends the rest of the story, remembering Sean, but I didn’t. There was too much else going on right now. Chapter 3 “Your mother says that you were twenty minutes late getting home today.” Dad said as we sat at the dinner table, eating honey-glazed chicken with rice and steamed vegetables. My mother’s cooking was something I’d really missed without realizing it as the years had gone by in the last timeline. There were plenty of times when I’d had a bad day and come home to make something like this, something that reminded me of being a kid, protected by my parents’ love. Davey always called it comfort food. “Yes, I was.” I admitted cautiously, unsure of where he was going from the neutral expression on his face. “You did well this weekend, Brian.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “I want to hear what you thought was a good enough reason to risk ruining that progress by being late today.” “I… it’s been an eventful day.” I answered honestly. They just frowned at me for a moment and I let out another sigh as I sat back, trying to meet both of their eyes while twiddling my fork around my plate. “Marcie and I broke up.” “You don’t seem too heartbroken.” Dad said while both of them struggled to not smile over the news. “I thought… I thought after the reason you were grounded that you were going to go on and marry her once you’re out of high school.” “No way in hell.” I growled, surprised at the vehemence that came with the thought. “Watch your language, son.” Mom said, but there was no anger or sharpness in her voice, and her lips were quivering upwards. “I can’t believe I ever dated someone like… her.” I said even more vehemently. They were both smiling openly now. “Why didn’t you stop me?” “We tried.” Dad said with a sigh, and although his lips quirked downward for a moment he didn’t sound too angry. “Was she pushing you to sell the apartment?” “Yes.” I admitted, shaking my head. “I’m just glad I woke up in time. That apartment… it’s all I really have left of Uncle Rich in this world, isn’t it?” “Brian!” Mom’s voice sounded shocked, but there was a very soft smile on her face and tears in her eyes. “That’s the first time in years that you’ve mentioned him without cursing or looking like you wanted to hit something!” “I’m sorry mom.” I said softly, apologizing for the behavior of the ‘me’ from this timeline. “I… well sorry doesn’t cut it… but I miss him too.” “I do too, honey.” Mom said sadly. “We knew you were hurting from losing him, but every time we reached out to you, you turned us away.” “But that’s in the past now, I think.” Dad said with a tone of approval and he looked me over. “I think you’ve done some growing, and while I don’t approve of what brought this all to a head, I do approve of the results so far. We can forgive you being late since you were dealing with breaking up from a bad relationship.” “Actually, that was dead before lunch was over.” I said with a snort, remembering how… angry the cow had been. “Then why were you late?” Dad asked patiently. “I… I was talking with Brandon and Trevor about things.” I answered honestly, hoping he wouldn’t ask too many details. “I haven’t been the best son to you over the last few years, and I haven’t been the best of friends to them either.” “Now that’s an even better reason to be twenty minutes late.” Dad said with a smile that surprised me. “So, what else is going on with you?” “Master Chief Cole’s expecting me to join his Sea Scouts this semester.” I began and they looked confused for a moment. “You mean Coach Cole from your football team?” Dad asked. “Yeah.” I confirmed. “They’re having problems getting enough students, and well he asked me to join and I’m thinking about it. I’d need permission obviously, and well, it would mean coming home later a couple times a week, and probably leaving a little early as well.” “Are you doing this to get out of being grounded?” Dad asked and I shook my head. “Grounding won’t last little more than a week while the Sea Scouts thing goes on all semester and maybe even next year.” I answered him and he shrugged. “Good, because if you’re going to do it, you’re doing it all semester.” Dad said while mom nodded her agreement. “Anything else?” “Yeah.” I said as I shifted in my seat and played with the remaining food on my plate a little bit more. Suddenly I wasn’t very hungry and I was wondering if I should even discuss this with them, but they were my parents and I knew they could always help. “What is it, Brian?” Mom asked with a slightly worried frown. “I saw someone I haven’t seen in a while.” I answered. “He went to La Loma with Brandon, Trevor and me and he played on the freshman football team with us before his family moved to Nevada. He’s back at Downey now, and well, I don’t know how to describe it, but he looked kind of down, you know?” “What’s his name?” Mom asked with a tilt of her blond head. “Davey Jones.” I answered and she creased her eyebrows. “That sounds so familiar.” Mom muttered while Dad frowned. “Was his father a preacher?” Dad asked and I knew he recognized the name. “Yes.” I answered and Dad sighed. “Honey, you remember the story from last year.” Dad said to Mom. “David Jones Sr. was a local pastor who moved out to Nevada until his wife found out he was molesting their daughter. He came back to California and pled guilty to the molesting and was placed on house arrest.” “That’s right and there was something in the paper yesterday about him being arrested for violating the terms of his parole.” Mom said as she slapped her hand on the table in triumph. “He went too close to a school or something like that. Funny, they never mentioned he had a son.” “Yeah, well, Davey, I don’t know.” I said softly. “He’s not the same as I remembered him, like he was all hunched in on himself. Plus, he’s working at a McDonald’s near school, and missing classes because of it. Coach Cole said if he doesn’t start going to all of his classes soon they’ll kick him to alternative education.” “What does this have to do with you?” Dad asked. “I… I feel like I’ve spent the last few years being selfish, you know?” I answered, trying to sound as young as possible instead of older, wiser. “I saw Davey today when all the stuff with Marcie was going down and well, I began to wonder. We kind of knew each other years ago, and he’s a pretty cool guy, but since he came back he’s all withdrawn. Before… without Marcie, I might have tried to be a friend and maybe he wouldn’t look so… defeated.” “What do you want from us?” Dad asked. “An extra two hours after school before I have to be home?” I asked and Dad’s face started to cloud over. It was time to speak quickly. “If you’re willing to give me an extra two hours, I think it would be fair to also extend my being grounded a week.” “Even if that means you can’t have a birthday party?” Mom asked. “Yeah.” I agreed. “What about the Sea Scouts thing?” Dad asked. “The afternoon stuff counts as part of the extra two hours?” I offered. “The morning stuff counts as school time?” “Deal.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Thanks for letting me bargain.” I said with a smile and he laughed. The rest of the evening passed pretty quickly with me spending most of it on homework. Assignments from the first day weren’t too bad, but there was a lot of little things I had to review from the last semester so I would be current on what was being taught. Towards the end of the evening, I watched the Cosby Show with my parents, experiencing déjà vu from watching the old program that was now being run for the first time in this timeline. All the while my mind was plotting out different ways to reach out to Davey in this timeline, the way he’d reached out to me. It would have been so much easier to just bump into him like we’d done on the bike path in my own timeline, but that was years ago even here. No, something else was required, and I had to remember something else Davey had said about how he’d been in this timeline. Very, very closeted. His sleeping with Brandon and Trevor, as well as several other guys most likely (and even one or two girls from what he’d told me one time) was all one-time affairs. Most of the people he slept with during high school he never talked to again, from what he told me. That was probably one of the reasons he wasn’t friends with Brandon or Trevor, because after having had sex with them, he actively kept them at arms-length. He’d never exactly explained why, but I guessed it had to do with him not wanting to admit he was gay. So long as he wasn’t faced with daily reminders of his ‘weakness’ in having slept with them, he was able to pretend like it never happened until the next time. That would fit something I’d heard from many gay men who’d grown up in the eighties. It was also something I’d have to help Davey overcome eventually. No, for now I’d have to work at just being his friend and nothing more. That night I dreamed about Davey, as might be expected. Only, the Davey I dreamed about was the man I’d grown old with. After his stroke, he’d lost control of his bodily functions and so it had been necessary to put an adult diaper on him when he came home. I think, more than anything else that had embarrassed him deeply. I’d seen it in his eyes, and the way he tried to protest every time I carefully removed a fouled diaper, cleaned him up, and then put a new one on him. Sometimes he’d close his eyes and stretch his head back as if pretending it wasn’t happening, and other times he’d look at me with eyes that provided a glimpse into his tortured soul. I knew Davey Jones and the proud man he’d been, and I knew how much his need for help with even the most basic of needs shamed him. That was why I would never let anyone else change him, and made sure the physical therapists got him to the point that he could sit on a toilet again. He still needed help transferring from the wheelchair to the toilet, and I still wiped his butt for him, but he no longer had to wear the diaper. Those were small victories, but each of them had helped rid his eyes of that shame, and restored to me the proud man I loved with all my heart. In my dream, though, the look in Davey’s eyes was the same, but his body was that of the teenager I’d seen the day before. The dream was still fresh and vivid in my mind as I showered the next morning and dressed in a nice blue and white striped shirt with a pair of nice stonewashed jeans. Yes, Davey had always had a great amount of pride, and I could well imagine how much of a beating it was taking right now. Way back in 2006 of the last timeline, a scandal had erupted just forty days before the mid-term elections. On of Davey’s Aunts, from his mother’s side, had been arrested in Las Vegas for a pyramid scheme and embezzling money from a property management company she worked for as a manager. It was only another scandal, this time on the Republican side, which had ended the relentless attacks on President Jones for the illegal acts of his sister-in-law. It was the closest to an outright scandal that they’d had to deal with, and I’d seen a look of hurt in Davey’s eyes. The night of the election, we’d both gotten drunk off our asses at our D.C. home and he’d told me how much he’d always hated that aunt. Apparently she’d caused countless problems for him in the original timeline, and was someone he actually despised. He’d also shared how awful his family had been in that timeline, which was now the timeline in which I was living. The mirror on the back of my door helped me to make sure that I was looking good today. I couldn’t help whistling as I grabbed my car keys and left my bedroom. Mom was in the kitchen, and Dad was at the table with a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I grabbed a glass of orange juice and the cereal mom had out on the counter and sat at the table to eat. “Good morning.” Dad said as I sat down. He put down his paper long enough to find another section and push it in my direction. “There’s something in there you might want to read.” “Why do I have the feeling it’s not going to be good?” I asked rhetorically. It was the Metro section of the Modesto Bee, and below the fold it had a picture of David Jones, Sr. as well as a headline of “Former Pastor Released”. Davey’s father had been released from jail after it had been found that he’d not violated the terms of his parole. He was living with his mother, who lived a block from a school. The parole officer on his case had authorized him to live there, and he’d been on his way home from the neighborhood store when a police officer had arrested him. “Ah, crap.” I murmured, feeling sorry for Davey and his family for having to constantly go through this crap. The only reason the paper paid any attention to this was because Davey’s father had been a preacher. Then again, if something like this had happened in the last timeline, there would have been an even greater furor. “You still thinking of trying to be friends with him again?” Dad asked as I finished reading the paper and set it back down. “Yeah.” I said with certainty that was far firmer than he had any clue of it being. “This only makes me feel worse, you know? He’s been going through all this crap and I don’t see him hanging around other people at school. It must be pretty lonely.” “I’d imagine a lot of people wouldn’t want to be associated with someone whose father was in the papers for this kind of stuff.” Dad said and I nodded my agreement while chewing on some cereal. “I have to be off to work, but good luck.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. “Honey, you know you can invite him over anytime you want, even if you are grounded.” Mom said as I finished my cereal and took it back to the sink. “Are you sure?” I asked, surprised at how nice they were being. Then again, these were my parents, bleeding heart liberals, and I should have known better than to be surprised. It seems I’d forgotten just how caring they were. “Definitely.” Mom said with a smile. “I feel like I’ve got my old Brian back.” If she only knew. “There you are!” Marcie was not the sight I wanted to see this early in the morning on the front steps of the school. She was standing there with Brandon and Trevor, as well as their girlfriends Katie and Lisa, both friends of Marcie. Today Marcie was dressed in another mini-skirt, with a tube top barely covered by a jean jacket and more of that Madonna-style lace crap. She must have wasted at least ten bucks of make-up on her face as well, and I had to squelch the desire to tell her she was looking like a cheap whore. Instead I just approached the group while keeping an eye out for Davey. “Good morning.” I said in as neutral a tone as possible. “I wanted to talk to you.” Marcie said. “I’ve thought it over, and I’m willing to give you another chance if you apologize to me in front of our friends. You better make it good though if you want me to forgive you and take you back.” “You’re kidding, right?” I said as a laugh escaped my lips. She gave me a death-ray style glare while putting her hands on her hips. Oh my, she was not amused at all. “What the hell’s gotten into you?” She nearly screeched as one of her hands ended up waggling a finger in my face. “You’re like a totally different person! Don’t you remember how important you are to me? You need to treat me better.” “Shut up.” I growled as I slapped her waggling finger out of my eyesight. She seemed shocked enough by that, and her mouth flopped open. “You listen to me for a moment, woman. I’m not some toy you can play with when you feel like it, and I sure as hell am not about to spend the next forty years working my ass off so you can sit on a couch watching soap operas and eating bon-bons like Peggy Bundy! If you thought I was your meal ticket to an easy fucking life, you sure as hell should have treated me better than you have been. As for taking you back, you can apologize all you want but I want nothing more to do with you!” “Fuck you!” She yelled. Her face had been getting redder and redder as I yelled, and I was relieved that was all she had to say before she stomped into the school. Katie and Lisa followed her, and I was left with my two friends, who were both staring at me like I’d gone crazy. “What?” I snapped at them and relaxed as Trevor started to snigger. “Dude, that picture you painted of her on the couch… that’s fucking classic!” Trevor said around his sniggers. “Just one thing, who is Peggy Bundy?” Brandon asked as he started to chuckle. “Oh, yeah, um just somebody I made up.” I said with a shrug. Damn that was right, Married with Children wasn’t on television yet. Oh well, it still worked to drive her off and make sure she had no illusions that it was still possible to get back with me. Several dozen people must have heard me yelling at her. “Dude, you know she’s going to be a bitch for the next few weeks, don’t ya?” Trevor asked and I nodded. “So will our girlfriends.” Brandon said. “We might have to join you in exploring the dark side.” “Your choice, dude.” I replied with an easy smile. “The only thing is, I think both of you have already been there a lot more than me.” “Let’s head inside.” Trevor said and we followed him into the school. The girls weren’t in sight and I sighed with relief as we headed to our lockers. Both of theirs were near each other while mine was in another hallway. To my surprise, Davey was there, just a few feet down from Trevor’s. “Hey Jones.” Trevor called out. “Hey.” Davey said cautiously, his eyes glancing to the three of us. “Hey, I heard your dad was in the paper the other day.” Brandon said in a teasing tone and rage surged through me as I saw Davey turn white before looking away in shame. He slammed his locker shut and started to turn at the same moment I swung out with my arm and elbowed Brandon so hard he flew against the lockers with a loud clatter. As I faced Brandon and used my forearm to pin him against the lockers, I noticed Davey turning back to look at what was going on. “Dude, that is so fucking uncool!” I nearly shouted as my face flushed with my anger. Brandon had a surprised look on his face, as did Trevor. From this position I couldn’t see Davey, but that wasn’t important. “What?” Brandon gasped out. “How could you be so fucking mean?” I asked, surprised at the way I was cussing. It wasn’t something I’d done much of in the last few decades. “Mean?” Brandon gasped as I relaxed a bit and removed my arm from his throat. He straightened up a bit, grimacing as he stretched his back. “Dude, those fucking locks probably left a mark on my back! What the fuck did you do that for?” “You fucking pissed me off.” I fumed. “How the fuck could you do that to someone?” “Do what?” Brandon asked. “What you said to Davey.” I reminded him and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I just mentioned the article about his father.” Brandon stated. “What’s the big deal?” “How the hell would you feel if your family’s business was plastered all over the paper?” I asked him and Brandon looked like he didn’t understand. Neither did Trevor for that matter. “Dude, what the fuck’s gotten into you?” Trevor asked, moving to stand next to Brandon. I took a quick look around in time to see Davey’s back as he disappeared around a corner, while there were several other students watching us in the quickly filling corridor. “Think about what it must be like from his perspective.” I urged my two friends in a hoarse whisper. “Imagine if it was your father in the paper like that and everyone around you knowing the shit that was going on in your family.” “My father would never have done something like that.” Trevor snorted. “Mine either.” Brandon said with disdain. “Besides, if he’s going to go all sensitive every time someone mentions his father he’s going to have a lot of bad times before he graduates.” “Especially with idiots like you around.” I said furiously, ignoring the look of hurt on Brandon’s face as I spun around and stalked down the hallways towards my locker. My mind was spinning with a lot of thoughts, but most of them centered around Brandon and Trevor. They had been our best friends growing up, always there with us, always supportive and strong. How much of that had been because of Davey’s influence on us? Sean’s as well, but I had to wonder just how much of what I viewed as our moral strength during high school had been because of the influence of the two time travelers? How much change could I make in my friends who were currently stereotypical high school jocks more interested in the next game and dipping their dick in a hole than in understanding people? By the time history class rolled around, I hadn’t come up with any definitive answers, but I did know that I would be staying away from Trevor and Brandon for a while. They’d been giving me odd looks all morning, and from the way their girlfriends were whispering to them in the hallways between classes, I was quite convinced they were being given some ultimatums. Up until I walked into the history classroom, I was ready to mark the day off as a complete failure. A question to a girl in my last class who also had this class had confirmed that there was no set seating assignment, so when I saw Davey sitting in a desk against the wall closest to the door, I took the seat behind him and immediately turned so my back was on the wall. He sat in his desk normally, and had hunched his shoulders as soon as I sat down. The teacher was standing at the blackboard, writing something on the board while more students filed into the classroom. A thick-set geek with brown hair gave me a dirty look when he saw me sitting where I was, but didn’t say anything as he found another seat. “You ever wonder if George Lucas sat in one of these desks?” I asked of no one in particular, although I was facing the girl who had been in my last class. Ronna, that was her name, and if I remembered correctly she was a friend of Davey’s in this timeline as well as the one I came from. She’d been there when I first met Davey, well besides that baseball game. “Huh?” She asked. “You know, George Lucas.” I said, grateful that someone at least had responded. Davey was still hunched forward, but out of the corner of my eye I saw him shift slightly in his seat. “The guy who made Star Wars and American Graffiti.” “I know who he is.” Ronna said with a hint of scorn in her voice. “Why would he have sat in one of these desks and why wonder about it?” “These desks are old enough to have been here when he was.” I said with a snort and she actually giggled. Davey’s shoulders started to move like he was on the verge of laughing. He was wearing the same jean jacket as the day before, but the jeans he was wearing today looked to be in better condition, although he still had on the half-melted tennis shoes. “They probably were.” Ronna agreed with me. She had long, dark hair and was pretty. She was a little hefty, but not too badly overweight. “I knew someone who went to school with him.” Davey’s voice was almost inaudible, but he turned slightly in his seat to look at Ronna and then me. His face was devoid of any expression, as if he was afraid of what would happen if he showed something. “She lived on a ranch a couple miles down from my house back in Nevada. Her husband taught me how to ride a horse. She said she thought Lucas was nothing but a weird freak in school and now she wished she’d asked him out.” “I bet she does.” I said with a laugh and almost regretted it when he winced for a moment before a slow smile formed on his face. That was the moment the bell chose to ring and it was time for class. As the instructor turned around and I began to read the assignment on the board, I wondered just how the Brian of this timeline had ended up in a college-prep History course. Sure, some of the classes were college-prep, but not all of them were as they were when I had gone through high school. Whatever the reason, I was just glad that I was in the class with Davey as I turned to face forward in my seat. “On the board is the outline of your semester-long project.” Mr. Wansor said in a bored tone. “Be sure to write it down accurately as it will account for half your grade this semester. You may work on this individually or in pairs, but I warn you that if you choose to work with someone there will be no changing partners or going solo unless one of you dies. You will note that there are several due dates for this assignment, the first in just three weeks when you will turn in an outline of your project. Missing a deadline reduces that portion of the grade by one step. Each deadline counts for five percent of your grade on the project with your final presentation being ten percent. Instead of a written final in this class, you will give your project presentation. Now that you’ve written the assignment down, let’s open our textbooks to page thirteen and start with a discussion on the second Constitutional Congress.” The class was a typical one with the teacher trying to drag answers out of the students and getting monosyllabic answers instead of the erudite philosophy he probably dreamed about getting. Deep down I felt sorry for him, and halfway through class I raised my hand and gave him a five-minute answer to one of his questions. Then Ronna spoke up to argue about something I said, and to my surprise Davey responded to her statement by defending my point about the inclusion of slavery being necessary for that time and place, no matter how disgusting it was as an institution. That got Reggie, who I remembered from the football team involved when he called Davey a ‘racist’. Before I could defend Davey on that topic, Davey snorted and shook his head before shooting Reggie a look of contempt. “If you can’t listen to a white guy talking about the institution of slavery with honesty instead of bleating only about the horror of it, then maybe you should take a deep look at yourself.” Davey’s voice dripped with sarcasm that was so familiar I started to get hard. This was a glimpse of the Davey Jones I knew, cocksure to a fault, and full of derision for people whose viewpoints he disdained. Sure, Davey had hidden it a lot, but there had been more than a few times over the years that he’d unleashed it at people. His ambassadorial confirmation hearing had been one such event, when he verbally lashed out a freshman Republican Senator who was trying to make a name for herself. Davey had figuratively picked her up, spanked her bottom and sat her back down gently while extracting a promise from her that she’d behave like a grown up instead of a schoolyard bully trying to look good for the cameras. “Oh yeah?” Reggie said angrily. “I ain’t the one sittin’ here defending slavery.” “I am not defending slavery, as you would know if you bothered to really listen to what I’m saying.” Davey said. “Slavery was, and is, a horrible crime on the conscience of humanity. That doesn’t change the fact that if the founding fathers of this country had tried to get rid of it back then, there wouldn’t have been a United States today, nor a United States that would fight a bloody civil war during which the abolition of slavery would occur!” “I think that is enough for the moment.” Mr. Wansor ended the debate in a stern voice, but there was a smile on his face. The bell rang at that moment and Reggie was one of the first ones out of the classroom, giving Davey a glare as he left. Davey let out a long breath before picking up his books. As he stood, his shoulders slumped again and the breath of life that had filled him during class seemed to drain away with his exhalation. “Hey, Davey, wait a moment.” I called out as I picked up my own books and rushed out after him. He stopped long enough to turn around and glare at me for a moment. “It’s David.” He said in a low voice. “What?” I asked, confused for a moment. “My name, it’s David, not Davey.” He explained. “Oh, I thought…” I stammered. “What are you trying to do?” He asked, oblivious to the stream of people filling the hallway and trying to get past us. “Huh?” I asked although I had an idea what he was getting at with that question. “First this morning, and then you sit next to me in class using Ronna to strike up a conversation with me.” Davey said, showing me that no matter what had happened to him in this timeline, he was still as observant as ever, and as clever in figuring out why people were doing things. That was always one of his best gifts, being able to figure out people’s motivations with just a few words and some observations. “What kind of game are you playing with me? You’ve been in classes with me since the Seventh grade and have never shown this much interest in talking to me, not even when we played football together freshman year.” “I…” I wanted to tell him everything in that moment, but there was a little voice holding me back and it wasn’t just because we were in the middle of a crowded hallway with people all around us. “I’ve been thinking.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” He asked with a very familiar edge to his tone. Davey was getting angry. “It means I’ve kind of known you since seventh grade, except for when you were in Nevada, and I realized I really had never gotten to know you.” I started to explain in a wavering voice. His blue eyes were ice cold as he stared at me. “Why now?” Davey asked me angrily. “If you’re going to try to tell me it had nothing to do with that article, you’re crazy. I know you and your friends. You all love teasing people because of shit like that and if you think you can trick me…” “No!” I said vehemently, although my voice was barely more than a whisper. He must have seen how much I meant that because his head jerked back and he blinked. When he opened his eyes again, they were less angry, although he still had a wary look about him. “Then what?” He asked and I let out a long, slow breath. “I… when I saw that article, something inside me wondered what it would be like to be in your situation, with my family life spread out for everyone in the damn world to read.” I said quickly and as quietly as I dared to in the noise hallway. A guarded look filled his face now. “And?” He asked in a dangerous tone. “I kind of remembered that you were always a smart guy, and you seemed to be pretty cool when you were on the football team with us.” I said with a shrug. “You want to work together on the history project?” “Why would I want to work with you?” He said with a hint of sneer in his voice. That hurt, but I wasn’t going to show him how much it hurt. This was awful, I was standing here talking to the man I’d just spent some sixty-odd years living with as a husband, a partner, and now we were like strangers. No, we were strangers in more ways than one. I wanted my Davey, and it was only the look of love I’d seen in his eyes every night as I lifted him from his wheelchair and put him in our bed before crawling in and holding him tight that kept me from giving up at that moment. “Why are you here?” I asked and his eyes narrowed suddenly. “What do you mean?” Davey said as he switched from attack to defense. “Why are you here at Downey High?” I asked him, having remembered something very important. It had been at his mother’s graveside, and he was crying as he buried her yet again, but unlike other times he’d buried her, he was crying tears of joy and recollecting every time that she’d done something wonderful for him in all the timelines. There had been many things, and only a few about this, the original timeline, but there had been one very big thing she’d done for him, something he’d never really thanked her for until just before she had died in this timeline. “I…I live in the district…” He said defensively. “You know, in the articles it talks about your mother living in Ceres.” I said calmly, noting how his eyes widened. “Your sister, shouldn’t she be a freshman? Why isn’t she going to school here?” “That’s none of your business.” He said angrily and started to push past me, but I grabbed his arm and pulled him in close so I could whisper in his ear. “I think you came back because your friends from before are here.” I whispered quickly before he could pull away from my grasp on his arm. “You’re here because the people you went to elementary school, junior high, and freshman year are here. I heard your voice when you spoke about Nevada. You miss it a lot. Where did you go to school last year? You moved back here in November of 1984, but you didn’t come back to Downey until this school year. I bet you went to Ceres High, which is where your sister is going now.” “Shut up.” Davey whispered, but his tone was defeated and he didn’t bother trying to pull his arm out of my grip. His head was hanging down though, and I was willing to bet there were tears in his eyes. That made me feel bad, but it couldn’t be helped just yet. “What are you going to do?” “Why’d you come back here, to this school, Davey?” I asked him again, still just a whisper in his ear. “You know why.” He said and his shoulders heaved as he fought against a sob. “Tell me, please.” I almost begged. “I thought I had friends here.” He said bitterly. “Except for Ronna and Jeanette, though, there aren’t any here. While I played around at being somebody in Nevada, y’all moved on with your lives and I’m left in the fucking dust. There, you happy?” “No.” I said softly as I released his arm. He turned to look at me, and there were tears in his eyes, along with an angry glare that was fueled by confusion. “Then what?” He demanded in a low, angry voice. “You going to make me do your project for you like Ronna and Jeannette make me pay for their alcohol so they’ll hang around?” “No, we’re going to do this project together.” I told him with as mild an expression as I could put on my face. Oh, how I wanted to take him in my arms and wipe away those tears. “Let me tell you what I’ve been thinking. Your old man dragged you out to some backwater town in Nevada where he’d be a big preacher. I remember you in freshman football. As soon as your ankle healed from that bad tackle you were going to be back on the team and you had plenty of drive to get on second string, if not first. You had some friends, some decent friends here. Then you got dragged to bumfuck Nevada and had to start over.” “Are you a fucking mindreader?” Davey whispered with a look of shock replacing the anger on his face. “This town you lived in, was it big?” I asked and he shook his head. “Less than five hundred people in the entire fucking town, maybe as many people in the entire county as go to this school.” Davey answered. Yeah, that fit what I remembered of him telling me. “So you went from being another fish in the pond to being the big fish in the little pond, right?” I asked and he nodded his head after staring at me for a long moment. “Now you’re back to being just another fish in the pond and you don’t even know all the fish anymore because they’ve changed just like you have, and to make matters worse your father’s in all the papers and not in a good way.” “You are freaky.” He said in a whisper and I smiled. “Yeah, but I’m thinking I’d like to get to know you.” I said with that smile still on my face and I could see something melt in him before his shoulders slumped again. “Why?” He asked. “Sounds like you’ve figured out my pathetic life.” “Because as I was thinking about this, I realized if I was in that situation I’d want someone to be friends with who just might understand what I was going through.” I said calmly and he gave me a guarded look. “I also realized that while I may not understand everything you’re going through, I do understand some of it and maybe I should try and make friends with you. Lord knows anyone who’s been through shit like you have has got to be someone worth knowing. I’d be wanting to slit my wrists about now.” “Who says I haven’t?” Davey asked sarcastically and my heart nearly stopped at that thought, but then he’d lived long enough in this timeline to make it to 2004 alive. “So, we going to work on the project together?” I asked him and he nodded after a very long moment where I held my breath. “Good, I’ll see you in P.E., right?” I asked him. “Yeah, but I go to work right after.” He said softly. “Okay, see ya, Davey.” I said with a smile and walked off, not daring to look backwards. Had I said too much, or not enough? Only time would tell. Chapter 4 “You have to admit it looks pretty queer even if people don’t know what you said to us last week.” Trevor said in a way that totally set me off. “What the fuck did you tell her?” I yelled at him. We were in the middle of the nearly deserted parking lot. Both Trevor and Brandon were facing me, their body posture defensive. P.E. had ended long ago, and I’d just finished the afternoon’s NJROTC meeting only to find my two ‘friends’ waiting for me by my car. Davey hadn’t even waited for the end of P.E. before heading back into the gym and changing into his regular clothes. His car wasn’t in the parking lot when I came out, which I’d pretty much suspected since I’d stayed longer in the shower trying to calm down. It had been such a wonderful day from the moment I’d woken up this morning. Turning seventeen wasn’t supposed to be that big of a deal. Seventeen was the year between when you could get your driver’s license, and the year that you legally became an adult. There was just something about it though, at least for me this time around. Not many people could say they’d turned seventeen twice in a lifetime. My parents had even relented on my ‘birthday party’. It was just going to be a few friends, and of course my parents, but Davey would be there. He’d even asked for the night off of work, something he was really reticent to do, but he’d done it and that made me happy beyond belief. Davey had met me at the library after school twice now to work on our history project, and was starting to unwind a little around me. He’d been surprised when I asked him to come to my birthday party, protesting that he had to work. Money was tight for him, and he was working at three different McDonald’s restaurants in order to make his car payments, his insurance payments, and still have money for things like food and gas. His mother wasn’t working now because her back pain was so bad, and there were still the payments for his sister to go see a psychologist. The state had stopped paying for them, and his Nanny didn’t have the money for them since she was helping Davey’s mom by giving them a place to live, buying groceries, and helping to pay for the surgery Davey’s mom was going to have in a few weeks. Still, he was taking the night off so he could go to my birthday party. “Nothing about that stuff.” Brandon broke into the argument with his own angry look. “She’s just hurt, Brian, and she’s lashing out. Marcie thought you loved her and you just turned around and dumped her like that.” “Last week she said she dumped me.” I groused. “Yeah, well she’s a girl.” Brandon said with a sigh. “We’re not getting it any easier, you know. Our girlfriends are upset because she’s upset and they’re digging for why you won’t just apologize to Marcie so it’s all over. Add on that you’re now hanging around Davey and some of his freaky friends and everyone’s wondering. Reggie’s pissed at him because he’s a racist…” “He’s not a fucking racist.” I growled. “Reggie’s blowing things out of proportion just like Marcie is doing. How about his faggot comment in P.E.? That wasn’t exactly unbigoted, you know.” “Everyone hates queers, you know that.” Trevor said with a snort, earning a glare from me, but he didn’t say anything about my glare while Brandon looked off into the distance for a moment. “Look, it was you who said you were interested in Davey that way, and pretty soon people are going to figure it out. We don’t have to say anything. They’ll just assume you two are faggy on each other and go from there. You’re not acting at all like yourself, Brian, and you know that damn well.” “Well maybe I just fucking woke up and realized I wanted to be better than I’d been.” I snarled while resisting the urge to lash out at them. What made me really sick is that all these little popularity games in high school didn’t really end after graduation. They just changed, and grew more vicious. Kind of like the difference between playing poker with pennies and playing high stakes poker with a million dollars on the table. I’d lived in Washington D.C. for far too many decades to deny that the popularity games of high school were not reflective on the real world. “What the fuck was wrong with how you were before?” Brandon snorted. “I don’t know what’s going on in your head, Brian, but you better wake the fuck up. You’re doing that stupid Sea Scout thing, making friends with Jones and his freaky friends, and you’re totally ruining your reputation! Are you even going out for baseball this year?” “Of course I am.” I snarled. “Look, I just know I can be better than I’ve been lately.” “Don’t you remember what we promised each other back in seventh grade?” Trevor asked in a softer voice. “Yes, I remember.” I told him. “We decided we were going to be the baddest dudes in school and we’ve been that.” “Yeah, and now you’re fucking it up!” Trevor snarled. “Maybe I’m realizing there’s more than one way to be the best in our school.” I said angrily as I pushed past him and unlocked my car. “Brian.” Trevor said and then stopped as I got in the car and slammed the door. The engine started right up and I roared out of the parking lot, not caring if they got stung by loose gravel thrown up by my spinning tires. I was angry, as angry as I could ever remember being at my friends. Then again, they weren’t really my friends. I’d always known Davey had a positive affect on us in the last timeline, but this was just ridiculous. Brandon at least had always been more considerate of other people’s feelings while Trevor could be downright oblivious at times. Still, he’d never been so… arrogant before. I was relieved though when I pulled up in front of my house and saw Davey’s car out front. It was a Pontiac J2000; something I never even knew existed before. Still, there was no mistaking Davey’s car since the front-end was smashed up a bit. It wasn’t bad damage, just very noticeable. He’d had the accident just after midnight one weekend, having gotten off work late. He’d worked sixteen hours that day, he’d told me a couple days ago. Technically, it was a violation of the state’s child labor laws, but he got away with it because he’d only worked eight hour shifts at two different restaurants in town. That worried me, how he was working so much. It was taking away from his studies, and I knew now for a fact that most of the time he missed classes in school he was working because someone had gotten sick or quit and they’d called him to come in and work early. Then again, he was calling them every morning before he left for school to see if they needed the extra help. I parked my car behind his, leaving the driveway for my father and went inside the house. Davey hadn’t been over here before in this time line, but I knew my mother had been getting anxious to meet him so it was no surprise he was sitting in the dining room, having a soda while talking with my mother. “Brian, you’re home!” She said with a smile. “I found this young man here sitting out in his car waiting for you to get home, so I told him he had to come inside.” “Hi Mom, hi Davey.” I said with a smile while mom frowned. “Davey?” Mom asked. “Only Brian calls me that.” Davey said with a sigh. “Everyone else calls me David.” “Oh, I see.” Mom said with a curious little half-smile on her face. “Well, I’ll just let you two boys go do your thing while I finish getting things ready for Brian’s birthday party. Brian, did you know David’s birthday was last week? You boys are less than a week apart in age.” “Really?” I asked feigning surprise and wondering just how she’d managed to get that information out of Davey. I’d tried to get him to admit his birthday but he’d flat out told me it was none of my business. He was blushing now. “Yes, so now you’re going to have to go shopping with me so we can get him a nice present, even if it is after the fact.” Mom said before sailing out of the room. “You don’t have to do that.” Davey said softly. “Dude, forget the protests.” I said with a chuckle. “You’ve given Mom an excuse to go shopping and there’s no way in hell she’s going to give up a shopping trip just because you don’t want to be embarrassed.” “Oh.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “So…um…” “I’m sorry about P.E.” I said quickly and he shook his head. “Let’s not talk about that.” He said as he stood up. “I was wondering if you wanted to work on the history project. We’ve got the deadline for the outline coming up and I don’t want to drag your grade down by missing it.” “That sounds good.” I said. “Let me show you my room.” While we sat and debated different things for the history project, I couldn’t help but relax and feel like things were going better. Here, in my room where it was just the two of us, I could actually feel us growing closer. At school, Davey walked around with hunched shoulders, meekly flowing around the crowded hallways so he wouldn’t bump into people or bother them. If people wanted to talk or interact with him, they had to dig deep to get a reaction and it took a lot more effort than most high school students were willing to give. Yesterday, a guy whose first name I knew was Todd had stopped me in the hallway to say he’d seen Davey actually talking to me and how he thought that was ‘cool’. “I tried when he first showed up last semester, but it seemed like he always had something else he’d rather be doing.” Todd had said. “We were pretty cool in junior high, but he like totally disappeared freshman year.” The Davey I’d known in the previous timeline had decades of memories and experiences behind him and had been one of the most articulate and well-reasoned people I’d ever known. This Davey, the one sitting in my chair while I sat cross-legged on the edge of my bed, didn’t have those years of experience and memories to draw from. Despite that, while we talked about our history project, I was finding that he was just as articulate and well-reasoned. Sure, he wasn’t quite as able to pull up quotes and historical references, but he was the rough diamond that had become the well-polished diamond I’d known. A part of me wondered if that was how he’d seen me in all the different timelines as he’d gotten to know me again and again. “Boys.” Mom said as she knocked on my closed door. “Yes?” I called out and she opened the door just enough to stick her head inside. “Your dad called, Brian.” She said to me. “He’ll be home in about twenty minutes. We’ve got reservations for five o’clock at Marlucci’s so you boys should get ready. Davey, do you need to call anyone before you go to dinner with us?” “I…um…I can just go home.” Davey said hesitantly. “There’s no need for you to…” “Nonsense.” Mom said with a snort. “You’re coming to Brian’s party after, right?” “Yes.” Davey said slowly. “Good.” She stated with an emphatic nod of her head. “You’re here now and it makes no sense at all for you to go home only to come back later for the party. We made the reservations before Brian and Marcie broke up so you can just take her place.” “Thanks, mom.” I said while trying not to break out in laughter. Would she remember that line when Davey and I were finally a couple and came out to her? “Just remember you need to be wearing slacks and a nice shirt.” Mom said. “Oh.” Davey said a little crestfallen. “Don’t worry, we’re about the same size.” I said as Mom closed the door behind her. Sure, this Davey wasn’t nearly as in-shape as I was, and he had a bit of gut over his belt, but there should be something in my closet to fit him, and we spent the next ten minutes getting him into a pair of slacks that were a bit tight but still fit, and a dress shirt as well as a nice sweater. He was a little hesitant changing in front of me, and I frowned at the sight of the ragged underwear he had on, but we were dressed and ready to go by the time Dad arrived. Yes, I did notice the sly looks he gave me as I stripped down to my briefs before getting dressed. That was a good thing on all accounts, and I took extra time changing just so he would get a bit of a show. Yeah, I was going slowly with that aspect of our budding relationship, but there was no reason why I couldn’t show him what he’d get one day. Dinner was great, which wasn’t surprising since it was one of the best Italian restaurants in Modesto. Davey looked really uncomfortable at the start as we all perused the menus. He even tried ordering something relatively inexpensive, but I stepped in and talked him into ordering something a little higher up on the menu, something I knew he’d enjoy more. Dad and Mom both looked on with approval. As we all munched on mozzarella patties, my Dad started in on trying to draw Davey into conversation. He was subtle about it, first asking me questions about how school was going, how the NJROTC was going, and my plans for sports in the upcoming months. I’d played baseball every year since I was seven, except for skipping it last year, and he knew what I was planning on doing, but I knew he was getting me to talk first before he started asking Davey questions. “Well, what about you, David?” He asked Davey after I’d talked about my hopes that maybe this year Downey’s baseball team would win more games than we lost. “How is your semester going so far?” “It’s okay.” Davey said with a shrug as he quickly stuffed some cheese into his mouth and chewed while my father looked at him with a smile on his face. “Are you going to go out for any sports?” Dad asked him when he was done chewing. “Um, I can’t.” Davey said cautiously before taking a swallow of ice tea. “Oh, why not?” Dad asked him with a lift of his eyebrow. Like me, both my parents were blond but it was obvious I got my dark eyebrows from my father. “I have to work.” Davey said after a long pause and a glance at me. “Oh, that’s just too bad.” Mom said with a frown. “Young people should be able to enjoy their last few years of high school before they have to work.” “Yeah, well, my family needs the money.” Davey said with a shrug. “That’s right, Brian mentioned your mom was having major surgery in a few weeks.” Dad said and I hoped Davey wouldn’t get upset. He gave me a glance I couldn’t quite fathom, but he nodded at Dad’s statement. “Yes, they’re going to try to fix her back.” Davey said. “Nanny, that’s her mother, is paying for it so money’s really tight now.” “What’s wrong that they need to operate?” Mom asked. “Brian didn’t really give us too many details.” “Well, you see she’s had scoliosis since she was thirteen.” Davey said calmly. Apparently talking about his mother’s condition didn’t quite make him as uncomfortable as talking about his working. “They didn’t catch it until it was too late and after a really tough operation she ended up having a hump on her back. It means she gets tired easily and is always in a lot of pain. She also can’t breath that easily, so she gets winded pretty quickly. The surgery is supposed to help with that.” “What are they going to be doing?” Mom asked and Davey warmed up to the topic. “They’re going to break her ribs loose, reposition them and then reattach them to her sternum.” He answered, oblivious to the way Mom’s face went slightly white. “They’re also going to do something with her spine, help straighten it out some. She’ll still have that hump on her back, but it’ll be half the size it is now and she’ll have better lung capacity. The doctors say it should help her be able to work again. Right now she can’t stay on her feet more than a few hours without downing so many painkillers she goes loopy.” “Oh my, it sounds painful.” Mom said softly. “That’s what they say.” Davey agreed with her. “Mom’ll be in Children’s Hospital for at least a month while she recovers and then another four months recovering at home before she can expect to work again.” “Well, thank goodness for disability.” Dad said and Davey frowned. Dad saw it and reacted. “Don’t tell me they’re trying to not pay her disability.” “They’re saying it’s an elective surgery, not mandatory.” Davey answered. “Besides, we haven’t been back to California long enough for her to qualify since she’s only had one job and that was only for three months before the pain was too much for her.” “That’s just not right.” Mom said with a hint of anger in her voice. Davey looked surprised to hear that. “Don’t they understand she has a family to support?” “Yeah, well, we moved back in with my grandparents.” Davey said with a shrug. “It’s a little crowded with Shantill living there with her daughter, but Mom and Jenny share a room while Shantill sleeps in the middle bedroom. Nanny and Papa dote on her daughter, Whitney, and put her in the bed with them every night.” “Where do you sleep?” Mom asked, beating me to the question. “Papa converted the garage into a living room when they bought the house back in the sixties.” Davey answered. “So now you get it as your bedroom?” Dad asked with a smile. “Kind of.” Davey answered and I frowned. “My bed is behind the couch, and I’ve got a dresser I can use for my clothes, oh and I’ve managed to fit my stereo in next to the bed. As long as I wear headphones I can listen to it all I want, and Nanny and Papa usually go to bed after the 11 o’clock news so it’s not too bad. Plus, they make pretty good alarm clocks. They both get up around six in the morning and when they turn on the kitchen lights it’s even better than having an alarm clock. Papa put in these fluorescent lights over the dining table and when they turn them on in the morning they’re bright enough to wake me right up.” “I see.” Dad said slowly, and I could see the tightness around his eyes. This was… Davey had never mentioned this to me in our last lifetime. Maybe it was something he’d long forgotten, judging from the suddenly bitter expression on his face. The food arrived, saving him from further grilling by my parents for at least a few minutes.",

What do you say when the world is ending and your only option is what you promised to never do again? Chapter 1 “I’m way too old for this.” Sean muttered as they stood over the control console and the machine sputtered to life. He’d always been on the short side, and now in his eighties he begrudged every millimeter of height he lost with advancing age. My own hands were as wrinkled as his while I pushed the appropriate buttons on the computer console. The familiar sound of a magnetic resonance imager spinning to life filled the small room. “I can’t believe this specific machine has been used as a regular MRI for twenty years without anyone knowing it was really a time machine.” I muttered and Sean chortled softly before pushing another button and inserting the small flash drive into the correct slot. Five seconds later, the program was being loaded. “It’s always best to hide things in plain sight.” Sean muttered a very familiar mantra and I nodded my agreement. “The time bubble is now active. We’re safe as long as we remain in here.” “No one can come in?” I asked, although I already knew the answer. It was a sign of how nervous I really was. “You know that.” Sean smiled. “We’ve got plenty of power for what we need to do, but not much more than that. The bubble will keep people out, and it’ll keep the radiation out as well.” “That’s good or we might not live long enough to do this.” I said unnecessarily. We both knew the dirty bomb that had gone off thirty minutes ago was killing millions outside the bubble. That was why we’d been sent down here, on direct orders of the President. President David Jones Sr. had passed away many years ago, and while the man who currently held that office was of a different political party, the legacy of knowledge about time travel had been passed to the current President. Every President since Jones had known about the ability to go back in time, but none had given in to the temptation until now. “The program is uploaded.” Sean said with a hint of excitement. Both of our hands were shaking as our eyes met and I nodded. He typed in the execute command, and the machine on the other side of the room began to whir faster. There was no one inside it, but the components that sent a person’s memories back in time were active, sending out the program that Sean and Brandon had developed a decade ago. “It’s working.” Sean said as he nodded with his head towards the television in the corner. It had been showing static, but now it showed a newscaster talking about some report regarding the War on Terror. “That’s still going on?” “It should be over by now.” I muttered, shaking my head as Sean turned up the volume and we listened to the report about the forty-year old war. “The fucker died in bed?” Sean growled angrily. “How much time do we have before the bubble runs out of power?” I asked. “If we don’t use the machine to go back, we could survive in here longer than we have food or water.” Sean answered. “If we use the machine, it depends on how far back we go. The program worked, by the way.” “I figured that.” I answered with a gruff voice and a shake of my head. They were gone, my husband and partner, our sons, our grandkids were all erased along with every instance of time travel in the history of humanity. Our orders were not to go back, but to run the program, erase time travel and all the possible timelines it had created, and then shut down the machine so that we were erased as well. We would pass out of existence, and with us the knowledge of time travel would be gone forever, or at least until someone else invented it in the far future. “Any luck connecting to the Internet?” I asked and Sean started cussing. “All the wireless signals are encrypted and I can’t get around them.” He muttered. “They must use some type of system our timeline never invented.” “That’s a pain in the ass.” I agreed with his sentiments. We’d hoped to use the Internet to make sure this timeline was free from nuclear bombs, gas attacks, and all that crap. “I take it we’ve just got broadcast television, not cable or satellite?” “Just broadcast.” Sean muttered. “Let’s see what we can find.” I said, moving to change the channel. Eight hours later we were both thirsty and had to relieve ourselves in a corner of the room. It now smelled like urine, but we barely noticed based on the things we’d learned. “Amazing how much you can learn just from watching television.” Sean groused as he switched off the offending machine. “Israel nuked six years ago, and the United States held hostage by six ships in harbors of American cities, threatening to detonate nuclear bombs if we interfere.” “They were all wrong.” I muttered with a shake of my head. “The world wasn’t necessarily a better place without the interference of time travel.” “Plan B, then?” Sean asked and I nodded. “Do we have a choice?” I asked. “How much power do we have left?” “Enough to send one person to 1986 and that’s it.” Sean said after he looked at the display panel. “You know it’s not going to be easy. There won’t be any other time travelers now, just whichever of us goes back this time. Plus, we don’t know every little detail of this future or how to fix it.” “We know how to be in place when the time comes.” I answered with a heavy sigh. To be honest, I was looking forward to dying in my old age. My life had been a good one, and if not for this one last incident, I could have died a happy man without time travel messing up my life again. “You want to go, Sean?” “Don’t be an idiot.” Sean growled with a grimace. “I am plenty happy to die when the bubble collapses and leave you to carry the responsibility alone.” “Fine, let’s do it.” I muttered and Sean nodded once with a hint of understanding in his eyes. It took another hour for the preparation to be made and I was laying on the table waiting to be inserted into the machine. Sean was sticking a needle in my arm, injecting the drugs that would slow my brain function and highlight the necessary memories stored in my brain. Then the machine would scan them, record them, and send them back in time to my younger body. This would be different, because the program we’d run hours earlier had ‘jammed’ the signals of other time machines, effectively stopping the transmissions of earlier time travelers. The 1986 I was about to enter was pristine, unchanged by the meddling of other time travelers. Ronald Reagan was President, I lived in Modesto California and David Jones Sr. wasn’t a member of the President’s cabinet. He’d never be President either. So much would be gone, so much of the world I had loved for the past sixty years would be gone forever, and I’d have to build a new life with my love, who wouldn’t even be a friend in this original timeline. Would he remember me at all? Could I convince him he was better off with me than with where his life would lead otherwise? We’d have decades, well years, to try and make it work before anything would need to be done. The history of previous time travel taught that making big changes would only backfire, that small changes yielded the best results. Even with the dirty bomb that had gone off in Washington D.C., this last timeline had been the best of them all. For thirty years there had been a peace relatively unknown in the history of the world, and the history books of that timeline had credited President David Jones Sr. with forging that peace. It had only been bungling by several of the Presidents who took office after him that had created a situation where so many people had died in needless conflict. The old saying was that Pride Goeth Before the Fall, and the pride of the men and women in that office had been high, too high. As always, it had been the common people who had paid the price for the pride of their leaders, and at the last, even the leaders had seen their errors. “You ready?” Sean asked as the drug began to take effect. Really, kind of late for that question wasn’t it, but he knew what Sean was doing. He could die now, never having to go back in time, and Sean would remove his body from the table and go back himself. The burden could be placed squarely on Sean’s shoulders this time, instead of his, but he remembered how painful Sean’s teenage years had been in the original timeline, the timeline he was preparing to go back to, and he shook his head. Sean smiled with tears in his eyes as things began to go grey for me. “Thank you.” Those were the last words I heard as everything went black. How long things were black, I couldn’t tell, but eventually I was able to open my eyes. It was still dark, and I was on my back, in bed. It took a few minutes for me to stumble out of bed. My entire body felt different, moved different, and as I reached the light switch and my eyes squinted in the sudden brightness, I let out a sigh of relief. My vision was clear, no need for those damn glasses. The back of my hands were smooth, with no age spots or wrinkles, and when I ran them over my body, I could feel how tight and smooth it was as compared to my sixty-odd year old body I had just left. My room wasn’t that different than what I had expected and I let out a sigh of relief. Sure, there were difference, like the picture on my desk, but they weren’t shockingly strange. A glance at the clock showed that it was nearly time for me to be up anyway, so I opened my door and proceeded to the shower. It was good, being in my young body again, I decided as I finished the shower and let out a sigh of relief at the dirty deed I’d just finished along with my cleaning. The images of my husband in his youth had been fresh and clear in my mind as were the images and memories of our lives together. Fifty plus years had passed by in the last timeline, and we’d spent them with each other and our children and their children. That should be more than enough for most couples, and it had been, but now I was wondering what another fifty years would be like, and I had a wistful smile on my face as I wrapped the wet towel around my waist and exited the bathroom, only to run into my father. “Brian, what are you doing up?” He asked with surprise and I had to resist the urge to hug him right away. I was fairly sure that, even as good of a son as I was, my father wasn’t use to hugs from his sixteen-year-old son. He’d died ten years ago in the last timeline and I had missed him almost as much as I’d missed mom, who died five years later. “I thought I’d go for a run.” I answered and he gave me a look like I was half-crazy. “You’re still grounded, remember?” He had a warning tone in his voice and I winced. Grounded? What had I done to be grounded? “I don’t care if it was New Year’s Eve, coming home at six in the morning with alcohol on your breath and your girlfriend in the car with you is not behavior I expect from you.” “I… I’m sorry.” I said with shock. “You’re damn right you’re sorry, Brian.” My dad fumed as his anger started rising. Oh fuck, he was really mad. Then again, he had a right to be. I had been a father, and remembered Richie doing something like that when he’d been seventeen. We’d grounded the boy for two months. The thought of my son, who was dead and gone now, brought tears to my eyes. Dad looked at me with some surprise. “Are you progressing to fake tears now?” “No.” I said hoarsely. “No, I’m just… you’re right. I could have killed both of us driving after drinking, and you’re right, it wasn’t right to bring her here. I should have taken her home.” “Well, finally you’re showing some sense instead of talking back or giving me the cold shoulder.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Don’t think you’re un-grounded though. That stays; you’re grounded until your birthday. No car, no friends over, no girlfriends over, and no parties. When school starts, we’ll let you drive your car to school, but you have to come straight home.” “Can I at least go running in the mornings?” I asked. “I promise, I won’t use it to meet up with friends or anything, just go running, by myself.” “What if you just happen to run into a friend along the way?” Dad asked with a frown. “I’ll tell them hello and that my evil father grounded me and I can’t talk to them until school starts.” I said with a half-grin that I knew always softened him up. He actually laughed before giving me a strange look. “Son, I don’t know what happened overnight, but it’s like you finally grew the fuck up.” My dad said with a shake of his head. “I like this Brian a hell of a lot better than the one that told me I was an idiot before he went to bed.” “I’m sorry about that too.” I said, horrified that I would have ever said something like that to my father. He’d always been a good father, one I could tell anything to, or at least he had been in the last timeline. This man didn’t seem all that different than the one I’d known, so I had to wonder if it had been me that had been so different? “You can go for your run.” He said after looking into my eyes. “I don’t know what changed overnight, but I’m willing to trust you this much. Don’t screw it up.” “I won’t, dad.” I said, giving in to the urge to hug him. He looked surprised, but returned the hug after a moment. Then it was time to go back to my room, find a pair of sweats to put on, and to stretch. Old age had put an end to my daily runs with Davey, but we’d still gone for walks each and every day we were both home. Once he’d had his stroke and couldn’t walk anymore, I’d pushed him in his wheelchair around the park across the street from our home. In the last few months, he’d been able to speak a little bit and his constant announcements of how much he loved me had assured me that the stroke may have taken away a lot of things, but it hadn’t taken my Davey away from me. It was refreshingly cold outside as I began my run, and I almost considered going back for another sweatshirt. There was no need though as I began to sweat with the pace I started, trying to see just how my younger body reacted. Running was good not only for my body, but because it allowed me time to think about the situation I was now experiencing. I personally had no memories of this timeline. Everything I knew about it was from what I’d been told by Davey and by Sean. Fortunately, thanks to how time travel worked, I had perfect memories of those conversations. Rather unfortunately, neither of them had been entirely forthcoming about this timeline. Both of them viewed it as a ‘dark’ timeline for them personally and had been reluctant to share details. Still, there were some details that I did know and as I ran, I went over them carefully. All my life, I had known that I wasn’t nearly as smart as either Davey or Sean. They could take in any situation and find solutions to problems like it was no more difficult than breathing. In law school, I’d learned that I could also solve problems, but it took me longer. I had to do a lot of research, and have time to properly prepare what I learned. Then I had to take more time preparing my arguments, figuring out the counter-arguments, and then the counters to those counter-arguments. Davey could do it in the flash of an eye whereas I took hours and hours, but eventually I’d come up with the solution. Sometimes, when the solution required a lot of research and preparation, Davey would flounder while I eventually solved the riddle of the problem. That would be my greatest asset in this situation. I only had pieces of the puzzles that led to the problems off in the far-future in this timeline. For the closer future problems, such as how to win Davey over, I had less time and just as few pieces of the puzzle, but I did have time to think things through and find some solutions. Time was both my enemy and my ally now. President Jones was a key figure in figuring out how to win Davey in this timeline. Not in the sense he might have been if this was 1981, but in the sense of what was going on now. It was our junior year of high school, and Davey had given me several clues as to what was going on with him now. Just thinking about what he was going through made me stumble and lose my pace. Here, in this timeline, Davey and I had never really been friends. We were more like ‘friendly acquaintances’, to use his term, when we were in our freshman year of high school. He’d moved away that year, to a place called Eureka, Nevada. His sophomore year, he’d returned after his mother learned that his father in that timeline had sexually molested Jenny. The thought of President Jones being capable of doing such an evil thing caused me to shudder, and I resumed my earlier pace, enjoying the brisk winter chill, my foggy breath steaming out of me, and the heat being generated by my body as I continued to run. I knew that when they moved back to California, they’d lived with his Nanny, his maternal grandmother and he’d gone to Ceres High for the rest of his sophomore year. Then he’d gotten his mother to get him transferred to Downey for his junior year, the school I attended with our friends Trevor and Brandon. Sean, in this timeline, no longer attended the school because of his ultra-religious parents. Or did he? I could never quite remember that because Sean had never really been specific, nor had Davey. When Davey had gone back to Downey, he’d found we’d all moved on with our lives and didn’t really remember him. As a result, he’d pulled in on himself and sometime during the last half of his junior year, he’d quit going to school, gotten his GED and ended up graduating from Navy boot camp three months before the rest of us graduated from High School. There was much more I didn’t know. Where did he live? Would he still find me interesting? I knew he was already having sex, but then apparently so was I with my ‘girlfriend’, whoever that was in this timeline. Did the fact that we were both already sexually active make it impossible for him to love me the way he did before? No, those were personal insecurities that I’d always felt, and I refused to let them stop me from gaining the love of Davey Jones. Another question I’d have to deal with eventually is what do I tell Davey, and my other friends, about time travel? The secrets of how to build a time machine were dead and gone, and I didn’t know nearly enough to help build another one. Nor did I think we should. That thought made me stop for a bit, breathing heavily into the cold air as I pondered if I was being a hypocrite. I was thinking time travel should die forever, but I’d used it to correct a situation. No, I couldn’t lie to myself. I was far to old to shy away from the truth. Some part of me had known in that last world that Davey and I had never been a couple and I’d come back to change that. Back in the time bubble, I hadn’t even thought about it directly, but down deep I knew the great love of my life had never happened and I couldn’t stand to let things stay that way. The excuse about ‘fixing’ the events of this timeline forty-odd years from now was just that, an excuse, to do what I really wanted. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor’s voice surprised me and I turned to see my old friend jogging up the sidewalk towards me. He had a broad smile on his face and stopped when he reached me. “So, you tricked your old man into letting you out after all?” “No.” I answered a little more harshly than I intended. Some part of me had forgotten how handsome Trevor was at this age. His brown curly hair practically gleamed and while he was a good four inches shorter than me, his body was perfectly trim and in shape. “Sorry, but I promised him I wouldn’t use running as an excuse to get out of being grounded.” “Dude, what’s wrong with you?” Trevor snorted and gave me a look like I was crazy. “Nothing.” I said as I turned and started to head back to the house. “I’ll talk to you in school, Trevor.” “You’re insane!” Trevor shouted. “Did you forget I was supposed to take you to Missy’s?” “Tell her I’ll talk to her in school!” I shouted back. “She’s going to go apeshit!” Trevor shouted but I was far enough away that he didn’t bother trying to catch up. That had been another shock; that the me of this timeline had planned to sneak out just like this, but unlike me hadn’t intended on keeping his word to dad. What the fuck was wrong with this timeline? “You’re back.” Dad said as I walked through the front door. He was wearing an old pair of jeans and a t-shirt as if he was preparing to do some work around the house. I could hear Mom in the kitchen, probably fixing breakfast from the smells that were wafting around the house. “Yes.” I answered him and he nodded. “Your mother will have breakfast ready soon.” He said. “I’ll need your help in the garage after breakfast. The dryer’s squealing.” “It’s probably the motor belt.” I said and he just looked at me. “I’m going to take another shower, okay?” “That’s fine.” He said and I headed into my room. I noticed the pile of school books on the desk and wondered if I had homework left to do. In my own timeline I’d have been confident that I’d already done them, but there was a nagging bit of doubt in me that the “me” of this timeline would probably have just ignored them during the holiday break from school. As I showered for the second time this morning, I wondered what I would find when I went back to school. This should be the Saturday morning before school started, if the machine had worked the way it was supposed to in sending me back here. I could feel my heart racing as I thought about what I would find when I went to school. Would he be there? Would he be in any of my classes? For that matter, what classes would I have and in what time periods? “Good morning, honey.” My mom said as I entered the dining room where she’d already set three places for breakfast. It was nice seeing her so young again, and she smiled when I gave her a hug before sitting down. Dad just watched me in silence while we started eating. Part of me wanted some of the coffee they were both drinking, but I settled for the glass of orange juice to go with the waffles, sausage and eggs. I’d dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, similar to dad’s, so that I’d be ready to work with him as soon as breakfast was done. “Did you see anyone on your run?” Dad asked me after a few minutes of silence. “Yes, Trevor was running too.” I said calmly, watching him as he raised an eyebrow. “Is that why you came back so early?” He asked and I nodded. “I told him I was still grounded.” I informed him. “Good, because you are.” He said sternly and that killed all the remaining conversation until we’d finished eating. As I worked with him on the dryer, I knew things were not okay between him and I in this time, and I debated with myself on how to change that. In the end, I decided it would just take time. “Thanks for your help.” He said as we listened to the dryer run smoothly about an hour later. “No problem.” I replied. “Your homework done yet?” He asked me and I shook my head. “Well you have plenty of time today and tomorrow to work on it.” “Thanks.” I said, taking that as a dismissal and heading inside. After washing my hands, I went into my room and began to look through the books and notebooks scattered on my desk. Twenty-three minutes later I wasn’t a happy camper. The classes I was in at school weren’t what I expected. They weren’t exactly idiot-level courses, but they weren’t the advanced placement courses I’d taken in my own timeline. To make matters worse, the notebooks seemed to be filled with stupid notes between Trevor and I about the physical and mental attributes of girls in our classes. There weren’t even notes about our assignments. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. Giving up in disgust with myself, I got up and went to find one of my parents. “Hi mom.” I said as I found her in her sewing room. She at least smiled at me. “Hello Bri.” She said as she stopped the machine she was using to sew together a dress. “What is it?” “Is Dad here?” I asked. “No, he’s gone over the Marshall’s house for a bit.” She replied. “Oh, I was going to ask him if I could call Brandon.” I said with a sigh. “My notes aren’t clear about one of my assignments and I was going to see if he could help me out.” “Brandon’s not in any of your classes except P.E.” Mom said with a frown and a sharp look at me. “What are you trying to pull?” “I think he has one of my notebooks in his backpack.” I said while trying not to wince at that. “Your dad has your assignments listed from your teachers.” She informed me and this time I wanted to groan. “After your awful grades he got them from your instructors.” “Oh, then I don’t need to call someone.” I said softly. “Do you know where it is?” “Yes.” She said, giving me a sharp look. “You sure you still don’t need to make a call?” “Yeah, I just need the assignments.” I told her and she shook her head. “I almost believe you.” She said as she stood up and went into their bedroom. When she came out, she handed me two sheets of paper with all the assignments written on them. The bad news was that there was a lot listed there, but the good news was that the classes were so easy I’d be able to breeze right through them. “Thanks mom.” I said with a smile. “Don’t forget your father will want to look over them tomorrow.” She warned me and I just nodded. Several times during the youth of our last timeline, Davey had commented on how doing high school work again was both easy and difficult at the same time. For the first time I really understood what he’d meant when he said that. Math was easy, especially this basic algebra crap I was taking now. The English essay I had on a reading assignment was just as easy. The book was even an old favorite of mine in the last timeline, so I just had to skim through certain parts of it to make sure my recollections were correct. History was difficult. It wasn’t difficult because I didn’t remember what the importance of the Magna Carta was, but because most of the assignment was about the memorization of dates. Instead of asking why the provisions of habeus corpus were so groundbreaking, it asked how many of the King’s nobles participated in forcing him to sign the document and what year it was done. Bah! “You want some lunch, honey?” Mom asked several hours later as she poked her head in my door. Apparently I was not just doing assignments over the break, but make-up work to get my grades up a bit. They were barely enough to keep me eligible for sports, and if I was right in my guesses, that was all my younger self was caring about right now. Maybe there was some truth to what Davey and Sean had always said about this timeline. “That’d be nice, Mom.” I said with a smile. She came back a few minutes later with a ham sandwich that I ate while I continued doing math problems with one hand. For a while she just stood there watching me with a little smile on her face. Part of me wondered just how mean this timeline’s Brian had been to her. “How is the homework coming?” My dad asked from the doorway three hours later. “I’m halfway to being caught up.” I told him honestly. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to work out a bit, take a break, and then maybe work on the rest after dinner.” “How about we go out to a movie tonight and you finish up the rest tomorrow?” Dad offered and I raised my eyebrows in surprise. He smiled at me. “It’s been a while since we did anything as a family, and you’ve been working hard today.” “That’d be nice.” I said and he nodded before shutting the door behind him as he left. By Sunday night, the night before school started, I’d confirmed that my relations with my parents were strained at best. I wanted to curse the Brian of this timeline that had apparently made several bad decisions, but that was impossible. He was as gone as if he’d never existed. Now I just had to pick up the pieces of that life. By the end of the weekend, I felt that I had made a good start, although I almost ruined by starting to ask mom about Uncle Rich. He’d lived to the age of seventy-three in the last timeline, but I’d forgotten that he’d be dead of AIDS in this timeline. He’d died right before Christmas in 1981, and when Dad had brought up the idea of selling his apartment in San Francisco, I’d almost asked about him. Apparently the younger me had wanted to sell it, and they had been resisting doing that for the last few years. Now they’d relented and were ready to put it on the market. They were surprised by my ‘sudden change of mind’. “Here are your keys.” Dad said early on Monday morning, as I got ready for school. He was looking at my clothes with a hint of approval. I’d chosen my clothes carefully, picking a good pair of jeans, penny loafers, a dark blue V-neck sleeveless sweater, and a blue dress shirt under that. “Thanks, Dad.” I said as I took the keys to my re-built mustang. I’d only looked at the car so far, but I knew that Brian Breckenridge of any timeline would love to have that car. “Remember, you’re to come right home after school.” He reminded me sternly and I just nodded, hefting my backpack with all my books and completed homework assignments as I left the house. I’d already kissed mom goodbye for the day. The Downey High student parking lot was the same no matter the timeline, and I pulled into the first spot I found, glad that it wasn’t full yet. To my relief, Brandon and Trevor were waiting in the usual spot near the front entrance. Some things didn’t change, at least. “At least you dressed up for her, but where’s Missy?” Trevor asked after we nodded at each other. “What do you mean?” I asked him with a furrow of my eyebrows. “Dude, you fucking ditch her on Saturday after sneaking out from being grounded, and now you don’t even pick her up like you do every morning?” Trevor snorted. “You better get your ass to pick her up or she ain’t gonna put out for you again!” “Oh shit.” I muttered, turning back towards the parking lot before I realized I didn’t even know whom the girl was or where she lived. I started to turn around, but a familiar figure caught my eye as he passed by us on his way inside. His familiar blond hair was long and shaggy, looking like he’d not had it cut in the last few months. It was still that familiar shade of dirty blond though, and his crooked nose stuck out like it always did. I couldn’t see his eyes from this angle, but I took in the faded jean jacket, worn jeans with holes forming, and sneakers that looked like they’d been too close to a fire all with a single glance. He was also a little heftier than I remembered him ever being, but there was no mistaking him for anyone else in the world. “Hey, Davey!” I called out, leaving my two friends to follow the sixteen, almost seventeen, year old version of the man I loved more than life itself. He turned at the sound of his name, and looked at me as if he didn’t recognize me. That was like a knife through the gut, but I put a smile on my face anyway. Davey stood there, silently looking me up and down, and then at the hand I was now sticking out to him. “You’re Davey Jones, right? Didn’t you play on the freshman team before you moved out to…um…” “Nevada.” He answered in a very familiar bass and I wanted to sigh with relief as he took my hand and shook it. “Brian, right?” “Yeah, so you’re back in town, huh?” “Um, yeah, we moved back last year.” He said. “I’m in the same history class as you.” “Oh, um, well I kept on trying to remember where I knew you from and I just realized it was from freshman football.” I said quickly, wishing I was as good at him when it came to dancing with words on the spur of a moment. “Say, you remember Trevor and Brandon, don’t you?” “Yeah.” Davey said as I tried to steer him back towards them. He looked like he was struggling with wanting to leave and wanting to stay, but Trevor ruined the moment. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor called out. “You better hurry or your girlfriend is going to dump you!” “I’ll see you later.” Davey said as he turned and headed inside the school, hanging his head as he went. His shoulders were slumped forward as he walked, and I wondered what would make my Davey walk like that. I’d always known him to stand tall. Even after his stroke, his first struggle had been to hold his head upright and he’d fought and fought until he could hold his head high on his own. Yes, I realized as I turned to talk Brandon into going with me so I’d know where I was going, there were so many things to fix in the here and now. Chapter 2 It was the slap heard around the world, or at least around Downey High. By lunchtime, the entire school seemed to have heard about the scene in the parking lot that morning. Marcie had come flying out of a car, driven by her older brother and rounded on me as I was just unlocking the Mustang’s driver-side door. Hours later, I could still feel the sting of that slap, and wondered what the hell my younger self of this timeline had seen in her. Sure, she was good looking. Davey had often overlooked the fact that I was bisexual more than I was gay, but then he’d never had cause to doubt my love for him. Physically, I could see why I would be interested in Marcie, but her attitude left a lot to be desired. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” She’d yelled at me after slapping me. “First, you blow me off like I’m nothing on Saturday and then you don’t pick me up this morning, making me get a ride from my stupid brother! What’s going on with you, Brian?” “I’m grounded.” I’d growled at her and she’d laughed in this high, shrill tone, throwing her blond hair over her shoulder. She was dressed in this short mini-skirt and tight top that left little to the imagination. Yeah, she definitely had a good body, but everything else was the shits. “What the fuck is that supposed to matter?” She screamed. “Who cares if your idiot parents ground you? You’re supposed to care about me before anyone else, remember?” “Get a grip.” I’d growled, and had gotten another slap before she stormed off without saying another word. Brandon tried to hide his grin behind a hand, but he got a glare from me as I relocked my door and headed back towards the campus. At least now I wouldn’t be late for school. “Dude, you’re going to have to do a lot of making up to her.” Brandon sniggered and I pushed at him with my shoulder as we walked towards my locker. I just hoped the combination wouldn’t be any different than the one I remembered. It wasn’t, and I put my books away without saying another word. I’d have to break up with ‘Marcie’ before too long, but part of me was reticent to do that right away. Davey’s warnings about making too many rapid changes stuck in my head from the times we’d discussed these aspects of time travel. I didn’t want to end up in a mental institution or a government lab. “Did you forget you’re supposed to take me to lunch?” Marcie’s voice pulled me out of my reverie and I turned to look at her with a frown. Apparently I had the same lunch period as her, and she expected me to take her somewhere. Damn, there went my plans to ‘meet’ up with Davey for lunch. “No.” I answered her, trying to put a smile on my face. At that moment I had never missed my Davey so much. How the hell had I ended up with this bitch instead of the calm, loving man I had just spent seven decades of my life with? “Where do you want to go?” “The usual.” She said flatly. “Aren’t you tired of that place yet?” I asked, trying to get her to tell me exactly what ‘the usual’ meant. “No way in hell am I tired of that place.” She frowned. “Everyone sees us together there so they know you’re mine. I thought you liked that. You told me you did.” “Yeah, well, sometimes the food gets old.” I temporized and she frowned even more. “What’s the matter, Brian darling?” She asked in the most sickeningly sweet voice as she stepped up and put her hand on my chest. I wanted to shudder. “You haven’t even kissed me yet, and now you don’t want to go to Furnow’s for lunch?” “Sorry.” I said as I hugged her and planted a kiss on her cheek. A little voice in my head was yammering about this being a betrayal of Davey and it got louder when she tried to kiss me on the mouth. “Dude, you going to lunch?” Brandon’s voice saved me as I jerked my head to look at my friend. Marcie frowned. “Katie and I thought we might join you today.” “That would be good.” I said quickly, ignoring Marcie’s frown. Katie must be the black-haired girl that was with Brandon. She was petite, but had a fair-sized pair of breasts that looked quite confined in the low-necked blouse she was wearing. God, what was wrong with me and my friends that we were dating girls who thought it necessary to show all their assets? Marcie wasn’t happy about the company, but she looped her arm through mine and practically dragged me towards the parking lot. My dislike for her was getting to be extreme, and as I unlocked the passenger door for her, I debated on whether dumping her would be a ‘small’ change or a ‘big’ one. Davey had always said big changes were bad, but if dumping her was a big one, I might have to risk the consequences. Brandon and his girlfriend got in the back seat, and I had to keep a smirk off my face. Trevor and I were bisexual, although he leaned more towards girls as he got older, while Davey, Sean and Brandon had always been gay from everything I’d heard. Sure Brandon had dated, and had sex with girls in high school of the original timeline (according to Sean), but according to Davey, Brandon had come out in college and never looked back. As we were pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed Davey in a blue Pontiac behind us, and kept on eye on the rear-view mirror as he followed us out of the lot. He turned at the first light though, and I lost track of him. I’d learned that he was in my history class, but he had sat on the far side of the room from me and disappeared as soon as the bell rang. Well, there was plenty of time, I kept reminding myself. Still, it hurt seeing him so young again, and not being able to wrap my arms around him, kiss him, or to talk with him all night long. “BRIAN!” Marcie’s screech reminded me I was driving and I slammed on the brakes just in time to keep from slamming into a car that was stopped for a red light. “What’s the matter with you? You’ve been acting all weird since Saturday! Snap out of it!” “Shut up.” I growled at her, and she glared at me, accompanied by the noise of two people in the back seat sucking in their breath in surprise. “What did you say to me?” Marcie’s voice grew dangerously low as a honk from behind told me the light was green and I started driving again. “I’m not a doormat, you know.” I said with a hint of anger in my voice. “Who said you were?” She retorted angrily. “You do with the way you talk to me.” I replied, enjoying the surge of anger and the tingling it brought to my fingers. I’d forgotten how strong emotions were at this age, and it felt good. “I do not.” She huffed as she crossed her arms just below her bosom. “You better take that back right now if you want to keep my love.” “Stop being such a little girl.” I snorted as a fresh wave of anger came over him. I was too old to be dealing with shit like this. “How dare you say that to me?” She roared and made to move as if she was going to open the door. “If you’re going to jump out of the car you better wait until I can pull over.” I said as they pulled to a stop at another light. “Take me back to the school right now!” She demanded and I was only too happy to agree. I’d barely had time to stop the car in a parking spot at the student lot before she was out the door. She paused while waiting for Brandon’s girlfriend to get out. Katie was making sympathetic noises while Brandon and I got out and I waited for whatever was to come next. Once again I wished for the ability to easily deal with people that Davey had possessed, but that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. “What is wrong with you, Brian?” Marcie demanded angrily after stomping around the car and getting in my face. Spittle flew from her lips and landed on my face, but I resisted the urge to wipe it off. “Nothings wrong with me.” I answered after thinking for a moment. “I just don’t like being treated like a doormat.” “How long have we been going out?” She asked, and I froze, sparing a quick glance at Brandon but he didn’t know I needed his help. Her face grew even redder as the silence continued and she realized I couldn’t answer. “You mean you can’t even fucking remember we’ve been going out for nine months now! I gave you my virginity and you can’t tell me how long we’ve gone out but you can tell me you think I’m treating you like a doormat? Well, I got news for you, Brian Breckenridge. If this is the best you can do, you don’t deserve to be dating me!” She turned on her heels and stormed off, pulling Brandon’s girlfriend in her wake. Brandon leaned back against my car, shaking his head and obviously fighting a losing battle with an urge to laugh. More than a few students had seen the tail end of this show, but I wasn’t as concerned with that as I would have been if I was really sixteen, well sixteen going on seventeen real soon. “Dude, what the fuck is up with you?” Brandon asked after he got his laughter under control. Last week you’re all like ‘Oh, she’s the one, Brandon. I love her. We’re going to get married as soon as we’re out of high school!’ Now you’re like ‘you treat me like a doormat!’ What’s going on, bro?” “You don’t think she treats me like a doormat?” I asked and he chuckled. “Dude, something wrong with your memory?” Brandon asked with a shake of his head. “I told you last week you let her walk all over you and I thought you shouldn’t do that. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t telling you to break up with her, but she’s a manipulative bitch.” “Yeah, she is.” I agreed with a sigh, glad to be rid of her. Brandon just stared at me. “Who are you and what have you done with the real Brian Breckenridge?” Brandon asked with wide eyes. “If I’d called her a bitch last week you’d have stomped me into the ground.” “That was last week.” I replied with a shrug, unnerved by the question. Once again Davey Jones was right. You might think it would be easy to pass yourself off as a younger version of the same person, but it was really difficult. “Yeah, well, you want to grab some food from the cafeteria?” Brandon asked. “I’m starving.” “How much time do we have left?” I asked. “Just over a half-hour.” Brandon replied after looking at his watch. “How about fast food?” I suggested. “McDonalds?” Brandon suggested and I nodded. There was one about ten minutes from here, which would let us get there and actually eat if we hurried, although the idea of snarfing down food that quickly would have been impossible for me before I came back in time, I could remember doing that several times in my first youth. “Isn’t that David?” Brandon asked as we waited at the counter for our order. “Who?” I asked and Brandon nodded his head towards one of the guys working behind the counter. Even with his back to me I could recognize the man I loved. Why was he here, wearing that god-awful polyester uniform and serving up food at the McDonald’s drive-thru? “David Jones.” Brandon said. “You were just trying to talk to him this morning when you were supposed to be picking up your girlfriend.” “Ex-girlfriend.” I corrected him while trying to ponder why Davey was working here at this place. Sure, fast food was a good first job for many high school kids. But this was Davey Jones. He was so much better than this. This guy had saved the world several times, gotten his father from being a dead beat to the office of the President of the United States! Hell, Davey had spent five years as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom for Christ sake! “Yeah, ex and all that.” Brandon said as he chuckled again and shook his head slightly. Our order was done and we went to sit down all without Davey having noticed us. As Brandon chatted about the upcoming baseball season and I grunted a few responses, my mind spun around the fact that Davey was here working on what should have been his lunch hour at school. That bugged me more than I wanted to admit. I could remember Davey talking about his life in the original timeline, and maybe once he’d mentioned working at a fast food restaurant, but that had been lifetimes ago for him. It wasn’t as important to who he was when I’d known him as things like the timeline where he and I hadn’t been a couple until that one kiss right before I was killed at the beginning of World War Three. “Dude, you okay?” Brandon asked. “You know, if you get on your knees and beg, Marcie might take you back still.” “Screw that.” I snorted and Brandon smiled. “Good, can’t say she was my favorite person.” Brandon shuddered in mock disgust and I laughed. “You done?” “Yeah, let’s go before we’re late.” I said. “No worries, we have German, remember?” Brandon was chuckling now. “Frau Hostetter thinks you’re the sweetest thing on earth and would never give you a tardy, even if you showed up five minutes before the end of the period.” “Well, let’s not push her today.” I suggested as we got up and threw our garbage away. “With the way things are going she might be having a bad day and decide I’m the sourest thing on earth.” “Yeah, well that’s what Marcie said after you splooged in her mouth.” Brandon laughed as we went out the door. That shocked me and I stared at him. He realized I wasn’t walking with him anymore and turned to face me with a frown. “Oh c’mon, you know that Marcie tells Katie everything. It shouldn’t be a surprise that I’ve heard about the blowjobs you’ve been getting from Marcie for the past eight months, or about you fucking her last week. She’s not a virgin by the way. She was just saying that to make you think it was something special. She told Katie one time that she’d get you to fuck her and then she’d be set for life, something about getting you to sell an apartment you inherited and then using that to buy a house for her and…” “What the fuck.” I snarled as the conversation with my father about selling Uncle Rich’s apartment came to mind. Could my younger self of this time line have been so fucking blind as to let a bitch use him like that? Then something else struck me. “Damn it Brandon, aren’t you supposed to a fucking friend?” “What?” Brandon asked, obviously seeing my face go red with anger and my hands ball up into fists. “Calm down, Brian.” “Calm down?” I fumed. “You knew the bitch was fucking using me like this and you fucking wait to tell me until I’ve broken up with her? What would have happened if I hadn’t broken up with her? Huh? Would you have stood beside me as my best man at the fucking wedding and fucking smiled while she took me for all she could? Is that how good of a friend you are?” “Dude, public place!” Brandon said in a half-whisper, half-shout. Sure, people were looking, but at the moment I didn’t care. “So god damn what!” I shouted. “Tell me, do you think you’re a good friend when you don’t tell me a bitch is sinking her claws into me and taking what’s mine?” “Would you have fucking listened?” Brandon shouted back, his face going darker with his own rage. “You were all wrapped around her finger. She had her hand on your fucking cock and was leading you around by it with your eyes all glazed over and your tongue hanging out of your fucking mouth! Hell, the only reason Trevor or I ever saw you was when she let you ‘play with the boys!’ You might as well have already been married to her! Trevor tried to warn you one time months ago and you didn’t talk to him for two weeks!” “Okay, you’ve got a point.” I said as Brandon’s words deflated the ballooning anger I was feeling. He did a double-take before his body-posture relaxed slightly. “Sorry.” “So am I, but you’re better off without her.” Brandon said. “There’s plenty of better girls out there, you know.” “I know.” I said as I headed for the car. I waited until we got inside before deciding to drop a bombshell on him. This should be pretty safe, after all Davey had told me that it had been pretty constant in all the timelines. As I started the car I turned to leer at him. “Who knows, maybe I’ll give guys a chance instead of dealing with bitchy women.” “Dude, not even funny.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “As many fags as you’ve beaten up over the years, none of them would think anything except that you were going to stick them in a trash can again.” “Well, there’s always you or Trevor.” I said as I backed the car out and headed back to school. “I ain’t a fag, and neither is Trevor.” Brandon said with a hint of fear in his voice. A quick glance showed that his face was white, not red with anger. “Trevor’s not a fag, he’s bisexual.” I said. “What?” Brandon squeaked and I had to resist the urge to laugh. Suddenly I understood something about Davey, far too late to share with him. Well maybe I could share it with him in a few months, or years, although it wouldn’t be exactly the same Davey. God how he must have loved doing this, letting little tidbits drop to his friends about the future, tweaking their noses with knowledge about them there was no way he should have known. It was fun! “Please, surely you don’t think I had no idea what’s been going on in Trevor’s barn, do you?” My voice was dripping with sarcasm as the anger of earlier leaked out. That was another thing Davey had mentioned but I hadn’t understood until now. Our bodies impacted how we behaved, and the younger body of mine had a whole lot more hormones and stuff floating around in it than the body I’d left in the last timeline. As a result, I was reacting more from emotions than calm, cool, collected planned words. “Uh, I, uh…dude.” Brandon stuttered and the last word was more whisper than anything else. As I pulled into the parking lot, his face was as white as it could be and I decided to take pity on him. “Let’s talk later.” I said with a soft smile. “Maybe during P.E. if we can swing it? I’m still grounded so the old man expects me back home right after school.” “Uh, yeah, sure.” Brandon said weakly as we got out of the car. He didn’t even look at me and I began to regret what I’d done. The difference in perspective was striking, between being openly gay as an adult and in the boiling cauldron that was a high school. I should have realized that, but I’d been caught up in the moment. Now it was too late to undo what I’d done, unless I somehow managed to put together a time machine, but that was an impossibility. It was just after Algebra II that a thin brown-haired girl wearing a skimpy top and very tight jeans accosted me. She had a bright smile on her face and was trying to simper like Joan Collins from Dynasty, but it wasn’t working on me as she stood in my way. Her name flowed up from long-forgotten memories of another time. “What is it, Laurie?” I asked her after she hadn’t spoken but stayed in my way. “Is it true?” She asked. “Did Marcie really dump you?” “I hope so.” I said before I could catch the words from forming on my lips. Her smile grew brighter. “So you could like, ask someone else out now?” She asked with a perkiness that was altogether too fake for me. “I’m grounded by my parents thanks to her.” I answered, barely registering the pouty expression on her face before stepping around her and heading to my locker. I passed Marcie in the hallway and got a glare from her as she saw me, but that didn’t stop her from storming over to me. “I need to get my things from your locker, asshole.” She demanded in a voice that cut over the buzz of students passing by us in the crowded hallways. “Fine, I’ll put them in a box and have Katie give them to you.” I replied and she started to say something but I moved off too quickly for her. The whole situation felt weird, like a page out of someone else’s life, which it was in a very real way. Davey and I should have been a couple for two years now. It was time for P.E. and for me to have my ‘chat’ with Brandon, and probably Trevor. Both of them were giving me sharp looks as we changed for class, but when it came time to line up for roll call I received my first surprise. Coach Cole, who was the former Navy Master Chief I remembered from the last timeline was calling out roll and he called out Davey’s name twice before shaking his head and muttering to himself. This P.E. section was usually for guys who played on sports teams. It let us leave school earlier for away games, and also kept us from being as able to pick on the little guys. That was something I remembered clearly. I also remembered Davey telling me he hadn’t played sports in this original timeline after coming back to Downey, so why was he in this class? Another important question, since I’d just seen him at work during lunch was he skipping class in order to work? I remember he dropped out sometime this year, and he’d claimed it had begun when he needed to work more hours, but this was the first day of school after Winter Break. “Okay, we’re doing basketball today.” Coach Cole said. “Let’s get through the warm-ups and then we’ll divide you up into teams.” That effectively killed my plans to chat with Brandon and Trevor. They knew it as well and Brandon gave me a terse ‘after class’. Maybe I could get away with being a little bit late getting home. If not, well screw it, this was a little more important at the moment. Halfway through the period while I was taking a breather on the side of the court and Brandon was in the game, I got a chance to approach Master Chief Cole. He was watching the game and making some ticks on his clipboard. There were actually three games going on with the size of the class, but he was the teacher on our court. “Master Chief, can I ask you something?” I asked and he stared at me for a moment. “You planning on joining the NJROTC, Breckenridge?” Cole asked with a little bit of humor in his eyes. “I’ll be honest, we could use someone like you. Last semester there were barely enough kids to keep it going. Think you could convince your two buddies to join as well?” “I…uh…I’ll talk to them.” I stuttered with surprise. I’d forgotten how… pushy he could be about his NJROTC. I also remembered that Davey’s sister had been a big member of that group in the last timeline. Yeah, that would be good. “Good, we’re meeting tomorrow after school.” Cole said with a nod and I realized how easily he had drafted me. Oh well, I still remembered how to march just fine and all the other crap that went with his little club. Besides, it’d give me more time away from grounding. “What about when baseball starts?” I asked as another thought struck me. “You’re going out for the team this year?” He asked with surprise. “You skipped it last year.” “Yeah, well, Marcie and I broke up today.” I said with a shrug, deciding there were a lot of things I could blame the girlfriend for. “Hate to say it, but I think that’s a good thing.” Cole said with a shudder. He had my full agreement on that. “Anything else?” “Yeah, when you called out attendance, you shook your head at the fact that Davey Jones wasn’t here…” I let my voice trail off and he gave me a sharp look. “I didn’t know you were friends with him.” Cole answered after a moment of silence. “I…I’m not. Yet.” I answered honestly. “I knew him a bit back when we were freshmen and he played on the football team.” “He any good?” Cole asked and I had to think for a moment to how Davey described his football abilities in this timeline, not necessarily how it had been in ours. “He could be if he made the effort and had some help.” That answer should be accurate. “Well, he won’t be eligible to play anyway the way he’s going right now.” Cole said with a grimace and he gave me a long look. “Breckenridge, I don’t know why I’m going to tell you this because at the end of last year I’d pretty much written you off as a pussy-whipped boy without a brain of your own, but you strike me as having changed a bit over the break.” “More than you can imagine.” I muttered and almost regretted it when I realized he heard what I said. That got me a look of curiosity, but he shrugged it off when I didn’t offer anything. “So, your friend, Jones.” Cole said softly. “He pulled a ‘C’ in this class last semester because he was at the limits of excused absences already. His absence today makes him even with the number of excused absences for the entire year. If he misses three more days, or fifteen individual classes like he’s been doing, he’ll get expelled.” “For missing classes?” I asked with surprise and Cole nodded. “It’s in the student guide, Breckenridge.” Cole answered. “He got suspended two weeks before finals and I think he was happy about it. If he doesn’t turn his head around and start paying attention, he’ll be out the door and in alternative education by the end of the month. His mom’s probably getting a phone call personally from the principal right now.” “Oh.” I said, dumbstruck by the news. “It’s time for you to get back on the court.” Cole said, ending the conversation. I made a couple of stupid mistakes in the game, mostly because my mind was spinning with the news of Davey’s problems at school. Until now, I’d been thinking I had plenty of time, weeks or months to get to know him and encourage him to make some good changes, but now… now I knew I didn’t have that much time at all and I was still grounded. “Let’s go.” Brandon said fifteen minutes later as everyone else was milling about the locker room, getting ready to take showers. He and Trevor had just kept on their P.E. sweats as they met me at my locker. I just nodded and followed them out after putting my clothes into a gym back and looping it over my shoulder. There was a mess of people leaving, so we made our way to the baseball field’s dugout where they sat on the bench and stared at me while I leaned back against the metal bars on the field side. “So what’s this shit about you thinking we’re fags?” Trevor said with a frown after we’d all remained silent for a while. “I never said it like that.” I said defensively. “You’ve never used anything but fag or fudgepacker to talk about people like that.” Brandon pointed out. “Since when have you used anything else?” I shot back as a flash of anger welled up. A deep breath calmed it down. Damn it to hell, I was an adult, not a kid! “Look, let’s calm down here. We’ve been friends for half our lives already, right?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with his eyes squinting at me and his arms crossed. “Of course as soon as you and Marcie started going out it was like we ceased to exist unless you needed us for something with her.” “Then let me say I’m sorry about that.” I said with a frown. “I was stupid to let anyone, especially a bitch like that put our friendship in danger.” “You mean it, don’t you?” Brandon asked with his head cocked to the side and a look of surprise on his face. I nodded. “Fine, I accept your apology.” “As long as you don’t do the same thing with another bitch.” Trevor added with a hint of sulkiness. “You don’t have to worry about that, Trev.” I said with a smile and he smirked at me. “You really turning queer on us?” Trevor asked with a smirk. “If I was, I’d trust the two of you to be cool with it.” I said with a smile but they frowned at that. “I don’t know why you think…” Trevor started to protest while Brandon looked at the ground but I interrupted him. “You two started doing it with each other the summer before seventh grade, right?” I asked and they both looked up at me with shocked expressions. “Jesus, Trevor, your parents aren’t stupid people. Do you really think they missed you going out to the barn?” “They know?!” Trevor’s voice actually cracked at that. “They told you?” “No, but they’ve guessed.” I said with a shrug. “You know, they have to be cool about it if they haven’t said anything.” “Dude, your parents know.” Brandon’s voice was a hoarse whisper as Trevor shook his head. “I’m never going to be able to look them in the eyes again.” Trevor mumbled before looking up at me. “Dude, if you’ve known, why didn’t you ever say anything? I mean, I’m not really queer, you know, but I do like getting it where I can. I guess you could say I’m tri-sexual you know…I’ll try anything at least once…” “Yeah, okay.” I said with a nod and a smile. “Whatever works for you bro. It’s your business, not mine, okay?” “Yeah.” Trevor grunted. “Dude, you’ve always hated queers or anything smacking of stuff like that. What’s changed you?” “I can’t really say.” I said, not really wanting to lie to them, but neither did I want to tell them everything yet. They were different people than those I’d known for so long before. It would be smart to get to know them a little better. “I remember the first time I heard you say the word ‘fag’.” Brandon said softly, his eyes meeting mine after a long moment. “It was about this time of year during seventh grade. You came back from Christmas Break and you were like really pissed off. When I put a hand on your shoulder you told me ‘stop that fag shit’ and to leave you alone.” “I remember that.” Trevor said. “We thought you weren’t going to be friends with us anymore, but you started hanging out with us again later that month.” “My Uncle Rich died that Christmas.” I said with a heavy sigh. That was one story Davey had told clearly, how during his first time travel, what he called the second timeline, Uncle Rich had died as well only he’d been there that time. “I’ve never heard of him.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “I think I remember you talking about going to see him during the sixth grade.” Trevor said with a glazed look in his eyes as if he was trying to remember. “You never mentioned him again, though.” “My mom and dad always thought it was best if I didn’t mention my gay uncle at school.” Brian said, remembering that from his own childhood and guessing it applied here. “They weren’t ashamed of him, but they didn’t want me to get into fights when other kids said something bad about him if they knew I had a gay uncle.” “That makes sense.” Brandon snorted. “Yeah, well he died from AIDS that Christmas and I got a little angry.” I said, guessing from knowing how I would have reacted if my Uncle Rich had died. “Oh, shit, I’m sorry dude.” Brandon said as he stood and moved to put a hand on my shoulder. There were tears in my eyes as I realized that in this reality, I wouldn’t have Uncle Rich around like he’d been until I was in my sixties. Brandon ‘s hand stopped halfway to my shoulder, and he looked like he was afraid for a moment, but I solved that for him by reaching out and bringing him into a hug. A moment later Trevor joined us. “So this is what’s been bugging you ever since then?” Trevor asked softly. “Yeah.” I answered. “Sucks, don’t it?” “Yeah.” Brandon replied. “I know thinking about getting that fucking thing scares me shitless sometimes.” “That’s why you cover your stump before you hump.” I joked as the hug broke up and we all grinned at each other. “So did Marcie turn you off girls so much you’re going to do guys now?” Brandon asked. “I think you should keep it quiet if you, you know. I’m not about to have everyone think my best friend’s a fag.” “Is that why you went after that Jones guy this morning?” Trevor asked with a thoughtful look on his face. “I mean, I’m not sure how you’d know that he and I did the deed last semester, but he does have a pretty hot mouth.” “Dude!” Brandon laughed. “I had him give me a blow job freshman year. You remember when he was on crutches after Ruiz tackled him in practice? The day after Brian and Jay Collins threw that kid who had freckles all over his body into the trash can, my mom gave him a ride home and I stayed there for most of the night. He blew me while I laid back on his waterbed. It was pretty good.” Their words, each and every one of them struck home as I listened and tears came to my eyes again. My Davey… we’d been virgins that first time, or at least he’d physically been a virgin. I knew in his first life we’d never ended up with each other, but I’d never thought he’d have done it with… our friends. Had he secretly looked at them while we were dating and remembered what he’d done with them? “Brian?” Trevor’s voice got my attention. “You okay bud? That didn’t gross you out did it? Or are you upset because you thought you’d be the first to bag Jones?” “Um, I’m fine.” I said after clearing my head with several deep breaths. No, it was as much my fault as anything Davey might have done. If I’d gone back further, to 1981, maybe, I could have stopped all this from happening. Instead, I had to deal with the world as it was now, and go from there. Davey had done all these, and probably more, in the original timeline and still ended up with me in the second, and had stayed faithful to me, except the time I rejected him. No, I couldn’t let what I’d just heard poison my love for him. He had told me once that a lot of the things he went through as a late teenager, after his father’s arrest had made him the man he was when he went back in time. I couldn’t begrudge those experiences altogether, could I, if they had produced the man who’d made me so happy for so many years? “So, what now?” Brandon asked in worried tone as he looked at me. “I mean, Brian, you’ve been a good friend, but what does this mean?” “Who knows?” I asked in a voice almost as soft. “As far as I’m concerned, the rest of the world doesn’t need to know our business, right? We’re friends, good friends, and what we share with each other doesn’t go no further, right?” “Right.” Brandon and Trevor said in unison. “Now I have to go.” I said with a smile. “I’m already supposed to be home and I’m still grounded.” “See ya tomorrow, Bri.” Trevor said, patting me on the back as I took off from the dugout and headed back out to the car. It was as I was driving off that the location of our talk triggered a memory of another talk, and the things that had been said. Almost, I turned around to tell my friends the rest of the story, remembering Sean, but I didn’t. There was too much else going on right now. Chapter 3 “Your mother says that you were twenty minutes late getting home today.” Dad said as we sat at the dinner table, eating honey-glazed chicken with rice and steamed vegetables. My mother’s cooking was something I’d really missed without realizing it as the years had gone by in the last timeline. There were plenty of times when I’d had a bad day and come home to make something like this, something that reminded me of being a kid, protected by my parents’ love. Davey always called it comfort food. “Yes, I was.” I admitted cautiously, unsure of where he was going from the neutral expression on his face. “You did well this weekend, Brian.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “I want to hear what you thought was a good enough reason to risk ruining that progress by being late today.” “I… it’s been an eventful day.” I answered honestly. They just frowned at me for a moment and I let out another sigh as I sat back, trying to meet both of their eyes while twiddling my fork around my plate. “Marcie and I broke up.” “You don’t seem too heartbroken.” Dad said while both of them struggled to not smile over the news. “I thought… I thought after the reason you were grounded that you were going to go on and marry her once you’re out of high school.” “No way in hell.” I growled, surprised at the vehemence that came with the thought. “Watch your language, son.” Mom said, but there was no anger or sharpness in her voice, and her lips were quivering upwards. “I can’t believe I ever dated someone like… her.” I said even more vehemently. They were both smiling openly now. “Why didn’t you stop me?” “We tried.” Dad said with a sigh, and although his lips quirked downward for a moment he didn’t sound too angry. “Was she pushing you to sell the apartment?” “Yes.” I admitted, shaking my head. “I’m just glad I woke up in time. That apartment… it’s all I really have left of Uncle Rich in this world, isn’t it?” “Brian!” Mom’s voice sounded shocked, but there was a very soft smile on her face and tears in her eyes. “That’s the first time in years that you’ve mentioned him without cursing or looking like you wanted to hit something!” “I’m sorry mom.” I said softly, apologizing for the behavior of the ‘me’ from this timeline. “I… well sorry doesn’t cut it… but I miss him too.” “I do too, honey.” Mom said sadly. “We knew you were hurting from losing him, but every time we reached out to you, you turned us away.” “But that’s in the past now, I think.” Dad said with a tone of approval and he looked me over. “I think you’ve done some growing, and while I don’t approve of what brought this all to a head, I do approve of the results so far. We can forgive you being late since you were dealing with breaking up from a bad relationship.” “Actually, that was dead before lunch was over.” I said with a snort, remembering how… angry the cow had been. “Then why were you late?” Dad asked patiently. “I… I was talking with Brandon and Trevor about things.” I answered honestly, hoping he wouldn’t ask too many details. “I haven’t been the best son to you over the last few years, and I haven’t been the best of friends to them either.” “Now that’s an even better reason to be twenty minutes late.” Dad said with a smile that surprised me. “So, what else is going on with you?” “Master Chief Cole’s expecting me to join his Sea Scouts this semester.” I began and they looked confused for a moment. “You mean Coach Cole from your football team?” Dad asked. “Yeah.” I confirmed. “They’re having problems getting enough students, and well he asked me to join and I’m thinking about it. I’d need permission obviously, and well, it would mean coming home later a couple times a week, and probably leaving a little early as well.” “Are you doing this to get out of being grounded?” Dad asked and I shook my head. “Grounding won’t last little more than a week while the Sea Scouts thing goes on all semester and maybe even next year.” I answered him and he shrugged. “Good, because if you’re going to do it, you’re doing it all semester.” Dad said while mom nodded her agreement. “Anything else?” “Yeah.” I said as I shifted in my seat and played with the remaining food on my plate a little bit more. Suddenly I wasn’t very hungry and I was wondering if I should even discuss this with them, but they were my parents and I knew they could always help. “What is it, Brian?” Mom asked with a slightly worried frown. “I saw someone I haven’t seen in a while.” I answered. “He went to La Loma with Brandon, Trevor and me and he played on the freshman football team with us before his family moved to Nevada. He’s back at Downey now, and well, I don’t know how to describe it, but he looked kind of down, you know?” “What’s his name?” Mom asked with a tilt of her blond head. “Davey Jones.” I answered and she creased her eyebrows. “That sounds so familiar.” Mom muttered while Dad frowned. “Was his father a preacher?” Dad asked and I knew he recognized the name. “Yes.” I answered and Dad sighed. “Honey, you remember the story from last year.” Dad said to Mom. “David Jones Sr. was a local pastor who moved out to Nevada until his wife found out he was molesting their daughter. He came back to California and pled guilty to the molesting and was placed on house arrest.” “That’s right and there was something in the paper yesterday about him being arrested for violating the terms of his parole.” Mom said as she slapped her hand on the table in triumph. “He went too close to a school or something like that. Funny, they never mentioned he had a son.” “Yeah, well, Davey, I don’t know.” I said softly. “He’s not the same as I remembered him, like he was all hunched in on himself. Plus, he’s working at a McDonald’s near school, and missing classes because of it. Coach Cole said if he doesn’t start going to all of his classes soon they’ll kick him to alternative education.” “What does this have to do with you?” Dad asked. “I… I feel like I’ve spent the last few years being selfish, you know?” I answered, trying to sound as young as possible instead of older, wiser. “I saw Davey today when all the stuff with Marcie was going down and well, I began to wonder. We kind of knew each other years ago, and he’s a pretty cool guy, but since he came back he’s all withdrawn. Before… without Marcie, I might have tried to be a friend and maybe he wouldn’t look so… defeated.” “What do you want from us?” Dad asked. “An extra two hours after school before I have to be home?” I asked and Dad’s face started to cloud over. It was time to speak quickly. “If you’re willing to give me an extra two hours, I think it would be fair to also extend my being grounded a week.” “Even if that means you can’t have a birthday party?” Mom asked. “Yeah.” I agreed. “What about the Sea Scouts thing?” Dad asked. “The afternoon stuff counts as part of the extra two hours?” I offered. “The morning stuff counts as school time?” “Deal.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Thanks for letting me bargain.” I said with a smile and he laughed. The rest of the evening passed pretty quickly with me spending most of it on homework. Assignments from the first day weren’t too bad, but there was a lot of little things I had to review from the last semester so I would be current on what was being taught. Towards the end of the evening, I watched the Cosby Show with my parents, experiencing déjà vu from watching the old program that was now being run for the first time in this timeline. All the while my mind was plotting out different ways to reach out to Davey in this timeline, the way he’d reached out to me. It would have been so much easier to just bump into him like we’d done on the bike path in my own timeline, but that was years ago even here. No, something else was required, and I had to remember something else Davey had said about how he’d been in this timeline. Very, very closeted. His sleeping with Brandon and Trevor, as well as several other guys most likely (and even one or two girls from what he’d told me one time) was all one-time affairs. Most of the people he slept with during high school he never talked to again, from what he told me. That was probably one of the reasons he wasn’t friends with Brandon or Trevor, because after having had sex with them, he actively kept them at arms-length. He’d never exactly explained why, but I guessed it had to do with him not wanting to admit he was gay. So long as he wasn’t faced with daily reminders of his ‘weakness’ in having slept with them, he was able to pretend like it never happened until the next time. That would fit something I’d heard from many gay men who’d grown up in the eighties. It was also something I’d have to help Davey overcome eventually. No, for now I’d have to work at just being his friend and nothing more. That night I dreamed about Davey, as might be expected. Only, the Davey I dreamed about was the man I’d grown old with. After his stroke, he’d lost control of his bodily functions and so it had been necessary to put an adult diaper on him when he came home. I think, more than anything else that had embarrassed him deeply. I’d seen it in his eyes, and the way he tried to protest every time I carefully removed a fouled diaper, cleaned him up, and then put a new one on him. Sometimes he’d close his eyes and stretch his head back as if pretending it wasn’t happening, and other times he’d look at me with eyes that provided a glimpse into his tortured soul. I knew Davey Jones and the proud man he’d been, and I knew how much his need for help with even the most basic of needs shamed him. That was why I would never let anyone else change him, and made sure the physical therapists got him to the point that he could sit on a toilet again. He still needed help transferring from the wheelchair to the toilet, and I still wiped his butt for him, but he no longer had to wear the diaper. Those were small victories, but each of them had helped rid his eyes of that shame, and restored to me the proud man I loved with all my heart. In my dream, though, the look in Davey’s eyes was the same, but his body was that of the teenager I’d seen the day before. The dream was still fresh and vivid in my mind as I showered the next morning and dressed in a nice blue and white striped shirt with a pair of nice stonewashed jeans. Yes, Davey had always had a great amount of pride, and I could well imagine how much of a beating it was taking right now. Way back in 2006 of the last timeline, a scandal had erupted just forty days before the mid-term elections. On of Davey’s Aunts, from his mother’s side, had been arrested in Las Vegas for a pyramid scheme and embezzling money from a property management company she worked for as a manager. It was only another scandal, this time on the Republican side, which had ended the relentless attacks on President Jones for the illegal acts of his sister-in-law. It was the closest to an outright scandal that they’d had to deal with, and I’d seen a look of hurt in Davey’s eyes. The night of the election, we’d both gotten drunk off our asses at our D.C. home and he’d told me how much he’d always hated that aunt. Apparently she’d caused countless problems for him in the original timeline, and was someone he actually despised. He’d also shared how awful his family had been in that timeline, which was now the timeline in which I was living. The mirror on the back of my door helped me to make sure that I was looking good today. I couldn’t help whistling as I grabbed my car keys and left my bedroom. Mom was in the kitchen, and Dad was at the table with a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I grabbed a glass of orange juice and the cereal mom had out on the counter and sat at the table to eat. “Good morning.” Dad said as I sat down. He put down his paper long enough to find another section and push it in my direction. “There’s something in there you might want to read.” “Why do I have the feeling it’s not going to be good?” I asked rhetorically. It was the Metro section of the Modesto Bee, and below the fold it had a picture of David Jones, Sr. as well as a headline of “Former Pastor Released”. Davey’s father had been released from jail after it had been found that he’d not violated the terms of his parole. He was living with his mother, who lived a block from a school. The parole officer on his case had authorized him to live there, and he’d been on his way home from the neighborhood store when a police officer had arrested him. “Ah, crap.” I murmured, feeling sorry for Davey and his family for having to constantly go through this crap. The only reason the paper paid any attention to this was because Davey’s father had been a preacher. Then again, if something like this had happened in the last timeline, there would have been an even greater furor. “You still thinking of trying to be friends with him again?” Dad asked as I finished reading the paper and set it back down. “Yeah.” I said with certainty that was far firmer than he had any clue of it being. “This only makes me feel worse, you know? He’s been going through all this crap and I don’t see him hanging around other people at school. It must be pretty lonely.” “I’d imagine a lot of people wouldn’t want to be associated with someone whose father was in the papers for this kind of stuff.” Dad said and I nodded my agreement while chewing on some cereal. “I have to be off to work, but good luck.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. “Honey, you know you can invite him over anytime you want, even if you are grounded.” Mom said as I finished my cereal and took it back to the sink. “Are you sure?” I asked, surprised at how nice they were being. Then again, these were my parents, bleeding heart liberals, and I should have known better than to be surprised. It seems I’d forgotten just how caring they were. “Definitely.” Mom said with a smile. “I feel like I’ve got my old Brian back.” If she only knew. “There you are!” Marcie was not the sight I wanted to see this early in the morning on the front steps of the school. She was standing there with Brandon and Trevor, as well as their girlfriends Katie and Lisa, both friends of Marcie. Today Marcie was dressed in another mini-skirt, with a tube top barely covered by a jean jacket and more of that Madonna-style lace crap. She must have wasted at least ten bucks of make-up on her face as well, and I had to squelch the desire to tell her she was looking like a cheap whore. Instead I just approached the group while keeping an eye out for Davey. “Good morning.” I said in as neutral a tone as possible. “I wanted to talk to you.” Marcie said. “I’ve thought it over, and I’m willing to give you another chance if you apologize to me in front of our friends. You better make it good though if you want me to forgive you and take you back.” “You’re kidding, right?” I said as a laugh escaped my lips. She gave me a death-ray style glare while putting her hands on her hips. Oh my, she was not amused at all. “What the hell’s gotten into you?” She nearly screeched as one of her hands ended up waggling a finger in my face. “You’re like a totally different person! Don’t you remember how important you are to me? You need to treat me better.” “Shut up.” I growled as I slapped her waggling finger out of my eyesight. She seemed shocked enough by that, and her mouth flopped open. “You listen to me for a moment, woman. I’m not some toy you can play with when you feel like it, and I sure as hell am not about to spend the next forty years working my ass off so you can sit on a couch watching soap operas and eating bon-bons like Peggy Bundy! If you thought I was your meal ticket to an easy fucking life, you sure as hell should have treated me better than you have been. As for taking you back, you can apologize all you want but I want nothing more to do with you!” “Fuck you!” She yelled. Her face had been getting redder and redder as I yelled, and I was relieved that was all she had to say before she stomped into the school. Katie and Lisa followed her, and I was left with my two friends, who were both staring at me like I’d gone crazy. “What?” I snapped at them and relaxed as Trevor started to snigger. “Dude, that picture you painted of her on the couch… that’s fucking classic!” Trevor said around his sniggers. “Just one thing, who is Peggy Bundy?” Brandon asked as he started to chuckle. “Oh, yeah, um just somebody I made up.” I said with a shrug. Damn that was right, Married with Children wasn’t on television yet. Oh well, it still worked to drive her off and make sure she had no illusions that it was still possible to get back with me. Several dozen people must have heard me yelling at her. “Dude, you know she’s going to be a bitch for the next few weeks, don’t ya?” Trevor asked and I nodded. “So will our girlfriends.” Brandon said. “We might have to join you in exploring the dark side.” “Your choice, dude.” I replied with an easy smile. “The only thing is, I think both of you have already been there a lot more than me.” “Let’s head inside.” Trevor said and we followed him into the school. The girls weren’t in sight and I sighed with relief as we headed to our lockers. Both of theirs were near each other while mine was in another hallway. To my surprise, Davey was there, just a few feet down from Trevor’s. “Hey Jones.” Trevor called out. “Hey.” Davey said cautiously, his eyes glancing to the three of us. “Hey, I heard your dad was in the paper the other day.” Brandon said in a teasing tone and rage surged through me as I saw Davey turn white before looking away in shame. He slammed his locker shut and started to turn at the same moment I swung out with my arm and elbowed Brandon so hard he flew against the lockers with a loud clatter. As I faced Brandon and used my forearm to pin him against the lockers, I noticed Davey turning back to look at what was going on. “Dude, that is so fucking uncool!” I nearly shouted as my face flushed with my anger. Brandon had a surprised look on his face, as did Trevor. From this position I couldn’t see Davey, but that wasn’t important. “What?” Brandon gasped out. “How could you be so fucking mean?” I asked, surprised at the way I was cussing. It wasn’t something I’d done much of in the last few decades. “Mean?” Brandon gasped as I relaxed a bit and removed my arm from his throat. He straightened up a bit, grimacing as he stretched his back. “Dude, those fucking locks probably left a mark on my back! What the fuck did you do that for?” “You fucking pissed me off.” I fumed. “How the fuck could you do that to someone?” “Do what?” Brandon asked. “What you said to Davey.” I reminded him and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I just mentioned the article about his father.” Brandon stated. “What’s the big deal?” “How the hell would you feel if your family’s business was plastered all over the paper?” I asked him and Brandon looked like he didn’t understand. Neither did Trevor for that matter. “Dude, what the fuck’s gotten into you?” Trevor asked, moving to stand next to Brandon. I took a quick look around in time to see Davey’s back as he disappeared around a corner, while there were several other students watching us in the quickly filling corridor. “Think about what it must be like from his perspective.” I urged my two friends in a hoarse whisper. “Imagine if it was your father in the paper like that and everyone around you knowing the shit that was going on in your family.” “My father would never have done something like that.” Trevor snorted. “Mine either.” Brandon said with disdain. “Besides, if he’s going to go all sensitive every time someone mentions his father he’s going to have a lot of bad times before he graduates.” “Especially with idiots like you around.” I said furiously, ignoring the look of hurt on Brandon’s face as I spun around and stalked down the hallways towards my locker. My mind was spinning with a lot of thoughts, but most of them centered around Brandon and Trevor. They had been our best friends growing up, always there with us, always supportive and strong. How much of that had been because of Davey’s influence on us? Sean’s as well, but I had to wonder just how much of what I viewed as our moral strength during high school had been because of the influence of the two time travelers? How much change could I make in my friends who were currently stereotypical high school jocks more interested in the next game and dipping their dick in a hole than in understanding people? By the time history class rolled around, I hadn’t come up with any definitive answers, but I did know that I would be staying away from Trevor and Brandon for a while. They’d been giving me odd looks all morning, and from the way their girlfriends were whispering to them in the hallways between classes, I was quite convinced they were being given some ultimatums. Up until I walked into the history classroom, I was ready to mark the day off as a complete failure. A question to a girl in my last class who also had this class had confirmed that there was no set seating assignment, so when I saw Davey sitting in a desk against the wall closest to the door, I took the seat behind him and immediately turned so my back was on the wall. He sat in his desk normally, and had hunched his shoulders as soon as I sat down. The teacher was standing at the blackboard, writing something on the board while more students filed into the classroom. A thick-set geek with brown hair gave me a dirty look when he saw me sitting where I was, but didn’t say anything as he found another seat. “You ever wonder if George Lucas sat in one of these desks?” I asked of no one in particular, although I was facing the girl who had been in my last class. Ronna, that was her name, and if I remembered correctly she was a friend of Davey’s in this timeline as well as the one I came from. She’d been there when I first met Davey, well besides that baseball game. “Huh?” She asked. “You know, George Lucas.” I said, grateful that someone at least had responded. Davey was still hunched forward, but out of the corner of my eye I saw him shift slightly in his seat. “The guy who made Star Wars and American Graffiti.” “I know who he is.” Ronna said with a hint of scorn in her voice. “Why would he have sat in one of these desks and why wonder about it?” “These desks are old enough to have been here when he was.” I said with a snort and she actually giggled. Davey’s shoulders started to move like he was on the verge of laughing. He was wearing the same jean jacket as the day before, but the jeans he was wearing today looked to be in better condition, although he still had on the half-melted tennis shoes. “They probably were.” Ronna agreed with me. She had long, dark hair and was pretty. She was a little hefty, but not too badly overweight. “I knew someone who went to school with him.” Davey’s voice was almost inaudible, but he turned slightly in his seat to look at Ronna and then me. His face was devoid of any expression, as if he was afraid of what would happen if he showed something. “She lived on a ranch a couple miles down from my house back in Nevada. Her husband taught me how to ride a horse. She said she thought Lucas was nothing but a weird freak in school and now she wished she’d asked him out.” “I bet she does.” I said with a laugh and almost regretted it when he winced for a moment before a slow smile formed on his face. That was the moment the bell chose to ring and it was time for class. As the instructor turned around and I began to read the assignment on the board, I wondered just how the Brian of this timeline had ended up in a college-prep History course. Sure, some of the classes were college-prep, but not all of them were as they were when I had gone through high school. Whatever the reason, I was just glad that I was in the class with Davey as I turned to face forward in my seat. “On the board is the outline of your semester-long project.” Mr. Wansor said in a bored tone. “Be sure to write it down accurately as it will account for half your grade this semester. You may work on this individually or in pairs, but I warn you that if you choose to work with someone there will be no changing partners or going solo unless one of you dies. You will note that there are several due dates for this assignment, the first in just three weeks when you will turn in an outline of your project. Missing a deadline reduces that portion of the grade by one step. Each deadline counts for five percent of your grade on the project with your final presentation being ten percent. Instead of a written final in this class, you will give your project presentation. Now that you’ve written the assignment down, let’s open our textbooks to page thirteen and start with a discussion on the second Constitutional Congress.” The class was a typical one with the teacher trying to drag answers out of the students and getting monosyllabic answers instead of the erudite philosophy he probably dreamed about getting. Deep down I felt sorry for him, and halfway through class I raised my hand and gave him a five-minute answer to one of his questions. Then Ronna spoke up to argue about something I said, and to my surprise Davey responded to her statement by defending my point about the inclusion of slavery being necessary for that time and place, no matter how disgusting it was as an institution. That got Reggie, who I remembered from the football team involved when he called Davey a ‘racist’. Before I could defend Davey on that topic, Davey snorted and shook his head before shooting Reggie a look of contempt. “If you can’t listen to a white guy talking about the institution of slavery with honesty instead of bleating only about the horror of it, then maybe you should take a deep look at yourself.” Davey’s voice dripped with sarcasm that was so familiar I started to get hard. This was a glimpse of the Davey Jones I knew, cocksure to a fault, and full of derision for people whose viewpoints he disdained. Sure, Davey had hidden it a lot, but there had been more than a few times over the years that he’d unleashed it at people. His ambassadorial confirmation hearing had been one such event, when he verbally lashed out a freshman Republican Senator who was trying to make a name for herself. Davey had figuratively picked her up, spanked her bottom and sat her back down gently while extracting a promise from her that she’d behave like a grown up instead of a schoolyard bully trying to look good for the cameras. “Oh yeah?” Reggie said angrily. “I ain’t the one sittin’ here defending slavery.” “I am not defending slavery, as you would know if you bothered to really listen to what I’m saying.” Davey said. “Slavery was, and is, a horrible crime on the conscience of humanity. That doesn’t change the fact that if the founding fathers of this country had tried to get rid of it back then, there wouldn’t have been a United States today, nor a United States that would fight a bloody civil war during which the abolition of slavery would occur!” “I think that is enough for the moment.” Mr. Wansor ended the debate in a stern voice, but there was a smile on his face. The bell rang at that moment and Reggie was one of the first ones out of the classroom, giving Davey a glare as he left. Davey let out a long breath before picking up his books. As he stood, his shoulders slumped again and the breath of life that had filled him during class seemed to drain away with his exhalation. “Hey, Davey, wait a moment.” I called out as I picked up my own books and rushed out after him. He stopped long enough to turn around and glare at me for a moment. “It’s David.” He said in a low voice. “What?” I asked, confused for a moment. “My name, it’s David, not Davey.” He explained. “Oh, I thought…” I stammered. “What are you trying to do?” He asked, oblivious to the stream of people filling the hallway and trying to get past us. “Huh?” I asked although I had an idea what he was getting at with that question. “First this morning, and then you sit next to me in class using Ronna to strike up a conversation with me.” Davey said, showing me that no matter what had happened to him in this timeline, he was still as observant as ever, and as clever in figuring out why people were doing things. That was always one of his best gifts, being able to figure out people’s motivations with just a few words and some observations. “What kind of game are you playing with me? You’ve been in classes with me since the Seventh grade and have never shown this much interest in talking to me, not even when we played football together freshman year.” “I…” I wanted to tell him everything in that moment, but there was a little voice holding me back and it wasn’t just because we were in the middle of a crowded hallway with people all around us. “I’ve been thinking.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” He asked with a very familiar edge to his tone. Davey was getting angry. “It means I’ve kind of known you since seventh grade, except for when you were in Nevada, and I realized I really had never gotten to know you.” I started to explain in a wavering voice. His blue eyes were ice cold as he stared at me. “Why now?” Davey asked me angrily. “If you’re going to try to tell me it had nothing to do with that article, you’re crazy. I know you and your friends. You all love teasing people because of shit like that and if you think you can trick me…” “No!” I said vehemently, although my voice was barely more than a whisper. He must have seen how much I meant that because his head jerked back and he blinked. When he opened his eyes again, they were less angry, although he still had a wary look about him. “Then what?” He asked and I let out a long, slow breath. “I… when I saw that article, something inside me wondered what it would be like to be in your situation, with my family life spread out for everyone in the damn world to read.” I said quickly and as quietly as I dared to in the noise hallway. A guarded look filled his face now. “And?” He asked in a dangerous tone. “I kind of remembered that you were always a smart guy, and you seemed to be pretty cool when you were on the football team with us.” I said with a shrug. “You want to work together on the history project?” “Why would I want to work with you?” He said with a hint of sneer in his voice. That hurt, but I wasn’t going to show him how much it hurt. This was awful, I was standing here talking to the man I’d just spent some sixty-odd years living with as a husband, a partner, and now we were like strangers. No, we were strangers in more ways than one. I wanted my Davey, and it was only the look of love I’d seen in his eyes every night as I lifted him from his wheelchair and put him in our bed before crawling in and holding him tight that kept me from giving up at that moment. “Why are you here?” I asked and his eyes narrowed suddenly. “What do you mean?” Davey said as he switched from attack to defense. “Why are you here at Downey High?” I asked him, having remembered something very important. It had been at his mother’s graveside, and he was crying as he buried her yet again, but unlike other times he’d buried her, he was crying tears of joy and recollecting every time that she’d done something wonderful for him in all the timelines. There had been many things, and only a few about this, the original timeline, but there had been one very big thing she’d done for him, something he’d never really thanked her for until just before she had died in this timeline. “I…I live in the district…” He said defensively. “You know, in the articles it talks about your mother living in Ceres.” I said calmly, noting how his eyes widened. “Your sister, shouldn’t she be a freshman? Why isn’t she going to school here?” “That’s none of your business.” He said angrily and started to push past me, but I grabbed his arm and pulled him in close so I could whisper in his ear. “I think you came back because your friends from before are here.” I whispered quickly before he could pull away from my grasp on his arm. “You’re here because the people you went to elementary school, junior high, and freshman year are here. I heard your voice when you spoke about Nevada. You miss it a lot. Where did you go to school last year? You moved back here in November of 1984, but you didn’t come back to Downey until this school year. I bet you went to Ceres High, which is where your sister is going now.” “Shut up.” Davey whispered, but his tone was defeated and he didn’t bother trying to pull his arm out of my grip. His head was hanging down though, and I was willing to bet there were tears in his eyes. That made me feel bad, but it couldn’t be helped just yet. “What are you going to do?” “Why’d you come back here, to this school, Davey?” I asked him again, still just a whisper in his ear. “You know why.” He said and his shoulders heaved as he fought against a sob. “Tell me, please.” I almost begged. “I thought I had friends here.” He said bitterly. “Except for Ronna and Jeanette, though, there aren’t any here. While I played around at being somebody in Nevada, y’all moved on with your lives and I’m left in the fucking dust. There, you happy?” “No.” I said softly as I released his arm. He turned to look at me, and there were tears in his eyes, along with an angry glare that was fueled by confusion. “Then what?” He demanded in a low, angry voice. “You going to make me do your project for you like Ronna and Jeannette make me pay for their alcohol so they’ll hang around?” “No, we’re going to do this project together.” I told him with as mild an expression as I could put on my face. Oh, how I wanted to take him in my arms and wipe away those tears. “Let me tell you what I’ve been thinking. Your old man dragged you out to some backwater town in Nevada where he’d be a big preacher. I remember you in freshman football. As soon as your ankle healed from that bad tackle you were going to be back on the team and you had plenty of drive to get on second string, if not first. You had some friends, some decent friends here. Then you got dragged to bumfuck Nevada and had to start over.” “Are you a fucking mindreader?” Davey whispered with a look of shock replacing the anger on his face. “This town you lived in, was it big?” I asked and he shook his head. “Less than five hundred people in the entire fucking town, maybe as many people in the entire county as go to this school.” Davey answered. Yeah, that fit what I remembered of him telling me. “So you went from being another fish in the pond to being the big fish in the little pond, right?” I asked and he nodded his head after staring at me for a long moment. “Now you’re back to being just another fish in the pond and you don’t even know all the fish anymore because they’ve changed just like you have, and to make matters worse your father’s in all the papers and not in a good way.” “You are freaky.” He said in a whisper and I smiled. “Yeah, but I’m thinking I’d like to get to know you.” I said with that smile still on my face and I could see something melt in him before his shoulders slumped again. “Why?” He asked. “Sounds like you’ve figured out my pathetic life.” “Because as I was thinking about this, I realized if I was in that situation I’d want someone to be friends with who just might understand what I was going through.” I said calmly and he gave me a guarded look. “I also realized that while I may not understand everything you’re going through, I do understand some of it and maybe I should try and make friends with you. Lord knows anyone who’s been through shit like you have has got to be someone worth knowing. I’d be wanting to slit my wrists about now.” “Who says I haven’t?” Davey asked sarcastically and my heart nearly stopped at that thought, but then he’d lived long enough in this timeline to make it to 2004 alive. “So, we going to work on the project together?” I asked him and he nodded after a very long moment where I held my breath. “Good, I’ll see you in P.E., right?” I asked him. “Yeah, but I go to work right after.” He said softly. “Okay, see ya, Davey.” I said with a smile and walked off, not daring to look backwards. Had I said too much, or not enough? Only time would tell. Chapter 4 “You have to admit it looks pretty queer even if people don’t know what you said to us last week.” Trevor said in a way that totally set me off. “What the fuck did you tell her?” I yelled at him. We were in the middle of the nearly deserted parking lot. Both Trevor and Brandon were facing me, their body posture defensive. P.E. had ended long ago, and I’d just finished the afternoon’s NJROTC meeting only to find my two ‘friends’ waiting for me by my car. Davey hadn’t even waited for the end of P.E. before heading back into the gym and changing into his regular clothes. His car wasn’t in the parking lot when I came out, which I’d pretty much suspected since I’d stayed longer in the shower trying to calm down. It had been such a wonderful day from the moment I’d woken up this morning. Turning seventeen wasn’t supposed to be that big of a deal. Seventeen was the year between when you could get your driver’s license, and the year that you legally became an adult. There was just something about it though, at least for me this time around. Not many people could say they’d turned seventeen twice in a lifetime. My parents had even relented on my ‘birthday party’. It was just going to be a few friends, and of course my parents, but Davey would be there. He’d even asked for the night off of work, something he was really reticent to do, but he’d done it and that made me happy beyond belief. Davey had met me at the library after school twice now to work on our history project, and was starting to unwind a little around me. He’d been surprised when I asked him to come to my birthday party, protesting that he had to work. Money was tight for him, and he was working at three different McDonald’s restaurants in order to make his car payments, his insurance payments, and still have money for things like food and gas. His mother wasn’t working now because her back pain was so bad, and there were still the payments for his sister to go see a psychologist. The state had stopped paying for them, and his Nanny didn’t have the money for them since she was helping Davey’s mom by giving them a place to live, buying groceries, and helping to pay for the surgery Davey’s mom was going to have in a few weeks. Still, he was taking the night off so he could go to my birthday party. “Nothing about that stuff.” Brandon broke into the argument with his own angry look. “She’s just hurt, Brian, and she’s lashing out. Marcie thought you loved her and you just turned around and dumped her like that.” “Last week she said she dumped me.” I groused. “Yeah, well she’s a girl.” Brandon said with a sigh. “We’re not getting it any easier, you know. Our girlfriends are upset because she’s upset and they’re digging for why you won’t just apologize to Marcie so it’s all over. Add on that you’re now hanging around Davey and some of his freaky friends and everyone’s wondering. Reggie’s pissed at him because he’s a racist…” “He’s not a fucking racist.” I growled. “Reggie’s blowing things out of proportion just like Marcie is doing. How about his faggot comment in P.E.? That wasn’t exactly unbigoted, you know.” “Everyone hates queers, you know that.” Trevor said with a snort, earning a glare from me, but he didn’t say anything about my glare while Brandon looked off into the distance for a moment. “Look, it was you who said you were interested in Davey that way, and pretty soon people are going to figure it out. We don’t have to say anything. They’ll just assume you two are faggy on each other and go from there. You’re not acting at all like yourself, Brian, and you know that damn well.” “Well maybe I just fucking woke up and realized I wanted to be better than I’d been.” I snarled while resisting the urge to lash out at them. What made me really sick is that all these little popularity games in high school didn’t really end after graduation. They just changed, and grew more vicious. Kind of like the difference between playing poker with pennies and playing high stakes poker with a million dollars on the table. I’d lived in Washington D.C. for far too many decades to deny that the popularity games of high school were not reflective on the real world. “What the fuck was wrong with how you were before?” Brandon snorted. “I don’t know what’s going on in your head, Brian, but you better wake the fuck up. You’re doing that stupid Sea Scout thing, making friends with Jones and his freaky friends, and you’re totally ruining your reputation! Are you even going out for baseball this year?” “Of course I am.” I snarled. “Look, I just know I can be better than I’ve been lately.” “Don’t you remember what we promised each other back in seventh grade?” Trevor asked in a softer voice. “Yes, I remember.” I told him. “We decided we were going to be the baddest dudes in school and we’ve been that.” “Yeah, and now you’re fucking it up!” Trevor snarled. “Maybe I’m realizing there’s more than one way to be the best in our school.” I said angrily as I pushed past him and unlocked my car. “Brian.” Trevor said and then stopped as I got in the car and slammed the door. The engine started right up and I roared out of the parking lot, not caring if they got stung by loose gravel thrown up by my spinning tires. I was angry, as angry as I could ever remember being at my friends. Then again, they weren’t really my friends. I’d always known Davey had a positive affect on us in the last timeline, but this was just ridiculous. Brandon at least had always been more considerate of other people’s feelings while Trevor could be downright oblivious at times. Still, he’d never been so… arrogant before. I was relieved though when I pulled up in front of my house and saw Davey’s car out front. It was a Pontiac J2000; something I never even knew existed before. Still, there was no mistaking Davey’s car since the front-end was smashed up a bit. It wasn’t bad damage, just very noticeable. He’d had the accident just after midnight one weekend, having gotten off work late. He’d worked sixteen hours that day, he’d told me a couple days ago. Technically, it was a violation of the state’s child labor laws, but he got away with it because he’d only worked eight hour shifts at two different restaurants in town. That worried me, how he was working so much. It was taking away from his studies, and I knew now for a fact that most of the time he missed classes in school he was working because someone had gotten sick or quit and they’d called him to come in and work early. Then again, he was calling them every morning before he left for school to see if they needed the extra help. I parked my car behind his, leaving the driveway for my father and went inside the house. Davey hadn’t been over here before in this time line, but I knew my mother had been getting anxious to meet him so it was no surprise he was sitting in the dining room, having a soda while talking with my mother. “Brian, you’re home!” She said with a smile. “I found this young man here sitting out in his car waiting for you to get home, so I told him he had to come inside.” “Hi Mom, hi Davey.” I said with a smile while mom frowned. “Davey?” Mom asked. “Only Brian calls me that.” Davey said with a sigh. “Everyone else calls me David.” “Oh, I see.” Mom said with a curious little half-smile on her face. “Well, I’ll just let you two boys go do your thing while I finish getting things ready for Brian’s birthday party. Brian, did you know David’s birthday was last week? You boys are less than a week apart in age.” “Really?” I asked feigning surprise and wondering just how she’d managed to get that information out of Davey. I’d tried to get him to admit his birthday but he’d flat out told me it was none of my business. He was blushing now. “Yes, so now you’re going to have to go shopping with me so we can get him a nice present, even if it is after the fact.” Mom said before sailing out of the room. “You don’t have to do that.” Davey said softly. “Dude, forget the protests.” I said with a chuckle. “You’ve given Mom an excuse to go shopping and there’s no way in hell she’s going to give up a shopping trip just because you don’t want to be embarrassed.” “Oh.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “So…um…” “I’m sorry about P.E.” I said quickly and he shook his head. “Let’s not talk about that.” He said as he stood up. “I was wondering if you wanted to work on the history project. We’ve got the deadline for the outline coming up and I don’t want to drag your grade down by missing it.” “That sounds good.” I said. “Let me show you my room.” While we sat and debated different things for the history project, I couldn’t help but relax and feel like things were going better. Here, in my room where it was just the two of us, I could actually feel us growing closer. At school, Davey walked around with hunched shoulders, meekly flowing around the crowded hallways so he wouldn’t bump into people or bother them. If people wanted to talk or interact with him, they had to dig deep to get a reaction and it took a lot more effort than most high school students were willing to give. Yesterday, a guy whose first name I knew was Todd had stopped me in the hallway to say he’d seen Davey actually talking to me and how he thought that was ‘cool’. “I tried when he first showed up last semester, but it seemed like he always had something else he’d rather be doing.” Todd had said. “We were pretty cool in junior high, but he like totally disappeared freshman year.” The Davey I’d known in the previous timeline had decades of memories and experiences behind him and had been one of the most articulate and well-reasoned people I’d ever known. This Davey, the one sitting in my chair while I sat cross-legged on the edge of my bed, didn’t have those years of experience and memories to draw from. Despite that, while we talked about our history project, I was finding that he was just as articulate and well-reasoned. Sure, he wasn’t quite as able to pull up quotes and historical references, but he was the rough diamond that had become the well-polished diamond I’d known. A part of me wondered if that was how he’d seen me in all the different timelines as he’d gotten to know me again and again. “Boys.” Mom said as she knocked on my closed door. “Yes?” I called out and she opened the door just enough to stick her head inside. “Your dad called, Brian.” She said to me. “He’ll be home in about twenty minutes. We’ve got reservations for five o’clock at Marlucci’s so you boys should get ready. Davey, do you need to call anyone before you go to dinner with us?” “I…um…I can just go home.” Davey said hesitantly. “There’s no need for you to…” “Nonsense.” Mom said with a snort. “You’re coming to Brian’s party after, right?” “Yes.” Davey said slowly. “Good.” She stated with an emphatic nod of her head. “You’re here now and it makes no sense at all for you to go home only to come back later for the party. We made the reservations before Brian and Marcie broke up so you can just take her place.” “Thanks, mom.” I said while trying not to break out in laughter. Would she remember that line when Davey and I were finally a couple and came out to her? “Just remember you need to be wearing slacks and a nice shirt.” Mom said. “Oh.” Davey said a little crestfallen. “Don’t worry, we’re about the same size.” I said as Mom closed the door behind her. Sure, this Davey wasn’t nearly as in-shape as I was, and he had a bit of gut over his belt, but there should be something in my closet to fit him, and we spent the next ten minutes getting him into a pair of slacks that were a bit tight but still fit, and a dress shirt as well as a nice sweater. He was a little hesitant changing in front of me, and I frowned at the sight of the ragged underwear he had on, but we were dressed and ready to go by the time Dad arrived. Yes, I did notice the sly looks he gave me as I stripped down to my briefs before getting dressed. That was a good thing on all accounts, and I took extra time changing just so he would get a bit of a show. Yeah, I was going slowly with that aspect of our budding relationship, but there was no reason why I couldn’t show him what he’d get one day. Dinner was great, which wasn’t surprising since it was one of the best Italian restaurants in Modesto. Davey looked really uncomfortable at the start as we all perused the menus. He even tried ordering something relatively inexpensive, but I stepped in and talked him into ordering something a little higher up on the menu, something I knew he’d enjoy more. Dad and Mom both looked on with approval. As we all munched on mozzarella patties, my Dad started in on trying to draw Davey into conversation. He was subtle about it, first asking me questions about how school was going, how the NJROTC was going, and my plans for sports in the upcoming months. I’d played baseball every year since I was seven, except for skipping it last year, and he knew what I was planning on doing, but I knew he was getting me to talk first before he started asking Davey questions. “Well, what about you, David?” He asked Davey after I’d talked about my hopes that maybe this year Downey’s baseball team would win more games than we lost. “How is your semester going so far?” “It’s okay.” Davey said with a shrug as he quickly stuffed some cheese into his mouth and chewed while my father looked at him with a smile on his face. “Are you going to go out for any sports?” Dad asked him when he was done chewing. “Um, I can’t.” Davey said cautiously before taking a swallow of ice tea. “Oh, why not?” Dad asked him with a lift of his eyebrow. Like me, both my parents were blond but it was obvious I got my dark eyebrows from my father. “I have to work.” Davey said after a long pause and a glance at me. “Oh, that’s just too bad.” Mom said with a frown. “Young people should be able to enjoy their last few years of high school before they have to work.” “Yeah, well, my family needs the money.” Davey said with a shrug. “That’s right, Brian mentioned your mom was having major surgery in a few weeks.” Dad said and I hoped Davey wouldn’t get upset. He gave me a glance I couldn’t quite fathom, but he nodded at Dad’s statement. “Yes, they’re going to try to fix her back.” Davey said. “Nanny, that’s her mother, is paying for it so money’s really tight now.” “What’s wrong that they need to operate?” Mom asked. “Brian didn’t really give us too many details.” “Well, you see she’s had scoliosis since she was thirteen.” Davey said calmly. Apparently talking about his mother’s condition didn’t quite make him as uncomfortable as talking about his working. “They didn’t catch it until it was too late and after a really tough operation she ended up having a hump on her back. It means she gets tired easily and is always in a lot of pain. She also can’t breath that easily, so she gets winded pretty quickly. The surgery is supposed to help with that.” “What are they going to be doing?” Mom asked and Davey warmed up to the topic. “They’re going to break her ribs loose, reposition them and then reattach them to her sternum.” He answered, oblivious to the way Mom’s face went slightly white. “They’re also going to do something with her spine, help straighten it out some. She’ll still have that hump on her back, but it’ll be half the size it is now and she’ll have better lung capacity. The doctors say it should help her be able to work again. Right now she can’t stay on her feet more than a few hours without downing so many painkillers she goes loopy.” “Oh my, it sounds painful.” Mom said softly. “That’s what they say.” Davey agreed with her. “Mom’ll be in Children’s Hospital for at least a month while she recovers and then another four months recovering at home before she can expect to work again.” “Well, thank goodness for disability.” Dad said and Davey frowned. Dad saw it and reacted. “Don’t tell me they’re trying to not pay her disability.” “They’re saying it’s an elective surgery, not mandatory.” Davey answered. “Besides, we haven’t been back to California long enough for her to qualify since she’s only had one job and that was only for three months before the pain was too much for her.” “That’s just not right.” Mom said with a hint of anger in her voice. Davey looked surprised to hear that. “Don’t they understand she has a family to support?” “Yeah, well, we moved back in with my grandparents.” Davey said with a shrug. “It’s a little crowded with Shantill living there with her daughter, but Mom and Jenny share a room while Shantill sleeps in the middle bedroom. Nanny and Papa dote on her daughter, Whitney, and put her in the bed with them every night.” “Where do you sleep?” Mom asked, beating me to the question. “Papa converted the garage into a living room when they bought the house back in the sixties.” Davey answered. “So now you get it as your bedroom?” Dad asked with a smile. “Kind of.” Davey answered and I frowned. “My bed is behind the couch, and I’ve got a dresser I can use for my clothes, oh and I’ve managed to fit my stereo in next to the bed. As long as I wear headphones I can listen to it all I want, and Nanny and Papa usually go to bed after the 11 o’clock news so it’s not too bad. Plus, they make pretty good alarm clocks. They both get up around six in the morning and when they turn on the kitchen lights it’s even better than having an alarm clock. Papa put in these fluorescent lights over the dining table and when they turn them on in the morning they’re bright enough to wake me right up.” “I see.” Dad said slowly, and I could see the tightness around his eyes. This was… Davey had never mentioned this to me in our last lifetime. Maybe it was something he’d long forgotten, judging from the suddenly bitter expression on his face. The food arrived, saving him from further grilling by my parents for at least a few minutes.",

What do you say when the world is ending and your only option is what you promised to never do again? Chapter 1 “I’m way too old for this.” Sean muttered as they stood over the control console and the machine sputtered to life. He’d always been on the short side, and now in his eighties he begrudged every millimeter of height he lost with advancing age. My own hands were as wrinkled as his while I pushed the appropriate buttons on the computer console. The familiar sound of a magnetic resonance imager spinning to life filled the small room. “I can’t believe this specific machine has been used as a regular MRI for twenty years without anyone knowing it was really a time machine.” I muttered and Sean chortled softly before pushing another button and inserting the small flash drive into the correct slot. Five seconds later, the program was being loaded. “It’s always best to hide things in plain sight.” Sean muttered a very familiar mantra and I nodded my agreement. “The time bubble is now active. We’re safe as long as we remain in here.” “No one can come in?” I asked, although I already knew the answer. It was a sign of how nervous I really was. “You know that.” Sean smiled. “We’ve got plenty of power for what we need to do, but not much more than that. The bubble will keep people out, and it’ll keep the radiation out as well.” “That’s good or we might not live long enough to do this.” I said unnecessarily. We both knew the dirty bomb that had gone off thirty minutes ago was killing millions outside the bubble. That was why we’d been sent down here, on direct orders of the President. President David Jones Sr. had passed away many years ago, and while the man who currently held that office was of a different political party, the legacy of knowledge about time travel had been passed to the current President. Every President since Jones had known about the ability to go back in time, but none had given in to the temptation until now. “The program is uploaded.” Sean said with a hint of excitement. Both of our hands were shaking as our eyes met and I nodded. He typed in the execute command, and the machine on the other side of the room began to whir faster. There was no one inside it, but the components that sent a person’s memories back in time were active, sending out the program that Sean and Brandon had developed a decade ago. “It’s working.” Sean said as he nodded with his head towards the television in the corner. It had been showing static, but now it showed a newscaster talking about some report regarding the War on Terror. “That’s still going on?” “It should be over by now.” I muttered, shaking my head as Sean turned up the volume and we listened to the report about the forty-year old war. “The fucker died in bed?” Sean growled angrily. “How much time do we have before the bubble runs out of power?” I asked. “If we don’t use the machine to go back, we could survive in here longer than we have food or water.” Sean answered. “If we use the machine, it depends on how far back we go. The program worked, by the way.” “I figured that.” I answered with a gruff voice and a shake of my head. They were gone, my husband and partner, our sons, our grandkids were all erased along with every instance of time travel in the history of humanity. Our orders were not to go back, but to run the program, erase time travel and all the possible timelines it had created, and then shut down the machine so that we were erased as well. We would pass out of existence, and with us the knowledge of time travel would be gone forever, or at least until someone else invented it in the far future. “Any luck connecting to the Internet?” I asked and Sean started cussing. “All the wireless signals are encrypted and I can’t get around them.” He muttered. “They must use some type of system our timeline never invented.” “That’s a pain in the ass.” I agreed with his sentiments. We’d hoped to use the Internet to make sure this timeline was free from nuclear bombs, gas attacks, and all that crap. “I take it we’ve just got broadcast television, not cable or satellite?” “Just broadcast.” Sean muttered. “Let’s see what we can find.” I said, moving to change the channel. Eight hours later we were both thirsty and had to relieve ourselves in a corner of the room. It now smelled like urine, but we barely noticed based on the things we’d learned. “Amazing how much you can learn just from watching television.” Sean groused as he switched off the offending machine. “Israel nuked six years ago, and the United States held hostage by six ships in harbors of American cities, threatening to detonate nuclear bombs if we interfere.” “They were all wrong.” I muttered with a shake of my head. “The world wasn’t necessarily a better place without the interference of time travel.” “Plan B, then?” Sean asked and I nodded. “Do we have a choice?” I asked. “How much power do we have left?” “Enough to send one person to 1986 and that’s it.” Sean said after he looked at the display panel. “You know it’s not going to be easy. There won’t be any other time travelers now, just whichever of us goes back this time. Plus, we don’t know every little detail of this future or how to fix it.” “We know how to be in place when the time comes.” I answered with a heavy sigh. To be honest, I was looking forward to dying in my old age. My life had been a good one, and if not for this one last incident, I could have died a happy man without time travel messing up my life again. “You want to go, Sean?” “Don’t be an idiot.” Sean growled with a grimace. “I am plenty happy to die when the bubble collapses and leave you to carry the responsibility alone.” “Fine, let’s do it.” I muttered and Sean nodded once with a hint of understanding in his eyes. It took another hour for the preparation to be made and I was laying on the table waiting to be inserted into the machine. Sean was sticking a needle in my arm, injecting the drugs that would slow my brain function and highlight the necessary memories stored in my brain. Then the machine would scan them, record them, and send them back in time to my younger body. This would be different, because the program we’d run hours earlier had ‘jammed’ the signals of other time machines, effectively stopping the transmissions of earlier time travelers. The 1986 I was about to enter was pristine, unchanged by the meddling of other time travelers. Ronald Reagan was President, I lived in Modesto California and David Jones Sr. wasn’t a member of the President’s cabinet. He’d never be President either. So much would be gone, so much of the world I had loved for the past sixty years would be gone forever, and I’d have to build a new life with my love, who wouldn’t even be a friend in this original timeline. Would he remember me at all? Could I convince him he was better off with me than with where his life would lead otherwise? We’d have decades, well years, to try and make it work before anything would need to be done. The history of previous time travel taught that making big changes would only backfire, that small changes yielded the best results. Even with the dirty bomb that had gone off in Washington D.C., this last timeline had been the best of them all. For thirty years there had been a peace relatively unknown in the history of the world, and the history books of that timeline had credited President David Jones Sr. with forging that peace. It had only been bungling by several of the Presidents who took office after him that had created a situation where so many people had died in needless conflict. The old saying was that Pride Goeth Before the Fall, and the pride of the men and women in that office had been high, too high. As always, it had been the common people who had paid the price for the pride of their leaders, and at the last, even the leaders had seen their errors. “You ready?” Sean asked as the drug began to take effect. Really, kind of late for that question wasn’t it, but he knew what Sean was doing. He could die now, never having to go back in time, and Sean would remove his body from the table and go back himself. The burden could be placed squarely on Sean’s shoulders this time, instead of his, but he remembered how painful Sean’s teenage years had been in the original timeline, the timeline he was preparing to go back to, and he shook his head. Sean smiled with tears in his eyes as things began to go grey for me. “Thank you.” Those were the last words I heard as everything went black. How long things were black, I couldn’t tell, but eventually I was able to open my eyes. It was still dark, and I was on my back, in bed. It took a few minutes for me to stumble out of bed. My entire body felt different, moved different, and as I reached the light switch and my eyes squinted in the sudden brightness, I let out a sigh of relief. My vision was clear, no need for those damn glasses. The back of my hands were smooth, with no age spots or wrinkles, and when I ran them over my body, I could feel how tight and smooth it was as compared to my sixty-odd year old body I had just left. My room wasn’t that different than what I had expected and I let out a sigh of relief. Sure, there were difference, like the picture on my desk, but they weren’t shockingly strange. A glance at the clock showed that it was nearly time for me to be up anyway, so I opened my door and proceeded to the shower. It was good, being in my young body again, I decided as I finished the shower and let out a sigh of relief at the dirty deed I’d just finished along with my cleaning. The images of my husband in his youth had been fresh and clear in my mind as were the images and memories of our lives together. Fifty plus years had passed by in the last timeline, and we’d spent them with each other and our children and their children. That should be more than enough for most couples, and it had been, but now I was wondering what another fifty years would be like, and I had a wistful smile on my face as I wrapped the wet towel around my waist and exited the bathroom, only to run into my father. “Brian, what are you doing up?” He asked with surprise and I had to resist the urge to hug him right away. I was fairly sure that, even as good of a son as I was, my father wasn’t use to hugs from his sixteen-year-old son. He’d died ten years ago in the last timeline and I had missed him almost as much as I’d missed mom, who died five years later. “I thought I’d go for a run.” I answered and he gave me a look like I was half-crazy. “You’re still grounded, remember?” He had a warning tone in his voice and I winced. Grounded? What had I done to be grounded? “I don’t care if it was New Year’s Eve, coming home at six in the morning with alcohol on your breath and your girlfriend in the car with you is not behavior I expect from you.” “I… I’m sorry.” I said with shock. “You’re damn right you’re sorry, Brian.” My dad fumed as his anger started rising. Oh fuck, he was really mad. Then again, he had a right to be. I had been a father, and remembered Richie doing something like that when he’d been seventeen. We’d grounded the boy for two months. The thought of my son, who was dead and gone now, brought tears to my eyes. Dad looked at me with some surprise. “Are you progressing to fake tears now?” “No.” I said hoarsely. “No, I’m just… you’re right. I could have killed both of us driving after drinking, and you’re right, it wasn’t right to bring her here. I should have taken her home.” “Well, finally you’re showing some sense instead of talking back or giving me the cold shoulder.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Don’t think you’re un-grounded though. That stays; you’re grounded until your birthday. No car, no friends over, no girlfriends over, and no parties. When school starts, we’ll let you drive your car to school, but you have to come straight home.” “Can I at least go running in the mornings?” I asked. “I promise, I won’t use it to meet up with friends or anything, just go running, by myself.” “What if you just happen to run into a friend along the way?” Dad asked with a frown. “I’ll tell them hello and that my evil father grounded me and I can’t talk to them until school starts.” I said with a half-grin that I knew always softened him up. He actually laughed before giving me a strange look. “Son, I don’t know what happened overnight, but it’s like you finally grew the fuck up.” My dad said with a shake of his head. “I like this Brian a hell of a lot better than the one that told me I was an idiot before he went to bed.” “I’m sorry about that too.” I said, horrified that I would have ever said something like that to my father. He’d always been a good father, one I could tell anything to, or at least he had been in the last timeline. This man didn’t seem all that different than the one I’d known, so I had to wonder if it had been me that had been so different? “You can go for your run.” He said after looking into my eyes. “I don’t know what changed overnight, but I’m willing to trust you this much. Don’t screw it up.” “I won’t, dad.” I said, giving in to the urge to hug him. He looked surprised, but returned the hug after a moment. Then it was time to go back to my room, find a pair of sweats to put on, and to stretch. Old age had put an end to my daily runs with Davey, but we’d still gone for walks each and every day we were both home. Once he’d had his stroke and couldn’t walk anymore, I’d pushed him in his wheelchair around the park across the street from our home. In the last few months, he’d been able to speak a little bit and his constant announcements of how much he loved me had assured me that the stroke may have taken away a lot of things, but it hadn’t taken my Davey away from me. It was refreshingly cold outside as I began my run, and I almost considered going back for another sweatshirt. There was no need though as I began to sweat with the pace I started, trying to see just how my younger body reacted. Running was good not only for my body, but because it allowed me time to think about the situation I was now experiencing. I personally had no memories of this timeline. Everything I knew about it was from what I’d been told by Davey and by Sean. Fortunately, thanks to how time travel worked, I had perfect memories of those conversations. Rather unfortunately, neither of them had been entirely forthcoming about this timeline. Both of them viewed it as a ‘dark’ timeline for them personally and had been reluctant to share details. Still, there were some details that I did know and as I ran, I went over them carefully. All my life, I had known that I wasn’t nearly as smart as either Davey or Sean. They could take in any situation and find solutions to problems like it was no more difficult than breathing. In law school, I’d learned that I could also solve problems, but it took me longer. I had to do a lot of research, and have time to properly prepare what I learned. Then I had to take more time preparing my arguments, figuring out the counter-arguments, and then the counters to those counter-arguments. Davey could do it in the flash of an eye whereas I took hours and hours, but eventually I’d come up with the solution. Sometimes, when the solution required a lot of research and preparation, Davey would flounder while I eventually solved the riddle of the problem. That would be my greatest asset in this situation. I only had pieces of the puzzles that led to the problems off in the far-future in this timeline. For the closer future problems, such as how to win Davey over, I had less time and just as few pieces of the puzzle, but I did have time to think things through and find some solutions. Time was both my enemy and my ally now. President Jones was a key figure in figuring out how to win Davey in this timeline. Not in the sense he might have been if this was 1981, but in the sense of what was going on now. It was our junior year of high school, and Davey had given me several clues as to what was going on with him now. Just thinking about what he was going through made me stumble and lose my pace. Here, in this timeline, Davey and I had never really been friends. We were more like ‘friendly acquaintances’, to use his term, when we were in our freshman year of high school. He’d moved away that year, to a place called Eureka, Nevada. His sophomore year, he’d returned after his mother learned that his father in that timeline had sexually molested Jenny. The thought of President Jones being capable of doing such an evil thing caused me to shudder, and I resumed my earlier pace, enjoying the brisk winter chill, my foggy breath steaming out of me, and the heat being generated by my body as I continued to run. I knew that when they moved back to California, they’d lived with his Nanny, his maternal grandmother and he’d gone to Ceres High for the rest of his sophomore year. Then he’d gotten his mother to get him transferred to Downey for his junior year, the school I attended with our friends Trevor and Brandon. Sean, in this timeline, no longer attended the school because of his ultra-religious parents. Or did he? I could never quite remember that because Sean had never really been specific, nor had Davey. When Davey had gone back to Downey, he’d found we’d all moved on with our lives and didn’t really remember him. As a result, he’d pulled in on himself and sometime during the last half of his junior year, he’d quit going to school, gotten his GED and ended up graduating from Navy boot camp three months before the rest of us graduated from High School. There was much more I didn’t know. Where did he live? Would he still find me interesting? I knew he was already having sex, but then apparently so was I with my ‘girlfriend’, whoever that was in this timeline. Did the fact that we were both already sexually active make it impossible for him to love me the way he did before? No, those were personal insecurities that I’d always felt, and I refused to let them stop me from gaining the love of Davey Jones. Another question I’d have to deal with eventually is what do I tell Davey, and my other friends, about time travel? The secrets of how to build a time machine were dead and gone, and I didn’t know nearly enough to help build another one. Nor did I think we should. That thought made me stop for a bit, breathing heavily into the cold air as I pondered if I was being a hypocrite. I was thinking time travel should die forever, but I’d used it to correct a situation. No, I couldn’t lie to myself. I was far to old to shy away from the truth. Some part of me had known in that last world that Davey and I had never been a couple and I’d come back to change that. Back in the time bubble, I hadn’t even thought about it directly, but down deep I knew the great love of my life had never happened and I couldn’t stand to let things stay that way. The excuse about ‘fixing’ the events of this timeline forty-odd years from now was just that, an excuse, to do what I really wanted. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor’s voice surprised me and I turned to see my old friend jogging up the sidewalk towards me. He had a broad smile on his face and stopped when he reached me. “So, you tricked your old man into letting you out after all?” “No.” I answered a little more harshly than I intended. Some part of me had forgotten how handsome Trevor was at this age. His brown curly hair practically gleamed and while he was a good four inches shorter than me, his body was perfectly trim and in shape. “Sorry, but I promised him I wouldn’t use running as an excuse to get out of being grounded.” “Dude, what’s wrong with you?” Trevor snorted and gave me a look like I was crazy. “Nothing.” I said as I turned and started to head back to the house. “I’ll talk to you in school, Trevor.” “You’re insane!” Trevor shouted. “Did you forget I was supposed to take you to Missy’s?” “Tell her I’ll talk to her in school!” I shouted back. “She’s going to go apeshit!” Trevor shouted but I was far enough away that he didn’t bother trying to catch up. That had been another shock; that the me of this timeline had planned to sneak out just like this, but unlike me hadn’t intended on keeping his word to dad. What the fuck was wrong with this timeline? “You’re back.” Dad said as I walked through the front door. He was wearing an old pair of jeans and a t-shirt as if he was preparing to do some work around the house. I could hear Mom in the kitchen, probably fixing breakfast from the smells that were wafting around the house. “Yes.” I answered him and he nodded. “Your mother will have breakfast ready soon.” He said. “I’ll need your help in the garage after breakfast. The dryer’s squealing.” “It’s probably the motor belt.” I said and he just looked at me. “I’m going to take another shower, okay?” “That’s fine.” He said and I headed into my room. I noticed the pile of school books on the desk and wondered if I had homework left to do. In my own timeline I’d have been confident that I’d already done them, but there was a nagging bit of doubt in me that the “me” of this timeline would probably have just ignored them during the holiday break from school. As I showered for the second time this morning, I wondered what I would find when I went back to school. This should be the Saturday morning before school started, if the machine had worked the way it was supposed to in sending me back here. I could feel my heart racing as I thought about what I would find when I went to school. Would he be there? Would he be in any of my classes? For that matter, what classes would I have and in what time periods? “Good morning, honey.” My mom said as I entered the dining room where she’d already set three places for breakfast. It was nice seeing her so young again, and she smiled when I gave her a hug before sitting down. Dad just watched me in silence while we started eating. Part of me wanted some of the coffee they were both drinking, but I settled for the glass of orange juice to go with the waffles, sausage and eggs. I’d dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, similar to dad’s, so that I’d be ready to work with him as soon as breakfast was done. “Did you see anyone on your run?” Dad asked me after a few minutes of silence. “Yes, Trevor was running too.” I said calmly, watching him as he raised an eyebrow. “Is that why you came back so early?” He asked and I nodded. “I told him I was still grounded.” I informed him. “Good, because you are.” He said sternly and that killed all the remaining conversation until we’d finished eating. As I worked with him on the dryer, I knew things were not okay between him and I in this time, and I debated with myself on how to change that. In the end, I decided it would just take time. “Thanks for your help.” He said as we listened to the dryer run smoothly about an hour later. “No problem.” I replied. “Your homework done yet?” He asked me and I shook my head. “Well you have plenty of time today and tomorrow to work on it.” “Thanks.” I said, taking that as a dismissal and heading inside. After washing my hands, I went into my room and began to look through the books and notebooks scattered on my desk. Twenty-three minutes later I wasn’t a happy camper. The classes I was in at school weren’t what I expected. They weren’t exactly idiot-level courses, but they weren’t the advanced placement courses I’d taken in my own timeline. To make matters worse, the notebooks seemed to be filled with stupid notes between Trevor and I about the physical and mental attributes of girls in our classes. There weren’t even notes about our assignments. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. Giving up in disgust with myself, I got up and went to find one of my parents. “Hi mom.” I said as I found her in her sewing room. She at least smiled at me. “Hello Bri.” She said as she stopped the machine she was using to sew together a dress. “What is it?” “Is Dad here?” I asked. “No, he’s gone over the Marshall’s house for a bit.” She replied. “Oh, I was going to ask him if I could call Brandon.” I said with a sigh. “My notes aren’t clear about one of my assignments and I was going to see if he could help me out.” “Brandon’s not in any of your classes except P.E.” Mom said with a frown and a sharp look at me. “What are you trying to pull?” “I think he has one of my notebooks in his backpack.” I said while trying not to wince at that. “Your dad has your assignments listed from your teachers.” She informed me and this time I wanted to groan. “After your awful grades he got them from your instructors.” “Oh, then I don’t need to call someone.” I said softly. “Do you know where it is?” “Yes.” She said, giving me a sharp look. “You sure you still don’t need to make a call?” “Yeah, I just need the assignments.” I told her and she shook her head. “I almost believe you.” She said as she stood up and went into their bedroom. When she came out, she handed me two sheets of paper with all the assignments written on them. The bad news was that there was a lot listed there, but the good news was that the classes were so easy I’d be able to breeze right through them. “Thanks mom.” I said with a smile. “Don’t forget your father will want to look over them tomorrow.” She warned me and I just nodded. Several times during the youth of our last timeline, Davey had commented on how doing high school work again was both easy and difficult at the same time. For the first time I really understood what he’d meant when he said that. Math was easy, especially this basic algebra crap I was taking now. The English essay I had on a reading assignment was just as easy. The book was even an old favorite of mine in the last timeline, so I just had to skim through certain parts of it to make sure my recollections were correct. History was difficult. It wasn’t difficult because I didn’t remember what the importance of the Magna Carta was, but because most of the assignment was about the memorization of dates. Instead of asking why the provisions of habeus corpus were so groundbreaking, it asked how many of the King’s nobles participated in forcing him to sign the document and what year it was done. Bah! “You want some lunch, honey?” Mom asked several hours later as she poked her head in my door. Apparently I was not just doing assignments over the break, but make-up work to get my grades up a bit. They were barely enough to keep me eligible for sports, and if I was right in my guesses, that was all my younger self was caring about right now. Maybe there was some truth to what Davey and Sean had always said about this timeline. “That’d be nice, Mom.” I said with a smile. She came back a few minutes later with a ham sandwich that I ate while I continued doing math problems with one hand. For a while she just stood there watching me with a little smile on her face. Part of me wondered just how mean this timeline’s Brian had been to her. “How is the homework coming?” My dad asked from the doorway three hours later. “I’m halfway to being caught up.” I told him honestly. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to work out a bit, take a break, and then maybe work on the rest after dinner.” “How about we go out to a movie tonight and you finish up the rest tomorrow?” Dad offered and I raised my eyebrows in surprise. He smiled at me. “It’s been a while since we did anything as a family, and you’ve been working hard today.” “That’d be nice.” I said and he nodded before shutting the door behind him as he left. By Sunday night, the night before school started, I’d confirmed that my relations with my parents were strained at best. I wanted to curse the Brian of this timeline that had apparently made several bad decisions, but that was impossible. He was as gone as if he’d never existed. Now I just had to pick up the pieces of that life. By the end of the weekend, I felt that I had made a good start, although I almost ruined by starting to ask mom about Uncle Rich. He’d lived to the age of seventy-three in the last timeline, but I’d forgotten that he’d be dead of AIDS in this timeline. He’d died right before Christmas in 1981, and when Dad had brought up the idea of selling his apartment in San Francisco, I’d almost asked about him. Apparently the younger me had wanted to sell it, and they had been resisting doing that for the last few years. Now they’d relented and were ready to put it on the market. They were surprised by my ‘sudden change of mind’. “Here are your keys.” Dad said early on Monday morning, as I got ready for school. He was looking at my clothes with a hint of approval. I’d chosen my clothes carefully, picking a good pair of jeans, penny loafers, a dark blue V-neck sleeveless sweater, and a blue dress shirt under that. “Thanks, Dad.” I said as I took the keys to my re-built mustang. I’d only looked at the car so far, but I knew that Brian Breckenridge of any timeline would love to have that car. “Remember, you’re to come right home after school.” He reminded me sternly and I just nodded, hefting my backpack with all my books and completed homework assignments as I left the house. I’d already kissed mom goodbye for the day. The Downey High student parking lot was the same no matter the timeline, and I pulled into the first spot I found, glad that it wasn’t full yet. To my relief, Brandon and Trevor were waiting in the usual spot near the front entrance. Some things didn’t change, at least. “At least you dressed up for her, but where’s Missy?” Trevor asked after we nodded at each other. “What do you mean?” I asked him with a furrow of my eyebrows. “Dude, you fucking ditch her on Saturday after sneaking out from being grounded, and now you don’t even pick her up like you do every morning?” Trevor snorted. “You better get your ass to pick her up or she ain’t gonna put out for you again!” “Oh shit.” I muttered, turning back towards the parking lot before I realized I didn’t even know whom the girl was or where she lived. I started to turn around, but a familiar figure caught my eye as he passed by us on his way inside. His familiar blond hair was long and shaggy, looking like he’d not had it cut in the last few months. It was still that familiar shade of dirty blond though, and his crooked nose stuck out like it always did. I couldn’t see his eyes from this angle, but I took in the faded jean jacket, worn jeans with holes forming, and sneakers that looked like they’d been too close to a fire all with a single glance. He was also a little heftier than I remembered him ever being, but there was no mistaking him for anyone else in the world. “Hey, Davey!” I called out, leaving my two friends to follow the sixteen, almost seventeen, year old version of the man I loved more than life itself. He turned at the sound of his name, and looked at me as if he didn’t recognize me. That was like a knife through the gut, but I put a smile on my face anyway. Davey stood there, silently looking me up and down, and then at the hand I was now sticking out to him. “You’re Davey Jones, right? Didn’t you play on the freshman team before you moved out to…um…” “Nevada.” He answered in a very familiar bass and I wanted to sigh with relief as he took my hand and shook it. “Brian, right?” “Yeah, so you’re back in town, huh?” “Um, yeah, we moved back last year.” He said. “I’m in the same history class as you.” “Oh, um, well I kept on trying to remember where I knew you from and I just realized it was from freshman football.” I said quickly, wishing I was as good at him when it came to dancing with words on the spur of a moment. “Say, you remember Trevor and Brandon, don’t you?” “Yeah.” Davey said as I tried to steer him back towards them. He looked like he was struggling with wanting to leave and wanting to stay, but Trevor ruined the moment. “Hey, Brian!” Trevor called out. “You better hurry or your girlfriend is going to dump you!” “I’ll see you later.” Davey said as he turned and headed inside the school, hanging his head as he went. His shoulders were slumped forward as he walked, and I wondered what would make my Davey walk like that. I’d always known him to stand tall. Even after his stroke, his first struggle had been to hold his head upright and he’d fought and fought until he could hold his head high on his own. Yes, I realized as I turned to talk Brandon into going with me so I’d know where I was going, there were so many things to fix in the here and now. Chapter 2 It was the slap heard around the world, or at least around Downey High. By lunchtime, the entire school seemed to have heard about the scene in the parking lot that morning. Marcie had come flying out of a car, driven by her older brother and rounded on me as I was just unlocking the Mustang’s driver-side door. Hours later, I could still feel the sting of that slap, and wondered what the hell my younger self of this timeline had seen in her. Sure, she was good looking. Davey had often overlooked the fact that I was bisexual more than I was gay, but then he’d never had cause to doubt my love for him. Physically, I could see why I would be interested in Marcie, but her attitude left a lot to be desired. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” She’d yelled at me after slapping me. “First, you blow me off like I’m nothing on Saturday and then you don’t pick me up this morning, making me get a ride from my stupid brother! What’s going on with you, Brian?” “I’m grounded.” I’d growled at her and she’d laughed in this high, shrill tone, throwing her blond hair over her shoulder. She was dressed in this short mini-skirt and tight top that left little to the imagination. Yeah, she definitely had a good body, but everything else was the shits. “What the fuck is that supposed to matter?” She screamed. “Who cares if your idiot parents ground you? You’re supposed to care about me before anyone else, remember?” “Get a grip.” I’d growled, and had gotten another slap before she stormed off without saying another word. Brandon tried to hide his grin behind a hand, but he got a glare from me as I relocked my door and headed back towards the campus. At least now I wouldn’t be late for school. “Dude, you’re going to have to do a lot of making up to her.” Brandon sniggered and I pushed at him with my shoulder as we walked towards my locker. I just hoped the combination wouldn’t be any different than the one I remembered. It wasn’t, and I put my books away without saying another word. I’d have to break up with ‘Marcie’ before too long, but part of me was reticent to do that right away. Davey’s warnings about making too many rapid changes stuck in my head from the times we’d discussed these aspects of time travel. I didn’t want to end up in a mental institution or a government lab. “Did you forget you’re supposed to take me to lunch?” Marcie’s voice pulled me out of my reverie and I turned to look at her with a frown. Apparently I had the same lunch period as her, and she expected me to take her somewhere. Damn, there went my plans to ‘meet’ up with Davey for lunch. “No.” I answered her, trying to put a smile on my face. At that moment I had never missed my Davey so much. How the hell had I ended up with this bitch instead of the calm, loving man I had just spent seven decades of my life with? “Where do you want to go?” “The usual.” She said flatly. “Aren’t you tired of that place yet?” I asked, trying to get her to tell me exactly what ‘the usual’ meant. “No way in hell am I tired of that place.” She frowned. “Everyone sees us together there so they know you’re mine. I thought you liked that. You told me you did.” “Yeah, well, sometimes the food gets old.” I temporized and she frowned even more. “What’s the matter, Brian darling?” She asked in the most sickeningly sweet voice as she stepped up and put her hand on my chest. I wanted to shudder. “You haven’t even kissed me yet, and now you don’t want to go to Furnow’s for lunch?” “Sorry.” I said as I hugged her and planted a kiss on her cheek. A little voice in my head was yammering about this being a betrayal of Davey and it got louder when she tried to kiss me on the mouth. “Dude, you going to lunch?” Brandon’s voice saved me as I jerked my head to look at my friend. Marcie frowned. “Katie and I thought we might join you today.” “That would be good.” I said quickly, ignoring Marcie’s frown. Katie must be the black-haired girl that was with Brandon. She was petite, but had a fair-sized pair of breasts that looked quite confined in the low-necked blouse she was wearing. God, what was wrong with me and my friends that we were dating girls who thought it necessary to show all their assets? Marcie wasn’t happy about the company, but she looped her arm through mine and practically dragged me towards the parking lot. My dislike for her was getting to be extreme, and as I unlocked the passenger door for her, I debated on whether dumping her would be a ‘small’ change or a ‘big’ one. Davey had always said big changes were bad, but if dumping her was a big one, I might have to risk the consequences. Brandon and his girlfriend got in the back seat, and I had to keep a smirk off my face. Trevor and I were bisexual, although he leaned more towards girls as he got older, while Davey, Sean and Brandon had always been gay from everything I’d heard. Sure Brandon had dated, and had sex with girls in high school of the original timeline (according to Sean), but according to Davey, Brandon had come out in college and never looked back. As we were pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed Davey in a blue Pontiac behind us, and kept on eye on the rear-view mirror as he followed us out of the lot. He turned at the first light though, and I lost track of him. I’d learned that he was in my history class, but he had sat on the far side of the room from me and disappeared as soon as the bell rang. Well, there was plenty of time, I kept reminding myself. Still, it hurt seeing him so young again, and not being able to wrap my arms around him, kiss him, or to talk with him all night long. “BRIAN!” Marcie’s screech reminded me I was driving and I slammed on the brakes just in time to keep from slamming into a car that was stopped for a red light. “What’s the matter with you? You’ve been acting all weird since Saturday! Snap out of it!” “Shut up.” I growled at her, and she glared at me, accompanied by the noise of two people in the back seat sucking in their breath in surprise. “What did you say to me?” Marcie’s voice grew dangerously low as a honk from behind told me the light was green and I started driving again. “I’m not a doormat, you know.” I said with a hint of anger in my voice. “Who said you were?” She retorted angrily. “You do with the way you talk to me.” I replied, enjoying the surge of anger and the tingling it brought to my fingers. I’d forgotten how strong emotions were at this age, and it felt good. “I do not.” She huffed as she crossed her arms just below her bosom. “You better take that back right now if you want to keep my love.” “Stop being such a little girl.” I snorted as a fresh wave of anger came over him. I was too old to be dealing with shit like this. “How dare you say that to me?” She roared and made to move as if she was going to open the door. “If you’re going to jump out of the car you better wait until I can pull over.” I said as they pulled to a stop at another light. “Take me back to the school right now!” She demanded and I was only too happy to agree. I’d barely had time to stop the car in a parking spot at the student lot before she was out the door. She paused while waiting for Brandon’s girlfriend to get out. Katie was making sympathetic noises while Brandon and I got out and I waited for whatever was to come next. Once again I wished for the ability to easily deal with people that Davey had possessed, but that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. “What is wrong with you, Brian?” Marcie demanded angrily after stomping around the car and getting in my face. Spittle flew from her lips and landed on my face, but I resisted the urge to wipe it off. “Nothings wrong with me.” I answered after thinking for a moment. “I just don’t like being treated like a doormat.” “How long have we been going out?” She asked, and I froze, sparing a quick glance at Brandon but he didn’t know I needed his help. Her face grew even redder as the silence continued and she realized I couldn’t answer. “You mean you can’t even fucking remember we’ve been going out for nine months now! I gave you my virginity and you can’t tell me how long we’ve gone out but you can tell me you think I’m treating you like a doormat? Well, I got news for you, Brian Breckenridge. If this is the best you can do, you don’t deserve to be dating me!” She turned on her heels and stormed off, pulling Brandon’s girlfriend in her wake. Brandon leaned back against my car, shaking his head and obviously fighting a losing battle with an urge to laugh. More than a few students had seen the tail end of this show, but I wasn’t as concerned with that as I would have been if I was really sixteen, well sixteen going on seventeen real soon. “Dude, what the fuck is up with you?” Brandon asked after he got his laughter under control. Last week you’re all like ‘Oh, she’s the one, Brandon. I love her. We’re going to get married as soon as we’re out of high school!’ Now you’re like ‘you treat me like a doormat!’ What’s going on, bro?” “You don’t think she treats me like a doormat?” I asked and he chuckled. “Dude, something wrong with your memory?” Brandon asked with a shake of his head. “I told you last week you let her walk all over you and I thought you shouldn’t do that. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t telling you to break up with her, but she’s a manipulative bitch.” “Yeah, she is.” I agreed with a sigh, glad to be rid of her. Brandon just stared at me. “Who are you and what have you done with the real Brian Breckenridge?” Brandon asked with wide eyes. “If I’d called her a bitch last week you’d have stomped me into the ground.” “That was last week.” I replied with a shrug, unnerved by the question. Once again Davey Jones was right. You might think it would be easy to pass yourself off as a younger version of the same person, but it was really difficult. “Yeah, well, you want to grab some food from the cafeteria?” Brandon asked. “I’m starving.” “How much time do we have left?” I asked. “Just over a half-hour.” Brandon replied after looking at his watch. “How about fast food?” I suggested. “McDonalds?” Brandon suggested and I nodded. There was one about ten minutes from here, which would let us get there and actually eat if we hurried, although the idea of snarfing down food that quickly would have been impossible for me before I came back in time, I could remember doing that several times in my first youth. “Isn’t that David?” Brandon asked as we waited at the counter for our order. “Who?” I asked and Brandon nodded his head towards one of the guys working behind the counter. Even with his back to me I could recognize the man I loved. Why was he here, wearing that god-awful polyester uniform and serving up food at the McDonald’s drive-thru? “David Jones.” Brandon said. “You were just trying to talk to him this morning when you were supposed to be picking up your girlfriend.” “Ex-girlfriend.” I corrected him while trying to ponder why Davey was working here at this place. Sure, fast food was a good first job for many high school kids. But this was Davey Jones. He was so much better than this. This guy had saved the world several times, gotten his father from being a dead beat to the office of the President of the United States! Hell, Davey had spent five years as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom for Christ sake! “Yeah, ex and all that.” Brandon said as he chuckled again and shook his head slightly. Our order was done and we went to sit down all without Davey having noticed us. As Brandon chatted about the upcoming baseball season and I grunted a few responses, my mind spun around the fact that Davey was here working on what should have been his lunch hour at school. That bugged me more than I wanted to admit. I could remember Davey talking about his life in the original timeline, and maybe once he’d mentioned working at a fast food restaurant, but that had been lifetimes ago for him. It wasn’t as important to who he was when I’d known him as things like the timeline where he and I hadn’t been a couple until that one kiss right before I was killed at the beginning of World War Three. “Dude, you okay?” Brandon asked. “You know, if you get on your knees and beg, Marcie might take you back still.” “Screw that.” I snorted and Brandon smiled. “Good, can’t say she was my favorite person.” Brandon shuddered in mock disgust and I laughed. “You done?” “Yeah, let’s go before we’re late.” I said. “No worries, we have German, remember?” Brandon was chuckling now. “Frau Hostetter thinks you’re the sweetest thing on earth and would never give you a tardy, even if you showed up five minutes before the end of the period.” “Well, let’s not push her today.” I suggested as we got up and threw our garbage away. “With the way things are going she might be having a bad day and decide I’m the sourest thing on earth.” “Yeah, well that’s what Marcie said after you splooged in her mouth.” Brandon laughed as we went out the door. That shocked me and I stared at him. He realized I wasn’t walking with him anymore and turned to face me with a frown. “Oh c’mon, you know that Marcie tells Katie everything. It shouldn’t be a surprise that I’ve heard about the blowjobs you’ve been getting from Marcie for the past eight months, or about you fucking her last week. She’s not a virgin by the way. She was just saying that to make you think it was something special. She told Katie one time that she’d get you to fuck her and then she’d be set for life, something about getting you to sell an apartment you inherited and then using that to buy a house for her and…” “What the fuck.” I snarled as the conversation with my father about selling Uncle Rich’s apartment came to mind. Could my younger self of this time line have been so fucking blind as to let a bitch use him like that? Then something else struck me. “Damn it Brandon, aren’t you supposed to a fucking friend?” “What?” Brandon asked, obviously seeing my face go red with anger and my hands ball up into fists. “Calm down, Brian.” “Calm down?” I fumed. “You knew the bitch was fucking using me like this and you fucking wait to tell me until I’ve broken up with her? What would have happened if I hadn’t broken up with her? Huh? Would you have stood beside me as my best man at the fucking wedding and fucking smiled while she took me for all she could? Is that how good of a friend you are?” “Dude, public place!” Brandon said in a half-whisper, half-shout. Sure, people were looking, but at the moment I didn’t care. “So god damn what!” I shouted. “Tell me, do you think you’re a good friend when you don’t tell me a bitch is sinking her claws into me and taking what’s mine?” “Would you have fucking listened?” Brandon shouted back, his face going darker with his own rage. “You were all wrapped around her finger. She had her hand on your fucking cock and was leading you around by it with your eyes all glazed over and your tongue hanging out of your fucking mouth! Hell, the only reason Trevor or I ever saw you was when she let you ‘play with the boys!’ You might as well have already been married to her! Trevor tried to warn you one time months ago and you didn’t talk to him for two weeks!” “Okay, you’ve got a point.” I said as Brandon’s words deflated the ballooning anger I was feeling. He did a double-take before his body-posture relaxed slightly. “Sorry.” “So am I, but you’re better off without her.” Brandon said. “There’s plenty of better girls out there, you know.” “I know.” I said as I headed for the car. I waited until we got inside before deciding to drop a bombshell on him. This should be pretty safe, after all Davey had told me that it had been pretty constant in all the timelines. As I started the car I turned to leer at him. “Who knows, maybe I’ll give guys a chance instead of dealing with bitchy women.” “Dude, not even funny.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “As many fags as you’ve beaten up over the years, none of them would think anything except that you were going to stick them in a trash can again.” “Well, there’s always you or Trevor.” I said as I backed the car out and headed back to school. “I ain’t a fag, and neither is Trevor.” Brandon said with a hint of fear in his voice. A quick glance showed that his face was white, not red with anger. “Trevor’s not a fag, he’s bisexual.” I said. “What?” Brandon squeaked and I had to resist the urge to laugh. Suddenly I understood something about Davey, far too late to share with him. Well maybe I could share it with him in a few months, or years, although it wouldn’t be exactly the same Davey. God how he must have loved doing this, letting little tidbits drop to his friends about the future, tweaking their noses with knowledge about them there was no way he should have known. It was fun! “Please, surely you don’t think I had no idea what’s been going on in Trevor’s barn, do you?” My voice was dripping with sarcasm as the anger of earlier leaked out. That was another thing Davey had mentioned but I hadn’t understood until now. Our bodies impacted how we behaved, and the younger body of mine had a whole lot more hormones and stuff floating around in it than the body I’d left in the last timeline. As a result, I was reacting more from emotions than calm, cool, collected planned words. “Uh, I, uh…dude.” Brandon stuttered and the last word was more whisper than anything else. As I pulled into the parking lot, his face was as white as it could be and I decided to take pity on him. “Let’s talk later.” I said with a soft smile. “Maybe during P.E. if we can swing it? I’m still grounded so the old man expects me back home right after school.” “Uh, yeah, sure.” Brandon said weakly as we got out of the car. He didn’t even look at me and I began to regret what I’d done. The difference in perspective was striking, between being openly gay as an adult and in the boiling cauldron that was a high school. I should have realized that, but I’d been caught up in the moment. Now it was too late to undo what I’d done, unless I somehow managed to put together a time machine, but that was an impossibility. It was just after Algebra II that a thin brown-haired girl wearing a skimpy top and very tight jeans accosted me. She had a bright smile on her face and was trying to simper like Joan Collins from Dynasty, but it wasn’t working on me as she stood in my way. Her name flowed up from long-forgotten memories of another time. “What is it, Laurie?” I asked her after she hadn’t spoken but stayed in my way. “Is it true?” She asked. “Did Marcie really dump you?” “I hope so.” I said before I could catch the words from forming on my lips. Her smile grew brighter. “So you could like, ask someone else out now?” She asked with a perkiness that was altogether too fake for me. “I’m grounded by my parents thanks to her.” I answered, barely registering the pouty expression on her face before stepping around her and heading to my locker. I passed Marcie in the hallway and got a glare from her as she saw me, but that didn’t stop her from storming over to me. “I need to get my things from your locker, asshole.” She demanded in a voice that cut over the buzz of students passing by us in the crowded hallways. “Fine, I’ll put them in a box and have Katie give them to you.” I replied and she started to say something but I moved off too quickly for her. The whole situation felt weird, like a page out of someone else’s life, which it was in a very real way. Davey and I should have been a couple for two years now. It was time for P.E. and for me to have my ‘chat’ with Brandon, and probably Trevor. Both of them were giving me sharp looks as we changed for class, but when it came time to line up for roll call I received my first surprise. Coach Cole, who was the former Navy Master Chief I remembered from the last timeline was calling out roll and he called out Davey’s name twice before shaking his head and muttering to himself. This P.E. section was usually for guys who played on sports teams. It let us leave school earlier for away games, and also kept us from being as able to pick on the little guys. That was something I remembered clearly. I also remembered Davey telling me he hadn’t played sports in this original timeline after coming back to Downey, so why was he in this class? Another important question, since I’d just seen him at work during lunch was he skipping class in order to work? I remember he dropped out sometime this year, and he’d claimed it had begun when he needed to work more hours, but this was the first day of school after Winter Break. “Okay, we’re doing basketball today.” Coach Cole said. “Let’s get through the warm-ups and then we’ll divide you up into teams.” That effectively killed my plans to chat with Brandon and Trevor. They knew it as well and Brandon gave me a terse ‘after class’. Maybe I could get away with being a little bit late getting home. If not, well screw it, this was a little more important at the moment. Halfway through the period while I was taking a breather on the side of the court and Brandon was in the game, I got a chance to approach Master Chief Cole. He was watching the game and making some ticks on his clipboard. There were actually three games going on with the size of the class, but he was the teacher on our court. “Master Chief, can I ask you something?” I asked and he stared at me for a moment. “You planning on joining the NJROTC, Breckenridge?” Cole asked with a little bit of humor in his eyes. “I’ll be honest, we could use someone like you. Last semester there were barely enough kids to keep it going. Think you could convince your two buddies to join as well?” “I…uh…I’ll talk to them.” I stuttered with surprise. I’d forgotten how… pushy he could be about his NJROTC. I also remembered that Davey’s sister had been a big member of that group in the last timeline. Yeah, that would be good. “Good, we’re meeting tomorrow after school.” Cole said with a nod and I realized how easily he had drafted me. Oh well, I still remembered how to march just fine and all the other crap that went with his little club. Besides, it’d give me more time away from grounding. “What about when baseball starts?” I asked as another thought struck me. “You’re going out for the team this year?” He asked with surprise. “You skipped it last year.” “Yeah, well, Marcie and I broke up today.” I said with a shrug, deciding there were a lot of things I could blame the girlfriend for. “Hate to say it, but I think that’s a good thing.” Cole said with a shudder. He had my full agreement on that. “Anything else?” “Yeah, when you called out attendance, you shook your head at the fact that Davey Jones wasn’t here…” I let my voice trail off and he gave me a sharp look. “I didn’t know you were friends with him.” Cole answered after a moment of silence. “I…I’m not. Yet.” I answered honestly. “I knew him a bit back when we were freshmen and he played on the football team.” “He any good?” Cole asked and I had to think for a moment to how Davey described his football abilities in this timeline, not necessarily how it had been in ours. “He could be if he made the effort and had some help.” That answer should be accurate. “Well, he won’t be eligible to play anyway the way he’s going right now.” Cole said with a grimace and he gave me a long look. “Breckenridge, I don’t know why I’m going to tell you this because at the end of last year I’d pretty much written you off as a pussy-whipped boy without a brain of your own, but you strike me as having changed a bit over the break.” “More than you can imagine.” I muttered and almost regretted it when I realized he heard what I said. That got me a look of curiosity, but he shrugged it off when I didn’t offer anything. “So, your friend, Jones.” Cole said softly. “He pulled a ‘C’ in this class last semester because he was at the limits of excused absences already. His absence today makes him even with the number of excused absences for the entire year. If he misses three more days, or fifteen individual classes like he’s been doing, he’ll get expelled.” “For missing classes?” I asked with surprise and Cole nodded. “It’s in the student guide, Breckenridge.” Cole answered. “He got suspended two weeks before finals and I think he was happy about it. If he doesn’t turn his head around and start paying attention, he’ll be out the door and in alternative education by the end of the month. His mom’s probably getting a phone call personally from the principal right now.” “Oh.” I said, dumbstruck by the news. “It’s time for you to get back on the court.” Cole said, ending the conversation. I made a couple of stupid mistakes in the game, mostly because my mind was spinning with the news of Davey’s problems at school. Until now, I’d been thinking I had plenty of time, weeks or months to get to know him and encourage him to make some good changes, but now… now I knew I didn’t have that much time at all and I was still grounded. “Let’s go.” Brandon said fifteen minutes later as everyone else was milling about the locker room, getting ready to take showers. He and Trevor had just kept on their P.E. sweats as they met me at my locker. I just nodded and followed them out after putting my clothes into a gym back and looping it over my shoulder. There was a mess of people leaving, so we made our way to the baseball field’s dugout where they sat on the bench and stared at me while I leaned back against the metal bars on the field side. “So what’s this shit about you thinking we’re fags?” Trevor said with a frown after we’d all remained silent for a while. “I never said it like that.” I said defensively. “You’ve never used anything but fag or fudgepacker to talk about people like that.” Brandon pointed out. “Since when have you used anything else?” I shot back as a flash of anger welled up. A deep breath calmed it down. Damn it to hell, I was an adult, not a kid! “Look, let’s calm down here. We’ve been friends for half our lives already, right?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with his eyes squinting at me and his arms crossed. “Of course as soon as you and Marcie started going out it was like we ceased to exist unless you needed us for something with her.” “Then let me say I’m sorry about that.” I said with a frown. “I was stupid to let anyone, especially a bitch like that put our friendship in danger.” “You mean it, don’t you?” Brandon asked with his head cocked to the side and a look of surprise on his face. I nodded. “Fine, I accept your apology.” “As long as you don’t do the same thing with another bitch.” Trevor added with a hint of sulkiness. “You don’t have to worry about that, Trev.” I said with a smile and he smirked at me. “You really turning queer on us?” Trevor asked with a smirk. “If I was, I’d trust the two of you to be cool with it.” I said with a smile but they frowned at that. “I don’t know why you think…” Trevor started to protest while Brandon looked at the ground but I interrupted him. “You two started doing it with each other the summer before seventh grade, right?” I asked and they both looked up at me with shocked expressions. “Jesus, Trevor, your parents aren’t stupid people. Do you really think they missed you going out to the barn?” “They know?!” Trevor’s voice actually cracked at that. “They told you?” “No, but they’ve guessed.” I said with a shrug. “You know, they have to be cool about it if they haven’t said anything.” “Dude, your parents know.” Brandon’s voice was a hoarse whisper as Trevor shook his head. “I’m never going to be able to look them in the eyes again.” Trevor mumbled before looking up at me. “Dude, if you’ve known, why didn’t you ever say anything? I mean, I’m not really queer, you know, but I do like getting it where I can. I guess you could say I’m tri-sexual you know…I’ll try anything at least once…” “Yeah, okay.” I said with a nod and a smile. “Whatever works for you bro. It’s your business, not mine, okay?” “Yeah.” Trevor grunted. “Dude, you’ve always hated queers or anything smacking of stuff like that. What’s changed you?” “I can’t really say.” I said, not really wanting to lie to them, but neither did I want to tell them everything yet. They were different people than those I’d known for so long before. It would be smart to get to know them a little better. “I remember the first time I heard you say the word ‘fag’.” Brandon said softly, his eyes meeting mine after a long moment. “It was about this time of year during seventh grade. You came back from Christmas Break and you were like really pissed off. When I put a hand on your shoulder you told me ‘stop that fag shit’ and to leave you alone.” “I remember that.” Trevor said. “We thought you weren’t going to be friends with us anymore, but you started hanging out with us again later that month.” “My Uncle Rich died that Christmas.” I said with a heavy sigh. That was one story Davey had told clearly, how during his first time travel, what he called the second timeline, Uncle Rich had died as well only he’d been there that time. “I’ve never heard of him.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “I think I remember you talking about going to see him during the sixth grade.” Trevor said with a glazed look in his eyes as if he was trying to remember. “You never mentioned him again, though.” “My mom and dad always thought it was best if I didn’t mention my gay uncle at school.” Brian said, remembering that from his own childhood and guessing it applied here. “They weren’t ashamed of him, but they didn’t want me to get into fights when other kids said something bad about him if they knew I had a gay uncle.” “That makes sense.” Brandon snorted. “Yeah, well he died from AIDS that Christmas and I got a little angry.” I said, guessing from knowing how I would have reacted if my Uncle Rich had died. “Oh, shit, I’m sorry dude.” Brandon said as he stood and moved to put a hand on my shoulder. There were tears in my eyes as I realized that in this reality, I wouldn’t have Uncle Rich around like he’d been until I was in my sixties. Brandon ‘s hand stopped halfway to my shoulder, and he looked like he was afraid for a moment, but I solved that for him by reaching out and bringing him into a hug. A moment later Trevor joined us. “So this is what’s been bugging you ever since then?” Trevor asked softly. “Yeah.” I answered. “Sucks, don’t it?” “Yeah.” Brandon replied. “I know thinking about getting that fucking thing scares me shitless sometimes.” “That’s why you cover your stump before you hump.” I joked as the hug broke up and we all grinned at each other. “So did Marcie turn you off girls so much you’re going to do guys now?” Brandon asked. “I think you should keep it quiet if you, you know. I’m not about to have everyone think my best friend’s a fag.” “Is that why you went after that Jones guy this morning?” Trevor asked with a thoughtful look on his face. “I mean, I’m not sure how you’d know that he and I did the deed last semester, but he does have a pretty hot mouth.” “Dude!” Brandon laughed. “I had him give me a blow job freshman year. You remember when he was on crutches after Ruiz tackled him in practice? The day after Brian and Jay Collins threw that kid who had freckles all over his body into the trash can, my mom gave him a ride home and I stayed there for most of the night. He blew me while I laid back on his waterbed. It was pretty good.” Their words, each and every one of them struck home as I listened and tears came to my eyes again. My Davey… we’d been virgins that first time, or at least he’d physically been a virgin. I knew in his first life we’d never ended up with each other, but I’d never thought he’d have done it with… our friends. Had he secretly looked at them while we were dating and remembered what he’d done with them? “Brian?” Trevor’s voice got my attention. “You okay bud? That didn’t gross you out did it? Or are you upset because you thought you’d be the first to bag Jones?” “Um, I’m fine.” I said after clearing my head with several deep breaths. No, it was as much my fault as anything Davey might have done. If I’d gone back further, to 1981, maybe, I could have stopped all this from happening. Instead, I had to deal with the world as it was now, and go from there. Davey had done all these, and probably more, in the original timeline and still ended up with me in the second, and had stayed faithful to me, except the time I rejected him. No, I couldn’t let what I’d just heard poison my love for him. He had told me once that a lot of the things he went through as a late teenager, after his father’s arrest had made him the man he was when he went back in time. I couldn’t begrudge those experiences altogether, could I, if they had produced the man who’d made me so happy for so many years? “So, what now?” Brandon asked in worried tone as he looked at me. “I mean, Brian, you’ve been a good friend, but what does this mean?” “Who knows?” I asked in a voice almost as soft. “As far as I’m concerned, the rest of the world doesn’t need to know our business, right? We’re friends, good friends, and what we share with each other doesn’t go no further, right?” “Right.” Brandon and Trevor said in unison. “Now I have to go.” I said with a smile. “I’m already supposed to be home and I’m still grounded.” “See ya tomorrow, Bri.” Trevor said, patting me on the back as I took off from the dugout and headed back out to the car. It was as I was driving off that the location of our talk triggered a memory of another talk, and the things that had been said. Almost, I turned around to tell my friends the rest of the story, remembering Sean, but I didn’t. There was too much else going on right now. Chapter 3 “Your mother says that you were twenty minutes late getting home today.” Dad said as we sat at the dinner table, eating honey-glazed chicken with rice and steamed vegetables. My mother’s cooking was something I’d really missed without realizing it as the years had gone by in the last timeline. There were plenty of times when I’d had a bad day and come home to make something like this, something that reminded me of being a kid, protected by my parents’ love. Davey always called it comfort food. “Yes, I was.” I admitted cautiously, unsure of where he was going from the neutral expression on his face. “You did well this weekend, Brian.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “I want to hear what you thought was a good enough reason to risk ruining that progress by being late today.” “I… it’s been an eventful day.” I answered honestly. They just frowned at me for a moment and I let out another sigh as I sat back, trying to meet both of their eyes while twiddling my fork around my plate. “Marcie and I broke up.” “You don’t seem too heartbroken.” Dad said while both of them struggled to not smile over the news. “I thought… I thought after the reason you were grounded that you were going to go on and marry her once you’re out of high school.” “No way in hell.” I growled, surprised at the vehemence that came with the thought. “Watch your language, son.” Mom said, but there was no anger or sharpness in her voice, and her lips were quivering upwards. “I can’t believe I ever dated someone like… her.” I said even more vehemently. They were both smiling openly now. “Why didn’t you stop me?” “We tried.” Dad said with a sigh, and although his lips quirked downward for a moment he didn’t sound too angry. “Was she pushing you to sell the apartment?” “Yes.” I admitted, shaking my head. “I’m just glad I woke up in time. That apartment… it’s all I really have left of Uncle Rich in this world, isn’t it?” “Brian!” Mom’s voice sounded shocked, but there was a very soft smile on her face and tears in her eyes. “That’s the first time in years that you’ve mentioned him without cursing or looking like you wanted to hit something!” “I’m sorry mom.” I said softly, apologizing for the behavior of the ‘me’ from this timeline. “I… well sorry doesn’t cut it… but I miss him too.” “I do too, honey.” Mom said sadly. “We knew you were hurting from losing him, but every time we reached out to you, you turned us away.” “But that’s in the past now, I think.” Dad said with a tone of approval and he looked me over. “I think you’ve done some growing, and while I don’t approve of what brought this all to a head, I do approve of the results so far. We can forgive you being late since you were dealing with breaking up from a bad relationship.” “Actually, that was dead before lunch was over.” I said with a snort, remembering how… angry the cow had been. “Then why were you late?” Dad asked patiently. “I… I was talking with Brandon and Trevor about things.” I answered honestly, hoping he wouldn’t ask too many details. “I haven’t been the best son to you over the last few years, and I haven’t been the best of friends to them either.” “Now that’s an even better reason to be twenty minutes late.” Dad said with a smile that surprised me. “So, what else is going on with you?” “Master Chief Cole’s expecting me to join his Sea Scouts this semester.” I began and they looked confused for a moment. “You mean Coach Cole from your football team?” Dad asked. “Yeah.” I confirmed. “They’re having problems getting enough students, and well he asked me to join and I’m thinking about it. I’d need permission obviously, and well, it would mean coming home later a couple times a week, and probably leaving a little early as well.” “Are you doing this to get out of being grounded?” Dad asked and I shook my head. “Grounding won’t last little more than a week while the Sea Scouts thing goes on all semester and maybe even next year.” I answered him and he shrugged. “Good, because if you’re going to do it, you’re doing it all semester.” Dad said while mom nodded her agreement. “Anything else?” “Yeah.” I said as I shifted in my seat and played with the remaining food on my plate a little bit more. Suddenly I wasn’t very hungry and I was wondering if I should even discuss this with them, but they were my parents and I knew they could always help. “What is it, Brian?” Mom asked with a slightly worried frown. “I saw someone I haven’t seen in a while.” I answered. “He went to La Loma with Brandon, Trevor and me and he played on the freshman football team with us before his family moved to Nevada. He’s back at Downey now, and well, I don’t know how to describe it, but he looked kind of down, you know?” “What’s his name?” Mom asked with a tilt of her blond head. “Davey Jones.” I answered and she creased her eyebrows. “That sounds so familiar.” Mom muttered while Dad frowned. “Was his father a preacher?” Dad asked and I knew he recognized the name. “Yes.” I answered and Dad sighed. “Honey, you remember the story from last year.” Dad said to Mom. “David Jones Sr. was a local pastor who moved out to Nevada until his wife found out he was molesting their daughter. He came back to California and pled guilty to the molesting and was placed on house arrest.” “That’s right and there was something in the paper yesterday about him being arrested for violating the terms of his parole.” Mom said as she slapped her hand on the table in triumph. “He went too close to a school or something like that. Funny, they never mentioned he had a son.” “Yeah, well, Davey, I don’t know.” I said softly. “He’s not the same as I remembered him, like he was all hunched in on himself. Plus, he’s working at a McDonald’s near school, and missing classes because of it. Coach Cole said if he doesn’t start going to all of his classes soon they’ll kick him to alternative education.” “What does this have to do with you?” Dad asked. “I… I feel like I’ve spent the last few years being selfish, you know?” I answered, trying to sound as young as possible instead of older, wiser. “I saw Davey today when all the stuff with Marcie was going down and well, I began to wonder. We kind of knew each other years ago, and he’s a pretty cool guy, but since he came back he’s all withdrawn. Before… without Marcie, I might have tried to be a friend and maybe he wouldn’t look so… defeated.” “What do you want from us?” Dad asked. “An extra two hours after school before I have to be home?” I asked and Dad’s face started to cloud over. It was time to speak quickly. “If you’re willing to give me an extra two hours, I think it would be fair to also extend my being grounded a week.” “Even if that means you can’t have a birthday party?” Mom asked. “Yeah.” I agreed. “What about the Sea Scouts thing?” Dad asked. “The afternoon stuff counts as part of the extra two hours?” I offered. “The morning stuff counts as school time?” “Deal.” Dad said with a nod of his head. “Thanks for letting me bargain.” I said with a smile and he laughed. The rest of the evening passed pretty quickly with me spending most of it on homework. Assignments from the first day weren’t too bad, but there was a lot of little things I had to review from the last semester so I would be current on what was being taught. Towards the end of the evening, I watched the Cosby Show with my parents, experiencing déjà vu from watching the old program that was now being run for the first time in this timeline. All the while my mind was plotting out different ways to reach out to Davey in this timeline, the way he’d reached out to me. It would have been so much easier to just bump into him like we’d done on the bike path in my own timeline, but that was years ago even here. No, something else was required, and I had to remember something else Davey had said about how he’d been in this timeline. Very, very closeted. His sleeping with Brandon and Trevor, as well as several other guys most likely (and even one or two girls from what he’d told me one time) was all one-time affairs. Most of the people he slept with during high school he never talked to again, from what he told me. That was probably one of the reasons he wasn’t friends with Brandon or Trevor, because after having had sex with them, he actively kept them at arms-length. He’d never exactly explained why, but I guessed it had to do with him not wanting to admit he was gay. So long as he wasn’t faced with daily reminders of his ‘weakness’ in having slept with them, he was able to pretend like it never happened until the next time. That would fit something I’d heard from many gay men who’d grown up in the eighties. It was also something I’d have to help Davey overcome eventually. No, for now I’d have to work at just being his friend and nothing more. That night I dreamed about Davey, as might be expected. Only, the Davey I dreamed about was the man I’d grown old with. After his stroke, he’d lost control of his bodily functions and so it had been necessary to put an adult diaper on him when he came home. I think, more than anything else that had embarrassed him deeply. I’d seen it in his eyes, and the way he tried to protest every time I carefully removed a fouled diaper, cleaned him up, and then put a new one on him. Sometimes he’d close his eyes and stretch his head back as if pretending it wasn’t happening, and other times he’d look at me with eyes that provided a glimpse into his tortured soul. I knew Davey Jones and the proud man he’d been, and I knew how much his need for help with even the most basic of needs shamed him. That was why I would never let anyone else change him, and made sure the physical therapists got him to the point that he could sit on a toilet again. He still needed help transferring from the wheelchair to the toilet, and I still wiped his butt for him, but he no longer had to wear the diaper. Those were small victories, but each of them had helped rid his eyes of that shame, and restored to me the proud man I loved with all my heart. In my dream, though, the look in Davey’s eyes was the same, but his body was that of the teenager I’d seen the day before. The dream was still fresh and vivid in my mind as I showered the next morning and dressed in a nice blue and white striped shirt with a pair of nice stonewashed jeans. Yes, Davey had always had a great amount of pride, and I could well imagine how much of a beating it was taking right now. Way back in 2006 of the last timeline, a scandal had erupted just forty days before the mid-term elections. On of Davey’s Aunts, from his mother’s side, had been arrested in Las Vegas for a pyramid scheme and embezzling money from a property management company she worked for as a manager. It was only another scandal, this time on the Republican side, which had ended the relentless attacks on President Jones for the illegal acts of his sister-in-law. It was the closest to an outright scandal that they’d had to deal with, and I’d seen a look of hurt in Davey’s eyes. The night of the election, we’d both gotten drunk off our asses at our D.C. home and he’d told me how much he’d always hated that aunt. Apparently she’d caused countless problems for him in the original timeline, and was someone he actually despised. He’d also shared how awful his family had been in that timeline, which was now the timeline in which I was living. The mirror on the back of my door helped me to make sure that I was looking good today. I couldn’t help whistling as I grabbed my car keys and left my bedroom. Mom was in the kitchen, and Dad was at the table with a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I grabbed a glass of orange juice and the cereal mom had out on the counter and sat at the table to eat. “Good morning.” Dad said as I sat down. He put down his paper long enough to find another section and push it in my direction. “There’s something in there you might want to read.” “Why do I have the feeling it’s not going to be good?” I asked rhetorically. It was the Metro section of the Modesto Bee, and below the fold it had a picture of David Jones, Sr. as well as a headline of “Former Pastor Released”. Davey’s father had been released from jail after it had been found that he’d not violated the terms of his parole. He was living with his mother, who lived a block from a school. The parole officer on his case had authorized him to live there, and he’d been on his way home from the neighborhood store when a police officer had arrested him. “Ah, crap.” I murmured, feeling sorry for Davey and his family for having to constantly go through this crap. The only reason the paper paid any attention to this was because Davey’s father had been a preacher. Then again, if something like this had happened in the last timeline, there would have been an even greater furor. “You still thinking of trying to be friends with him again?” Dad asked as I finished reading the paper and set it back down. “Yeah.” I said with certainty that was far firmer than he had any clue of it being. “This only makes me feel worse, you know? He’s been going through all this crap and I don’t see him hanging around other people at school. It must be pretty lonely.” “I’d imagine a lot of people wouldn’t want to be associated with someone whose father was in the papers for this kind of stuff.” Dad said and I nodded my agreement while chewing on some cereal. “I have to be off to work, but good luck.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. “Honey, you know you can invite him over anytime you want, even if you are grounded.” Mom said as I finished my cereal and took it back to the sink. “Are you sure?” I asked, surprised at how nice they were being. Then again, these were my parents, bleeding heart liberals, and I should have known better than to be surprised. It seems I’d forgotten just how caring they were. “Definitely.” Mom said with a smile. “I feel like I’ve got my old Brian back.” If she only knew. “There you are!” Marcie was not the sight I wanted to see this early in the morning on the front steps of the school. She was standing there with Brandon and Trevor, as well as their girlfriends Katie and Lisa, both friends of Marcie. Today Marcie was dressed in another mini-skirt, with a tube top barely covered by a jean jacket and more of that Madonna-style lace crap. She must have wasted at least ten bucks of make-up on her face as well, and I had to squelch the desire to tell her she was looking like a cheap whore. Instead I just approached the group while keeping an eye out for Davey. “Good morning.” I said in as neutral a tone as possible. “I wanted to talk to you.” Marcie said. “I’ve thought it over, and I’m willing to give you another chance if you apologize to me in front of our friends. You better make it good though if you want me to forgive you and take you back.” “You’re kidding, right?” I said as a laugh escaped my lips. She gave me a death-ray style glare while putting her hands on her hips. Oh my, she was not amused at all. “What the hell’s gotten into you?” She nearly screeched as one of her hands ended up waggling a finger in my face. “You’re like a totally different person! Don’t you remember how important you are to me? You need to treat me better.” “Shut up.” I growled as I slapped her waggling finger out of my eyesight. She seemed shocked enough by that, and her mouth flopped open. “You listen to me for a moment, woman. I’m not some toy you can play with when you feel like it, and I sure as hell am not about to spend the next forty years working my ass off so you can sit on a couch watching soap operas and eating bon-bons like Peggy Bundy! If you thought I was your meal ticket to an easy fucking life, you sure as hell should have treated me better than you have been. As for taking you back, you can apologize all you want but I want nothing more to do with you!” “Fuck you!” She yelled. Her face had been getting redder and redder as I yelled, and I was relieved that was all she had to say before she stomped into the school. Katie and Lisa followed her, and I was left with my two friends, who were both staring at me like I’d gone crazy. “What?” I snapped at them and relaxed as Trevor started to snigger. “Dude, that picture you painted of her on the couch… that’s fucking classic!” Trevor said around his sniggers. “Just one thing, who is Peggy Bundy?” Brandon asked as he started to chuckle. “Oh, yeah, um just somebody I made up.” I said with a shrug. Damn that was right, Married with Children wasn’t on television yet. Oh well, it still worked to drive her off and make sure she had no illusions that it was still possible to get back with me. Several dozen people must have heard me yelling at her. “Dude, you know she’s going to be a bitch for the next few weeks, don’t ya?” Trevor asked and I nodded. “So will our girlfriends.” Brandon said. “We might have to join you in exploring the dark side.” “Your choice, dude.” I replied with an easy smile. “The only thing is, I think both of you have already been there a lot more than me.” “Let’s head inside.” Trevor said and we followed him into the school. The girls weren’t in sight and I sighed with relief as we headed to our lockers. Both of theirs were near each other while mine was in another hallway. To my surprise, Davey was there, just a few feet down from Trevor’s. “Hey Jones.” Trevor called out. “Hey.” Davey said cautiously, his eyes glancing to the three of us. “Hey, I heard your dad was in the paper the other day.” Brandon said in a teasing tone and rage surged through me as I saw Davey turn white before looking away in shame. He slammed his locker shut and started to turn at the same moment I swung out with my arm and elbowed Brandon so hard he flew against the lockers with a loud clatter. As I faced Brandon and used my forearm to pin him against the lockers, I noticed Davey turning back to look at what was going on. “Dude, that is so fucking uncool!” I nearly shouted as my face flushed with my anger. Brandon had a surprised look on his face, as did Trevor. From this position I couldn’t see Davey, but that wasn’t important. “What?” Brandon gasped out. “How could you be so fucking mean?” I asked, surprised at the way I was cussing. It wasn’t something I’d done much of in the last few decades. “Mean?” Brandon gasped as I relaxed a bit and removed my arm from his throat. He straightened up a bit, grimacing as he stretched his back. “Dude, those fucking locks probably left a mark on my back! What the fuck did you do that for?” “You fucking pissed me off.” I fumed. “How the fuck could you do that to someone?” “Do what?” Brandon asked. “What you said to Davey.” I reminded him and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I just mentioned the article about his father.” Brandon stated. “What’s the big deal?” “How the hell would you feel if your family’s business was plastered all over the paper?” I asked him and Brandon looked like he didn’t understand. Neither did Trevor for that matter. “Dude, what the fuck’s gotten into you?” Trevor asked, moving to stand next to Brandon. I took a quick look around in time to see Davey’s back as he disappeared around a corner, while there were several other students watching us in the quickly filling corridor. “Think about what it must be like from his perspective.” I urged my two friends in a hoarse whisper. “Imagine if it was your father in the paper like that and everyone around you knowing the shit that was going on in your family.” “My father would never have done something like that.” Trevor snorted. “Mine either.” Brandon said with disdain. “Besides, if he’s going to go all sensitive every time someone mentions his father he’s going to have a lot of bad times before he graduates.” “Especially with idiots like you around.” I said furiously, ignoring the look of hurt on Brandon’s face as I spun around and stalked down the hallways towards my locker. My mind was spinning with a lot of thoughts, but most of them centered around Brandon and Trevor. They had been our best friends growing up, always there with us, always supportive and strong. How much of that had been because of Davey’s influence on us? Sean’s as well, but I had to wonder just how much of what I viewed as our moral strength during high school had been because of the influence of the two time travelers? How much change could I make in my friends who were currently stereotypical high school jocks more interested in the next game and dipping their dick in a hole than in understanding people? By the time history class rolled around, I hadn’t come up with any definitive answers, but I did know that I would be staying away from Trevor and Brandon for a while. They’d been giving me odd looks all morning, and from the way their girlfriends were whispering to them in the hallways between classes, I was quite convinced they were being given some ultimatums. Up until I walked into the history classroom, I was ready to mark the day off as a complete failure. A question to a girl in my last class who also had this class had confirmed that there was no set seating assignment, so when I saw Davey sitting in a desk against the wall closest to the door, I took the seat behind him and immediately turned so my back was on the wall. He sat in his desk normally, and had hunched his shoulders as soon as I sat down. The teacher was standing at the blackboard, writing something on the board while more students filed into the classroom. A thick-set geek with brown hair gave me a dirty look when he saw me sitting where I was, but didn’t say anything as he found another seat. “You ever wonder if George Lucas sat in one of these desks?” I asked of no one in particular, although I was facing the girl who had been in my last class. Ronna, that was her name, and if I remembered correctly she was a friend of Davey’s in this timeline as well as the one I came from. She’d been there when I first met Davey, well besides that baseball game. “Huh?” She asked. “You know, George Lucas.” I said, grateful that someone at least had responded. Davey was still hunched forward, but out of the corner of my eye I saw him shift slightly in his seat. “The guy who made Star Wars and American Graffiti.” “I know who he is.” Ronna said with a hint of scorn in her voice. “Why would he have sat in one of these desks and why wonder about it?” “These desks are old enough to have been here when he was.” I said with a snort and she actually giggled. Davey’s shoulders started to move like he was on the verge of laughing. He was wearing the same jean jacket as the day before, but the jeans he was wearing today looked to be in better condition, although he still had on the half-melted tennis shoes. “They probably were.” Ronna agreed with me. She had long, dark hair and was pretty. She was a little hefty, but not too badly overweight. “I knew someone who went to school with him.” Davey’s voice was almost inaudible, but he turned slightly in his seat to look at Ronna and then me. His face was devoid of any expression, as if he was afraid of what would happen if he showed something. “She lived on a ranch a couple miles down from my house back in Nevada. Her husband taught me how to ride a horse. She said she thought Lucas was nothing but a weird freak in school and now she wished she’d asked him out.” “I bet she does.” I said with a laugh and almost regretted it when he winced for a moment before a slow smile formed on his face. That was the moment the bell chose to ring and it was time for class. As the instructor turned around and I began to read the assignment on the board, I wondered just how the Brian of this timeline had ended up in a college-prep History course. Sure, some of the classes were college-prep, but not all of them were as they were when I had gone through high school. Whatever the reason, I was just glad that I was in the class with Davey as I turned to face forward in my seat. “On the board is the outline of your semester-long project.” Mr. Wansor said in a bored tone. “Be sure to write it down accurately as it will account for half your grade this semester. You may work on this individually or in pairs, but I warn you that if you choose to work with someone there will be no changing partners or going solo unless one of you dies. You will note that there are several due dates for this assignment, the first in just three weeks when you will turn in an outline of your project. Missing a deadline reduces that portion of the grade by one step. Each deadline counts for five percent of your grade on the project with your final presentation being ten percent. Instead of a written final in this class, you will give your project presentation. Now that you’ve written the assignment down, let’s open our textbooks to page thirteen and start with a discussion on the second Constitutional Congress.” The class was a typical one with the teacher trying to drag answers out of the students and getting monosyllabic answers instead of the erudite philosophy he probably dreamed about getting. Deep down I felt sorry for him, and halfway through class I raised my hand and gave him a five-minute answer to one of his questions. Then Ronna spoke up to argue about something I said, and to my surprise Davey responded to her statement by defending my point about the inclusion of slavery being necessary for that time and place, no matter how disgusting it was as an institution. That got Reggie, who I remembered from the football team involved when he called Davey a ‘racist’. Before I could defend Davey on that topic, Davey snorted and shook his head before shooting Reggie a look of contempt. “If you can’t listen to a white guy talking about the institution of slavery with honesty instead of bleating only about the horror of it, then maybe you should take a deep look at yourself.” Davey’s voice dripped with sarcasm that was so familiar I started to get hard. This was a glimpse of the Davey Jones I knew, cocksure to a fault, and full of derision for people whose viewpoints he disdained. Sure, Davey had hidden it a lot, but there had been more than a few times over the years that he’d unleashed it at people. His ambassadorial confirmation hearing had been one such event, when he verbally lashed out a freshman Republican Senator who was trying to make a name for herself. Davey had figuratively picked her up, spanked her bottom and sat her back down gently while extracting a promise from her that she’d behave like a grown up instead of a schoolyard bully trying to look good for the cameras. “Oh yeah?” Reggie said angrily. “I ain’t the one sittin’ here defending slavery.” “I am not defending slavery, as you would know if you bothered to really listen to what I’m saying.” Davey said. “Slavery was, and is, a horrible crime on the conscience of humanity. That doesn’t change the fact that if the founding fathers of this country had tried to get rid of it back then, there wouldn’t have been a United States today, nor a United States that would fight a bloody civil war during which the abolition of slavery would occur!” “I think that is enough for the moment.” Mr. Wansor ended the debate in a stern voice, but there was a smile on his face. The bell rang at that moment and Reggie was one of the first ones out of the classroom, giving Davey a glare as he left. Davey let out a long breath before picking up his books. As he stood, his shoulders slumped again and the breath of life that had filled him during class seemed to drain away with his exhalation. “Hey, Davey, wait a moment.” I called out as I picked up my own books and rushed out after him. He stopped long enough to turn around and glare at me for a moment. “It’s David.” He said in a low voice. “What?” I asked, confused for a moment. “My name, it’s David, not Davey.” He explained. “Oh, I thought…” I stammered. “What are you trying to do?” He asked, oblivious to the stream of people filling the hallway and trying to get past us. “Huh?” I asked although I had an idea what he was getting at with that question. “First this morning, and then you sit next to me in class using Ronna to strike up a conversation with me.” Davey said, showing me that no matter what had happened to him in this timeline, he was still as observant as ever, and as clever in figuring out why people were doing things. That was always one of his best gifts, being able to figure out people’s motivations with just a few words and some observations. “What kind of game are you playing with me? You’ve been in classes with me since the Seventh grade and have never shown this much interest in talking to me, not even when we played football together freshman year.” “I…” I wanted to tell him everything in that moment, but there was a little voice holding me back and it wasn’t just because we were in the middle of a crowded hallway with people all around us. “I’ve been thinking.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” He asked with a very familiar edge to his tone. Davey was getting angry. “It means I’ve kind of known you since seventh grade, except for when you were in Nevada, and I realized I really had never gotten to know you.” I started to explain in a wavering voice. His blue eyes were ice cold as he stared at me. “Why now?” Davey asked me angrily. “If you’re going to try to tell me it had nothing to do with that article, you’re crazy. I know you and your friends. You all love teasing people because of shit like that and if you think you can trick me…” “No!” I said vehemently, although my voice was barely more than a whisper. He must have seen how much I meant that because his head jerked back and he blinked. When he opened his eyes again, they were less angry, although he still had a wary look about him. “Then what?” He asked and I let out a long, slow breath. “I… when I saw that article, something inside me wondered what it would be like to be in your situation, with my family life spread out for everyone in the damn world to read.” I said quickly and as quietly as I dared to in the noise hallway. A guarded look filled his face now. “And?” He asked in a dangerous tone. “I kind of remembered that you were always a smart guy, and you seemed to be pretty cool when you were on the football team with us.” I said with a shrug. “You want to work together on the history project?” “Why would I want to work with you?” He said with a hint of sneer in his voice. That hurt, but I wasn’t going to show him how much it hurt. This was awful, I was standing here talking to the man I’d just spent some sixty-odd years living with as a husband, a partner, and now we were like strangers. No, we were strangers in more ways than one. I wanted my Davey, and it was only the look of love I’d seen in his eyes every night as I lifted him from his wheelchair and put him in our bed before crawling in and holding him tight that kept me from giving up at that moment. “Why are you here?” I asked and his eyes narrowed suddenly. “What do you mean?” Davey said as he switched from attack to defense. “Why are you here at Downey High?” I asked him, having remembered something very important. It had been at his mother’s graveside, and he was crying as he buried her yet again, but unlike other times he’d buried her, he was crying tears of joy and recollecting every time that she’d done something wonderful for him in all the timelines. There had been many things, and only a few about this, the original timeline, but there had been one very big thing she’d done for him, something he’d never really thanked her for until just before she had died in this timeline. “I…I live in the district…” He said defensively. “You know, in the articles it talks about your mother living in Ceres.” I said calmly, noting how his eyes widened. “Your sister, shouldn’t she be a freshman? Why isn’t she going to school here?” “That’s none of your business.” He said angrily and started to push past me, but I grabbed his arm and pulled him in close so I could whisper in his ear. “I think you came back because your friends from before are here.” I whispered quickly before he could pull away from my grasp on his arm. “You’re here because the people you went to elementary school, junior high, and freshman year are here. I heard your voice when you spoke about Nevada. You miss it a lot. Where did you go to school last year? You moved back here in November of 1984, but you didn’t come back to Downey until this school year. I bet you went to Ceres High, which is where your sister is going now.” “Shut up.” Davey whispered, but his tone was defeated and he didn’t bother trying to pull his arm out of my grip. His head was hanging down though, and I was willing to bet there were tears in his eyes. That made me feel bad, but it couldn’t be helped just yet. “What are you going to do?” “Why’d you come back here, to this school, Davey?” I asked him again, still just a whisper in his ear. “You know why.” He said and his shoulders heaved as he fought against a sob. “Tell me, please.” I almost begged. “I thought I had friends here.” He said bitterly. “Except for Ronna and Jeanette, though, there aren’t any here. While I played around at being somebody in Nevada, y’all moved on with your lives and I’m left in the fucking dust. There, you happy?” “No.” I said softly as I released his arm. He turned to look at me, and there were tears in his eyes, along with an angry glare that was fueled by confusion. “Then what?” He demanded in a low, angry voice. “You going to make me do your project for you like Ronna and Jeannette make me pay for their alcohol so they’ll hang around?” “No, we’re going to do this project together.” I told him with as mild an expression as I could put on my face. Oh, how I wanted to take him in my arms and wipe away those tears. “Let me tell you what I’ve been thinking. Your old man dragged you out to some backwater town in Nevada where he’d be a big preacher. I remember you in freshman football. As soon as your ankle healed from that bad tackle you were going to be back on the team and you had plenty of drive to get on second string, if not first. You had some friends, some decent friends here. Then you got dragged to bumfuck Nevada and had to start over.” “Are you a fucking mindreader?” Davey whispered with a look of shock replacing the anger on his face. “This town you lived in, was it big?” I asked and he shook his head. “Less than five hundred people in the entire fucking town, maybe as many people in the entire county as go to this school.” Davey answered. Yeah, that fit what I remembered of him telling me. “So you went from being another fish in the pond to being the big fish in the little pond, right?” I asked and he nodded his head after staring at me for a long moment. “Now you’re back to being just another fish in the pond and you don’t even know all the fish anymore because they’ve changed just like you have, and to make matters worse your father’s in all the papers and not in a good way.” “You are freaky.” He said in a whisper and I smiled. “Yeah, but I’m thinking I’d like to get to know you.” I said with that smile still on my face and I could see something melt in him before his shoulders slumped again. “Why?” He asked. “Sounds like you’ve figured out my pathetic life.” “Because as I was thinking about this, I realized if I was in that situation I’d want someone to be friends with who just might understand what I was going through.” I said calmly and he gave me a guarded look. “I also realized that while I may not understand everything you’re going through, I do understand some of it and maybe I should try and make friends with you. Lord knows anyone who’s been through shit like you have has got to be someone worth knowing. I’d be wanting to slit my wrists about now.” “Who says I haven’t?” Davey asked sarcastically and my heart nearly stopped at that thought, but then he’d lived long enough in this timeline to make it to 2004 alive. “So, we going to work on the project together?” I asked him and he nodded after a very long moment where I held my breath. “Good, I’ll see you in P.E., right?” I asked him. “Yeah, but I go to work right after.” He said softly. “Okay, see ya, Davey.” I said with a smile and walked off, not daring to look backwards. Had I said too much, or not enough? Only time would tell. Chapter 4 “You have to admit it looks pretty queer even if people don’t know what you said to us last week.” Trevor said in a way that totally set me off. “What the fuck did you tell her?” I yelled at him. We were in the middle of the nearly deserted parking lot. Both Trevor and Brandon were facing me, their body posture defensive. P.E. had ended long ago, and I’d just finished the afternoon’s NJROTC meeting only to find my two ‘friends’ waiting for me by my car. Davey hadn’t even waited for the end of P.E. before heading back into the gym and changing into his regular clothes. His car wasn’t in the parking lot when I came out, which I’d pretty much suspected since I’d stayed longer in the shower trying to calm down. It had been such a wonderful day from the moment I’d woken up this morning. Turning seventeen wasn’t supposed to be that big of a deal. Seventeen was the year between when you could get your driver’s license, and the year that you legally became an adult. There was just something about it though, at least for me this time around. Not many people could say they’d turned seventeen twice in a lifetime. My parents had even relented on my ‘birthday party’. It was just going to be a few friends, and of course my parents, but Davey would be there. He’d even asked for the night off of work, something he was really reticent to do, but he’d done it and that made me happy beyond belief. Davey had met me at the library after school twice now to work on our history project, and was starting to unwind a little around me. He’d been surprised when I asked him to come to my birthday party, protesting that he had to work. Money was tight for him, and he was working at three different McDonald’s restaurants in order to make his car payments, his insurance payments, and still have money for things like food and gas. His mother wasn’t working now because her back pain was so bad, and there were still the payments for his sister to go see a psychologist. The state had stopped paying for them, and his Nanny didn’t have the money for them since she was helping Davey’s mom by giving them a place to live, buying groceries, and helping to pay for the surgery Davey’s mom was going to have in a few weeks. Still, he was taking the night off so he could go to my birthday party. “Nothing about that stuff.” Brandon broke into the argument with his own angry look. “She’s just hurt, Brian, and she’s lashing out. Marcie thought you loved her and you just turned around and dumped her like that.” “Last week she said she dumped me.” I groused. “Yeah, well she’s a girl.” Brandon said with a sigh. “We’re not getting it any easier, you know. Our girlfriends are upset because she’s upset and they’re digging for why you won’t just apologize to Marcie so it’s all over. Add on that you’re now hanging around Davey and some of his freaky friends and everyone’s wondering. Reggie’s pissed at him because he’s a racist…” “He’s not a fucking racist.” I growled. “Reggie’s blowing things out of proportion just like Marcie is doing. How about his faggot comment in P.E.? That wasn’t exactly unbigoted, you know.” “Everyone hates queers, you know that.” Trevor said with a snort, earning a glare from me, but he didn’t say anything about my glare while Brandon looked off into the distance for a moment. “Look, it was you who said you were interested in Davey that way, and pretty soon people are going to figure it out. We don’t have to say anything. They’ll just assume you two are faggy on each other and go from there. You’re not acting at all like yourself, Brian, and you know that damn well.” “Well maybe I just fucking woke up and realized I wanted to be better than I’d been.” I snarled while resisting the urge to lash out at them. What made me really sick is that all these little popularity games in high school didn’t really end after graduation. They just changed, and grew more vicious. Kind of like the difference between playing poker with pennies and playing high stakes poker with a million dollars on the table. I’d lived in Washington D.C. for far too many decades to deny that the popularity games of high school were not reflective on the real world. “What the fuck was wrong with how you were before?” Brandon snorted. “I don’t know what’s going on in your head, Brian, but you better wake the fuck up. You’re doing that stupid Sea Scout thing, making friends with Jones and his freaky friends, and you’re totally ruining your reputation! Are you even going out for baseball this year?” “Of course I am.” I snarled. “Look, I just know I can be better than I’ve been lately.” “Don’t you remember what we promised each other back in seventh grade?” Trevor asked in a softer voice. “Yes, I remember.” I told him. “We decided we were going to be the baddest dudes in school and we’ve been that.” “Yeah, and now you’re fucking it up!” Trevor snarled. “Maybe I’m realizing there’s more than one way to be the best in our school.” I said angrily as I pushed past him and unlocked my car. “Brian.” Trevor said and then stopped as I got in the car and slammed the door. The engine started right up and I roared out of the parking lot, not caring if they got stung by loose gravel thrown up by my spinning tires. I was angry, as angry as I could ever remember being at my friends. Then again, they weren’t really my friends. I’d always known Davey had a positive affect on us in the last timeline, but this was just ridiculous. Brandon at least had always been more considerate of other people’s feelings while Trevor could be downright oblivious at times. Still, he’d never been so… arrogant before. I was relieved though when I pulled up in front of my house and saw Davey’s car out front. It was a Pontiac J2000; something I never even knew existed before. Still, there was no mistaking Davey’s car since the front-end was smashed up a bit. It wasn’t bad damage, just very noticeable. He’d had the accident just after midnight one weekend, having gotten off work late. He’d worked sixteen hours that day, he’d told me a couple days ago. Technically, it was a violation of the state’s child labor laws, but he got away with it because he’d only worked eight hour shifts at two different restaurants in town. That worried me, how he was working so much. It was taking away from his studies, and I knew now for a fact that most of the time he missed classes in school he was working because someone had gotten sick or quit and they’d called him to come in and work early. Then again, he was calling them every morning before he left for school to see if they needed the extra help. I parked my car behind his, leaving the driveway for my father and went inside the house. Davey hadn’t been over here before in this time line, but I knew my mother had been getting anxious to meet him so it was no surprise he was sitting in the dining room, having a soda while talking with my mother. “Brian, you’re home!” She said with a smile. “I found this young man here sitting out in his car waiting for you to get home, so I told him he had to come inside.” “Hi Mom, hi Davey.” I said with a smile while mom frowned. “Davey?” Mom asked. “Only Brian calls me that.” Davey said with a sigh. “Everyone else calls me David.” “Oh, I see.” Mom said with a curious little half-smile on her face. “Well, I’ll just let you two boys go do your thing while I finish getting things ready for Brian’s birthday party. Brian, did you know David’s birthday was last week? You boys are less than a week apart in age.” “Really?” I asked feigning surprise and wondering just how she’d managed to get that information out of Davey. I’d tried to get him to admit his birthday but he’d flat out told me it was none of my business. He was blushing now. “Yes, so now you’re going to have to go shopping with me so we can get him a nice present, even if it is after the fact.” Mom said before sailing out of the room. “You don’t have to do that.” Davey said softly. “Dude, forget the protests.” I said with a chuckle. “You’ve given Mom an excuse to go shopping and there’s no way in hell she’s going to give up a shopping trip just because you don’t want to be embarrassed.” “Oh.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “So…um…” “I’m sorry about P.E.” I said quickly and he shook his head. “Let’s not talk about that.” He said as he stood up. “I was wondering if you wanted to work on the history project. We’ve got the deadline for the outline coming up and I don’t want to drag your grade down by missing it.” “That sounds good.” I said. “Let me show you my room.” While we sat and debated different things for the history project, I couldn’t help but relax and feel like things were going better. Here, in my room where it was just the two of us, I could actually feel us growing closer. At school, Davey walked around with hunched shoulders, meekly flowing around the crowded hallways so he wouldn’t bump into people or bother them. If people wanted to talk or interact with him, they had to dig deep to get a reaction and it took a lot more effort than most high school students were willing to give. Yesterday, a guy whose first name I knew was Todd had stopped me in the hallway to say he’d seen Davey actually talking to me and how he thought that was ‘cool’. “I tried when he first showed up last semester, but it seemed like he always had something else he’d rather be doing.” Todd had said. “We were pretty cool in junior high, but he like totally disappeared freshman year.” The Davey I’d known in the previous timeline had decades of memories and experiences behind him and had been one of the most articulate and well-reasoned people I’d ever known. This Davey, the one sitting in my chair while I sat cross-legged on the edge of my bed, didn’t have those years of experience and memories to draw from. Despite that, while we talked about our history project, I was finding that he was just as articulate and well-reasoned. Sure, he wasn’t quite as able to pull up quotes and historical references, but he was the rough diamond that had become the well-polished diamond I’d known. A part of me wondered if that was how he’d seen me in all the different timelines as he’d gotten to know me again and again. “Boys.” Mom said as she knocked on my closed door. “Yes?” I called out and she opened the door just enough to stick her head inside. “Your dad called, Brian.” She said to me. “He’ll be home in about twenty minutes. We’ve got reservations for five o’clock at Marlucci’s so you boys should get ready. Davey, do you need to call anyone before you go to dinner with us?” “I…um…I can just go home.” Davey said hesitantly. “There’s no need for you to…” “Nonsense.” Mom said with a snort. “You’re coming to Brian’s party after, right?” “Yes.” Davey said slowly. “Good.” She stated with an emphatic nod of her head. “You’re here now and it makes no sense at all for you to go home only to come back later for the party. We made the reservations before Brian and Marcie broke up so you can just take her place.” “Thanks, mom.” I said while trying not to break out in laughter. Would she remember that line when Davey and I were finally a couple and came out to her? “Just remember you need to be wearing slacks and a nice shirt.” Mom said. “Oh.” Davey said a little crestfallen. “Don’t worry, we’re about the same size.” I said as Mom closed the door behind her. Sure, this Davey wasn’t nearly as in-shape as I was, and he had a bit of gut over his belt, but there should be something in my closet to fit him, and we spent the next ten minutes getting him into a pair of slacks that were a bit tight but still fit, and a dress shirt as well as a nice sweater. He was a little hesitant changing in front of me, and I frowned at the sight of the ragged underwear he had on, but we were dressed and ready to go by the time Dad arrived. Yes, I did notice the sly looks he gave me as I stripped down to my briefs before getting dressed. That was a good thing on all accounts, and I took extra time changing just so he would get a bit of a show. Yeah, I was going slowly with that aspect of our budding relationship, but there was no reason why I couldn’t show him what he’d get one day. Dinner was great, which wasn’t surprising since it was one of the best Italian restaurants in Modesto. Davey looked really uncomfortable at the start as we all perused the menus. He even tried ordering something relatively inexpensive, but I stepped in and talked him into ordering something a little higher up on the menu, something I knew he’d enjoy more. Dad and Mom both looked on with approval. As we all munched on mozzarella patties, my Dad started in on trying to draw Davey into conversation. He was subtle about it, first asking me questions about how school was going, how the NJROTC was going, and my plans for sports in the upcoming months. I’d played baseball every year since I was seven, except for skipping it last year, and he knew what I was planning on doing, but I knew he was getting me to talk first before he started asking Davey questions. “Well, what about you, David?” He asked Davey after I’d talked about my hopes that maybe this year Downey’s baseball team would win more games than we lost. “How is your semester going so far?” “It’s okay.” Davey said with a shrug as he quickly stuffed some cheese into his mouth and chewed while my father looked at him with a smile on his face. “Are you going to go out for any sports?” Dad asked him when he was done chewing. “Um, I can’t.” Davey said cautiously before taking a swallow of ice tea. “Oh, why not?” Dad asked him with a lift of his eyebrow. Like me, both my parents were blond but it was obvious I got my dark eyebrows from my father. “I have to work.” Davey said after a long pause and a glance at me. “Oh, that’s just too bad.” Mom said with a frown. “Young people should be able to enjoy their last few years of high school before they have to work.” “Yeah, well, my family needs the money.” Davey said with a shrug. “That’s right, Brian mentioned your mom was having major surgery in a few weeks.” Dad said and I hoped Davey wouldn’t get upset. He gave me a glance I couldn’t quite fathom, but he nodded at Dad’s statement. “Yes, they’re going to try to fix her back.” Davey said. “Nanny, that’s her mother, is paying for it so money’s really tight now.” “What’s wrong that they need to operate?” Mom asked. “Brian didn’t really give us too many details.” “Well, you see she’s had scoliosis since she was thirteen.” Davey said calmly. Apparently talking about his mother’s condition didn’t quite make him as uncomfortable as talking about his working. “They didn’t catch it until it was too late and after a really tough operation she ended up having a hump on her back. It means she gets tired easily and is always in a lot of pain. She also can’t breath that easily, so she gets winded pretty quickly. The surgery is supposed to help with that.” “What are they going to be doing?” Mom asked and Davey warmed up to the topic. “They’re going to break her ribs loose, reposition them and then reattach them to her sternum.” He answered, oblivious to the way Mom’s face went slightly white. “They’re also going to do something with her spine, help straighten it out some. She’ll still have that hump on her back, but it’ll be half the size it is now and she’ll have better lung capacity. The doctors say it should help her be able to work again. Right now she can’t stay on her feet more than a few hours without downing so many painkillers she goes loopy.” “Oh my, it sounds painful.” Mom said softly. “That’s what they say.” Davey agreed with her. “Mom’ll be in Children’s Hospital for at least a month while she recovers and then another four months recovering at home before she can expect to work again.” “Well, thank goodness for disability.” Dad said and Davey frowned. Dad saw it and reacted. “Don’t tell me they’re trying to not pay her disability.” “They’re saying it’s an elective surgery, not mandatory.” Davey answered. “Besides, we haven’t been back to California long enough for her to qualify since she’s only had one job and that was only for three months before the pain was too much for her.” “That’s just not right.” Mom said with a hint of anger in her voice. Davey looked surprised to hear that. “Don’t they understand she has a family to support?” “Yeah, well, we moved back in with my grandparents.” Davey said with a shrug. “It’s a little crowded with Shantill living there with her daughter, but Mom and Jenny share a room while Shantill sleeps in the middle bedroom. Nanny and Papa dote on her daughter, Whitney, and put her in the bed with them every night.” “Where do you sleep?” Mom asked, beating me to the question. “Papa converted the garage into a living room when they bought the house back in the sixties.” Davey answered. “So now you get it as your bedroom?” Dad asked with a smile. “Kind of.” Davey answered and I frowned. “My bed is behind the couch, and I’ve got a dresser I can use for my clothes, oh and I’ve managed to fit my stereo in next to the bed. As long as I wear headphones I can listen to it all I want, and Nanny and Papa usually go to bed after the 11 o’clock news so it’s not too bad. Plus, they make pretty good alarm clocks. They both get up around six in the morning and when they turn on the kitchen lights it’s even better than having an alarm clock. Papa put in these fluorescent lights over the dining table and when they turn them on in the morning they’re bright enough to wake me right up.” “I see.” Dad said slowly, and I could see the tightness around his eyes. This was… Davey had never mentioned this to me in our last lifetime. Maybe it was something he’d long forgotten, judging from the suddenly bitter expression on his face. The food arrived, saving him from further grilling by my parents for at least a few minutes.",

      "content": "“David, honey, did you say your mom was going to be at Children’s Hospital?” Mom asked after a few minutes. “Yes, in San Francisco.” Davey answered after he swallowed a bite of his food. “You’ll be going up to see her, of course.” Mom said. “Yes.” Davey answered although he frowned slightly. “I can’t miss much more school and Mom’s forbidden me from going up there during the week, but I plan on going up there all weekend long while she’s there. Nanny’s trying to find a hotel room she can afford so she’ll be up there all the time and Jenny gets to go for the day of Mom’s surgery and the day after. I wanted to go, but they’re saying I’ve missed too many days of school this year.” “Coach Cole said you’d be sent to alternative school if you missed more than one more day.” I said quickly, so my parents knew the score on that matter. Davey grimaced at me, but didn’t object. “Brian, would you object?” Dad asked and I knew right away what he was going to suggest. Without hesitating I shook my head. “Davey, has Brian told you about his apartment that he owns?” “You own an apartment?” Davey asked with surprise as he turned to look at me. “Yeah, it used to belong to my Uncle Rich.” I answered. “He left it to me when he died back in ’81.” “Oh.” Davey said with a weird look on his face. “It’s in San Francisco, and currently not occupied.” Dad said, drawing Davey’s attention back to him. “We’ve kept the furniture that was in it when Richard passed away and have rented it out to students and other people who don’t have a lot of their own furniture. Only thing is, right now there’s no one in there and the last few people who’ve applied we haven’t really liked. There’s no reason, if Brian agrees, that we couldn’t leave it vacant until your mother’s surgery and allow your grandmother to stay there, and of course you and your sister could stay there too when you go up to visit your mother on the weekends.” “That would be nice, but Nanny won’t just accept charity.” Davey said with a sigh. “Then we’ll charge her a fair rate.” Dad said with a smile. “If you want, you can tell her about it sometime this week and have her call Brenda to discuss the details.” “I’ll do that.” Davey said and paused for a moment before getting a look on his face that I knew was his ‘woops, forgot something’ look. “Um, thanks, all of you.” “You’re welcome.” Dad said with a smile and gave me a sharp look. “Brian, take notes from this guy. He sure knows how to be polite.” “Yeah, whatever.” I said with a typical teenage eye roll, although sometime soon he was going to get a big hug from me for being so generous. That seemed to end the subject of Davey’s family life for a bit, and not once had they brought up Davey’s father. While my parents began to tell the typical funny stories from my childhood, stories I blushed at like a typical teenager, I could see Davey relaxing. His shoulders weren’t hunched up anymore. He was sitting back in his chair, and a smile was on his face the entire time. I laughed as well, and listened with interest as the stories reached the point where I was older than twelve. From the stories they told after that point, it became clear that was where my life of this timeline diverted from the one I remembered. Meeting Davey along the bike path on the way to the first day of the seventh grade seemed to be the key difference. We skipped desert and headed back home, all four of us smiling as we left the restaurant. My parents seemed to genuinely like Davey, something that despite the last timeline I’d been a little nervous about. If things went well, and Davey once again ended up with me, there should be no problems with them accepting him as family. Dad already seemed protective of Davey in a way that I totally hadn’t expected. No one else had arrived by the time we got home, which wasn’t all that unexpected. We had another twenty minutes before the party was supposed to start. While Mom worked on the last little touches for the party, Dad gave Davey a tour of the house, including the old weight set in the garage. I could see the sparkle of interest in Davey’s eyes that he quickly suppressed. That encouraged me a bit, considering his current lack of physical fitness. He at least harbored a desire to work out again, and if he was given the chance, probably would. Trevor was the first to arrive, pulling up on his motorcycle. Brandon showed up not more than two minutes later, and the other three people I’d invited arrive moments later. Mom had been surprised by the modest number of people I’d invited. Apparently, last year I’d had nearly forty people over. Despite the fact that I’d told people to not bring gifts, Brandon had a small gift-wrapped package in his hands and everyone else had cards. Even Davey produced a card from somewhere. It was awkward for a few minutes as they all stood in the living room while my mom brought the cake into the dining room. Davey’s friend’s, Ronna (who was in our history class), Jeannette (the thin brown-haired girl whose braces had finally corrected her buck teeth), and the thin, red-haired boy Todd who I’d spoken to at school all stood behind Davey. Brandon and Trevor stood near me, looking at the three they didn’t really know. “Where are the girlfriends?” I asked my two friends. I’d invited their girlfriends out of politeness. “They wouldn’t come.” Trevor said sourly while looking over the two girls standing next to Davey, now talking to him quietly. “This is from Marcie.” Brandon said as he tried to hand the package over to me. I flushed with anger at that. “Take it back to her.” I said. “No, I’m not playing gofer for you two.” Brandon snarled as he threw the package down onto the couch. “You give it back to her tomorrow at school.” “Fine.” I said with a sigh as I scooped up the package and put it on the fireplace mantle. I turned to Davey’s friends then, giving up on Brandon and Trevor for the moment. “Thanks for coming.” “Thanks for inviting us.” Jeannette said with a smile that caused me to worry for a moment. “How about all of you come in the dining room?” Mom called out. “The cake’s ready.” What followed was a very uncomfortable forty minutes as they sang happy birthday to me and I blew out the candles before Dad cut the cake. My parents really saved the night by asking all sorts questions of the three people they didn’t know, and dragging both Brandon and Trevor into the discussion at different points. I was actually relieved to see Brandon and Trevor leave early. Certainly the explanations of how Ronna, Davey, Jeannette, and Todd all knew each other was a lot freer and more enjoyable. Todd had some funny stories of Davey in an eighth grade math class they’d shared. I’d never heard the story of crazy Mrs. Dent, her good guy/bad guy explanation of multiplying negative numbers, nor the funny story about sticks of Big Red gum being exchanged behind her back. Considering Todd’s red hair, I had to wonder if he’d been making passes at Davey all that time or if they’d actually done something together. That made me slightly jealous, and I debated on whether I should have invited him or not, but realized there was nothing I could do about it if something had happened. It was just as much my fault as it would be Davey’s. We had still bumped into each other, according to Ronna’s story about the first time she ever saw me, but there had been no conversation. In my timeline, I’d actually bumped into Sean, but Davey told me that the first time it had been him I’d bumped into. Still, in this time, we’d never chatted, never became friends. I’d apparently walked off without a word except for my angry exclamation at him that he’d ignored. It was almost funny how one little thing could cause such a big difference. “If you kids would like to go out and ditch the old folks, we wouldn’t mind.” Mom said after another twenty minutes had passed. That surprised me since I was supposedly still grounded, but Dad nodded his agreement. “Just be back by midnight, son.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. They’d given me some nice gifts, new clothes and a new watch that was pretty cool. “I know just the place to go.” Ronna said with a smile as we headed out of the house. “I’ll drive.” I offered and everyone agreed. Davey sat in front while the other three piled into the back of my Mustang. Following Ronna’s directions we ended up at a deserted park near the river. After I parked the car, we all piled out and Ronna led us to some bench tables that were actually near the water. Jeannette was carrying a backpack she’d come into the house with and she produced two thermos bottles as we sat down. “What did you bring?” Davey asked with far too much excitement in his voice for my comfort. I wasn’t born yesterday, and put teenagers, dark location near a river, and thermos bottles together and I came up with some kind of alcohol. “Screwdrivers, just the way you like it, Davey dear.” Ronna said with a smile. “Cool.” Todd said with a smile. Davey was sitting next to Ronna with Jeannette on the other side and Todd was next to me on the other side of the table. Jeannette handed one thermos to me and the other to Davey. “Drink up birthday boy.” Jeannette said with a dazzling smile. “Uh, I’m driving, I shouldn’t drink.” I said softly. “Oh, c’mon, at least one sip.” Ronna said and I shrugged. One sip wouldn’t hurt. “Oh god.” I said moments later as I coughed. The shit was strong, too damn strong! “Like a touch of orange juice with your vodka, do you?” “Blame Davey.” Ronna said with a laugh as Davey handed her the thermos while I handed mine to Todd. He took a deep gulp, shook his head after swallowing the awfully strong drink and handed the thermos over to Jeannette who took a deep swig. “So what do we do now?” Todd asked. There was just enough light from the moon to see that his eyes were already starting to get glassy. Damn that shit was strong! “It’s a birthday party.” Ronna said with a smile. “How about Truth or Dare?” “Oh god, not that again.” Davey groaned after his fourth swallow of the foul concoction. “What? We haven’t done that in years!” Ronna protested with a laugh. “Yeah, last time you ended up daring me to kiss Mardi McFarland and she followed me around all eighth grade like she was convinced I was going to marry her.” Davey groaned. “She still would if you asked her out again.” Jeannette jibed with a laugh. She pulled out a silver pin and put it in the middle of the table. “Okay, here’s a pen we can use since both the thermoses are still full.” “Um, aren’t we a little old for this?” I asked, not totally sure I wanted to be doing this, especially at the rate they were drinking. Todd was halfway drunk already, and Davey looked like he had a good buzz going after his fifth drink from a thermos. “Oh, these are not going to last long at all.” Ronna said with a frown at her thermos. “You sure you don’t want more, birthday boy?” “That’s fine.” I said with a frown. “Good.” Ronna replied, taking another sip while reaching out and spinning the pen. The pointy end stopped facing me and I suppressed a groan while Ronna giggled. “Truth or dare, Brian?” “Truth.” I said, not wanting to be dared to run around the park naked, which I was sure she would have done given the look in her eyes. “Oh you’re no fun.” She moaned. “So, who really broke up with who, you or Marcie?” “She dumped me, but I wanted her to.” I answered sourly and all four of them laughed. “Your turn.” Ronna said with glee and I spun the pen. It landed on Todd. “Truth or Dare?” I asked him with resignation. He actually seemed to think about it for a moment before mumbling ‘truth’ to me. I was feeling a bit pissed and my mouth shot off before I thought about what I was asking. “So do you like Big Red ‘cause it lets you make a joke about your cock?” “Um, um, yeah.” Todd said as his face blushed a bright red and the other three at the table burst out in laughter. Davey almost fell backwards from his laughing and Todd glared at me before spinning the pin. As fate would have it, it landed on Jeannette who demanded a dare. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” Todd said immediately with a triumphant gleam in his eyes as he looked at me before taking the thermos from Davey. Jeannette squealed in happiness and leaned over the table towards me. She got her kiss, and it was a decent one on my part, although she slobbered way too much. It was nothing like kissing my Davey, who was currently sniggering at me. Jeannette’s spin landed on Ronna, and Ronna was dared to kiss me. She was definitely better than Jeannette, and quite good at using her tongue, but again she wasn’t Davey. “Dare.” Todd said with a wicked smile when Ronna’s spin landed on him. Ronna’s answering smile spelled trouble and she proved it immediately. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” She said in a wicked tone. Ronna and Davey burst out in laughter, leaning against each other while Todd looked stricken. He gulped and looked at me hesitantly while I let out a groan. “Oh come on, it’s just a game!” Ronna nearly shouted amidst her laughter. “Am I going to have to kiss everyone at this table?” I growled, setting off a fresh round of laughter. I was irritated at the childish game, but I grabbed Todd’s head with both hands and brought him in for a kiss, tongue and all. After a surprised moment, he returned the kiss, to my surprise, and he was better than either of the girls had been. I broke the kiss when I started to harden. The slacks I was wearing wouldn’t hide an erection for long. “Oh, that was priceless!” Jeannette giggled. “I wish I had a camera!” “Spin.” I growled at Todd who was licking his lips and looking at me in a way that made me uncomfortable. Had he enjoyed the kiss? His spin landed on Davey, and Davey let out a groan. “Don’t tell me, you dare me to kiss Brian.” Davey said with what I was hoping was just mock horror. Todd squeaked out a ‘you bet’ and Davey looked at me expectantly. We both leaned across the table, and my body tingled as our lips touched for the first time in this reality. Despite the smell of vodka and orange juice on his breath, it was a wonderful moment as our lips touched and our tongues sought each other’s mouth. It ended all too soon, and I sat down in a hurry when I realized I was now fully erect. “Oh god, that was just too fucking hot.” Jeannette murmured while Ronna shot me a look that could only be described as jealousy. Davey was hunched over in that now-familiar gesture that something had embarrassed him. If he was as hard as I was, which I hoped, then I could understand his posture. He took a very long gulp from a thermos before spinning the pen, which landed on Jeannette, who was now looking thoughtful. “Truth.” She said, changing the tempo of the game. At that moment I was very thankful for that. “Have you ever gone all the way with a guy?” Davey asked her and she blushed. “Yes.” She answered and quickly spun the pen again. It landed on Ronna and Jeannette smiled quickly when Ronna took a dare. “Ronna, I dare you to go for a walk with Davey for at least ten minutes.” “That’s easy.” Ronna said as she got to her feet, only slightly unsteady, and pulled Davey up before taking his arm and walking off towards some trees. “Oh thank God.” Jeannette said as she swallowed some more alcohol. “That was the whole purpose of that game. Sorry you had to kiss two guys on your birthday, Brian.” “Don’t worry.” I said with a shrug. “What do you mean that was the whole purpose?” “Oh, it’s just that Ronna’s been interested in Davey for years and she’s finally gotten the nerve up to tell him.” Jeannette said. She was slurring her words slightly, and Todd was taking another long pull from the other thermos. “She’s going to tell him she likes him and ask him to go out with her. I think she’s hoping to get some action while she’s out there, too.” “Oh.” I said with shock, not sure how to react. Yeah, Davey was gay, but he could still choose to date her and pretend. It wasn’t like he was out or anything. Only a hand on my thigh broke that jealous thought and suddenly I was faced with another problem. The hand could only be Todd’s, and when I didn’t react immediately, his hand slid further up my thigh until it was cupped over my erection. Jeannette had turned her back to us and was watching the river that glinted with reflected moonlight. It was all to surreal for me, as Todd squeezed my erection and I sideways glance revealed a smile on his face. His red hair was longish, and curled around the edges of his pale neck in a way that was suddenly very attractive. Part of me knew it was my seventeen-year old hormones talking, but with Davey off in the trees with a girl he’d known for years and years, and showing no real interest in me beyond friendship, it was almost tempting. Almost, but not quite. I reached down with my hand and gently pulled his off of my crotch. He frowned, and started to look worried, but the soft smile on my face, a squeeze of his hand and a wink put him at ease as I placed his hand on his own leg instead of mine. He let out a sigh as I turned to ask Jeannette a question. The rustling of trees in the distance interrupted me, though, and Davey stomped back over to the table, an angry look on his face. Ronna followed a few seconds later, looking both angry and hurt while Jeannette started to mutter a few curses. There was a tense moment at the table until Davey spoke. “We have school in the morning.” He said in a tight voice. “Brian, you mind dropping us off?” “Sure.” I said flatly, wanting to ask what exactly had happened, but I was also relieved that I knew at least one thing. Davey had not reacted well to whatever Ronna said. It was weird dropping the girls off because Jeannette lived so near the house that I’d always thought of as being Davey’s home. It was empty in this timeline, and my eyes misted over at the thought of all that I had lost from the last timeline. Then again, I’d been an old man there, and my days with Davey Jones had been coming to an end. In a few years we’d both have been dead, and now there was the possibility of another lifetime with him, no matter the troubles that we faced now. “Todd’s house is just a few blocks away.” Davey said and gave me directions. When I pulled up in front of it, he got out with Todd. “Happy birthday, Brian.” Todd said softly. “I had a good time.” “Thanks Todd.” I replied with a genuine smile. “I was glad you could be there.” “Thanks again, Brian.” Davey said as he shut the door and leaned in from the outside. That confused me. I’d planned to have him stay the night since he couldn’t drive with as much alcohol as he’d consumed. “We can get a ride with Todd’s mother in the morning. Would you mind giving me a lift back to your house in the afternoon so I can pick up my car?” “Uh, sure.” I said softly and he smiled before turning to follow Todd in the house. They were inside the nice home for several minutes before I pulled away from the curb. The memory of Todd’s hand on my erection was all too recent and played a major role in my dark thoughts of what would be happening in that house tonight. I knew Davey had no problem with sleeping around in this timeline, and I knew Todd at least played for our team a little bit, and that combination had me imagining the familiar body of Davey’s locked in wild passionate sex with the cute red-head instead of with me, the way he should have been. By the time I got home and inside, the tears in my eyes were more than enough to obscure my vision. Fortunately the parents were in bed, so I could escape to the safety of my bedroom, throw myself down onto my bed and cry myself to sleep over should-have-beens. Chapter 5 “Hey.” I greeted Davey as he sat down in history class.He just mumbled a response, and I was torn between my jealous feelings and sympathy. His eyes were bloodshot, and he was wearing the clothes I’d loaned him for dinner last night.Ronna shuffled in a few moments later, also with bloodshot eyes I noticed as she glared at Davey before sitting on the other side of the room. Davey didn’t even notice her glare, as he was hunched over his desk and fiddling with a notebook. “You doing okay?” I asked Davey quietly after we’d sat there in silence. “Just hung over.” He mumbled. “We didn’t ruin your birthday, did we?” “No.” I lied. “Good.” He replied as the bell rang and Mr. Wansor began the class.He looked disappointed that today there was very little discussion despite his best efforts. I, for one, didn’t feel like adding anything of my own because I was still seething over last night, and Davey going to Todd’s instead of coming home with me. Part of me wanted to be fair, I hadn’t invited Davey to spend the night, but still, him and Todd being together had me riled up. I ate lunch alone that day, being unable to find Davey.Brandon and Trevor left campus with their girlfriends and Marcie, who was now hanging off the arm of Jim McDonald, another player on the football team. Ronna and Jeannette ignored me in the cafeteria, and Todd was sitting with a bunch of friends.So far, my efforts to find out what had happened to Sean were having no results at all. Only a few of those I spoke to barely remembered him at all.It was almost like he’d disappeared off the face of the earth. P.E. got off to a bad start before I’d even changed into my workout gear.Today was a weight-training day, and I was looking forward to it a lot. Working out with weights had always been a stress reliever for me, and the state of my weight equipment in the garage at home told me that I’d gotten out of the habit of using it in the last year. “Yo, Breckenridge.” Reggie’s voice rang out in the locker room.It was a big room, but all of the football team had lockers near each other and Reggie’s was a few feet down from mine.He’d called out just as I was putting my jock strap on. “What?” I practically snarled and he grinned so that his white teeth shone like beacons in his dark face. “I hear Marcie wasn’t happy because you couldn’t satisfy her with your stump of a dick.” He teased, garnering laughs from those nearby.Brandon was sniggering along with the rest of them while Trevor limited himself to a snarky grin. “Man, you should know better than to listen to that bitch’s lies.” I snorted as my mind raced for a comeback. I was just too pissed off by now to be nice. “That cunt was so damn wide open she could fit the entire football team in there at once without feeling a damn thing.” “No shit.” Reggie said with a salacious grin while several people laughed openly at that comment. “Hell, I thought you knew that.” I continued, emboldened by the fact that people were now laughing with me and not at me. “I heard she could never learn to keep her damn legs shut.That’s why I had to dump her, you know.There’s no telling what’s been in her cunt, and I don’t want to catch some nasty disease from her skanky ass.” “Oh man, she’s not going to like that.” Brandon murmured from nearby as everyone laughed. “Who cares?” I responded back angrily as I pulled on some sweat pants.Davey was doing well, not having missed any classes this week, but he milled around as everyone filed into the weight room.Something in me snapped at that point, and I realized that my jealousy was being irrational.My Davey had explained something about himself at this age, in this timeline, and I had to remember that. It was the reason why I hadn’t tripped him into my bed already.The Davey of this timeline pushed away everyone he just had sex with, and I’d seen that when he just blew by Todd in the hallway this morning.If I wanted to not only get Davey into my bed, but keep him there forever, I had to make sure we were close friends first, and make sure that when he did find his way into my bed, that we’d talked about it beforehand, and that he’d opened his mind to being gay and accepted that a relationship between two men was possible.Right now, he believed being gay was a sickness, something to be hidden, and that it was impossible for two men to have a relationship. “You ready for some weights, buddy?” I asked as I came up to Davey and slipped my arm around his shoulder. He stiffened at the touch, but nodded hesitantly before allowing me to lead him into the weight room.What followed was probably the best part of the day, with me taking the time to show him how to correctly use the weight machines. I made sure to talk softly, so it wouldn’t be obvious that he didn’t really know what he was doing, and we spent most of the entire hour in a semi-comfortable almost-silence.We didn’t talk about anything other than our working out, but it seemed to heal the rift that had been between us earlier in the day. On my part, there was just something about being in his presence that soothed me.Even if we weren’t sharing the deepest secrets of our hearts, or for that matter even talking about the weather, at least I was in the room with him and we were interacting.Nor did I miss the way he stared at my crotch as I spotted him on the bench press. He was wearing an old, ragged pair of gray sweats that showed me enough of his reaction that I had to smile for the rest of the class period. No, neither of us was fully hard, but there was some excitement there.Fortunately, no one else was paying much attention to us as we finished our workout and headed into the locker room for showers.As we passed Coach Cole, I noticed the approving nod he gave me, and the very tight smile on his face. “Thanks.” Davey said twenty minutes later as he got out of my car.We were at my place, and he was heading for his car before I’d even turned off the ignition of the mustang. “Hey, you want to come inside?” I asked him and he shook his head. “I’ve got to run by all three restaurants and pick up my paychecks, sign them and get them to Nanny before I change and go to work at the McHenry Avenue one.” Davey said quickly.“Thanks though, I’ll see you in school, tomorrow, right?” “Yep.” I assured him and he smiled again before getting into his car.I stood there and waved as he drove off, not sure if I should have done something to keep him around longer.Damn it all, this was so damn frustrating! How had he done this, navigated the course of what to allow to happen, when to interfere, and all that crap?As unprepared as he was that first time Davey went back in time, he was better prepared in many ways than I was now. He knew the timeline he was changing, I did not. David Jones Sr. was supposed to be on track for becoming President of the United States. Instead he was a convicted child molester who couldn’t get elected as a dogcatcher at this point.Brandon and Trevor were supposed to be our best friends, and instead they frowned about the time I spent with Davey and stayed with girlfriends neither of them really cared about.As for Sean, subtle inquiries by me had not produced even a cold trail. I’d even looked in the phone book for his family and found nothing. He’d told me not to bother looking him up, but he was a friend, or at least he had been a friend in the other timeline. “Brian, honey, you okay?” Mom’s voice from the doorway reminded me I was standing on the edge of our driveway, staring at the spot where Davey’s car had been. “Sorry, just thinking.” I said as I walked up the driveway and gave her a hug.That was one good thing about this timeline; I could still hug my parents. “How was school today?” She asked as she followed me inside the house. “Frustrating.” I answered honestly and got a weird look from her. “That’s a new answer.” She said with a slight smile. “What was so frustrating?” “Just about everything.” I answered honestly, knowing it was a cryptic response and not sure how much could be shared with her without setting off alarm bells.She took that in stride though. “Would you like something to snack on?” She asked. “No thanks, I’ve got to get started on homework.” I replied. “Okay, just let me know.” She said. “I’m working with the foundation on our next fundraiser, so I’ll be in the office.” “Okay.” I replied, not sure exactly what she was talking about.This was part of my problem. As familiar as things were, I still felt like I was living in someone else’s life at times. This wasn’t the past I remembered, and I missed what I remembered.Everything was just too different! The homework was too easy, I realized about an hour later.With a sigh, I put the last of it away and changed into a pair of sweats and a white t-shirt. Maybe I could use the weight set in the garage and work off some of the tension I was feeling. Ten minutes later, as I looked at my weight set, I let out a long sigh.From what I was seeing, it hadn’t been used in at least a year. That gave me a useful task after I opened the garage door for more light and some fresh air.The first job was to get all the dust off the equipment and check to make sure everything was still in useable condition. Twenty minutes later, I was relieved that nothing was irreparably damaged.That was when the sound of a Volkswagen Beetle reached the garage, and a minute later a semi-decrepit 1970’s era lime-green Beetle pulled up in front of the house. A pair of fuzzy dice were even visible hanging from the rear view mirror, and as Todd got out, I found I was smiling. “Hi.” Todd said as he walked up the driveway. He looked a little uncomfortable, as if he wasn’t sure of the reception he’d get, but he did have a half-smile on his face. “Heya Todd.” I replied while being sure to smile. The red-haired guy returned the smile and seemed to relax just a bit.“You look pretty good compared to Davey and Ronna.” “I went home and took a nap after school.” He replied with a slightly wider smile. “So what brings you here?” I asked as I stood up from dusting off a set of fifty-pound weights. “I, uh, I was just in the area.” Todd said with a shrug and an uncomfortable look that said otherwise. “Did you enjoy your birthday?” “It was nice.” I said noncommittally. He put his hands in his jean pockets and lowered his head a bit, looking at me through his reddish bangs. “I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable last night.” He said in a breathy voice, with the words tumbling out one after the other. “I swear I don’t know what happened. All that alcohol and those stupid dares…” “Don’t sweat it.” I said with a shrug. What followed was one of those uncomfortable silences that happen from time to time. From the way Todd kept looking around, and returning to me over and over again, I knew he wanted to say something more about the previous night, but he was scared. “I, um, uh, about last night, you know, um, you won’t say anything, right?” Todd managed to stammer out and I almost laughed, but quickly suppressed the smile that was starting to form on my face. “Like I’m going to tell people I kissed you and Davey?” I said with a snort and he seemed to relax slightly. “Sorry, I was just, um, well you know.” Todd said with a shrug as he blushed. “Know what?” I asked with real curiosity. “I mean, I’m not going to end up stuffed in a garbage can or anything, right?” Todd said in a rush. “When was the last time I’ve done that?” I asked rhetorically, but an old memory surfaced, and I could feel the blood draining from my face. “Well, do you remember Sean in freshman year?” Todd said with a little bit of fire appearing in his voice.It disappeared quickly as he looked at me with a little bit of fear and I started to feel ashamed. I wasn’t the Brian that had done that.In my own time, someone like Todd would never have been afraid of me, but this wasn’t my timeline was it? Still, the mention of Sean, and the hint of familiarity in his voice gave me a bit of hope. “I remember him.” I said with a frown, pulling up that memory of a conversation between Sean and Davey that we had witnessed. I hadn’t thought about it for decades, but it was crystal clear in my mind’s eye now. “He…” “You guys were kind of mean to him.” Todd finished when I paused.He looked at me sideways, as if afraid of my reaction. “Yeah, we were and he didn’t deserve it at all.” I said softly and could see the surprise on Todd’s face.“I haven’t seen him around in ages.” “He… his folks moved.” Todd said quickly, covering up at least a bit of Sean’s story, which he obviously knew. “I almost wish I could see him again to apologize.” I said, casting out a line and hoping he’d bite. “Why?” Todd asked and I smiled at him, hoping to reassure him. “He didn’t deserve what we did to him.” I said softly.“I’m sure given half a chance he’d make a good friend.” “I’ve known him since sixth grade.” Todd said softly.“We’re actually related distantly. His father’s cousin married one of my mom’s cousin or something like that.I heard he was somewhere in Southern California.” “Really?” I said with surprise. “Does he ever come back to town?” “Once in a while.” Todd said with a shrug. “You know, it’d be nice to say ‘sorry’ to him.” I said and Todd gave me an odd look. “I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but you’ve like changed a lot since school let out last winter.” Todd said in a rush again. “Yeah, I grew up, I guess.” I said with a shrug. It had the virtue of being true, in a way. “Wow.” Todd said softly. “I guess people can change.Don’t get me wrong, you’ve always seemed like you could be a nice guy, but you never gave yourself a chance, you know.” “Yeah, that sounds about right.” I agreed and his eyes widened a bit.My smile seemed to reassure him though. “So, Davey got his car?” He said to change the subject before it got more uncomfortable. “Yeah, he had to leave in a hurry though.” I said with regret, which he seemed to hear in my voice. “He’s a lot different than he was when I knew him before.” Todd said and I raised an eyebrow as an unspoken question. “I met him in eighth grade.We had the same math class, old crazy Mrs. Dent.Freshman year we still talked because we had the same math class, but he was busy hanging around the football team after school so we didn’t get together as much. Then he just flat disappeared.I heard from somewhere that he’d moved to Nevada.” “Yeah.” I said after he’d fallen silent. “You know about his dad?” Todd asked and I nodded. “Fucking sick.” “Yeah.” I agreed softly. “So he came back here after that.” “He doesn’t talk about it much.” Todd said. “Ronna’s gotten some of the story from him, but when the subject comes up, he clams up tight.” “She’s known him a long time?” I asked and Todd nodded. “They’ve known each other since the fourth grade.” Todd explained.“I guess you could say she’s known him longer than anyone else except his family. Last night, she wanted to ask him out, but he shot her down.She’s kind of mad at him.” “I can see that.” I said, hoping he’d share what he knew. “He told her that when they first moved back, he didn’t know what was going on with his dad.” Todd said sadly.“His mom just told him they were coming back to California for Thanksgiving.He missed most of that semester and had to make up work the next year at Ceres High. Ronna said he begged for a transfer to Downey and his mom worked it out somehow. Ronna thought he wanted it to try to find her again. She’s got this notion that she and Davey are meant to be together.” “Not fucking likely.” I snorted and he actually chuckled for a moment before giving me an appraising look. “You and I probably have a better chance at that.” He said very softly, barely above a whisper and this time I gave him a deep, searching look.Did he want my Davey? “Well he is a good kisser.” I said softly and Todd frowned. “Better than me?” Todd asked as if he was offended and we both burst out in laughter. “Do you really want an answer to that?” I asked him when we’d calmed down. “No, not really.” Todd said quietly, looking nervous again.“Does that freak you out?” “What, kissing guys?” I asked and he nodded. “Not really.” “Oh.” Todd said with a look of surprise. “Does that mean…are you?” “Am I what?” I asked him and he shuffled his feet nervously while hanging his head and looking at me through his red bangs. “Um…you know.” He said softly after I remained silent. “I guess you could describe me as being bi.” I said softly, knowing that twenty years from now such an admission might not have been as big a deal as it was in the here and now. Todd’s head jerked up and he looked at me with surprise as his mouth formed a small “O”. “Is that why you broke up with Marcie?” He asked. “Let’s just say I realized she wasn’t what I was looking for in life.” I answered his question with a shrug. “Rad.” He said softly. “I never thought someone like you would ever admit to liking guys like…” “Like?” I asked him and he hung his head again. “I don’t like girls.” He said very softly with blushing cheeks. “Nothing wrong with that.” I said casually and his head jerked again. This was almost fun. “I’ve never talked with anyone…” Todd said softly before swallowing nervously. “Most guys our age wouldn’t want to talk about it at all.” I said and he nodded. “Davey freaks if I even hint about stuff like this.” Todd said and I felt a surge of jealousy.He had done it with Davey! “Really?” I managed in a voice that barely shook at all.At the moment, I was very proud of that fact.Knowing Davey didn’t have the same…values that I did in this timeline was one thing, but being confronted with it was an entirely different animal. “Not that we’ve ever done anything.” Todd said quickly, noting something in the glare I was giving him without thinking about what I was doing.“Whenever he sleeps over, I’ve got an extra twin bed in my room. It use to be my brother’s before he went off to college. Still, I’ve seen the way he looks at me sometimes at night, and well, I’ve seen the way he’s looked at you this last week at school.” “The way he looks at me?” I asked with surprise, and a sudden warm feeling filled my heart.He was looking at me! “I don’t mean to upset you.” Todd said softly, mistaking the flushing of my cheeks. “I’m not upset.” I said quickly. “You like him, don’t you?” Todd asked. “Yes.” I answered simply and he smiled. “That’s like, so cool.” Todd said. “I can’t believe we’re standing here discussing it like this.I never thought…” “Life’s full of surprises.” I said with a dismissive shrug. “Dude, you know he’s pretty messed up right now, don’t you?” Todd asked.“He works a lot, and his home life ain’t too good either.Like I said, he don’t talk about it much, but we’ve figured out some of it between us.Sometimes he fights with his grandfather and shows up at my place late at night when my parents aren’t home – they go a lot during the week on business, and so he sneaks in and spends the night after he fights with his grandfather. The old man locks him out if he isn’t home by eleven, and sometimes Davey works until late at night.” “That sucks.” I said simply, not sure why Pete would do such a thing.In my timeline, him and Davey had been tight as thieves.Thanks to Sean’s medical equipment, the old man hadn’t suffered the ravages of Alzheimer’s like he had in other timelines, according to Davey. Every year they took an annual fishing trip to a lake somewhere nearby, all the way up until the old man had died in 2017, just a month after his hundredth birthday. Davey had taken him, just the two of them, fishing on Pete’s birthday, which was a week before Davey’s own birthday. This timeline sucks; I reminded myself, amazed yet again how Davey had persevered through all this and became the man I loved. “It does suck.” Todd agreed softly with my last verbal statement.“You know, Davey’s a good guy.A really good guy. He’d give the shirt off his back if you needed it, but he doesn’t like to take help, and he never asks for it either.I had to beg him to come over if he gets locked out.Jeannette caught him sleeping in his car one night and got him to admit he couldn’t go home because he was locked out.He got pissed as hell that she told Ronna, and he was pissed that Ronna told me. Their parents don’t like him much, mostly ‘cause of his father.” “It was good of you to make sure he knew he could stay with you.” I said softly and Todd smiled in appreciation of the compliment. “Yeah, well, nights when my parents get home, he can’t stay and I know he sleeps in his car then.” Todd said with a frown. “I wish I could help him more, but he wouldn’t take it if I offered.My parents, well if they knew, they wouldn’t let him stay over during the week.” “He can always stay here, you know.” I said firmly. “What about your parents?” Todd asked. “They seem to like him, and they won’t turn him away.” I said.“Although they might have some sharp words with his grandfather.” “Then he’d never risk them finding out again.” Todd shook his head. “Just… if he can’t stay at your place and is locked out, tell him to come here.” I told Todd. “I’ll make sure my parents don’t do anything to scare him off.” “You sure?” Todd asked as his watch alarm started beeping.“Shit.I have to be at work in twenty minutes.” “I’m sure, don’t worry.” I said and stood up to hold out my hand.He looked at it and smiled before shaking it. “See ya tomorrow.” He said brightly before turning and rushing to his beetle before taking off. “Who was that?” Mom asked as I stood there thinking about Davey and his problems. “A new friend.” I answered her after a pause. “Really?” Mom sounded surprised. “I don’t think you’ve made a new friend in years.” “He was here last night.” I reminded her. “His name’s Todd.” “Oh that’s right, the boy with red hair.” She said. “Are you hungry?” “I could use a snack.” I agreed, reminded yet again that my teenage body needed more food than I was use to consuming as an old man. “Is everything going alright, Brian?” Mom asked as she put down a plate of sliced cheese and fruit on the kitchen table. She also had two glasses of water, and sat down across from me as I picked up a piece of cheese. The boys had shared my love of cheese, to Davey’s horror.Even after three lifetimes, he still couldn’t stand to eat any yellow cheese like this. “Things are okay, why?” I asked with a slight frown after swallowing the sharp cheddar cheese. “Well, it’s just…you’ve been a little different lately.” Mom said softly.“Don’t get me wrong, your father and I are really happy with some of the changes, especially after that night, but we’re also a little worried.” “What are you worried about?” I asked while furrowing my eyebrows.How had Davey managed to make it through situations like this?It was so different after being an adult to have to answer to my parents again. Sure, even after Davey and I had gone off to Stanford, they’d still been my parents, but as time went by we became adult friends as well as parents and child. Now I was back to being their child again, although bordering on adulthood.To make it even more interesting I could remember what it had been like to be a parent of two seventeen-year old boys and all the heartache they put Davey and I through with their schooling, their girlfriends, and their interesting group of friends. Certainly the media had a field day with them a time or two, but at least Davey’s father had already left the Oval Office by that point so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. “I haven’t seen Trevor or Brandon over here in a while except for your birthday.” Mom said with a slight frown on her face. “The three of you have been all but inseparable since junior high.What’s going on?” “We’re having a difference of opinion.” I said sourly. “About what?” Mom asked as she nibbled on a piece of melon. “It’s over my breaking up with Marcie.” I told her and she chewed for a moment before replying. “High school can be a difficult time, Brian.” Mom said in a nice tone.“We often think we’re in love with someone and we find out we’re not. At least you broke up with her before things got too serious, right?” “Yeah.” I answered the unspoken question as well as the one that she voiced, and prayed I was right. The last thing on earth that I needed was for the ‘me’ of this timeline to have gotten that fucking bitch pregnant. “So what’s the problem with Trevor and Brandon?” Mom asked. “They don’t really understand why I don’t want to get back together with Marcie, and their girlfriends were giving them a bad time about pushing me to get back together with her.” I said in a rush and Mom shook her head. “So they’re being torn between their friendship with you and their girlfriends?” Mom asked, but in a tone that made the question rhetorical. “Kids these days.” I said with a chuckle, and worried I might have slipped a little, but she laughed and smiled at the statement. “I wouldn’t worry too much about them, Brian.” Mom assured me.“Give it some time to calm down and they’ll remember the years of friendship they’ve had with you.” “That’s what I’m thinking.” I agreed. “You know, sometimes I forget that you really are almost grown now.” She said with a fond smile that I remembered all too dearly. I’d missed her since she died, a great-grandmother as well as a grandmother and a mother. The last Christmas she’d been alive, we’d had six little kids running around the house, as well as our own two sons and their wives. “Yeah, life goes by too fast sometimes.” I agreed with her, lost in the memory of a timeline gone forever now. “Well, I’ve got homework to do, thanks for the snack.” “You’re welcome.” Mom said as I stood up and went to my room.The homework didn’t take all that long, and when I was finished, I began rummaging through the top drawers of my desk in what was becoming a regular routine. This life was similar to my original teenage years, but there was just enough difference to it that I was trying to piece together the clues of what those differences were. Stuck in the back of one of the drawers was my bank book.Dad had started it for me in my original childhood just after I’d turned thirteen, when I started getting a regular allowance of more than a few dollars. Apparently in this timeline, it had been started after Uncle Rich had died, and it looked like my parents had given me a fairly substantial allowance as well as regular payments that looked like they’d come from rent income based on the leasing out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. That hurt a bit, as I remembered my uncle who had died two years after mom, a very old man. For him to be cut down in the prime of his life by an AIDS epidemic that was much worse than anything I remembered and made me sad. It also gave me an appreciation for how much better Davey had made my world before we’d even met. Another thing I learned was that at least my father insisted that most of the money be invested into stocks. That was good because it had kept the other me from raiding the bank account for what I thought of as the “Marcie” depredations. At least he’d kept good records of all the money he’d spent on her.A diamond necklace?Diamond earrings and five hundred dollar watch?Nearly a hundred dollars every week for lunch?That might not have been a lot in 2050, but in 1986 that was a fortune! No, it was a good thing the bitch was gone from my life.The bank account was a lot leaner than it should be, but it was more than enough for my regular needs, and what was put back in stocks and other savings would be more than enough to see me through college.At least the money-pit hadn’t robbed me of a comfortable future. “Brian, it’s almost time for dinner!” Mom called out from the kitchen and I sighed before putting the bank documents back in my drawer.Things weren’t perfect, but they were a lot better than they could have been, I decided as I went to help set the table. Now, all I had to do was to secure a lasting friendship with my beloved. Chapter 6 “Are you sure about this, Brian?” Dad asked me as he looked over the paper given to me by the guidance counselor. “You’re a little more than halfway through the school year.” “It’s going to take a lot of work, but I can do it.” I assured my father who was looking at a form to approve several changes in my schedule. Two of my teachers had encouraged me to speak to my guidance counselor after the first tests towards the end of January. The conversation with the guidance counselor had been enlightening in more ways than one. I don’t think kids ever realized just how much some of the staff at school knew about what was going on, even in a school as large as Downey. Then again, I’d been fairly noticeable as a student, even in this timeline.My guidance counselor had heard that Marcie had gotten me to pick easier classes this year so I’d share more classes with her. After a discussion with several teachers, and an oral exam by two of them, I was approved for changing to college-prep courses in three subjects.It meant a lot of make-up work for me, but it would be worth it, and not only because I added another class to the number I shared with Davey, but because I would now have no classes with Marcie who was still being an absolute bitch. “What about baseball?” Dad said with a frown. “Can you do the extra work and still make practice as well as the games?” “Yes.” I said confidently and he looked at me for a long moment before signing the form.It was Friday night, and all I had to do was turn in the form on Monday morning and I’d be in my new classes.Baseball tryouts had been harder than I had expected, but then I hadn’t played baseball or softball in nearly twenty years. Still, I’d made the team, if only by the skin of my teeth. “Here you go.” Dad said with a smile as he handed the form back to me.We were sitting in the dining room where we’d just finished a round of Monopoly and Mom was now putting the game away.We’d all talked about the schedule change I wanted, and my mother had left us to finish the discussion.“If you run into problems, I expect you to talk with me about them.” “I will.” I assured him and he looked at me for a minute before nodding. “I actually believe you will now.” Dad said with a smile forming on his face.“You’ve finally got your head on straight, it seems.” “I’m trying.” I assured him. “I won’t say the obvious, but I’m glad that what happened earlier this month seems to have gotten you turned around.” Dad said. “I’ll be honest and say I was beginning to get worried about you.It wasn’t just the drinking and staying out all night, it was things like how much you were spending on her. A relationship should be about more than that, and I had thought you’d learned that from our talks.” “I don’t know what came over me.” I said with a shake of my head.“I only wish I’d realized what a leech she was earlier.” “You know it now, before it was too late.” Dad said in a comforting tone as Mom came back and sat down at the table. She had just gotten a perm today and her blond hair was practically bouncing in one of those typical hair-spray laden late-80’s hair styles.“Brian, there is something we should all talk about as a family.” “Okay.” I said softly, wondering what was going on and what it would all mean.This timeline was so different I couldn’t depend on any memories of it to guide me. “I know you’re as uncomfortable talking about your Uncle Rich as you are about your grandparents, but this sort of has to do with both of them.” Dad said and I narrowed my eyes while listening to him. The reference to Uncle Rich was obvious, and while it hurt that he’d died when he should have lived, it wasn’t something likely to set me off.What did my grandparents have to do with this? “Honey, you really shouldn’t blame yourself for their deaths.” Mom said softly, reaching out across the table towards me. I put my hand in hers and prepared to receive some bad news.My grandparents, at least on my father’s side, should be alive still, but it sounded like something had changed and they’d died.That brought tears to my eyes, but I’d already dealt with the grief over losing my kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids, but it was more for those I’d left behind in the other timeline than for news of my grandparents’ death. “Just because you wanted to spend Thanksgiving last year with Marcie’s parents doesn’t make you responsible for their dying in that crash.They chose to come out here, and it’s not your fault they died in the accident on the way down from Sacramento’s airport.No one could have known the fog would have been that bad, and they should have stopped in a hotel room instead of driving in it when it got real thick. They knew they weren’t use to driving in fog.” “It’s alright, Mom.” I said with a shaky breath and bit back a curse to be directed at Marcie and my other self from this timeline. It really wasn’t their fault, anymore than it was mine.There was no way I could have known this would happen when I reset the timelines and I certainly hadn’t caused it by going back in time. The news was sad news, but it wasn’t something I would blame myself for causing. “As you know, they left us quite a bit of money in their will.” Dad continued in a soft voice. They had been his parents after all, and part of me was amazed that there were no recriminations in his eyes. I was proud of him, the way he didn’t blame me even though he could have, and he could have allowed it to create a rift between us. This also explained some of the self-destructive behavior the other me had engaged in recently. “A few friends of your Uncle Rich have stayed in touch with your mother and I over the years, and they are starting up a new company in the Bay Area.They’ve offered to bring me in as a partner and CFO, that’s Chief Financial Officer.” “I know what a CFO is, Dad.” I said with a hint of sarcasm and he smiled gently. “It’s a good offer, and I think they have a good business model set-up.” Dad continued his explanation. “My experience in banking and the financial markets will be helpful.” “What kind of business is it?” I asked with some real interest.This was not something I remembered from the previous timeline. “It’s a marketing and public relations firm.” Dad explained.“Several of the partners have worked for other agencies and they want to form a new business together, focusing on the emerging businesses in Silicon Valley.” “Why are they approaching you?” I asked with a frown. “Your Uncle is one of the reasons.” Dad said softly with a look at Mom who smiled back at him in what was an encouraging way. “He helped a couple of them get their careers started before he got sick.Another is that I have enough venture capital to help them get off the ground, plus my financial degrees as well as my experience will help them with the banks and other lending institutions that they need for the rest of their venture capital.” “So you’re going to ask if I’m willing to move out there?” I asked, taking the information and moving to the next step. Mom’s hand tightened on mine for a moment while Dad smiled. “Actually it was to present you with a couple of options and to see if you think I should take the risk.” Dad said. “Don’t get me wrong, it is a risk.The business could fail and we could go broke over it, or it could succeed.Either way it’s going to mean a lot of work.It might be easier if we all moved to the Bay Area, but the fact is that you’ve lived all your life here and both your mother and I are loath to give up this house.” “I’d prefer not to move, even though it means a lot of commuting by you.” I said with some sympathy for my father. Sure, over the next twenty years many people would choose to live in this area and commute two hours each way to the Bay Area for work, but it was still hard. “I’ll only be working up there for two or three days a week to start with.” Dad said.“The rest of the work will be stuff I can do here from home. If it gets too bad, I’ll probably stay overnight there during the week and come back home on the weekends, but either way it does mean we’ll have to depend on you more to help your mother out around the house.” “That won’t be a problem.” I assured him and he nodded. “So you’re okay with this?” Mom asked. “I say we go for it.” I told both of them. “It’s a real opportunity.” “That it is, son.” Dad said as the phone rang and Mom got up to answer it. “It looks like from your new classes that you plan on going to college after all.” “I’d like to, yes.” I agreed and he nodded. “We’ll put enough money in a college savings account from my parent’s settlement so that you won’t have to worry about paying for college even if things go sour.” Dad assured me as Mom reentered the kitchen. “Brian, it’s Davey on the phone for you.” She said quietly and I looked over at the clock to see it was just after ten-thirty. It was a Friday night, and I was no longer grounded so it wasn’t past curfew, but it was a little late for a social call.Davey and I had gone to lunch together a few times since the day after my birthday, and he’d been at school every day, not missing any more classes, but with the start of baseball practice and his work, we hadn’t gotten together much after school. It was slightly frustrating, but I was determined to take this slow, and so far that had been working fairly well.We’d had a few good conversations when we’d gone to lunch and he had opened up a bit about his current situation at home, although most of it was about his mother’s upcoming surgery. “Thanks Mom.” I said as I got up from the table and headed to the phone in the kitchen, which was the one she’d used to pick up the call.“Davey?” “Hi.” Davey’s voice sounded stressed. Sure, he wasn’t the exact same Davey I’d known for decades, but he was close enough that I knew when he was stressed from the sound of his voice alone.“I’m sorry to call so late.” “It’s okay.” I told him quickly. “I was just talking with my parents.” “Oh, I um, sorry to interrupt.” He said nervously. “It’s just that… well I tried to call Todd but his parents are home and…” “What’s up?” I asked firmly. “I’m at work.” He said and the sounds in the background from his end suddenly made a lot of sense.“I just got off shift early and my car won’t start.I tried calling home but the line’s been busy and my grandparents don’t believe in call waiting and it’s probably my cousin or my sister, either of which means they’ll be on the phone until everyone goes to bed and like I said Todd is stuck with his parents so…” “You called me.” I finished for him and chuckled. “Dude, I’m glad you called. You want me to come pick you up?I can give you a ride home and then tomorrow we’ll go look at your car.Do you know what’s wrong with it?” “I think it’s the starter, but I’m not sure.” Davey said softly.“I’m really sorry to bug you about this, but…” “Dude, you’re a friend.” I assured him calmly. “Friends help each other out. Am I right that if it was me calling you, you’d help me out?” “Yeah, it’s just I don’t like needing the help.” Davey said sourly. “Look at from my perspective.” I encouraged him. “At least I’m getting to prove I mean it when I say we’re friends.” “You don’t need to prove that.” Davey said and I felt a blush fill my cheeks. “So where you at?” I asked him. “The McD’s on McHenry.” He said quickly. “Ouch, all the cruisers giving you a bad time?” I asked him with a chuckle and he made a non-committal noise.“Okay, I’ll be there in about twenty minutes.” “That long?” He asked with a hint of despair in his voice and then realized it might have sounded bad because he spoke up quickly. “Sorry, don’t mean it like that. It’s just my grandparents are really strict about locking the house up at eleven-thirty. If’ I’m not there by then I’ll have to find somewhere else to sleep.” “Then why don’t we not bother?” I asked quickly, although I was having mixed feelings about the offer I was about to make. “I’ll ask my parents if you can spend the night.Then we can get an earlier start with getting back to your car.” “Are you sure?” He asked with a bit of hope in his voice and I smiled even though he couldn’t see that smile. “Absolutely.” I assured him. “Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.” He said with a little more happiness in his voice.The only reason I’d been of a split mind about having him over was that I knew if I was to make it work with him I couldn’t give in to my desire for a physical relationship right now.We had to have a firm friendship first and then the sex could happen. Sure, as an old man it had been a while since I’d had sex with the Davey of the other timeline, and he wasn’t in as good physical shape as I was accustomed to seeing on my Davey, but he was still Davey and I wanted him.Could I control myself? “Mom, Dad, Davey’s car won’t start and he’s at work right now, needing a way home.” I told my parents as I reentered the dining room. “I don’t think we’ll worry about you being a little past curfew if you’re helping a friend out.” My father said with a smile and his eyes flashed approval.“It’s a good thing he felt like he could call you for help.” “I was wondering if you’d mind him spending the night?” I asked them and Mom looked at me with a frown. “Not that we would object to you having a friend over.” Mom began softly.“Lord knows you use to have Brandon or Trevor over all the time, but why now and with such short notice?” “Two reasons on that one.” I began cautiously. “First off, I told him I’d help him see what was wrong with his car, and in order to do that I’ll have to pick him up and drive him back there in the morning. It’ll be quicker if we’re both here in the morning instead of having to drive to Ceres to pick him up.” “Ceres?” Dad asked in surprise. “Why does he have to go to Ceres?” “It’s where he’s living.” I answered. “I thought he was living with his grandparents.” Mom stated. “He does, that’s where they live, in Ceres.” I explained. “Then how does he go to Downey?” Dad asked. “Shouldn’t he be going to Ceres High?” “He went there when he first moved back from Nevada.” I said carefully. I didn’t want to lie to them, but I didn’t know exactly what they might do if they knew the full truth. “He transferred to Downey last September.” “I didn’t know they’d let you do that.” Mom said. “Well, we better not keep you.” “What was your other reason for wanting him to stay the night?” Dad asked before I could make it out of the dining room. I turned back to look at him with a frown. “If he’s not home by eleven-thirty his grandfather won’t let him in the house.” I answered and Dad frowned deeply. “Brian, honey, you want me to make up a place for him on the sofa or do you mind sharing your bed?” Mom asked in a fierce tone. “I’ve been thinking that I really should clean up the mess in the guest bedroom since I’ve been doing so much with the charity that I don’t sew quite as much.If I cleaned it up, we could have that twin bed in there for your guests.” “I don’t mind sharing.” I assured her and she nodded. “You have clean sheets on your bed?” She asked me sternly. “I just put them on yesterday.” My answer met her approval. “Get going then.” She told me curtly and I smiled at my parents and their soft-hearted nature as I rushed to my bathroom. I’d been wearing a pair of jogging short and a white t-shirt for most of the evening since dinner finished and so I quickly pulled on a pair of tight 501’s and peach and white striped polo before grabbing my car keys and heading towards the front door. I could hear my parents talking about plans for cleaning up the guest bedroom and I smiled to myself at their transparency. For whatever reason, they liked and felt sorry for the Davey of this timeline, and they were planning on reaching out to him. “I’m going now!” I called out to them. “Hold on a minute.” Dad called out and I waited near the front door for him to come out of the dining room. He held out his hand stuffed with a wad of money and pressed it into mine.“Take him out for a soda or something.Just be quiet when you get back, okay?” “Thanks.” I replied and he nodded before patting me on the shoulder and walking towards the living room where Mom was turning on the television.I had tears in my eyes as I got into my car and started it up.My parents really were good people. I knew that cruising was a tradition all across the nation, but in Modesto it held a special significance as a teen ritual.During the mid-nineties, local governments began cracking down on the decades-old tradition, pretty much outlawing it in cities all across the nation.In Modesto of the mid-eighties though, the tradition immortalized in George Lucas’s American Graffiti still held strong.While the movie had been filmed elsewhere, it had been based on the filmmaker’s experiences cruising up and down McHenry Avenue in Modesto. Every year, the town celebrated the movie with a weekend celebration in June that had lasted all the way up until the year I came back in time. That meant going anywhere on McHenry, a main North/South street in central Modesto would take forever.Fortunately there were a lot of side streets that could be used to get to the McDonald’s that Davey was at, and I was there in just a little over twenty minutes. He was sitting on the hood of his Pontiac J2000 and a frown filled my face at the sight of him smoking a cigarette.Sure, he’d told me once that he’d smoked in his first timeline, and that he’d started at seventeen, but he’d also quit after his first trip back in time. As I pulled up next to him, he threw the butt on the ground and hopped off the hood.He didn’t need a lecture from me about smoking, and for now I decided to ignore that aspect of him in the here and now.There would be plenty of time to get him to quit.With the family history of cancer that he had, he didn’t need to be puffing on those things. “Hey.” He called as I reached over and unlocked the door for him.Davey got in, along with a stench of smoke and hamburger grease and threw his bag into the back seat. At least he still had the habit of fastening his seat belt as soon as he got in a car. “Sorry it took me so long.” I said instead of complaining about the cigarette smell. “No problem, I got in touch with my mother.” He said with a frown.“My damn cousin was on the phone all night talking to some loser she’s dating. She’s pissed because she wanted to go out with him but Nanny insisted she look after the baby for once.Of course as soon as it’s bedtime, Nanny will be taking the baby into her bed.Mom says it’s fine for me to stay over, but she’s worried about the car and what it’ll cost.” “Let’s worry about that tomorrow.” I said with a smile as I pulled out.“You want to stop for a bite to eat or a soda?Dad gave me some money…” “Dressed like this?” He asked as he plucked at his polyester Mickey D uniform.“Besides I stink.” “You can say that again.” I muttered, and looked askance until he started laughing. “I’d actually prefer to get a shower, if you don’t mind.” He said shyly and I nodded, pulling into the heavy cruising traffic. Right away, I realized things could be worse when I looked over at the car next to me and saw Marcie glaring at me. Well, she was really glaring at me and at Davey in the seat next to me.Davey was rambling on about what a bad day he’d had at work and how his car breaking down was just the icing on the cake, and about his worries regarding how he was going to afford a new starter while all I could do was return Marcie’s glare as traffic inched forward.She blinked first but turned around with one last spiteful glance, and her head disappeared from view.Considering she was in the car with Mark Richards, a guy from the baseball team, and the look of first surprise and then lust that crossed his face told me what she was doing. I didn’t need to see a bit of hair bob into view for a moment, or the look of fear on his face as he looked over to see me watching to know what was going on over there. I just shook my head and turned to talk to Davey, actually feeling sorry for Mark being used by the bitch. Maybe I should warn him? When we got back to the house, Mom and Dad were sitting on the couch, watching the evening news.The news show was profiling Christa McAuliffe, and I felt guilty for a moment, but there was nothing I could do about her or the Challenger at this point. I clearly remembered that being one of the things Davey had stopped from happening, and I even remembered him telling me about it being next Tuesday, but who would believe me at this point? “You boys are back early.” Mom said as we entered the living room. “Davey wanted a shower more than anything else.” I said with a smile.“Frankly, I think that was a good idea.” “Brian!” Mom chided me although she was laughing as Davey mock-punched me in the arm. “Be nice, son.” Dad said but he was smiling too. “Here, let me get you all set for a shower.” Mom said as she got up from the couch and headed off to show Davey where the towels and other stuff were located. “Here’s the money back.” I said pulling the two twenties out of my pocket and handing them back to Dad, but he waved them off. “Take him out to lunch tomorrow, or help him get his car fixed.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You sure?” I asked him and he nodded. “That kid needs a few lucky breaks in his life.” Dad said softly. “He’s my age, you know.” I reminded Dad who smiled. “Actually he’s a week older than you.” Dad reminded me. “Brian, I gave him a pair of your sweatpants and an old shirt of yours.” Mom said as she returned to the living room with Davey’s bag in her hands.“His stuff needs to be washed and he says he has work tomorrow night so he’ll need his uniform washed.I’m going to start them now.” “Thanks Mom.” I said and she nodded before heading out towards the garage with the dirty clothes. I sat down on the couch with Dad and watched the beginning of the late-night talk shows.I’d forgotten how funny Johnny Carson was in his monologue. Would he feel bad about his ‘Teacher in Space’ jokes after the Challenger exploded? “I feel much better.” Davey said as he came out of the bathroom twenty minutes later, wearing an old pair of gray sweatpants and a blue t-shirt that was a bit tight on him. He really could stand to lose about twenty pounds, and his longish hair needed a good trim, but he was still a handsome man. “Glad to hear that.” Dad said in a show of genuine affection.“If you boys want to watch television a bit, I think Brian’s mom and I are about to head to bed. Don’t stay up all night, and try to keep it quiet.” “We will.” I assured him, standing to give him a hug before he left.When Mom passed through the kitchen, she got another hug from me, and I was surprised when she hugged Davey as well. From his look, he was just as surprised. “There’s a plate of snacks on the kitchen table if you boys want some before you go to bed.” She said with a smile before heading off into the bedroom. “Hungry?” I asked Davey and he nodded shyly before following me into the kitchen.He frowned at the plate of cheese, but set right into the bowl of grapes. I got both of us glasses of milk before nibbling on the cheese. “I really appreciate this.” Davey said after a moment of silence. “I’m happy you called me.” I said honestly. “I thought Marcie was going to shoot death beams out of her eyes when she saw us.” Davey said with a little giggle and I joined him by chuckling softly. “You saw her then?” I asked. “How could I miss it when she went down on Mark?” Davey said with a leer. “God I’m glad I broke up with that slut.” I muttered and Davey laughed. “Most guys would have been happy to have a slut for a girlfriend.” Davey chortled. “I’m not.” I admitted honestly and he raised an eyebrow.Maybe this was a good time to lay some groundwork. “Why’s that?” Davey asked with real curiosity in his voice before he started blushing and looked down at the bowl of grapes. “Sorry, maybe that was a little too personal.I have this bad habit of just asking what’s on my mind.It always made my dad crazy.” “That’s okay; I can always refuse to answer a question.” I said and winked at him when he looked up at me. His shoulders had hunched up while he’d spoken, but now he relaxed a bit more and so did I.Whenever his shoulders hunched up like that, I got worried for him, and it was good to see him be more relaxed and natural.“I remember when my dad first gave me the birds and bees talk. He told me that no matter who I dated, sex should always be something special, a symbol of our commitment to each other, a lifelong commitment and not just something of the moment. Sex should be something special, shared only with the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess with Marcie, you could say I forgot that and I shouldn’t have because he was right, you know.” “Wow, all my dad told me was to never bring a nigger, spic, or gook chic home.” Davey snorted and I shook my head in disgust. President Jones would never have told his son that, but I guess the David Jones Sr. of this timeline had, and once again I missed the time I had grown up in, with the world Davey had created. “Ouch.” I said aloud and Davey nodded. “I thought he was a preacher.” “I thought he was too.” Davey said so sourly that I winced inwardly. “Davey, I hope you know that my folks and I, we don’t judge you by what your father has or has not done.” I said softly and Davey shook his head. “You’d be about the only people in the fucking county that haven’t.” He muttered with more bitterness than I could ever remember hearing from Davey before in any lifetime. “Sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you. You’ve been really cool.Why is that anyway?Is it because you feel sorry for me?” “I do feel sorry for you, yes.” I admitted and he frowned fiercely.“That’s not why I want to be your friend though.You’re a good guy, I can tell that, and you’ve been dealt a pretty fucking shitty hand by life, but none of that’s your fault.Despite all the shit you’ve been put through, you’re still a good guy. You care about your sister and your mother, and since we’ve been getting to know each other, you’ve shown you have a wicked sense of humor and make some pretty funny comments. I like that about you, and you’ve been helping me study some and that’s helped me out, and my other friends have all but abandoned me since I broke up with Marcie, but you could care less about that.” “Actually I don’t think I’d hang around you if you were still with her.” Davey said, surprising me with that comment. “That bitch – sorry but she is – she’s bad news and I don’t want to have anything to do with her or those bitches she hangs with.” “Why not?” I asked and he shrugged while plopping a grape into his mouth and chewing silently for a moment. “It’s nothing I can put my finger on, but just a feeling I get.” He answered.“It’s something to do with the way she looks at people.She looks at them like she’s measuring up what they can do for her, or give her and that’s all she cares about.Someone like that, it’s best to steer away from.” “I wish you’d been there to warn me off when I first started dating her.” I said in all honestly and he chuckled. “Sorry, I was stuck at Ceres Fucking High.” He said sourly.“Now that was a real pit-hole, let me tell you.” “At least you’re out of there now.” I reminded him and he laughed softly before stopping and looking towards the hallway leading to my parents’ room with a worried frown. “Don’t worry, the worst they’ll do is tell us to shut up and get to bed.” I assured him and he relaxed before getting a look of curiosity on his face. “Where am I going to sleep tonight?” Davey asked. “Your mom mentioned something about it being next week before they would have the guest room cleaned up.” “You can sleep in my bed, if you don’t mind.” I said with a shrug that I hoped appeared to be casual while there were butterflies in my stomach.My old mind and young body were going to war with each other all night and I’d probably not sleep at all, but at the same time it was a sweet agony that I longed for, to have him next to me again, if only for a night. “That’s fine, if you don’t mind.” He agreed and I nodded, breathing slowly so as to not look like I was sighing in relief. “I don’t.” I assured him. “What time do you want to get up in the morning?” “It should be as early as possible.” Davey said. “I really do appreciate all your help you know.I’ve got to work tomorrow night so if I can get the car fixed easily we should do it in the morning. Then I can go home and get yelled at for a bit before going to work.” “Why would they yell at you?” I asked with concern. “Oh it’s just my grandfather.” Davey said with a shake of his head.I found that the strangest of all the differences.Pete and Davey had gotten along like two peas in a pod before. What had changed so drastically. “He’s still pissed that I went over to see my dad a few times after he came back to California. That’s when he started locking me out if I got home after eleven-thirty.Every time I get home late, he thinks I’m out seeing my dad or something.” “P… Your grandfather doesn’t like your father, I take it?” I asked, almost slipping and calling his grandfather by his first name. “Yeah, Papa’s never really liked Dad and this whole mess proves that he’s always been right about Dad.” Davey said with a frown and a heavy sigh.“It doesn’t matter to him that the only reason I went over there was to confront Dad and make him admit what he did to my sister, and I actually hit him!I fucking punched him in the gut, made him double over and every thing, but no, none of that matters to Papa. Now he thinks I’m taking Dad’s side in everything every time he or Nanny start bitching about Dad. I mean, sure Dad fucked up big time and he’s really messed up all our lives, but they don’t have to fucking put him down with every damn other word out of their mouths!” “No, they don’t.” I agreed with him, hoping my parents wouldn’t react badly to the rising voice. I could hear some shuffling from the hallway, but fortunately Davey was too far gone into his grief and anger to notice.He raised his light blue eyes, tears filling them, and a long moment of silence passed between us as he searched my eyes and face for any hint of sarcasm or derision, or any other negative reaction. “I do love him still, you know.” Davey said in a voice that shook, and a part of me knew that he’d never shared this with anyone else yet, and a deep sense of honor filled me. Once, just once, my Davey had shared part of this with me, but it had been a hundred years of his lifetime since these events had happened, and the grief had been old.Here, now, it was fresh, and the wounds were still bleeding in his heart. “He’s your father.” I said softly and Davey’s eyes were latched onto mine.“Of course you love him.” “Then why don’t they see that?” Davey asked as his shoulders began to shake with suppressed sobs. “Why do they have to be so damn angry and badmouth him every chance they get?” “Maybe they’re hurt and don’t know any other way to express the hurt.” I offered and he seemed to mull over the statement. “Davey, it doesn’t justify them hurting you in the process, but it might explain why…” “It’s so fucking unfair!” Davey growled before giving in to the tears with a sniffle.His eyes were leaking the tears now and he wiped his nose with the back of a hand. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be…” “Shhh.” I said softly, moving my chair around the table towards him, and when I reached my arms out he fell into them, resting his head on my shoulder as he just sobbed.“Let it out, Davey, you can let it out here.” “It’s just so unfair.” He moaned again while his entire body shook. I looked up to see my parents standing in the doorway with looks of sorrow and approval mixed on their faces. They nodded briefly before my father put an arm around my mother, who was wearing her rose-colored nightgown, and they walked back to their room.Davey was oblivious to their presence as he cried into my shoulder for a long time. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you like this…” “Promise me you’ll return the favor if I ever need it.” I said softly as he pulled back from leaning on me.For a long time he looked deeply into my eyes before nodding. “If you ever need me, I’ll be there.” He promised fervently and I smiled. “Good, I can always use a good friend.” I said just as fervently and he actually smiled in response to me. “You about ready for bed?” “Yeah, I could use some sleep.” He said with a yawn, and we put the empty glasses of milk away before heading into my room. Davey paused hesitantly when I shut the door behind me and looked at me with a questioning expression. “Um right or left side?” “I’ll take the right.” I said, remembering how he always liked sleeping on the left.He nodded, and turned his back to me as he began to get undressed. I could see the way he sneaked a look at me as I got ready for bed, but when I climbed into bed after him, there was a good arm’s length between us.He let out a heavy sigh as he fell asleep with his back to me, but I lay awake for a long time, listening to his breathing. Part of me still missed my Davey, and our kids, but another part of me was looking forward to a new lifetime, knowing the man I had spent so many years loving was still here, deep down in this Davey Jones. Chapter 7 “Boys, you better get a move on if you want some of this food mom’s cooking!” Dad’s voice, and his fist banging on the door woke me up the next morning and I started with surprise. Sometime during the night, the arm’s length between us had disappeared, and my arms were wrapped around Davey, who had his back to me. My morning erection was sticking out the top of my underwear, and it was nestled tightly against Davey’s back, where he could probably feel it as he stirred. With flaming cheeks, I pushed myself back a bit from him, but didn’t remove my arms from around him. He was shifting now, and I wondered if I could casually move my hands down from his chest and feel his own morning erection, and part of me wanted to do that, but I knew it was not time for that yet.Still, it was nice having him in my arms. “We’re getting up, dad!” I called out and my father moved off.To my surprise, Davey started chuckling and actually leaned back against me, although he arched his back so it wouldn’t come into contact with my erection. “Good morning.” I whispered to him, and he started laughing harder.“What’s so funny?” “Oh, I don’t know.” Davey whispered and turned sideways so he could look at my face.There was a broad smile on his.“Marcie would have a coronary if she walked in now, and your dad probably would too. Thanks though.I hope it’s not too freaky for you waking up like this.I had a nightmare and the next thing I knew you were hugging me and it just…” “I’m not freaked out.” I assured him and he arched an eyebrow with a semi-familiar leer on his face. “Really, what about if I did this?” He said before leaning forward like he was going to kiss me.I pulled back and slapped his chest, causing him to push my hands away and they ended up on his belly. “Dude, what the fuck is this?” I asked, slapping his belly and he frowned before defensively pushing my hands away. “I know I need to lose weight.” He grumbled. “It’s just tough you know, working in a fucking fast food place and never really having all that much time for a real meal, and Nanny’s always pushing food at me as if that’ll make the world better and I don’t have any time for exercise.” “Bullshit.” I said firmly, sitting up enough to rest my head on my right hand while looking at him sternly. “We’ll make time.I tell you what, I usually run three times a week in the mornings. You and I will meet at the school an hour before school starts and go running.” “You want me to give up an hour of sleep?” Davey said with a startled look.“Do you know how little sleep I get as it is?I can’t even crawl into bed until after Nanny and Papa finish watching the news. Then it’s another thirty minutes before they finish locking up, setting the alarms and actually get into bed.” “I thought you couldn’t go home if it was after eleven-thirty and they’re still up?” I exclaimed in confusion and he frowned. “Nanny would try to sneak me in, but if I’m not back yet, Papa gets up five minutes early and turns on the alarm.” Davey answered. “She doesn’t know the code and he won’t tell anyone else at all, and he’s the type that would wait for the police to show up and have them haul me off.” “Sometimes I don’t get your grandfather at all.” I said, full well being able to imagine Pete doing that if he was pissed enough. “Yeah, well, enough of that.” Davey said with false cheerfulness.“Whatever your mom’s cooking sure smells good.” “I’ve got dibs on the shower.” I said with a smile as I hopped out of bed.Davey just stretched before laying back down, and I couldn’t help but smile as I noticed him pulling my pillow to him when he thought I’d left the room. Mom had delivered Davey’s clean clothes while I was in the shower and he was already dressed as I entered with nothing but a towel around my waist.He blushed before stammering out that he’d be in the dining room, and I smirked to myself. Davey was such a contradiction, fluctuating between being flirty with me and embarrassed about being caught looking at me.Since we’d probably be leaving soon after breakfast, I dressed in an old pair of jeans and equally old shirt that was only a little tight, but it did show off my chest fairly well. Davey was wearing the clothes he’d worn to school yesterday, although they were freshly cleaned by mom. “You young men mind if I go along with you?” Dad asked as we ate the pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs that mom had cooked. “I was once a fair hand with cars.” “Sure.” Davey said after looking at me for approval.If Dad wanted to help, I wasn’t going to argue.He was definitely better than me when it came to cars. “Good, after we finish here I’ll get my tools.” Dad said and Davey breathed a sigh of relief. “I was worried I might have to ask my father for help.” He said in answer to dad’s questioning look. “When I wrecked mom’s car after getting my license he had to help me fix the rear axle I bent.” “Don’t worry about that.” Dad said firmly, but there was a gentle smile on his face that seemed to encourage Davey. “I appreciate all the help you’re giving me.” Davey said politely, but the undertones in his voice showed how much he meant every word. “It’s nothing.” Mom said with a smile. “Besides, if it’s keeping Brian out of trouble, it’s all to the good.” “Hey!” I protested, but she was already laughing with dad.When breakfast was done, we headed out and dad followed us in his car after loading it with some tools. Davey kept up an easy monologue for a while, talking about a friend of his from Nevada.It was obvious he missed the place, and had been happy there.From what my Davey had told me of the place and living there the second time he’d gone back, I could understand this Davey missing the place. “What the hell?” Davey asked as we pulled into the parking lot of the McDonald’s.Like all the employees he parked near the back, and as we pulled into the spot next to his car, I could see why he was upset.Both tires on this side were flat, and more than likely the other two were as well, which we learned after getting out of the car and looking at the other side. Dad pulled up behind us, and was looking at the car with a grim expression while Davey fingered the slit edge of the rear driver’s side tire.Someone had done a good job slitting his tires, and a rage built in my gut as I took a good guess as to who was responsible. “I’m going to fucking kill her.” I said in a very loud voice while a slender, older woman in a manager’s uniform walked out of the restaurant. “Brian, watch your language!” Dad said sharply as Davey stood up and turned around.His eyes were moist, and his lower lip quivered. I wanted to wrap my arms around him and comfort him, but I knew that this was not the place or the time. “How am I going to pay for this?” Davey moaned softly.“Jenny’s psychotherapist needs to be paid and I have to make the car payment and I could barely scrounge up enough for a starter and…” “David?” The female manager asked in a worried tone.“I’m sorry David, I tried calling your house to tell you this morning when I came in but they said you were over at a friend’s.” “I… my car wouldn’t start last night and Brian picked me up.” Davey said in a weak voice. He shook his head slightly as she moved to stand next to him.“Janice, the tires were fine when I left last night.” “They were fine when the closers left.” Janice said in a worried tone.“I don’t understand why someone would do this, you’re the sweetest boy here.” “It wasn’t someone from the restaurant.” I said through gritted teeth and Davey looked up at me with a worried look. “She wouldn’t do this, would she?” He asked and his lower lip started quivering again.“Why would she do this to me?” “Why do you think Marcie did this, Brian?” Dad asked in a low, quiet tone that was still filled with fatherly command. “She saw us last night when we were pulling out of the restaurant, and she gave us both a dirty look.” I said, not wanting to get into the part about her going down on Spencer. Had she gotten him to do it?In a selfish way I hoped it had been him and not – not Trevor or Brandon. “So you think she’d take her anger out on David?” Dad said with a questioning tone.“That doesn’t make a lot of sense.” “Who is this Marcie?” Janice asked coldly. “Brian’s ex-girlfriend.” Davey said softly. “What would she have against you?” Janice asked him. “It’s not so much Davey directly as anyone she sees me with.” I explained what I thought was her reasoning. Yeah, I was calming down, but I was still pissed. While I seriously doubted Brandon or Trevor might say something to her about my interest in Davey, I was seriously regretting having ever shared that with them. “She’s a vindictive bi–woman.” “If she ever comes into my restaurant, I want you to point her out to me, you hear me David?” Janice said vehemently. “I want to throw her out on her ass and never let her back in here.” “Thanks, Janice.” Davey said with a slight chuckle that faded away as he looked back at his car.That was when I noticed that dad wasn’t by us anymore, but was at the payphone near the entrance. “It’s not a problem, David, and I want you to take the day off to get this fixed.” She said firmly and Davey started to protest. “I can’t, I’m going to need the money more now that I have to pay for all this!”He protested vehemently. “I’m paying you for the day as long as you keep your mouth shut about me being anything other than a cranky old witch, you hear me?” She said in a tone that brooked no argument. He sighed before swallowing glumly and looking at her for a long moment. “Thank you.” He said softly and she patted him on the back before heading back inside.Davey turned to look at the car again, and his shoulders started to shake again. Damn appearances to hell, I decided and stepped up beside him, putting an arm over his shoulder and pulling him in tight for a one-armed hug. “I’m supposed to be the one who helps people, not the one getting help.” Davey muttered bitterly. “This isn’t your fault.” I told him softly. “I’m sorry she did this and I want to help fix it, okay?” “I’ll figure something out.” Davey muttered. “Davey, I bear some responsibility for this.” I said firmly.“Let me pay my part, please.” “I’ve called a tow-truck.” Dad said as he approached us again. I looked up from Davey’s car to see him nodding in approval at my comforting Davey. “I’ll pay for it, Mr. B.” Davey said and a fleeting smile crossed my lips at the fond shortening of my father’s last name that he’d used in the last timeline, first as Mr. B and then as Dad B as time went by. “You’ll do no such thing.” Dad said in a voice that jerked Davey’s head up. “But it’s my car and…” Davey started to protest and Dad held up a hand to stop him from going any further. “David, I’m going to ask you a few questions and I want you to answer them honestly, okay?” Dad asked in a softer tone. “If, after I’m done asking them, you still don’t want my help that will be that, okay?” “Okay.” Davey said sullenly. “What do you do with most of your paycheck?” Dad asked, already knowing the answer. “Most of it goes to help Mom and Jenny.” Davey answered. “I make my car payments, insurance, gas and all that with the rest.” “You’ve told me that before, so it was just a warm-up.” Dad said.“Now, here’s the important question, if you have to pay for tires and the repairs to your car, how is that going to affect the rest of your family?” “Jenny will have to miss a few sessions, and she’s just starting to make real progress.” Davey said with a frown. “I’ll end up behind on the car payments too, and since Nanny co-signed the loan she’ll have to make them up until I can pay her back and that’ll make it more difficult to stay in the city, even with your help, while mom has her surgery.” “Would you object to me helping out your sister, your mother, or your grandmother?” Dad asked and I smiled at where he was going with this.It was like he knew Davey almost as well as I did, and it was just the right argument to use. I should have thought of this first, what with how well I knew Davey’s stubborn pride. “No.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Then think of it as helping you help them.” Dad said gently and Davey nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Breckenridge.” He said to my father. “You’re a good young man, David.” Dad said firmly, staring into Davey’s eyes.“Don’t let life’s little challenges bow you down, and don’t refuse help freely offered with no strings attached.” “I’ll pay you back, I promise.” Davey said firmly. “How about you pay me back some other way than money?” Dad asked. “Like what?” Davey asked as a tow-truck pulled into the parking lot. “Let me think on that for a while.” Dad asked him. “I promise, we’ll work something out, but I don’t want to take needed cash away from your family.” “As long as we can work something out.” Davey said stubbornly and Dad reached out his hand for them to shake on it. As the tow-truck driver got out, I dropped my arm from around Davey’s shoulders, and he straightened up a bit as Dad went to talk to the driver. “I never should have called you for help last night.” Davey sighed softly, more to himself than to me, and I knew what he was saying.He wasn’t blaming me, he was blaming himself. “You’re right.” I said firmly and he looked up in surprise.“If you hadn’t called me you’d have not had your tires slashed.I’m sorry.” “That’s not what I meant!” Davey protested, but when he saw me smiling he stopped and started chuckling. “Okay, I get your point.” “Good, don’t forget it again.” I said as sternly as I could. “Brian you need to move your car for the driver to get David’s car on the flatbed.” Dad said to me as he finished talking with the beefy truck driver.“David, you’ve got the day off, and I’m going to head over to the garage with the tow-truck to get things started.It’s a good thing I know one that’s open today.If they can’t get it done today, Brian will drive you around to where you need to go for the weekend since he bears some obligation based on what he thinks happened. If you want to spend the night again, you’re more than welcome.I do suggest you stop by your house to let your family know you’re okay, though.” “We can do that first.” I said with a smile before Davey could protest.He took one look at my father’s face and slowly nodded his agreement. “Good, now Brian, here’s your allowance for the week, have fun with it.” Dad said, handing me another wad of cash, and I knew it wasn’t my allowance.Breaking all conventions of being a teenager, I hugged my father there in plain view of anyone driving by, and he patted me on the back before pushing me off towards my mustang. Davey stuck his hand out and my dad pulled him in for a hug too.Unlike me, Davey stayed in the hug a bit longer, soaking up the affection my father was so freely offering, and he was almost smiling when he got into the car. He’d handed Dad the keys to his car before getting into mine. “So, we’re off!” I said in high spirits, pretending not to notice how he looked back at his car with a worried look before I pulled onto McHenry and headed south towards Ceres. Davey sat quietly for most of the drive, brooding most likely about his car and I knew enough not to bother him as I turned onto J Street before heading down 9th towards Ceres.He snapped out of the brooding when I pulled onto Highway 99, which 9th Street turned into just south of the only gay dance club in Modesto. “You need to take Whitmore.” Davey said softly and I nodded.He then spoke only to give me directions, which I followed without telling him I knew where his grandparents lived.I’d been to both their houses in the last timeline, and both his mother’s parents and his father’s mother had lived in their houses until they’d died in the last timeline. They were right around the corner from each other, and I had never appreciated how rough that must have been in this timeline, when the two sides of his family blamed each other for the problems associated with Davey’s father. If I remembered it correctly, and I was certain I did, Grandma Jones blamed Davey’s mother for having Davey’s father arrested. Davey’s mother rightly blamed his father for what he’d done to Jenny.She’d pressed charges so that Jenny could get help from the state for her counseling but that had only lasted a year and now Davey was helping to make the payments for the continued counseling. Davey’s grandparents’ home was the same ugly dark green I remembered it being in this timeframe, and I recognized his mother’s RX-7 parked in front of it, plus the large brown Buick his grandmother drove, as well as the large light-brown van that was his grandfather’s. I parked in by his mother’s car, and got out with him. “You sure about having me over for the weekend?” Davey asked me.“I’ve got to work tomorrow too.” “It won’t be a problem.” I assured him. “We can work on our history project later.” “Okay.” Davey said and then he paused before the sidewalk that led up to the house.There was a frown on his face.“I should warn you, it’s barely ten in the morning and my grandmother and mother usually lounge around in their nightgowns until around noon.” “Don’t worry, I’m not going to embarrass you at school.” I assured him with a laugh, remembering a few times we’d come over here in the last timeline to find his grandmother still in her furry pink housecoat at two in the afternoon on Saturdays.He chuckled for a moment before getting his brooding look back and we headed up to the door.The fact that Davey didn’t have a key to the door wasn’t really a surprise considering his grandfather’s attitude, but I wondered how a person could call anyplace a home when he didn’t have the keys to get inside. “You’re home!” Monta Barrow, Davey’s grandmother said after Davey had rung the doorbell.Sure enough she was wearing her fuzzy pink robe.She looked slightly embarrassed when she saw me standing behind Davey. “Who is this?” “Nanny, this is my friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Davey said softly.“Brian, this is my grandmother, Monta Barrow.” “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Barrow.” I said politely and she smiled slightly. “I wish I’d known you were bringing company, Davey!” She chided him in a loving tone. “I’m just lounging here in my robe having a cup of coffee!Come in, boys. It’s nice to meet you, Brian.” The house was exactly as I remembered it being, with the kitchen immediately off to the right and a short entryway leading off to the right towards the living room and a hallway down the left leading to the bedrooms and bathrooms.Right at the end of the entryway was a big mirror running from floor to ceiling, and I was struck by how young I looked in the reflection. Every time I saw myself, I was reminded at how young I looked when just a short while ago I had looked far older than Davey’s grandmother. “Are you boys hungry?” She asked as she led us through the kitchen towards the attached dining room where Davey’s mother was sipping a cup of hot tea, wearinga black velvet robe with red piping.Her brown curly hair was slightly matted and her eyes had a pinched look to them, probably from pain, as Davey introduced us. “No thanks, Nanny, Brian’s mom made breakfast for us a few hours ago.” Davey answered his grandmother’s question. “What’s wrong with your car?” Davey’s mother said shortly, and I realized it was more from the fact that she was having trouble breathing than from anger.Davey might not have realized that from the defensive look on his face. “The starter’s gone bad on it.” Davey said, and when he said nothing about the tires, I took the hint and decided not to mention them.“It’s being fixed.” “Oh great, how are we going to afford that?” His mother moaned and I was amazed at how different she was than the self-confident, always calm and prepared woman I’d known in the last timeline. “Brian’s father is paying for it.” Davey said weakly.“He’s loaning me the money.” “The same man who is helping us with a place to stay in the city?” Nanny asked as she sat down with her cup of coffee. Davey and I both sat at the large oval table as well. “Yes, the same man.” Davey said softly. “Your father is truly a Christian man.” Nanny said to me and it was hard not to laugh.Dad hadn’t set foot inside a church in years, but I understood her sentiment. “Why would he do that?” Davey’s mom asked. “What’s in it for him?” “I’ll pay him back, it’s just a loan.” Davey said, stretching the truth just a bit, but from the way his mother relaxed slightly I got the feeling it was the right thing to say. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work in a little bit?” His mother asked him sharply, and I began to wonder at the deep differences she was showing.It was almost like she was going out of her way to find things wrong with Davey, and that worried me more than anything.Maybe it was just the pain she was in right now. “Janice gave me the day off, with pay.” Davey said defensively, his face clouding over. “I asked Davey if we could use the time to work on our history project some more.” I said, jumping into the fray when she opened her mouth to say something.It was probably going to be something scathing from the look on her face, but she looked at me with cloudy eyes, as if seeking to find something wrong with what I said. “Who is this?” A familiar gruff voice asked from the kitchen and I looked up to see Davey’s grandfather standing near the coffee pot, pouring himself a cup of coffee.He was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt and had a grumpy look on his face. “This is one of Davey’s friends.” Nanny answered in a knowing tone of voice.I stood up and took a few steps towards him with my hand held out as he looked me up and down. “My name is Brian Breckenridge, Mr. Barrow.” I said in a polite voice, shaking his hand firmly as he squeezed mine in a testing manner.He looked me in the eyes for a long moment before letting a grunt. “A sight better than that other boy Davey brought around a couple of weeks ago.” He harrumphed before releasing my hand and sitting down at the head of the table.“What’s wrong with that stupid car of yours now, Davey?” “Starter’s out, Papa.” Davey said. “You going to want my help to fix it?” He asked as if the notion was a noxious idea, but I was pretty sure I saw a glint of something deep in his eyes. “Um, Brian’s dad is having it worked on.” Davey said.“He’s loaning me the money to fix it and I’ll pay him back.” “See that you do, boy.” Papa said gruffly, and while there was a hint of disappointment in his eyes, I could see there was also a grudging respect.Was it respect because Davey had found a solution to the problem without having to get help? That would fit the Pete Barrow I’d known before. “I will, Papa.” Davey said plaintively, getting a frown from the old man. “What’s your father do, young man?” Pete asked me directly and I smiled. “He’s a manager at Union Bank in Modesto.” I answered and he frowned for a moment. “I think I know him.” Pete said with a shake of his head.“You’ve got his eyebrows if it’s him that I remember.” “You know him.” I said with a slight laugh and he nodded his head.The man always did make me a little nervous.“Have you been fishing lately?I saw your boat around the side of the house.” “It’s too damn cold right now.” He grunted. “You fish?” “A little.” I admitted honestly. “Dad and I usually try to make it up for a camping trip during the spring at least once a year.” “I’ll have to invite him the next time I go.” Pete said as if it was a burden, but I could see a little gleam in his eye. “Kind of in the way of thanking him for his helping the family.Maybe we’ll drag you two boys with us.” “I…” Davey started to try backing out from the look on his face, but my stomping on his foot stopped him cold. “That’d be nice, Mr. Barrow.” I said calmly, ignoring the glare from Davey.“I’m sure my dad would like to do that.” “Good.” He said with a nod before getting up from his seat.“You boys going to hang around here today or what?” “We’ve got a history project to work on for school, sir.” I said and he looked at me for a long moment. “You better make sure he puts some effort into it.” Pete said with a scowl.“If he wants to get into college he’s going to have to work harder at his books than he has been.” “We will.” I said while Davey scowl returned. “Good, then it’s been nice meeting you.” Pete said before taking his coffee with him into the living room where he used the patio sliding door to get into the back yard.Davey was staring at me like I was a demon or something, and his grandmother and mother were also looking at me like they’d never seen someone like me before.It was then that I realized why I’d liked Pete so much.He reminded me so much of Davey when Davey got older, although Davey was never quite as gruff. “So how long will you be gone, Davey?” His mother asked him after a long silence while everyone stared at me.It seemed that, with Pete’s approval of Davey going to study at my house, the matter was settled. “Um, I have to work early in the afternoon tomorrow and Brian’s offered to give me a ride, so I was going to ask if I could stay over at his place tonight.” Davey said softly. “What’ll you do if your car’s not fixed by Monday?” His grandmother asked.“I’ve got to take your mother to the city for a doctor’s appointment Monday, and she’s got to go for more tests here in town for most of Tuesday.” “I can either pick him up or drop him off here, or he can stay at our place until his car is fixed.” I spoke up before Davey could answer.“My parents said it was okay.They understand how tough things are right now, and that your first priority has to be getting ready for your surgery.” “That’s mighty kind of your folks.” Monta Barrow said with a smile.“Shantill’s mother is going to be staying here while I run Sandy around, so that’ll work just fine.” “You will call, won’t you, Davey?” His mother asked in a worried tone, and Davey got up to hug her tightly. “It’s only for a day or two, Mom.” Davey said softly.“Everything’s going to be fine. The doc’s going to do this surgery and you’re going to feel better than you have in years.” “I hope so.” She said softly, all the edge of anger gone from her voice as they hugged.There were tears in my eyes, and I remembered how devoted Davey had been to his mother.Despite the anger that often flared between them, they’d been close, almost as if their bickering and arguing was a glue that bound them together. “I better get some clothes.” Davey said softly, breaking the hug and looking over at me with a hint of a sarcastic smile. “Let me show you my ‘room’, Brian.” “Okay” I said while noticing the look of hurt that went across his grandmother’s face.She gave me a wan smile as I stood up and followed Davey down into the ‘family room’.It was really just a step down from the dining room.A big-screen projection television dominated the far end of the room, and we walked behind the two armchairs and around the couch where a twin bed was stuffed up against the far wall.A stereo sat on a speaker, although the large headphones attested to the fact that music was rarely ever played over the speaker.A dresser stood against the wall, and to the immediate right were the sliding doors that hid the washer and dryer.My heart went out to Davey at the total lack of privacy, since we could hear his mother and grandmother talking in quiet but urgent tones in the dining room. “Welcome to my little corner of paradise.” Davey said softly in a voice that dripped with sarcasm.He pulled out a paper bag from a corner since he’d left his duffel bag at my house, and began to open the drawers of the small dresser and pulled out some clothes.“How much should I pack?” “Enough for today and tomorrow, at least.” I said. “Your uniform’s still at the house.” “That’s right.” He said as he pulled out a couple pairs of frayed underwear, some socks with holes in them, and a pair of jeans and two shirts that had seen better days.He put them in the bag, folded the top over and smiled.“Well, I’m ready.” “Let’s head out.” I said as nicely as I could. The feelings running through me were mixed at best.Part of me felt really bad for him having to live like this, but another part of me remembered the look of hurt in his grandmother’s face and I felt bad for her.",

      "content": "“David, honey, did you say your mom was going to be at Children’s Hospital?” Mom asked after a few minutes. “Yes, in San Francisco.” Davey answered after he swallowed a bite of his food. “You’ll be going up to see her, of course.” Mom said. “Yes.” Davey answered although he frowned slightly. “I can’t miss much more school and Mom’s forbidden me from going up there during the week, but I plan on going up there all weekend long while she’s there. Nanny’s trying to find a hotel room she can afford so she’ll be up there all the time and Jenny gets to go for the day of Mom’s surgery and the day after. I wanted to go, but they’re saying I’ve missed too many days of school this year.” “Coach Cole said you’d be sent to alternative school if you missed more than one more day.” I said quickly, so my parents knew the score on that matter. Davey grimaced at me, but didn’t object. “Brian, would you object?” Dad asked and I knew right away what he was going to suggest. Without hesitating I shook my head. “Davey, has Brian told you about his apartment that he owns?” “You own an apartment?” Davey asked with surprise as he turned to look at me. “Yeah, it used to belong to my Uncle Rich.” I answered. “He left it to me when he died back in ’81.” “Oh.” Davey said with a weird look on his face. “It’s in San Francisco, and currently not occupied.” Dad said, drawing Davey’s attention back to him. “We’ve kept the furniture that was in it when Richard passed away and have rented it out to students and other people who don’t have a lot of their own furniture. Only thing is, right now there’s no one in there and the last few people who’ve applied we haven’t really liked. There’s no reason, if Brian agrees, that we couldn’t leave it vacant until your mother’s surgery and allow your grandmother to stay there, and of course you and your sister could stay there too when you go up to visit your mother on the weekends.” “That would be nice, but Nanny won’t just accept charity.” Davey said with a sigh. “Then we’ll charge her a fair rate.” Dad said with a smile. “If you want, you can tell her about it sometime this week and have her call Brenda to discuss the details.” “I’ll do that.” Davey said and paused for a moment before getting a look on his face that I knew was his ‘woops, forgot something’ look. “Um, thanks, all of you.” “You’re welcome.” Dad said with a smile and gave me a sharp look. “Brian, take notes from this guy. He sure knows how to be polite.” “Yeah, whatever.” I said with a typical teenage eye roll, although sometime soon he was going to get a big hug from me for being so generous. That seemed to end the subject of Davey’s family life for a bit, and not once had they brought up Davey’s father. While my parents began to tell the typical funny stories from my childhood, stories I blushed at like a typical teenager, I could see Davey relaxing. His shoulders weren’t hunched up anymore. He was sitting back in his chair, and a smile was on his face the entire time. I laughed as well, and listened with interest as the stories reached the point where I was older than twelve. From the stories they told after that point, it became clear that was where my life of this timeline diverted from the one I remembered. Meeting Davey along the bike path on the way to the first day of the seventh grade seemed to be the key difference. We skipped desert and headed back home, all four of us smiling as we left the restaurant. My parents seemed to genuinely like Davey, something that despite the last timeline I’d been a little nervous about. If things went well, and Davey once again ended up with me, there should be no problems with them accepting him as family. Dad already seemed protective of Davey in a way that I totally hadn’t expected. No one else had arrived by the time we got home, which wasn’t all that unexpected. We had another twenty minutes before the party was supposed to start. While Mom worked on the last little touches for the party, Dad gave Davey a tour of the house, including the old weight set in the garage. I could see the sparkle of interest in Davey’s eyes that he quickly suppressed. That encouraged me a bit, considering his current lack of physical fitness. He at least harbored a desire to work out again, and if he was given the chance, probably would. Trevor was the first to arrive, pulling up on his motorcycle. Brandon showed up not more than two minutes later, and the other three people I’d invited arrive moments later. Mom had been surprised by the modest number of people I’d invited. Apparently, last year I’d had nearly forty people over. Despite the fact that I’d told people to not bring gifts, Brandon had a small gift-wrapped package in his hands and everyone else had cards. Even Davey produced a card from somewhere. It was awkward for a few minutes as they all stood in the living room while my mom brought the cake into the dining room. Davey’s friend’s, Ronna (who was in our history class), Jeannette (the thin brown-haired girl whose braces had finally corrected her buck teeth), and the thin, red-haired boy Todd who I’d spoken to at school all stood behind Davey. Brandon and Trevor stood near me, looking at the three they didn’t really know. “Where are the girlfriends?” I asked my two friends. I’d invited their girlfriends out of politeness. “They wouldn’t come.” Trevor said sourly while looking over the two girls standing next to Davey, now talking to him quietly. “This is from Marcie.” Brandon said as he tried to hand the package over to me. I flushed with anger at that. “Take it back to her.” I said. “No, I’m not playing gofer for you two.” Brandon snarled as he threw the package down onto the couch. “You give it back to her tomorrow at school.” “Fine.” I said with a sigh as I scooped up the package and put it on the fireplace mantle. I turned to Davey’s friends then, giving up on Brandon and Trevor for the moment. “Thanks for coming.” “Thanks for inviting us.” Jeannette said with a smile that caused me to worry for a moment. “How about all of you come in the dining room?” Mom called out. “The cake’s ready.” What followed was a very uncomfortable forty minutes as they sang happy birthday to me and I blew out the candles before Dad cut the cake. My parents really saved the night by asking all sorts questions of the three people they didn’t know, and dragging both Brandon and Trevor into the discussion at different points. I was actually relieved to see Brandon and Trevor leave early. Certainly the explanations of how Ronna, Davey, Jeannette, and Todd all knew each other was a lot freer and more enjoyable. Todd had some funny stories of Davey in an eighth grade math class they’d shared. I’d never heard the story of crazy Mrs. Dent, her good guy/bad guy explanation of multiplying negative numbers, nor the funny story about sticks of Big Red gum being exchanged behind her back. Considering Todd’s red hair, I had to wonder if he’d been making passes at Davey all that time or if they’d actually done something together. That made me slightly jealous, and I debated on whether I should have invited him or not, but realized there was nothing I could do about it if something had happened. It was just as much my fault as it would be Davey’s. We had still bumped into each other, according to Ronna’s story about the first time she ever saw me, but there had been no conversation. In my timeline, I’d actually bumped into Sean, but Davey told me that the first time it had been him I’d bumped into. Still, in this time, we’d never chatted, never became friends. I’d apparently walked off without a word except for my angry exclamation at him that he’d ignored. It was almost funny how one little thing could cause such a big difference. “If you kids would like to go out and ditch the old folks, we wouldn’t mind.” Mom said after another twenty minutes had passed. That surprised me since I was supposedly still grounded, but Dad nodded his agreement. “Just be back by midnight, son.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. They’d given me some nice gifts, new clothes and a new watch that was pretty cool. “I know just the place to go.” Ronna said with a smile as we headed out of the house. “I’ll drive.” I offered and everyone agreed. Davey sat in front while the other three piled into the back of my Mustang. Following Ronna’s directions we ended up at a deserted park near the river. After I parked the car, we all piled out and Ronna led us to some bench tables that were actually near the water. Jeannette was carrying a backpack she’d come into the house with and she produced two thermos bottles as we sat down. “What did you bring?” Davey asked with far too much excitement in his voice for my comfort. I wasn’t born yesterday, and put teenagers, dark location near a river, and thermos bottles together and I came up with some kind of alcohol. “Screwdrivers, just the way you like it, Davey dear.” Ronna said with a smile. “Cool.” Todd said with a smile. Davey was sitting next to Ronna with Jeannette on the other side and Todd was next to me on the other side of the table. Jeannette handed one thermos to me and the other to Davey. “Drink up birthday boy.” Jeannette said with a dazzling smile. “Uh, I’m driving, I shouldn’t drink.” I said softly. “Oh, c’mon, at least one sip.” Ronna said and I shrugged. One sip wouldn’t hurt. “Oh god.” I said moments later as I coughed. The shit was strong, too damn strong! “Like a touch of orange juice with your vodka, do you?” “Blame Davey.” Ronna said with a laugh as Davey handed her the thermos while I handed mine to Todd. He took a deep gulp, shook his head after swallowing the awfully strong drink and handed the thermos over to Jeannette who took a deep swig. “So what do we do now?” Todd asked. There was just enough light from the moon to see that his eyes were already starting to get glassy. Damn that shit was strong! “It’s a birthday party.” Ronna said with a smile. “How about Truth or Dare?” “Oh god, not that again.” Davey groaned after his fourth swallow of the foul concoction. “What? We haven’t done that in years!” Ronna protested with a laugh. “Yeah, last time you ended up daring me to kiss Mardi McFarland and she followed me around all eighth grade like she was convinced I was going to marry her.” Davey groaned. “She still would if you asked her out again.” Jeannette jibed with a laugh. She pulled out a silver pin and put it in the middle of the table. “Okay, here’s a pen we can use since both the thermoses are still full.” “Um, aren’t we a little old for this?” I asked, not totally sure I wanted to be doing this, especially at the rate they were drinking. Todd was halfway drunk already, and Davey looked like he had a good buzz going after his fifth drink from a thermos. “Oh, these are not going to last long at all.” Ronna said with a frown at her thermos. “You sure you don’t want more, birthday boy?” “That’s fine.” I said with a frown. “Good.” Ronna replied, taking another sip while reaching out and spinning the pen. The pointy end stopped facing me and I suppressed a groan while Ronna giggled. “Truth or dare, Brian?” “Truth.” I said, not wanting to be dared to run around the park naked, which I was sure she would have done given the look in her eyes. “Oh you’re no fun.” She moaned. “So, who really broke up with who, you or Marcie?” “She dumped me, but I wanted her to.” I answered sourly and all four of them laughed. “Your turn.” Ronna said with glee and I spun the pen. It landed on Todd. “Truth or Dare?” I asked him with resignation. He actually seemed to think about it for a moment before mumbling ‘truth’ to me. I was feeling a bit pissed and my mouth shot off before I thought about what I was asking. “So do you like Big Red ‘cause it lets you make a joke about your cock?” “Um, um, yeah.” Todd said as his face blushed a bright red and the other three at the table burst out in laughter. Davey almost fell backwards from his laughing and Todd glared at me before spinning the pin. As fate would have it, it landed on Jeannette who demanded a dare. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” Todd said immediately with a triumphant gleam in his eyes as he looked at me before taking the thermos from Davey. Jeannette squealed in happiness and leaned over the table towards me. She got her kiss, and it was a decent one on my part, although she slobbered way too much. It was nothing like kissing my Davey, who was currently sniggering at me. Jeannette’s spin landed on Ronna, and Ronna was dared to kiss me. She was definitely better than Jeannette, and quite good at using her tongue, but again she wasn’t Davey. “Dare.” Todd said with a wicked smile when Ronna’s spin landed on him. Ronna’s answering smile spelled trouble and she proved it immediately. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” She said in a wicked tone. Ronna and Davey burst out in laughter, leaning against each other while Todd looked stricken. He gulped and looked at me hesitantly while I let out a groan. “Oh come on, it’s just a game!” Ronna nearly shouted amidst her laughter. “Am I going to have to kiss everyone at this table?” I growled, setting off a fresh round of laughter. I was irritated at the childish game, but I grabbed Todd’s head with both hands and brought him in for a kiss, tongue and all. After a surprised moment, he returned the kiss, to my surprise, and he was better than either of the girls had been. I broke the kiss when I started to harden. The slacks I was wearing wouldn’t hide an erection for long. “Oh, that was priceless!” Jeannette giggled. “I wish I had a camera!” “Spin.” I growled at Todd who was licking his lips and looking at me in a way that made me uncomfortable. Had he enjoyed the kiss? His spin landed on Davey, and Davey let out a groan. “Don’t tell me, you dare me to kiss Brian.” Davey said with what I was hoping was just mock horror. Todd squeaked out a ‘you bet’ and Davey looked at me expectantly. We both leaned across the table, and my body tingled as our lips touched for the first time in this reality. Despite the smell of vodka and orange juice on his breath, it was a wonderful moment as our lips touched and our tongues sought each other’s mouth. It ended all too soon, and I sat down in a hurry when I realized I was now fully erect. “Oh god, that was just too fucking hot.” Jeannette murmured while Ronna shot me a look that could only be described as jealousy. Davey was hunched over in that now-familiar gesture that something had embarrassed him. If he was as hard as I was, which I hoped, then I could understand his posture. He took a very long gulp from a thermos before spinning the pen, which landed on Jeannette, who was now looking thoughtful. “Truth.” She said, changing the tempo of the game. At that moment I was very thankful for that. “Have you ever gone all the way with a guy?” Davey asked her and she blushed. “Yes.” She answered and quickly spun the pen again. It landed on Ronna and Jeannette smiled quickly when Ronna took a dare. “Ronna, I dare you to go for a walk with Davey for at least ten minutes.” “That’s easy.” Ronna said as she got to her feet, only slightly unsteady, and pulled Davey up before taking his arm and walking off towards some trees. “Oh thank God.” Jeannette said as she swallowed some more alcohol. “That was the whole purpose of that game. Sorry you had to kiss two guys on your birthday, Brian.” “Don’t worry.” I said with a shrug. “What do you mean that was the whole purpose?” “Oh, it’s just that Ronna’s been interested in Davey for years and she’s finally gotten the nerve up to tell him.” Jeannette said. She was slurring her words slightly, and Todd was taking another long pull from the other thermos. “She’s going to tell him she likes him and ask him to go out with her. I think she’s hoping to get some action while she’s out there, too.” “Oh.” I said with shock, not sure how to react. Yeah, Davey was gay, but he could still choose to date her and pretend. It wasn’t like he was out or anything. Only a hand on my thigh broke that jealous thought and suddenly I was faced with another problem. The hand could only be Todd’s, and when I didn’t react immediately, his hand slid further up my thigh until it was cupped over my erection. Jeannette had turned her back to us and was watching the river that glinted with reflected moonlight. It was all to surreal for me, as Todd squeezed my erection and I sideways glance revealed a smile on his face. His red hair was longish, and curled around the edges of his pale neck in a way that was suddenly very attractive. Part of me knew it was my seventeen-year old hormones talking, but with Davey off in the trees with a girl he’d known for years and years, and showing no real interest in me beyond friendship, it was almost tempting. Almost, but not quite. I reached down with my hand and gently pulled his off of my crotch. He frowned, and started to look worried, but the soft smile on my face, a squeeze of his hand and a wink put him at ease as I placed his hand on his own leg instead of mine. He let out a sigh as I turned to ask Jeannette a question. The rustling of trees in the distance interrupted me, though, and Davey stomped back over to the table, an angry look on his face. Ronna followed a few seconds later, looking both angry and hurt while Jeannette started to mutter a few curses. There was a tense moment at the table until Davey spoke. “We have school in the morning.” He said in a tight voice. “Brian, you mind dropping us off?” “Sure.” I said flatly, wanting to ask what exactly had happened, but I was also relieved that I knew at least one thing. Davey had not reacted well to whatever Ronna said. It was weird dropping the girls off because Jeannette lived so near the house that I’d always thought of as being Davey’s home. It was empty in this timeline, and my eyes misted over at the thought of all that I had lost from the last timeline. Then again, I’d been an old man there, and my days with Davey Jones had been coming to an end. In a few years we’d both have been dead, and now there was the possibility of another lifetime with him, no matter the troubles that we faced now. “Todd’s house is just a few blocks away.” Davey said and gave me directions. When I pulled up in front of it, he got out with Todd. “Happy birthday, Brian.” Todd said softly. “I had a good time.” “Thanks Todd.” I replied with a genuine smile. “I was glad you could be there.” “Thanks again, Brian.” Davey said as he shut the door and leaned in from the outside. That confused me. I’d planned to have him stay the night since he couldn’t drive with as much alcohol as he’d consumed. “We can get a ride with Todd’s mother in the morning. Would you mind giving me a lift back to your house in the afternoon so I can pick up my car?” “Uh, sure.” I said softly and he smiled before turning to follow Todd in the house. They were inside the nice home for several minutes before I pulled away from the curb. The memory of Todd’s hand on my erection was all too recent and played a major role in my dark thoughts of what would be happening in that house tonight. I knew Davey had no problem with sleeping around in this timeline, and I knew Todd at least played for our team a little bit, and that combination had me imagining the familiar body of Davey’s locked in wild passionate sex with the cute red-head instead of with me, the way he should have been. By the time I got home and inside, the tears in my eyes were more than enough to obscure my vision. Fortunately the parents were in bed, so I could escape to the safety of my bedroom, throw myself down onto my bed and cry myself to sleep over should-have-beens. Chapter 5 “Hey.” I greeted Davey as he sat down in history class.He just mumbled a response, and I was torn between my jealous feelings and sympathy. His eyes were bloodshot, and he was wearing the clothes I’d loaned him for dinner last night.Ronna shuffled in a few moments later, also with bloodshot eyes I noticed as she glared at Davey before sitting on the other side of the room. Davey didn’t even notice her glare, as he was hunched over his desk and fiddling with a notebook. “You doing okay?” I asked Davey quietly after we’d sat there in silence. “Just hung over.” He mumbled. “We didn’t ruin your birthday, did we?” “No.” I lied. “Good.” He replied as the bell rang and Mr. Wansor began the class.He looked disappointed that today there was very little discussion despite his best efforts. I, for one, didn’t feel like adding anything of my own because I was still seething over last night, and Davey going to Todd’s instead of coming home with me. Part of me wanted to be fair, I hadn’t invited Davey to spend the night, but still, him and Todd being together had me riled up. I ate lunch alone that day, being unable to find Davey.Brandon and Trevor left campus with their girlfriends and Marcie, who was now hanging off the arm of Jim McDonald, another player on the football team. Ronna and Jeannette ignored me in the cafeteria, and Todd was sitting with a bunch of friends.So far, my efforts to find out what had happened to Sean were having no results at all. Only a few of those I spoke to barely remembered him at all.It was almost like he’d disappeared off the face of the earth. P.E. got off to a bad start before I’d even changed into my workout gear.Today was a weight-training day, and I was looking forward to it a lot. Working out with weights had always been a stress reliever for me, and the state of my weight equipment in the garage at home told me that I’d gotten out of the habit of using it in the last year. “Yo, Breckenridge.” Reggie’s voice rang out in the locker room.It was a big room, but all of the football team had lockers near each other and Reggie’s was a few feet down from mine.He’d called out just as I was putting my jock strap on. “What?” I practically snarled and he grinned so that his white teeth shone like beacons in his dark face. “I hear Marcie wasn’t happy because you couldn’t satisfy her with your stump of a dick.” He teased, garnering laughs from those nearby.Brandon was sniggering along with the rest of them while Trevor limited himself to a snarky grin. “Man, you should know better than to listen to that bitch’s lies.” I snorted as my mind raced for a comeback. I was just too pissed off by now to be nice. “That cunt was so damn wide open she could fit the entire football team in there at once without feeling a damn thing.” “No shit.” Reggie said with a salacious grin while several people laughed openly at that comment. “Hell, I thought you knew that.” I continued, emboldened by the fact that people were now laughing with me and not at me. “I heard she could never learn to keep her damn legs shut.That’s why I had to dump her, you know.There’s no telling what’s been in her cunt, and I don’t want to catch some nasty disease from her skanky ass.” “Oh man, she’s not going to like that.” Brandon murmured from nearby as everyone laughed. “Who cares?” I responded back angrily as I pulled on some sweat pants.Davey was doing well, not having missed any classes this week, but he milled around as everyone filed into the weight room.Something in me snapped at that point, and I realized that my jealousy was being irrational.My Davey had explained something about himself at this age, in this timeline, and I had to remember that. It was the reason why I hadn’t tripped him into my bed already.The Davey of this timeline pushed away everyone he just had sex with, and I’d seen that when he just blew by Todd in the hallway this morning.If I wanted to not only get Davey into my bed, but keep him there forever, I had to make sure we were close friends first, and make sure that when he did find his way into my bed, that we’d talked about it beforehand, and that he’d opened his mind to being gay and accepted that a relationship between two men was possible.Right now, he believed being gay was a sickness, something to be hidden, and that it was impossible for two men to have a relationship. “You ready for some weights, buddy?” I asked as I came up to Davey and slipped my arm around his shoulder. He stiffened at the touch, but nodded hesitantly before allowing me to lead him into the weight room.What followed was probably the best part of the day, with me taking the time to show him how to correctly use the weight machines. I made sure to talk softly, so it wouldn’t be obvious that he didn’t really know what he was doing, and we spent most of the entire hour in a semi-comfortable almost-silence.We didn’t talk about anything other than our working out, but it seemed to heal the rift that had been between us earlier in the day. On my part, there was just something about being in his presence that soothed me.Even if we weren’t sharing the deepest secrets of our hearts, or for that matter even talking about the weather, at least I was in the room with him and we were interacting.Nor did I miss the way he stared at my crotch as I spotted him on the bench press. He was wearing an old, ragged pair of gray sweats that showed me enough of his reaction that I had to smile for the rest of the class period. No, neither of us was fully hard, but there was some excitement there.Fortunately, no one else was paying much attention to us as we finished our workout and headed into the locker room for showers.As we passed Coach Cole, I noticed the approving nod he gave me, and the very tight smile on his face. “Thanks.” Davey said twenty minutes later as he got out of my car.We were at my place, and he was heading for his car before I’d even turned off the ignition of the mustang. “Hey, you want to come inside?” I asked him and he shook his head. “I’ve got to run by all three restaurants and pick up my paychecks, sign them and get them to Nanny before I change and go to work at the McHenry Avenue one.” Davey said quickly.“Thanks though, I’ll see you in school, tomorrow, right?” “Yep.” I assured him and he smiled again before getting into his car.I stood there and waved as he drove off, not sure if I should have done something to keep him around longer.Damn it all, this was so damn frustrating! How had he done this, navigated the course of what to allow to happen, when to interfere, and all that crap?As unprepared as he was that first time Davey went back in time, he was better prepared in many ways than I was now. He knew the timeline he was changing, I did not. David Jones Sr. was supposed to be on track for becoming President of the United States. Instead he was a convicted child molester who couldn’t get elected as a dogcatcher at this point.Brandon and Trevor were supposed to be our best friends, and instead they frowned about the time I spent with Davey and stayed with girlfriends neither of them really cared about.As for Sean, subtle inquiries by me had not produced even a cold trail. I’d even looked in the phone book for his family and found nothing. He’d told me not to bother looking him up, but he was a friend, or at least he had been a friend in the other timeline. “Brian, honey, you okay?” Mom’s voice from the doorway reminded me I was standing on the edge of our driveway, staring at the spot where Davey’s car had been. “Sorry, just thinking.” I said as I walked up the driveway and gave her a hug.That was one good thing about this timeline; I could still hug my parents. “How was school today?” She asked as she followed me inside the house. “Frustrating.” I answered honestly and got a weird look from her. “That’s a new answer.” She said with a slight smile. “What was so frustrating?” “Just about everything.” I answered honestly, knowing it was a cryptic response and not sure how much could be shared with her without setting off alarm bells.She took that in stride though. “Would you like something to snack on?” She asked. “No thanks, I’ve got to get started on homework.” I replied. “Okay, just let me know.” She said. “I’m working with the foundation on our next fundraiser, so I’ll be in the office.” “Okay.” I replied, not sure exactly what she was talking about.This was part of my problem. As familiar as things were, I still felt like I was living in someone else’s life at times. This wasn’t the past I remembered, and I missed what I remembered.Everything was just too different! The homework was too easy, I realized about an hour later.With a sigh, I put the last of it away and changed into a pair of sweats and a white t-shirt. Maybe I could use the weight set in the garage and work off some of the tension I was feeling. Ten minutes later, as I looked at my weight set, I let out a long sigh.From what I was seeing, it hadn’t been used in at least a year. That gave me a useful task after I opened the garage door for more light and some fresh air.The first job was to get all the dust off the equipment and check to make sure everything was still in useable condition. Twenty minutes later, I was relieved that nothing was irreparably damaged.That was when the sound of a Volkswagen Beetle reached the garage, and a minute later a semi-decrepit 1970’s era lime-green Beetle pulled up in front of the house. A pair of fuzzy dice were even visible hanging from the rear view mirror, and as Todd got out, I found I was smiling. “Hi.” Todd said as he walked up the driveway. He looked a little uncomfortable, as if he wasn’t sure of the reception he’d get, but he did have a half-smile on his face. “Heya Todd.” I replied while being sure to smile. The red-haired guy returned the smile and seemed to relax just a bit.“You look pretty good compared to Davey and Ronna.” “I went home and took a nap after school.” He replied with a slightly wider smile. “So what brings you here?” I asked as I stood up from dusting off a set of fifty-pound weights. “I, uh, I was just in the area.” Todd said with a shrug and an uncomfortable look that said otherwise. “Did you enjoy your birthday?” “It was nice.” I said noncommittally. He put his hands in his jean pockets and lowered his head a bit, looking at me through his reddish bangs. “I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable last night.” He said in a breathy voice, with the words tumbling out one after the other. “I swear I don’t know what happened. All that alcohol and those stupid dares…” “Don’t sweat it.” I said with a shrug. What followed was one of those uncomfortable silences that happen from time to time. From the way Todd kept looking around, and returning to me over and over again, I knew he wanted to say something more about the previous night, but he was scared. “I, um, uh, about last night, you know, um, you won’t say anything, right?” Todd managed to stammer out and I almost laughed, but quickly suppressed the smile that was starting to form on my face. “Like I’m going to tell people I kissed you and Davey?” I said with a snort and he seemed to relax slightly. “Sorry, I was just, um, well you know.” Todd said with a shrug as he blushed. “Know what?” I asked with real curiosity. “I mean, I’m not going to end up stuffed in a garbage can or anything, right?” Todd said in a rush. “When was the last time I’ve done that?” I asked rhetorically, but an old memory surfaced, and I could feel the blood draining from my face. “Well, do you remember Sean in freshman year?” Todd said with a little bit of fire appearing in his voice.It disappeared quickly as he looked at me with a little bit of fear and I started to feel ashamed. I wasn’t the Brian that had done that.In my own time, someone like Todd would never have been afraid of me, but this wasn’t my timeline was it? Still, the mention of Sean, and the hint of familiarity in his voice gave me a bit of hope. “I remember him.” I said with a frown, pulling up that memory of a conversation between Sean and Davey that we had witnessed. I hadn’t thought about it for decades, but it was crystal clear in my mind’s eye now. “He…” “You guys were kind of mean to him.” Todd finished when I paused.He looked at me sideways, as if afraid of my reaction. “Yeah, we were and he didn’t deserve it at all.” I said softly and could see the surprise on Todd’s face.“I haven’t seen him around in ages.” “He… his folks moved.” Todd said quickly, covering up at least a bit of Sean’s story, which he obviously knew. “I almost wish I could see him again to apologize.” I said, casting out a line and hoping he’d bite. “Why?” Todd asked and I smiled at him, hoping to reassure him. “He didn’t deserve what we did to him.” I said softly.“I’m sure given half a chance he’d make a good friend.” “I’ve known him since sixth grade.” Todd said softly.“We’re actually related distantly. His father’s cousin married one of my mom’s cousin or something like that.I heard he was somewhere in Southern California.” “Really?” I said with surprise. “Does he ever come back to town?” “Once in a while.” Todd said with a shrug. “You know, it’d be nice to say ‘sorry’ to him.” I said and Todd gave me an odd look. “I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but you’ve like changed a lot since school let out last winter.” Todd said in a rush again. “Yeah, I grew up, I guess.” I said with a shrug. It had the virtue of being true, in a way. “Wow.” Todd said softly. “I guess people can change.Don’t get me wrong, you’ve always seemed like you could be a nice guy, but you never gave yourself a chance, you know.” “Yeah, that sounds about right.” I agreed and his eyes widened a bit.My smile seemed to reassure him though. “So, Davey got his car?” He said to change the subject before it got more uncomfortable. “Yeah, he had to leave in a hurry though.” I said with regret, which he seemed to hear in my voice. “He’s a lot different than he was when I knew him before.” Todd said and I raised an eyebrow as an unspoken question. “I met him in eighth grade.We had the same math class, old crazy Mrs. Dent.Freshman year we still talked because we had the same math class, but he was busy hanging around the football team after school so we didn’t get together as much. Then he just flat disappeared.I heard from somewhere that he’d moved to Nevada.” “Yeah.” I said after he’d fallen silent. “You know about his dad?” Todd asked and I nodded. “Fucking sick.” “Yeah.” I agreed softly. “So he came back here after that.” “He doesn’t talk about it much.” Todd said. “Ronna’s gotten some of the story from him, but when the subject comes up, he clams up tight.” “She’s known him a long time?” I asked and Todd nodded. “They’ve known each other since the fourth grade.” Todd explained.“I guess you could say she’s known him longer than anyone else except his family. Last night, she wanted to ask him out, but he shot her down.She’s kind of mad at him.” “I can see that.” I said, hoping he’d share what he knew. “He told her that when they first moved back, he didn’t know what was going on with his dad.” Todd said sadly.“His mom just told him they were coming back to California for Thanksgiving.He missed most of that semester and had to make up work the next year at Ceres High. Ronna said he begged for a transfer to Downey and his mom worked it out somehow. Ronna thought he wanted it to try to find her again. She’s got this notion that she and Davey are meant to be together.” “Not fucking likely.” I snorted and he actually chuckled for a moment before giving me an appraising look. “You and I probably have a better chance at that.” He said very softly, barely above a whisper and this time I gave him a deep, searching look.Did he want my Davey? “Well he is a good kisser.” I said softly and Todd frowned. “Better than me?” Todd asked as if he was offended and we both burst out in laughter. “Do you really want an answer to that?” I asked him when we’d calmed down. “No, not really.” Todd said quietly, looking nervous again.“Does that freak you out?” “What, kissing guys?” I asked and he nodded. “Not really.” “Oh.” Todd said with a look of surprise. “Does that mean…are you?” “Am I what?” I asked him and he shuffled his feet nervously while hanging his head and looking at me through his red bangs. “Um…you know.” He said softly after I remained silent. “I guess you could describe me as being bi.” I said softly, knowing that twenty years from now such an admission might not have been as big a deal as it was in the here and now. Todd’s head jerked up and he looked at me with surprise as his mouth formed a small “O”. “Is that why you broke up with Marcie?” He asked. “Let’s just say I realized she wasn’t what I was looking for in life.” I answered his question with a shrug. “Rad.” He said softly. “I never thought someone like you would ever admit to liking guys like…” “Like?” I asked him and he hung his head again. “I don’t like girls.” He said very softly with blushing cheeks. “Nothing wrong with that.” I said casually and his head jerked again. This was almost fun. “I’ve never talked with anyone…” Todd said softly before swallowing nervously. “Most guys our age wouldn’t want to talk about it at all.” I said and he nodded. “Davey freaks if I even hint about stuff like this.” Todd said and I felt a surge of jealousy.He had done it with Davey! “Really?” I managed in a voice that barely shook at all.At the moment, I was very proud of that fact.Knowing Davey didn’t have the same…values that I did in this timeline was one thing, but being confronted with it was an entirely different animal. “Not that we’ve ever done anything.” Todd said quickly, noting something in the glare I was giving him without thinking about what I was doing.“Whenever he sleeps over, I’ve got an extra twin bed in my room. It use to be my brother’s before he went off to college. Still, I’ve seen the way he looks at me sometimes at night, and well, I’ve seen the way he’s looked at you this last week at school.” “The way he looks at me?” I asked with surprise, and a sudden warm feeling filled my heart.He was looking at me! “I don’t mean to upset you.” Todd said softly, mistaking the flushing of my cheeks. “I’m not upset.” I said quickly. “You like him, don’t you?” Todd asked. “Yes.” I answered simply and he smiled. “That’s like, so cool.” Todd said. “I can’t believe we’re standing here discussing it like this.I never thought…” “Life’s full of surprises.” I said with a dismissive shrug. “Dude, you know he’s pretty messed up right now, don’t you?” Todd asked.“He works a lot, and his home life ain’t too good either.Like I said, he don’t talk about it much, but we’ve figured out some of it between us.Sometimes he fights with his grandfather and shows up at my place late at night when my parents aren’t home – they go a lot during the week on business, and so he sneaks in and spends the night after he fights with his grandfather. The old man locks him out if he isn’t home by eleven, and sometimes Davey works until late at night.” “That sucks.” I said simply, not sure why Pete would do such a thing.In my timeline, him and Davey had been tight as thieves.Thanks to Sean’s medical equipment, the old man hadn’t suffered the ravages of Alzheimer’s like he had in other timelines, according to Davey. Every year they took an annual fishing trip to a lake somewhere nearby, all the way up until the old man had died in 2017, just a month after his hundredth birthday. Davey had taken him, just the two of them, fishing on Pete’s birthday, which was a week before Davey’s own birthday. This timeline sucks; I reminded myself, amazed yet again how Davey had persevered through all this and became the man I loved. “It does suck.” Todd agreed softly with my last verbal statement.“You know, Davey’s a good guy.A really good guy. He’d give the shirt off his back if you needed it, but he doesn’t like to take help, and he never asks for it either.I had to beg him to come over if he gets locked out.Jeannette caught him sleeping in his car one night and got him to admit he couldn’t go home because he was locked out.He got pissed as hell that she told Ronna, and he was pissed that Ronna told me. Their parents don’t like him much, mostly ‘cause of his father.” “It was good of you to make sure he knew he could stay with you.” I said softly and Todd smiled in appreciation of the compliment. “Yeah, well, nights when my parents get home, he can’t stay and I know he sleeps in his car then.” Todd said with a frown. “I wish I could help him more, but he wouldn’t take it if I offered.My parents, well if they knew, they wouldn’t let him stay over during the week.” “He can always stay here, you know.” I said firmly. “What about your parents?” Todd asked. “They seem to like him, and they won’t turn him away.” I said.“Although they might have some sharp words with his grandfather.” “Then he’d never risk them finding out again.” Todd shook his head. “Just… if he can’t stay at your place and is locked out, tell him to come here.” I told Todd. “I’ll make sure my parents don’t do anything to scare him off.” “You sure?” Todd asked as his watch alarm started beeping.“Shit.I have to be at work in twenty minutes.” “I’m sure, don’t worry.” I said and stood up to hold out my hand.He looked at it and smiled before shaking it. “See ya tomorrow.” He said brightly before turning and rushing to his beetle before taking off. “Who was that?” Mom asked as I stood there thinking about Davey and his problems. “A new friend.” I answered her after a pause. “Really?” Mom sounded surprised. “I don’t think you’ve made a new friend in years.” “He was here last night.” I reminded her. “His name’s Todd.” “Oh that’s right, the boy with red hair.” She said. “Are you hungry?” “I could use a snack.” I agreed, reminded yet again that my teenage body needed more food than I was use to consuming as an old man. “Is everything going alright, Brian?” Mom asked as she put down a plate of sliced cheese and fruit on the kitchen table. She also had two glasses of water, and sat down across from me as I picked up a piece of cheese. The boys had shared my love of cheese, to Davey’s horror.Even after three lifetimes, he still couldn’t stand to eat any yellow cheese like this. “Things are okay, why?” I asked with a slight frown after swallowing the sharp cheddar cheese. “Well, it’s just…you’ve been a little different lately.” Mom said softly.“Don’t get me wrong, your father and I are really happy with some of the changes, especially after that night, but we’re also a little worried.” “What are you worried about?” I asked while furrowing my eyebrows.How had Davey managed to make it through situations like this?It was so different after being an adult to have to answer to my parents again. Sure, even after Davey and I had gone off to Stanford, they’d still been my parents, but as time went by we became adult friends as well as parents and child. Now I was back to being their child again, although bordering on adulthood.To make it even more interesting I could remember what it had been like to be a parent of two seventeen-year old boys and all the heartache they put Davey and I through with their schooling, their girlfriends, and their interesting group of friends. Certainly the media had a field day with them a time or two, but at least Davey’s father had already left the Oval Office by that point so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. “I haven’t seen Trevor or Brandon over here in a while except for your birthday.” Mom said with a slight frown on her face. “The three of you have been all but inseparable since junior high.What’s going on?” “We’re having a difference of opinion.” I said sourly. “About what?” Mom asked as she nibbled on a piece of melon. “It’s over my breaking up with Marcie.” I told her and she chewed for a moment before replying. “High school can be a difficult time, Brian.” Mom said in a nice tone.“We often think we’re in love with someone and we find out we’re not. At least you broke up with her before things got too serious, right?” “Yeah.” I answered the unspoken question as well as the one that she voiced, and prayed I was right. The last thing on earth that I needed was for the ‘me’ of this timeline to have gotten that fucking bitch pregnant. “So what’s the problem with Trevor and Brandon?” Mom asked. “They don’t really understand why I don’t want to get back together with Marcie, and their girlfriends were giving them a bad time about pushing me to get back together with her.” I said in a rush and Mom shook her head. “So they’re being torn between their friendship with you and their girlfriends?” Mom asked, but in a tone that made the question rhetorical. “Kids these days.” I said with a chuckle, and worried I might have slipped a little, but she laughed and smiled at the statement. “I wouldn’t worry too much about them, Brian.” Mom assured me.“Give it some time to calm down and they’ll remember the years of friendship they’ve had with you.” “That’s what I’m thinking.” I agreed. “You know, sometimes I forget that you really are almost grown now.” She said with a fond smile that I remembered all too dearly. I’d missed her since she died, a great-grandmother as well as a grandmother and a mother. The last Christmas she’d been alive, we’d had six little kids running around the house, as well as our own two sons and their wives. “Yeah, life goes by too fast sometimes.” I agreed with her, lost in the memory of a timeline gone forever now. “Well, I’ve got homework to do, thanks for the snack.” “You’re welcome.” Mom said as I stood up and went to my room.The homework didn’t take all that long, and when I was finished, I began rummaging through the top drawers of my desk in what was becoming a regular routine. This life was similar to my original teenage years, but there was just enough difference to it that I was trying to piece together the clues of what those differences were. Stuck in the back of one of the drawers was my bank book.Dad had started it for me in my original childhood just after I’d turned thirteen, when I started getting a regular allowance of more than a few dollars. Apparently in this timeline, it had been started after Uncle Rich had died, and it looked like my parents had given me a fairly substantial allowance as well as regular payments that looked like they’d come from rent income based on the leasing out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. That hurt a bit, as I remembered my uncle who had died two years after mom, a very old man. For him to be cut down in the prime of his life by an AIDS epidemic that was much worse than anything I remembered and made me sad. It also gave me an appreciation for how much better Davey had made my world before we’d even met. Another thing I learned was that at least my father insisted that most of the money be invested into stocks. That was good because it had kept the other me from raiding the bank account for what I thought of as the “Marcie” depredations. At least he’d kept good records of all the money he’d spent on her.A diamond necklace?Diamond earrings and five hundred dollar watch?Nearly a hundred dollars every week for lunch?That might not have been a lot in 2050, but in 1986 that was a fortune! No, it was a good thing the bitch was gone from my life.The bank account was a lot leaner than it should be, but it was more than enough for my regular needs, and what was put back in stocks and other savings would be more than enough to see me through college.At least the money-pit hadn’t robbed me of a comfortable future. “Brian, it’s almost time for dinner!” Mom called out from the kitchen and I sighed before putting the bank documents back in my drawer.Things weren’t perfect, but they were a lot better than they could have been, I decided as I went to help set the table. Now, all I had to do was to secure a lasting friendship with my beloved. Chapter 6 “Are you sure about this, Brian?” Dad asked me as he looked over the paper given to me by the guidance counselor. “You’re a little more than halfway through the school year.” “It’s going to take a lot of work, but I can do it.” I assured my father who was looking at a form to approve several changes in my schedule. Two of my teachers had encouraged me to speak to my guidance counselor after the first tests towards the end of January. The conversation with the guidance counselor had been enlightening in more ways than one. I don’t think kids ever realized just how much some of the staff at school knew about what was going on, even in a school as large as Downey. Then again, I’d been fairly noticeable as a student, even in this timeline.My guidance counselor had heard that Marcie had gotten me to pick easier classes this year so I’d share more classes with her. After a discussion with several teachers, and an oral exam by two of them, I was approved for changing to college-prep courses in three subjects.It meant a lot of make-up work for me, but it would be worth it, and not only because I added another class to the number I shared with Davey, but because I would now have no classes with Marcie who was still being an absolute bitch. “What about baseball?” Dad said with a frown. “Can you do the extra work and still make practice as well as the games?” “Yes.” I said confidently and he looked at me for a long moment before signing the form.It was Friday night, and all I had to do was turn in the form on Monday morning and I’d be in my new classes.Baseball tryouts had been harder than I had expected, but then I hadn’t played baseball or softball in nearly twenty years. Still, I’d made the team, if only by the skin of my teeth. “Here you go.” Dad said with a smile as he handed the form back to me.We were sitting in the dining room where we’d just finished a round of Monopoly and Mom was now putting the game away.We’d all talked about the schedule change I wanted, and my mother had left us to finish the discussion.“If you run into problems, I expect you to talk with me about them.” “I will.” I assured him and he looked at me for a minute before nodding. “I actually believe you will now.” Dad said with a smile forming on his face.“You’ve finally got your head on straight, it seems.” “I’m trying.” I assured him. “I won’t say the obvious, but I’m glad that what happened earlier this month seems to have gotten you turned around.” Dad said. “I’ll be honest and say I was beginning to get worried about you.It wasn’t just the drinking and staying out all night, it was things like how much you were spending on her. A relationship should be about more than that, and I had thought you’d learned that from our talks.” “I don’t know what came over me.” I said with a shake of my head.“I only wish I’d realized what a leech she was earlier.” “You know it now, before it was too late.” Dad said in a comforting tone as Mom came back and sat down at the table. She had just gotten a perm today and her blond hair was practically bouncing in one of those typical hair-spray laden late-80’s hair styles.“Brian, there is something we should all talk about as a family.” “Okay.” I said softly, wondering what was going on and what it would all mean.This timeline was so different I couldn’t depend on any memories of it to guide me. “I know you’re as uncomfortable talking about your Uncle Rich as you are about your grandparents, but this sort of has to do with both of them.” Dad said and I narrowed my eyes while listening to him. The reference to Uncle Rich was obvious, and while it hurt that he’d died when he should have lived, it wasn’t something likely to set me off.What did my grandparents have to do with this? “Honey, you really shouldn’t blame yourself for their deaths.” Mom said softly, reaching out across the table towards me. I put my hand in hers and prepared to receive some bad news.My grandparents, at least on my father’s side, should be alive still, but it sounded like something had changed and they’d died.That brought tears to my eyes, but I’d already dealt with the grief over losing my kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids, but it was more for those I’d left behind in the other timeline than for news of my grandparents’ death. “Just because you wanted to spend Thanksgiving last year with Marcie’s parents doesn’t make you responsible for their dying in that crash.They chose to come out here, and it’s not your fault they died in the accident on the way down from Sacramento’s airport.No one could have known the fog would have been that bad, and they should have stopped in a hotel room instead of driving in it when it got real thick. They knew they weren’t use to driving in fog.” “It’s alright, Mom.” I said with a shaky breath and bit back a curse to be directed at Marcie and my other self from this timeline. It really wasn’t their fault, anymore than it was mine.There was no way I could have known this would happen when I reset the timelines and I certainly hadn’t caused it by going back in time. The news was sad news, but it wasn’t something I would blame myself for causing. “As you know, they left us quite a bit of money in their will.” Dad continued in a soft voice. They had been his parents after all, and part of me was amazed that there were no recriminations in his eyes. I was proud of him, the way he didn’t blame me even though he could have, and he could have allowed it to create a rift between us. This also explained some of the self-destructive behavior the other me had engaged in recently. “A few friends of your Uncle Rich have stayed in touch with your mother and I over the years, and they are starting up a new company in the Bay Area.They’ve offered to bring me in as a partner and CFO, that’s Chief Financial Officer.” “I know what a CFO is, Dad.” I said with a hint of sarcasm and he smiled gently. “It’s a good offer, and I think they have a good business model set-up.” Dad continued his explanation. “My experience in banking and the financial markets will be helpful.” “What kind of business is it?” I asked with some real interest.This was not something I remembered from the previous timeline. “It’s a marketing and public relations firm.” Dad explained.“Several of the partners have worked for other agencies and they want to form a new business together, focusing on the emerging businesses in Silicon Valley.” “Why are they approaching you?” I asked with a frown. “Your Uncle is one of the reasons.” Dad said softly with a look at Mom who smiled back at him in what was an encouraging way. “He helped a couple of them get their careers started before he got sick.Another is that I have enough venture capital to help them get off the ground, plus my financial degrees as well as my experience will help them with the banks and other lending institutions that they need for the rest of their venture capital.” “So you’re going to ask if I’m willing to move out there?” I asked, taking the information and moving to the next step. Mom’s hand tightened on mine for a moment while Dad smiled. “Actually it was to present you with a couple of options and to see if you think I should take the risk.” Dad said. “Don’t get me wrong, it is a risk.The business could fail and we could go broke over it, or it could succeed.Either way it’s going to mean a lot of work.It might be easier if we all moved to the Bay Area, but the fact is that you’ve lived all your life here and both your mother and I are loath to give up this house.” “I’d prefer not to move, even though it means a lot of commuting by you.” I said with some sympathy for my father. Sure, over the next twenty years many people would choose to live in this area and commute two hours each way to the Bay Area for work, but it was still hard. “I’ll only be working up there for two or three days a week to start with.” Dad said.“The rest of the work will be stuff I can do here from home. If it gets too bad, I’ll probably stay overnight there during the week and come back home on the weekends, but either way it does mean we’ll have to depend on you more to help your mother out around the house.” “That won’t be a problem.” I assured him and he nodded. “So you’re okay with this?” Mom asked. “I say we go for it.” I told both of them. “It’s a real opportunity.” “That it is, son.” Dad said as the phone rang and Mom got up to answer it. “It looks like from your new classes that you plan on going to college after all.” “I’d like to, yes.” I agreed and he nodded. “We’ll put enough money in a college savings account from my parent’s settlement so that you won’t have to worry about paying for college even if things go sour.” Dad assured me as Mom reentered the kitchen. “Brian, it’s Davey on the phone for you.” She said quietly and I looked over at the clock to see it was just after ten-thirty. It was a Friday night, and I was no longer grounded so it wasn’t past curfew, but it was a little late for a social call.Davey and I had gone to lunch together a few times since the day after my birthday, and he’d been at school every day, not missing any more classes, but with the start of baseball practice and his work, we hadn’t gotten together much after school. It was slightly frustrating, but I was determined to take this slow, and so far that had been working fairly well.We’d had a few good conversations when we’d gone to lunch and he had opened up a bit about his current situation at home, although most of it was about his mother’s upcoming surgery. “Thanks Mom.” I said as I got up from the table and headed to the phone in the kitchen, which was the one she’d used to pick up the call.“Davey?” “Hi.” Davey’s voice sounded stressed. Sure, he wasn’t the exact same Davey I’d known for decades, but he was close enough that I knew when he was stressed from the sound of his voice alone.“I’m sorry to call so late.” “It’s okay.” I told him quickly. “I was just talking with my parents.” “Oh, I um, sorry to interrupt.” He said nervously. “It’s just that… well I tried to call Todd but his parents are home and…” “What’s up?” I asked firmly. “I’m at work.” He said and the sounds in the background from his end suddenly made a lot of sense.“I just got off shift early and my car won’t start.I tried calling home but the line’s been busy and my grandparents don’t believe in call waiting and it’s probably my cousin or my sister, either of which means they’ll be on the phone until everyone goes to bed and like I said Todd is stuck with his parents so…” “You called me.” I finished for him and chuckled. “Dude, I’m glad you called. You want me to come pick you up?I can give you a ride home and then tomorrow we’ll go look at your car.Do you know what’s wrong with it?” “I think it’s the starter, but I’m not sure.” Davey said softly.“I’m really sorry to bug you about this, but…” “Dude, you’re a friend.” I assured him calmly. “Friends help each other out. Am I right that if it was me calling you, you’d help me out?” “Yeah, it’s just I don’t like needing the help.” Davey said sourly. “Look at from my perspective.” I encouraged him. “At least I’m getting to prove I mean it when I say we’re friends.” “You don’t need to prove that.” Davey said and I felt a blush fill my cheeks. “So where you at?” I asked him. “The McD’s on McHenry.” He said quickly. “Ouch, all the cruisers giving you a bad time?” I asked him with a chuckle and he made a non-committal noise.“Okay, I’ll be there in about twenty minutes.” “That long?” He asked with a hint of despair in his voice and then realized it might have sounded bad because he spoke up quickly. “Sorry, don’t mean it like that. It’s just my grandparents are really strict about locking the house up at eleven-thirty. If’ I’m not there by then I’ll have to find somewhere else to sleep.” “Then why don’t we not bother?” I asked quickly, although I was having mixed feelings about the offer I was about to make. “I’ll ask my parents if you can spend the night.Then we can get an earlier start with getting back to your car.” “Are you sure?” He asked with a bit of hope in his voice and I smiled even though he couldn’t see that smile. “Absolutely.” I assured him. “Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.” He said with a little more happiness in his voice.The only reason I’d been of a split mind about having him over was that I knew if I was to make it work with him I couldn’t give in to my desire for a physical relationship right now.We had to have a firm friendship first and then the sex could happen. Sure, as an old man it had been a while since I’d had sex with the Davey of the other timeline, and he wasn’t in as good physical shape as I was accustomed to seeing on my Davey, but he was still Davey and I wanted him.Could I control myself? “Mom, Dad, Davey’s car won’t start and he’s at work right now, needing a way home.” I told my parents as I reentered the dining room. “I don’t think we’ll worry about you being a little past curfew if you’re helping a friend out.” My father said with a smile and his eyes flashed approval.“It’s a good thing he felt like he could call you for help.” “I was wondering if you’d mind him spending the night?” I asked them and Mom looked at me with a frown. “Not that we would object to you having a friend over.” Mom began softly.“Lord knows you use to have Brandon or Trevor over all the time, but why now and with such short notice?” “Two reasons on that one.” I began cautiously. “First off, I told him I’d help him see what was wrong with his car, and in order to do that I’ll have to pick him up and drive him back there in the morning. It’ll be quicker if we’re both here in the morning instead of having to drive to Ceres to pick him up.” “Ceres?” Dad asked in surprise. “Why does he have to go to Ceres?” “It’s where he’s living.” I answered. “I thought he was living with his grandparents.” Mom stated. “He does, that’s where they live, in Ceres.” I explained. “Then how does he go to Downey?” Dad asked. “Shouldn’t he be going to Ceres High?” “He went there when he first moved back from Nevada.” I said carefully. I didn’t want to lie to them, but I didn’t know exactly what they might do if they knew the full truth. “He transferred to Downey last September.” “I didn’t know they’d let you do that.” Mom said. “Well, we better not keep you.” “What was your other reason for wanting him to stay the night?” Dad asked before I could make it out of the dining room. I turned back to look at him with a frown. “If he’s not home by eleven-thirty his grandfather won’t let him in the house.” I answered and Dad frowned deeply. “Brian, honey, you want me to make up a place for him on the sofa or do you mind sharing your bed?” Mom asked in a fierce tone. “I’ve been thinking that I really should clean up the mess in the guest bedroom since I’ve been doing so much with the charity that I don’t sew quite as much.If I cleaned it up, we could have that twin bed in there for your guests.” “I don’t mind sharing.” I assured her and she nodded. “You have clean sheets on your bed?” She asked me sternly. “I just put them on yesterday.” My answer met her approval. “Get going then.” She told me curtly and I smiled at my parents and their soft-hearted nature as I rushed to my bathroom. I’d been wearing a pair of jogging short and a white t-shirt for most of the evening since dinner finished and so I quickly pulled on a pair of tight 501’s and peach and white striped polo before grabbing my car keys and heading towards the front door. I could hear my parents talking about plans for cleaning up the guest bedroom and I smiled to myself at their transparency. For whatever reason, they liked and felt sorry for the Davey of this timeline, and they were planning on reaching out to him. “I’m going now!” I called out to them. “Hold on a minute.” Dad called out and I waited near the front door for him to come out of the dining room. He held out his hand stuffed with a wad of money and pressed it into mine.“Take him out for a soda or something.Just be quiet when you get back, okay?” “Thanks.” I replied and he nodded before patting me on the shoulder and walking towards the living room where Mom was turning on the television.I had tears in my eyes as I got into my car and started it up.My parents really were good people. I knew that cruising was a tradition all across the nation, but in Modesto it held a special significance as a teen ritual.During the mid-nineties, local governments began cracking down on the decades-old tradition, pretty much outlawing it in cities all across the nation.In Modesto of the mid-eighties though, the tradition immortalized in George Lucas’s American Graffiti still held strong.While the movie had been filmed elsewhere, it had been based on the filmmaker’s experiences cruising up and down McHenry Avenue in Modesto. Every year, the town celebrated the movie with a weekend celebration in June that had lasted all the way up until the year I came back in time. That meant going anywhere on McHenry, a main North/South street in central Modesto would take forever.Fortunately there were a lot of side streets that could be used to get to the McDonald’s that Davey was at, and I was there in just a little over twenty minutes. He was sitting on the hood of his Pontiac J2000 and a frown filled my face at the sight of him smoking a cigarette.Sure, he’d told me once that he’d smoked in his first timeline, and that he’d started at seventeen, but he’d also quit after his first trip back in time. As I pulled up next to him, he threw the butt on the ground and hopped off the hood.He didn’t need a lecture from me about smoking, and for now I decided to ignore that aspect of him in the here and now.There would be plenty of time to get him to quit.With the family history of cancer that he had, he didn’t need to be puffing on those things. “Hey.” He called as I reached over and unlocked the door for him.Davey got in, along with a stench of smoke and hamburger grease and threw his bag into the back seat. At least he still had the habit of fastening his seat belt as soon as he got in a car. “Sorry it took me so long.” I said instead of complaining about the cigarette smell. “No problem, I got in touch with my mother.” He said with a frown.“My damn cousin was on the phone all night talking to some loser she’s dating. She’s pissed because she wanted to go out with him but Nanny insisted she look after the baby for once.Of course as soon as it’s bedtime, Nanny will be taking the baby into her bed.Mom says it’s fine for me to stay over, but she’s worried about the car and what it’ll cost.” “Let’s worry about that tomorrow.” I said with a smile as I pulled out.“You want to stop for a bite to eat or a soda?Dad gave me some money…” “Dressed like this?” He asked as he plucked at his polyester Mickey D uniform.“Besides I stink.” “You can say that again.” I muttered, and looked askance until he started laughing. “I’d actually prefer to get a shower, if you don’t mind.” He said shyly and I nodded, pulling into the heavy cruising traffic. Right away, I realized things could be worse when I looked over at the car next to me and saw Marcie glaring at me. Well, she was really glaring at me and at Davey in the seat next to me.Davey was rambling on about what a bad day he’d had at work and how his car breaking down was just the icing on the cake, and about his worries regarding how he was going to afford a new starter while all I could do was return Marcie’s glare as traffic inched forward.She blinked first but turned around with one last spiteful glance, and her head disappeared from view.Considering she was in the car with Mark Richards, a guy from the baseball team, and the look of first surprise and then lust that crossed his face told me what she was doing. I didn’t need to see a bit of hair bob into view for a moment, or the look of fear on his face as he looked over to see me watching to know what was going on over there. I just shook my head and turned to talk to Davey, actually feeling sorry for Mark being used by the bitch. Maybe I should warn him? When we got back to the house, Mom and Dad were sitting on the couch, watching the evening news.The news show was profiling Christa McAuliffe, and I felt guilty for a moment, but there was nothing I could do about her or the Challenger at this point. I clearly remembered that being one of the things Davey had stopped from happening, and I even remembered him telling me about it being next Tuesday, but who would believe me at this point? “You boys are back early.” Mom said as we entered the living room. “Davey wanted a shower more than anything else.” I said with a smile.“Frankly, I think that was a good idea.” “Brian!” Mom chided me although she was laughing as Davey mock-punched me in the arm. “Be nice, son.” Dad said but he was smiling too. “Here, let me get you all set for a shower.” Mom said as she got up from the couch and headed off to show Davey where the towels and other stuff were located. “Here’s the money back.” I said pulling the two twenties out of my pocket and handing them back to Dad, but he waved them off. “Take him out to lunch tomorrow, or help him get his car fixed.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You sure?” I asked him and he nodded. “That kid needs a few lucky breaks in his life.” Dad said softly. “He’s my age, you know.” I reminded Dad who smiled. “Actually he’s a week older than you.” Dad reminded me. “Brian, I gave him a pair of your sweatpants and an old shirt of yours.” Mom said as she returned to the living room with Davey’s bag in her hands.“His stuff needs to be washed and he says he has work tomorrow night so he’ll need his uniform washed.I’m going to start them now.” “Thanks Mom.” I said and she nodded before heading out towards the garage with the dirty clothes. I sat down on the couch with Dad and watched the beginning of the late-night talk shows.I’d forgotten how funny Johnny Carson was in his monologue. Would he feel bad about his ‘Teacher in Space’ jokes after the Challenger exploded? “I feel much better.” Davey said as he came out of the bathroom twenty minutes later, wearing an old pair of gray sweatpants and a blue t-shirt that was a bit tight on him. He really could stand to lose about twenty pounds, and his longish hair needed a good trim, but he was still a handsome man. “Glad to hear that.” Dad said in a show of genuine affection.“If you boys want to watch television a bit, I think Brian’s mom and I are about to head to bed. Don’t stay up all night, and try to keep it quiet.” “We will.” I assured him, standing to give him a hug before he left.When Mom passed through the kitchen, she got another hug from me, and I was surprised when she hugged Davey as well. From his look, he was just as surprised. “There’s a plate of snacks on the kitchen table if you boys want some before you go to bed.” She said with a smile before heading off into the bedroom. “Hungry?” I asked Davey and he nodded shyly before following me into the kitchen.He frowned at the plate of cheese, but set right into the bowl of grapes. I got both of us glasses of milk before nibbling on the cheese. “I really appreciate this.” Davey said after a moment of silence. “I’m happy you called me.” I said honestly. “I thought Marcie was going to shoot death beams out of her eyes when she saw us.” Davey said with a little giggle and I joined him by chuckling softly. “You saw her then?” I asked. “How could I miss it when she went down on Mark?” Davey said with a leer. “God I’m glad I broke up with that slut.” I muttered and Davey laughed. “Most guys would have been happy to have a slut for a girlfriend.” Davey chortled. “I’m not.” I admitted honestly and he raised an eyebrow.Maybe this was a good time to lay some groundwork. “Why’s that?” Davey asked with real curiosity in his voice before he started blushing and looked down at the bowl of grapes. “Sorry, maybe that was a little too personal.I have this bad habit of just asking what’s on my mind.It always made my dad crazy.” “That’s okay; I can always refuse to answer a question.” I said and winked at him when he looked up at me. His shoulders had hunched up while he’d spoken, but now he relaxed a bit more and so did I.Whenever his shoulders hunched up like that, I got worried for him, and it was good to see him be more relaxed and natural.“I remember when my dad first gave me the birds and bees talk. He told me that no matter who I dated, sex should always be something special, a symbol of our commitment to each other, a lifelong commitment and not just something of the moment. Sex should be something special, shared only with the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess with Marcie, you could say I forgot that and I shouldn’t have because he was right, you know.” “Wow, all my dad told me was to never bring a nigger, spic, or gook chic home.” Davey snorted and I shook my head in disgust. President Jones would never have told his son that, but I guess the David Jones Sr. of this timeline had, and once again I missed the time I had grown up in, with the world Davey had created. “Ouch.” I said aloud and Davey nodded. “I thought he was a preacher.” “I thought he was too.” Davey said so sourly that I winced inwardly. “Davey, I hope you know that my folks and I, we don’t judge you by what your father has or has not done.” I said softly and Davey shook his head. “You’d be about the only people in the fucking county that haven’t.” He muttered with more bitterness than I could ever remember hearing from Davey before in any lifetime. “Sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you. You’ve been really cool.Why is that anyway?Is it because you feel sorry for me?” “I do feel sorry for you, yes.” I admitted and he frowned fiercely.“That’s not why I want to be your friend though.You’re a good guy, I can tell that, and you’ve been dealt a pretty fucking shitty hand by life, but none of that’s your fault.Despite all the shit you’ve been put through, you’re still a good guy. You care about your sister and your mother, and since we’ve been getting to know each other, you’ve shown you have a wicked sense of humor and make some pretty funny comments. I like that about you, and you’ve been helping me study some and that’s helped me out, and my other friends have all but abandoned me since I broke up with Marcie, but you could care less about that.” “Actually I don’t think I’d hang around you if you were still with her.” Davey said, surprising me with that comment. “That bitch – sorry but she is – she’s bad news and I don’t want to have anything to do with her or those bitches she hangs with.” “Why not?” I asked and he shrugged while plopping a grape into his mouth and chewing silently for a moment. “It’s nothing I can put my finger on, but just a feeling I get.” He answered.“It’s something to do with the way she looks at people.She looks at them like she’s measuring up what they can do for her, or give her and that’s all she cares about.Someone like that, it’s best to steer away from.” “I wish you’d been there to warn me off when I first started dating her.” I said in all honestly and he chuckled. “Sorry, I was stuck at Ceres Fucking High.” He said sourly.“Now that was a real pit-hole, let me tell you.” “At least you’re out of there now.” I reminded him and he laughed softly before stopping and looking towards the hallway leading to my parents’ room with a worried frown. “Don’t worry, the worst they’ll do is tell us to shut up and get to bed.” I assured him and he relaxed before getting a look of curiosity on his face. “Where am I going to sleep tonight?” Davey asked. “Your mom mentioned something about it being next week before they would have the guest room cleaned up.” “You can sleep in my bed, if you don’t mind.” I said with a shrug that I hoped appeared to be casual while there were butterflies in my stomach.My old mind and young body were going to war with each other all night and I’d probably not sleep at all, but at the same time it was a sweet agony that I longed for, to have him next to me again, if only for a night. “That’s fine, if you don’t mind.” He agreed and I nodded, breathing slowly so as to not look like I was sighing in relief. “I don’t.” I assured him. “What time do you want to get up in the morning?” “It should be as early as possible.” Davey said. “I really do appreciate all your help you know.I’ve got to work tomorrow night so if I can get the car fixed easily we should do it in the morning. Then I can go home and get yelled at for a bit before going to work.” “Why would they yell at you?” I asked with concern. “Oh it’s just my grandfather.” Davey said with a shake of his head.I found that the strangest of all the differences.Pete and Davey had gotten along like two peas in a pod before. What had changed so drastically. “He’s still pissed that I went over to see my dad a few times after he came back to California. That’s when he started locking me out if I got home after eleven-thirty.Every time I get home late, he thinks I’m out seeing my dad or something.” “P… Your grandfather doesn’t like your father, I take it?” I asked, almost slipping and calling his grandfather by his first name. “Yeah, Papa’s never really liked Dad and this whole mess proves that he’s always been right about Dad.” Davey said with a frown and a heavy sigh.“It doesn’t matter to him that the only reason I went over there was to confront Dad and make him admit what he did to my sister, and I actually hit him!I fucking punched him in the gut, made him double over and every thing, but no, none of that matters to Papa. Now he thinks I’m taking Dad’s side in everything every time he or Nanny start bitching about Dad. I mean, sure Dad fucked up big time and he’s really messed up all our lives, but they don’t have to fucking put him down with every damn other word out of their mouths!” “No, they don’t.” I agreed with him, hoping my parents wouldn’t react badly to the rising voice. I could hear some shuffling from the hallway, but fortunately Davey was too far gone into his grief and anger to notice.He raised his light blue eyes, tears filling them, and a long moment of silence passed between us as he searched my eyes and face for any hint of sarcasm or derision, or any other negative reaction. “I do love him still, you know.” Davey said in a voice that shook, and a part of me knew that he’d never shared this with anyone else yet, and a deep sense of honor filled me. Once, just once, my Davey had shared part of this with me, but it had been a hundred years of his lifetime since these events had happened, and the grief had been old.Here, now, it was fresh, and the wounds were still bleeding in his heart. “He’s your father.” I said softly and Davey’s eyes were latched onto mine.“Of course you love him.” “Then why don’t they see that?” Davey asked as his shoulders began to shake with suppressed sobs. “Why do they have to be so damn angry and badmouth him every chance they get?” “Maybe they’re hurt and don’t know any other way to express the hurt.” I offered and he seemed to mull over the statement. “Davey, it doesn’t justify them hurting you in the process, but it might explain why…” “It’s so fucking unfair!” Davey growled before giving in to the tears with a sniffle.His eyes were leaking the tears now and he wiped his nose with the back of a hand. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be…” “Shhh.” I said softly, moving my chair around the table towards him, and when I reached my arms out he fell into them, resting his head on my shoulder as he just sobbed.“Let it out, Davey, you can let it out here.” “It’s just so unfair.” He moaned again while his entire body shook. I looked up to see my parents standing in the doorway with looks of sorrow and approval mixed on their faces. They nodded briefly before my father put an arm around my mother, who was wearing her rose-colored nightgown, and they walked back to their room.Davey was oblivious to their presence as he cried into my shoulder for a long time. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you like this…” “Promise me you’ll return the favor if I ever need it.” I said softly as he pulled back from leaning on me.For a long time he looked deeply into my eyes before nodding. “If you ever need me, I’ll be there.” He promised fervently and I smiled. “Good, I can always use a good friend.” I said just as fervently and he actually smiled in response to me. “You about ready for bed?” “Yeah, I could use some sleep.” He said with a yawn, and we put the empty glasses of milk away before heading into my room. Davey paused hesitantly when I shut the door behind me and looked at me with a questioning expression. “Um right or left side?” “I’ll take the right.” I said, remembering how he always liked sleeping on the left.He nodded, and turned his back to me as he began to get undressed. I could see the way he sneaked a look at me as I got ready for bed, but when I climbed into bed after him, there was a good arm’s length between us.He let out a heavy sigh as he fell asleep with his back to me, but I lay awake for a long time, listening to his breathing. Part of me still missed my Davey, and our kids, but another part of me was looking forward to a new lifetime, knowing the man I had spent so many years loving was still here, deep down in this Davey Jones. Chapter 7 “Boys, you better get a move on if you want some of this food mom’s cooking!” Dad’s voice, and his fist banging on the door woke me up the next morning and I started with surprise. Sometime during the night, the arm’s length between us had disappeared, and my arms were wrapped around Davey, who had his back to me. My morning erection was sticking out the top of my underwear, and it was nestled tightly against Davey’s back, where he could probably feel it as he stirred. With flaming cheeks, I pushed myself back a bit from him, but didn’t remove my arms from around him. He was shifting now, and I wondered if I could casually move my hands down from his chest and feel his own morning erection, and part of me wanted to do that, but I knew it was not time for that yet.Still, it was nice having him in my arms. “We’re getting up, dad!” I called out and my father moved off.To my surprise, Davey started chuckling and actually leaned back against me, although he arched his back so it wouldn’t come into contact with my erection. “Good morning.” I whispered to him, and he started laughing harder.“What’s so funny?” “Oh, I don’t know.” Davey whispered and turned sideways so he could look at my face.There was a broad smile on his.“Marcie would have a coronary if she walked in now, and your dad probably would too. Thanks though.I hope it’s not too freaky for you waking up like this.I had a nightmare and the next thing I knew you were hugging me and it just…” “I’m not freaked out.” I assured him and he arched an eyebrow with a semi-familiar leer on his face. “Really, what about if I did this?” He said before leaning forward like he was going to kiss me.I pulled back and slapped his chest, causing him to push my hands away and they ended up on his belly. “Dude, what the fuck is this?” I asked, slapping his belly and he frowned before defensively pushing my hands away. “I know I need to lose weight.” He grumbled. “It’s just tough you know, working in a fucking fast food place and never really having all that much time for a real meal, and Nanny’s always pushing food at me as if that’ll make the world better and I don’t have any time for exercise.” “Bullshit.” I said firmly, sitting up enough to rest my head on my right hand while looking at him sternly. “We’ll make time.I tell you what, I usually run three times a week in the mornings. You and I will meet at the school an hour before school starts and go running.” “You want me to give up an hour of sleep?” Davey said with a startled look.“Do you know how little sleep I get as it is?I can’t even crawl into bed until after Nanny and Papa finish watching the news. Then it’s another thirty minutes before they finish locking up, setting the alarms and actually get into bed.” “I thought you couldn’t go home if it was after eleven-thirty and they’re still up?” I exclaimed in confusion and he frowned. “Nanny would try to sneak me in, but if I’m not back yet, Papa gets up five minutes early and turns on the alarm.” Davey answered. “She doesn’t know the code and he won’t tell anyone else at all, and he’s the type that would wait for the police to show up and have them haul me off.” “Sometimes I don’t get your grandfather at all.” I said, full well being able to imagine Pete doing that if he was pissed enough. “Yeah, well, enough of that.” Davey said with false cheerfulness.“Whatever your mom’s cooking sure smells good.” “I’ve got dibs on the shower.” I said with a smile as I hopped out of bed.Davey just stretched before laying back down, and I couldn’t help but smile as I noticed him pulling my pillow to him when he thought I’d left the room. Mom had delivered Davey’s clean clothes while I was in the shower and he was already dressed as I entered with nothing but a towel around my waist.He blushed before stammering out that he’d be in the dining room, and I smirked to myself. Davey was such a contradiction, fluctuating between being flirty with me and embarrassed about being caught looking at me.Since we’d probably be leaving soon after breakfast, I dressed in an old pair of jeans and equally old shirt that was only a little tight, but it did show off my chest fairly well. Davey was wearing the clothes he’d worn to school yesterday, although they were freshly cleaned by mom. “You young men mind if I go along with you?” Dad asked as we ate the pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs that mom had cooked. “I was once a fair hand with cars.” “Sure.” Davey said after looking at me for approval.If Dad wanted to help, I wasn’t going to argue.He was definitely better than me when it came to cars. “Good, after we finish here I’ll get my tools.” Dad said and Davey breathed a sigh of relief. “I was worried I might have to ask my father for help.” He said in answer to dad’s questioning look. “When I wrecked mom’s car after getting my license he had to help me fix the rear axle I bent.” “Don’t worry about that.” Dad said firmly, but there was a gentle smile on his face that seemed to encourage Davey. “I appreciate all the help you’re giving me.” Davey said politely, but the undertones in his voice showed how much he meant every word. “It’s nothing.” Mom said with a smile. “Besides, if it’s keeping Brian out of trouble, it’s all to the good.” “Hey!” I protested, but she was already laughing with dad.When breakfast was done, we headed out and dad followed us in his car after loading it with some tools. Davey kept up an easy monologue for a while, talking about a friend of his from Nevada.It was obvious he missed the place, and had been happy there.From what my Davey had told me of the place and living there the second time he’d gone back, I could understand this Davey missing the place. “What the hell?” Davey asked as we pulled into the parking lot of the McDonald’s.Like all the employees he parked near the back, and as we pulled into the spot next to his car, I could see why he was upset.Both tires on this side were flat, and more than likely the other two were as well, which we learned after getting out of the car and looking at the other side. Dad pulled up behind us, and was looking at the car with a grim expression while Davey fingered the slit edge of the rear driver’s side tire.Someone had done a good job slitting his tires, and a rage built in my gut as I took a good guess as to who was responsible. “I’m going to fucking kill her.” I said in a very loud voice while a slender, older woman in a manager’s uniform walked out of the restaurant. “Brian, watch your language!” Dad said sharply as Davey stood up and turned around.His eyes were moist, and his lower lip quivered. I wanted to wrap my arms around him and comfort him, but I knew that this was not the place or the time. “How am I going to pay for this?” Davey moaned softly.“Jenny’s psychotherapist needs to be paid and I have to make the car payment and I could barely scrounge up enough for a starter and…” “David?” The female manager asked in a worried tone.“I’m sorry David, I tried calling your house to tell you this morning when I came in but they said you were over at a friend’s.” “I… my car wouldn’t start last night and Brian picked me up.” Davey said in a weak voice. He shook his head slightly as she moved to stand next to him.“Janice, the tires were fine when I left last night.” “They were fine when the closers left.” Janice said in a worried tone.“I don’t understand why someone would do this, you’re the sweetest boy here.” “It wasn’t someone from the restaurant.” I said through gritted teeth and Davey looked up at me with a worried look. “She wouldn’t do this, would she?” He asked and his lower lip started quivering again.“Why would she do this to me?” “Why do you think Marcie did this, Brian?” Dad asked in a low, quiet tone that was still filled with fatherly command. “She saw us last night when we were pulling out of the restaurant, and she gave us both a dirty look.” I said, not wanting to get into the part about her going down on Spencer. Had she gotten him to do it?In a selfish way I hoped it had been him and not – not Trevor or Brandon. “So you think she’d take her anger out on David?” Dad said with a questioning tone.“That doesn’t make a lot of sense.” “Who is this Marcie?” Janice asked coldly. “Brian’s ex-girlfriend.” Davey said softly. “What would she have against you?” Janice asked him. “It’s not so much Davey directly as anyone she sees me with.” I explained what I thought was her reasoning. Yeah, I was calming down, but I was still pissed. While I seriously doubted Brandon or Trevor might say something to her about my interest in Davey, I was seriously regretting having ever shared that with them. “She’s a vindictive bi–woman.” “If she ever comes into my restaurant, I want you to point her out to me, you hear me David?” Janice said vehemently. “I want to throw her out on her ass and never let her back in here.” “Thanks, Janice.” Davey said with a slight chuckle that faded away as he looked back at his car.That was when I noticed that dad wasn’t by us anymore, but was at the payphone near the entrance. “It’s not a problem, David, and I want you to take the day off to get this fixed.” She said firmly and Davey started to protest. “I can’t, I’m going to need the money more now that I have to pay for all this!”He protested vehemently. “I’m paying you for the day as long as you keep your mouth shut about me being anything other than a cranky old witch, you hear me?” She said in a tone that brooked no argument. He sighed before swallowing glumly and looking at her for a long moment. “Thank you.” He said softly and she patted him on the back before heading back inside.Davey turned to look at the car again, and his shoulders started to shake again. Damn appearances to hell, I decided and stepped up beside him, putting an arm over his shoulder and pulling him in tight for a one-armed hug. “I’m supposed to be the one who helps people, not the one getting help.” Davey muttered bitterly. “This isn’t your fault.” I told him softly. “I’m sorry she did this and I want to help fix it, okay?” “I’ll figure something out.” Davey muttered. “Davey, I bear some responsibility for this.” I said firmly.“Let me pay my part, please.” “I’ve called a tow-truck.” Dad said as he approached us again. I looked up from Davey’s car to see him nodding in approval at my comforting Davey. “I’ll pay for it, Mr. B.” Davey said and a fleeting smile crossed my lips at the fond shortening of my father’s last name that he’d used in the last timeline, first as Mr. B and then as Dad B as time went by. “You’ll do no such thing.” Dad said in a voice that jerked Davey’s head up. “But it’s my car and…” Davey started to protest and Dad held up a hand to stop him from going any further. “David, I’m going to ask you a few questions and I want you to answer them honestly, okay?” Dad asked in a softer tone. “If, after I’m done asking them, you still don’t want my help that will be that, okay?” “Okay.” Davey said sullenly. “What do you do with most of your paycheck?” Dad asked, already knowing the answer. “Most of it goes to help Mom and Jenny.” Davey answered. “I make my car payments, insurance, gas and all that with the rest.” “You’ve told me that before, so it was just a warm-up.” Dad said.“Now, here’s the important question, if you have to pay for tires and the repairs to your car, how is that going to affect the rest of your family?” “Jenny will have to miss a few sessions, and she’s just starting to make real progress.” Davey said with a frown. “I’ll end up behind on the car payments too, and since Nanny co-signed the loan she’ll have to make them up until I can pay her back and that’ll make it more difficult to stay in the city, even with your help, while mom has her surgery.” “Would you object to me helping out your sister, your mother, or your grandmother?” Dad asked and I smiled at where he was going with this.It was like he knew Davey almost as well as I did, and it was just the right argument to use. I should have thought of this first, what with how well I knew Davey’s stubborn pride. “No.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Then think of it as helping you help them.” Dad said gently and Davey nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Breckenridge.” He said to my father. “You’re a good young man, David.” Dad said firmly, staring into Davey’s eyes.“Don’t let life’s little challenges bow you down, and don’t refuse help freely offered with no strings attached.” “I’ll pay you back, I promise.” Davey said firmly. “How about you pay me back some other way than money?” Dad asked. “Like what?” Davey asked as a tow-truck pulled into the parking lot. “Let me think on that for a while.” Dad asked him. “I promise, we’ll work something out, but I don’t want to take needed cash away from your family.” “As long as we can work something out.” Davey said stubbornly and Dad reached out his hand for them to shake on it. As the tow-truck driver got out, I dropped my arm from around Davey’s shoulders, and he straightened up a bit as Dad went to talk to the driver. “I never should have called you for help last night.” Davey sighed softly, more to himself than to me, and I knew what he was saying.He wasn’t blaming me, he was blaming himself. “You’re right.” I said firmly and he looked up in surprise.“If you hadn’t called me you’d have not had your tires slashed.I’m sorry.” “That’s not what I meant!” Davey protested, but when he saw me smiling he stopped and started chuckling. “Okay, I get your point.” “Good, don’t forget it again.” I said as sternly as I could. “Brian you need to move your car for the driver to get David’s car on the flatbed.” Dad said to me as he finished talking with the beefy truck driver.“David, you’ve got the day off, and I’m going to head over to the garage with the tow-truck to get things started.It’s a good thing I know one that’s open today.If they can’t get it done today, Brian will drive you around to where you need to go for the weekend since he bears some obligation based on what he thinks happened. If you want to spend the night again, you’re more than welcome.I do suggest you stop by your house to let your family know you’re okay, though.” “We can do that first.” I said with a smile before Davey could protest.He took one look at my father’s face and slowly nodded his agreement. “Good, now Brian, here’s your allowance for the week, have fun with it.” Dad said, handing me another wad of cash, and I knew it wasn’t my allowance.Breaking all conventions of being a teenager, I hugged my father there in plain view of anyone driving by, and he patted me on the back before pushing me off towards my mustang. Davey stuck his hand out and my dad pulled him in for a hug too.Unlike me, Davey stayed in the hug a bit longer, soaking up the affection my father was so freely offering, and he was almost smiling when he got into the car. He’d handed Dad the keys to his car before getting into mine. “So, we’re off!” I said in high spirits, pretending not to notice how he looked back at his car with a worried look before I pulled onto McHenry and headed south towards Ceres. Davey sat quietly for most of the drive, brooding most likely about his car and I knew enough not to bother him as I turned onto J Street before heading down 9th towards Ceres.He snapped out of the brooding when I pulled onto Highway 99, which 9th Street turned into just south of the only gay dance club in Modesto. “You need to take Whitmore.” Davey said softly and I nodded.He then spoke only to give me directions, which I followed without telling him I knew where his grandparents lived.I’d been to both their houses in the last timeline, and both his mother’s parents and his father’s mother had lived in their houses until they’d died in the last timeline. They were right around the corner from each other, and I had never appreciated how rough that must have been in this timeline, when the two sides of his family blamed each other for the problems associated with Davey’s father. If I remembered it correctly, and I was certain I did, Grandma Jones blamed Davey’s mother for having Davey’s father arrested. Davey’s mother rightly blamed his father for what he’d done to Jenny.She’d pressed charges so that Jenny could get help from the state for her counseling but that had only lasted a year and now Davey was helping to make the payments for the continued counseling. Davey’s grandparents’ home was the same ugly dark green I remembered it being in this timeframe, and I recognized his mother’s RX-7 parked in front of it, plus the large brown Buick his grandmother drove, as well as the large light-brown van that was his grandfather’s. I parked in by his mother’s car, and got out with him. “You sure about having me over for the weekend?” Davey asked me.“I’ve got to work tomorrow too.” “It won’t be a problem.” I assured him. “We can work on our history project later.” “Okay.” Davey said and then he paused before the sidewalk that led up to the house.There was a frown on his face.“I should warn you, it’s barely ten in the morning and my grandmother and mother usually lounge around in their nightgowns until around noon.” “Don’t worry, I’m not going to embarrass you at school.” I assured him with a laugh, remembering a few times we’d come over here in the last timeline to find his grandmother still in her furry pink housecoat at two in the afternoon on Saturdays.He chuckled for a moment before getting his brooding look back and we headed up to the door.The fact that Davey didn’t have a key to the door wasn’t really a surprise considering his grandfather’s attitude, but I wondered how a person could call anyplace a home when he didn’t have the keys to get inside. “You’re home!” Monta Barrow, Davey’s grandmother said after Davey had rung the doorbell.Sure enough she was wearing her fuzzy pink robe.She looked slightly embarrassed when she saw me standing behind Davey. “Who is this?” “Nanny, this is my friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Davey said softly.“Brian, this is my grandmother, Monta Barrow.” “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Barrow.” I said politely and she smiled slightly. “I wish I’d known you were bringing company, Davey!” She chided him in a loving tone. “I’m just lounging here in my robe having a cup of coffee!Come in, boys. It’s nice to meet you, Brian.” The house was exactly as I remembered it being, with the kitchen immediately off to the right and a short entryway leading off to the right towards the living room and a hallway down the left leading to the bedrooms and bathrooms.Right at the end of the entryway was a big mirror running from floor to ceiling, and I was struck by how young I looked in the reflection. Every time I saw myself, I was reminded at how young I looked when just a short while ago I had looked far older than Davey’s grandmother. “Are you boys hungry?” She asked as she led us through the kitchen towards the attached dining room where Davey’s mother was sipping a cup of hot tea, wearinga black velvet robe with red piping.Her brown curly hair was slightly matted and her eyes had a pinched look to them, probably from pain, as Davey introduced us. “No thanks, Nanny, Brian’s mom made breakfast for us a few hours ago.” Davey answered his grandmother’s question. “What’s wrong with your car?” Davey’s mother said shortly, and I realized it was more from the fact that she was having trouble breathing than from anger.Davey might not have realized that from the defensive look on his face. “The starter’s gone bad on it.” Davey said, and when he said nothing about the tires, I took the hint and decided not to mention them.“It’s being fixed.” “Oh great, how are we going to afford that?” His mother moaned and I was amazed at how different she was than the self-confident, always calm and prepared woman I’d known in the last timeline. “Brian’s father is paying for it.” Davey said weakly.“He’s loaning me the money.” “The same man who is helping us with a place to stay in the city?” Nanny asked as she sat down with her cup of coffee. Davey and I both sat at the large oval table as well. “Yes, the same man.” Davey said softly. “Your father is truly a Christian man.” Nanny said to me and it was hard not to laugh.Dad hadn’t set foot inside a church in years, but I understood her sentiment. “Why would he do that?” Davey’s mom asked. “What’s in it for him?” “I’ll pay him back, it’s just a loan.” Davey said, stretching the truth just a bit, but from the way his mother relaxed slightly I got the feeling it was the right thing to say. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work in a little bit?” His mother asked him sharply, and I began to wonder at the deep differences she was showing.It was almost like she was going out of her way to find things wrong with Davey, and that worried me more than anything.Maybe it was just the pain she was in right now. “Janice gave me the day off, with pay.” Davey said defensively, his face clouding over. “I asked Davey if we could use the time to work on our history project some more.” I said, jumping into the fray when she opened her mouth to say something.It was probably going to be something scathing from the look on her face, but she looked at me with cloudy eyes, as if seeking to find something wrong with what I said. “Who is this?” A familiar gruff voice asked from the kitchen and I looked up to see Davey’s grandfather standing near the coffee pot, pouring himself a cup of coffee.He was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt and had a grumpy look on his face. “This is one of Davey’s friends.” Nanny answered in a knowing tone of voice.I stood up and took a few steps towards him with my hand held out as he looked me up and down. “My name is Brian Breckenridge, Mr. Barrow.” I said in a polite voice, shaking his hand firmly as he squeezed mine in a testing manner.He looked me in the eyes for a long moment before letting a grunt. “A sight better than that other boy Davey brought around a couple of weeks ago.” He harrumphed before releasing my hand and sitting down at the head of the table.“What’s wrong with that stupid car of yours now, Davey?” “Starter’s out, Papa.” Davey said. “You going to want my help to fix it?” He asked as if the notion was a noxious idea, but I was pretty sure I saw a glint of something deep in his eyes. “Um, Brian’s dad is having it worked on.” Davey said.“He’s loaning me the money to fix it and I’ll pay him back.” “See that you do, boy.” Papa said gruffly, and while there was a hint of disappointment in his eyes, I could see there was also a grudging respect.Was it respect because Davey had found a solution to the problem without having to get help? That would fit the Pete Barrow I’d known before. “I will, Papa.” Davey said plaintively, getting a frown from the old man. “What’s your father do, young man?” Pete asked me directly and I smiled. “He’s a manager at Union Bank in Modesto.” I answered and he frowned for a moment. “I think I know him.” Pete said with a shake of his head.“You’ve got his eyebrows if it’s him that I remember.” “You know him.” I said with a slight laugh and he nodded his head.The man always did make me a little nervous.“Have you been fishing lately?I saw your boat around the side of the house.” “It’s too damn cold right now.” He grunted. “You fish?” “A little.” I admitted honestly. “Dad and I usually try to make it up for a camping trip during the spring at least once a year.” “I’ll have to invite him the next time I go.” Pete said as if it was a burden, but I could see a little gleam in his eye. “Kind of in the way of thanking him for his helping the family.Maybe we’ll drag you two boys with us.” “I…” Davey started to try backing out from the look on his face, but my stomping on his foot stopped him cold. “That’d be nice, Mr. Barrow.” I said calmly, ignoring the glare from Davey.“I’m sure my dad would like to do that.” “Good.” He said with a nod before getting up from his seat.“You boys going to hang around here today or what?” “We’ve got a history project to work on for school, sir.” I said and he looked at me for a long moment. “You better make sure he puts some effort into it.” Pete said with a scowl.“If he wants to get into college he’s going to have to work harder at his books than he has been.” “We will.” I said while Davey scowl returned. “Good, then it’s been nice meeting you.” Pete said before taking his coffee with him into the living room where he used the patio sliding door to get into the back yard.Davey was staring at me like I was a demon or something, and his grandmother and mother were also looking at me like they’d never seen someone like me before.It was then that I realized why I’d liked Pete so much.He reminded me so much of Davey when Davey got older, although Davey was never quite as gruff. “So how long will you be gone, Davey?” His mother asked him after a long silence while everyone stared at me.It seemed that, with Pete’s approval of Davey going to study at my house, the matter was settled. “Um, I have to work early in the afternoon tomorrow and Brian’s offered to give me a ride, so I was going to ask if I could stay over at his place tonight.” Davey said softly. “What’ll you do if your car’s not fixed by Monday?” His grandmother asked.“I’ve got to take your mother to the city for a doctor’s appointment Monday, and she’s got to go for more tests here in town for most of Tuesday.” “I can either pick him up or drop him off here, or he can stay at our place until his car is fixed.” I spoke up before Davey could answer.“My parents said it was okay.They understand how tough things are right now, and that your first priority has to be getting ready for your surgery.” “That’s mighty kind of your folks.” Monta Barrow said with a smile.“Shantill’s mother is going to be staying here while I run Sandy around, so that’ll work just fine.” “You will call, won’t you, Davey?” His mother asked in a worried tone, and Davey got up to hug her tightly. “It’s only for a day or two, Mom.” Davey said softly.“Everything’s going to be fine. The doc’s going to do this surgery and you’re going to feel better than you have in years.” “I hope so.” She said softly, all the edge of anger gone from her voice as they hugged.There were tears in my eyes, and I remembered how devoted Davey had been to his mother.Despite the anger that often flared between them, they’d been close, almost as if their bickering and arguing was a glue that bound them together. “I better get some clothes.” Davey said softly, breaking the hug and looking over at me with a hint of a sarcastic smile. “Let me show you my ‘room’, Brian.” “Okay” I said while noticing the look of hurt that went across his grandmother’s face.She gave me a wan smile as I stood up and followed Davey down into the ‘family room’.It was really just a step down from the dining room.A big-screen projection television dominated the far end of the room, and we walked behind the two armchairs and around the couch where a twin bed was stuffed up against the far wall.A stereo sat on a speaker, although the large headphones attested to the fact that music was rarely ever played over the speaker.A dresser stood against the wall, and to the immediate right were the sliding doors that hid the washer and dryer.My heart went out to Davey at the total lack of privacy, since we could hear his mother and grandmother talking in quiet but urgent tones in the dining room. “Welcome to my little corner of paradise.” Davey said softly in a voice that dripped with sarcasm.He pulled out a paper bag from a corner since he’d left his duffel bag at my house, and began to open the drawers of the small dresser and pulled out some clothes.“How much should I pack?” “Enough for today and tomorrow, at least.” I said. “Your uniform’s still at the house.” “That’s right.” He said as he pulled out a couple pairs of frayed underwear, some socks with holes in them, and a pair of jeans and two shirts that had seen better days.He put them in the bag, folded the top over and smiled.“Well, I’m ready.” “Let’s head out.” I said as nicely as I could. The feelings running through me were mixed at best.Part of me felt really bad for him having to live like this, but another part of me remembered the look of hurt in his grandmother’s face and I felt bad for her.",

      "content": "“David, honey, did you say your mom was going to be at Children’s Hospital?” Mom asked after a few minutes. “Yes, in San Francisco.” Davey answered after he swallowed a bite of his food. “You’ll be going up to see her, of course.” Mom said. “Yes.” Davey answered although he frowned slightly. “I can’t miss much more school and Mom’s forbidden me from going up there during the week, but I plan on going up there all weekend long while she’s there. Nanny’s trying to find a hotel room she can afford so she’ll be up there all the time and Jenny gets to go for the day of Mom’s surgery and the day after. I wanted to go, but they’re saying I’ve missed too many days of school this year.” “Coach Cole said you’d be sent to alternative school if you missed more than one more day.” I said quickly, so my parents knew the score on that matter. Davey grimaced at me, but didn’t object. “Brian, would you object?” Dad asked and I knew right away what he was going to suggest. Without hesitating I shook my head. “Davey, has Brian told you about his apartment that he owns?” “You own an apartment?” Davey asked with surprise as he turned to look at me. “Yeah, it used to belong to my Uncle Rich.” I answered. “He left it to me when he died back in ’81.” “Oh.” Davey said with a weird look on his face. “It’s in San Francisco, and currently not occupied.” Dad said, drawing Davey’s attention back to him. “We’ve kept the furniture that was in it when Richard passed away and have rented it out to students and other people who don’t have a lot of their own furniture. Only thing is, right now there’s no one in there and the last few people who’ve applied we haven’t really liked. There’s no reason, if Brian agrees, that we couldn’t leave it vacant until your mother’s surgery and allow your grandmother to stay there, and of course you and your sister could stay there too when you go up to visit your mother on the weekends.” “That would be nice, but Nanny won’t just accept charity.” Davey said with a sigh. “Then we’ll charge her a fair rate.” Dad said with a smile. “If you want, you can tell her about it sometime this week and have her call Brenda to discuss the details.” “I’ll do that.” Davey said and paused for a moment before getting a look on his face that I knew was his ‘woops, forgot something’ look. “Um, thanks, all of you.” “You’re welcome.” Dad said with a smile and gave me a sharp look. “Brian, take notes from this guy. He sure knows how to be polite.” “Yeah, whatever.” I said with a typical teenage eye roll, although sometime soon he was going to get a big hug from me for being so generous. That seemed to end the subject of Davey’s family life for a bit, and not once had they brought up Davey’s father. While my parents began to tell the typical funny stories from my childhood, stories I blushed at like a typical teenager, I could see Davey relaxing. His shoulders weren’t hunched up anymore. He was sitting back in his chair, and a smile was on his face the entire time. I laughed as well, and listened with interest as the stories reached the point where I was older than twelve. From the stories they told after that point, it became clear that was where my life of this timeline diverted from the one I remembered. Meeting Davey along the bike path on the way to the first day of the seventh grade seemed to be the key difference. We skipped desert and headed back home, all four of us smiling as we left the restaurant. My parents seemed to genuinely like Davey, something that despite the last timeline I’d been a little nervous about. If things went well, and Davey once again ended up with me, there should be no problems with them accepting him as family. Dad already seemed protective of Davey in a way that I totally hadn’t expected. No one else had arrived by the time we got home, which wasn’t all that unexpected. We had another twenty minutes before the party was supposed to start. While Mom worked on the last little touches for the party, Dad gave Davey a tour of the house, including the old weight set in the garage. I could see the sparkle of interest in Davey’s eyes that he quickly suppressed. That encouraged me a bit, considering his current lack of physical fitness. He at least harbored a desire to work out again, and if he was given the chance, probably would. Trevor was the first to arrive, pulling up on his motorcycle. Brandon showed up not more than two minutes later, and the other three people I’d invited arrive moments later. Mom had been surprised by the modest number of people I’d invited. Apparently, last year I’d had nearly forty people over. Despite the fact that I’d told people to not bring gifts, Brandon had a small gift-wrapped package in his hands and everyone else had cards. Even Davey produced a card from somewhere. It was awkward for a few minutes as they all stood in the living room while my mom brought the cake into the dining room. Davey’s friend’s, Ronna (who was in our history class), Jeannette (the thin brown-haired girl whose braces had finally corrected her buck teeth), and the thin, red-haired boy Todd who I’d spoken to at school all stood behind Davey. Brandon and Trevor stood near me, looking at the three they didn’t really know. “Where are the girlfriends?” I asked my two friends. I’d invited their girlfriends out of politeness. “They wouldn’t come.” Trevor said sourly while looking over the two girls standing next to Davey, now talking to him quietly. “This is from Marcie.” Brandon said as he tried to hand the package over to me. I flushed with anger at that. “Take it back to her.” I said. “No, I’m not playing gofer for you two.” Brandon snarled as he threw the package down onto the couch. “You give it back to her tomorrow at school.” “Fine.” I said with a sigh as I scooped up the package and put it on the fireplace mantle. I turned to Davey’s friends then, giving up on Brandon and Trevor for the moment. “Thanks for coming.” “Thanks for inviting us.” Jeannette said with a smile that caused me to worry for a moment. “How about all of you come in the dining room?” Mom called out. “The cake’s ready.” What followed was a very uncomfortable forty minutes as they sang happy birthday to me and I blew out the candles before Dad cut the cake. My parents really saved the night by asking all sorts questions of the three people they didn’t know, and dragging both Brandon and Trevor into the discussion at different points. I was actually relieved to see Brandon and Trevor leave early. Certainly the explanations of how Ronna, Davey, Jeannette, and Todd all knew each other was a lot freer and more enjoyable. Todd had some funny stories of Davey in an eighth grade math class they’d shared. I’d never heard the story of crazy Mrs. Dent, her good guy/bad guy explanation of multiplying negative numbers, nor the funny story about sticks of Big Red gum being exchanged behind her back. Considering Todd’s red hair, I had to wonder if he’d been making passes at Davey all that time or if they’d actually done something together. That made me slightly jealous, and I debated on whether I should have invited him or not, but realized there was nothing I could do about it if something had happened. It was just as much my fault as it would be Davey’s. We had still bumped into each other, according to Ronna’s story about the first time she ever saw me, but there had been no conversation. In my timeline, I’d actually bumped into Sean, but Davey told me that the first time it had been him I’d bumped into. Still, in this time, we’d never chatted, never became friends. I’d apparently walked off without a word except for my angry exclamation at him that he’d ignored. It was almost funny how one little thing could cause such a big difference. “If you kids would like to go out and ditch the old folks, we wouldn’t mind.” Mom said after another twenty minutes had passed. That surprised me since I was supposedly still grounded, but Dad nodded his agreement. “Just be back by midnight, son.” “Thanks, Dad.” I said with a smile. They’d given me some nice gifts, new clothes and a new watch that was pretty cool. “I know just the place to go.” Ronna said with a smile as we headed out of the house. “I’ll drive.” I offered and everyone agreed. Davey sat in front while the other three piled into the back of my Mustang. Following Ronna’s directions we ended up at a deserted park near the river. After I parked the car, we all piled out and Ronna led us to some bench tables that were actually near the water. Jeannette was carrying a backpack she’d come into the house with and she produced two thermos bottles as we sat down. “What did you bring?” Davey asked with far too much excitement in his voice for my comfort. I wasn’t born yesterday, and put teenagers, dark location near a river, and thermos bottles together and I came up with some kind of alcohol. “Screwdrivers, just the way you like it, Davey dear.” Ronna said with a smile. “Cool.” Todd said with a smile. Davey was sitting next to Ronna with Jeannette on the other side and Todd was next to me on the other side of the table. Jeannette handed one thermos to me and the other to Davey. “Drink up birthday boy.” Jeannette said with a dazzling smile. “Uh, I’m driving, I shouldn’t drink.” I said softly. “Oh, c’mon, at least one sip.” Ronna said and I shrugged. One sip wouldn’t hurt. “Oh god.” I said moments later as I coughed. The shit was strong, too damn strong! “Like a touch of orange juice with your vodka, do you?” “Blame Davey.” Ronna said with a laugh as Davey handed her the thermos while I handed mine to Todd. He took a deep gulp, shook his head after swallowing the awfully strong drink and handed the thermos over to Jeannette who took a deep swig. “So what do we do now?” Todd asked. There was just enough light from the moon to see that his eyes were already starting to get glassy. Damn that shit was strong! “It’s a birthday party.” Ronna said with a smile. “How about Truth or Dare?” “Oh god, not that again.” Davey groaned after his fourth swallow of the foul concoction. “What? We haven’t done that in years!” Ronna protested with a laugh. “Yeah, last time you ended up daring me to kiss Mardi McFarland and she followed me around all eighth grade like she was convinced I was going to marry her.” Davey groaned. “She still would if you asked her out again.” Jeannette jibed with a laugh. She pulled out a silver pin and put it in the middle of the table. “Okay, here’s a pen we can use since both the thermoses are still full.” “Um, aren’t we a little old for this?” I asked, not totally sure I wanted to be doing this, especially at the rate they were drinking. Todd was halfway drunk already, and Davey looked like he had a good buzz going after his fifth drink from a thermos. “Oh, these are not going to last long at all.” Ronna said with a frown at her thermos. “You sure you don’t want more, birthday boy?” “That’s fine.” I said with a frown. “Good.” Ronna replied, taking another sip while reaching out and spinning the pen. The pointy end stopped facing me and I suppressed a groan while Ronna giggled. “Truth or dare, Brian?” “Truth.” I said, not wanting to be dared to run around the park naked, which I was sure she would have done given the look in her eyes. “Oh you’re no fun.” She moaned. “So, who really broke up with who, you or Marcie?” “She dumped me, but I wanted her to.” I answered sourly and all four of them laughed. “Your turn.” Ronna said with glee and I spun the pen. It landed on Todd. “Truth or Dare?” I asked him with resignation. He actually seemed to think about it for a moment before mumbling ‘truth’ to me. I was feeling a bit pissed and my mouth shot off before I thought about what I was asking. “So do you like Big Red ‘cause it lets you make a joke about your cock?” “Um, um, yeah.” Todd said as his face blushed a bright red and the other three at the table burst out in laughter. Davey almost fell backwards from his laughing and Todd glared at me before spinning the pin. As fate would have it, it landed on Jeannette who demanded a dare. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” Todd said immediately with a triumphant gleam in his eyes as he looked at me before taking the thermos from Davey. Jeannette squealed in happiness and leaned over the table towards me. She got her kiss, and it was a decent one on my part, although she slobbered way too much. It was nothing like kissing my Davey, who was currently sniggering at me. Jeannette’s spin landed on Ronna, and Ronna was dared to kiss me. She was definitely better than Jeannette, and quite good at using her tongue, but again she wasn’t Davey. “Dare.” Todd said with a wicked smile when Ronna’s spin landed on him. Ronna’s answering smile spelled trouble and she proved it immediately. “I dare you to kiss Brian.” She said in a wicked tone. Ronna and Davey burst out in laughter, leaning against each other while Todd looked stricken. He gulped and looked at me hesitantly while I let out a groan. “Oh come on, it’s just a game!” Ronna nearly shouted amidst her laughter. “Am I going to have to kiss everyone at this table?” I growled, setting off a fresh round of laughter. I was irritated at the childish game, but I grabbed Todd’s head with both hands and brought him in for a kiss, tongue and all. After a surprised moment, he returned the kiss, to my surprise, and he was better than either of the girls had been. I broke the kiss when I started to harden. The slacks I was wearing wouldn’t hide an erection for long. “Oh, that was priceless!” Jeannette giggled. “I wish I had a camera!” “Spin.” I growled at Todd who was licking his lips and looking at me in a way that made me uncomfortable. Had he enjoyed the kiss? His spin landed on Davey, and Davey let out a groan. “Don’t tell me, you dare me to kiss Brian.” Davey said with what I was hoping was just mock horror. Todd squeaked out a ‘you bet’ and Davey looked at me expectantly. We both leaned across the table, and my body tingled as our lips touched for the first time in this reality. Despite the smell of vodka and orange juice on his breath, it was a wonderful moment as our lips touched and our tongues sought each other’s mouth. It ended all too soon, and I sat down in a hurry when I realized I was now fully erect. “Oh god, that was just too fucking hot.” Jeannette murmured while Ronna shot me a look that could only be described as jealousy. Davey was hunched over in that now-familiar gesture that something had embarrassed him. If he was as hard as I was, which I hoped, then I could understand his posture. He took a very long gulp from a thermos before spinning the pen, which landed on Jeannette, who was now looking thoughtful. “Truth.” She said, changing the tempo of the game. At that moment I was very thankful for that. “Have you ever gone all the way with a guy?” Davey asked her and she blushed. “Yes.” She answered and quickly spun the pen again. It landed on Ronna and Jeannette smiled quickly when Ronna took a dare. “Ronna, I dare you to go for a walk with Davey for at least ten minutes.” “That’s easy.” Ronna said as she got to her feet, only slightly unsteady, and pulled Davey up before taking his arm and walking off towards some trees. “Oh thank God.” Jeannette said as she swallowed some more alcohol. “That was the whole purpose of that game. Sorry you had to kiss two guys on your birthday, Brian.” “Don’t worry.” I said with a shrug. “What do you mean that was the whole purpose?” “Oh, it’s just that Ronna’s been interested in Davey for years and she’s finally gotten the nerve up to tell him.” Jeannette said. She was slurring her words slightly, and Todd was taking another long pull from the other thermos. “She’s going to tell him she likes him and ask him to go out with her. I think she’s hoping to get some action while she’s out there, too.” “Oh.” I said with shock, not sure how to react. Yeah, Davey was gay, but he could still choose to date her and pretend. It wasn’t like he was out or anything. Only a hand on my thigh broke that jealous thought and suddenly I was faced with another problem. The hand could only be Todd’s, and when I didn’t react immediately, his hand slid further up my thigh until it was cupped over my erection. Jeannette had turned her back to us and was watching the river that glinted with reflected moonlight. It was all to surreal for me, as Todd squeezed my erection and I sideways glance revealed a smile on his face. His red hair was longish, and curled around the edges of his pale neck in a way that was suddenly very attractive. Part of me knew it was my seventeen-year old hormones talking, but with Davey off in the trees with a girl he’d known for years and years, and showing no real interest in me beyond friendship, it was almost tempting. Almost, but not quite. I reached down with my hand and gently pulled his off of my crotch. He frowned, and started to look worried, but the soft smile on my face, a squeeze of his hand and a wink put him at ease as I placed his hand on his own leg instead of mine. He let out a sigh as I turned to ask Jeannette a question. The rustling of trees in the distance interrupted me, though, and Davey stomped back over to the table, an angry look on his face. Ronna followed a few seconds later, looking both angry and hurt while Jeannette started to mutter a few curses. There was a tense moment at the table until Davey spoke. “We have school in the morning.” He said in a tight voice. “Brian, you mind dropping us off?” “Sure.” I said flatly, wanting to ask what exactly had happened, but I was also relieved that I knew at least one thing. Davey had not reacted well to whatever Ronna said. It was weird dropping the girls off because Jeannette lived so near the house that I’d always thought of as being Davey’s home. It was empty in this timeline, and my eyes misted over at the thought of all that I had lost from the last timeline. Then again, I’d been an old man there, and my days with Davey Jones had been coming to an end. In a few years we’d both have been dead, and now there was the possibility of another lifetime with him, no matter the troubles that we faced now. “Todd’s house is just a few blocks away.” Davey said and gave me directions. When I pulled up in front of it, he got out with Todd. “Happy birthday, Brian.” Todd said softly. “I had a good time.” “Thanks Todd.” I replied with a genuine smile. “I was glad you could be there.” “Thanks again, Brian.” Davey said as he shut the door and leaned in from the outside. That confused me. I’d planned to have him stay the night since he couldn’t drive with as much alcohol as he’d consumed. “We can get a ride with Todd’s mother in the morning. Would you mind giving me a lift back to your house in the afternoon so I can pick up my car?” “Uh, sure.” I said softly and he smiled before turning to follow Todd in the house. They were inside the nice home for several minutes before I pulled away from the curb. The memory of Todd’s hand on my erection was all too recent and played a major role in my dark thoughts of what would be happening in that house tonight. I knew Davey had no problem with sleeping around in this timeline, and I knew Todd at least played for our team a little bit, and that combination had me imagining the familiar body of Davey’s locked in wild passionate sex with the cute red-head instead of with me, the way he should have been. By the time I got home and inside, the tears in my eyes were more than enough to obscure my vision. Fortunately the parents were in bed, so I could escape to the safety of my bedroom, throw myself down onto my bed and cry myself to sleep over should-have-beens. Chapter 5 “Hey.” I greeted Davey as he sat down in history class.He just mumbled a response, and I was torn between my jealous feelings and sympathy. His eyes were bloodshot, and he was wearing the clothes I’d loaned him for dinner last night.Ronna shuffled in a few moments later, also with bloodshot eyes I noticed as she glared at Davey before sitting on the other side of the room. Davey didn’t even notice her glare, as he was hunched over his desk and fiddling with a notebook. “You doing okay?” I asked Davey quietly after we’d sat there in silence. “Just hung over.” He mumbled. “We didn’t ruin your birthday, did we?” “No.” I lied. “Good.” He replied as the bell rang and Mr. Wansor began the class.He looked disappointed that today there was very little discussion despite his best efforts. I, for one, didn’t feel like adding anything of my own because I was still seething over last night, and Davey going to Todd’s instead of coming home with me. Part of me wanted to be fair, I hadn’t invited Davey to spend the night, but still, him and Todd being together had me riled up. I ate lunch alone that day, being unable to find Davey.Brandon and Trevor left campus with their girlfriends and Marcie, who was now hanging off the arm of Jim McDonald, another player on the football team. Ronna and Jeannette ignored me in the cafeteria, and Todd was sitting with a bunch of friends.So far, my efforts to find out what had happened to Sean were having no results at all. Only a few of those I spoke to barely remembered him at all.It was almost like he’d disappeared off the face of the earth. P.E. got off to a bad start before I’d even changed into my workout gear.Today was a weight-training day, and I was looking forward to it a lot. Working out with weights had always been a stress reliever for me, and the state of my weight equipment in the garage at home told me that I’d gotten out of the habit of using it in the last year. “Yo, Breckenridge.” Reggie’s voice rang out in the locker room.It was a big room, but all of the football team had lockers near each other and Reggie’s was a few feet down from mine.He’d called out just as I was putting my jock strap on. “What?” I practically snarled and he grinned so that his white teeth shone like beacons in his dark face. “I hear Marcie wasn’t happy because you couldn’t satisfy her with your stump of a dick.” He teased, garnering laughs from those nearby.Brandon was sniggering along with the rest of them while Trevor limited himself to a snarky grin. “Man, you should know better than to listen to that bitch’s lies.” I snorted as my mind raced for a comeback. I was just too pissed off by now to be nice. “That cunt was so damn wide open she could fit the entire football team in there at once without feeling a damn thing.” “No shit.” Reggie said with a salacious grin while several people laughed openly at that comment. “Hell, I thought you knew that.” I continued, emboldened by the fact that people were now laughing with me and not at me. “I heard she could never learn to keep her damn legs shut.That’s why I had to dump her, you know.There’s no telling what’s been in her cunt, and I don’t want to catch some nasty disease from her skanky ass.” “Oh man, she’s not going to like that.” Brandon murmured from nearby as everyone laughed. “Who cares?” I responded back angrily as I pulled on some sweat pants.Davey was doing well, not having missed any classes this week, but he milled around as everyone filed into the weight room.Something in me snapped at that point, and I realized that my jealousy was being irrational.My Davey had explained something about himself at this age, in this timeline, and I had to remember that. It was the reason why I hadn’t tripped him into my bed already.The Davey of this timeline pushed away everyone he just had sex with, and I’d seen that when he just blew by Todd in the hallway this morning.If I wanted to not only get Davey into my bed, but keep him there forever, I had to make sure we were close friends first, and make sure that when he did find his way into my bed, that we’d talked about it beforehand, and that he’d opened his mind to being gay and accepted that a relationship between two men was possible.Right now, he believed being gay was a sickness, something to be hidden, and that it was impossible for two men to have a relationship. “You ready for some weights, buddy?” I asked as I came up to Davey and slipped my arm around his shoulder. He stiffened at the touch, but nodded hesitantly before allowing me to lead him into the weight room.What followed was probably the best part of the day, with me taking the time to show him how to correctly use the weight machines. I made sure to talk softly, so it wouldn’t be obvious that he didn’t really know what he was doing, and we spent most of the entire hour in a semi-comfortable almost-silence.We didn’t talk about anything other than our working out, but it seemed to heal the rift that had been between us earlier in the day. On my part, there was just something about being in his presence that soothed me.Even if we weren’t sharing the deepest secrets of our hearts, or for that matter even talking about the weather, at least I was in the room with him and we were interacting.Nor did I miss the way he stared at my crotch as I spotted him on the bench press. He was wearing an old, ragged pair of gray sweats that showed me enough of his reaction that I had to smile for the rest of the class period. No, neither of us was fully hard, but there was some excitement there.Fortunately, no one else was paying much attention to us as we finished our workout and headed into the locker room for showers.As we passed Coach Cole, I noticed the approving nod he gave me, and the very tight smile on his face. “Thanks.” Davey said twenty minutes later as he got out of my car.We were at my place, and he was heading for his car before I’d even turned off the ignition of the mustang. “Hey, you want to come inside?” I asked him and he shook his head. “I’ve got to run by all three restaurants and pick up my paychecks, sign them and get them to Nanny before I change and go to work at the McHenry Avenue one.” Davey said quickly.“Thanks though, I’ll see you in school, tomorrow, right?” “Yep.” I assured him and he smiled again before getting into his car.I stood there and waved as he drove off, not sure if I should have done something to keep him around longer.Damn it all, this was so damn frustrating! How had he done this, navigated the course of what to allow to happen, when to interfere, and all that crap?As unprepared as he was that first time Davey went back in time, he was better prepared in many ways than I was now. He knew the timeline he was changing, I did not. David Jones Sr. was supposed to be on track for becoming President of the United States. Instead he was a convicted child molester who couldn’t get elected as a dogcatcher at this point.Brandon and Trevor were supposed to be our best friends, and instead they frowned about the time I spent with Davey and stayed with girlfriends neither of them really cared about.As for Sean, subtle inquiries by me had not produced even a cold trail. I’d even looked in the phone book for his family and found nothing. He’d told me not to bother looking him up, but he was a friend, or at least he had been a friend in the other timeline. “Brian, honey, you okay?” Mom’s voice from the doorway reminded me I was standing on the edge of our driveway, staring at the spot where Davey’s car had been. “Sorry, just thinking.” I said as I walked up the driveway and gave her a hug.That was one good thing about this timeline; I could still hug my parents. “How was school today?” She asked as she followed me inside the house. “Frustrating.” I answered honestly and got a weird look from her. “That’s a new answer.” She said with a slight smile. “What was so frustrating?” “Just about everything.” I answered honestly, knowing it was a cryptic response and not sure how much could be shared with her without setting off alarm bells.She took that in stride though. “Would you like something to snack on?” She asked. “No thanks, I’ve got to get started on homework.” I replied. “Okay, just let me know.” She said. “I’m working with the foundation on our next fundraiser, so I’ll be in the office.” “Okay.” I replied, not sure exactly what she was talking about.This was part of my problem. As familiar as things were, I still felt like I was living in someone else’s life at times. This wasn’t the past I remembered, and I missed what I remembered.Everything was just too different! The homework was too easy, I realized about an hour later.With a sigh, I put the last of it away and changed into a pair of sweats and a white t-shirt. Maybe I could use the weight set in the garage and work off some of the tension I was feeling. Ten minutes later, as I looked at my weight set, I let out a long sigh.From what I was seeing, it hadn’t been used in at least a year. That gave me a useful task after I opened the garage door for more light and some fresh air.The first job was to get all the dust off the equipment and check to make sure everything was still in useable condition. Twenty minutes later, I was relieved that nothing was irreparably damaged.That was when the sound of a Volkswagen Beetle reached the garage, and a minute later a semi-decrepit 1970’s era lime-green Beetle pulled up in front of the house. A pair of fuzzy dice were even visible hanging from the rear view mirror, and as Todd got out, I found I was smiling. “Hi.” Todd said as he walked up the driveway. He looked a little uncomfortable, as if he wasn’t sure of the reception he’d get, but he did have a half-smile on his face. “Heya Todd.” I replied while being sure to smile. The red-haired guy returned the smile and seemed to relax just a bit.“You look pretty good compared to Davey and Ronna.” “I went home and took a nap after school.” He replied with a slightly wider smile. “So what brings you here?” I asked as I stood up from dusting off a set of fifty-pound weights. “I, uh, I was just in the area.” Todd said with a shrug and an uncomfortable look that said otherwise. “Did you enjoy your birthday?” “It was nice.” I said noncommittally. He put his hands in his jean pockets and lowered his head a bit, looking at me through his reddish bangs. “I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable last night.” He said in a breathy voice, with the words tumbling out one after the other. “I swear I don’t know what happened. All that alcohol and those stupid dares…” “Don’t sweat it.” I said with a shrug. What followed was one of those uncomfortable silences that happen from time to time. From the way Todd kept looking around, and returning to me over and over again, I knew he wanted to say something more about the previous night, but he was scared. “I, um, uh, about last night, you know, um, you won’t say anything, right?” Todd managed to stammer out and I almost laughed, but quickly suppressed the smile that was starting to form on my face. “Like I’m going to tell people I kissed you and Davey?” I said with a snort and he seemed to relax slightly. “Sorry, I was just, um, well you know.” Todd said with a shrug as he blushed. “Know what?” I asked with real curiosity. “I mean, I’m not going to end up stuffed in a garbage can or anything, right?” Todd said in a rush. “When was the last time I’ve done that?” I asked rhetorically, but an old memory surfaced, and I could feel the blood draining from my face. “Well, do you remember Sean in freshman year?” Todd said with a little bit of fire appearing in his voice.It disappeared quickly as he looked at me with a little bit of fear and I started to feel ashamed. I wasn’t the Brian that had done that.In my own time, someone like Todd would never have been afraid of me, but this wasn’t my timeline was it? Still, the mention of Sean, and the hint of familiarity in his voice gave me a bit of hope. “I remember him.” I said with a frown, pulling up that memory of a conversation between Sean and Davey that we had witnessed. I hadn’t thought about it for decades, but it was crystal clear in my mind’s eye now. “He…” “You guys were kind of mean to him.” Todd finished when I paused.He looked at me sideways, as if afraid of my reaction. “Yeah, we were and he didn’t deserve it at all.” I said softly and could see the surprise on Todd’s face.“I haven’t seen him around in ages.” “He… his folks moved.” Todd said quickly, covering up at least a bit of Sean’s story, which he obviously knew. “I almost wish I could see him again to apologize.” I said, casting out a line and hoping he’d bite. “Why?” Todd asked and I smiled at him, hoping to reassure him. “He didn’t deserve what we did to him.” I said softly.“I’m sure given half a chance he’d make a good friend.” “I’ve known him since sixth grade.” Todd said softly.“We’re actually related distantly. His father’s cousin married one of my mom’s cousin or something like that.I heard he was somewhere in Southern California.” “Really?” I said with surprise. “Does he ever come back to town?” “Once in a while.” Todd said with a shrug. “You know, it’d be nice to say ‘sorry’ to him.” I said and Todd gave me an odd look. “I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but you’ve like changed a lot since school let out last winter.” Todd said in a rush again. “Yeah, I grew up, I guess.” I said with a shrug. It had the virtue of being true, in a way. “Wow.” Todd said softly. “I guess people can change.Don’t get me wrong, you’ve always seemed like you could be a nice guy, but you never gave yourself a chance, you know.” “Yeah, that sounds about right.” I agreed and his eyes widened a bit.My smile seemed to reassure him though. “So, Davey got his car?” He said to change the subject before it got more uncomfortable. “Yeah, he had to leave in a hurry though.” I said with regret, which he seemed to hear in my voice. “He’s a lot different than he was when I knew him before.” Todd said and I raised an eyebrow as an unspoken question. “I met him in eighth grade.We had the same math class, old crazy Mrs. Dent.Freshman year we still talked because we had the same math class, but he was busy hanging around the football team after school so we didn’t get together as much. Then he just flat disappeared.I heard from somewhere that he’d moved to Nevada.” “Yeah.” I said after he’d fallen silent. “You know about his dad?” Todd asked and I nodded. “Fucking sick.” “Yeah.” I agreed softly. “So he came back here after that.” “He doesn’t talk about it much.” Todd said. “Ronna’s gotten some of the story from him, but when the subject comes up, he clams up tight.” “She’s known him a long time?” I asked and Todd nodded. “They’ve known each other since the fourth grade.” Todd explained.“I guess you could say she’s known him longer than anyone else except his family. Last night, she wanted to ask him out, but he shot her down.She’s kind of mad at him.” “I can see that.” I said, hoping he’d share what he knew. “He told her that when they first moved back, he didn’t know what was going on with his dad.” Todd said sadly.“His mom just told him they were coming back to California for Thanksgiving.He missed most of that semester and had to make up work the next year at Ceres High. Ronna said he begged for a transfer to Downey and his mom worked it out somehow. Ronna thought he wanted it to try to find her again. She’s got this notion that she and Davey are meant to be together.” “Not fucking likely.” I snorted and he actually chuckled for a moment before giving me an appraising look. “You and I probably have a better chance at that.” He said very softly, barely above a whisper and this time I gave him a deep, searching look.Did he want my Davey? “Well he is a good kisser.” I said softly and Todd frowned. “Better than me?” Todd asked as if he was offended and we both burst out in laughter. “Do you really want an answer to that?” I asked him when we’d calmed down. “No, not really.” Todd said quietly, looking nervous again.“Does that freak you out?” “What, kissing guys?” I asked and he nodded. “Not really.” “Oh.” Todd said with a look of surprise. “Does that mean…are you?” “Am I what?” I asked him and he shuffled his feet nervously while hanging his head and looking at me through his red bangs. “Um…you know.” He said softly after I remained silent. “I guess you could describe me as being bi.” I said softly, knowing that twenty years from now such an admission might not have been as big a deal as it was in the here and now. Todd’s head jerked up and he looked at me with surprise as his mouth formed a small “O”. “Is that why you broke up with Marcie?” He asked. “Let’s just say I realized she wasn’t what I was looking for in life.” I answered his question with a shrug. “Rad.” He said softly. “I never thought someone like you would ever admit to liking guys like…” “Like?” I asked him and he hung his head again. “I don’t like girls.” He said very softly with blushing cheeks. “Nothing wrong with that.” I said casually and his head jerked again. This was almost fun. “I’ve never talked with anyone…” Todd said softly before swallowing nervously. “Most guys our age wouldn’t want to talk about it at all.” I said and he nodded. “Davey freaks if I even hint about stuff like this.” Todd said and I felt a surge of jealousy.He had done it with Davey! “Really?” I managed in a voice that barely shook at all.At the moment, I was very proud of that fact.Knowing Davey didn’t have the same…values that I did in this timeline was one thing, but being confronted with it was an entirely different animal. “Not that we’ve ever done anything.” Todd said quickly, noting something in the glare I was giving him without thinking about what I was doing.“Whenever he sleeps over, I’ve got an extra twin bed in my room. It use to be my brother’s before he went off to college. Still, I’ve seen the way he looks at me sometimes at night, and well, I’ve seen the way he’s looked at you this last week at school.” “The way he looks at me?” I asked with surprise, and a sudden warm feeling filled my heart.He was looking at me! “I don’t mean to upset you.” Todd said softly, mistaking the flushing of my cheeks. “I’m not upset.” I said quickly. “You like him, don’t you?” Todd asked. “Yes.” I answered simply and he smiled. “That’s like, so cool.” Todd said. “I can’t believe we’re standing here discussing it like this.I never thought…” “Life’s full of surprises.” I said with a dismissive shrug. “Dude, you know he’s pretty messed up right now, don’t you?” Todd asked.“He works a lot, and his home life ain’t too good either.Like I said, he don’t talk about it much, but we’ve figured out some of it between us.Sometimes he fights with his grandfather and shows up at my place late at night when my parents aren’t home – they go a lot during the week on business, and so he sneaks in and spends the night after he fights with his grandfather. The old man locks him out if he isn’t home by eleven, and sometimes Davey works until late at night.” “That sucks.” I said simply, not sure why Pete would do such a thing.In my timeline, him and Davey had been tight as thieves.Thanks to Sean’s medical equipment, the old man hadn’t suffered the ravages of Alzheimer’s like he had in other timelines, according to Davey. Every year they took an annual fishing trip to a lake somewhere nearby, all the way up until the old man had died in 2017, just a month after his hundredth birthday. Davey had taken him, just the two of them, fishing on Pete’s birthday, which was a week before Davey’s own birthday. This timeline sucks; I reminded myself, amazed yet again how Davey had persevered through all this and became the man I loved. “It does suck.” Todd agreed softly with my last verbal statement.“You know, Davey’s a good guy.A really good guy. He’d give the shirt off his back if you needed it, but he doesn’t like to take help, and he never asks for it either.I had to beg him to come over if he gets locked out.Jeannette caught him sleeping in his car one night and got him to admit he couldn’t go home because he was locked out.He got pissed as hell that she told Ronna, and he was pissed that Ronna told me. Their parents don’t like him much, mostly ‘cause of his father.” “It was good of you to make sure he knew he could stay with you.” I said softly and Todd smiled in appreciation of the compliment. “Yeah, well, nights when my parents get home, he can’t stay and I know he sleeps in his car then.” Todd said with a frown. “I wish I could help him more, but he wouldn’t take it if I offered.My parents, well if they knew, they wouldn’t let him stay over during the week.” “He can always stay here, you know.” I said firmly. “What about your parents?” Todd asked. “They seem to like him, and they won’t turn him away.” I said.“Although they might have some sharp words with his grandfather.” “Then he’d never risk them finding out again.” Todd shook his head. “Just… if he can’t stay at your place and is locked out, tell him to come here.” I told Todd. “I’ll make sure my parents don’t do anything to scare him off.” “You sure?” Todd asked as his watch alarm started beeping.“Shit.I have to be at work in twenty minutes.” “I’m sure, don’t worry.” I said and stood up to hold out my hand.He looked at it and smiled before shaking it. “See ya tomorrow.” He said brightly before turning and rushing to his beetle before taking off. “Who was that?” Mom asked as I stood there thinking about Davey and his problems. “A new friend.” I answered her after a pause. “Really?” Mom sounded surprised. “I don’t think you’ve made a new friend in years.” “He was here last night.” I reminded her. “His name’s Todd.” “Oh that’s right, the boy with red hair.” She said. “Are you hungry?” “I could use a snack.” I agreed, reminded yet again that my teenage body needed more food than I was use to consuming as an old man. “Is everything going alright, Brian?” Mom asked as she put down a plate of sliced cheese and fruit on the kitchen table. She also had two glasses of water, and sat down across from me as I picked up a piece of cheese. The boys had shared my love of cheese, to Davey’s horror.Even after three lifetimes, he still couldn’t stand to eat any yellow cheese like this. “Things are okay, why?” I asked with a slight frown after swallowing the sharp cheddar cheese. “Well, it’s just…you’ve been a little different lately.” Mom said softly.“Don’t get me wrong, your father and I are really happy with some of the changes, especially after that night, but we’re also a little worried.” “What are you worried about?” I asked while furrowing my eyebrows.How had Davey managed to make it through situations like this?It was so different after being an adult to have to answer to my parents again. Sure, even after Davey and I had gone off to Stanford, they’d still been my parents, but as time went by we became adult friends as well as parents and child. Now I was back to being their child again, although bordering on adulthood.To make it even more interesting I could remember what it had been like to be a parent of two seventeen-year old boys and all the heartache they put Davey and I through with their schooling, their girlfriends, and their interesting group of friends. Certainly the media had a field day with them a time or two, but at least Davey’s father had already left the Oval Office by that point so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. “I haven’t seen Trevor or Brandon over here in a while except for your birthday.” Mom said with a slight frown on her face. “The three of you have been all but inseparable since junior high.What’s going on?” “We’re having a difference of opinion.” I said sourly. “About what?” Mom asked as she nibbled on a piece of melon. “It’s over my breaking up with Marcie.” I told her and she chewed for a moment before replying. “High school can be a difficult time, Brian.” Mom said in a nice tone.“We often think we’re in love with someone and we find out we’re not. At least you broke up with her before things got too serious, right?” “Yeah.” I answered the unspoken question as well as the one that she voiced, and prayed I was right. The last thing on earth that I needed was for the ‘me’ of this timeline to have gotten that fucking bitch pregnant. “So what’s the problem with Trevor and Brandon?” Mom asked. “They don’t really understand why I don’t want to get back together with Marcie, and their girlfriends were giving them a bad time about pushing me to get back together with her.” I said in a rush and Mom shook her head. “So they’re being torn between their friendship with you and their girlfriends?” Mom asked, but in a tone that made the question rhetorical. “Kids these days.” I said with a chuckle, and worried I might have slipped a little, but she laughed and smiled at the statement. “I wouldn’t worry too much about them, Brian.” Mom assured me.“Give it some time to calm down and they’ll remember the years of friendship they’ve had with you.” “That’s what I’m thinking.” I agreed. “You know, sometimes I forget that you really are almost grown now.” She said with a fond smile that I remembered all too dearly. I’d missed her since she died, a great-grandmother as well as a grandmother and a mother. The last Christmas she’d been alive, we’d had six little kids running around the house, as well as our own two sons and their wives. “Yeah, life goes by too fast sometimes.” I agreed with her, lost in the memory of a timeline gone forever now. “Well, I’ve got homework to do, thanks for the snack.” “You’re welcome.” Mom said as I stood up and went to my room.The homework didn’t take all that long, and when I was finished, I began rummaging through the top drawers of my desk in what was becoming a regular routine. This life was similar to my original teenage years, but there was just enough difference to it that I was trying to piece together the clues of what those differences were. Stuck in the back of one of the drawers was my bank book.Dad had started it for me in my original childhood just after I’d turned thirteen, when I started getting a regular allowance of more than a few dollars. Apparently in this timeline, it had been started after Uncle Rich had died, and it looked like my parents had given me a fairly substantial allowance as well as regular payments that looked like they’d come from rent income based on the leasing out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. That hurt a bit, as I remembered my uncle who had died two years after mom, a very old man. For him to be cut down in the prime of his life by an AIDS epidemic that was much worse than anything I remembered and made me sad. It also gave me an appreciation for how much better Davey had made my world before we’d even met. Another thing I learned was that at least my father insisted that most of the money be invested into stocks. That was good because it had kept the other me from raiding the bank account for what I thought of as the “Marcie” depredations. At least he’d kept good records of all the money he’d spent on her.A diamond necklace?Diamond earrings and five hundred dollar watch?Nearly a hundred dollars every week for lunch?That might not have been a lot in 2050, but in 1986 that was a fortune! No, it was a good thing the bitch was gone from my life.The bank account was a lot leaner than it should be, but it was more than enough for my regular needs, and what was put back in stocks and other savings would be more than enough to see me through college.At least the money-pit hadn’t robbed me of a comfortable future. “Brian, it’s almost time for dinner!” Mom called out from the kitchen and I sighed before putting the bank documents back in my drawer.Things weren’t perfect, but they were a lot better than they could have been, I decided as I went to help set the table. Now, all I had to do was to secure a lasting friendship with my beloved. Chapter 6 “Are you sure about this, Brian?” Dad asked me as he looked over the paper given to me by the guidance counselor. “You’re a little more than halfway through the school year.” “It’s going to take a lot of work, but I can do it.” I assured my father who was looking at a form to approve several changes in my schedule. Two of my teachers had encouraged me to speak to my guidance counselor after the first tests towards the end of January. The conversation with the guidance counselor had been enlightening in more ways than one. I don’t think kids ever realized just how much some of the staff at school knew about what was going on, even in a school as large as Downey. Then again, I’d been fairly noticeable as a student, even in this timeline.My guidance counselor had heard that Marcie had gotten me to pick easier classes this year so I’d share more classes with her. After a discussion with several teachers, and an oral exam by two of them, I was approved for changing to college-prep courses in three subjects.It meant a lot of make-up work for me, but it would be worth it, and not only because I added another class to the number I shared with Davey, but because I would now have no classes with Marcie who was still being an absolute bitch. “What about baseball?” Dad said with a frown. “Can you do the extra work and still make practice as well as the games?” “Yes.” I said confidently and he looked at me for a long moment before signing the form.It was Friday night, and all I had to do was turn in the form on Monday morning and I’d be in my new classes.Baseball tryouts had been harder than I had expected, but then I hadn’t played baseball or softball in nearly twenty years. Still, I’d made the team, if only by the skin of my teeth. “Here you go.” Dad said with a smile as he handed the form back to me.We were sitting in the dining room where we’d just finished a round of Monopoly and Mom was now putting the game away.We’d all talked about the schedule change I wanted, and my mother had left us to finish the discussion.“If you run into problems, I expect you to talk with me about them.” “I will.” I assured him and he looked at me for a minute before nodding. “I actually believe you will now.” Dad said with a smile forming on his face.“You’ve finally got your head on straight, it seems.” “I’m trying.” I assured him. “I won’t say the obvious, but I’m glad that what happened earlier this month seems to have gotten you turned around.” Dad said. “I’ll be honest and say I was beginning to get worried about you.It wasn’t just the drinking and staying out all night, it was things like how much you were spending on her. A relationship should be about more than that, and I had thought you’d learned that from our talks.” “I don’t know what came over me.” I said with a shake of my head.“I only wish I’d realized what a leech she was earlier.” “You know it now, before it was too late.” Dad said in a comforting tone as Mom came back and sat down at the table. She had just gotten a perm today and her blond hair was practically bouncing in one of those typical hair-spray laden late-80’s hair styles.“Brian, there is something we should all talk about as a family.” “Okay.” I said softly, wondering what was going on and what it would all mean.This timeline was so different I couldn’t depend on any memories of it to guide me. “I know you’re as uncomfortable talking about your Uncle Rich as you are about your grandparents, but this sort of has to do with both of them.” Dad said and I narrowed my eyes while listening to him. The reference to Uncle Rich was obvious, and while it hurt that he’d died when he should have lived, it wasn’t something likely to set me off.What did my grandparents have to do with this? “Honey, you really shouldn’t blame yourself for their deaths.” Mom said softly, reaching out across the table towards me. I put my hand in hers and prepared to receive some bad news.My grandparents, at least on my father’s side, should be alive still, but it sounded like something had changed and they’d died.That brought tears to my eyes, but I’d already dealt with the grief over losing my kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids, but it was more for those I’d left behind in the other timeline than for news of my grandparents’ death. “Just because you wanted to spend Thanksgiving last year with Marcie’s parents doesn’t make you responsible for their dying in that crash.They chose to come out here, and it’s not your fault they died in the accident on the way down from Sacramento’s airport.No one could have known the fog would have been that bad, and they should have stopped in a hotel room instead of driving in it when it got real thick. They knew they weren’t use to driving in fog.” “It’s alright, Mom.” I said with a shaky breath and bit back a curse to be directed at Marcie and my other self from this timeline. It really wasn’t their fault, anymore than it was mine.There was no way I could have known this would happen when I reset the timelines and I certainly hadn’t caused it by going back in time. The news was sad news, but it wasn’t something I would blame myself for causing. “As you know, they left us quite a bit of money in their will.” Dad continued in a soft voice. They had been his parents after all, and part of me was amazed that there were no recriminations in his eyes. I was proud of him, the way he didn’t blame me even though he could have, and he could have allowed it to create a rift between us. This also explained some of the self-destructive behavior the other me had engaged in recently. “A few friends of your Uncle Rich have stayed in touch with your mother and I over the years, and they are starting up a new company in the Bay Area.They’ve offered to bring me in as a partner and CFO, that’s Chief Financial Officer.” “I know what a CFO is, Dad.” I said with a hint of sarcasm and he smiled gently. “It’s a good offer, and I think they have a good business model set-up.” Dad continued his explanation. “My experience in banking and the financial markets will be helpful.” “What kind of business is it?” I asked with some real interest.This was not something I remembered from the previous timeline. “It’s a marketing and public relations firm.” Dad explained.“Several of the partners have worked for other agencies and they want to form a new business together, focusing on the emerging businesses in Silicon Valley.” “Why are they approaching you?” I asked with a frown. “Your Uncle is one of the reasons.” Dad said softly with a look at Mom who smiled back at him in what was an encouraging way. “He helped a couple of them get their careers started before he got sick.Another is that I have enough venture capital to help them get off the ground, plus my financial degrees as well as my experience will help them with the banks and other lending institutions that they need for the rest of their venture capital.” “So you’re going to ask if I’m willing to move out there?” I asked, taking the information and moving to the next step. Mom’s hand tightened on mine for a moment while Dad smiled. “Actually it was to present you with a couple of options and to see if you think I should take the risk.” Dad said. “Don’t get me wrong, it is a risk.The business could fail and we could go broke over it, or it could succeed.Either way it’s going to mean a lot of work.It might be easier if we all moved to the Bay Area, but the fact is that you’ve lived all your life here and both your mother and I are loath to give up this house.” “I’d prefer not to move, even though it means a lot of commuting by you.” I said with some sympathy for my father. Sure, over the next twenty years many people would choose to live in this area and commute two hours each way to the Bay Area for work, but it was still hard. “I’ll only be working up there for two or three days a week to start with.” Dad said.“The rest of the work will be stuff I can do here from home. If it gets too bad, I’ll probably stay overnight there during the week and come back home on the weekends, but either way it does mean we’ll have to depend on you more to help your mother out around the house.” “That won’t be a problem.” I assured him and he nodded. “So you’re okay with this?” Mom asked. “I say we go for it.” I told both of them. “It’s a real opportunity.” “That it is, son.” Dad said as the phone rang and Mom got up to answer it. “It looks like from your new classes that you plan on going to college after all.” “I’d like to, yes.” I agreed and he nodded. “We’ll put enough money in a college savings account from my parent’s settlement so that you won’t have to worry about paying for college even if things go sour.” Dad assured me as Mom reentered the kitchen. “Brian, it’s Davey on the phone for you.” She said quietly and I looked over at the clock to see it was just after ten-thirty. It was a Friday night, and I was no longer grounded so it wasn’t past curfew, but it was a little late for a social call.Davey and I had gone to lunch together a few times since the day after my birthday, and he’d been at school every day, not missing any more classes, but with the start of baseball practice and his work, we hadn’t gotten together much after school. It was slightly frustrating, but I was determined to take this slow, and so far that had been working fairly well.We’d had a few good conversations when we’d gone to lunch and he had opened up a bit about his current situation at home, although most of it was about his mother’s upcoming surgery. “Thanks Mom.” I said as I got up from the table and headed to the phone in the kitchen, which was the one she’d used to pick up the call.“Davey?” “Hi.” Davey’s voice sounded stressed. Sure, he wasn’t the exact same Davey I’d known for decades, but he was close enough that I knew when he was stressed from the sound of his voice alone.“I’m sorry to call so late.” “It’s okay.” I told him quickly. “I was just talking with my parents.” “Oh, I um, sorry to interrupt.” He said nervously. “It’s just that… well I tried to call Todd but his parents are home and…” “What’s up?” I asked firmly. “I’m at work.” He said and the sounds in the background from his end suddenly made a lot of sense.“I just got off shift early and my car won’t start.I tried calling home but the line’s been busy and my grandparents don’t believe in call waiting and it’s probably my cousin or my sister, either of which means they’ll be on the phone until everyone goes to bed and like I said Todd is stuck with his parents so…” “You called me.” I finished for him and chuckled. “Dude, I’m glad you called. You want me to come pick you up?I can give you a ride home and then tomorrow we’ll go look at your car.Do you know what’s wrong with it?” “I think it’s the starter, but I’m not sure.” Davey said softly.“I’m really sorry to bug you about this, but…” “Dude, you’re a friend.” I assured him calmly. “Friends help each other out. Am I right that if it was me calling you, you’d help me out?” “Yeah, it’s just I don’t like needing the help.” Davey said sourly. “Look at from my perspective.” I encouraged him. “At least I’m getting to prove I mean it when I say we’re friends.” “You don’t need to prove that.” Davey said and I felt a blush fill my cheeks. “So where you at?” I asked him. “The McD’s on McHenry.” He said quickly. “Ouch, all the cruisers giving you a bad time?” I asked him with a chuckle and he made a non-committal noise.“Okay, I’ll be there in about twenty minutes.” “That long?” He asked with a hint of despair in his voice and then realized it might have sounded bad because he spoke up quickly. “Sorry, don’t mean it like that. It’s just my grandparents are really strict about locking the house up at eleven-thirty. If’ I’m not there by then I’ll have to find somewhere else to sleep.” “Then why don’t we not bother?” I asked quickly, although I was having mixed feelings about the offer I was about to make. “I’ll ask my parents if you can spend the night.Then we can get an earlier start with getting back to your car.” “Are you sure?” He asked with a bit of hope in his voice and I smiled even though he couldn’t see that smile. “Absolutely.” I assured him. “Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.” He said with a little more happiness in his voice.The only reason I’d been of a split mind about having him over was that I knew if I was to make it work with him I couldn’t give in to my desire for a physical relationship right now.We had to have a firm friendship first and then the sex could happen. Sure, as an old man it had been a while since I’d had sex with the Davey of the other timeline, and he wasn’t in as good physical shape as I was accustomed to seeing on my Davey, but he was still Davey and I wanted him.Could I control myself? “Mom, Dad, Davey’s car won’t start and he’s at work right now, needing a way home.” I told my parents as I reentered the dining room. “I don’t think we’ll worry about you being a little past curfew if you’re helping a friend out.” My father said with a smile and his eyes flashed approval.“It’s a good thing he felt like he could call you for help.” “I was wondering if you’d mind him spending the night?” I asked them and Mom looked at me with a frown. “Not that we would object to you having a friend over.” Mom began softly.“Lord knows you use to have Brandon or Trevor over all the time, but why now and with such short notice?” “Two reasons on that one.” I began cautiously. “First off, I told him I’d help him see what was wrong with his car, and in order to do that I’ll have to pick him up and drive him back there in the morning. It’ll be quicker if we’re both here in the morning instead of having to drive to Ceres to pick him up.” “Ceres?” Dad asked in surprise. “Why does he have to go to Ceres?” “It’s where he’s living.” I answered. “I thought he was living with his grandparents.” Mom stated. “He does, that’s where they live, in Ceres.” I explained. “Then how does he go to Downey?” Dad asked. “Shouldn’t he be going to Ceres High?” “He went there when he first moved back from Nevada.” I said carefully. I didn’t want to lie to them, but I didn’t know exactly what they might do if they knew the full truth. “He transferred to Downey last September.” “I didn’t know they’d let you do that.” Mom said. “Well, we better not keep you.” “What was your other reason for wanting him to stay the night?” Dad asked before I could make it out of the dining room. I turned back to look at him with a frown. “If he’s not home by eleven-thirty his grandfather won’t let him in the house.” I answered and Dad frowned deeply. “Brian, honey, you want me to make up a place for him on the sofa or do you mind sharing your bed?” Mom asked in a fierce tone. “I’ve been thinking that I really should clean up the mess in the guest bedroom since I’ve been doing so much with the charity that I don’t sew quite as much.If I cleaned it up, we could have that twin bed in there for your guests.” “I don’t mind sharing.” I assured her and she nodded. “You have clean sheets on your bed?” She asked me sternly. “I just put them on yesterday.” My answer met her approval. “Get going then.” She told me curtly and I smiled at my parents and their soft-hearted nature as I rushed to my bathroom. I’d been wearing a pair of jogging short and a white t-shirt for most of the evening since dinner finished and so I quickly pulled on a pair of tight 501’s and peach and white striped polo before grabbing my car keys and heading towards the front door. I could hear my parents talking about plans for cleaning up the guest bedroom and I smiled to myself at their transparency. For whatever reason, they liked and felt sorry for the Davey of this timeline, and they were planning on reaching out to him. “I’m going now!” I called out to them. “Hold on a minute.” Dad called out and I waited near the front door for him to come out of the dining room. He held out his hand stuffed with a wad of money and pressed it into mine.“Take him out for a soda or something.Just be quiet when you get back, okay?” “Thanks.” I replied and he nodded before patting me on the shoulder and walking towards the living room where Mom was turning on the television.I had tears in my eyes as I got into my car and started it up.My parents really were good people. I knew that cruising was a tradition all across the nation, but in Modesto it held a special significance as a teen ritual.During the mid-nineties, local governments began cracking down on the decades-old tradition, pretty much outlawing it in cities all across the nation.In Modesto of the mid-eighties though, the tradition immortalized in George Lucas’s American Graffiti still held strong.While the movie had been filmed elsewhere, it had been based on the filmmaker’s experiences cruising up and down McHenry Avenue in Modesto. Every year, the town celebrated the movie with a weekend celebration in June that had lasted all the way up until the year I came back in time. That meant going anywhere on McHenry, a main North/South street in central Modesto would take forever.Fortunately there were a lot of side streets that could be used to get to the McDonald’s that Davey was at, and I was there in just a little over twenty minutes. He was sitting on the hood of his Pontiac J2000 and a frown filled my face at the sight of him smoking a cigarette.Sure, he’d told me once that he’d smoked in his first timeline, and that he’d started at seventeen, but he’d also quit after his first trip back in time. As I pulled up next to him, he threw the butt on the ground and hopped off the hood.He didn’t need a lecture from me about smoking, and for now I decided to ignore that aspect of him in the here and now.There would be plenty of time to get him to quit.With the family history of cancer that he had, he didn’t need to be puffing on those things. “Hey.” He called as I reached over and unlocked the door for him.Davey got in, along with a stench of smoke and hamburger grease and threw his bag into the back seat. At least he still had the habit of fastening his seat belt as soon as he got in a car. “Sorry it took me so long.” I said instead of complaining about the cigarette smell. “No problem, I got in touch with my mother.” He said with a frown.“My damn cousin was on the phone all night talking to some loser she’s dating. She’s pissed because she wanted to go out with him but Nanny insisted she look after the baby for once.Of course as soon as it’s bedtime, Nanny will be taking the baby into her bed.Mom says it’s fine for me to stay over, but she’s worried about the car and what it’ll cost.” “Let’s worry about that tomorrow.” I said with a smile as I pulled out.“You want to stop for a bite to eat or a soda?Dad gave me some money…” “Dressed like this?” He asked as he plucked at his polyester Mickey D uniform.“Besides I stink.” “You can say that again.” I muttered, and looked askance until he started laughing. “I’d actually prefer to get a shower, if you don’t mind.” He said shyly and I nodded, pulling into the heavy cruising traffic. Right away, I realized things could be worse when I looked over at the car next to me and saw Marcie glaring at me. Well, she was really glaring at me and at Davey in the seat next to me.Davey was rambling on about what a bad day he’d had at work and how his car breaking down was just the icing on the cake, and about his worries regarding how he was going to afford a new starter while all I could do was return Marcie’s glare as traffic inched forward.She blinked first but turned around with one last spiteful glance, and her head disappeared from view.Considering she was in the car with Mark Richards, a guy from the baseball team, and the look of first surprise and then lust that crossed his face told me what she was doing. I didn’t need to see a bit of hair bob into view for a moment, or the look of fear on his face as he looked over to see me watching to know what was going on over there. I just shook my head and turned to talk to Davey, actually feeling sorry for Mark being used by the bitch. Maybe I should warn him? When we got back to the house, Mom and Dad were sitting on the couch, watching the evening news.The news show was profiling Christa McAuliffe, and I felt guilty for a moment, but there was nothing I could do about her or the Challenger at this point. I clearly remembered that being one of the things Davey had stopped from happening, and I even remembered him telling me about it being next Tuesday, but who would believe me at this point? “You boys are back early.” Mom said as we entered the living room. “Davey wanted a shower more than anything else.” I said with a smile.“Frankly, I think that was a good idea.” “Brian!” Mom chided me although she was laughing as Davey mock-punched me in the arm. “Be nice, son.” Dad said but he was smiling too. “Here, let me get you all set for a shower.” Mom said as she got up from the couch and headed off to show Davey where the towels and other stuff were located. “Here’s the money back.” I said pulling the two twenties out of my pocket and handing them back to Dad, but he waved them off. “Take him out to lunch tomorrow, or help him get his car fixed.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You sure?” I asked him and he nodded. “That kid needs a few lucky breaks in his life.” Dad said softly. “He’s my age, you know.” I reminded Dad who smiled. “Actually he’s a week older than you.” Dad reminded me. “Brian, I gave him a pair of your sweatpants and an old shirt of yours.” Mom said as she returned to the living room with Davey’s bag in her hands.“His stuff needs to be washed and he says he has work tomorrow night so he’ll need his uniform washed.I’m going to start them now.” “Thanks Mom.” I said and she nodded before heading out towards the garage with the dirty clothes. I sat down on the couch with Dad and watched the beginning of the late-night talk shows.I’d forgotten how funny Johnny Carson was in his monologue. Would he feel bad about his ‘Teacher in Space’ jokes after the Challenger exploded? “I feel much better.” Davey said as he came out of the bathroom twenty minutes later, wearing an old pair of gray sweatpants and a blue t-shirt that was a bit tight on him. He really could stand to lose about twenty pounds, and his longish hair needed a good trim, but he was still a handsome man. “Glad to hear that.” Dad said in a show of genuine affection.“If you boys want to watch television a bit, I think Brian’s mom and I are about to head to bed. Don’t stay up all night, and try to keep it quiet.” “We will.” I assured him, standing to give him a hug before he left.When Mom passed through the kitchen, she got another hug from me, and I was surprised when she hugged Davey as well. From his look, he was just as surprised. “There’s a plate of snacks on the kitchen table if you boys want some before you go to bed.” She said with a smile before heading off into the bedroom. “Hungry?” I asked Davey and he nodded shyly before following me into the kitchen.He frowned at the plate of cheese, but set right into the bowl of grapes. I got both of us glasses of milk before nibbling on the cheese. “I really appreciate this.” Davey said after a moment of silence. “I’m happy you called me.” I said honestly. “I thought Marcie was going to shoot death beams out of her eyes when she saw us.” Davey said with a little giggle and I joined him by chuckling softly. “You saw her then?” I asked. “How could I miss it when she went down on Mark?” Davey said with a leer. “God I’m glad I broke up with that slut.” I muttered and Davey laughed. “Most guys would have been happy to have a slut for a girlfriend.” Davey chortled. “I’m not.” I admitted honestly and he raised an eyebrow.Maybe this was a good time to lay some groundwork. “Why’s that?” Davey asked with real curiosity in his voice before he started blushing and looked down at the bowl of grapes. “Sorry, maybe that was a little too personal.I have this bad habit of just asking what’s on my mind.It always made my dad crazy.” “That’s okay; I can always refuse to answer a question.” I said and winked at him when he looked up at me. His shoulders had hunched up while he’d spoken, but now he relaxed a bit more and so did I.Whenever his shoulders hunched up like that, I got worried for him, and it was good to see him be more relaxed and natural.“I remember when my dad first gave me the birds and bees talk. He told me that no matter who I dated, sex should always be something special, a symbol of our commitment to each other, a lifelong commitment and not just something of the moment. Sex should be something special, shared only with the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess with Marcie, you could say I forgot that and I shouldn’t have because he was right, you know.” “Wow, all my dad told me was to never bring a nigger, spic, or gook chic home.” Davey snorted and I shook my head in disgust. President Jones would never have told his son that, but I guess the David Jones Sr. of this timeline had, and once again I missed the time I had grown up in, with the world Davey had created. “Ouch.” I said aloud and Davey nodded. “I thought he was a preacher.” “I thought he was too.” Davey said so sourly that I winced inwardly. “Davey, I hope you know that my folks and I, we don’t judge you by what your father has or has not done.” I said softly and Davey shook his head. “You’d be about the only people in the fucking county that haven’t.” He muttered with more bitterness than I could ever remember hearing from Davey before in any lifetime. “Sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you. You’ve been really cool.Why is that anyway?Is it because you feel sorry for me?” “I do feel sorry for you, yes.” I admitted and he frowned fiercely.“That’s not why I want to be your friend though.You’re a good guy, I can tell that, and you’ve been dealt a pretty fucking shitty hand by life, but none of that’s your fault.Despite all the shit you’ve been put through, you’re still a good guy. You care about your sister and your mother, and since we’ve been getting to know each other, you’ve shown you have a wicked sense of humor and make some pretty funny comments. I like that about you, and you’ve been helping me study some and that’s helped me out, and my other friends have all but abandoned me since I broke up with Marcie, but you could care less about that.” “Actually I don’t think I’d hang around you if you were still with her.” Davey said, surprising me with that comment. “That bitch – sorry but she is – she’s bad news and I don’t want to have anything to do with her or those bitches she hangs with.” “Why not?” I asked and he shrugged while plopping a grape into his mouth and chewing silently for a moment. “It’s nothing I can put my finger on, but just a feeling I get.” He answered.“It’s something to do with the way she looks at people.She looks at them like she’s measuring up what they can do for her, or give her and that’s all she cares about.Someone like that, it’s best to steer away from.” “I wish you’d been there to warn me off when I first started dating her.” I said in all honestly and he chuckled. “Sorry, I was stuck at Ceres Fucking High.” He said sourly.“Now that was a real pit-hole, let me tell you.” “At least you’re out of there now.” I reminded him and he laughed softly before stopping and looking towards the hallway leading to my parents’ room with a worried frown. “Don’t worry, the worst they’ll do is tell us to shut up and get to bed.” I assured him and he relaxed before getting a look of curiosity on his face. “Where am I going to sleep tonight?” Davey asked. “Your mom mentioned something about it being next week before they would have the guest room cleaned up.” “You can sleep in my bed, if you don’t mind.” I said with a shrug that I hoped appeared to be casual while there were butterflies in my stomach.My old mind and young body were going to war with each other all night and I’d probably not sleep at all, but at the same time it was a sweet agony that I longed for, to have him next to me again, if only for a night. “That’s fine, if you don’t mind.” He agreed and I nodded, breathing slowly so as to not look like I was sighing in relief. “I don’t.” I assured him. “What time do you want to get up in the morning?” “It should be as early as possible.” Davey said. “I really do appreciate all your help you know.I’ve got to work tomorrow night so if I can get the car fixed easily we should do it in the morning. Then I can go home and get yelled at for a bit before going to work.” “Why would they yell at you?” I asked with concern. “Oh it’s just my grandfather.” Davey said with a shake of his head.I found that the strangest of all the differences.Pete and Davey had gotten along like two peas in a pod before. What had changed so drastically. “He’s still pissed that I went over to see my dad a few times after he came back to California. That’s when he started locking me out if I got home after eleven-thirty.Every time I get home late, he thinks I’m out seeing my dad or something.” “P… Your grandfather doesn’t like your father, I take it?” I asked, almost slipping and calling his grandfather by his first name. “Yeah, Papa’s never really liked Dad and this whole mess proves that he’s always been right about Dad.” Davey said with a frown and a heavy sigh.“It doesn’t matter to him that the only reason I went over there was to confront Dad and make him admit what he did to my sister, and I actually hit him!I fucking punched him in the gut, made him double over and every thing, but no, none of that matters to Papa. Now he thinks I’m taking Dad’s side in everything every time he or Nanny start bitching about Dad. I mean, sure Dad fucked up big time and he’s really messed up all our lives, but they don’t have to fucking put him down with every damn other word out of their mouths!” “No, they don’t.” I agreed with him, hoping my parents wouldn’t react badly to the rising voice. I could hear some shuffling from the hallway, but fortunately Davey was too far gone into his grief and anger to notice.He raised his light blue eyes, tears filling them, and a long moment of silence passed between us as he searched my eyes and face for any hint of sarcasm or derision, or any other negative reaction. “I do love him still, you know.” Davey said in a voice that shook, and a part of me knew that he’d never shared this with anyone else yet, and a deep sense of honor filled me. Once, just once, my Davey had shared part of this with me, but it had been a hundred years of his lifetime since these events had happened, and the grief had been old.Here, now, it was fresh, and the wounds were still bleeding in his heart. “He’s your father.” I said softly and Davey’s eyes were latched onto mine.“Of course you love him.” “Then why don’t they see that?” Davey asked as his shoulders began to shake with suppressed sobs. “Why do they have to be so damn angry and badmouth him every chance they get?” “Maybe they’re hurt and don’t know any other way to express the hurt.” I offered and he seemed to mull over the statement. “Davey, it doesn’t justify them hurting you in the process, but it might explain why…” “It’s so fucking unfair!” Davey growled before giving in to the tears with a sniffle.His eyes were leaking the tears now and he wiped his nose with the back of a hand. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be…” “Shhh.” I said softly, moving my chair around the table towards him, and when I reached my arms out he fell into them, resting his head on my shoulder as he just sobbed.“Let it out, Davey, you can let it out here.” “It’s just so unfair.” He moaned again while his entire body shook. I looked up to see my parents standing in the doorway with looks of sorrow and approval mixed on their faces. They nodded briefly before my father put an arm around my mother, who was wearing her rose-colored nightgown, and they walked back to their room.Davey was oblivious to their presence as he cried into my shoulder for a long time. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t dump on you like this…” “Promise me you’ll return the favor if I ever need it.” I said softly as he pulled back from leaning on me.For a long time he looked deeply into my eyes before nodding. “If you ever need me, I’ll be there.” He promised fervently and I smiled. “Good, I can always use a good friend.” I said just as fervently and he actually smiled in response to me. “You about ready for bed?” “Yeah, I could use some sleep.” He said with a yawn, and we put the empty glasses of milk away before heading into my room. Davey paused hesitantly when I shut the door behind me and looked at me with a questioning expression. “Um right or left side?” “I’ll take the right.” I said, remembering how he always liked sleeping on the left.He nodded, and turned his back to me as he began to get undressed. I could see the way he sneaked a look at me as I got ready for bed, but when I climbed into bed after him, there was a good arm’s length between us.He let out a heavy sigh as he fell asleep with his back to me, but I lay awake for a long time, listening to his breathing. Part of me still missed my Davey, and our kids, but another part of me was looking forward to a new lifetime, knowing the man I had spent so many years loving was still here, deep down in this Davey Jones. Chapter 7 “Boys, you better get a move on if you want some of this food mom’s cooking!” Dad’s voice, and his fist banging on the door woke me up the next morning and I started with surprise. Sometime during the night, the arm’s length between us had disappeared, and my arms were wrapped around Davey, who had his back to me. My morning erection was sticking out the top of my underwear, and it was nestled tightly against Davey’s back, where he could probably feel it as he stirred. With flaming cheeks, I pushed myself back a bit from him, but didn’t remove my arms from around him. He was shifting now, and I wondered if I could casually move my hands down from his chest and feel his own morning erection, and part of me wanted to do that, but I knew it was not time for that yet.Still, it was nice having him in my arms. “We’re getting up, dad!” I called out and my father moved off.To my surprise, Davey started chuckling and actually leaned back against me, although he arched his back so it wouldn’t come into contact with my erection. “Good morning.” I whispered to him, and he started laughing harder.“What’s so funny?” “Oh, I don’t know.” Davey whispered and turned sideways so he could look at my face.There was a broad smile on his.“Marcie would have a coronary if she walked in now, and your dad probably would too. Thanks though.I hope it’s not too freaky for you waking up like this.I had a nightmare and the next thing I knew you were hugging me and it just…” “I’m not freaked out.” I assured him and he arched an eyebrow with a semi-familiar leer on his face. “Really, what about if I did this?” He said before leaning forward like he was going to kiss me.I pulled back and slapped his chest, causing him to push my hands away and they ended up on his belly. “Dude, what the fuck is this?” I asked, slapping his belly and he frowned before defensively pushing my hands away. “I know I need to lose weight.” He grumbled. “It’s just tough you know, working in a fucking fast food place and never really having all that much time for a real meal, and Nanny’s always pushing food at me as if that’ll make the world better and I don’t have any time for exercise.” “Bullshit.” I said firmly, sitting up enough to rest my head on my right hand while looking at him sternly. “We’ll make time.I tell you what, I usually run three times a week in the mornings. You and I will meet at the school an hour before school starts and go running.” “You want me to give up an hour of sleep?” Davey said with a startled look.“Do you know how little sleep I get as it is?I can’t even crawl into bed until after Nanny and Papa finish watching the news. Then it’s another thirty minutes before they finish locking up, setting the alarms and actually get into bed.” “I thought you couldn’t go home if it was after eleven-thirty and they’re still up?” I exclaimed in confusion and he frowned. “Nanny would try to sneak me in, but if I’m not back yet, Papa gets up five minutes early and turns on the alarm.” Davey answered. “She doesn’t know the code and he won’t tell anyone else at all, and he’s the type that would wait for the police to show up and have them haul me off.” “Sometimes I don’t get your grandfather at all.” I said, full well being able to imagine Pete doing that if he was pissed enough. “Yeah, well, enough of that.” Davey said with false cheerfulness.“Whatever your mom’s cooking sure smells good.” “I’ve got dibs on the shower.” I said with a smile as I hopped out of bed.Davey just stretched before laying back down, and I couldn’t help but smile as I noticed him pulling my pillow to him when he thought I’d left the room. Mom had delivered Davey’s clean clothes while I was in the shower and he was already dressed as I entered with nothing but a towel around my waist.He blushed before stammering out that he’d be in the dining room, and I smirked to myself. Davey was such a contradiction, fluctuating between being flirty with me and embarrassed about being caught looking at me.Since we’d probably be leaving soon after breakfast, I dressed in an old pair of jeans and equally old shirt that was only a little tight, but it did show off my chest fairly well. Davey was wearing the clothes he’d worn to school yesterday, although they were freshly cleaned by mom. “You young men mind if I go along with you?” Dad asked as we ate the pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs that mom had cooked. “I was once a fair hand with cars.” “Sure.” Davey said after looking at me for approval.If Dad wanted to help, I wasn’t going to argue.He was definitely better than me when it came to cars. “Good, after we finish here I’ll get my tools.” Dad said and Davey breathed a sigh of relief. “I was worried I might have to ask my father for help.” He said in answer to dad’s questioning look. “When I wrecked mom’s car after getting my license he had to help me fix the rear axle I bent.” “Don’t worry about that.” Dad said firmly, but there was a gentle smile on his face that seemed to encourage Davey. “I appreciate all the help you’re giving me.” Davey said politely, but the undertones in his voice showed how much he meant every word. “It’s nothing.” Mom said with a smile. “Besides, if it’s keeping Brian out of trouble, it’s all to the good.” “Hey!” I protested, but she was already laughing with dad.When breakfast was done, we headed out and dad followed us in his car after loading it with some tools. Davey kept up an easy monologue for a while, talking about a friend of his from Nevada.It was obvious he missed the place, and had been happy there.From what my Davey had told me of the place and living there the second time he’d gone back, I could understand this Davey missing the place. “What the hell?” Davey asked as we pulled into the parking lot of the McDonald’s.Like all the employees he parked near the back, and as we pulled into the spot next to his car, I could see why he was upset.Both tires on this side were flat, and more than likely the other two were as well, which we learned after getting out of the car and looking at the other side. Dad pulled up behind us, and was looking at the car with a grim expression while Davey fingered the slit edge of the rear driver’s side tire.Someone had done a good job slitting his tires, and a rage built in my gut as I took a good guess as to who was responsible. “I’m going to fucking kill her.” I said in a very loud voice while a slender, older woman in a manager’s uniform walked out of the restaurant. “Brian, watch your language!” Dad said sharply as Davey stood up and turned around.His eyes were moist, and his lower lip quivered. I wanted to wrap my arms around him and comfort him, but I knew that this was not the place or the time. “How am I going to pay for this?” Davey moaned softly.“Jenny’s psychotherapist needs to be paid and I have to make the car payment and I could barely scrounge up enough for a starter and…” “David?” The female manager asked in a worried tone.“I’m sorry David, I tried calling your house to tell you this morning when I came in but they said you were over at a friend’s.” “I… my car wouldn’t start last night and Brian picked me up.” Davey said in a weak voice. He shook his head slightly as she moved to stand next to him.“Janice, the tires were fine when I left last night.” “They were fine when the closers left.” Janice said in a worried tone.“I don’t understand why someone would do this, you’re the sweetest boy here.” “It wasn’t someone from the restaurant.” I said through gritted teeth and Davey looked up at me with a worried look. “She wouldn’t do this, would she?” He asked and his lower lip started quivering again.“Why would she do this to me?” “Why do you think Marcie did this, Brian?” Dad asked in a low, quiet tone that was still filled with fatherly command. “She saw us last night when we were pulling out of the restaurant, and she gave us both a dirty look.” I said, not wanting to get into the part about her going down on Spencer. Had she gotten him to do it?In a selfish way I hoped it had been him and not – not Trevor or Brandon. “So you think she’d take her anger out on David?” Dad said with a questioning tone.“That doesn’t make a lot of sense.” “Who is this Marcie?” Janice asked coldly. “Brian’s ex-girlfriend.” Davey said softly. “What would she have against you?” Janice asked him. “It’s not so much Davey directly as anyone she sees me with.” I explained what I thought was her reasoning. Yeah, I was calming down, but I was still pissed. While I seriously doubted Brandon or Trevor might say something to her about my interest in Davey, I was seriously regretting having ever shared that with them. “She’s a vindictive bi–woman.” “If she ever comes into my restaurant, I want you to point her out to me, you hear me David?” Janice said vehemently. “I want to throw her out on her ass and never let her back in here.” “Thanks, Janice.” Davey said with a slight chuckle that faded away as he looked back at his car.That was when I noticed that dad wasn’t by us anymore, but was at the payphone near the entrance. “It’s not a problem, David, and I want you to take the day off to get this fixed.” She said firmly and Davey started to protest. “I can’t, I’m going to need the money more now that I have to pay for all this!”He protested vehemently. “I’m paying you for the day as long as you keep your mouth shut about me being anything other than a cranky old witch, you hear me?” She said in a tone that brooked no argument. He sighed before swallowing glumly and looking at her for a long moment. “Thank you.” He said softly and she patted him on the back before heading back inside.Davey turned to look at the car again, and his shoulders started to shake again. Damn appearances to hell, I decided and stepped up beside him, putting an arm over his shoulder and pulling him in tight for a one-armed hug. “I’m supposed to be the one who helps people, not the one getting help.” Davey muttered bitterly. “This isn’t your fault.” I told him softly. “I’m sorry she did this and I want to help fix it, okay?” “I’ll figure something out.” Davey muttered. “Davey, I bear some responsibility for this.” I said firmly.“Let me pay my part, please.” “I’ve called a tow-truck.” Dad said as he approached us again. I looked up from Davey’s car to see him nodding in approval at my comforting Davey. “I’ll pay for it, Mr. B.” Davey said and a fleeting smile crossed my lips at the fond shortening of my father’s last name that he’d used in the last timeline, first as Mr. B and then as Dad B as time went by. “You’ll do no such thing.” Dad said in a voice that jerked Davey’s head up. “But it’s my car and…” Davey started to protest and Dad held up a hand to stop him from going any further. “David, I’m going to ask you a few questions and I want you to answer them honestly, okay?” Dad asked in a softer tone. “If, after I’m done asking them, you still don’t want my help that will be that, okay?” “Okay.” Davey said sullenly. “What do you do with most of your paycheck?” Dad asked, already knowing the answer. “Most of it goes to help Mom and Jenny.” Davey answered. “I make my car payments, insurance, gas and all that with the rest.” “You’ve told me that before, so it was just a warm-up.” Dad said.“Now, here’s the important question, if you have to pay for tires and the repairs to your car, how is that going to affect the rest of your family?” “Jenny will have to miss a few sessions, and she’s just starting to make real progress.” Davey said with a frown. “I’ll end up behind on the car payments too, and since Nanny co-signed the loan she’ll have to make them up until I can pay her back and that’ll make it more difficult to stay in the city, even with your help, while mom has her surgery.” “Would you object to me helping out your sister, your mother, or your grandmother?” Dad asked and I smiled at where he was going with this.It was like he knew Davey almost as well as I did, and it was just the right argument to use. I should have thought of this first, what with how well I knew Davey’s stubborn pride. “No.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Then think of it as helping you help them.” Dad said gently and Davey nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Breckenridge.” He said to my father. “You’re a good young man, David.” Dad said firmly, staring into Davey’s eyes.“Don’t let life’s little challenges bow you down, and don’t refuse help freely offered with no strings attached.” “I’ll pay you back, I promise.” Davey said firmly. “How about you pay me back some other way than money?” Dad asked. “Like what?” Davey asked as a tow-truck pulled into the parking lot. “Let me think on that for a while.” Dad asked him. “I promise, we’ll work something out, but I don’t want to take needed cash away from your family.” “As long as we can work something out.” Davey said stubbornly and Dad reached out his hand for them to shake on it. As the tow-truck driver got out, I dropped my arm from around Davey’s shoulders, and he straightened up a bit as Dad went to talk to the driver. “I never should have called you for help last night.” Davey sighed softly, more to himself than to me, and I knew what he was saying.He wasn’t blaming me, he was blaming himself. “You’re right.” I said firmly and he looked up in surprise.“If you hadn’t called me you’d have not had your tires slashed.I’m sorry.” “That’s not what I meant!” Davey protested, but when he saw me smiling he stopped and started chuckling. “Okay, I get your point.” “Good, don’t forget it again.” I said as sternly as I could. “Brian you need to move your car for the driver to get David’s car on the flatbed.” Dad said to me as he finished talking with the beefy truck driver.“David, you’ve got the day off, and I’m going to head over to the garage with the tow-truck to get things started.It’s a good thing I know one that’s open today.If they can’t get it done today, Brian will drive you around to where you need to go for the weekend since he bears some obligation based on what he thinks happened. If you want to spend the night again, you’re more than welcome.I do suggest you stop by your house to let your family know you’re okay, though.” “We can do that first.” I said with a smile before Davey could protest.He took one look at my father’s face and slowly nodded his agreement. “Good, now Brian, here’s your allowance for the week, have fun with it.” Dad said, handing me another wad of cash, and I knew it wasn’t my allowance.Breaking all conventions of being a teenager, I hugged my father there in plain view of anyone driving by, and he patted me on the back before pushing me off towards my mustang. Davey stuck his hand out and my dad pulled him in for a hug too.Unlike me, Davey stayed in the hug a bit longer, soaking up the affection my father was so freely offering, and he was almost smiling when he got into the car. He’d handed Dad the keys to his car before getting into mine. “So, we’re off!” I said in high spirits, pretending not to notice how he looked back at his car with a worried look before I pulled onto McHenry and headed south towards Ceres. Davey sat quietly for most of the drive, brooding most likely about his car and I knew enough not to bother him as I turned onto J Street before heading down 9th towards Ceres.He snapped out of the brooding when I pulled onto Highway 99, which 9th Street turned into just south of the only gay dance club in Modesto. “You need to take Whitmore.” Davey said softly and I nodded.He then spoke only to give me directions, which I followed without telling him I knew where his grandparents lived.I’d been to both their houses in the last timeline, and both his mother’s parents and his father’s mother had lived in their houses until they’d died in the last timeline. They were right around the corner from each other, and I had never appreciated how rough that must have been in this timeline, when the two sides of his family blamed each other for the problems associated with Davey’s father. If I remembered it correctly, and I was certain I did, Grandma Jones blamed Davey’s mother for having Davey’s father arrested. Davey’s mother rightly blamed his father for what he’d done to Jenny.She’d pressed charges so that Jenny could get help from the state for her counseling but that had only lasted a year and now Davey was helping to make the payments for the continued counseling. Davey’s grandparents’ home was the same ugly dark green I remembered it being in this timeframe, and I recognized his mother’s RX-7 parked in front of it, plus the large brown Buick his grandmother drove, as well as the large light-brown van that was his grandfather’s. I parked in by his mother’s car, and got out with him. “You sure about having me over for the weekend?” Davey asked me.“I’ve got to work tomorrow too.” “It won’t be a problem.” I assured him. “We can work on our history project later.” “Okay.” Davey said and then he paused before the sidewalk that led up to the house.There was a frown on his face.“I should warn you, it’s barely ten in the morning and my grandmother and mother usually lounge around in their nightgowns until around noon.” “Don’t worry, I’m not going to embarrass you at school.” I assured him with a laugh, remembering a few times we’d come over here in the last timeline to find his grandmother still in her furry pink housecoat at two in the afternoon on Saturdays.He chuckled for a moment before getting his brooding look back and we headed up to the door.The fact that Davey didn’t have a key to the door wasn’t really a surprise considering his grandfather’s attitude, but I wondered how a person could call anyplace a home when he didn’t have the keys to get inside. “You’re home!” Monta Barrow, Davey’s grandmother said after Davey had rung the doorbell.Sure enough she was wearing her fuzzy pink robe.She looked slightly embarrassed when she saw me standing behind Davey. “Who is this?” “Nanny, this is my friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Davey said softly.“Brian, this is my grandmother, Monta Barrow.” “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Barrow.” I said politely and she smiled slightly. “I wish I’d known you were bringing company, Davey!” She chided him in a loving tone. “I’m just lounging here in my robe having a cup of coffee!Come in, boys. It’s nice to meet you, Brian.” The house was exactly as I remembered it being, with the kitchen immediately off to the right and a short entryway leading off to the right towards the living room and a hallway down the left leading to the bedrooms and bathrooms.Right at the end of the entryway was a big mirror running from floor to ceiling, and I was struck by how young I looked in the reflection. Every time I saw myself, I was reminded at how young I looked when just a short while ago I had looked far older than Davey’s grandmother. “Are you boys hungry?” She asked as she led us through the kitchen towards the attached dining room where Davey’s mother was sipping a cup of hot tea, wearinga black velvet robe with red piping.Her brown curly hair was slightly matted and her eyes had a pinched look to them, probably from pain, as Davey introduced us. “No thanks, Nanny, Brian’s mom made breakfast for us a few hours ago.” Davey answered his grandmother’s question. “What’s wrong with your car?” Davey’s mother said shortly, and I realized it was more from the fact that she was having trouble breathing than from anger.Davey might not have realized that from the defensive look on his face. “The starter’s gone bad on it.” Davey said, and when he said nothing about the tires, I took the hint and decided not to mention them.“It’s being fixed.” “Oh great, how are we going to afford that?” His mother moaned and I was amazed at how different she was than the self-confident, always calm and prepared woman I’d known in the last timeline. “Brian’s father is paying for it.” Davey said weakly.“He’s loaning me the money.” “The same man who is helping us with a place to stay in the city?” Nanny asked as she sat down with her cup of coffee. Davey and I both sat at the large oval table as well. “Yes, the same man.” Davey said softly. “Your father is truly a Christian man.” Nanny said to me and it was hard not to laugh.Dad hadn’t set foot inside a church in years, but I understood her sentiment. “Why would he do that?” Davey’s mom asked. “What’s in it for him?” “I’ll pay him back, it’s just a loan.” Davey said, stretching the truth just a bit, but from the way his mother relaxed slightly I got the feeling it was the right thing to say. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work in a little bit?” His mother asked him sharply, and I began to wonder at the deep differences she was showing.It was almost like she was going out of her way to find things wrong with Davey, and that worried me more than anything.Maybe it was just the pain she was in right now. “Janice gave me the day off, with pay.” Davey said defensively, his face clouding over. “I asked Davey if we could use the time to work on our history project some more.” I said, jumping into the fray when she opened her mouth to say something.It was probably going to be something scathing from the look on her face, but she looked at me with cloudy eyes, as if seeking to find something wrong with what I said. “Who is this?” A familiar gruff voice asked from the kitchen and I looked up to see Davey’s grandfather standing near the coffee pot, pouring himself a cup of coffee.He was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt and had a grumpy look on his face. “This is one of Davey’s friends.” Nanny answered in a knowing tone of voice.I stood up and took a few steps towards him with my hand held out as he looked me up and down. “My name is Brian Breckenridge, Mr. Barrow.” I said in a polite voice, shaking his hand firmly as he squeezed mine in a testing manner.He looked me in the eyes for a long moment before letting a grunt. “A sight better than that other boy Davey brought around a couple of weeks ago.” He harrumphed before releasing my hand and sitting down at the head of the table.“What’s wrong with that stupid car of yours now, Davey?” “Starter’s out, Papa.” Davey said. “You going to want my help to fix it?” He asked as if the notion was a noxious idea, but I was pretty sure I saw a glint of something deep in his eyes. “Um, Brian’s dad is having it worked on.” Davey said.“He’s loaning me the money to fix it and I’ll pay him back.” “See that you do, boy.” Papa said gruffly, and while there was a hint of disappointment in his eyes, I could see there was also a grudging respect.Was it respect because Davey had found a solution to the problem without having to get help? That would fit the Pete Barrow I’d known before. “I will, Papa.” Davey said plaintively, getting a frown from the old man. “What’s your father do, young man?” Pete asked me directly and I smiled. “He’s a manager at Union Bank in Modesto.” I answered and he frowned for a moment. “I think I know him.” Pete said with a shake of his head.“You’ve got his eyebrows if it’s him that I remember.” “You know him.” I said with a slight laugh and he nodded his head.The man always did make me a little nervous.“Have you been fishing lately?I saw your boat around the side of the house.” “It’s too damn cold right now.” He grunted. “You fish?” “A little.” I admitted honestly. “Dad and I usually try to make it up for a camping trip during the spring at least once a year.” “I’ll have to invite him the next time I go.” Pete said as if it was a burden, but I could see a little gleam in his eye. “Kind of in the way of thanking him for his helping the family.Maybe we’ll drag you two boys with us.” “I…” Davey started to try backing out from the look on his face, but my stomping on his foot stopped him cold. “That’d be nice, Mr. Barrow.” I said calmly, ignoring the glare from Davey.“I’m sure my dad would like to do that.” “Good.” He said with a nod before getting up from his seat.“You boys going to hang around here today or what?” “We’ve got a history project to work on for school, sir.” I said and he looked at me for a long moment. “You better make sure he puts some effort into it.” Pete said with a scowl.“If he wants to get into college he’s going to have to work harder at his books than he has been.” “We will.” I said while Davey scowl returned. “Good, then it’s been nice meeting you.” Pete said before taking his coffee with him into the living room where he used the patio sliding door to get into the back yard.Davey was staring at me like I was a demon or something, and his grandmother and mother were also looking at me like they’d never seen someone like me before.It was then that I realized why I’d liked Pete so much.He reminded me so much of Davey when Davey got older, although Davey was never quite as gruff. “So how long will you be gone, Davey?” His mother asked him after a long silence while everyone stared at me.It seemed that, with Pete’s approval of Davey going to study at my house, the matter was settled. “Um, I have to work early in the afternoon tomorrow and Brian’s offered to give me a ride, so I was going to ask if I could stay over at his place tonight.” Davey said softly. “What’ll you do if your car’s not fixed by Monday?” His grandmother asked.“I’ve got to take your mother to the city for a doctor’s appointment Monday, and she’s got to go for more tests here in town for most of Tuesday.” “I can either pick him up or drop him off here, or he can stay at our place until his car is fixed.” I spoke up before Davey could answer.“My parents said it was okay.They understand how tough things are right now, and that your first priority has to be getting ready for your surgery.” “That’s mighty kind of your folks.” Monta Barrow said with a smile.“Shantill’s mother is going to be staying here while I run Sandy around, so that’ll work just fine.” “You will call, won’t you, Davey?” His mother asked in a worried tone, and Davey got up to hug her tightly. “It’s only for a day or two, Mom.” Davey said softly.“Everything’s going to be fine. The doc’s going to do this surgery and you’re going to feel better than you have in years.” “I hope so.” She said softly, all the edge of anger gone from her voice as they hugged.There were tears in my eyes, and I remembered how devoted Davey had been to his mother.Despite the anger that often flared between them, they’d been close, almost as if their bickering and arguing was a glue that bound them together. “I better get some clothes.” Davey said softly, breaking the hug and looking over at me with a hint of a sarcastic smile. “Let me show you my ‘room’, Brian.” “Okay” I said while noticing the look of hurt that went across his grandmother’s face.She gave me a wan smile as I stood up and followed Davey down into the ‘family room’.It was really just a step down from the dining room.A big-screen projection television dominated the far end of the room, and we walked behind the two armchairs and around the couch where a twin bed was stuffed up against the far wall.A stereo sat on a speaker, although the large headphones attested to the fact that music was rarely ever played over the speaker.A dresser stood against the wall, and to the immediate right were the sliding doors that hid the washer and dryer.My heart went out to Davey at the total lack of privacy, since we could hear his mother and grandmother talking in quiet but urgent tones in the dining room. “Welcome to my little corner of paradise.” Davey said softly in a voice that dripped with sarcasm.He pulled out a paper bag from a corner since he’d left his duffel bag at my house, and began to open the drawers of the small dresser and pulled out some clothes.“How much should I pack?” “Enough for today and tomorrow, at least.” I said. “Your uniform’s still at the house.” “That’s right.” He said as he pulled out a couple pairs of frayed underwear, some socks with holes in them, and a pair of jeans and two shirts that had seen better days.He put them in the bag, folded the top over and smiled.“Well, I’m ready.” “Let’s head out.” I said as nicely as I could. The feelings running through me were mixed at best.Part of me felt really bad for him having to live like this, but another part of me remembered the look of hurt in his grandmother’s face and I felt bad for her.",

      "content": "“If he hadn’t done this to Jenny then poor Davey wouldn’t have to live like this.” Monta was saying and I winced slightly. “Oh yes, it’s all his fault.” Davey’s voice dripped sarcasm and anger and I tried to look away so I wouldn’t see the look of hurt on his mother’s face.“It’s not like he was the one who told me we were going on a vacation for a few days when we were really leaving forever and didn’t even give me the chance to say goodbye to my friends.” “David Ray Jones Jr., how dare you say that?” His grandmother fumed. “Your mother did the right thing getting you away from that beast of a man!I should have made her do it years ago when I saw him beat you.” “He didn’t beat me.” Davey shot back angrily and I wondered if there was anything I could say to calm this situation down. It made me decidedly uncomfortable to be stuck like this, torn between the hurt I knew Davey felt and the pain I saw in the eyes of the two women.There was nothing I needed to do, though, as the sound of a baby crying came from the back of the house. “Now look what you’ve done!” Davey’s mother complained as Monta got up and hurried back into the house, muttering about Davey waking up the baby. “Then maybe it’s good I’ll be gone until tomorrow at least.” Davey said sourly.His face did soften as his mother looked hurt, though.“I love you, Mom.” “I love you too, Davey.” His mother said softly and the look of hurt faded a bit from her face. “It was nice to meet you, ma’am.” I said softly, and she returned my smile briefly before nodding. “Let’s get going.” Davey said in a voice that was so conflicted with emotion that I couldn’t quite place all of them. I followed him out of the house and we got into the car before I drove off, heading back up to Modesto. He was silent and brooding again, but now it was about things other than his car. As much as I wanted to comfort him, I also knew that a part of the problem was more than his family’s actions towards him, but his reactions to the situation they were in, and I would have to think about that.Anyone in his situation would be torn and conflicted, as he obviously was, and I wondered how best to help him.Well, being a good friend was always a good start to any situation like this, and I would always be the best friend any Davey Jones could ask for in life. Chapter 8 While Davey and I spent most of the afternoon working on our history project, Mom and Dad spent the time cleaning out the guest bedroom. The Davey I had known had a hundred years or more of life experiences behind his argumentation skills, but this Davey was just seventeen and showed the diamond in the rough that would become his debating skills later in life. He had some good theories, and we spent most of the time hashing them out. When they paused for lunch, my parents seemed to enjoy listening to Davey and I argue about different ideas for our project. While the discussion grew a little heated at times, Davey seemed happier than he’d been in a while as he focused on something besides the troubles in his life. I understood it was a respite for him, and I wanted to make the most of it for him. “Boys, why don’t you take a break?” My father suggested as we approached dinner time. It was starting to get dark outside and I hadn’t realized so much time had passed. “Brenda and I were thinking of having an adult’s night out, going out to dinner and a movie. Would you like to tag along or do your own thing?” “Has there been any word on my car?” Davey asked with a touch of nervousness. “None since earlier this afternoon.” Dad answered. “They said then it might take a few days to get the parts they needed. I hoped you don’t mind, but Janice came out for a smoke before the tow-truck left and she mentioned to me that you aren’t scheduled for work on Monday or Tuesday.” “That’s right.” Davey said with a frown. “I don’t mind taking you around town and I won’t miss practice since you don’t have to work.” I spoke up immediately and my dad smiled at me. “If you want to make things easier and stay here, the guest room is ready for you.” Dad suggested calmly. “I know it’ll make things easier for Brian, and I imagine with how crowded your grandparents’ house sounds, it won’t be a bad thing for them either.” “I’ll call mom and ask.” Davey said softly. “I’m worried about her; she didn’t look that good this morning.” “She’s going to be fine, Davey.” Dad said reassuringly, and I was surprised to see how Davey’s shoulders slumped in relief a bit. His reaction to my father was different than his reaction to the adults in his family, and I wondered how much the whole mess with his own father was a part of their angry interactions with each other. “Give her a call though. Right now she needs to worry about her own health first and foremost. Let her know you’re doing fine and it’ll help.” “If you say so, Mr. B.” Davey said softly and got up to go use the phone. Dad looked over at me with a look of concern on his face. I’d had a few moments earlier in the day to tell him about what I’d seen at Davey’s ‘home’ during our visit this morning. Davey had been in the bathroom, and that had given me just enough time to share the highlights with Dad. My father had been shocked hearing my description of Davey’s ‘bed’ and while we both knew it was better than being on the street, the total lack of privacy Davey had to live with was shocking to us. “Order a pizza if you guys stay in, okay?” Dad asked and I nodded. “Thank you for doing all this dad.” I said quietly. “I know it’s not like he’s been a family friend for a while or anything, but I really appreciate how much you’re helping him out.” “He’s a good guy.” Dad said softly. “I’d only hope that if you ever were in a situation like his that someone else would do what we’re doing for you. It sounds like his family has a lot of issues to work through, and while they are doing that, they can’t really pay him the attention he needs. We can, and we will.” “Thanks.” I said again and he nodded before heading out to go talk with Mom. Davey came back a moment later with a frown on his face. “What’s wrong?” I asked him and he sighed. “Just Mom being a mom.” He answered cryptically and I let it go at that. “I’m tired of working on the project. How about we do something else?” “I could use a run.” I said and he frowned. “You making another reference to my stomach?” He said defensively and I realized I should have said something else with him already feeling defensive from his conversation with his mother. “No.” I said with a shrug. “I just know that when I’m feeling uptight I like to work out. It helps me, so I thought it might help you.” “It’s better than having a cigarette, I guess.” He said with a shrug and I grimaced. “Yeah, it is.” I agreed with him. “I didn’t bring any running clothes.” He said and I stood up to lead the way to my bedroom. “Don’t worry, we’re the same shoe size and I have an old pair of running shoes and some sweats you can wear.” I assured him. “Jeez, it’s like you’re trying to make me dress all preppy like you.” He said, but there was a hint of humor in his voice. “Well, we’ve got to have you looking your best if you’re going to be my best friend.” I said as we entered my bedroom and I realized he’d stopped in the doorway, looking at me hard. “I thought you already had a best friend.” He said softly, but there was a glistening look in his eyes that sent chills down my spine. “They seem to be more interested in kissing Marcie’s ass instead of being friends with me.” I said with a shrug. “You’re not going to do that, are you? I mean even if she slashes your tires again?” “She can blow up my car and I won’t walk away.” Davey said softly with gleaming eyes locked on mine. “You and your family are the best thing to happen to me in a long time.” “Good, we feel the same way about you.” I said. “Why?” Davey asked and I smiled gently. “You just told me why.” I replied. “You said she could blow up your car, and dude, I know how important a car is to a guy our age, and she wouldn’t be able to keep you from being my friend. Her and I break up, and I find out who my true friends are, and you’re here. That means a lot to me, you know.” “It means a lot what your folks are doing for me, too.” Davey reiterated and I nodded. “So, now we know another part of why we’re friends and you don’t have to doubt why you’re welcome here.” I said with a shrug. “Now let’s get ready for a run.” “Okay.” Davey said with a bit of a grin on his face. We got dressed, and I couldn’t help notice the sly looks he was giving me. I posed when I noticed the looks, and wondered if he realized that I was posing, but didn’t care. Our friendship was developing just fine, and as much as my body was crying for more as I put on my jock, I knew that it would come eventually. He didn’t have his own jock, and for a moment I considered offering one of my spares, but realized that would probably be a little too awkward just now. The only problem with just having the idea though was that I was fully hard at the thought, and suddenly didn’t want him noticing that. I finished getting dressed in a pair of blue Downey sweats and a black t-shirt while he wore a pair of my old blue sweats from freshman year and a yellow t-shirt. “Let’s stretch.” I said when we were dressed and he had finished putting on a pair of my old running shoes. He let out a little sigh at the comfort of them and I felt guilty again at how threadbare his wardrobe was. Come to think of it, the nicest clothes I’d seen him in lately had been those my mother had bought him as a belated birthday gift. A half-mile into the run, he was wheezing something bad, and I was astonished at how out of shape he was. The Davey I’d known would have set double the pace and not even broken into a sweat for the first mile at this age. How much had he been smoking? “Oh god, it’s been so long since I went for a run.” Davey moaned as we slowed to a fast walk and he tried to catch his breath. “How long has it been?” I asked him. “Over a year, since we moved from Nevada.” Davey explained. “That’s bad.” I said with a frown and he nodded. “Let’s pick up the pace.” He said in a determined tone that was very familiar, and very welcome. He had a half-smile on his face as we started jogging, albeit slower than before. “I use to run a lot back in Nevada.” Davey said with a slight wheeze after another half-mile. He was sweating profusely now, but he seemed determined to go on for at least a little more. “I use to do a lot of things in Nevada, for that matter.” “Why’d you stop?” I asked and he shrugged as we finished another half mile and he motioned for us to turn back. Three miles wasn’t exactly a lot, but for his first time out in a year, it was pretty damn good. “A lot of reasons.” Davey wheezed after we’d gone for a bit in silence. I slowed to a walk, and he followed my change of pace, lifting his arms over his head and stretching out while taking deep, steady breaths. We kept moving though, although the pace was just a rapid walk. “Part of it was just being depressed over the whole sack of shit that my life became.” “What happened?” I asked cautiously, not sure if he’d want to share. “I mean, I know what the papers said, but what happened really, for you?” “It sucked.” Davey answered bitterly. “Mom had been sick for a couple weeks with pneumonia and Nanny had come out to Nevada with Papa to care for her. Nanny now thinks Dad had been poisoning Mom, but I don’t really believe that at all. Anyway, Mom got better and the Saturday before Thanksgiving Mom asked me if I wanted to go with them to California for the holiday. I agreed since we weren’t playing any games at school and it was boring stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Dad was the only one who stayed behind. After Thanksgiving, I started asking when we were going back to Nevada, but Mom kept on putting me off saying she wasn’t feeling well.” “That’s not right.” I said, and while I’d heard parts of the story before, I’d never heard it like this or with the anger and venom in his voice. It also explained some facets of Davey’s psyche that I had never really understood before. “No, it wasn’t.” Davey agreed bitterly and picked the pace back up to a slow jog. “It was December before I learned we weren’t going back to Nevada. At first I threw a fit and demanded that if Mom wanted to divorce Dad, that was fine, but I wanted to live in Nevada.” “She didn’t tell you why?” I asked and he shook his head. “Not until they’d already enrolled me at Ceres High just in time for finals that I had no chance to prepare for.” Davey explained. “I got lucky and did alright and with the grades I’d already gotten in Eureka I eked out B’s in most of my classes, but I’d been getting a 3.8 GPA in Nevada, so all B’s kind of fucked me up there. I got real mad one night and told Mom she could either buy me a bus ticket back to Nevada or she could tell me what was really going on, and so she broke down and told me the truth about what Dad had done to Jenny.” “That must have been rough.” I said softly. “I didn’t believe her at first.” Davey said so softly I almost didn’t hear him, and he stopped jogging to turn and face me. There were tears in his eyes again. “How awful was that, my sister gets fucking raped by my own father and I didn’t fucking believe it when Mom told me! I was so fucking angry and so god-damn self-centered that all I cared about was getting back to Nevada and my fucking friends there. When Mom told me, I lost it, accusing her of lying just to keep me from siding with Dad against her. We were sitting in Nanny and Papa’s bedroom, with the door shut although I could hear Nanny hovering outside. Mom picked up the phone and called Dad right then and there, and put me on the phone without saying a word.” “Oh god.” I said fiercely, not believing the details I was hearing. Davey had never shared them with me before, and I wondered if that had been on purpose because of how painful they had been, or unintentional because they no longer hurt so much. Here, in this timeline, Davey’s eyes were leaking tears and his cheeks were flushed from more than our run. “I asked him right out, expecting to hear him deny it so that I could go back home to Nevada where I belonged.” Davey’s shoulders shook with sobs, but his body language was so angry and defensive I knew he didn’t want a hug or comfort. He wanted somebody to listen. Hearing this was so amazing for me, because it hadn’t been something I’d ever discussed with my Davey in detail, and it was like a door was opening to understanding the man I’d loved for decades. “My whole fucking world came crashing down on that phone call. When I told him what mother claimed, I waited for him to tell me it was all a lie. I was so ready to believe that, but he didn’t. All he did was start crying. My fucking father, who I could never remember crying like that, fucking broke down in sobs on the phone and told me how sorry he was. “FUCK YOU DAD!” Davey yelled into the darkening twilight and I shook with my own unshed tears for him. “How the fuck could he do that to her? But you know what’s the worst thing about it all? It’s not just what my fucking father did to my sister, it’s what my mother did to me! Her and my grandparents, and my sister, and everyone around me. Even Shantill, that fucking nitwit, knew what had happened, but could anyone even fucking tell me? No, they fucking lied to me and put me off like I couldn’t handle the truth! You wonder why I’m so mad at them? I saw the look on your face at Nanny’s, you know. That’s why I’m so fucking mad at them. They couldn’t even fucking tell me the goddamn truth about what my father had done to my sister! I had to force them to tell me!” “They were all wrong.” I said softly and he looked at me with fury and passion burning in his eyes. We were jogging along a canal path, empty at this time of year, and the only lights were from the stars, the rising moon, and cars in the distance. While our eyes remained locked on each other, I stepped towards him, and put my hands on his shoulders as my teary eyes bored into his. “They didn’t respect you, but what are you doing now? You’re working, giving them a lot of your hard-earned money to help, why?” “Because they’re my family and I care.” Davey said with an exhaled breath. “How could I turn my back on my sister after what she’s been through? My mother too. I know she didn’t do right by me, but I know why she did it. It hurt, and she was afraid I’d still go back to him even knowing the truth. It hurts she didn’t trust me, but she’s still my mother and I know she loves me.” “You’re a good guy, Davey Jones.” I said softly and he blushed slightly. “No, don’t be embarrassed. I don’t know many guys would go through what you’ve been through and still care a bit about his family.” “I’m not all that good.” Davey said softly as he looked at the cars in the distance. It was getting chilly out, and the fact that we’d been sweating didn’t help, but neither of us wanted to move at this moment. “You want to know another reason why Papa doesn’t let me in after eleven-thirty? It’s because last year at Ceres I got mixed up with stoners. I’d stay out late with them getting drunk and stoned. It felt good to let go, to forget my problems and drift along all numb to the pain. That’s why they really helped me get into Downey, to get me away from those guys, but it didn’t really work. Most of the money I have left over I spend getting pot for them and me and alcohol for Ronna or Jeannette when I can’t hang around the stoners. So you see, I’m not really a good guy.” “Bullshit.” I snapped angrily, not just at the fact that he was doing drugs and drinking like mad at times. His eyes snapped back to me at the word, and I locked gazes with him. “Good people can make bad decisions without becoming bad themselves.” “Tell it to Mrs. Dent.” He said and I almost lost the reference until I remembered the junior high math teacher who taught positive/negative multiplication with a silly reference to bad things happening to good people being a bad thing, and bad things happening to bad people being a good thing. “Real life is more complicated than that.” I reminded him and he looked at me as if he was longing to hear the next words out of my mouth. “I know it hurts, Davey.” “How could you?” Davey asked angrily as he pulled away from me and crossed his arms to stare at me in his anger. “You’ve got the perfect fucking family, Brian. Your parents, most people would kill to have parents like them. God knows I would sell my soul for parents like them, so what the fuck could you know about hurting?” “I had a favorite uncle.” I said slowly, trying to mix the truth with the reality of this timeline without outright lying to Davey. Building a relationship on a foundation of lies was a bad thing, or should I just tell him the full truth right now? Was he ready for that? “Uncle Rich and I use to do a lot of things together and he was like this god-figure when I was younger. He could do no wrong, and I loved talking to him on the phone, and visiting him.” “Let me guess, he died in an accident or something?” Davey sneered and for a moment I felt really angry at him. “He died of AIDS back in 1981, just after Christmas.” I said softly, and truthfully. Davey’s face contorted in a mix of emotions before he frowned at me. “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “Did he get it through a blood transfusion?” “No, he caught it because his partner liked to sleep around.” I said bitterly and he frowned before his eyes widened. “Don’t you dare say something about ‘fags’ or ‘queers’ either, Davey Jones. He was my uncle and I loved him. He should fucking be alive right now!” “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “That’s not all.” I said fiercely, wanting to make sure he did realize that I could understand hurt and loss. “Every Thanksgiving we usually go see my grandparents back east. This last time, the fucking bitch Marcie decided to have me spend time with her family and like an idiot, I agreed. My grandparents decided to come out here and they fucking died in a car accident on the I-5 in heavy fog, all because I listened to my bitch of a girlfriend.” “Shit.” Davey said and this time he stepped closer to me, and I could feel his hands on my arms as more tears came to my eyes. Yes, it hadn’t been me exactly who had done that, made those decisions, or had watched Uncle Rich die, but in many ways it really had been me and if the choices I had made had not created this timeline, they’d have never happened. Someday I’d tell him that part of all this. “Yeah, shit.” I said bitterly. “So, you know, Davey Jones, my little life isn’t perfect after all. Yes I’ve got damn fucking good parents, but that doesn’t guarantee me a perfect little life.” “I’m sorry.” He said softly. “I got so wrapped up in me that…” “Yeah, well, let’s head home.” I said, turning to wrap my arm around his shoulder and he sagged against me as we began walking back to the house. We walked in silence, but it was a good silence. When we were getting closer to the house, I dropped my arm and we walked next to each other. “Your uncle, your parents knew he was…gay and still let you around him?” Davey asked as we got near the house, and part of me cheered that he’d brought up the first conversation between us about gay people. That was something I knew we’d have to work on if there was to be more between us than friendship or just sex. “Yeah, they know gay people aren’t like some pervert or something.” I said with a shrug. “My uncle was just a man who happened to like other men. That didn’t mean he was going to go all pervo on me.” “No, that’s something people like my father do.” Davey said bitterly and I felt guilty for a moment. “No, don’t say you’re sorry, Brian, it’s just… I’ve never thought about it like that before. My father would have a shit-fit if he thought about me being around someone like that. Hell for that matter so would the rest of my family.” “What do you think about it?” I asked him and he gave me a long look. “You obviously aren’t freaked out about people like that.” Davey said softly. “No, I’m not.” I said with a shrug. “It’s a fact of life, either you are that way or you’re not. It’s just, with Uncle Rich, it was a part of who he was, but it wasn’t all of who he was. You know what I mean?” “I think so.” Davey said with a frown as we walked up the driveway and into the house. Mom and Dad were already gone and Davey looked at me as we stood in the entryway of the house. He wanted to say something, but he hesitated. “Don’t get this the wrong way, but what if like, oh yeah, maybe like what if you had a brother and he turned out to be… gay? How would your parents react?” “Dude, my parents told me when I was twelve that if I liked boys instead of girls they were fine with that as long as I loved them and treated them right.” I said with a laugh. “Oh.” Davey said with wide eyes and shake of his head. “I’m going to take a shower, okay?” “Okay.” I said. “I’ll order the pizza?” “Uh, sure.” Davey said. “How’s pepperoni and sausage?” I asked. “Sounds good.” He said and headed off into the bathroom. I found I was humming to myself as I looked up the pizza company in the yellow pages. It was an old song for me, but a song that hadn’t come out until well after 2010. While trying to find the pizza company I liked, I realized how much I missed things like the internet and instant access to information. There were other things I missed too, like On the Border restaurants and big bookstores, but so far, there was one thing I didn’t miss. He was in my bathroom taking a shower right now. That evening we ate pizza, played chess, and talked. We weren’t interested in going out for anything, so we stayed in and we talked. Davey talked about Nevada, and the things he’d done there, and I could hear in his voice how much he missed playing football. It was obvious that he hadn’t gone out for the football team at Downey last September because he was afraid of failing to make the team as much as because he needed to work. It wasn’t all him talking though, and I found myself walking a fine line between my memories of my original timeline and the experiences of this timeline’s Brian. It wasn’t easy, but by the time midnight rolled around, we were both ready for bed, and I felt like we’d made a lot of progress in getting to know each other. “Thanks for everything.” Davey said quietly before rushing in to give me a hug when we were heading towards the bedroom. I returned the hug, and he blushed before heading into the guest bedroom. Part of me wanted to invite him to spend the night in my room again, but there was a look in his eyes that told me he liked the idea of staying in a room by himself. Mom and Dad returned sometime after midnight, and I woke up just enough to realize it was them coming home before rolling over and going back to sleep. I was up a little after seven in the morning, and I was slightly surprised to see Davey up as well. He’d told me how he liked to sleep in on weekends, and in that he wasn’t that different than the Davey I had known. “You going running this morning?” Davey asked me softly since my parents were still asleep. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt since it was slightly chilly, and he probably mistook that for meaning I was going running. There was a look in his eyes like he wanted the answer to be yes, so I changed my plan of fixing a bowl of cereal into a plan for going running. “Sure, you want to join me?” I asked him and he smiled. “I’m not sure if I want to, but I know I should.” He said with a low chuckle. “Last night proved that I need to exercise more.” “Cool, let me get you a sweatshirt.” I said as I turned to go back in my room. He was wearing the sweatpants from last night, so he was fine there, and I saw he had my old pair of running shoes on as well. “Dude, I’m borrowing so many of your clothes it’s like a good thing we’re so close in size.” He said and I chuckled. “Anytime you want to borrow something of mine, you just take it.” I told him and he blushed slightly as I threw him a green sweatshirt and he pulled it on over his head. “I don’t think I’ve ever known someone close enough to my sizes to share clothes like this.” Davey said. “It’s kind of weird.” “It’s kind of cool.” I responded. “I’ve never really known someone my size either. Brandon’s close to my height, but he’s skinny as a reed.” “Yeah, he is.” Davey agreed with a hint of sourness. We stretched without too much chatter, and this morning I let him set the pace. It started off slow, but he picked it up as we finished the three-mile run, and while he was breathing heavily, he was also smiling broadly. The adult part of me knew it was because he’d set a goal and completed it successfully. Davey liked achieving goals in his life, but he usually set them so high there was no way he could achieve them, and that failure would make him feel depressed. During the morning, my father drafted the two of us to help him clean up a lot of the clutter they’d cleared out of the guest bedroom, and to help him rearrange the stuff in the garage. After a bunch of talk, my weight equipment was moved to the back patio to make room for more of mom’s stuff in the garage. Being included in the task of helping move things relaxed Davey as he felt like he was helping to ‘work off’ what he felt he owed my father. After lunch I dropped him off at work before returning home. It was time for the third degree of questioning from both Dad and Mom as they wanted to know everything they could get out of me about Davey. They both liked him a lot, and the more I shared, the more they grew to look worried about him, and at the same time a bit hopeful. “I wish we could adopt him.” Mom said softly before looking at me. “You wouldn’t mind that, would you Brian?” “He’s got his own family, even if they’re all messed up right now.” Dad reminded her. “It’s more like he just needs a safe place to be himself. We can do that, certainly. Plus, I’ll drop by the apartment in S.F. when his mom’s having surgery. I’ll be able to chat with his grandmother then and get more perspective on everything. From what you said, Brian, she at least understands some of how this might be hard on David and want to help in any way she can. Plus, I’ll probably see Pete in the bank and we can talk about that fishing trip. I wasn’t sure what to think about him, but you seem certain he’s got David’s best interests at heart.” “He’s reacting the only way he really knows how, trying to keep Davey out of trouble.” I hadn’t flat out told them about Davey’s admission of drug use, but they’d taken the hints. Drugs was something guaranteed to get them upset, but at the same time, they were also smart enough to know that if Davey was willing to tell me about it, he was willing to at least listen to someone talking to him about stopping it. “What’s the real story with his car?” I asked dad, who frowned at me. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, dad, I know it won’t take a few days for the starter to come in.” I said and he smiled with a shake of his head. “I should have known you’d have figured that out.” He replied. “I’m having that front fender fixed from where it was all bent up. Do you know how that happened?” “Yeah, he was following someone too closely and reacted too late when they stopped in front of him.” I answered. “It was late and he’d been working a couple of shifts at a couple of restaurants.” “He works too hard for minimum wage.” Dad said. “I know he actually makes about a dollar above minimum wage.” I said with a shrug. “That’s still too little for working so much.” Mom frowned as she spoke her mind. “Can’t he get a better job?” “It was the first job he got offered.” I said with a shrug, having put together a couple of pieces of that story from our conversation last night. “I think he’s really scared of rejection, and he took the first thing that came along so he wouldn’t have to face rejection from somewhere else, and that’s why he’s not really interested in looking for other work.” “Does he have any other skills?” Mom asked with concern. “Do you know if he can type or anything like that?” “Yeah, he can type.” I answered. “He told me he took typing classes in Nevada and at Ceres High and passed the proficiency test with a typing speed of forty-five words per minute. They also taught filing and stuff like that.” “Then why doesn’t he try to get a job in an office?” Mom asked. “Probably because most of those types of jobs are during the day, not evenings and weekends like fast food.” Dad answered. “He might make more per hour doing that work, but he won’t have as many hours and that means he’ll make less overall.” “I hadn’t thought about that.” Mom stated. “I just want to thank you both for being so nice to him.” I said quietly and Dad shook his head while Mom smiled. “We’ve been lucky with you, overall, Brian.” Dad said. “Actually, we’ve been lucky all our lives, and I don’t think I could live with myself if we didn’t help someone like David when the situation presented itself to us.” “I guess we’re just old-fashioned liberals at heart.” Mom said with a fond smile for Dad, and I tried not to imagine where the smile might lead. After Davey got off work, he and I went out to dinner at a Lyon’s restaurant before I took him back to his grandmother’s. He was happier than I’d seen him in a while, and spent most of dinner telling me about some crazy customers that had come through his restaurant that day. It was an enjoyable evening, and I was sorry he was going back home, but I could also see the worried look in his eyes when he mentioned his mother. Monta insisted that I come in when she saw us pull up. She was outside with her great-granddaughter, Whitney, who was now just over a year old. Shantill was apparently out on a date, but Jenny was there, as was Davey’s mother. Jenny was far different than the girl I’d known in the last timeline. She was a little plumper, and lacked the drive and determination that had led her to being a fighter pilot and eventually the commanding general of an entire Air Force base. She’d retired after being the first female general to sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and very nearly being the first female Chair of that important military agency. That didn’t mean she wasn’t lively and interesting, just that it was in a far different way. She was more interested in gossip and what I’d call ‘girlie’ things than in flying or military life, and she definitely expressed an interest in me that made me uncomfortable on several levels. Davey just rolled his eyes at her a couple of times while we all chatted for about an hour. When I got home, I was surprised to see Trevor’s truck outside, and him waiting inside for me. “Trevor stopped by about an hour ago to see you.” Mom said by way of introduction as I came in and I looked at my friend with a little trepidation. Why was he here? “How about we go out back?” Trevor asked and I nodded in agreement before leading the way out into the back yard. He stood there, hands in his pockets and looked around for a bit before speaking. “You moved your weights out here.” “Yes, now what do you want?” I said sharply, more sharply than I intended and he winced slightly. “Dude, can’t I just come by and say hi to my friend?” Trevor asked defensively. “We’ve been friends forever, dude, and you gotta know I miss you.” “Yeah, well I figured you decided your girlfriend’s more important.” I said with a shrug. “Dude, don’t go there.” He said angrily. “What about your little boyfriend?” “He’s just my friend.” I said quickly. “According to Marcie she saw you guys together Friday night.” Trevor said with a leer and I felt my temper rise. “Yeah that was just before she started giving Mark Spencer a blow job in his car.” I sneered and he looked at me with wide eyes. “So that’s why he did it.” Trevor whispered. “Did what?” I asked, knowing what he probably meant. “He’s the one who slashed Jones’s tires for her.” Trevor said. “That’s why I came by here, to tell you that.” “Why?” I asked. “She was pissed when she saw you hanging out around him.” Trevor said softly. “Marcie thinks that if she can keep anyone from hanging out around you that you’ll beg her to take you back and so she’s sending a message to anyone who’d be your friend.” “Thanks, but that’s not what I meant.” I replied. “I already figured that part out, what I meant was why are you here telling me all this?” “We’ve been friends for years, Brian.” Trevor said softly, not meeting my eyes but looking out over the back yard. “I’m starting to think no girl’s worth destroying our friendship over.” “It’d have been nice for you to figure that out earlier.” I said angrily and instantly regretted those words. “I’m sorry, Trevor, that wasn’t fair. I’ve been as bad a friend over the past year from what it sounds like. You know, we use to have a better idea about what was important in life.” “Yeah, we did until we started really dating.” Trevor said with a sigh. “Is that what the future holds? We meet some girl, marry her and lose all of our old friends?” “It doesn’t have to be that way.” I said from the experience of actually having lived a life where I kept in touch with my old friends. We’d all been there, together, that day that the plane had slammed into the Pentagon despite Davey’s efforts, and we’d all been in the same room together when the last American troops left Iraq in 2007, and when war had broken out in 2009 following the assassination of the Iraqi Prime Minister, we’d all watched as Congress voted to send our troops back over there, and we’d all joined Trevor in celebrating his Super Bowl victory in 2011. “I don’t want it that way.” Trevor said after a long moment of quiet thinking. He turned back to look me in the eyes before holding out his hand. “Friends again?” “Always.” I said, taking his hand and shaking it firmly. “So how’s David doing with his car?” Trevor asked in a much easier tone and I relaxed as I told him how my father was fixing the car up. He shook his head, and we talked in earnest for several hours out there on the porch. It was a good beginning. Chapter 9 Monday morning I picked Davey up early, before anyone else in his grandmother’s house was even awake, and we ran around the track at the school. By the time we were done, the gym was opened and Coach Cole nodded at us as we came in for a shower. Davey was exhausted, but once again completing the run had left him in a good mood. We hit the cafeteria for breakfast, and I noticed him choosing much the same food that I did, staying away from the high cholesterol, greasy stuff that he might have normally eaten. Since he didn’t have to work that afternoon, he stayed around school while I went to baseball practice. I could see him sitting there on the bleachers, sneaking looks at the guys on the team in their practice gear, and smiled to myself since I was the recipient of most of those looks. Mark Spencer was spending most of the practice ignoring me until sliding practice where he tried to swipe my leg with his cleats. Coach Anders spotted his attempt and sent him running laps for the rest of practice with a threat that if he did it again, he’d be suspended from the team for a week. “Yo, Breckenridge, I hear that Jones guy over there is bobbing your knob now.” Adam Mitchell, another junior on the team who also played football said to me in a low voice as we stood near the dugout while the sliding drills continued. “If he was, it’d be better than that bitch Marcie.” I said forcefully and Mitchell burst out in laughter, nearly doubling over. “Yo, Jones, why don’t you do something useful instead of sitting there?” Coach Anders called out to Davey a few minutes later and Davey looked up with curiosity. “Get over here.” Davey complied, getting up and putting away the book he’d been reading. Anders gave him the clipboard he’d been making notes on and then had Davey following him around, scribing notes on the clipboard about the performance of different members of the team. That left a smile on my face, and I wondered again at how the staff at a school with over two thousand students still found time to do little things like Anders was doing. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, Spencer?” Anders’s voice boomed out near the end of practice and I looked up from where I’d just slid into second base before the tag to see Spencer caught red-handed rifling through Davey’s backpack. Davey had left it on the bleachers where he’d been sitting, and Spencer was halfway through tearing some pages out of the book Davey had been reading. Davey stood next to the coach with a look of anger on his face. “I…uh…” Spencer stammered but the Coach cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Get your stupid ass into my office and wait for me there.” Anders growled. “Everyone, twenty laps and practice is over. Jones, make sure they all complete their laps and then help Riley get the equipment put up before meeting me in my office. I want to talk to you too.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said weakly, glaring at Spencer. “Oh, and make sure nothing’s missing from your backpack and give me the details of anything Spencer damaged.” Anders ordered before walking away, following the path a sullen Mark Spencer was taking to the gym and the coach’s office. I gave Davey a sympathetic look that he shrugged off before joining the team to make the laps. “That was plain wrong.” Adam Mitchell said as he jogged near me. Trevor was further back in the bunch, and Brandon was lagging behind all of us when several people made a point of speeding up to keep from being beside him. It seemed the team knew damn well where the battle lines were being drawn between Marcie and I, and while people didn’t exactly flock around me, they knew Brandon was on ‘her’ side right now and were shunning him. The few times I glimpsed his face, it looked like he was deep in thought. “Which part?” I asked Adam after staying quiet for a moment. His statement could have gone both ways. “Spencer going through his backpack.” Adam said softly. “I heard your ex-girlfriend bragging at lunch about how Spencer slashed that Jones guy’s tires over the weekend and now this. She’s fucking wacko. Dude, you know I was just teasing you about the fag shit, right? I mean, no one really believes the shit she’s talking about. Most people know she’s pissed you dumped her ass for being a slut and she’s just trying to get back at you.” “Don’t worry about it, dude.” I said with a shrug. “So, Jones, he’s a pretty cool guy?” Adam asked a lap later. Trevor and a few other teammates were now running with us. “We knew him in junior high at La Loma.” Trevor answered before I could say anything. “He’s a bit geeky but not bad. He played on the freshman team before he moved to Nevada.” “I heard his dad’s a pervert.” Rich, another of our teammates said derisively. “It was in the papers how his old man was porkin’ Jones’s sister.” “Don’t even fucking joke about that shit.” Tim, another of our teammates said with a disgusted sound in his voice. “Imagine if that was your sister.” “I don’t have a sister.” Rich said defensively. “You do have a brother, don’t you?” Tim shot back. “Don’t fucking even suggest that shit.” Rich’s voice filled with anger. “Now imagine what it must be like for Jones.” I said softly, gathering everyone’s attention, and after another lap that passed by in silence, Rich spoke up again. “How does he stand it?” Rich asked quietly. “Do you think Jones will help Riley and Coach out for the season?” Tim asked me in the silence that followed Rich’s comment. “Probably not.” I said with a shake of my head. “He works a lot you know. I’m giving him a ride for now until his car’s fixed and he was only here today because he had the day off. His mom and sister need the money bad. His mom, she’s getting ready for a major surgery in a week or two, and his sister’s going to therapy that he has to pay for since no one else can.” “Dude, he pays for all that shit?” Rich asked with surprise. “Why don’t someone else pay, like his father or the state?” “Who’d hire his father after he was in the news so much?” I snorted. “His mother can’t work, at least until after the surgery because of her back and the state’s dicking her around on disability. Someone has to pay for that stuff, and so he works his ass off.” “Dude, that’s so unfair.” Tim said quietly. “Fuck, how’s he paying to fix his car with all those bills?” “Dad’s paying for it.” I said with a shrug. “He’s lucky to have you for a friend.” Trevor said with a hint of bitterness in his voice. I guessed the bitterness was for his having taken Marcie’s side of everything at first. “More like I’m lucky to have him for a friend.” I replied. “Why’s that?” Rich asked quietly. “He likes to play sports.” I said quietly. “At his last school he played football, basketball, track, just about every sport they offered, and he was on the debate team and a whole bunch of other stuff. The guy’s smart, and he’s had to give all that up so he can earn enough money to pay his sister’s psychologist’s bills. How many of us would give up everything we wanted to help our family out? That’s loyalty, and he gives the same loyalty to friends, too.” “Oh.” Rich said, and we finished the rest of our laps in relative silence. Davey was already inside the gym as I entered with the rest of the team. There was no sign of Mark Spencer, but Davey was in with Coach Anders while I got undressed and showered. By the time I was clean and dressed in my street clothes, there was another commotion and we all turned to see Coach Cole leading a red-faced Mark Spencer into the gym. He had Spencer’s right arm bent behind his back and had the angriest look on his face I’d ever seen before. “Breckenridge, get in the office now!” Cole roared and I jumped to obey, stuffing my dirty practice uniform into my bag before leaving the bag on the bench and double-timing to the office. “What’s he done now?” Coach Anders asked as I entered the office and shut the door behind me. The rest of the team was trying to hear what was going on without looking like it, but Cole crossed the room to close the blinds. He’d dumped Mark into one of the chairs where Mark was glowering at Davey and I in turn. Davey’s shoulders were hunched up, and he was looking at the floor. “I found him taking a key to Breckenridge’s car.” Cole growled angrily before looking at me. “Sorry, Breckenridge, you’ve got a couple of good scratches that are going to require the car to be repainted probably.” “You son of a bitch.” I growled, turning angrily to Spencer. “Watch your language, Breckenridge.” Coach Anders growled at me. “That’s five laps you owe me tomorrow before practice.” “Yes, coach.” I said, turning my anger down to a hard simmer. “Spencer, what part of me sending you to the Principal as punishment for what you’d already done didn’t you understand?” Coach Anders asked of Spencer who just shrugged his shoulders while staring at his hand. “Do you understand what has to happen now?” “Borsch already suspended me for two days and I have to pay that faggot back for the stupid book.” Spencer said sullenly. “You can count on another trip to Principal’s office for that.” Anders growled. “What, you give Breckenridge a couple of laps and send me to the Principal?” Spencer sneered. “That’s really fair.” “Breckenridge is on the team, you’re not.” Anders said sternly. “What?” Spencer’s voice almost cracked in his surprise. “Since when?” “Since Coach Cole found you keying Breckenridge’s car.” Anders retorted. “I won’t have a vandal on my team.” “That’s fucking great.” Spencer murmured, glaring daggers at Davey and then at me. “You’ll pay for this, both of you.” “Actually, it’s you who’ll pay.” Cole said angrily. “We’ll be calling the police here in a few minutes for them to come and take our statements and photograph the evidence of what you did. Breckenridge here is going to press charges, so there’ll be criminal charges, and you’ll have to pay for the damage you caused.” “Like fucking hell I will.” Spencer growled. “I’ll pay for slashing the fag’s tires before I’ll pay for Breckenridge’s car.” “What?” Anders growled with wide eyes as he sat up a bit straighter. Spencer realized he’d said too much, and kept his mouth shut. “What’s he talking about, Jones?” “The tires were slashed on my car over the weekend, Coach.” Davey explained in a voice that was tightly controlled. He was glaring at Spencer and flexing his hands like he wanted to hit the guy. “We were pretty sure it was him who did it, and a couple of people have told me they heard Marcie bragging about him doing it, but you know, that’s all hearsay. Now he’s admitted it front of me. Can you please call the cops? I want to file charges for that too.” “We all heard him, Jones.” Cole said sternly. “Brian, you think the shop that’s working on the car threw the tires out?” Davey asked. “We’ll find out.” I assured him and he nodded, and this time it was he who glared daggers at Spencer, who was now looking fairly pale. Most of the team had left by the time that the police finished, and while they weren’t sure if they could get charges to stick over Davey’s tires, they were quite certain they could get a conviction for the keying of my car, even though it was only a misdemeanor vandalism charge, and he’d likely get only a few hours of community service. The important part was that his father was called in by the police, as was my father. No one could reach Davey’s mother, who was in the Bay Area having tests done, but his grandfather showed up, ready to spit nails. The look of shock on Davey’s face as his grandfather took up Davey’s side and threatened Mr. Spencer with lawsuits and the ‘almighty judgment of the Lord God on your worthless son’ was a sight to see, and I think for the first time in a long time, Davey realized his grandfather really did care for him. “Davey, I’ll give you a ride home.” Pete said as we stood outside looking at my car. “Brian, I’m sorry this had to happen to your handsome car.” “I’m just glad we know who did it and he’ll be paying the price for what he did to not only my car but Davey’s car as well.” I said and Pete nodded. “Davey, this one here’s a good guy.” Pete said with a jerk of his thumb towards me. “You keep him close and we’ll see about changing some things around the house.” “Thanks, Mr. Barrow.” I said quietly and he snorted. “Call me Pete, son.” He said as he held out his hand and I shook it firmly. “Now, let’s get a move on, Davey. Mr. Breckenridge, you’ve got a fine son there, and I appreciate all the help you’ve given my grandson. As soon as his car’s fixed, you bring me the bill.” “Thank you.” Dad said with a nod, although the look in his eyes said Pete would be a long time waiting for that bill. “Brian, you want to get your car to a shop and see about an estimate?” “Let’s wait for Davey’s car to get fixed.” I suggested and Dad nodded. “I’ve got to get back to work.” Dad said. “I’ll see you at dinner?” “Yep.” I said and smiled at him as thanks for his support and help. Finding Trevor waiting for me on the front porch of the house wasn’t a surprise, but Brandon being there with him was a surprise. Mom wasn’t home yet, so they’d waited on the porch for me. When they saw me approach, they both stood up, although Brandon had his hands in his pants pockets and didn’t really meet my gaze. “Hey guys.” I said as lightly as I could and Trevor smiled half-heartedly while Brandon scuffed a foot on the sidewalk. I unlocked the door and they followed me into the house were we stood in the living room. “You want something to drink?” “I’m sorry.” Brandon said softly as an answer, and he lifted his head up to meet my eyes, ready to flinch but he didn’t see any anger there. He took a deep breath as he met my gaze and continued. “I haven’t been a good friend. Marcie’s crazy, and she got our girlfriends to give us ultimatums. I should have known better than to cave to her.” “I forgive you.” I said immediately and held out my hand. He sighed with relief and took it quickly. “So does this mean we’re all three single again?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with a grin. “I got a call as soon as I got home demanding to know what I was going to do to help Marcie and Mark get back at you and Davey and I told her it was over.” “I did too.” Brandon said softly. “Dude, there’s something you need to know, too.” “What’s that?” I asked as a little knot of worry filled my gut. “Marcie, she had me follow you and Davey the other day.” Brandon said with a guilty look on his face. “She knows he doesn’t live in the district and she’s thinking of going to Principal Borsch and getting Davey in trouble. That’s what they wanted me to do, go with them and tell him I’ve seen where Davey really lives. She thinks that’ll get him kicked out of school. She had Mark check earlier today. He’s got a friend who works in the attendance office and he got in Davey’s record and figured out that the address on Davey’s record isn’t where he lives.” “You’re serious.” I said with a frown. Marcie had ammunition now, and if she used it, there wasn’t much we could do about that, not without some help at least. “Yeah, I’m sorry I helped her out.” Brandon said. “Tell that to Davey.” I snapped and he winced. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have snapped like that.” “I deserve it.” Brandon said. “What happened with Spencer? I saw what he did to your car, and so did most of the team. A couple of the guys were wanting to hunt him down and beat the shit out of him.” “He’s being taken care of.” I said with a smile, and related the afternoon’s events to them, or at least what they didn’t already know. “Whew, he’s going to be in a world of shit.” Trevor said with a chuckle. “His father ain’t exactly the most understanding of guys.” “You can say that again.” Brandon laughed. “So, tell us the truth, you and Davey?” “We’re good friends, almost as good friends as I was with the two of you.” I said pointedly and they both nodded slowly. “You mean as good friends as we are again.” Trevor countered. “We’ll see.” I replied and they both nodded with acceptance of that. “So, you two are going to look for new girlfriends?” I asked and Brandon shook his head. “You know, I think I’ll stay single for a bit.” Brandon said with a shrug. “I will too, besides there’s always the barn.” Trevor said with a wink towards Brandon who blushed a bit before smiling. I turned away, not really ready to deal with this yet from my friends. How could they flip-flop so easily between denying they ever did anything with guys and then be this open? “Brian, you want to join us?” “Um, no thanks.” I said with a blush and they laughed. “Well, we’ll like see you tomorrow at school, right?” Brandon asked, and I realized they were really going to be going to Trevor’s barn right now! Jesus they were… teenagers. “Yeah, see you guys at school.” I assured them and then I winked. “Don’t have too much fun in that barn.” “We will.” Trevor said before leading the way out. The phone rang before the door had even finished shutting behind them and I went to answer it before the machine picked up the call. The fact that it was a crank call with heavy breathing and threats on the other end didn’t surprise me. The way they hung up when I mentioned that the police were monitoring all calls to the house in light of recent events ended the call rather quickly. There was homework to do, and a list of chores from my mother that kept me busy for most of the afternoon. I even put my practice uniform in the wash and it was almost dry by the time she got home. Apparently she’d already heard about my day from Dad, and wanted to hear more details, which I gave to her as she started dinner. Davey’s upcoming problem with his residence was in the back of my mind, and the obvious solution was something I wanted to approach carefully, so I didn’t tell her about that yet. Over dinner, Dad had more to say about the day’s events, and he informed me that he’d hired an attorney to represent me and Davey both in a civil suit against Spencer’s and Marcie’s parents. He never really expected to see any money out of them, but he wanted the suit on record, because it would be a permanent record against not only their parents but against Marcie and Spencer. “Dad, there’s another problem you should know about as well.” I said calmly after dinner was over and Dad had finished his dialogue about how Marcie and Spencer were being dealt with. “What is it?” Dad asked just as calmly. “Brandon and Trevor came over after I got back today.” I said and Mom smiled. “You guys have made up?” She asked. “Yes.” I answered and she smiled broadly. “I told you it was just a matter of time.” She reminded me. “You were right, but Brandon had some disturbing news.” I continued. “Dad, you see, we know Davey doesn’t live in the district for Downey, but he also didn’t receive a legitimate transfer. A friend of his mother’s who does live in the district has been letting them use her address on Davey’s record.” “Marcie somehow figured this out?” Dad asked. “Yeah, she had Brandon follow us over the weekend.” I said. “So she’s reported it to the District?” Mom asked and I nodded. “If they investigate they’ll figure it out and send Davey back to Ceres.” Dad said shortly. “You know, that is where he should be going to school if he lives there.” “He’s miserable there, dad.” I responded. “He was fairly miserable at Downey too.” Dad replied. “Was being the key word there.” I pointed out and he nodded. “What do you expect me to do about this?” Dad asked me point-blank. “Expect?” I said. “I don’t expect anything, but I was hoping we might be able to help Davey come up with some alternatives to having to switch schools just when things are starting to look up for him here.” “You mean besides the crap Marcie’s pulling?” Mom said scornfully. “I hate to say it, but I don’t know what you ever saw in that girl.” Dad snorted. “I don’t either.” I replied in complete honesty. “Well I think the first thing we should do is call Pete and Davey and maybe get together with them to discuss this.” Dad said. “I agree.” Mom said and I nodded. He got up to leave the room and as soon as he was gone, Mom turned to me. “Brian, have you thought about dating again?” “Nope.” I snorted. “After Marcie, it’s far too early to think about stuff like that.” “Good.” Mom said with a nod of her head that surprised me. “Brian, Pete’s asked us to come by their place.” Dad said as he came back into the room. He was frowning and I got worried. “Davey’s mom was hospitalized by the doctors in San Francisco today. They just found out a little bit ago.” “Oh no.” Mom murmured, and she got up to go get her jacket. “I’m coming as well.” “I’ll get my jacket.” I said as it had gotten chilly outside as soon as the sun had set. The weather reports also called for a light rain tonight. The house was in near-pandemonium when we arrived. Two of Davey’s aunts, Fran and Priscilla were there, as was Davey and his sister, Jenny. Both of them looked really worried, and had food left over on their plates while almost everyone else had finished their food. His cousin Shantill was there, while her mother Fran held Shantill’s daughter in her arms, trying to calm the crying baby. Pete was sitting at the head of the table with a scowl on his face, and he nodded to my father as we entered, and smiled at my mother when Dad introduced her. “Let’s go in the living room.” He said, leading us through the doorway that connected the dining room with the living room. It was paneled in a dark wood, and had an old stereo console that ran the full length of one of the walls. We all sat down in the room, with Pete in one armchair, Davey in another while I sat on the couch with my parents. Pete shut the folding door across the kitchen for more privacy while Fran and Priscilla kept everyone else occupied. When we were all seated, and Priscilla had brought in some glasses of water for us, he spoke again. “I appreciate you folks coming down here like this. Davey’s made some good friends in you and I hate to impose on you any more.” “We’re honored to have Davey as a friend of our son’s.” Dad said. “He’s a fine young man.” “He can be when he puts his mind to the job.” Pete said with a sideways look at Davey who was looking withdrawn. “Monta’s in a fit right now what with Sandy being hospitalized so sudden like.” “Do we know what’s wrong yet?” Dad asked. “All they said was complications from her back.” Pete said sourly. “That girl’s had to deal with too much in her life as it is without this. There’s nothing we can do about that now but pray. Monta said you had a place you were willing to rent to her?” “She insisted on paying rent.” Dad said firmly. “As far as we’re concerned, she’s free to use it anytime without charge.” “We’ll pay for what we use.” Pete said just as firmly. “We do appreciate the use of the place, though. I’m heading up there in a bit to help Monta out. That woman will spend so much time in a tizzy over Sandy that she won’t take care of herself and both of them will end up in the hospital.” “I’ve brought the keys and directions on how to get there from Children’s Hospital.” Dad said, pulling a folded piece of paper and a set of keys from his pocket. He gave them to me and I got up and handed them to Pete. “It’s much appreciated.” Pete said and then he looked over at Davey for a long moment. “Thanks for all the help you’ve been giving me and my family.” Davey said in a way that suggested he’d been told exactly what to say. Despite that, his eyes showed that the sentiment was real. “We’re glad to be of help.” Mom said immediately. “It’s the right thing to do, and I knew if we needed help like this, you and your family wouldn’t hesitate to return the favor.” “I don’t want to have to ask this, but I do have another favor to ask.” Pete said at that point. “Fran and Priscilla will take turns watching out for Shantill and Whitney, and the mother of one of Jenny’s friends has offered to take her in for a week or two until I get back in town. Monta won’t leave that city until Sandy comes home, but there’s no need for me to stay the full time up there. That leaves Davey, and honestly I’d rather he stay with someone else than stay here on his own. Fran could take him in, but she’s going to have enough on her plate without adding Davey to it, and I don’t like that oldest boy of hers. He’ll just draw Davey into more trouble.” “Papa.” Davey started to protest, but quieted at the look on his grandfather’s face. Mom and Dad looked at each other and then at me for a moment before they nodded at each other. “Pete, we’d appreciate it if you’d let Davey stay with us until things settle down here at home.” Dad said. “He and Brian get along well, and he’s proved to be helpful around the house. We’d be honored if you thought it was good for him to stay with us.” “I can help out with his room and board.” Pete said gruffly. “We had a talk tonight and he’s going to quit his job tomorrow. There’s just too damn much stuff going on with this family for him to waste his time working away. He’s already proved he would if he had too, and that’s good enough for me. I’ve told him tonight that as long as he’s getting good grades in school, and doing extra-curricular work, I will pay his car payments, insurance, and cover Jenny’s bills. The coach of the baseball team offered to pay him twenty bucks a week if he worked as an equipment manager for the team, so he’ll have some spending money at least.” “We won’t take a dime, Pete.” Dad said firmly. “He’ll do chores around the house just like Brian and that’ll cover his room and board.” “You sure about that?” Pete asked. “You’ll give him real chores to do?” “Yes.” Dad said firmly, and my stomach did a little flip-flop. Davey was going to be staying at my house full-time now. It made me excited, but at the same time nervous. “Then I’ll not push that.” Pete said sternly. “Mind you, it’s just for a few weeks until we get things settled with Sandy.” “It won’t be a problem even if it goes a bit longer.” Dad said confidently and Mom nodded her agreement. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” Pete said stolidly. “Davey, why don’t you and Brian go pack your stuff for a week, and remember what I told you.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said as he stood up. I stood as well, and followed him into the house entryway and through the kitchen where he was all but tackled by his blond sister. “I can’t believe this is happening.” Jenny cried into his shoulder while their aunts looked on. Shantill was on the phone again, laughing at whatever she was hearing from the person on the other side of the line. It seemed almost cruel for her to be laughing while her cousins were going through a bad time. “It’ll be okay, sis.” Davey said softly, rubbing a hand through her long, blond hair. “I don’t want you to go.” She whined and I felt sorry for her, and felt a bit selfish that I was so happy Davey would be staying with us. “It’s only for a week or two, and my car will be fixed by the weekend, so we can go see her then.” Davey said. “You promise?” She asked hopefully. “What about your work?” “Papa says I don’t have to work anymore.” Davey said with a hint of disbelief in his voice. That brought a smile to my face, because it was something the Pete Barrow I remembered would have done for his grandson. “Really?” Jenny asked. “What about my appointments?” “He’ll take care of them.” Davey said with even more disbelief showing in his voice. “You’ve got Brian’s number, right?” “Yes.” She said. “You’ve got the number to Stacey’s house, right?” “Yep.” Davey agreed with a smile. “I’ll call you every night, okay?” “Okay.” She said and wiped her nose with the back of her hand like I’d seen Davey do over the weekend. It was a cute family trait, one I’d noticed several times before in the other timeline. “Good, now I’ve got to go pack and you should too.” He told her gently. “Stacey’s mom will be here soon.” “Yeah.” She said with a smile and went down the hallway to the bedroom she shared with her mother. I followed Davey down into the family room where he pulled out a suitcase, a duffel bag, and his school backpack before putting clothes in them. “I really appreciate this.” He said to me as I stood and watched him. Part of me wanted to help, but I sensed this was something he wanted to do himself. “You know it’s not a problem.” I told him and he nodded his head while he finished loading his suitcase and bags. When he’d finished, he looked wistfully at his stereo. “You going to bring your stereo?” “You don’t think it’d be a problem?” He asked. “I mean it’s only for a week or two.” “Dude, if you want to bring it, bring it.” I encouraged him and he smiled before moving to disconnect all the wires. It took only one trip for the both of us to load up the trunk of Mom’s car with his stuff, and when we shut the trunk, we turned to find my parents standing there with his grandfather on the sidewalk. “Thank you for everything, Papa.” Davey said and the old man nodded gruffly before pulling Davey into a very quick hug. That was a loud statement of affection from the man who usually only gave handshakes unless it was to a pretty girl. “You just do what we talked about.” Pete said sternly and Davey nodded his agreement. “Let’s get going so we can get you settled in, Davey.” Dad said kindly and turned to shake Pete’s hand before we got into the car. I could see Pete’s smile when Mom hugged him before joining us in the car. It was a slight surprise, but a welcome one when Davey’s hand reached across the back seat to find mine in a tight grip as Dad drove us home. Chapter 10 Hearing a description of something and seeing it unfold in front of you are two totally different things, and no matter how good the description is, sometimes it can’t just relate the full majesty, or horror of an event. I had stood on a slight hill and watched an airliner slam into the Pentagon in a different timeline, but the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger brought tears to my eyes much the same as the events of 9/11 had in that other time. Like most of the other kids in our school, I watched the televisions that had been placed around the school to show the destruction of NASA’s premier vehicle, and the death of seven astronauts. “My god.” Davey whispered in horror from next to me as we watched the event happen in slow motion while a news channel played it over and over again. There was the sound of a few girls weeping in the library, but most of the kids watched it over and over again in stunned silence as commentators explored those final moments over and over again, and threw out theories on what could have gone wrong. “It was the o-rings on the booster, you stupid idiot.” I murmured to the commentator, remembering another of Davey’s explanations, and realized I should have kept my mouth shut when this Davey looked at me with surprise. “What makes you say that?” He asked me. “Just a hunch.” I temporized. “David Jones, please report to the Principal’s office.” A voice said over the loudspeaker, causing a few students to jerk in surprise, and several turned to Davey who looked confused. “I wonder what I’ve done now.” Davey said softly before walking off, leaving me there to chew on my lip nervously. Could Marcie’s little ploy about where he lived have already born fruit or was this fallout from yesterday? Either way, I knew dad needed to know and I found the nearest pay phone to call him at work. “Go to the Principal’s office and wait for me there.” Dad ordered me as soon as I’d told him. “If it’s about yesterday they’ll probably call you, if it’s about his residence, well I think I’ve got what we need to fix that problem.” “Okay.” I said with as much enthusiasm as I could muster and went to the office. The student on duty there, a friend of Marcie’s, gave me a glare but said nothing as I sat down. “Can I help you son?” The older secretary said after she realized the girl wasn’t going to address me. “I’m just waiting for Davey to get done in there.” I said with a nod towards the Principal’s office. “Oh, dear, he’s going to be a while.” She said with a shake of her head. “We need to get his parents in here and we can’t seem to get a hold of his mother at all.” “That’s probably because she’s been hospitalized in San Francisco.” I said quickly and she gave me a questioning look. “You’re a friend of his?” She asked, and I looked at Marcie’s friend with a significant glance and she got my drift. “Why don’t you come back here and tell me how I can get in touch with his parents.” I nodded and got another glare from the girl before sitting down at the woman’s desk. If we talked in low tones, the girl wouldn’t hear what we said. The older secretary smiled at me as I sat. “Now, you say his mother is in the hospital?” “Yes, Children’s Hospital in San Francisco.” I said. “His grandparents are up there too. She was hospitalized yesterday.” “What about his father?” She asked with a frown and then her frown deepened as her eyes widened. “Now that was a stupid question, of course he’s not someone we can call about this. Where is David staying? Certainly they didn’t leave him alone to fend for himself.” “No, he’s staying at my house.” I told her. “I’ve already called my father and he’s on his way in here.” “Oh, that’s a good thing dear.” She said with a genuine smile. “Tell me, how long has he been…” “Brian!” Dad’s voice called out, interrupting her and I looked over to see my father dressed in his business suit and staring down the girl who looked like she’d tried to misdirect him or something. “Ah, you must be Mr. Breckenridge.” The secretary said as she stood up. As much as I couldn’t really remember her name, she apparently knew me just fine. She walked over to the counter and smiled at my dad. “Your son was just helping me figure out how to get in touch with a responsible adult for Mr. Jones.” “Yes, well that would be me.” Dad said with authority filling his voice. He handed over a piece of paper that I could see had been notarized. “This is of course a fax copy, but you’ll see that Sandy Jones, mother of one David Jones, Jr., has granted temporary guardianship of David Jones Jr. to my wife and me. As he’ll be staying with us for an indefinite period of time depending on the outcome of her surgery, I had planned to file this with the school. Now, I’d like to know why my ward has been called into the office of the Principal.” “This appears to be in order, although a certified copy should be filed as soon as you have one.” The secretary said as she looked over the document. “How long do you think this arrangement will last? When is Mrs. Jones expected to be back home?” “It’ll be at least a month, if not longer.” Dad said quickly. “My wife and I have told her to worry about getting her strength back fully before worrying about David. As far as we’re concerned, he’ll be living at our home at least through the end of the semester.” “I see.” She said with a wide smile that told both my father and I that she was quite aware of what he was doing. “I take it you do know why Mr. Jones was called into the office and why we’re trying to get in touch with his family?” “I’m not sure I understand what you mean.” Father said ingenuously and she smiled even more. “Well, why don’t you follow me and I’ll introduce you to the Principal.” She said. “I’ve met him before.” Dad said. “Yes, that’s right.” She smiled. “Brian, why don’t you have a seat? Davey should be out shortly.” I went and sat down, and within a couple of minutes Davey shuffled out of the office while my father stayed behind, talking to Principal Borsch. Davey’s shoulders were slumped and he barely looked up as he slouched in his seat next to me. The bitch behind the counter smirked at him until she saw my glare. “How did they find out?” Davey murmured softly. “They’re going to ship me back to Ceres unless Mr. B can do something.” “I wouldn’t worry too much about that.” I said confidently “As for how they found out, I give you one guess.” “You know, sometimes I wonder if being your friend is a curse or blessing.” Davey muttered, but the corners of his lips quirked and I knew he was joking, or at least mostly joking. “She’ll pay for this.” I said firmly and he started to laugh softly. “She already has.” Davey said insightfully. “She’s doing this to try and win you back, but all she’s doing is guaranteeing you’ll never give her the time of day again. As long as I can still go to school here, that’s fine with me.” “We’ll make sure that happens.” I said, and since we’d really had no chance to talk about last night, I decided to ask him another question. “What was up with your grandfather last night? Why’s he making you quit?” “I don’t think you heard him and Coach Cole talking yesterday.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Papa won’t say what Cole said to him, but when we got home he asked me some real tough questions. I can’t believe it, but I told him the truth, even when he asked me about drinking and drugs. That’s when he told me I had to quit my job. He told me I’d proven I’d work to support a family but that I should have time to be a kid instead of having to grow up just because my old man was a loser. That hurt, but I don’t think he meant to insult me that time. He asked me what I did in school back in Nevada instead of drinking and doing drugs, and when I told him about being in sports and other stuff, he told me that was what he wanted me to do. Coach Cole told him they wanted me to help with the baseball team, doing equipment manager stuff with Riley and helping the coaches. Then he wants me to try out for football in the fall.” “That’ll be good.” I said with a smile as a happy feeling washed over me. This was what Davey’s high school life was supposed to be like. “Yeah, and I have to go fishing and camping with him over the summer.” Davey said with a snort. “We never caught a fish when I was a kid and went with him.” “It’s not catching the fish that’s the point.” I told Davey. “It’s going and being in the company of the other person, even if you never say anything.” “You sound like you’ve gone fishing with him.” Davey snorted. “Maybe I have, in a weird kind of way.” I said and he gave me an odd look before shrugging. “Well, anyway, I don’t rightly like giving up work.” Davey said with a sigh. “Janice says I have a chance at making Assistant Manager when I turn eighteen next year and that’s good money.” “College gets you better money.” I said. “If you can afford it.” Davey snorted. “There are always scholarships.” I reminded him. “If you’re willing to take hand-outs.” He said derisively. “They’re not hand-outs, you have to earn them.” I pointed out and he gave me a weird look. “Look, you can’t get a scholarship with bad grades, or for any number of reasons. You have to earn them, it’s just usually academic or other work around school or the community that helps you earn them. They aren’t handouts.” “That’s what you think.” Davey said sourly, but he was at least thinking about what I said, I was sure, as Dad came out of the Principal’s office. He turned to shake the man’s hand one more time before walking around the counter and stopping in front of us. “David, Brian, why don’t you walk me to the car.” He said and we stood up to follow him out. Once we were out of the building he let out a sigh. “Davey, I don’t like lying. It almost always comes back and bites you in the ass, but I’ve skirted the line today for you. Pete got your mom to sign a Limited Guardianship for you. It names me as your temporary Guardian until your mother rescinds it after she’s recovered. What that means is that I’m legally obligated to care for you as if you were my son until she says otherwise.” “Thank you, Mr. B.” Davey said in a barely audible voice. His shoulders were slumped again and Dad looked sharply at him. “What that means, Davey, is what we talked about a little last night after we got back to the house.” Dad continued. “I expect you to obey the rules we set out for you, to tell us if something is wrong or you need help, to let us know where you are and not to make any long trips without getting our approval first, and that does include going to see your mother, but I also promise we will make sure you have time and gas to go see her as much as possible. The only real difference this document makes is that now it’s a legal relationship. Don’t think it means your mother isn’t still your mother. As soon as she’s better all she has to do is say she’s rescinding the guardianship and it’s gone. What it does mean, and what’s especially important given the fact that the school now knows you really did not live in the district, is that your legal residence is now our house, inside the Downey District, until and unless your mother rescinds the guardianship.” “You mean… you mean I won’t be forced to go to Ceres?” Davey said with a sigh of relief. “That’s what it means for now.” Dad said with a smile. “Now, more than likely it’ll last just fine for the rest of this semester, but next year you’ll either have to be still living with us or your mother will have to live in the district. “That’s fine, at least for now it’s not a threat.” Davey said happily, and he hugged my father quickly. “Thanks, Mr. B.” “I’m glad I thought of it in time.” Dad said before getting into his car. “I’ll see you boys at dinner.” “Bye, dad.” I said before he pulled off, and Davey was grinning at me. “So does this mean we’re temporary brothers?” Davey asked with a giggle and I felt a moment of horror. Did that mean he and I getting together would be incest? No, and if it did, who cares? “Just be careful, Davey.” I warned him and he frowned. “You know what they say about brothers and incest being best.” “Ewe, gross.” He said, mock-gagging with a finger down his throat. We both laughed as we went back into the school. Practice that afternoon was cancelled, although Davey spent a few minutes talking to the coaches about baseball practice. He worked out a deal with them that let him give two weeks notice at work, and when we stopped by the restaurant where he worked primarily, his manager Janice seemed downright happy that he was quitting instead of upset like he expected. They worked out a deal where he’d have time to work at practice before going to work there for three days this week and two days next week. He tried to offer to work more, but she flat out refused saying they had just hired four more people that week. We’d been home for only a few minutes before Trevor called to say a bunch of guys from the team were meeting up at a nearby field to throw a few balls. It took a little work, but I got Davey to go with me and we went to the field wearing sweats. It almost turned into a disaster. I’d not realized that Davey had almost never played catch in this timeline, when in the last he’d been amazing at baseball. For a worried moment after he dropped the ball for the tenth time, I worried the guys were going to start teasing him, but to my surprise Adam took him to the side while the rest of us continued to toss the ball back and forth. Up until dinner time, Adam worked with him until he was catching just about every other toss that Adam threw him, and doing a decent job tossing the ball back. It wasn’t anywhere good enough to make the team, but it was better than he’d been at the start, and he had a smile on his face as we went home for dinner. That night he talked to one of his aunts on the phone after dinner. The doctors had moved up his mother’s surgery to the end of the week. He’d be able to see her on Saturday, when she should be out of surgery and doing fine. His next call was to his sister, who he talked to for about an hour before making a third call to Todd. I’d barely talked to the red-head in the last week, we’d nodded to each other every time we passed in the hallways. By the time he was off the phone, it was almost bedtime, and he worked furiously at the rest of his homework before going into ‘his’ room and going to sleep. Things were finally starting to come together for both of us, and I slept peacefully that night. Mark Spencer came back to school on Friday, and spent every minute he could staring at us. It made Davey uncomfortable, but we tried to ignore him. Certainly Brandon and Trevor’s presence was helpful to me, although Davey was still a little uncertain around them. I was thinking he was uncomfortable with them on several levels, not just because he’d been intimate with them before, or because they’d at first sided with Marcie, but more a combination of those things. On Friday afternoon, we went to pick up his car. I drove us there, and Dad met us there, a smile on his face as he waited for Davey to see his car. Davey gasped at the first site of the car with its front end repaired, and the car sported a fresh paint job of a dark blue. “You…you shouldn’t have done all this.” Davey said with tears in his eyes while Dad handed him his keys back. “I’ll never be able to repay all this.” “Just don’t scratch the new paint job when you take your sister to see your mother tomorrow.” Dad said with a smile as he lifted the hood to show him the engine. A lot of work had been done there, too, I knew. Dad had spent fifteen hundred dollars on the car, almost as much as Davey’s grandfather had paid to finish the payments due on the car. “Thank you.” Davey said, giving my father another hug. Dad smiled and returned it while Davey turned to me. “C’mon, Brian, let’s go for a drive.” “Don’t forget, you’ll need to give Brian a ride next week while they work on his car.” Dad told Davey who nodded enthusiastically while getting into his car. His excitement was catching and I got into the passenger seat next to him. “Will do.” Davey told dad before starting up the car and listening to it purr a bit before backing out into the parking lot. “Where you want to go?” “How about a milkshake?” I asked and he laughed. “I thought I was supposed to get rid of my stomach, not make it bigger.” He joked. He was starting to lose weight already. “A little cheating won’t hurt at this point.” I suggested and he nodded. Our choice of Denny’s proved to be disastrous. Unfortunately we didn’t realize that until after we’d sat down and ordered. Marcie came in, draped over Spencer’s arms, along with a gaggle of girls and other guys. “Oh dear, maybe we don’t want to eat here.” Marcie said in a sneer. “We might catch who knows what from those two fags over there.” “Let’s just go.” Mark Spencer said with a glare at us. “They might tell their folks we’re picking on them again and try to get us arrested.” “I think you need to leave.” The shift manager said as he walked up to them and Marcie glared at him before tossing her hair and walking out. The shift manager, a thin man in his early thirties looked over at us but didn’t say anything. We were just finishing up when a woman who’d just paid her bill came rushing back inside. “Does someone have a really dark blue Pontiac parked in the lot?” She asked just as we were getting out of the booth. Davey looked sick suddenly and I felt an urge to start swearing. “It’s mine.” Davey said and she came over towards us. “What’s wrong?” “I’m sorry young man, but a car just drove through the lot and a bunch of kids threw eggs at it.” She said in a huff. “They almost hit my car! What’d you do to get them mad at you?” “I exist.” Davey said miserably and looked at me for a nod before rushing outside. I paid the bill and went to join him in looking at the car. Anger warred with tears on his face as he looked at the car and my heart went out to him. “There’s a car wash just down the street.” I said. “I’ll pay.” “No, you and your family have done enough.” Davey said angrily. “They’re going to fucking pay for this.” “Let it go, Davey.” I urged him gently. “They’re not worth this.” “I don’t fucking deserve this!” He grated angrily. “They’re going to learn to not fuck with me!” “Don’t do something stupid.” I said sharply and he glared at me before taking a deep breath. “Why not?” He asked in a slightly calmer voice. “You really think they’re going to get in trouble for this?” “Spencer’s already off the team, and there was another guy on the team with him when they came into the restaurant.” I reminded Davey. “We can make them pay, but let’s do it the smart way, okay?’ “How’s that?” Davey asked and smirked. “Let’s just think about it for a while and make some plans, okay?” I suggested and he nodded sullenly. “For now, let’s hit the car wash before that egg stains the new paint.” “Okay.” Davey agreed reluctantly. That Saturday he returned from seeing his mother with a worried expression, but he also seemed relieved the first surgery was over. She’d be in the hospital for another three weeks before they did the next one to finish the work, and then she’d be there for another six weeks. It was longer than they’d expected, but the doctors said it would be better this way. Pete came back the next day, but there wasn’t even a hint that Davey should move back there. Dad had told Pete about the fact that Downey had almost sent Davey back to Ceres, and Pete didn’t want that to happen any more than Davey did. He knew damn well that Davey had gotten mixed in with a bad crowd there and didn’t want it to happen again. Twice over the next two weeks Davey or I came back out into the parking lot after school and found our cars had been defaced. Fortunately the damage wasn’t permanent or didn’t require more than a bit of touch-up, but Dad went into the Principal’s office with us following behind him and read the Principal the riot act. Borsch was a good man, and when he found out what was going on he took action. Unfortunately, no one was willing to come forward and admit they’d seen what had happened, but on the Tuesday after the President’s day holiday, two security guards caught Mark Spencer and a friend of his attempting to splatter pink paint over my Mustang. That was really bad news for Mark, who was supposed to go to court the next day on the original charges of vandalizing my car. It was also a reason for Principal Borsch to suspend him for a full week this time, and to tell him one more time and he’d be expelled from school. The other kid, a sophomore, got a three-day suspension. Marcie got caught up in it this time, because the police were able to track down a statement by Mark and prove that she’d bought the paint for them. That meant she was now going to face charges of her own. With him facing new charges, Mark begged for a deal from the DA and they rolled both charges together and he got six months probation along with two hundred hours of community service. Davey’s desire for revenge wasn’t exactly fulfilled, but he let it go after we’d learned of Mark’s punishment. The next day, it was all over school that he’d dumped Marcie, who immediately tried to replace him with a guy from the football team, but he told her to get real. For the next two weeks, she got more and more frustrated as guy after guy turned her down. By the time March came around, she was extremely upset that almost all her friends had deserted her. Our baseball season got off to a slow start, but by the first week of March we were on our way to a decent season. If we played our cards right, we might make the division playoffs. With Davey on the team in the last timeline, we’d clinched the playoffs early on, but this time Davey stayed in the dugout helping make sure we had plenty of Gatorade, or making sure everyone’s favorite bat was ready, or keeping the stats for the coaches who preferred to just watch the action than actually write things down. As the days and weeks flew by, I realized that I really did love this Davey Jones on his own terms, and not just because of the man I’d spent my life with in the last timeline. This Davey was a lot rougher around the edges, but he had the same quick wit, the same sense of humor, and the low but urgent drive to prove himself in anything he did. My original Davey had tried to say he didn’t have to prove himself to the world, but the truth was he’d constantly worked to prove himself even if he didn’t realize what he was doing. Dad left his job at the bank in mid-February and started with his new firm. At night he’d sit in the dining room and cuss as he tried to type up his handwritten notes. After the first two nights, Davey had quietly gotten up and offered to help him, taking over the typewriter. His fingers flew over the keys, and Dad’s memos came out letter-perfect. Davey was officially hired to help dad out for two hours per night, and a few hours on the weekend at a rate of pay that bordered on scandalous, although it really was the same rate that they were paying a clerk in the Bay Area. Davey had tried refusing money for an ‘allowance’, but he couldn’t refuse the offer of pay when Dad insisted this time. Two or three times a week he’d go to his grandparent’s house and have dinner with his grandfather, his sister, and whatever other family was there. I went with him a couple of times, but he went alone mostly. Trevor and Brandon came by more, working out with us a few times and other times just hanging around. Mom had taken Davey on two shopping trips, and although he tried to stop her from buying him clothes, and stuff for ‘his’ bedroom, she walked all over him and got her way. Things were going so smoothly right up until Darlene, who was in a class with both of us, asked Davey out on a date. For a moment, I thought he was going to accept, but he declined her offer politely, claiming that while his mother was in the hospital he didn’t want to start dating because he couldn’t give a girl the attention she deserved. Oh yes, he could be smooth when he wanted. As his mother went through her second surgery, and struggled to recover from what was obviously a painful ordeal, Davey came into my room late at night, and crawled wordlessly into my bed. He wanted, no needed, a shoulder to cry on, and as I’d told him I would be, I was there for him, letting him pour out his grief and holding him tightly. We woke the next morning, spooned together, and my body ached for more than the emotional closeness we were experiencing, but I kept that desire under control. I wasn’t blind to the looks he gave me from time to time, the looks of desire when he thought I didn’t see him. It wasn’t something he showed any inclination to talk about though, and the few times I tried to bring up the topic of gay people, he shut down completely. In mid-March, we had a game against a team from Hughson at their field, and we rode with the team on a bus down to the small town just south of Modesto. We won the game easily, and there was a lot of celebration on the bus ride back. Davey sat next to me near the middle of the bus, we talked all the way back to the school where most of the team went into the locker room to change. Not Davey and I though, because we joined Trevor and Brandon in heading to Trevor’s house where his parents were gone for the weekend. Brandon, Trevor and I were still wearing our game uniforms, dark blue shirts with gray pants and blue stirrups while Davey wore his team shirt and a pair of jeans. The rest of the team was changing into their clothes and going to dinner, but we’d basically snuck out so we could celebrate with a bottle of champagne that Trevor had procured and hidden in the loft of his barn. A little voice in my head was warning me that something might happen, given the looks Brandon and Trevor had been sharing most of the bus ride back to Modesto, and the looks Davey had been sending my way, and with plenty of alcohol and no dinner, that little voice was a shout that I tried not to listen to right then. “Dude, you so have to play football next year.” Trevor was saying to Davey when we’d finished most of the bottle. Davey and I were leaning against the rough wood of the barn wall, our legs splayed out in front of us, and his right leg was almost touching my left. The buzz of the champagne filled my head and I put my arm around his shoulders. He leaned into me with a sigh, and his hand landed on my leg, which he squeezed through the uniform pants I was wearing. My shoes had long since been kicked off, as had everyone else’s. Across from Davey and I, Brandon and Trevor were leaning against a hay bail and each other in poses similar to us. Brandon noticed Davey’s hand and smiled as Trevor finished the champagne and threw the empty bottle between us. “I’m not that good.” Davey demurred. “You have to at least try.” Brandon asserted with a slight slur. “We’ll help you practice over the summer, won’t we Brian?” “Yeah, we will.” I agreed and looked sideways at Davey. Most of the stomach he’d had was gone now, thanks to our regular running and workout on the weights at home, as well as P.E. “Okay, I think it’s time for true confessions.” Trevor murmured a few moments later. “What’s that?” Davey asked, trying to sit up straighter, and pushing down on my leg as he struggled to brace himself. I was getting hard at the contact with him, and my pants were tenting up a bit in front. “It’s time we all lay our deepest secrets to bare.” Trevor giggled and leaned into Brandon. I was surprised when their lips locked and they kissed deeply. “Oh fuck.” Davey said with wide eyes, and he took his hand off my leg to cover his crotch. This wasn’t exactly how I imagined this happening, but part of me had begun to wonder if maybe I wasn’t being a bit too obsessive about making my first time with Davey so ‘special’. “You should put your hand back where it was.” I whispered into Davey’s ear, leaning in closer to him. “It felt good there.” “Brian, don’t.” Davey almost whimpered as he turned to face me. There was a look of fear in his eyes, and we both tuned out Trevor and Brandon to look at each other. “Why not?” I asked, lifting a finger to run along his jawline. “Like Trevor said, it’s time for true confessions. You’ve done it before, haven’t you? With a guy?” “Don’t.” Davey whispered as tears formed in his eyes. “I can’t… you won’t… it’s all too perfect. I knew it had to end.” “What can’t you do?” I asked him. “I can’t just fucking do it with you the way I did with them.” He said with a jerk of his head to Brandon and Trevor where Brandon was pulling Trevor’s hard cock out of his uniform pants and going down on him. “Why not?” I asked him softly, ignoring my two friends who seemed to find a renewed attraction to each other after dumping their girlfriends. “Because I don’t want sex with you.” He said and looked away as my heart plummeted into the depths of my abdomen. How could he not be attracted to me? “You don’t think I’m good looking?” I asked him in wounded pride. “It’s not that.” Davey said with a sigh and he looked back at me. “I can’t be gay, what would my grandfather think? Or my mother?” “They’ll get over it in time.” I said with a slight shrug. “They love you Davey, and they’ll learn to accept that part of you as well, eventually. I won’t lie, it won’t be easy, but they will. Trust me.” “I do trust you.” He said and he leaned his forehead into me so that his was touching mine, and his hand reached out to rub along my leg. His body shivered as he did that, and mine did as well at the touch. “The problem is, I think I love you, Brian, and I can’t just have sex with you and pretend it never happened.” “Good.” I said so intently that he jerked his head back to stare at me with wide, surprised eyes. “Good?” He asked in confusion. “Yeah, it’s good.” I said in a husky voice and leaned in to kiss him. When he tried to pull his head back, my hand reached up and pulled his head towards me. As our lips met and my tongue teased against his lips, he let out a whimper that turned into a moan and as his mouth opened and my tongue snaked in against his, he moved quickly to pull me down with him until he was flat on his back amongst the hay on the floor, and I was laying on top of him. His hands roamed over my butt, kneading it and grasping it with passion while his tongue caressed mine oh so gently. I could feel his hard cock pushing out against mine, and moaned when he pulled his lips away from mine. There was a passion burning in his eyes and I smiled at the look of desire in there. “Why the fuck is it good, Brian?” Davey whispered forcefully as his eyes burned with fear and passion both at the same time. “Why the fuck is it good that I love you and I want to be with you the way two men can’t be, like normal people, get married?” “Because I love you too, Davey.” I said with a fierce passion burning in my throat and stinging tears into my eyes. “I don’t care what society or the church says, I want to spend my life with you, just you, forever. Do you hear that? I don’t care what anyone else says, just what you say and what I say, that’s all that really fucking matters. I want you.” “God forgive me.” Davey whimpered as he closed his eyes, and when he opened them they shined in a sky blue color that spoke of his love for me, and our lips tingled with electricity when they met again. “Holy fuck, I’m gonna cum just watching that.” Trevor’s voice was husky, and barely registered on my mind as Davey’s hands began undoing my belt buckle. It was much later that night before we stumbled back into the house. My gray pants had hay stuck in them, as did Davey’s hair, and we were both glad that the parents were already in bed. This time, when Davey stripped my uniform off of me, he did it slowly, as if he was unwrapping a precious and fragile present, and we explored each other for the third time that night, and the first time in my bed. Before, in that other time, we’d gone slowly, building up to the first time we had anal intercourse with each other, but this time I was buried deep in him on that first night, there in my bed. He whimpered and moaned in pleasure as I used all my decades of experience to prove to him I was the best lover he could ever imagine having. By the time we fell asleep, with me still buried inside of him and my bed a total mess, with a room that reeked of sex, the sun had begun to climb above the horizon. “Good morning.” I said a few hours later when Davey opened his eyes. I’d pulled out of him when I’d woken, and spent the minutes watching his face. His eyes held a hint of fear in them, until I leaned forward and kissed his lips softly. “Oh thank god.” Davey said softly. “It wasn’t a dream?” “You mean us telling each other that we love each other and fucking like rabbits?” I asked and he blushed before shyly nodding. “Nope, not a dream. Just remember you’re mine now. Don’t think you can get away just because I haven’t put a ring on this finger.” “We shouldn’t do this.” Davey whispered. “It’s wrong. What will your parents say?” “They’ll say it’s about time I showed some maturity and picked a good person to spend the rest of my life with.” I said fiercely and he gulped. “You mean that?” He asked. “I mean, my parents said they’d be there forever, and look what happened to them?” “My parents are still together, so let’s base our relationship on them, okay?” I asked and he looked at me for a long moment before nodding. “I’m scared.” He said with a shiver and held me tight against him. I was sore down there, but already getting erect again at the touch of him against me. “I am too, but we’ll get through this together, okay?” I asked and he nodded. “Brian, is Davey in there with you?” Dad asked as he knocked on the door. Davey looked scared shitless and tried to grab the blanket so he could hide under it, but given the way the room smelled of sex, if Dad opened the door it would be hopeless. “Yeah, he is.” I called out. “Oh good, by the way, you should really come out here.” Dad said with an edge to his voice. “There’s a message on the answering machine you should listen to real soon. If Davey’s asleep still, let him sleep it off.” “We’ll be out in just a minute.” I called out and waited until he’d moved off before getting out of bed and getting dressed quickly. What could the message be about? Brandon had stayed over at Trevor’s last night. Was it something else, or just someone from the team? “Dude, you look good in those.” I said when I realized Davey had pulled on my game pants from last night. He blushed and pulled them off, picking up a pair of gray sweatpants he’d mistaken the uniform for being. I had to push the sight out of my mind as I was wearing a blue pair of sweatpants and my erection was painfully obvious. It didn’t go down, though, until Davey came in and pulled the front of my sweatpants down to engulf the erection in his throat. All it took was for me to hit the back of his throat and my body jerked in an orgasm as I pulled roughly on his hair. He stood back up with a smile, gave my lips a quick peck and sauntered out the door, claiming the bathroom while I panted and stared after him while the sounds of his pissing could be faintly heard. With a shake of my head I went to the kitchen where Mom pointed to the answering machine without saying a word. She looked pissed, and I knew the call was something bad. While I hesitated with my finger over the play button, a grinning Davey came into the kitchen and got a glass before going to the fridge to pour a glass of orange juice. Mom glared at me again and motioned once more to the machine, and I pushed the button. When the machine began to play, I groaned at the sounds of female weeping. ‘Bbbrrr…Brian, this is Marcie.” She blubbered and I resisted the urge to hit delete. “We need to talk. I’m pregnant and it’s yours.” Davey’s glass shattering on the floor was a sound that reverberated through my mind as I felt my life crashing down around me. Chapter 11 “We should have an attorney here for this.” I muttered as I picked at the tie I was wearing. It was later in the afternoon on Sunday. Davey had left to go visit his grandfather and his sister as soon as he could leave. He hadn’t spoken to me at all, and I saw the hurt look on his face, like he’d been betrayed, and part of me understood that feeling in him. My parents and I had sat down for a heavy conversation after which Dad had called Marcie’s father, who had spent the first part of the conversation yelling at my father before agreeing to come over with his wife and daughter. Now we were all dressed up, waiting for them to arrive. Dad had dressed in his business suit, and I was wearing a dress shirt and tie as well as slacks while mom was wearing a similar suit to Dad’s except with a skirt. There had been some actual arguing, but I’d won the right to lead the conversation once they were here and sitting down, while Dad had won that we’d face them as a family first, without an attorney. This was a serious situation, all of us knew, and not something to be taken lightly. “Brian, we all agreed that we’ll start this like civilized people without resorting to attorneys.” Dad said and I bristled at the unspoken implication attorneys weren’t civilized. I’d been an attorney for most of my adult life, albeit I hadn’t practiced family law, ever. It would have been nice to consult some legal books for case histories, but there wasn’t access to any at this time. “I know.” I said anxiously as there was the sound of a car pulling up. When they rang the doorbell, and dad opened it, I knew this wasn’t going to be a fun exercise. Marcie was dressed to the hilt with a tight dress that showed off her bosom, a diamond necklace and earrings that were probably the ones that my other self had bought for her before I came back in time. She showed a firm expression on her face. Her father looked like he was going to hit me before he nodded at my father. He was wearing jeans and a flannel shirt while Marcie’s mother was wearing a simple but nice dress. “Mr. and Mrs. Ellsworth, please come in.” Dad said politely. “Would you like some tea, juice, or maybe some water?” Mom asked politely and all three of them shook their heads as Dad led us into the dining room. Marcie tried to reach out to grab my arm but I quickened my pace a bit so she couldn’t reach me without being too obvious. Dad sat down at the head of the table with Mr. Ellsworth at the other end. Mom sat on Dad’s right and I sat on his left. Marcie started to cross down to sit next to me before her father glared at her and she shifted to sit on the same side of the table as me but next to him. “Your son has gone and gotten my daughter pregnant, Breckenridge.” Mr. Ellsworth spat the words out like gunfire from a machine gun. “I want to know what you’re going to do about it.” “I’m going to listen to what my son has to say, and what your daughter has to say as well.” Dad said in a firm, even tone and Ellsworth bristled at that while his wife looked slightly uncomfortable. Ellsworth was a big bear of a man with dark bushy hair and a bushy beard while she was much smaller, although slightly plump and had mousy brown hair. How Marcie had gotten her looks from them I wasn’t quite sure, but some of her attitude could be explained by her father’s bearish manner. Then again, this was the first time that I had ever met the man. “What is there to say?” Ellsworth demanded harshly. “He got her pregnant and now he has to do the right thing. That’s all there is to say.” “How far along is the pregnancy according to the doctor?” I asked in a neutral tone, drawing their eyes to me and I noticed how Marcie squirmed. “She hasn’t been to a doctor yet.” Mr. Ellsworth fumed. “We can’t afford the bill. You’ll have to pay for this.” “If she is pregnant, and if the child is mine, then yes I’ll be responsible for her pre-natal related medical expenses.” I said, ignoring the looks of faint surprise on the faces of my mother and father and focusing on the outrage on Mr. Ellsworth’s face. “A woman knows if she’s pregnant!” Mrs. Ellsworth spoke up for the first time looking at me with angry indignation while her husband roared. “What do you mean if it’s yours? Of course it’s yours!” “With all due respect to you as a mother, Mrs. Ellsworth, your daughter has proven herself to be a lying and manipulative young women with no hint of a conscience or morals.” I said and ignored Mr. Ellsworth’s roar of anger and his slapping the table before demanding an apology from me. “Mr. Ellsworth, calm down before you become the second member of your family to have the police called after attempting to damage the property of me and my family.” “What are you talking about?” Mrs. Ellsworth asked as her husband’s face turned purple and my dad looked at me with surprise and worry. “Don’t tell me you don’t know your daughter was arrested for trying to vandalize my car.” I asked with a lift of my eyebrow. “She told me that was just a misunderstanding.” She said with a frown. “It was just a joke that got out of hand.” “Ma’am, with all due respect, your daughter lied to you.” I said. “I did not!” Marcie cried out. “I just got a little overwrought and you got upset. You told me you loved me and would spend the rest of your life with me and then you changed and dropped me and now I’m pregnant with your baby!” “You may be pregnant, with a child that may not be mine.” I said coldly and she started to cry, drawing an angry look at me from her father who put an arm around her. “Who else would it be?” He demanded angrily. “Let’s see, Marcie has bragged at school about having slept with Mark Spencer after she broke up with me, and I saw her giving fellatio to him in his car so that’s a real possibility.” I said casually and Marcie shouted her innocence while her dad roared at me that I was lying. “Then, of course, while she was dating him, she told her friend she was also sleeping with Chad Kipple. Then my friends have told me that even while she was dating me she cheated on me with two other guys, neither of whom attend our high school.” “You liar!” Mr. Ellsworth roared, pointing a meaty finger at me. “You deflowered her, stole her virginity. She told me that herself! She’s never been in a serious relationship with anyone but you!” “Mr. Ellsworth, if there is one thing I’m certain of it is that your daughter has never had a serious relationship with anyone or anything, and most especially she’s not even a passing acquaintance of the truth. She’s a natural-born liar.” “How dare you!” Marcie wailed. “This is all the fault of that creep you’ve been hanging around, the one who convinced you to break up with me.” “Can you not tell the truth even now?” I asked with scorn in my voice. “Or have you really forgotten that you dumped me and told me I’d have to come crawling on my knees to get you back.” “I did not!” She exclaimed before burying her face in her heads and shaking her shoulders with what I was sure were fake sobs. “Now look at what you’ve done!” Mrs. Ellsworth wailed while getting up and going around to her daughter and pulling her in tightly so that Marcie buried her face against her mother’s bosom while Mrs. Ellsworth glared at me. “And to think I thought you were such a nice boy!” “To think I thought your daughter cared about anyone or anything other than herself.” I snorted and my dad touched my arm in a warning gesture. “Be that as it may, here is what I am prepared to offer. First off, we’ll set up a trust account to cover any pre-natal bills if the child is proven to be mine. Second, if and only if a paternity test comes back positive that I’m the father, we will arrange child support payments until the child is eighteen, if she is granted custody of the child by the courts.” “What do you mean if the child is yours?” Marcie’s father demanded. “It can’t be anyone’s but yours.” “We’ll see when the paternity test is done.” I said firmly. “Brian, just marry me and we won’t have to worry about any of this.” Marcie said as she pulled her face out of mother’s bosom. “You said you loved me, why won’t you just marry me?” “If I ever loved you, what you’ve done since January has cured me of that forever.” I said to her coldly and she let out a wail. “I wouldn’t want a little piece of shit like you as a son-in-law anyway.” Mr. Ellsworth snarled as he stood up. “You’ll be hearing from our attorney.” “You’ll be hearing from ours as well.” My father said as he also stood up. “It’ll start with a lawsuit requiring your daughter to submit to an exam by a qualified physician to determine if your daughter really is pregnant. Then it’ll require a paternity test, and you better pray Brian is the father, because if he isn’t, we’ll sue you for libel and defamation of character and take every damn penny you have.” “Oh yeah, well you’ll be sorry your family ever crossed paths with mine!” Ellsworth roared before bustling his daughter and wife out of the house. Dad followed them and Mom let out a long breath while shaking her head. “Brian, I wish you’d never gotten involved with that girl.” She said softly and I chortled softly. “So do I, Mom, so do I.” I agreed with her fervently. “Brian, I don’t know what you think you were doing, but calling a man’s daughter a slut to his face does not make you friends.” Dad said as he reentered the room and sat down. “Dad, I knew that if Marcie’s parents were anything like her, giving them an inch would have been as good as giving them the whole game.” I said. “Do you think the child’s yours?” Dad asked and I shrugged. “I sure as hell hope not.” I said. “I promise one thing though, nothing like this will ever happen again.” “I sure hope not.” Dad said and he gave me a long look. He took a swallow as if he was nervous and I realized he had probably figured me and Davey out. “I’d much rather have Davey as part of the family than anyone like that.” “So would I, Dad.” I said as Mom watched me for my reaction. There was nervousness in my gut, but they both nodded slowly. “You might want to open a window next time he spends the night in your room.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Yeah.” I agreed with a blush of my cheeks. “So, is this… thing with him serious?” Dad asked. “Have you two actually… talked? How long has it been going on?” “It’s very serious, at least on my part and I’m pretty sure on his as well.” I said softly. “He’s probably hurting right now from all this other stuff, I think that’s why he left like that. We’ve talked a little, but not enough, and as for how long, last night was the first time.” “I’ve always said you were a lot like your Uncle Rich.” Mom said with a shake of her head and a penetrating look at me. “Is that why you were with that… that girl? You were still upset over Uncle Rich and didn’t want to be like him.” “You really do know me.” I said with a sad smile and she nodded. “I can understand that, son, but you can see what a mess this is.” Dad said with a sad shake of his head. “Don’t get me wrong, we’ll always love you, but you have to know we’re disappointed in you over this whole mess, and you’ve hurt Davey. I’m not sure you and him… getting to know each other better at this point was necessarily a good thing.” “The timing could be better, but that’s par for the course.” I said with a shrug remembering all the times that life had intruded on my life with Davey. Something moved into place inside of me and I knew it was time to tell all my secrets, or nearly all of them. “Mom, Dad, we need to talk, about a couple of things, not just this, but I’d like Davey to be there. He’s an important part of my life.” “When he gets back, or tomorrow evening after school we can all talk.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “Until then, how about we stick our heads in the sand?” “That sounds good to me.” Mom said with a sigh of her own and I nodded my agreement. I didn’t quite ignore things the rest of the day, since I called both Brandon and Trevor to tell them what was going on with Marcie. Both of them were outraged, and promised to support me if I needed their help. That helped a bit, that they were sticking by me now. It was hard to admit to myself that I had missed them as much as I really had. Davey never came home that night. He did call to tell Mom that he’d be staying over at his grandparents. Mom tried to get him to promise to come over after school, but he backed away from that commitment. It hurt, but I had faith that we’d manage to work through this problem like any other I’d ever experienced with Davey. All night I tossed and turned, thinking about things and how to explain them to him, and to my parents. When dawn came, I’d slept very little and got up in a tired state that not even a shower and a short morning run could quite solve. Even as I pulled into the parking lot it felt like everyone was staring at me and whispering behind their hands. Had Marcie shouted it from the hilltops that I’d gotten her pregnant? I was surprised when I walked between a row of classrooms and the gym to find someone waiting for me. Katie looked nervous, and kept on looking around as if to make sure no one saw her talking to me.",

      "content": "“If he hadn’t done this to Jenny then poor Davey wouldn’t have to live like this.” Monta was saying and I winced slightly. “Oh yes, it’s all his fault.” Davey’s voice dripped sarcasm and anger and I tried to look away so I wouldn’t see the look of hurt on his mother’s face.“It’s not like he was the one who told me we were going on a vacation for a few days when we were really leaving forever and didn’t even give me the chance to say goodbye to my friends.” “David Ray Jones Jr., how dare you say that?” His grandmother fumed. “Your mother did the right thing getting you away from that beast of a man!I should have made her do it years ago when I saw him beat you.” “He didn’t beat me.” Davey shot back angrily and I wondered if there was anything I could say to calm this situation down. It made me decidedly uncomfortable to be stuck like this, torn between the hurt I knew Davey felt and the pain I saw in the eyes of the two women.There was nothing I needed to do, though, as the sound of a baby crying came from the back of the house. “Now look what you’ve done!” Davey’s mother complained as Monta got up and hurried back into the house, muttering about Davey waking up the baby. “Then maybe it’s good I’ll be gone until tomorrow at least.” Davey said sourly.His face did soften as his mother looked hurt, though.“I love you, Mom.” “I love you too, Davey.” His mother said softly and the look of hurt faded a bit from her face. “It was nice to meet you, ma’am.” I said softly, and she returned my smile briefly before nodding. “Let’s get going.” Davey said in a voice that was so conflicted with emotion that I couldn’t quite place all of them. I followed him out of the house and we got into the car before I drove off, heading back up to Modesto. He was silent and brooding again, but now it was about things other than his car. As much as I wanted to comfort him, I also knew that a part of the problem was more than his family’s actions towards him, but his reactions to the situation they were in, and I would have to think about that.Anyone in his situation would be torn and conflicted, as he obviously was, and I wondered how best to help him.Well, being a good friend was always a good start to any situation like this, and I would always be the best friend any Davey Jones could ask for in life. Chapter 8 While Davey and I spent most of the afternoon working on our history project, Mom and Dad spent the time cleaning out the guest bedroom. The Davey I had known had a hundred years or more of life experiences behind his argumentation skills, but this Davey was just seventeen and showed the diamond in the rough that would become his debating skills later in life. He had some good theories, and we spent most of the time hashing them out. When they paused for lunch, my parents seemed to enjoy listening to Davey and I argue about different ideas for our project. While the discussion grew a little heated at times, Davey seemed happier than he’d been in a while as he focused on something besides the troubles in his life. I understood it was a respite for him, and I wanted to make the most of it for him. “Boys, why don’t you take a break?” My father suggested as we approached dinner time. It was starting to get dark outside and I hadn’t realized so much time had passed. “Brenda and I were thinking of having an adult’s night out, going out to dinner and a movie. Would you like to tag along or do your own thing?” “Has there been any word on my car?” Davey asked with a touch of nervousness. “None since earlier this afternoon.” Dad answered. “They said then it might take a few days to get the parts they needed. I hoped you don’t mind, but Janice came out for a smoke before the tow-truck left and she mentioned to me that you aren’t scheduled for work on Monday or Tuesday.” “That’s right.” Davey said with a frown. “I don’t mind taking you around town and I won’t miss practice since you don’t have to work.” I spoke up immediately and my dad smiled at me. “If you want to make things easier and stay here, the guest room is ready for you.” Dad suggested calmly. “I know it’ll make things easier for Brian, and I imagine with how crowded your grandparents’ house sounds, it won’t be a bad thing for them either.” “I’ll call mom and ask.” Davey said softly. “I’m worried about her; she didn’t look that good this morning.” “She’s going to be fine, Davey.” Dad said reassuringly, and I was surprised to see how Davey’s shoulders slumped in relief a bit. His reaction to my father was different than his reaction to the adults in his family, and I wondered how much the whole mess with his own father was a part of their angry interactions with each other. “Give her a call though. Right now she needs to worry about her own health first and foremost. Let her know you’re doing fine and it’ll help.” “If you say so, Mr. B.” Davey said softly and got up to go use the phone. Dad looked over at me with a look of concern on his face. I’d had a few moments earlier in the day to tell him about what I’d seen at Davey’s ‘home’ during our visit this morning. Davey had been in the bathroom, and that had given me just enough time to share the highlights with Dad. My father had been shocked hearing my description of Davey’s ‘bed’ and while we both knew it was better than being on the street, the total lack of privacy Davey had to live with was shocking to us. “Order a pizza if you guys stay in, okay?” Dad asked and I nodded. “Thank you for doing all this dad.” I said quietly. “I know it’s not like he’s been a family friend for a while or anything, but I really appreciate how much you’re helping him out.” “He’s a good guy.” Dad said softly. “I’d only hope that if you ever were in a situation like his that someone else would do what we’re doing for you. It sounds like his family has a lot of issues to work through, and while they are doing that, they can’t really pay him the attention he needs. We can, and we will.” “Thanks.” I said again and he nodded before heading out to go talk with Mom. Davey came back a moment later with a frown on his face. “What’s wrong?” I asked him and he sighed. “Just Mom being a mom.” He answered cryptically and I let it go at that. “I’m tired of working on the project. How about we do something else?” “I could use a run.” I said and he frowned. “You making another reference to my stomach?” He said defensively and I realized I should have said something else with him already feeling defensive from his conversation with his mother. “No.” I said with a shrug. “I just know that when I’m feeling uptight I like to work out. It helps me, so I thought it might help you.” “It’s better than having a cigarette, I guess.” He said with a shrug and I grimaced. “Yeah, it is.” I agreed with him. “I didn’t bring any running clothes.” He said and I stood up to lead the way to my bedroom. “Don’t worry, we’re the same shoe size and I have an old pair of running shoes and some sweats you can wear.” I assured him. “Jeez, it’s like you’re trying to make me dress all preppy like you.” He said, but there was a hint of humor in his voice. “Well, we’ve got to have you looking your best if you’re going to be my best friend.” I said as we entered my bedroom and I realized he’d stopped in the doorway, looking at me hard. “I thought you already had a best friend.” He said softly, but there was a glistening look in his eyes that sent chills down my spine. “They seem to be more interested in kissing Marcie’s ass instead of being friends with me.” I said with a shrug. “You’re not going to do that, are you? I mean even if she slashes your tires again?” “She can blow up my car and I won’t walk away.” Davey said softly with gleaming eyes locked on mine. “You and your family are the best thing to happen to me in a long time.” “Good, we feel the same way about you.” I said. “Why?” Davey asked and I smiled gently. “You just told me why.” I replied. “You said she could blow up your car, and dude, I know how important a car is to a guy our age, and she wouldn’t be able to keep you from being my friend. Her and I break up, and I find out who my true friends are, and you’re here. That means a lot to me, you know.” “It means a lot what your folks are doing for me, too.” Davey reiterated and I nodded. “So, now we know another part of why we’re friends and you don’t have to doubt why you’re welcome here.” I said with a shrug. “Now let’s get ready for a run.” “Okay.” Davey said with a bit of a grin on his face. We got dressed, and I couldn’t help notice the sly looks he was giving me. I posed when I noticed the looks, and wondered if he realized that I was posing, but didn’t care. Our friendship was developing just fine, and as much as my body was crying for more as I put on my jock, I knew that it would come eventually. He didn’t have his own jock, and for a moment I considered offering one of my spares, but realized that would probably be a little too awkward just now. The only problem with just having the idea though was that I was fully hard at the thought, and suddenly didn’t want him noticing that. I finished getting dressed in a pair of blue Downey sweats and a black t-shirt while he wore a pair of my old blue sweats from freshman year and a yellow t-shirt. “Let’s stretch.” I said when we were dressed and he had finished putting on a pair of my old running shoes. He let out a little sigh at the comfort of them and I felt guilty again at how threadbare his wardrobe was. Come to think of it, the nicest clothes I’d seen him in lately had been those my mother had bought him as a belated birthday gift. A half-mile into the run, he was wheezing something bad, and I was astonished at how out of shape he was. The Davey I’d known would have set double the pace and not even broken into a sweat for the first mile at this age. How much had he been smoking? “Oh god, it’s been so long since I went for a run.” Davey moaned as we slowed to a fast walk and he tried to catch his breath. “How long has it been?” I asked him. “Over a year, since we moved from Nevada.” Davey explained. “That’s bad.” I said with a frown and he nodded. “Let’s pick up the pace.” He said in a determined tone that was very familiar, and very welcome. He had a half-smile on his face as we started jogging, albeit slower than before. “I use to run a lot back in Nevada.” Davey said with a slight wheeze after another half-mile. He was sweating profusely now, but he seemed determined to go on for at least a little more. “I use to do a lot of things in Nevada, for that matter.” “Why’d you stop?” I asked and he shrugged as we finished another half mile and he motioned for us to turn back. Three miles wasn’t exactly a lot, but for his first time out in a year, it was pretty damn good. “A lot of reasons.” Davey wheezed after we’d gone for a bit in silence. I slowed to a walk, and he followed my change of pace, lifting his arms over his head and stretching out while taking deep, steady breaths. We kept moving though, although the pace was just a rapid walk. “Part of it was just being depressed over the whole sack of shit that my life became.” “What happened?” I asked cautiously, not sure if he’d want to share. “I mean, I know what the papers said, but what happened really, for you?” “It sucked.” Davey answered bitterly. “Mom had been sick for a couple weeks with pneumonia and Nanny had come out to Nevada with Papa to care for her. Nanny now thinks Dad had been poisoning Mom, but I don’t really believe that at all. Anyway, Mom got better and the Saturday before Thanksgiving Mom asked me if I wanted to go with them to California for the holiday. I agreed since we weren’t playing any games at school and it was boring stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Dad was the only one who stayed behind. After Thanksgiving, I started asking when we were going back to Nevada, but Mom kept on putting me off saying she wasn’t feeling well.” “That’s not right.” I said, and while I’d heard parts of the story before, I’d never heard it like this or with the anger and venom in his voice. It also explained some facets of Davey’s psyche that I had never really understood before. “No, it wasn’t.” Davey agreed bitterly and picked the pace back up to a slow jog. “It was December before I learned we weren’t going back to Nevada. At first I threw a fit and demanded that if Mom wanted to divorce Dad, that was fine, but I wanted to live in Nevada.” “She didn’t tell you why?” I asked and he shook his head. “Not until they’d already enrolled me at Ceres High just in time for finals that I had no chance to prepare for.” Davey explained. “I got lucky and did alright and with the grades I’d already gotten in Eureka I eked out B’s in most of my classes, but I’d been getting a 3.8 GPA in Nevada, so all B’s kind of fucked me up there. I got real mad one night and told Mom she could either buy me a bus ticket back to Nevada or she could tell me what was really going on, and so she broke down and told me the truth about what Dad had done to Jenny.” “That must have been rough.” I said softly. “I didn’t believe her at first.” Davey said so softly I almost didn’t hear him, and he stopped jogging to turn and face me. There were tears in his eyes again. “How awful was that, my sister gets fucking raped by my own father and I didn’t fucking believe it when Mom told me! I was so fucking angry and so god-damn self-centered that all I cared about was getting back to Nevada and my fucking friends there. When Mom told me, I lost it, accusing her of lying just to keep me from siding with Dad against her. We were sitting in Nanny and Papa’s bedroom, with the door shut although I could hear Nanny hovering outside. Mom picked up the phone and called Dad right then and there, and put me on the phone without saying a word.” “Oh god.” I said fiercely, not believing the details I was hearing. Davey had never shared them with me before, and I wondered if that had been on purpose because of how painful they had been, or unintentional because they no longer hurt so much. Here, in this timeline, Davey’s eyes were leaking tears and his cheeks were flushed from more than our run. “I asked him right out, expecting to hear him deny it so that I could go back home to Nevada where I belonged.” Davey’s shoulders shook with sobs, but his body language was so angry and defensive I knew he didn’t want a hug or comfort. He wanted somebody to listen. Hearing this was so amazing for me, because it hadn’t been something I’d ever discussed with my Davey in detail, and it was like a door was opening to understanding the man I’d loved for decades. “My whole fucking world came crashing down on that phone call. When I told him what mother claimed, I waited for him to tell me it was all a lie. I was so ready to believe that, but he didn’t. All he did was start crying. My fucking father, who I could never remember crying like that, fucking broke down in sobs on the phone and told me how sorry he was. “FUCK YOU DAD!” Davey yelled into the darkening twilight and I shook with my own unshed tears for him. “How the fuck could he do that to her? But you know what’s the worst thing about it all? It’s not just what my fucking father did to my sister, it’s what my mother did to me! Her and my grandparents, and my sister, and everyone around me. Even Shantill, that fucking nitwit, knew what had happened, but could anyone even fucking tell me? No, they fucking lied to me and put me off like I couldn’t handle the truth! You wonder why I’m so mad at them? I saw the look on your face at Nanny’s, you know. That’s why I’m so fucking mad at them. They couldn’t even fucking tell me the goddamn truth about what my father had done to my sister! I had to force them to tell me!” “They were all wrong.” I said softly and he looked at me with fury and passion burning in his eyes. We were jogging along a canal path, empty at this time of year, and the only lights were from the stars, the rising moon, and cars in the distance. While our eyes remained locked on each other, I stepped towards him, and put my hands on his shoulders as my teary eyes bored into his. “They didn’t respect you, but what are you doing now? You’re working, giving them a lot of your hard-earned money to help, why?” “Because they’re my family and I care.” Davey said with an exhaled breath. “How could I turn my back on my sister after what she’s been through? My mother too. I know she didn’t do right by me, but I know why she did it. It hurt, and she was afraid I’d still go back to him even knowing the truth. It hurts she didn’t trust me, but she’s still my mother and I know she loves me.” “You’re a good guy, Davey Jones.” I said softly and he blushed slightly. “No, don’t be embarrassed. I don’t know many guys would go through what you’ve been through and still care a bit about his family.” “I’m not all that good.” Davey said softly as he looked at the cars in the distance. It was getting chilly out, and the fact that we’d been sweating didn’t help, but neither of us wanted to move at this moment. “You want to know another reason why Papa doesn’t let me in after eleven-thirty? It’s because last year at Ceres I got mixed up with stoners. I’d stay out late with them getting drunk and stoned. It felt good to let go, to forget my problems and drift along all numb to the pain. That’s why they really helped me get into Downey, to get me away from those guys, but it didn’t really work. Most of the money I have left over I spend getting pot for them and me and alcohol for Ronna or Jeannette when I can’t hang around the stoners. So you see, I’m not really a good guy.” “Bullshit.” I snapped angrily, not just at the fact that he was doing drugs and drinking like mad at times. His eyes snapped back to me at the word, and I locked gazes with him. “Good people can make bad decisions without becoming bad themselves.” “Tell it to Mrs. Dent.” He said and I almost lost the reference until I remembered the junior high math teacher who taught positive/negative multiplication with a silly reference to bad things happening to good people being a bad thing, and bad things happening to bad people being a good thing. “Real life is more complicated than that.” I reminded him and he looked at me as if he was longing to hear the next words out of my mouth. “I know it hurts, Davey.” “How could you?” Davey asked angrily as he pulled away from me and crossed his arms to stare at me in his anger. “You’ve got the perfect fucking family, Brian. Your parents, most people would kill to have parents like them. God knows I would sell my soul for parents like them, so what the fuck could you know about hurting?” “I had a favorite uncle.” I said slowly, trying to mix the truth with the reality of this timeline without outright lying to Davey. Building a relationship on a foundation of lies was a bad thing, or should I just tell him the full truth right now? Was he ready for that? “Uncle Rich and I use to do a lot of things together and he was like this god-figure when I was younger. He could do no wrong, and I loved talking to him on the phone, and visiting him.” “Let me guess, he died in an accident or something?” Davey sneered and for a moment I felt really angry at him. “He died of AIDS back in 1981, just after Christmas.” I said softly, and truthfully. Davey’s face contorted in a mix of emotions before he frowned at me. “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “Did he get it through a blood transfusion?” “No, he caught it because his partner liked to sleep around.” I said bitterly and he frowned before his eyes widened. “Don’t you dare say something about ‘fags’ or ‘queers’ either, Davey Jones. He was my uncle and I loved him. He should fucking be alive right now!” “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “That’s not all.” I said fiercely, wanting to make sure he did realize that I could understand hurt and loss. “Every Thanksgiving we usually go see my grandparents back east. This last time, the fucking bitch Marcie decided to have me spend time with her family and like an idiot, I agreed. My grandparents decided to come out here and they fucking died in a car accident on the I-5 in heavy fog, all because I listened to my bitch of a girlfriend.” “Shit.” Davey said and this time he stepped closer to me, and I could feel his hands on my arms as more tears came to my eyes. Yes, it hadn’t been me exactly who had done that, made those decisions, or had watched Uncle Rich die, but in many ways it really had been me and if the choices I had made had not created this timeline, they’d have never happened. Someday I’d tell him that part of all this. “Yeah, shit.” I said bitterly. “So, you know, Davey Jones, my little life isn’t perfect after all. Yes I’ve got damn fucking good parents, but that doesn’t guarantee me a perfect little life.” “I’m sorry.” He said softly. “I got so wrapped up in me that…” “Yeah, well, let’s head home.” I said, turning to wrap my arm around his shoulder and he sagged against me as we began walking back to the house. We walked in silence, but it was a good silence. When we were getting closer to the house, I dropped my arm and we walked next to each other. “Your uncle, your parents knew he was…gay and still let you around him?” Davey asked as we got near the house, and part of me cheered that he’d brought up the first conversation between us about gay people. That was something I knew we’d have to work on if there was to be more between us than friendship or just sex. “Yeah, they know gay people aren’t like some pervert or something.” I said with a shrug. “My uncle was just a man who happened to like other men. That didn’t mean he was going to go all pervo on me.” “No, that’s something people like my father do.” Davey said bitterly and I felt guilty for a moment. “No, don’t say you’re sorry, Brian, it’s just… I’ve never thought about it like that before. My father would have a shit-fit if he thought about me being around someone like that. Hell for that matter so would the rest of my family.” “What do you think about it?” I asked him and he gave me a long look. “You obviously aren’t freaked out about people like that.” Davey said softly. “No, I’m not.” I said with a shrug. “It’s a fact of life, either you are that way or you’re not. It’s just, with Uncle Rich, it was a part of who he was, but it wasn’t all of who he was. You know what I mean?” “I think so.” Davey said with a frown as we walked up the driveway and into the house. Mom and Dad were already gone and Davey looked at me as we stood in the entryway of the house. He wanted to say something, but he hesitated. “Don’t get this the wrong way, but what if like, oh yeah, maybe like what if you had a brother and he turned out to be… gay? How would your parents react?” “Dude, my parents told me when I was twelve that if I liked boys instead of girls they were fine with that as long as I loved them and treated them right.” I said with a laugh. “Oh.” Davey said with wide eyes and shake of his head. “I’m going to take a shower, okay?” “Okay.” I said. “I’ll order the pizza?” “Uh, sure.” Davey said. “How’s pepperoni and sausage?” I asked. “Sounds good.” He said and headed off into the bathroom. I found I was humming to myself as I looked up the pizza company in the yellow pages. It was an old song for me, but a song that hadn’t come out until well after 2010. While trying to find the pizza company I liked, I realized how much I missed things like the internet and instant access to information. There were other things I missed too, like On the Border restaurants and big bookstores, but so far, there was one thing I didn’t miss. He was in my bathroom taking a shower right now. That evening we ate pizza, played chess, and talked. We weren’t interested in going out for anything, so we stayed in and we talked. Davey talked about Nevada, and the things he’d done there, and I could hear in his voice how much he missed playing football. It was obvious that he hadn’t gone out for the football team at Downey last September because he was afraid of failing to make the team as much as because he needed to work. It wasn’t all him talking though, and I found myself walking a fine line between my memories of my original timeline and the experiences of this timeline’s Brian. It wasn’t easy, but by the time midnight rolled around, we were both ready for bed, and I felt like we’d made a lot of progress in getting to know each other. “Thanks for everything.” Davey said quietly before rushing in to give me a hug when we were heading towards the bedroom. I returned the hug, and he blushed before heading into the guest bedroom. Part of me wanted to invite him to spend the night in my room again, but there was a look in his eyes that told me he liked the idea of staying in a room by himself. Mom and Dad returned sometime after midnight, and I woke up just enough to realize it was them coming home before rolling over and going back to sleep. I was up a little after seven in the morning, and I was slightly surprised to see Davey up as well. He’d told me how he liked to sleep in on weekends, and in that he wasn’t that different than the Davey I had known. “You going running this morning?” Davey asked me softly since my parents were still asleep. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt since it was slightly chilly, and he probably mistook that for meaning I was going running. There was a look in his eyes like he wanted the answer to be yes, so I changed my plan of fixing a bowl of cereal into a plan for going running. “Sure, you want to join me?” I asked him and he smiled. “I’m not sure if I want to, but I know I should.” He said with a low chuckle. “Last night proved that I need to exercise more.” “Cool, let me get you a sweatshirt.” I said as I turned to go back in my room. He was wearing the sweatpants from last night, so he was fine there, and I saw he had my old pair of running shoes on as well. “Dude, I’m borrowing so many of your clothes it’s like a good thing we’re so close in size.” He said and I chuckled. “Anytime you want to borrow something of mine, you just take it.” I told him and he blushed slightly as I threw him a green sweatshirt and he pulled it on over his head. “I don’t think I’ve ever known someone close enough to my sizes to share clothes like this.” Davey said. “It’s kind of weird.” “It’s kind of cool.” I responded. “I’ve never really known someone my size either. Brandon’s close to my height, but he’s skinny as a reed.” “Yeah, he is.” Davey agreed with a hint of sourness. We stretched without too much chatter, and this morning I let him set the pace. It started off slow, but he picked it up as we finished the three-mile run, and while he was breathing heavily, he was also smiling broadly. The adult part of me knew it was because he’d set a goal and completed it successfully. Davey liked achieving goals in his life, but he usually set them so high there was no way he could achieve them, and that failure would make him feel depressed. During the morning, my father drafted the two of us to help him clean up a lot of the clutter they’d cleared out of the guest bedroom, and to help him rearrange the stuff in the garage. After a bunch of talk, my weight equipment was moved to the back patio to make room for more of mom’s stuff in the garage. Being included in the task of helping move things relaxed Davey as he felt like he was helping to ‘work off’ what he felt he owed my father. After lunch I dropped him off at work before returning home. It was time for the third degree of questioning from both Dad and Mom as they wanted to know everything they could get out of me about Davey. They both liked him a lot, and the more I shared, the more they grew to look worried about him, and at the same time a bit hopeful. “I wish we could adopt him.” Mom said softly before looking at me. “You wouldn’t mind that, would you Brian?” “He’s got his own family, even if they’re all messed up right now.” Dad reminded her. “It’s more like he just needs a safe place to be himself. We can do that, certainly. Plus, I’ll drop by the apartment in S.F. when his mom’s having surgery. I’ll be able to chat with his grandmother then and get more perspective on everything. From what you said, Brian, she at least understands some of how this might be hard on David and want to help in any way she can. Plus, I’ll probably see Pete in the bank and we can talk about that fishing trip. I wasn’t sure what to think about him, but you seem certain he’s got David’s best interests at heart.” “He’s reacting the only way he really knows how, trying to keep Davey out of trouble.” I hadn’t flat out told them about Davey’s admission of drug use, but they’d taken the hints. Drugs was something guaranteed to get them upset, but at the same time, they were also smart enough to know that if Davey was willing to tell me about it, he was willing to at least listen to someone talking to him about stopping it. “What’s the real story with his car?” I asked dad, who frowned at me. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, dad, I know it won’t take a few days for the starter to come in.” I said and he smiled with a shake of his head. “I should have known you’d have figured that out.” He replied. “I’m having that front fender fixed from where it was all bent up. Do you know how that happened?” “Yeah, he was following someone too closely and reacted too late when they stopped in front of him.” I answered. “It was late and he’d been working a couple of shifts at a couple of restaurants.” “He works too hard for minimum wage.” Dad said. “I know he actually makes about a dollar above minimum wage.” I said with a shrug. “That’s still too little for working so much.” Mom frowned as she spoke her mind. “Can’t he get a better job?” “It was the first job he got offered.” I said with a shrug, having put together a couple of pieces of that story from our conversation last night. “I think he’s really scared of rejection, and he took the first thing that came along so he wouldn’t have to face rejection from somewhere else, and that’s why he’s not really interested in looking for other work.” “Does he have any other skills?” Mom asked with concern. “Do you know if he can type or anything like that?” “Yeah, he can type.” I answered. “He told me he took typing classes in Nevada and at Ceres High and passed the proficiency test with a typing speed of forty-five words per minute. They also taught filing and stuff like that.” “Then why doesn’t he try to get a job in an office?” Mom asked. “Probably because most of those types of jobs are during the day, not evenings and weekends like fast food.” Dad answered. “He might make more per hour doing that work, but he won’t have as many hours and that means he’ll make less overall.” “I hadn’t thought about that.” Mom stated. “I just want to thank you both for being so nice to him.” I said quietly and Dad shook his head while Mom smiled. “We’ve been lucky with you, overall, Brian.” Dad said. “Actually, we’ve been lucky all our lives, and I don’t think I could live with myself if we didn’t help someone like David when the situation presented itself to us.” “I guess we’re just old-fashioned liberals at heart.” Mom said with a fond smile for Dad, and I tried not to imagine where the smile might lead. After Davey got off work, he and I went out to dinner at a Lyon’s restaurant before I took him back to his grandmother’s. He was happier than I’d seen him in a while, and spent most of dinner telling me about some crazy customers that had come through his restaurant that day. It was an enjoyable evening, and I was sorry he was going back home, but I could also see the worried look in his eyes when he mentioned his mother. Monta insisted that I come in when she saw us pull up. She was outside with her great-granddaughter, Whitney, who was now just over a year old. Shantill was apparently out on a date, but Jenny was there, as was Davey’s mother. Jenny was far different than the girl I’d known in the last timeline. She was a little plumper, and lacked the drive and determination that had led her to being a fighter pilot and eventually the commanding general of an entire Air Force base. She’d retired after being the first female general to sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and very nearly being the first female Chair of that important military agency. That didn’t mean she wasn’t lively and interesting, just that it was in a far different way. She was more interested in gossip and what I’d call ‘girlie’ things than in flying or military life, and she definitely expressed an interest in me that made me uncomfortable on several levels. Davey just rolled his eyes at her a couple of times while we all chatted for about an hour. When I got home, I was surprised to see Trevor’s truck outside, and him waiting inside for me. “Trevor stopped by about an hour ago to see you.” Mom said by way of introduction as I came in and I looked at my friend with a little trepidation. Why was he here? “How about we go out back?” Trevor asked and I nodded in agreement before leading the way out into the back yard. He stood there, hands in his pockets and looked around for a bit before speaking. “You moved your weights out here.” “Yes, now what do you want?” I said sharply, more sharply than I intended and he winced slightly. “Dude, can’t I just come by and say hi to my friend?” Trevor asked defensively. “We’ve been friends forever, dude, and you gotta know I miss you.” “Yeah, well I figured you decided your girlfriend’s more important.” I said with a shrug. “Dude, don’t go there.” He said angrily. “What about your little boyfriend?” “He’s just my friend.” I said quickly. “According to Marcie she saw you guys together Friday night.” Trevor said with a leer and I felt my temper rise. “Yeah that was just before she started giving Mark Spencer a blow job in his car.” I sneered and he looked at me with wide eyes. “So that’s why he did it.” Trevor whispered. “Did what?” I asked, knowing what he probably meant. “He’s the one who slashed Jones’s tires for her.” Trevor said. “That’s why I came by here, to tell you that.” “Why?” I asked. “She was pissed when she saw you hanging out around him.” Trevor said softly. “Marcie thinks that if she can keep anyone from hanging out around you that you’ll beg her to take you back and so she’s sending a message to anyone who’d be your friend.” “Thanks, but that’s not what I meant.” I replied. “I already figured that part out, what I meant was why are you here telling me all this?” “We’ve been friends for years, Brian.” Trevor said softly, not meeting my eyes but looking out over the back yard. “I’m starting to think no girl’s worth destroying our friendship over.” “It’d have been nice for you to figure that out earlier.” I said angrily and instantly regretted those words. “I’m sorry, Trevor, that wasn’t fair. I’ve been as bad a friend over the past year from what it sounds like. You know, we use to have a better idea about what was important in life.” “Yeah, we did until we started really dating.” Trevor said with a sigh. “Is that what the future holds? We meet some girl, marry her and lose all of our old friends?” “It doesn’t have to be that way.” I said from the experience of actually having lived a life where I kept in touch with my old friends. We’d all been there, together, that day that the plane had slammed into the Pentagon despite Davey’s efforts, and we’d all been in the same room together when the last American troops left Iraq in 2007, and when war had broken out in 2009 following the assassination of the Iraqi Prime Minister, we’d all watched as Congress voted to send our troops back over there, and we’d all joined Trevor in celebrating his Super Bowl victory in 2011. “I don’t want it that way.” Trevor said after a long moment of quiet thinking. He turned back to look me in the eyes before holding out his hand. “Friends again?” “Always.” I said, taking his hand and shaking it firmly. “So how’s David doing with his car?” Trevor asked in a much easier tone and I relaxed as I told him how my father was fixing the car up. He shook his head, and we talked in earnest for several hours out there on the porch. It was a good beginning. Chapter 9 Monday morning I picked Davey up early, before anyone else in his grandmother’s house was even awake, and we ran around the track at the school. By the time we were done, the gym was opened and Coach Cole nodded at us as we came in for a shower. Davey was exhausted, but once again completing the run had left him in a good mood. We hit the cafeteria for breakfast, and I noticed him choosing much the same food that I did, staying away from the high cholesterol, greasy stuff that he might have normally eaten. Since he didn’t have to work that afternoon, he stayed around school while I went to baseball practice. I could see him sitting there on the bleachers, sneaking looks at the guys on the team in their practice gear, and smiled to myself since I was the recipient of most of those looks. Mark Spencer was spending most of the practice ignoring me until sliding practice where he tried to swipe my leg with his cleats. Coach Anders spotted his attempt and sent him running laps for the rest of practice with a threat that if he did it again, he’d be suspended from the team for a week. “Yo, Breckenridge, I hear that Jones guy over there is bobbing your knob now.” Adam Mitchell, another junior on the team who also played football said to me in a low voice as we stood near the dugout while the sliding drills continued. “If he was, it’d be better than that bitch Marcie.” I said forcefully and Mitchell burst out in laughter, nearly doubling over. “Yo, Jones, why don’t you do something useful instead of sitting there?” Coach Anders called out to Davey a few minutes later and Davey looked up with curiosity. “Get over here.” Davey complied, getting up and putting away the book he’d been reading. Anders gave him the clipboard he’d been making notes on and then had Davey following him around, scribing notes on the clipboard about the performance of different members of the team. That left a smile on my face, and I wondered again at how the staff at a school with over two thousand students still found time to do little things like Anders was doing. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, Spencer?” Anders’s voice boomed out near the end of practice and I looked up from where I’d just slid into second base before the tag to see Spencer caught red-handed rifling through Davey’s backpack. Davey had left it on the bleachers where he’d been sitting, and Spencer was halfway through tearing some pages out of the book Davey had been reading. Davey stood next to the coach with a look of anger on his face. “I…uh…” Spencer stammered but the Coach cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Get your stupid ass into my office and wait for me there.” Anders growled. “Everyone, twenty laps and practice is over. Jones, make sure they all complete their laps and then help Riley get the equipment put up before meeting me in my office. I want to talk to you too.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said weakly, glaring at Spencer. “Oh, and make sure nothing’s missing from your backpack and give me the details of anything Spencer damaged.” Anders ordered before walking away, following the path a sullen Mark Spencer was taking to the gym and the coach’s office. I gave Davey a sympathetic look that he shrugged off before joining the team to make the laps. “That was plain wrong.” Adam Mitchell said as he jogged near me. Trevor was further back in the bunch, and Brandon was lagging behind all of us when several people made a point of speeding up to keep from being beside him. It seemed the team knew damn well where the battle lines were being drawn between Marcie and I, and while people didn’t exactly flock around me, they knew Brandon was on ‘her’ side right now and were shunning him. The few times I glimpsed his face, it looked like he was deep in thought. “Which part?” I asked Adam after staying quiet for a moment. His statement could have gone both ways. “Spencer going through his backpack.” Adam said softly. “I heard your ex-girlfriend bragging at lunch about how Spencer slashed that Jones guy’s tires over the weekend and now this. She’s fucking wacko. Dude, you know I was just teasing you about the fag shit, right? I mean, no one really believes the shit she’s talking about. Most people know she’s pissed you dumped her ass for being a slut and she’s just trying to get back at you.” “Don’t worry about it, dude.” I said with a shrug. “So, Jones, he’s a pretty cool guy?” Adam asked a lap later. Trevor and a few other teammates were now running with us. “We knew him in junior high at La Loma.” Trevor answered before I could say anything. “He’s a bit geeky but not bad. He played on the freshman team before he moved to Nevada.” “I heard his dad’s a pervert.” Rich, another of our teammates said derisively. “It was in the papers how his old man was porkin’ Jones’s sister.” “Don’t even fucking joke about that shit.” Tim, another of our teammates said with a disgusted sound in his voice. “Imagine if that was your sister.” “I don’t have a sister.” Rich said defensively. “You do have a brother, don’t you?” Tim shot back. “Don’t fucking even suggest that shit.” Rich’s voice filled with anger. “Now imagine what it must be like for Jones.” I said softly, gathering everyone’s attention, and after another lap that passed by in silence, Rich spoke up again. “How does he stand it?” Rich asked quietly. “Do you think Jones will help Riley and Coach out for the season?” Tim asked me in the silence that followed Rich’s comment. “Probably not.” I said with a shake of my head. “He works a lot you know. I’m giving him a ride for now until his car’s fixed and he was only here today because he had the day off. His mom and sister need the money bad. His mom, she’s getting ready for a major surgery in a week or two, and his sister’s going to therapy that he has to pay for since no one else can.” “Dude, he pays for all that shit?” Rich asked with surprise. “Why don’t someone else pay, like his father or the state?” “Who’d hire his father after he was in the news so much?” I snorted. “His mother can’t work, at least until after the surgery because of her back and the state’s dicking her around on disability. Someone has to pay for that stuff, and so he works his ass off.” “Dude, that’s so unfair.” Tim said quietly. “Fuck, how’s he paying to fix his car with all those bills?” “Dad’s paying for it.” I said with a shrug. “He’s lucky to have you for a friend.” Trevor said with a hint of bitterness in his voice. I guessed the bitterness was for his having taken Marcie’s side of everything at first. “More like I’m lucky to have him for a friend.” I replied. “Why’s that?” Rich asked quietly. “He likes to play sports.” I said quietly. “At his last school he played football, basketball, track, just about every sport they offered, and he was on the debate team and a whole bunch of other stuff. The guy’s smart, and he’s had to give all that up so he can earn enough money to pay his sister’s psychologist’s bills. How many of us would give up everything we wanted to help our family out? That’s loyalty, and he gives the same loyalty to friends, too.” “Oh.” Rich said, and we finished the rest of our laps in relative silence. Davey was already inside the gym as I entered with the rest of the team. There was no sign of Mark Spencer, but Davey was in with Coach Anders while I got undressed and showered. By the time I was clean and dressed in my street clothes, there was another commotion and we all turned to see Coach Cole leading a red-faced Mark Spencer into the gym. He had Spencer’s right arm bent behind his back and had the angriest look on his face I’d ever seen before. “Breckenridge, get in the office now!” Cole roared and I jumped to obey, stuffing my dirty practice uniform into my bag before leaving the bag on the bench and double-timing to the office. “What’s he done now?” Coach Anders asked as I entered the office and shut the door behind me. The rest of the team was trying to hear what was going on without looking like it, but Cole crossed the room to close the blinds. He’d dumped Mark into one of the chairs where Mark was glowering at Davey and I in turn. Davey’s shoulders were hunched up, and he was looking at the floor. “I found him taking a key to Breckenridge’s car.” Cole growled angrily before looking at me. “Sorry, Breckenridge, you’ve got a couple of good scratches that are going to require the car to be repainted probably.” “You son of a bitch.” I growled, turning angrily to Spencer. “Watch your language, Breckenridge.” Coach Anders growled at me. “That’s five laps you owe me tomorrow before practice.” “Yes, coach.” I said, turning my anger down to a hard simmer. “Spencer, what part of me sending you to the Principal as punishment for what you’d already done didn’t you understand?” Coach Anders asked of Spencer who just shrugged his shoulders while staring at his hand. “Do you understand what has to happen now?” “Borsch already suspended me for two days and I have to pay that faggot back for the stupid book.” Spencer said sullenly. “You can count on another trip to Principal’s office for that.” Anders growled. “What, you give Breckenridge a couple of laps and send me to the Principal?” Spencer sneered. “That’s really fair.” “Breckenridge is on the team, you’re not.” Anders said sternly. “What?” Spencer’s voice almost cracked in his surprise. “Since when?” “Since Coach Cole found you keying Breckenridge’s car.” Anders retorted. “I won’t have a vandal on my team.” “That’s fucking great.” Spencer murmured, glaring daggers at Davey and then at me. “You’ll pay for this, both of you.” “Actually, it’s you who’ll pay.” Cole said angrily. “We’ll be calling the police here in a few minutes for them to come and take our statements and photograph the evidence of what you did. Breckenridge here is going to press charges, so there’ll be criminal charges, and you’ll have to pay for the damage you caused.” “Like fucking hell I will.” Spencer growled. “I’ll pay for slashing the fag’s tires before I’ll pay for Breckenridge’s car.” “What?” Anders growled with wide eyes as he sat up a bit straighter. Spencer realized he’d said too much, and kept his mouth shut. “What’s he talking about, Jones?” “The tires were slashed on my car over the weekend, Coach.” Davey explained in a voice that was tightly controlled. He was glaring at Spencer and flexing his hands like he wanted to hit the guy. “We were pretty sure it was him who did it, and a couple of people have told me they heard Marcie bragging about him doing it, but you know, that’s all hearsay. Now he’s admitted it front of me. Can you please call the cops? I want to file charges for that too.” “We all heard him, Jones.” Cole said sternly. “Brian, you think the shop that’s working on the car threw the tires out?” Davey asked. “We’ll find out.” I assured him and he nodded, and this time it was he who glared daggers at Spencer, who was now looking fairly pale. Most of the team had left by the time that the police finished, and while they weren’t sure if they could get charges to stick over Davey’s tires, they were quite certain they could get a conviction for the keying of my car, even though it was only a misdemeanor vandalism charge, and he’d likely get only a few hours of community service. The important part was that his father was called in by the police, as was my father. No one could reach Davey’s mother, who was in the Bay Area having tests done, but his grandfather showed up, ready to spit nails. The look of shock on Davey’s face as his grandfather took up Davey’s side and threatened Mr. Spencer with lawsuits and the ‘almighty judgment of the Lord God on your worthless son’ was a sight to see, and I think for the first time in a long time, Davey realized his grandfather really did care for him. “Davey, I’ll give you a ride home.” Pete said as we stood outside looking at my car. “Brian, I’m sorry this had to happen to your handsome car.” “I’m just glad we know who did it and he’ll be paying the price for what he did to not only my car but Davey’s car as well.” I said and Pete nodded. “Davey, this one here’s a good guy.” Pete said with a jerk of his thumb towards me. “You keep him close and we’ll see about changing some things around the house.” “Thanks, Mr. Barrow.” I said quietly and he snorted. “Call me Pete, son.” He said as he held out his hand and I shook it firmly. “Now, let’s get a move on, Davey. Mr. Breckenridge, you’ve got a fine son there, and I appreciate all the help you’ve given my grandson. As soon as his car’s fixed, you bring me the bill.” “Thank you.” Dad said with a nod, although the look in his eyes said Pete would be a long time waiting for that bill. “Brian, you want to get your car to a shop and see about an estimate?” “Let’s wait for Davey’s car to get fixed.” I suggested and Dad nodded. “I’ve got to get back to work.” Dad said. “I’ll see you at dinner?” “Yep.” I said and smiled at him as thanks for his support and help. Finding Trevor waiting for me on the front porch of the house wasn’t a surprise, but Brandon being there with him was a surprise. Mom wasn’t home yet, so they’d waited on the porch for me. When they saw me approach, they both stood up, although Brandon had his hands in his pants pockets and didn’t really meet my gaze. “Hey guys.” I said as lightly as I could and Trevor smiled half-heartedly while Brandon scuffed a foot on the sidewalk. I unlocked the door and they followed me into the house were we stood in the living room. “You want something to drink?” “I’m sorry.” Brandon said softly as an answer, and he lifted his head up to meet my eyes, ready to flinch but he didn’t see any anger there. He took a deep breath as he met my gaze and continued. “I haven’t been a good friend. Marcie’s crazy, and she got our girlfriends to give us ultimatums. I should have known better than to cave to her.” “I forgive you.” I said immediately and held out my hand. He sighed with relief and took it quickly. “So does this mean we’re all three single again?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with a grin. “I got a call as soon as I got home demanding to know what I was going to do to help Marcie and Mark get back at you and Davey and I told her it was over.” “I did too.” Brandon said softly. “Dude, there’s something you need to know, too.” “What’s that?” I asked as a little knot of worry filled my gut. “Marcie, she had me follow you and Davey the other day.” Brandon said with a guilty look on his face. “She knows he doesn’t live in the district and she’s thinking of going to Principal Borsch and getting Davey in trouble. That’s what they wanted me to do, go with them and tell him I’ve seen where Davey really lives. She thinks that’ll get him kicked out of school. She had Mark check earlier today. He’s got a friend who works in the attendance office and he got in Davey’s record and figured out that the address on Davey’s record isn’t where he lives.” “You’re serious.” I said with a frown. Marcie had ammunition now, and if she used it, there wasn’t much we could do about that, not without some help at least. “Yeah, I’m sorry I helped her out.” Brandon said. “Tell that to Davey.” I snapped and he winced. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have snapped like that.” “I deserve it.” Brandon said. “What happened with Spencer? I saw what he did to your car, and so did most of the team. A couple of the guys were wanting to hunt him down and beat the shit out of him.” “He’s being taken care of.” I said with a smile, and related the afternoon’s events to them, or at least what they didn’t already know. “Whew, he’s going to be in a world of shit.” Trevor said with a chuckle. “His father ain’t exactly the most understanding of guys.” “You can say that again.” Brandon laughed. “So, tell us the truth, you and Davey?” “We’re good friends, almost as good friends as I was with the two of you.” I said pointedly and they both nodded slowly. “You mean as good friends as we are again.” Trevor countered. “We’ll see.” I replied and they both nodded with acceptance of that. “So, you two are going to look for new girlfriends?” I asked and Brandon shook his head. “You know, I think I’ll stay single for a bit.” Brandon said with a shrug. “I will too, besides there’s always the barn.” Trevor said with a wink towards Brandon who blushed a bit before smiling. I turned away, not really ready to deal with this yet from my friends. How could they flip-flop so easily between denying they ever did anything with guys and then be this open? “Brian, you want to join us?” “Um, no thanks.” I said with a blush and they laughed. “Well, we’ll like see you tomorrow at school, right?” Brandon asked, and I realized they were really going to be going to Trevor’s barn right now! Jesus they were… teenagers. “Yeah, see you guys at school.” I assured them and then I winked. “Don’t have too much fun in that barn.” “We will.” Trevor said before leading the way out. The phone rang before the door had even finished shutting behind them and I went to answer it before the machine picked up the call. The fact that it was a crank call with heavy breathing and threats on the other end didn’t surprise me. The way they hung up when I mentioned that the police were monitoring all calls to the house in light of recent events ended the call rather quickly. There was homework to do, and a list of chores from my mother that kept me busy for most of the afternoon. I even put my practice uniform in the wash and it was almost dry by the time she got home. Apparently she’d already heard about my day from Dad, and wanted to hear more details, which I gave to her as she started dinner. Davey’s upcoming problem with his residence was in the back of my mind, and the obvious solution was something I wanted to approach carefully, so I didn’t tell her about that yet. Over dinner, Dad had more to say about the day’s events, and he informed me that he’d hired an attorney to represent me and Davey both in a civil suit against Spencer’s and Marcie’s parents. He never really expected to see any money out of them, but he wanted the suit on record, because it would be a permanent record against not only their parents but against Marcie and Spencer. “Dad, there’s another problem you should know about as well.” I said calmly after dinner was over and Dad had finished his dialogue about how Marcie and Spencer were being dealt with. “What is it?” Dad asked just as calmly. “Brandon and Trevor came over after I got back today.” I said and Mom smiled. “You guys have made up?” She asked. “Yes.” I answered and she smiled broadly. “I told you it was just a matter of time.” She reminded me. “You were right, but Brandon had some disturbing news.” I continued. “Dad, you see, we know Davey doesn’t live in the district for Downey, but he also didn’t receive a legitimate transfer. A friend of his mother’s who does live in the district has been letting them use her address on Davey’s record.” “Marcie somehow figured this out?” Dad asked. “Yeah, she had Brandon follow us over the weekend.” I said. “So she’s reported it to the District?” Mom asked and I nodded. “If they investigate they’ll figure it out and send Davey back to Ceres.” Dad said shortly. “You know, that is where he should be going to school if he lives there.” “He’s miserable there, dad.” I responded. “He was fairly miserable at Downey too.” Dad replied. “Was being the key word there.” I pointed out and he nodded. “What do you expect me to do about this?” Dad asked me point-blank. “Expect?” I said. “I don’t expect anything, but I was hoping we might be able to help Davey come up with some alternatives to having to switch schools just when things are starting to look up for him here.” “You mean besides the crap Marcie’s pulling?” Mom said scornfully. “I hate to say it, but I don’t know what you ever saw in that girl.” Dad snorted. “I don’t either.” I replied in complete honesty. “Well I think the first thing we should do is call Pete and Davey and maybe get together with them to discuss this.” Dad said. “I agree.” Mom said and I nodded. He got up to leave the room and as soon as he was gone, Mom turned to me. “Brian, have you thought about dating again?” “Nope.” I snorted. “After Marcie, it’s far too early to think about stuff like that.” “Good.” Mom said with a nod of her head that surprised me. “Brian, Pete’s asked us to come by their place.” Dad said as he came back into the room. He was frowning and I got worried. “Davey’s mom was hospitalized by the doctors in San Francisco today. They just found out a little bit ago.” “Oh no.” Mom murmured, and she got up to go get her jacket. “I’m coming as well.” “I’ll get my jacket.” I said as it had gotten chilly outside as soon as the sun had set. The weather reports also called for a light rain tonight. The house was in near-pandemonium when we arrived. Two of Davey’s aunts, Fran and Priscilla were there, as was Davey and his sister, Jenny. Both of them looked really worried, and had food left over on their plates while almost everyone else had finished their food. His cousin Shantill was there, while her mother Fran held Shantill’s daughter in her arms, trying to calm the crying baby. Pete was sitting at the head of the table with a scowl on his face, and he nodded to my father as we entered, and smiled at my mother when Dad introduced her. “Let’s go in the living room.” He said, leading us through the doorway that connected the dining room with the living room. It was paneled in a dark wood, and had an old stereo console that ran the full length of one of the walls. We all sat down in the room, with Pete in one armchair, Davey in another while I sat on the couch with my parents. Pete shut the folding door across the kitchen for more privacy while Fran and Priscilla kept everyone else occupied. When we were all seated, and Priscilla had brought in some glasses of water for us, he spoke again. “I appreciate you folks coming down here like this. Davey’s made some good friends in you and I hate to impose on you any more.” “We’re honored to have Davey as a friend of our son’s.” Dad said. “He’s a fine young man.” “He can be when he puts his mind to the job.” Pete said with a sideways look at Davey who was looking withdrawn. “Monta’s in a fit right now what with Sandy being hospitalized so sudden like.” “Do we know what’s wrong yet?” Dad asked. “All they said was complications from her back.” Pete said sourly. “That girl’s had to deal with too much in her life as it is without this. There’s nothing we can do about that now but pray. Monta said you had a place you were willing to rent to her?” “She insisted on paying rent.” Dad said firmly. “As far as we’re concerned, she’s free to use it anytime without charge.” “We’ll pay for what we use.” Pete said just as firmly. “We do appreciate the use of the place, though. I’m heading up there in a bit to help Monta out. That woman will spend so much time in a tizzy over Sandy that she won’t take care of herself and both of them will end up in the hospital.” “I’ve brought the keys and directions on how to get there from Children’s Hospital.” Dad said, pulling a folded piece of paper and a set of keys from his pocket. He gave them to me and I got up and handed them to Pete. “It’s much appreciated.” Pete said and then he looked over at Davey for a long moment. “Thanks for all the help you’ve been giving me and my family.” Davey said in a way that suggested he’d been told exactly what to say. Despite that, his eyes showed that the sentiment was real. “We’re glad to be of help.” Mom said immediately. “It’s the right thing to do, and I knew if we needed help like this, you and your family wouldn’t hesitate to return the favor.” “I don’t want to have to ask this, but I do have another favor to ask.” Pete said at that point. “Fran and Priscilla will take turns watching out for Shantill and Whitney, and the mother of one of Jenny’s friends has offered to take her in for a week or two until I get back in town. Monta won’t leave that city until Sandy comes home, but there’s no need for me to stay the full time up there. That leaves Davey, and honestly I’d rather he stay with someone else than stay here on his own. Fran could take him in, but she’s going to have enough on her plate without adding Davey to it, and I don’t like that oldest boy of hers. He’ll just draw Davey into more trouble.” “Papa.” Davey started to protest, but quieted at the look on his grandfather’s face. Mom and Dad looked at each other and then at me for a moment before they nodded at each other. “Pete, we’d appreciate it if you’d let Davey stay with us until things settle down here at home.” Dad said. “He and Brian get along well, and he’s proved to be helpful around the house. We’d be honored if you thought it was good for him to stay with us.” “I can help out with his room and board.” Pete said gruffly. “We had a talk tonight and he’s going to quit his job tomorrow. There’s just too damn much stuff going on with this family for him to waste his time working away. He’s already proved he would if he had too, and that’s good enough for me. I’ve told him tonight that as long as he’s getting good grades in school, and doing extra-curricular work, I will pay his car payments, insurance, and cover Jenny’s bills. The coach of the baseball team offered to pay him twenty bucks a week if he worked as an equipment manager for the team, so he’ll have some spending money at least.” “We won’t take a dime, Pete.” Dad said firmly. “He’ll do chores around the house just like Brian and that’ll cover his room and board.” “You sure about that?” Pete asked. “You’ll give him real chores to do?” “Yes.” Dad said firmly, and my stomach did a little flip-flop. Davey was going to be staying at my house full-time now. It made me excited, but at the same time nervous. “Then I’ll not push that.” Pete said sternly. “Mind you, it’s just for a few weeks until we get things settled with Sandy.” “It won’t be a problem even if it goes a bit longer.” Dad said confidently and Mom nodded her agreement. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” Pete said stolidly. “Davey, why don’t you and Brian go pack your stuff for a week, and remember what I told you.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said as he stood up. I stood as well, and followed him into the house entryway and through the kitchen where he was all but tackled by his blond sister. “I can’t believe this is happening.” Jenny cried into his shoulder while their aunts looked on. Shantill was on the phone again, laughing at whatever she was hearing from the person on the other side of the line. It seemed almost cruel for her to be laughing while her cousins were going through a bad time. “It’ll be okay, sis.” Davey said softly, rubbing a hand through her long, blond hair. “I don’t want you to go.” She whined and I felt sorry for her, and felt a bit selfish that I was so happy Davey would be staying with us. “It’s only for a week or two, and my car will be fixed by the weekend, so we can go see her then.” Davey said. “You promise?” She asked hopefully. “What about your work?” “Papa says I don’t have to work anymore.” Davey said with a hint of disbelief in his voice. That brought a smile to my face, because it was something the Pete Barrow I remembered would have done for his grandson. “Really?” Jenny asked. “What about my appointments?” “He’ll take care of them.” Davey said with even more disbelief showing in his voice. “You’ve got Brian’s number, right?” “Yes.” She said. “You’ve got the number to Stacey’s house, right?” “Yep.” Davey agreed with a smile. “I’ll call you every night, okay?” “Okay.” She said and wiped her nose with the back of her hand like I’d seen Davey do over the weekend. It was a cute family trait, one I’d noticed several times before in the other timeline. “Good, now I’ve got to go pack and you should too.” He told her gently. “Stacey’s mom will be here soon.” “Yeah.” She said with a smile and went down the hallway to the bedroom she shared with her mother. I followed Davey down into the family room where he pulled out a suitcase, a duffel bag, and his school backpack before putting clothes in them. “I really appreciate this.” He said to me as I stood and watched him. Part of me wanted to help, but I sensed this was something he wanted to do himself. “You know it’s not a problem.” I told him and he nodded his head while he finished loading his suitcase and bags. When he’d finished, he looked wistfully at his stereo. “You going to bring your stereo?” “You don’t think it’d be a problem?” He asked. “I mean it’s only for a week or two.” “Dude, if you want to bring it, bring it.” I encouraged him and he smiled before moving to disconnect all the wires. It took only one trip for the both of us to load up the trunk of Mom’s car with his stuff, and when we shut the trunk, we turned to find my parents standing there with his grandfather on the sidewalk. “Thank you for everything, Papa.” Davey said and the old man nodded gruffly before pulling Davey into a very quick hug. That was a loud statement of affection from the man who usually only gave handshakes unless it was to a pretty girl. “You just do what we talked about.” Pete said sternly and Davey nodded his agreement. “Let’s get going so we can get you settled in, Davey.” Dad said kindly and turned to shake Pete’s hand before we got into the car. I could see Pete’s smile when Mom hugged him before joining us in the car. It was a slight surprise, but a welcome one when Davey’s hand reached across the back seat to find mine in a tight grip as Dad drove us home. Chapter 10 Hearing a description of something and seeing it unfold in front of you are two totally different things, and no matter how good the description is, sometimes it can’t just relate the full majesty, or horror of an event. I had stood on a slight hill and watched an airliner slam into the Pentagon in a different timeline, but the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger brought tears to my eyes much the same as the events of 9/11 had in that other time. Like most of the other kids in our school, I watched the televisions that had been placed around the school to show the destruction of NASA’s premier vehicle, and the death of seven astronauts. “My god.” Davey whispered in horror from next to me as we watched the event happen in slow motion while a news channel played it over and over again. There was the sound of a few girls weeping in the library, but most of the kids watched it over and over again in stunned silence as commentators explored those final moments over and over again, and threw out theories on what could have gone wrong. “It was the o-rings on the booster, you stupid idiot.” I murmured to the commentator, remembering another of Davey’s explanations, and realized I should have kept my mouth shut when this Davey looked at me with surprise. “What makes you say that?” He asked me. “Just a hunch.” I temporized. “David Jones, please report to the Principal’s office.” A voice said over the loudspeaker, causing a few students to jerk in surprise, and several turned to Davey who looked confused. “I wonder what I’ve done now.” Davey said softly before walking off, leaving me there to chew on my lip nervously. Could Marcie’s little ploy about where he lived have already born fruit or was this fallout from yesterday? Either way, I knew dad needed to know and I found the nearest pay phone to call him at work. “Go to the Principal’s office and wait for me there.” Dad ordered me as soon as I’d told him. “If it’s about yesterday they’ll probably call you, if it’s about his residence, well I think I’ve got what we need to fix that problem.” “Okay.” I said with as much enthusiasm as I could muster and went to the office. The student on duty there, a friend of Marcie’s, gave me a glare but said nothing as I sat down. “Can I help you son?” The older secretary said after she realized the girl wasn’t going to address me. “I’m just waiting for Davey to get done in there.” I said with a nod towards the Principal’s office. “Oh, dear, he’s going to be a while.” She said with a shake of her head. “We need to get his parents in here and we can’t seem to get a hold of his mother at all.” “That’s probably because she’s been hospitalized in San Francisco.” I said quickly and she gave me a questioning look. “You’re a friend of his?” She asked, and I looked at Marcie’s friend with a significant glance and she got my drift. “Why don’t you come back here and tell me how I can get in touch with his parents.” I nodded and got another glare from the girl before sitting down at the woman’s desk. If we talked in low tones, the girl wouldn’t hear what we said. The older secretary smiled at me as I sat. “Now, you say his mother is in the hospital?” “Yes, Children’s Hospital in San Francisco.” I said. “His grandparents are up there too. She was hospitalized yesterday.” “What about his father?” She asked with a frown and then her frown deepened as her eyes widened. “Now that was a stupid question, of course he’s not someone we can call about this. Where is David staying? Certainly they didn’t leave him alone to fend for himself.” “No, he’s staying at my house.” I told her. “I’ve already called my father and he’s on his way in here.” “Oh, that’s a good thing dear.” She said with a genuine smile. “Tell me, how long has he been…” “Brian!” Dad’s voice called out, interrupting her and I looked over to see my father dressed in his business suit and staring down the girl who looked like she’d tried to misdirect him or something. “Ah, you must be Mr. Breckenridge.” The secretary said as she stood up. As much as I couldn’t really remember her name, she apparently knew me just fine. She walked over to the counter and smiled at my dad. “Your son was just helping me figure out how to get in touch with a responsible adult for Mr. Jones.” “Yes, well that would be me.” Dad said with authority filling his voice. He handed over a piece of paper that I could see had been notarized. “This is of course a fax copy, but you’ll see that Sandy Jones, mother of one David Jones, Jr., has granted temporary guardianship of David Jones Jr. to my wife and me. As he’ll be staying with us for an indefinite period of time depending on the outcome of her surgery, I had planned to file this with the school. Now, I’d like to know why my ward has been called into the office of the Principal.” “This appears to be in order, although a certified copy should be filed as soon as you have one.” The secretary said as she looked over the document. “How long do you think this arrangement will last? When is Mrs. Jones expected to be back home?” “It’ll be at least a month, if not longer.” Dad said quickly. “My wife and I have told her to worry about getting her strength back fully before worrying about David. As far as we’re concerned, he’ll be living at our home at least through the end of the semester.” “I see.” She said with a wide smile that told both my father and I that she was quite aware of what he was doing. “I take it you do know why Mr. Jones was called into the office and why we’re trying to get in touch with his family?” “I’m not sure I understand what you mean.” Father said ingenuously and she smiled even more. “Well, why don’t you follow me and I’ll introduce you to the Principal.” She said. “I’ve met him before.” Dad said. “Yes, that’s right.” She smiled. “Brian, why don’t you have a seat? Davey should be out shortly.” I went and sat down, and within a couple of minutes Davey shuffled out of the office while my father stayed behind, talking to Principal Borsch. Davey’s shoulders were slumped and he barely looked up as he slouched in his seat next to me. The bitch behind the counter smirked at him until she saw my glare. “How did they find out?” Davey murmured softly. “They’re going to ship me back to Ceres unless Mr. B can do something.” “I wouldn’t worry too much about that.” I said confidently “As for how they found out, I give you one guess.” “You know, sometimes I wonder if being your friend is a curse or blessing.” Davey muttered, but the corners of his lips quirked and I knew he was joking, or at least mostly joking. “She’ll pay for this.” I said firmly and he started to laugh softly. “She already has.” Davey said insightfully. “She’s doing this to try and win you back, but all she’s doing is guaranteeing you’ll never give her the time of day again. As long as I can still go to school here, that’s fine with me.” “We’ll make sure that happens.” I said, and since we’d really had no chance to talk about last night, I decided to ask him another question. “What was up with your grandfather last night? Why’s he making you quit?” “I don’t think you heard him and Coach Cole talking yesterday.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Papa won’t say what Cole said to him, but when we got home he asked me some real tough questions. I can’t believe it, but I told him the truth, even when he asked me about drinking and drugs. That’s when he told me I had to quit my job. He told me I’d proven I’d work to support a family but that I should have time to be a kid instead of having to grow up just because my old man was a loser. That hurt, but I don’t think he meant to insult me that time. He asked me what I did in school back in Nevada instead of drinking and doing drugs, and when I told him about being in sports and other stuff, he told me that was what he wanted me to do. Coach Cole told him they wanted me to help with the baseball team, doing equipment manager stuff with Riley and helping the coaches. Then he wants me to try out for football in the fall.” “That’ll be good.” I said with a smile as a happy feeling washed over me. This was what Davey’s high school life was supposed to be like. “Yeah, and I have to go fishing and camping with him over the summer.” Davey said with a snort. “We never caught a fish when I was a kid and went with him.” “It’s not catching the fish that’s the point.” I told Davey. “It’s going and being in the company of the other person, even if you never say anything.” “You sound like you’ve gone fishing with him.” Davey snorted. “Maybe I have, in a weird kind of way.” I said and he gave me an odd look before shrugging. “Well, anyway, I don’t rightly like giving up work.” Davey said with a sigh. “Janice says I have a chance at making Assistant Manager when I turn eighteen next year and that’s good money.” “College gets you better money.” I said. “If you can afford it.” Davey snorted. “There are always scholarships.” I reminded him. “If you’re willing to take hand-outs.” He said derisively. “They’re not hand-outs, you have to earn them.” I pointed out and he gave me a weird look. “Look, you can’t get a scholarship with bad grades, or for any number of reasons. You have to earn them, it’s just usually academic or other work around school or the community that helps you earn them. They aren’t handouts.” “That’s what you think.” Davey said sourly, but he was at least thinking about what I said, I was sure, as Dad came out of the Principal’s office. He turned to shake the man’s hand one more time before walking around the counter and stopping in front of us. “David, Brian, why don’t you walk me to the car.” He said and we stood up to follow him out. Once we were out of the building he let out a sigh. “Davey, I don’t like lying. It almost always comes back and bites you in the ass, but I’ve skirted the line today for you. Pete got your mom to sign a Limited Guardianship for you. It names me as your temporary Guardian until your mother rescinds it after she’s recovered. What that means is that I’m legally obligated to care for you as if you were my son until she says otherwise.” “Thank you, Mr. B.” Davey said in a barely audible voice. His shoulders were slumped again and Dad looked sharply at him. “What that means, Davey, is what we talked about a little last night after we got back to the house.” Dad continued. “I expect you to obey the rules we set out for you, to tell us if something is wrong or you need help, to let us know where you are and not to make any long trips without getting our approval first, and that does include going to see your mother, but I also promise we will make sure you have time and gas to go see her as much as possible. The only real difference this document makes is that now it’s a legal relationship. Don’t think it means your mother isn’t still your mother. As soon as she’s better all she has to do is say she’s rescinding the guardianship and it’s gone. What it does mean, and what’s especially important given the fact that the school now knows you really did not live in the district, is that your legal residence is now our house, inside the Downey District, until and unless your mother rescinds the guardianship.” “You mean… you mean I won’t be forced to go to Ceres?” Davey said with a sigh of relief. “That’s what it means for now.” Dad said with a smile. “Now, more than likely it’ll last just fine for the rest of this semester, but next year you’ll either have to be still living with us or your mother will have to live in the district. “That’s fine, at least for now it’s not a threat.” Davey said happily, and he hugged my father quickly. “Thanks, Mr. B.” “I’m glad I thought of it in time.” Dad said before getting into his car. “I’ll see you boys at dinner.” “Bye, dad.” I said before he pulled off, and Davey was grinning at me. “So does this mean we’re temporary brothers?” Davey asked with a giggle and I felt a moment of horror. Did that mean he and I getting together would be incest? No, and if it did, who cares? “Just be careful, Davey.” I warned him and he frowned. “You know what they say about brothers and incest being best.” “Ewe, gross.” He said, mock-gagging with a finger down his throat. We both laughed as we went back into the school. Practice that afternoon was cancelled, although Davey spent a few minutes talking to the coaches about baseball practice. He worked out a deal with them that let him give two weeks notice at work, and when we stopped by the restaurant where he worked primarily, his manager Janice seemed downright happy that he was quitting instead of upset like he expected. They worked out a deal where he’d have time to work at practice before going to work there for three days this week and two days next week. He tried to offer to work more, but she flat out refused saying they had just hired four more people that week. We’d been home for only a few minutes before Trevor called to say a bunch of guys from the team were meeting up at a nearby field to throw a few balls. It took a little work, but I got Davey to go with me and we went to the field wearing sweats. It almost turned into a disaster. I’d not realized that Davey had almost never played catch in this timeline, when in the last he’d been amazing at baseball. For a worried moment after he dropped the ball for the tenth time, I worried the guys were going to start teasing him, but to my surprise Adam took him to the side while the rest of us continued to toss the ball back and forth. Up until dinner time, Adam worked with him until he was catching just about every other toss that Adam threw him, and doing a decent job tossing the ball back. It wasn’t anywhere good enough to make the team, but it was better than he’d been at the start, and he had a smile on his face as we went home for dinner. That night he talked to one of his aunts on the phone after dinner. The doctors had moved up his mother’s surgery to the end of the week. He’d be able to see her on Saturday, when she should be out of surgery and doing fine. His next call was to his sister, who he talked to for about an hour before making a third call to Todd. I’d barely talked to the red-head in the last week, we’d nodded to each other every time we passed in the hallways. By the time he was off the phone, it was almost bedtime, and he worked furiously at the rest of his homework before going into ‘his’ room and going to sleep. Things were finally starting to come together for both of us, and I slept peacefully that night. Mark Spencer came back to school on Friday, and spent every minute he could staring at us. It made Davey uncomfortable, but we tried to ignore him. Certainly Brandon and Trevor’s presence was helpful to me, although Davey was still a little uncertain around them. I was thinking he was uncomfortable with them on several levels, not just because he’d been intimate with them before, or because they’d at first sided with Marcie, but more a combination of those things. On Friday afternoon, we went to pick up his car. I drove us there, and Dad met us there, a smile on his face as he waited for Davey to see his car. Davey gasped at the first site of the car with its front end repaired, and the car sported a fresh paint job of a dark blue. “You…you shouldn’t have done all this.” Davey said with tears in his eyes while Dad handed him his keys back. “I’ll never be able to repay all this.” “Just don’t scratch the new paint job when you take your sister to see your mother tomorrow.” Dad said with a smile as he lifted the hood to show him the engine. A lot of work had been done there, too, I knew. Dad had spent fifteen hundred dollars on the car, almost as much as Davey’s grandfather had paid to finish the payments due on the car. “Thank you.” Davey said, giving my father another hug. Dad smiled and returned it while Davey turned to me. “C’mon, Brian, let’s go for a drive.” “Don’t forget, you’ll need to give Brian a ride next week while they work on his car.” Dad told Davey who nodded enthusiastically while getting into his car. His excitement was catching and I got into the passenger seat next to him. “Will do.” Davey told dad before starting up the car and listening to it purr a bit before backing out into the parking lot. “Where you want to go?” “How about a milkshake?” I asked and he laughed. “I thought I was supposed to get rid of my stomach, not make it bigger.” He joked. He was starting to lose weight already. “A little cheating won’t hurt at this point.” I suggested and he nodded. Our choice of Denny’s proved to be disastrous. Unfortunately we didn’t realize that until after we’d sat down and ordered. Marcie came in, draped over Spencer’s arms, along with a gaggle of girls and other guys. “Oh dear, maybe we don’t want to eat here.” Marcie said in a sneer. “We might catch who knows what from those two fags over there.” “Let’s just go.” Mark Spencer said with a glare at us. “They might tell their folks we’re picking on them again and try to get us arrested.” “I think you need to leave.” The shift manager said as he walked up to them and Marcie glared at him before tossing her hair and walking out. The shift manager, a thin man in his early thirties looked over at us but didn’t say anything. We were just finishing up when a woman who’d just paid her bill came rushing back inside. “Does someone have a really dark blue Pontiac parked in the lot?” She asked just as we were getting out of the booth. Davey looked sick suddenly and I felt an urge to start swearing. “It’s mine.” Davey said and she came over towards us. “What’s wrong?” “I’m sorry young man, but a car just drove through the lot and a bunch of kids threw eggs at it.” She said in a huff. “They almost hit my car! What’d you do to get them mad at you?” “I exist.” Davey said miserably and looked at me for a nod before rushing outside. I paid the bill and went to join him in looking at the car. Anger warred with tears on his face as he looked at the car and my heart went out to him. “There’s a car wash just down the street.” I said. “I’ll pay.” “No, you and your family have done enough.” Davey said angrily. “They’re going to fucking pay for this.” “Let it go, Davey.” I urged him gently. “They’re not worth this.” “I don’t fucking deserve this!” He grated angrily. “They’re going to learn to not fuck with me!” “Don’t do something stupid.” I said sharply and he glared at me before taking a deep breath. “Why not?” He asked in a slightly calmer voice. “You really think they’re going to get in trouble for this?” “Spencer’s already off the team, and there was another guy on the team with him when they came into the restaurant.” I reminded Davey. “We can make them pay, but let’s do it the smart way, okay?’ “How’s that?” Davey asked and smirked. “Let’s just think about it for a while and make some plans, okay?” I suggested and he nodded sullenly. “For now, let’s hit the car wash before that egg stains the new paint.” “Okay.” Davey agreed reluctantly. That Saturday he returned from seeing his mother with a worried expression, but he also seemed relieved the first surgery was over. She’d be in the hospital for another three weeks before they did the next one to finish the work, and then she’d be there for another six weeks. It was longer than they’d expected, but the doctors said it would be better this way. Pete came back the next day, but there wasn’t even a hint that Davey should move back there. Dad had told Pete about the fact that Downey had almost sent Davey back to Ceres, and Pete didn’t want that to happen any more than Davey did. He knew damn well that Davey had gotten mixed in with a bad crowd there and didn’t want it to happen again. Twice over the next two weeks Davey or I came back out into the parking lot after school and found our cars had been defaced. Fortunately the damage wasn’t permanent or didn’t require more than a bit of touch-up, but Dad went into the Principal’s office with us following behind him and read the Principal the riot act. Borsch was a good man, and when he found out what was going on he took action. Unfortunately, no one was willing to come forward and admit they’d seen what had happened, but on the Tuesday after the President’s day holiday, two security guards caught Mark Spencer and a friend of his attempting to splatter pink paint over my Mustang. That was really bad news for Mark, who was supposed to go to court the next day on the original charges of vandalizing my car. It was also a reason for Principal Borsch to suspend him for a full week this time, and to tell him one more time and he’d be expelled from school. The other kid, a sophomore, got a three-day suspension. Marcie got caught up in it this time, because the police were able to track down a statement by Mark and prove that she’d bought the paint for them. That meant she was now going to face charges of her own. With him facing new charges, Mark begged for a deal from the DA and they rolled both charges together and he got six months probation along with two hundred hours of community service. Davey’s desire for revenge wasn’t exactly fulfilled, but he let it go after we’d learned of Mark’s punishment. The next day, it was all over school that he’d dumped Marcie, who immediately tried to replace him with a guy from the football team, but he told her to get real. For the next two weeks, she got more and more frustrated as guy after guy turned her down. By the time March came around, she was extremely upset that almost all her friends had deserted her. Our baseball season got off to a slow start, but by the first week of March we were on our way to a decent season. If we played our cards right, we might make the division playoffs. With Davey on the team in the last timeline, we’d clinched the playoffs early on, but this time Davey stayed in the dugout helping make sure we had plenty of Gatorade, or making sure everyone’s favorite bat was ready, or keeping the stats for the coaches who preferred to just watch the action than actually write things down. As the days and weeks flew by, I realized that I really did love this Davey Jones on his own terms, and not just because of the man I’d spent my life with in the last timeline. This Davey was a lot rougher around the edges, but he had the same quick wit, the same sense of humor, and the low but urgent drive to prove himself in anything he did. My original Davey had tried to say he didn’t have to prove himself to the world, but the truth was he’d constantly worked to prove himself even if he didn’t realize what he was doing. Dad left his job at the bank in mid-February and started with his new firm. At night he’d sit in the dining room and cuss as he tried to type up his handwritten notes. After the first two nights, Davey had quietly gotten up and offered to help him, taking over the typewriter. His fingers flew over the keys, and Dad’s memos came out letter-perfect. Davey was officially hired to help dad out for two hours per night, and a few hours on the weekend at a rate of pay that bordered on scandalous, although it really was the same rate that they were paying a clerk in the Bay Area. Davey had tried refusing money for an ‘allowance’, but he couldn’t refuse the offer of pay when Dad insisted this time. Two or three times a week he’d go to his grandparent’s house and have dinner with his grandfather, his sister, and whatever other family was there. I went with him a couple of times, but he went alone mostly. Trevor and Brandon came by more, working out with us a few times and other times just hanging around. Mom had taken Davey on two shopping trips, and although he tried to stop her from buying him clothes, and stuff for ‘his’ bedroom, she walked all over him and got her way. Things were going so smoothly right up until Darlene, who was in a class with both of us, asked Davey out on a date. For a moment, I thought he was going to accept, but he declined her offer politely, claiming that while his mother was in the hospital he didn’t want to start dating because he couldn’t give a girl the attention she deserved. Oh yes, he could be smooth when he wanted. As his mother went through her second surgery, and struggled to recover from what was obviously a painful ordeal, Davey came into my room late at night, and crawled wordlessly into my bed. He wanted, no needed, a shoulder to cry on, and as I’d told him I would be, I was there for him, letting him pour out his grief and holding him tightly. We woke the next morning, spooned together, and my body ached for more than the emotional closeness we were experiencing, but I kept that desire under control. I wasn’t blind to the looks he gave me from time to time, the looks of desire when he thought I didn’t see him. It wasn’t something he showed any inclination to talk about though, and the few times I tried to bring up the topic of gay people, he shut down completely. In mid-March, we had a game against a team from Hughson at their field, and we rode with the team on a bus down to the small town just south of Modesto. We won the game easily, and there was a lot of celebration on the bus ride back. Davey sat next to me near the middle of the bus, we talked all the way back to the school where most of the team went into the locker room to change. Not Davey and I though, because we joined Trevor and Brandon in heading to Trevor’s house where his parents were gone for the weekend. Brandon, Trevor and I were still wearing our game uniforms, dark blue shirts with gray pants and blue stirrups while Davey wore his team shirt and a pair of jeans. The rest of the team was changing into their clothes and going to dinner, but we’d basically snuck out so we could celebrate with a bottle of champagne that Trevor had procured and hidden in the loft of his barn. A little voice in my head was warning me that something might happen, given the looks Brandon and Trevor had been sharing most of the bus ride back to Modesto, and the looks Davey had been sending my way, and with plenty of alcohol and no dinner, that little voice was a shout that I tried not to listen to right then. “Dude, you so have to play football next year.” Trevor was saying to Davey when we’d finished most of the bottle. Davey and I were leaning against the rough wood of the barn wall, our legs splayed out in front of us, and his right leg was almost touching my left. The buzz of the champagne filled my head and I put my arm around his shoulders. He leaned into me with a sigh, and his hand landed on my leg, which he squeezed through the uniform pants I was wearing. My shoes had long since been kicked off, as had everyone else’s. Across from Davey and I, Brandon and Trevor were leaning against a hay bail and each other in poses similar to us. Brandon noticed Davey’s hand and smiled as Trevor finished the champagne and threw the empty bottle between us. “I’m not that good.” Davey demurred. “You have to at least try.” Brandon asserted with a slight slur. “We’ll help you practice over the summer, won’t we Brian?” “Yeah, we will.” I agreed and looked sideways at Davey. Most of the stomach he’d had was gone now, thanks to our regular running and workout on the weights at home, as well as P.E. “Okay, I think it’s time for true confessions.” Trevor murmured a few moments later. “What’s that?” Davey asked, trying to sit up straighter, and pushing down on my leg as he struggled to brace himself. I was getting hard at the contact with him, and my pants were tenting up a bit in front. “It’s time we all lay our deepest secrets to bare.” Trevor giggled and leaned into Brandon. I was surprised when their lips locked and they kissed deeply. “Oh fuck.” Davey said with wide eyes, and he took his hand off my leg to cover his crotch. This wasn’t exactly how I imagined this happening, but part of me had begun to wonder if maybe I wasn’t being a bit too obsessive about making my first time with Davey so ‘special’. “You should put your hand back where it was.” I whispered into Davey’s ear, leaning in closer to him. “It felt good there.” “Brian, don’t.” Davey almost whimpered as he turned to face me. There was a look of fear in his eyes, and we both tuned out Trevor and Brandon to look at each other. “Why not?” I asked, lifting a finger to run along his jawline. “Like Trevor said, it’s time for true confessions. You’ve done it before, haven’t you? With a guy?” “Don’t.” Davey whispered as tears formed in his eyes. “I can’t… you won’t… it’s all too perfect. I knew it had to end.” “What can’t you do?” I asked him. “I can’t just fucking do it with you the way I did with them.” He said with a jerk of his head to Brandon and Trevor where Brandon was pulling Trevor’s hard cock out of his uniform pants and going down on him. “Why not?” I asked him softly, ignoring my two friends who seemed to find a renewed attraction to each other after dumping their girlfriends. “Because I don’t want sex with you.” He said and looked away as my heart plummeted into the depths of my abdomen. How could he not be attracted to me? “You don’t think I’m good looking?” I asked him in wounded pride. “It’s not that.” Davey said with a sigh and he looked back at me. “I can’t be gay, what would my grandfather think? Or my mother?” “They’ll get over it in time.” I said with a slight shrug. “They love you Davey, and they’ll learn to accept that part of you as well, eventually. I won’t lie, it won’t be easy, but they will. Trust me.” “I do trust you.” He said and he leaned his forehead into me so that his was touching mine, and his hand reached out to rub along my leg. His body shivered as he did that, and mine did as well at the touch. “The problem is, I think I love you, Brian, and I can’t just have sex with you and pretend it never happened.” “Good.” I said so intently that he jerked his head back to stare at me with wide, surprised eyes. “Good?” He asked in confusion. “Yeah, it’s good.” I said in a husky voice and leaned in to kiss him. When he tried to pull his head back, my hand reached up and pulled his head towards me. As our lips met and my tongue teased against his lips, he let out a whimper that turned into a moan and as his mouth opened and my tongue snaked in against his, he moved quickly to pull me down with him until he was flat on his back amongst the hay on the floor, and I was laying on top of him. His hands roamed over my butt, kneading it and grasping it with passion while his tongue caressed mine oh so gently. I could feel his hard cock pushing out against mine, and moaned when he pulled his lips away from mine. There was a passion burning in his eyes and I smiled at the look of desire in there. “Why the fuck is it good, Brian?” Davey whispered forcefully as his eyes burned with fear and passion both at the same time. “Why the fuck is it good that I love you and I want to be with you the way two men can’t be, like normal people, get married?” “Because I love you too, Davey.” I said with a fierce passion burning in my throat and stinging tears into my eyes. “I don’t care what society or the church says, I want to spend my life with you, just you, forever. Do you hear that? I don’t care what anyone else says, just what you say and what I say, that’s all that really fucking matters. I want you.” “God forgive me.” Davey whimpered as he closed his eyes, and when he opened them they shined in a sky blue color that spoke of his love for me, and our lips tingled with electricity when they met again. “Holy fuck, I’m gonna cum just watching that.” Trevor’s voice was husky, and barely registered on my mind as Davey’s hands began undoing my belt buckle. It was much later that night before we stumbled back into the house. My gray pants had hay stuck in them, as did Davey’s hair, and we were both glad that the parents were already in bed. This time, when Davey stripped my uniform off of me, he did it slowly, as if he was unwrapping a precious and fragile present, and we explored each other for the third time that night, and the first time in my bed. Before, in that other time, we’d gone slowly, building up to the first time we had anal intercourse with each other, but this time I was buried deep in him on that first night, there in my bed. He whimpered and moaned in pleasure as I used all my decades of experience to prove to him I was the best lover he could ever imagine having. By the time we fell asleep, with me still buried inside of him and my bed a total mess, with a room that reeked of sex, the sun had begun to climb above the horizon. “Good morning.” I said a few hours later when Davey opened his eyes. I’d pulled out of him when I’d woken, and spent the minutes watching his face. His eyes held a hint of fear in them, until I leaned forward and kissed his lips softly. “Oh thank god.” Davey said softly. “It wasn’t a dream?” “You mean us telling each other that we love each other and fucking like rabbits?” I asked and he blushed before shyly nodding. “Nope, not a dream. Just remember you’re mine now. Don’t think you can get away just because I haven’t put a ring on this finger.” “We shouldn’t do this.” Davey whispered. “It’s wrong. What will your parents say?” “They’ll say it’s about time I showed some maturity and picked a good person to spend the rest of my life with.” I said fiercely and he gulped. “You mean that?” He asked. “I mean, my parents said they’d be there forever, and look what happened to them?” “My parents are still together, so let’s base our relationship on them, okay?” I asked and he looked at me for a long moment before nodding. “I’m scared.” He said with a shiver and held me tight against him. I was sore down there, but already getting erect again at the touch of him against me. “I am too, but we’ll get through this together, okay?” I asked and he nodded. “Brian, is Davey in there with you?” Dad asked as he knocked on the door. Davey looked scared shitless and tried to grab the blanket so he could hide under it, but given the way the room smelled of sex, if Dad opened the door it would be hopeless. “Yeah, he is.” I called out. “Oh good, by the way, you should really come out here.” Dad said with an edge to his voice. “There’s a message on the answering machine you should listen to real soon. If Davey’s asleep still, let him sleep it off.” “We’ll be out in just a minute.” I called out and waited until he’d moved off before getting out of bed and getting dressed quickly. What could the message be about? Brandon had stayed over at Trevor’s last night. Was it something else, or just someone from the team? “Dude, you look good in those.” I said when I realized Davey had pulled on my game pants from last night. He blushed and pulled them off, picking up a pair of gray sweatpants he’d mistaken the uniform for being. I had to push the sight out of my mind as I was wearing a blue pair of sweatpants and my erection was painfully obvious. It didn’t go down, though, until Davey came in and pulled the front of my sweatpants down to engulf the erection in his throat. All it took was for me to hit the back of his throat and my body jerked in an orgasm as I pulled roughly on his hair. He stood back up with a smile, gave my lips a quick peck and sauntered out the door, claiming the bathroom while I panted and stared after him while the sounds of his pissing could be faintly heard. With a shake of my head I went to the kitchen where Mom pointed to the answering machine without saying a word. She looked pissed, and I knew the call was something bad. While I hesitated with my finger over the play button, a grinning Davey came into the kitchen and got a glass before going to the fridge to pour a glass of orange juice. Mom glared at me again and motioned once more to the machine, and I pushed the button. When the machine began to play, I groaned at the sounds of female weeping. ‘Bbbrrr…Brian, this is Marcie.” She blubbered and I resisted the urge to hit delete. “We need to talk. I’m pregnant and it’s yours.” Davey’s glass shattering on the floor was a sound that reverberated through my mind as I felt my life crashing down around me. Chapter 11 “We should have an attorney here for this.” I muttered as I picked at the tie I was wearing. It was later in the afternoon on Sunday. Davey had left to go visit his grandfather and his sister as soon as he could leave. He hadn’t spoken to me at all, and I saw the hurt look on his face, like he’d been betrayed, and part of me understood that feeling in him. My parents and I had sat down for a heavy conversation after which Dad had called Marcie’s father, who had spent the first part of the conversation yelling at my father before agreeing to come over with his wife and daughter. Now we were all dressed up, waiting for them to arrive. Dad had dressed in his business suit, and I was wearing a dress shirt and tie as well as slacks while mom was wearing a similar suit to Dad’s except with a skirt. There had been some actual arguing, but I’d won the right to lead the conversation once they were here and sitting down, while Dad had won that we’d face them as a family first, without an attorney. This was a serious situation, all of us knew, and not something to be taken lightly. “Brian, we all agreed that we’ll start this like civilized people without resorting to attorneys.” Dad said and I bristled at the unspoken implication attorneys weren’t civilized. I’d been an attorney for most of my adult life, albeit I hadn’t practiced family law, ever. It would have been nice to consult some legal books for case histories, but there wasn’t access to any at this time. “I know.” I said anxiously as there was the sound of a car pulling up. When they rang the doorbell, and dad opened it, I knew this wasn’t going to be a fun exercise. Marcie was dressed to the hilt with a tight dress that showed off her bosom, a diamond necklace and earrings that were probably the ones that my other self had bought for her before I came back in time. She showed a firm expression on her face. Her father looked like he was going to hit me before he nodded at my father. He was wearing jeans and a flannel shirt while Marcie’s mother was wearing a simple but nice dress. “Mr. and Mrs. Ellsworth, please come in.” Dad said politely. “Would you like some tea, juice, or maybe some water?” Mom asked politely and all three of them shook their heads as Dad led us into the dining room. Marcie tried to reach out to grab my arm but I quickened my pace a bit so she couldn’t reach me without being too obvious. Dad sat down at the head of the table with Mr. Ellsworth at the other end. Mom sat on Dad’s right and I sat on his left. Marcie started to cross down to sit next to me before her father glared at her and she shifted to sit on the same side of the table as me but next to him. “Your son has gone and gotten my daughter pregnant, Breckenridge.” Mr. Ellsworth spat the words out like gunfire from a machine gun. “I want to know what you’re going to do about it.” “I’m going to listen to what my son has to say, and what your daughter has to say as well.” Dad said in a firm, even tone and Ellsworth bristled at that while his wife looked slightly uncomfortable. Ellsworth was a big bear of a man with dark bushy hair and a bushy beard while she was much smaller, although slightly plump and had mousy brown hair. How Marcie had gotten her looks from them I wasn’t quite sure, but some of her attitude could be explained by her father’s bearish manner. Then again, this was the first time that I had ever met the man. “What is there to say?” Ellsworth demanded harshly. “He got her pregnant and now he has to do the right thing. That’s all there is to say.” “How far along is the pregnancy according to the doctor?” I asked in a neutral tone, drawing their eyes to me and I noticed how Marcie squirmed. “She hasn’t been to a doctor yet.” Mr. Ellsworth fumed. “We can’t afford the bill. You’ll have to pay for this.” “If she is pregnant, and if the child is mine, then yes I’ll be responsible for her pre-natal related medical expenses.” I said, ignoring the looks of faint surprise on the faces of my mother and father and focusing on the outrage on Mr. Ellsworth’s face. “A woman knows if she’s pregnant!” Mrs. Ellsworth spoke up for the first time looking at me with angry indignation while her husband roared. “What do you mean if it’s yours? Of course it’s yours!” “With all due respect to you as a mother, Mrs. Ellsworth, your daughter has proven herself to be a lying and manipulative young women with no hint of a conscience or morals.” I said and ignored Mr. Ellsworth’s roar of anger and his slapping the table before demanding an apology from me. “Mr. Ellsworth, calm down before you become the second member of your family to have the police called after attempting to damage the property of me and my family.” “What are you talking about?” Mrs. Ellsworth asked as her husband’s face turned purple and my dad looked at me with surprise and worry. “Don’t tell me you don’t know your daughter was arrested for trying to vandalize my car.” I asked with a lift of my eyebrow. “She told me that was just a misunderstanding.” She said with a frown. “It was just a joke that got out of hand.” “Ma’am, with all due respect, your daughter lied to you.” I said. “I did not!” Marcie cried out. “I just got a little overwrought and you got upset. You told me you loved me and would spend the rest of your life with me and then you changed and dropped me and now I’m pregnant with your baby!” “You may be pregnant, with a child that may not be mine.” I said coldly and she started to cry, drawing an angry look at me from her father who put an arm around her. “Who else would it be?” He demanded angrily. “Let’s see, Marcie has bragged at school about having slept with Mark Spencer after she broke up with me, and I saw her giving fellatio to him in his car so that’s a real possibility.” I said casually and Marcie shouted her innocence while her dad roared at me that I was lying. “Then, of course, while she was dating him, she told her friend she was also sleeping with Chad Kipple. Then my friends have told me that even while she was dating me she cheated on me with two other guys, neither of whom attend our high school.” “You liar!” Mr. Ellsworth roared, pointing a meaty finger at me. “You deflowered her, stole her virginity. She told me that herself! She’s never been in a serious relationship with anyone but you!” “Mr. Ellsworth, if there is one thing I’m certain of it is that your daughter has never had a serious relationship with anyone or anything, and most especially she’s not even a passing acquaintance of the truth. She’s a natural-born liar.” “How dare you!” Marcie wailed. “This is all the fault of that creep you’ve been hanging around, the one who convinced you to break up with me.” “Can you not tell the truth even now?” I asked with scorn in my voice. “Or have you really forgotten that you dumped me and told me I’d have to come crawling on my knees to get you back.” “I did not!” She exclaimed before burying her face in her heads and shaking her shoulders with what I was sure were fake sobs. “Now look at what you’ve done!” Mrs. Ellsworth wailed while getting up and going around to her daughter and pulling her in tightly so that Marcie buried her face against her mother’s bosom while Mrs. Ellsworth glared at me. “And to think I thought you were such a nice boy!” “To think I thought your daughter cared about anyone or anything other than herself.” I snorted and my dad touched my arm in a warning gesture. “Be that as it may, here is what I am prepared to offer. First off, we’ll set up a trust account to cover any pre-natal bills if the child is proven to be mine. Second, if and only if a paternity test comes back positive that I’m the father, we will arrange child support payments until the child is eighteen, if she is granted custody of the child by the courts.” “What do you mean if the child is yours?” Marcie’s father demanded. “It can’t be anyone’s but yours.” “We’ll see when the paternity test is done.” I said firmly. “Brian, just marry me and we won’t have to worry about any of this.” Marcie said as she pulled her face out of mother’s bosom. “You said you loved me, why won’t you just marry me?” “If I ever loved you, what you’ve done since January has cured me of that forever.” I said to her coldly and she let out a wail. “I wouldn’t want a little piece of shit like you as a son-in-law anyway.” Mr. Ellsworth snarled as he stood up. “You’ll be hearing from our attorney.” “You’ll be hearing from ours as well.” My father said as he also stood up. “It’ll start with a lawsuit requiring your daughter to submit to an exam by a qualified physician to determine if your daughter really is pregnant. Then it’ll require a paternity test, and you better pray Brian is the father, because if he isn’t, we’ll sue you for libel and defamation of character and take every damn penny you have.” “Oh yeah, well you’ll be sorry your family ever crossed paths with mine!” Ellsworth roared before bustling his daughter and wife out of the house. Dad followed them and Mom let out a long breath while shaking her head. “Brian, I wish you’d never gotten involved with that girl.” She said softly and I chortled softly. “So do I, Mom, so do I.” I agreed with her fervently. “Brian, I don’t know what you think you were doing, but calling a man’s daughter a slut to his face does not make you friends.” Dad said as he reentered the room and sat down. “Dad, I knew that if Marcie’s parents were anything like her, giving them an inch would have been as good as giving them the whole game.” I said. “Do you think the child’s yours?” Dad asked and I shrugged. “I sure as hell hope not.” I said. “I promise one thing though, nothing like this will ever happen again.” “I sure hope not.” Dad said and he gave me a long look. He took a swallow as if he was nervous and I realized he had probably figured me and Davey out. “I’d much rather have Davey as part of the family than anyone like that.” “So would I, Dad.” I said as Mom watched me for my reaction. There was nervousness in my gut, but they both nodded slowly. “You might want to open a window next time he spends the night in your room.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Yeah.” I agreed with a blush of my cheeks. “So, is this… thing with him serious?” Dad asked. “Have you two actually… talked? How long has it been going on?” “It’s very serious, at least on my part and I’m pretty sure on his as well.” I said softly. “He’s probably hurting right now from all this other stuff, I think that’s why he left like that. We’ve talked a little, but not enough, and as for how long, last night was the first time.” “I’ve always said you were a lot like your Uncle Rich.” Mom said with a shake of her head and a penetrating look at me. “Is that why you were with that… that girl? You were still upset over Uncle Rich and didn’t want to be like him.” “You really do know me.” I said with a sad smile and she nodded. “I can understand that, son, but you can see what a mess this is.” Dad said with a sad shake of his head. “Don’t get me wrong, we’ll always love you, but you have to know we’re disappointed in you over this whole mess, and you’ve hurt Davey. I’m not sure you and him… getting to know each other better at this point was necessarily a good thing.” “The timing could be better, but that’s par for the course.” I said with a shrug remembering all the times that life had intruded on my life with Davey. Something moved into place inside of me and I knew it was time to tell all my secrets, or nearly all of them. “Mom, Dad, we need to talk, about a couple of things, not just this, but I’d like Davey to be there. He’s an important part of my life.” “When he gets back, or tomorrow evening after school we can all talk.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “Until then, how about we stick our heads in the sand?” “That sounds good to me.” Mom said with a sigh of her own and I nodded my agreement. I didn’t quite ignore things the rest of the day, since I called both Brandon and Trevor to tell them what was going on with Marcie. Both of them were outraged, and promised to support me if I needed their help. That helped a bit, that they were sticking by me now. It was hard to admit to myself that I had missed them as much as I really had. Davey never came home that night. He did call to tell Mom that he’d be staying over at his grandparents. Mom tried to get him to promise to come over after school, but he backed away from that commitment. It hurt, but I had faith that we’d manage to work through this problem like any other I’d ever experienced with Davey. All night I tossed and turned, thinking about things and how to explain them to him, and to my parents. When dawn came, I’d slept very little and got up in a tired state that not even a shower and a short morning run could quite solve. Even as I pulled into the parking lot it felt like everyone was staring at me and whispering behind their hands. Had Marcie shouted it from the hilltops that I’d gotten her pregnant? I was surprised when I walked between a row of classrooms and the gym to find someone waiting for me. Katie looked nervous, and kept on looking around as if to make sure no one saw her talking to me.",

      "content": "“If he hadn’t done this to Jenny then poor Davey wouldn’t have to live like this.” Monta was saying and I winced slightly. “Oh yes, it’s all his fault.” Davey’s voice dripped sarcasm and anger and I tried to look away so I wouldn’t see the look of hurt on his mother’s face.“It’s not like he was the one who told me we were going on a vacation for a few days when we were really leaving forever and didn’t even give me the chance to say goodbye to my friends.” “David Ray Jones Jr., how dare you say that?” His grandmother fumed. “Your mother did the right thing getting you away from that beast of a man!I should have made her do it years ago when I saw him beat you.” “He didn’t beat me.” Davey shot back angrily and I wondered if there was anything I could say to calm this situation down. It made me decidedly uncomfortable to be stuck like this, torn between the hurt I knew Davey felt and the pain I saw in the eyes of the two women.There was nothing I needed to do, though, as the sound of a baby crying came from the back of the house. “Now look what you’ve done!” Davey’s mother complained as Monta got up and hurried back into the house, muttering about Davey waking up the baby. “Then maybe it’s good I’ll be gone until tomorrow at least.” Davey said sourly.His face did soften as his mother looked hurt, though.“I love you, Mom.” “I love you too, Davey.” His mother said softly and the look of hurt faded a bit from her face. “It was nice to meet you, ma’am.” I said softly, and she returned my smile briefly before nodding. “Let’s get going.” Davey said in a voice that was so conflicted with emotion that I couldn’t quite place all of them. I followed him out of the house and we got into the car before I drove off, heading back up to Modesto. He was silent and brooding again, but now it was about things other than his car. As much as I wanted to comfort him, I also knew that a part of the problem was more than his family’s actions towards him, but his reactions to the situation they were in, and I would have to think about that.Anyone in his situation would be torn and conflicted, as he obviously was, and I wondered how best to help him.Well, being a good friend was always a good start to any situation like this, and I would always be the best friend any Davey Jones could ask for in life. Chapter 8 While Davey and I spent most of the afternoon working on our history project, Mom and Dad spent the time cleaning out the guest bedroom. The Davey I had known had a hundred years or more of life experiences behind his argumentation skills, but this Davey was just seventeen and showed the diamond in the rough that would become his debating skills later in life. He had some good theories, and we spent most of the time hashing them out. When they paused for lunch, my parents seemed to enjoy listening to Davey and I argue about different ideas for our project. While the discussion grew a little heated at times, Davey seemed happier than he’d been in a while as he focused on something besides the troubles in his life. I understood it was a respite for him, and I wanted to make the most of it for him. “Boys, why don’t you take a break?” My father suggested as we approached dinner time. It was starting to get dark outside and I hadn’t realized so much time had passed. “Brenda and I were thinking of having an adult’s night out, going out to dinner and a movie. Would you like to tag along or do your own thing?” “Has there been any word on my car?” Davey asked with a touch of nervousness. “None since earlier this afternoon.” Dad answered. “They said then it might take a few days to get the parts they needed. I hoped you don’t mind, but Janice came out for a smoke before the tow-truck left and she mentioned to me that you aren’t scheduled for work on Monday or Tuesday.” “That’s right.” Davey said with a frown. “I don’t mind taking you around town and I won’t miss practice since you don’t have to work.” I spoke up immediately and my dad smiled at me. “If you want to make things easier and stay here, the guest room is ready for you.” Dad suggested calmly. “I know it’ll make things easier for Brian, and I imagine with how crowded your grandparents’ house sounds, it won’t be a bad thing for them either.” “I’ll call mom and ask.” Davey said softly. “I’m worried about her; she didn’t look that good this morning.” “She’s going to be fine, Davey.” Dad said reassuringly, and I was surprised to see how Davey’s shoulders slumped in relief a bit. His reaction to my father was different than his reaction to the adults in his family, and I wondered how much the whole mess with his own father was a part of their angry interactions with each other. “Give her a call though. Right now she needs to worry about her own health first and foremost. Let her know you’re doing fine and it’ll help.” “If you say so, Mr. B.” Davey said softly and got up to go use the phone. Dad looked over at me with a look of concern on his face. I’d had a few moments earlier in the day to tell him about what I’d seen at Davey’s ‘home’ during our visit this morning. Davey had been in the bathroom, and that had given me just enough time to share the highlights with Dad. My father had been shocked hearing my description of Davey’s ‘bed’ and while we both knew it was better than being on the street, the total lack of privacy Davey had to live with was shocking to us. “Order a pizza if you guys stay in, okay?” Dad asked and I nodded. “Thank you for doing all this dad.” I said quietly. “I know it’s not like he’s been a family friend for a while or anything, but I really appreciate how much you’re helping him out.” “He’s a good guy.” Dad said softly. “I’d only hope that if you ever were in a situation like his that someone else would do what we’re doing for you. It sounds like his family has a lot of issues to work through, and while they are doing that, they can’t really pay him the attention he needs. We can, and we will.” “Thanks.” I said again and he nodded before heading out to go talk with Mom. Davey came back a moment later with a frown on his face. “What’s wrong?” I asked him and he sighed. “Just Mom being a mom.” He answered cryptically and I let it go at that. “I’m tired of working on the project. How about we do something else?” “I could use a run.” I said and he frowned. “You making another reference to my stomach?” He said defensively and I realized I should have said something else with him already feeling defensive from his conversation with his mother. “No.” I said with a shrug. “I just know that when I’m feeling uptight I like to work out. It helps me, so I thought it might help you.” “It’s better than having a cigarette, I guess.” He said with a shrug and I grimaced. “Yeah, it is.” I agreed with him. “I didn’t bring any running clothes.” He said and I stood up to lead the way to my bedroom. “Don’t worry, we’re the same shoe size and I have an old pair of running shoes and some sweats you can wear.” I assured him. “Jeez, it’s like you’re trying to make me dress all preppy like you.” He said, but there was a hint of humor in his voice. “Well, we’ve got to have you looking your best if you’re going to be my best friend.” I said as we entered my bedroom and I realized he’d stopped in the doorway, looking at me hard. “I thought you already had a best friend.” He said softly, but there was a glistening look in his eyes that sent chills down my spine. “They seem to be more interested in kissing Marcie’s ass instead of being friends with me.” I said with a shrug. “You’re not going to do that, are you? I mean even if she slashes your tires again?” “She can blow up my car and I won’t walk away.” Davey said softly with gleaming eyes locked on mine. “You and your family are the best thing to happen to me in a long time.” “Good, we feel the same way about you.” I said. “Why?” Davey asked and I smiled gently. “You just told me why.” I replied. “You said she could blow up your car, and dude, I know how important a car is to a guy our age, and she wouldn’t be able to keep you from being my friend. Her and I break up, and I find out who my true friends are, and you’re here. That means a lot to me, you know.” “It means a lot what your folks are doing for me, too.” Davey reiterated and I nodded. “So, now we know another part of why we’re friends and you don’t have to doubt why you’re welcome here.” I said with a shrug. “Now let’s get ready for a run.” “Okay.” Davey said with a bit of a grin on his face. We got dressed, and I couldn’t help notice the sly looks he was giving me. I posed when I noticed the looks, and wondered if he realized that I was posing, but didn’t care. Our friendship was developing just fine, and as much as my body was crying for more as I put on my jock, I knew that it would come eventually. He didn’t have his own jock, and for a moment I considered offering one of my spares, but realized that would probably be a little too awkward just now. The only problem with just having the idea though was that I was fully hard at the thought, and suddenly didn’t want him noticing that. I finished getting dressed in a pair of blue Downey sweats and a black t-shirt while he wore a pair of my old blue sweats from freshman year and a yellow t-shirt. “Let’s stretch.” I said when we were dressed and he had finished putting on a pair of my old running shoes. He let out a little sigh at the comfort of them and I felt guilty again at how threadbare his wardrobe was. Come to think of it, the nicest clothes I’d seen him in lately had been those my mother had bought him as a belated birthday gift. A half-mile into the run, he was wheezing something bad, and I was astonished at how out of shape he was. The Davey I’d known would have set double the pace and not even broken into a sweat for the first mile at this age. How much had he been smoking? “Oh god, it’s been so long since I went for a run.” Davey moaned as we slowed to a fast walk and he tried to catch his breath. “How long has it been?” I asked him. “Over a year, since we moved from Nevada.” Davey explained. “That’s bad.” I said with a frown and he nodded. “Let’s pick up the pace.” He said in a determined tone that was very familiar, and very welcome. He had a half-smile on his face as we started jogging, albeit slower than before. “I use to run a lot back in Nevada.” Davey said with a slight wheeze after another half-mile. He was sweating profusely now, but he seemed determined to go on for at least a little more. “I use to do a lot of things in Nevada, for that matter.” “Why’d you stop?” I asked and he shrugged as we finished another half mile and he motioned for us to turn back. Three miles wasn’t exactly a lot, but for his first time out in a year, it was pretty damn good. “A lot of reasons.” Davey wheezed after we’d gone for a bit in silence. I slowed to a walk, and he followed my change of pace, lifting his arms over his head and stretching out while taking deep, steady breaths. We kept moving though, although the pace was just a rapid walk. “Part of it was just being depressed over the whole sack of shit that my life became.” “What happened?” I asked cautiously, not sure if he’d want to share. “I mean, I know what the papers said, but what happened really, for you?” “It sucked.” Davey answered bitterly. “Mom had been sick for a couple weeks with pneumonia and Nanny had come out to Nevada with Papa to care for her. Nanny now thinks Dad had been poisoning Mom, but I don’t really believe that at all. Anyway, Mom got better and the Saturday before Thanksgiving Mom asked me if I wanted to go with them to California for the holiday. I agreed since we weren’t playing any games at school and it was boring stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Dad was the only one who stayed behind. After Thanksgiving, I started asking when we were going back to Nevada, but Mom kept on putting me off saying she wasn’t feeling well.” “That’s not right.” I said, and while I’d heard parts of the story before, I’d never heard it like this or with the anger and venom in his voice. It also explained some facets of Davey’s psyche that I had never really understood before. “No, it wasn’t.” Davey agreed bitterly and picked the pace back up to a slow jog. “It was December before I learned we weren’t going back to Nevada. At first I threw a fit and demanded that if Mom wanted to divorce Dad, that was fine, but I wanted to live in Nevada.” “She didn’t tell you why?” I asked and he shook his head. “Not until they’d already enrolled me at Ceres High just in time for finals that I had no chance to prepare for.” Davey explained. “I got lucky and did alright and with the grades I’d already gotten in Eureka I eked out B’s in most of my classes, but I’d been getting a 3.8 GPA in Nevada, so all B’s kind of fucked me up there. I got real mad one night and told Mom she could either buy me a bus ticket back to Nevada or she could tell me what was really going on, and so she broke down and told me the truth about what Dad had done to Jenny.” “That must have been rough.” I said softly. “I didn’t believe her at first.” Davey said so softly I almost didn’t hear him, and he stopped jogging to turn and face me. There were tears in his eyes again. “How awful was that, my sister gets fucking raped by my own father and I didn’t fucking believe it when Mom told me! I was so fucking angry and so god-damn self-centered that all I cared about was getting back to Nevada and my fucking friends there. When Mom told me, I lost it, accusing her of lying just to keep me from siding with Dad against her. We were sitting in Nanny and Papa’s bedroom, with the door shut although I could hear Nanny hovering outside. Mom picked up the phone and called Dad right then and there, and put me on the phone without saying a word.” “Oh god.” I said fiercely, not believing the details I was hearing. Davey had never shared them with me before, and I wondered if that had been on purpose because of how painful they had been, or unintentional because they no longer hurt so much. Here, in this timeline, Davey’s eyes were leaking tears and his cheeks were flushed from more than our run. “I asked him right out, expecting to hear him deny it so that I could go back home to Nevada where I belonged.” Davey’s shoulders shook with sobs, but his body language was so angry and defensive I knew he didn’t want a hug or comfort. He wanted somebody to listen. Hearing this was so amazing for me, because it hadn’t been something I’d ever discussed with my Davey in detail, and it was like a door was opening to understanding the man I’d loved for decades. “My whole fucking world came crashing down on that phone call. When I told him what mother claimed, I waited for him to tell me it was all a lie. I was so ready to believe that, but he didn’t. All he did was start crying. My fucking father, who I could never remember crying like that, fucking broke down in sobs on the phone and told me how sorry he was. “FUCK YOU DAD!” Davey yelled into the darkening twilight and I shook with my own unshed tears for him. “How the fuck could he do that to her? But you know what’s the worst thing about it all? It’s not just what my fucking father did to my sister, it’s what my mother did to me! Her and my grandparents, and my sister, and everyone around me. Even Shantill, that fucking nitwit, knew what had happened, but could anyone even fucking tell me? No, they fucking lied to me and put me off like I couldn’t handle the truth! You wonder why I’m so mad at them? I saw the look on your face at Nanny’s, you know. That’s why I’m so fucking mad at them. They couldn’t even fucking tell me the goddamn truth about what my father had done to my sister! I had to force them to tell me!” “They were all wrong.” I said softly and he looked at me with fury and passion burning in his eyes. We were jogging along a canal path, empty at this time of year, and the only lights were from the stars, the rising moon, and cars in the distance. While our eyes remained locked on each other, I stepped towards him, and put my hands on his shoulders as my teary eyes bored into his. “They didn’t respect you, but what are you doing now? You’re working, giving them a lot of your hard-earned money to help, why?” “Because they’re my family and I care.” Davey said with an exhaled breath. “How could I turn my back on my sister after what she’s been through? My mother too. I know she didn’t do right by me, but I know why she did it. It hurt, and she was afraid I’d still go back to him even knowing the truth. It hurts she didn’t trust me, but she’s still my mother and I know she loves me.” “You’re a good guy, Davey Jones.” I said softly and he blushed slightly. “No, don’t be embarrassed. I don’t know many guys would go through what you’ve been through and still care a bit about his family.” “I’m not all that good.” Davey said softly as he looked at the cars in the distance. It was getting chilly out, and the fact that we’d been sweating didn’t help, but neither of us wanted to move at this moment. “You want to know another reason why Papa doesn’t let me in after eleven-thirty? It’s because last year at Ceres I got mixed up with stoners. I’d stay out late with them getting drunk and stoned. It felt good to let go, to forget my problems and drift along all numb to the pain. That’s why they really helped me get into Downey, to get me away from those guys, but it didn’t really work. Most of the money I have left over I spend getting pot for them and me and alcohol for Ronna or Jeannette when I can’t hang around the stoners. So you see, I’m not really a good guy.” “Bullshit.” I snapped angrily, not just at the fact that he was doing drugs and drinking like mad at times. His eyes snapped back to me at the word, and I locked gazes with him. “Good people can make bad decisions without becoming bad themselves.” “Tell it to Mrs. Dent.” He said and I almost lost the reference until I remembered the junior high math teacher who taught positive/negative multiplication with a silly reference to bad things happening to good people being a bad thing, and bad things happening to bad people being a good thing. “Real life is more complicated than that.” I reminded him and he looked at me as if he was longing to hear the next words out of my mouth. “I know it hurts, Davey.” “How could you?” Davey asked angrily as he pulled away from me and crossed his arms to stare at me in his anger. “You’ve got the perfect fucking family, Brian. Your parents, most people would kill to have parents like them. God knows I would sell my soul for parents like them, so what the fuck could you know about hurting?” “I had a favorite uncle.” I said slowly, trying to mix the truth with the reality of this timeline without outright lying to Davey. Building a relationship on a foundation of lies was a bad thing, or should I just tell him the full truth right now? Was he ready for that? “Uncle Rich and I use to do a lot of things together and he was like this god-figure when I was younger. He could do no wrong, and I loved talking to him on the phone, and visiting him.” “Let me guess, he died in an accident or something?” Davey sneered and for a moment I felt really angry at him. “He died of AIDS back in 1981, just after Christmas.” I said softly, and truthfully. Davey’s face contorted in a mix of emotions before he frowned at me. “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “Did he get it through a blood transfusion?” “No, he caught it because his partner liked to sleep around.” I said bitterly and he frowned before his eyes widened. “Don’t you dare say something about ‘fags’ or ‘queers’ either, Davey Jones. He was my uncle and I loved him. He should fucking be alive right now!” “I’m sorry.” Davey said softly. “That’s not all.” I said fiercely, wanting to make sure he did realize that I could understand hurt and loss. “Every Thanksgiving we usually go see my grandparents back east. This last time, the fucking bitch Marcie decided to have me spend time with her family and like an idiot, I agreed. My grandparents decided to come out here and they fucking died in a car accident on the I-5 in heavy fog, all because I listened to my bitch of a girlfriend.” “Shit.” Davey said and this time he stepped closer to me, and I could feel his hands on my arms as more tears came to my eyes. Yes, it hadn’t been me exactly who had done that, made those decisions, or had watched Uncle Rich die, but in many ways it really had been me and if the choices I had made had not created this timeline, they’d have never happened. Someday I’d tell him that part of all this. “Yeah, shit.” I said bitterly. “So, you know, Davey Jones, my little life isn’t perfect after all. Yes I’ve got damn fucking good parents, but that doesn’t guarantee me a perfect little life.” “I’m sorry.” He said softly. “I got so wrapped up in me that…” “Yeah, well, let’s head home.” I said, turning to wrap my arm around his shoulder and he sagged against me as we began walking back to the house. We walked in silence, but it was a good silence. When we were getting closer to the house, I dropped my arm and we walked next to each other. “Your uncle, your parents knew he was…gay and still let you around him?” Davey asked as we got near the house, and part of me cheered that he’d brought up the first conversation between us about gay people. That was something I knew we’d have to work on if there was to be more between us than friendship or just sex. “Yeah, they know gay people aren’t like some pervert or something.” I said with a shrug. “My uncle was just a man who happened to like other men. That didn’t mean he was going to go all pervo on me.” “No, that’s something people like my father do.” Davey said bitterly and I felt guilty for a moment. “No, don’t say you’re sorry, Brian, it’s just… I’ve never thought about it like that before. My father would have a shit-fit if he thought about me being around someone like that. Hell for that matter so would the rest of my family.” “What do you think about it?” I asked him and he gave me a long look. “You obviously aren’t freaked out about people like that.” Davey said softly. “No, I’m not.” I said with a shrug. “It’s a fact of life, either you are that way or you’re not. It’s just, with Uncle Rich, it was a part of who he was, but it wasn’t all of who he was. You know what I mean?” “I think so.” Davey said with a frown as we walked up the driveway and into the house. Mom and Dad were already gone and Davey looked at me as we stood in the entryway of the house. He wanted to say something, but he hesitated. “Don’t get this the wrong way, but what if like, oh yeah, maybe like what if you had a brother and he turned out to be… gay? How would your parents react?” “Dude, my parents told me when I was twelve that if I liked boys instead of girls they were fine with that as long as I loved them and treated them right.” I said with a laugh. “Oh.” Davey said with wide eyes and shake of his head. “I’m going to take a shower, okay?” “Okay.” I said. “I’ll order the pizza?” “Uh, sure.” Davey said. “How’s pepperoni and sausage?” I asked. “Sounds good.” He said and headed off into the bathroom. I found I was humming to myself as I looked up the pizza company in the yellow pages. It was an old song for me, but a song that hadn’t come out until well after 2010. While trying to find the pizza company I liked, I realized how much I missed things like the internet and instant access to information. There were other things I missed too, like On the Border restaurants and big bookstores, but so far, there was one thing I didn’t miss. He was in my bathroom taking a shower right now. That evening we ate pizza, played chess, and talked. We weren’t interested in going out for anything, so we stayed in and we talked. Davey talked about Nevada, and the things he’d done there, and I could hear in his voice how much he missed playing football. It was obvious that he hadn’t gone out for the football team at Downey last September because he was afraid of failing to make the team as much as because he needed to work. It wasn’t all him talking though, and I found myself walking a fine line between my memories of my original timeline and the experiences of this timeline’s Brian. It wasn’t easy, but by the time midnight rolled around, we were both ready for bed, and I felt like we’d made a lot of progress in getting to know each other. “Thanks for everything.” Davey said quietly before rushing in to give me a hug when we were heading towards the bedroom. I returned the hug, and he blushed before heading into the guest bedroom. Part of me wanted to invite him to spend the night in my room again, but there was a look in his eyes that told me he liked the idea of staying in a room by himself. Mom and Dad returned sometime after midnight, and I woke up just enough to realize it was them coming home before rolling over and going back to sleep. I was up a little after seven in the morning, and I was slightly surprised to see Davey up as well. He’d told me how he liked to sleep in on weekends, and in that he wasn’t that different than the Davey I had known. “You going running this morning?” Davey asked me softly since my parents were still asleep. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt since it was slightly chilly, and he probably mistook that for meaning I was going running. There was a look in his eyes like he wanted the answer to be yes, so I changed my plan of fixing a bowl of cereal into a plan for going running. “Sure, you want to join me?” I asked him and he smiled. “I’m not sure if I want to, but I know I should.” He said with a low chuckle. “Last night proved that I need to exercise more.” “Cool, let me get you a sweatshirt.” I said as I turned to go back in my room. He was wearing the sweatpants from last night, so he was fine there, and I saw he had my old pair of running shoes on as well. “Dude, I’m borrowing so many of your clothes it’s like a good thing we’re so close in size.” He said and I chuckled. “Anytime you want to borrow something of mine, you just take it.” I told him and he blushed slightly as I threw him a green sweatshirt and he pulled it on over his head. “I don’t think I’ve ever known someone close enough to my sizes to share clothes like this.” Davey said. “It’s kind of weird.” “It’s kind of cool.” I responded. “I’ve never really known someone my size either. Brandon’s close to my height, but he’s skinny as a reed.” “Yeah, he is.” Davey agreed with a hint of sourness. We stretched without too much chatter, and this morning I let him set the pace. It started off slow, but he picked it up as we finished the three-mile run, and while he was breathing heavily, he was also smiling broadly. The adult part of me knew it was because he’d set a goal and completed it successfully. Davey liked achieving goals in his life, but he usually set them so high there was no way he could achieve them, and that failure would make him feel depressed. During the morning, my father drafted the two of us to help him clean up a lot of the clutter they’d cleared out of the guest bedroom, and to help him rearrange the stuff in the garage. After a bunch of talk, my weight equipment was moved to the back patio to make room for more of mom’s stuff in the garage. Being included in the task of helping move things relaxed Davey as he felt like he was helping to ‘work off’ what he felt he owed my father. After lunch I dropped him off at work before returning home. It was time for the third degree of questioning from both Dad and Mom as they wanted to know everything they could get out of me about Davey. They both liked him a lot, and the more I shared, the more they grew to look worried about him, and at the same time a bit hopeful. “I wish we could adopt him.” Mom said softly before looking at me. “You wouldn’t mind that, would you Brian?” “He’s got his own family, even if they’re all messed up right now.” Dad reminded her. “It’s more like he just needs a safe place to be himself. We can do that, certainly. Plus, I’ll drop by the apartment in S.F. when his mom’s having surgery. I’ll be able to chat with his grandmother then and get more perspective on everything. From what you said, Brian, she at least understands some of how this might be hard on David and want to help in any way she can. Plus, I’ll probably see Pete in the bank and we can talk about that fishing trip. I wasn’t sure what to think about him, but you seem certain he’s got David’s best interests at heart.” “He’s reacting the only way he really knows how, trying to keep Davey out of trouble.” I hadn’t flat out told them about Davey’s admission of drug use, but they’d taken the hints. Drugs was something guaranteed to get them upset, but at the same time, they were also smart enough to know that if Davey was willing to tell me about it, he was willing to at least listen to someone talking to him about stopping it. “What’s the real story with his car?” I asked dad, who frowned at me. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, dad, I know it won’t take a few days for the starter to come in.” I said and he smiled with a shake of his head. “I should have known you’d have figured that out.” He replied. “I’m having that front fender fixed from where it was all bent up. Do you know how that happened?” “Yeah, he was following someone too closely and reacted too late when they stopped in front of him.” I answered. “It was late and he’d been working a couple of shifts at a couple of restaurants.” “He works too hard for minimum wage.” Dad said. “I know he actually makes about a dollar above minimum wage.” I said with a shrug. “That’s still too little for working so much.” Mom frowned as she spoke her mind. “Can’t he get a better job?” “It was the first job he got offered.” I said with a shrug, having put together a couple of pieces of that story from our conversation last night. “I think he’s really scared of rejection, and he took the first thing that came along so he wouldn’t have to face rejection from somewhere else, and that’s why he’s not really interested in looking for other work.” “Does he have any other skills?” Mom asked with concern. “Do you know if he can type or anything like that?” “Yeah, he can type.” I answered. “He told me he took typing classes in Nevada and at Ceres High and passed the proficiency test with a typing speed of forty-five words per minute. They also taught filing and stuff like that.” “Then why doesn’t he try to get a job in an office?” Mom asked. “Probably because most of those types of jobs are during the day, not evenings and weekends like fast food.” Dad answered. “He might make more per hour doing that work, but he won’t have as many hours and that means he’ll make less overall.” “I hadn’t thought about that.” Mom stated. “I just want to thank you both for being so nice to him.” I said quietly and Dad shook his head while Mom smiled. “We’ve been lucky with you, overall, Brian.” Dad said. “Actually, we’ve been lucky all our lives, and I don’t think I could live with myself if we didn’t help someone like David when the situation presented itself to us.” “I guess we’re just old-fashioned liberals at heart.” Mom said with a fond smile for Dad, and I tried not to imagine where the smile might lead. After Davey got off work, he and I went out to dinner at a Lyon’s restaurant before I took him back to his grandmother’s. He was happier than I’d seen him in a while, and spent most of dinner telling me about some crazy customers that had come through his restaurant that day. It was an enjoyable evening, and I was sorry he was going back home, but I could also see the worried look in his eyes when he mentioned his mother. Monta insisted that I come in when she saw us pull up. She was outside with her great-granddaughter, Whitney, who was now just over a year old. Shantill was apparently out on a date, but Jenny was there, as was Davey’s mother. Jenny was far different than the girl I’d known in the last timeline. She was a little plumper, and lacked the drive and determination that had led her to being a fighter pilot and eventually the commanding general of an entire Air Force base. She’d retired after being the first female general to sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and very nearly being the first female Chair of that important military agency. That didn’t mean she wasn’t lively and interesting, just that it was in a far different way. She was more interested in gossip and what I’d call ‘girlie’ things than in flying or military life, and she definitely expressed an interest in me that made me uncomfortable on several levels. Davey just rolled his eyes at her a couple of times while we all chatted for about an hour. When I got home, I was surprised to see Trevor’s truck outside, and him waiting inside for me. “Trevor stopped by about an hour ago to see you.” Mom said by way of introduction as I came in and I looked at my friend with a little trepidation. Why was he here? “How about we go out back?” Trevor asked and I nodded in agreement before leading the way out into the back yard. He stood there, hands in his pockets and looked around for a bit before speaking. “You moved your weights out here.” “Yes, now what do you want?” I said sharply, more sharply than I intended and he winced slightly. “Dude, can’t I just come by and say hi to my friend?” Trevor asked defensively. “We’ve been friends forever, dude, and you gotta know I miss you.” “Yeah, well I figured you decided your girlfriend’s more important.” I said with a shrug. “Dude, don’t go there.” He said angrily. “What about your little boyfriend?” “He’s just my friend.” I said quickly. “According to Marcie she saw you guys together Friday night.” Trevor said with a leer and I felt my temper rise. “Yeah that was just before she started giving Mark Spencer a blow job in his car.” I sneered and he looked at me with wide eyes. “So that’s why he did it.” Trevor whispered. “Did what?” I asked, knowing what he probably meant. “He’s the one who slashed Jones’s tires for her.” Trevor said. “That’s why I came by here, to tell you that.” “Why?” I asked. “She was pissed when she saw you hanging out around him.” Trevor said softly. “Marcie thinks that if she can keep anyone from hanging out around you that you’ll beg her to take you back and so she’s sending a message to anyone who’d be your friend.” “Thanks, but that’s not what I meant.” I replied. “I already figured that part out, what I meant was why are you here telling me all this?” “We’ve been friends for years, Brian.” Trevor said softly, not meeting my eyes but looking out over the back yard. “I’m starting to think no girl’s worth destroying our friendship over.” “It’d have been nice for you to figure that out earlier.” I said angrily and instantly regretted those words. “I’m sorry, Trevor, that wasn’t fair. I’ve been as bad a friend over the past year from what it sounds like. You know, we use to have a better idea about what was important in life.” “Yeah, we did until we started really dating.” Trevor said with a sigh. “Is that what the future holds? We meet some girl, marry her and lose all of our old friends?” “It doesn’t have to be that way.” I said from the experience of actually having lived a life where I kept in touch with my old friends. We’d all been there, together, that day that the plane had slammed into the Pentagon despite Davey’s efforts, and we’d all been in the same room together when the last American troops left Iraq in 2007, and when war had broken out in 2009 following the assassination of the Iraqi Prime Minister, we’d all watched as Congress voted to send our troops back over there, and we’d all joined Trevor in celebrating his Super Bowl victory in 2011. “I don’t want it that way.” Trevor said after a long moment of quiet thinking. He turned back to look me in the eyes before holding out his hand. “Friends again?” “Always.” I said, taking his hand and shaking it firmly. “So how’s David doing with his car?” Trevor asked in a much easier tone and I relaxed as I told him how my father was fixing the car up. He shook his head, and we talked in earnest for several hours out there on the porch. It was a good beginning. Chapter 9 Monday morning I picked Davey up early, before anyone else in his grandmother’s house was even awake, and we ran around the track at the school. By the time we were done, the gym was opened and Coach Cole nodded at us as we came in for a shower. Davey was exhausted, but once again completing the run had left him in a good mood. We hit the cafeteria for breakfast, and I noticed him choosing much the same food that I did, staying away from the high cholesterol, greasy stuff that he might have normally eaten. Since he didn’t have to work that afternoon, he stayed around school while I went to baseball practice. I could see him sitting there on the bleachers, sneaking looks at the guys on the team in their practice gear, and smiled to myself since I was the recipient of most of those looks. Mark Spencer was spending most of the practice ignoring me until sliding practice where he tried to swipe my leg with his cleats. Coach Anders spotted his attempt and sent him running laps for the rest of practice with a threat that if he did it again, he’d be suspended from the team for a week. “Yo, Breckenridge, I hear that Jones guy over there is bobbing your knob now.” Adam Mitchell, another junior on the team who also played football said to me in a low voice as we stood near the dugout while the sliding drills continued. “If he was, it’d be better than that bitch Marcie.” I said forcefully and Mitchell burst out in laughter, nearly doubling over. “Yo, Jones, why don’t you do something useful instead of sitting there?” Coach Anders called out to Davey a few minutes later and Davey looked up with curiosity. “Get over here.” Davey complied, getting up and putting away the book he’d been reading. Anders gave him the clipboard he’d been making notes on and then had Davey following him around, scribing notes on the clipboard about the performance of different members of the team. That left a smile on my face, and I wondered again at how the staff at a school with over two thousand students still found time to do little things like Anders was doing. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, Spencer?” Anders’s voice boomed out near the end of practice and I looked up from where I’d just slid into second base before the tag to see Spencer caught red-handed rifling through Davey’s backpack. Davey had left it on the bleachers where he’d been sitting, and Spencer was halfway through tearing some pages out of the book Davey had been reading. Davey stood next to the coach with a look of anger on his face. “I…uh…” Spencer stammered but the Coach cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Get your stupid ass into my office and wait for me there.” Anders growled. “Everyone, twenty laps and practice is over. Jones, make sure they all complete their laps and then help Riley get the equipment put up before meeting me in my office. I want to talk to you too.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said weakly, glaring at Spencer. “Oh, and make sure nothing’s missing from your backpack and give me the details of anything Spencer damaged.” Anders ordered before walking away, following the path a sullen Mark Spencer was taking to the gym and the coach’s office. I gave Davey a sympathetic look that he shrugged off before joining the team to make the laps. “That was plain wrong.” Adam Mitchell said as he jogged near me. Trevor was further back in the bunch, and Brandon was lagging behind all of us when several people made a point of speeding up to keep from being beside him. It seemed the team knew damn well where the battle lines were being drawn between Marcie and I, and while people didn’t exactly flock around me, they knew Brandon was on ‘her’ side right now and were shunning him. The few times I glimpsed his face, it looked like he was deep in thought. “Which part?” I asked Adam after staying quiet for a moment. His statement could have gone both ways. “Spencer going through his backpack.” Adam said softly. “I heard your ex-girlfriend bragging at lunch about how Spencer slashed that Jones guy’s tires over the weekend and now this. She’s fucking wacko. Dude, you know I was just teasing you about the fag shit, right? I mean, no one really believes the shit she’s talking about. Most people know she’s pissed you dumped her ass for being a slut and she’s just trying to get back at you.” “Don’t worry about it, dude.” I said with a shrug. “So, Jones, he’s a pretty cool guy?” Adam asked a lap later. Trevor and a few other teammates were now running with us. “We knew him in junior high at La Loma.” Trevor answered before I could say anything. “He’s a bit geeky but not bad. He played on the freshman team before he moved to Nevada.” “I heard his dad’s a pervert.” Rich, another of our teammates said derisively. “It was in the papers how his old man was porkin’ Jones’s sister.” “Don’t even fucking joke about that shit.” Tim, another of our teammates said with a disgusted sound in his voice. “Imagine if that was your sister.” “I don’t have a sister.” Rich said defensively. “You do have a brother, don’t you?” Tim shot back. “Don’t fucking even suggest that shit.” Rich’s voice filled with anger. “Now imagine what it must be like for Jones.” I said softly, gathering everyone’s attention, and after another lap that passed by in silence, Rich spoke up again. “How does he stand it?” Rich asked quietly. “Do you think Jones will help Riley and Coach out for the season?” Tim asked me in the silence that followed Rich’s comment. “Probably not.” I said with a shake of my head. “He works a lot you know. I’m giving him a ride for now until his car’s fixed and he was only here today because he had the day off. His mom and sister need the money bad. His mom, she’s getting ready for a major surgery in a week or two, and his sister’s going to therapy that he has to pay for since no one else can.” “Dude, he pays for all that shit?” Rich asked with surprise. “Why don’t someone else pay, like his father or the state?” “Who’d hire his father after he was in the news so much?” I snorted. “His mother can’t work, at least until after the surgery because of her back and the state’s dicking her around on disability. Someone has to pay for that stuff, and so he works his ass off.” “Dude, that’s so unfair.” Tim said quietly. “Fuck, how’s he paying to fix his car with all those bills?” “Dad’s paying for it.” I said with a shrug. “He’s lucky to have you for a friend.” Trevor said with a hint of bitterness in his voice. I guessed the bitterness was for his having taken Marcie’s side of everything at first. “More like I’m lucky to have him for a friend.” I replied. “Why’s that?” Rich asked quietly. “He likes to play sports.” I said quietly. “At his last school he played football, basketball, track, just about every sport they offered, and he was on the debate team and a whole bunch of other stuff. The guy’s smart, and he’s had to give all that up so he can earn enough money to pay his sister’s psychologist’s bills. How many of us would give up everything we wanted to help our family out? That’s loyalty, and he gives the same loyalty to friends, too.” “Oh.” Rich said, and we finished the rest of our laps in relative silence. Davey was already inside the gym as I entered with the rest of the team. There was no sign of Mark Spencer, but Davey was in with Coach Anders while I got undressed and showered. By the time I was clean and dressed in my street clothes, there was another commotion and we all turned to see Coach Cole leading a red-faced Mark Spencer into the gym. He had Spencer’s right arm bent behind his back and had the angriest look on his face I’d ever seen before. “Breckenridge, get in the office now!” Cole roared and I jumped to obey, stuffing my dirty practice uniform into my bag before leaving the bag on the bench and double-timing to the office. “What’s he done now?” Coach Anders asked as I entered the office and shut the door behind me. The rest of the team was trying to hear what was going on without looking like it, but Cole crossed the room to close the blinds. He’d dumped Mark into one of the chairs where Mark was glowering at Davey and I in turn. Davey’s shoulders were hunched up, and he was looking at the floor. “I found him taking a key to Breckenridge’s car.” Cole growled angrily before looking at me. “Sorry, Breckenridge, you’ve got a couple of good scratches that are going to require the car to be repainted probably.” “You son of a bitch.” I growled, turning angrily to Spencer. “Watch your language, Breckenridge.” Coach Anders growled at me. “That’s five laps you owe me tomorrow before practice.” “Yes, coach.” I said, turning my anger down to a hard simmer. “Spencer, what part of me sending you to the Principal as punishment for what you’d already done didn’t you understand?” Coach Anders asked of Spencer who just shrugged his shoulders while staring at his hand. “Do you understand what has to happen now?” “Borsch already suspended me for two days and I have to pay that faggot back for the stupid book.” Spencer said sullenly. “You can count on another trip to Principal’s office for that.” Anders growled. “What, you give Breckenridge a couple of laps and send me to the Principal?” Spencer sneered. “That’s really fair.” “Breckenridge is on the team, you’re not.” Anders said sternly. “What?” Spencer’s voice almost cracked in his surprise. “Since when?” “Since Coach Cole found you keying Breckenridge’s car.” Anders retorted. “I won’t have a vandal on my team.” “That’s fucking great.” Spencer murmured, glaring daggers at Davey and then at me. “You’ll pay for this, both of you.” “Actually, it’s you who’ll pay.” Cole said angrily. “We’ll be calling the police here in a few minutes for them to come and take our statements and photograph the evidence of what you did. Breckenridge here is going to press charges, so there’ll be criminal charges, and you’ll have to pay for the damage you caused.” “Like fucking hell I will.” Spencer growled. “I’ll pay for slashing the fag’s tires before I’ll pay for Breckenridge’s car.” “What?” Anders growled with wide eyes as he sat up a bit straighter. Spencer realized he’d said too much, and kept his mouth shut. “What’s he talking about, Jones?” “The tires were slashed on my car over the weekend, Coach.” Davey explained in a voice that was tightly controlled. He was glaring at Spencer and flexing his hands like he wanted to hit the guy. “We were pretty sure it was him who did it, and a couple of people have told me they heard Marcie bragging about him doing it, but you know, that’s all hearsay. Now he’s admitted it front of me. Can you please call the cops? I want to file charges for that too.” “We all heard him, Jones.” Cole said sternly. “Brian, you think the shop that’s working on the car threw the tires out?” Davey asked. “We’ll find out.” I assured him and he nodded, and this time it was he who glared daggers at Spencer, who was now looking fairly pale. Most of the team had left by the time that the police finished, and while they weren’t sure if they could get charges to stick over Davey’s tires, they were quite certain they could get a conviction for the keying of my car, even though it was only a misdemeanor vandalism charge, and he’d likely get only a few hours of community service. The important part was that his father was called in by the police, as was my father. No one could reach Davey’s mother, who was in the Bay Area having tests done, but his grandfather showed up, ready to spit nails. The look of shock on Davey’s face as his grandfather took up Davey’s side and threatened Mr. Spencer with lawsuits and the ‘almighty judgment of the Lord God on your worthless son’ was a sight to see, and I think for the first time in a long time, Davey realized his grandfather really did care for him. “Davey, I’ll give you a ride home.” Pete said as we stood outside looking at my car. “Brian, I’m sorry this had to happen to your handsome car.” “I’m just glad we know who did it and he’ll be paying the price for what he did to not only my car but Davey’s car as well.” I said and Pete nodded. “Davey, this one here’s a good guy.” Pete said with a jerk of his thumb towards me. “You keep him close and we’ll see about changing some things around the house.” “Thanks, Mr. Barrow.” I said quietly and he snorted. “Call me Pete, son.” He said as he held out his hand and I shook it firmly. “Now, let’s get a move on, Davey. Mr. Breckenridge, you’ve got a fine son there, and I appreciate all the help you’ve given my grandson. As soon as his car’s fixed, you bring me the bill.” “Thank you.” Dad said with a nod, although the look in his eyes said Pete would be a long time waiting for that bill. “Brian, you want to get your car to a shop and see about an estimate?” “Let’s wait for Davey’s car to get fixed.” I suggested and Dad nodded. “I’ve got to get back to work.” Dad said. “I’ll see you at dinner?” “Yep.” I said and smiled at him as thanks for his support and help. Finding Trevor waiting for me on the front porch of the house wasn’t a surprise, but Brandon being there with him was a surprise. Mom wasn’t home yet, so they’d waited on the porch for me. When they saw me approach, they both stood up, although Brandon had his hands in his pants pockets and didn’t really meet my gaze. “Hey guys.” I said as lightly as I could and Trevor smiled half-heartedly while Brandon scuffed a foot on the sidewalk. I unlocked the door and they followed me into the house were we stood in the living room. “You want something to drink?” “I’m sorry.” Brandon said softly as an answer, and he lifted his head up to meet my eyes, ready to flinch but he didn’t see any anger there. He took a deep breath as he met my gaze and continued. “I haven’t been a good friend. Marcie’s crazy, and she got our girlfriends to give us ultimatums. I should have known better than to cave to her.” “I forgive you.” I said immediately and held out my hand. He sighed with relief and took it quickly. “So does this mean we’re all three single again?” “Yeah.” Trevor said with a grin. “I got a call as soon as I got home demanding to know what I was going to do to help Marcie and Mark get back at you and Davey and I told her it was over.” “I did too.” Brandon said softly. “Dude, there’s something you need to know, too.” “What’s that?” I asked as a little knot of worry filled my gut. “Marcie, she had me follow you and Davey the other day.” Brandon said with a guilty look on his face. “She knows he doesn’t live in the district and she’s thinking of going to Principal Borsch and getting Davey in trouble. That’s what they wanted me to do, go with them and tell him I’ve seen where Davey really lives. She thinks that’ll get him kicked out of school. She had Mark check earlier today. He’s got a friend who works in the attendance office and he got in Davey’s record and figured out that the address on Davey’s record isn’t where he lives.” “You’re serious.” I said with a frown. Marcie had ammunition now, and if she used it, there wasn’t much we could do about that, not without some help at least. “Yeah, I’m sorry I helped her out.” Brandon said. “Tell that to Davey.” I snapped and he winced. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have snapped like that.” “I deserve it.” Brandon said. “What happened with Spencer? I saw what he did to your car, and so did most of the team. A couple of the guys were wanting to hunt him down and beat the shit out of him.” “He’s being taken care of.” I said with a smile, and related the afternoon’s events to them, or at least what they didn’t already know. “Whew, he’s going to be in a world of shit.” Trevor said with a chuckle. “His father ain’t exactly the most understanding of guys.” “You can say that again.” Brandon laughed. “So, tell us the truth, you and Davey?” “We’re good friends, almost as good friends as I was with the two of you.” I said pointedly and they both nodded slowly. “You mean as good friends as we are again.” Trevor countered. “We’ll see.” I replied and they both nodded with acceptance of that. “So, you two are going to look for new girlfriends?” I asked and Brandon shook his head. “You know, I think I’ll stay single for a bit.” Brandon said with a shrug. “I will too, besides there’s always the barn.” Trevor said with a wink towards Brandon who blushed a bit before smiling. I turned away, not really ready to deal with this yet from my friends. How could they flip-flop so easily between denying they ever did anything with guys and then be this open? “Brian, you want to join us?” “Um, no thanks.” I said with a blush and they laughed. “Well, we’ll like see you tomorrow at school, right?” Brandon asked, and I realized they were really going to be going to Trevor’s barn right now! Jesus they were… teenagers. “Yeah, see you guys at school.” I assured them and then I winked. “Don’t have too much fun in that barn.” “We will.” Trevor said before leading the way out. The phone rang before the door had even finished shutting behind them and I went to answer it before the machine picked up the call. The fact that it was a crank call with heavy breathing and threats on the other end didn’t surprise me. The way they hung up when I mentioned that the police were monitoring all calls to the house in light of recent events ended the call rather quickly. There was homework to do, and a list of chores from my mother that kept me busy for most of the afternoon. I even put my practice uniform in the wash and it was almost dry by the time she got home. Apparently she’d already heard about my day from Dad, and wanted to hear more details, which I gave to her as she started dinner. Davey’s upcoming problem with his residence was in the back of my mind, and the obvious solution was something I wanted to approach carefully, so I didn’t tell her about that yet. Over dinner, Dad had more to say about the day’s events, and he informed me that he’d hired an attorney to represent me and Davey both in a civil suit against Spencer’s and Marcie’s parents. He never really expected to see any money out of them, but he wanted the suit on record, because it would be a permanent record against not only their parents but against Marcie and Spencer. “Dad, there’s another problem you should know about as well.” I said calmly after dinner was over and Dad had finished his dialogue about how Marcie and Spencer were being dealt with. “What is it?” Dad asked just as calmly. “Brandon and Trevor came over after I got back today.” I said and Mom smiled. “You guys have made up?” She asked. “Yes.” I answered and she smiled broadly. “I told you it was just a matter of time.” She reminded me. “You were right, but Brandon had some disturbing news.” I continued. “Dad, you see, we know Davey doesn’t live in the district for Downey, but he also didn’t receive a legitimate transfer. A friend of his mother’s who does live in the district has been letting them use her address on Davey’s record.” “Marcie somehow figured this out?” Dad asked. “Yeah, she had Brandon follow us over the weekend.” I said. “So she’s reported it to the District?” Mom asked and I nodded. “If they investigate they’ll figure it out and send Davey back to Ceres.” Dad said shortly. “You know, that is where he should be going to school if he lives there.” “He’s miserable there, dad.” I responded. “He was fairly miserable at Downey too.” Dad replied. “Was being the key word there.” I pointed out and he nodded. “What do you expect me to do about this?” Dad asked me point-blank. “Expect?” I said. “I don’t expect anything, but I was hoping we might be able to help Davey come up with some alternatives to having to switch schools just when things are starting to look up for him here.” “You mean besides the crap Marcie’s pulling?” Mom said scornfully. “I hate to say it, but I don’t know what you ever saw in that girl.” Dad snorted. “I don’t either.” I replied in complete honesty. “Well I think the first thing we should do is call Pete and Davey and maybe get together with them to discuss this.” Dad said. “I agree.” Mom said and I nodded. He got up to leave the room and as soon as he was gone, Mom turned to me. “Brian, have you thought about dating again?” “Nope.” I snorted. “After Marcie, it’s far too early to think about stuff like that.” “Good.” Mom said with a nod of her head that surprised me. “Brian, Pete’s asked us to come by their place.” Dad said as he came back into the room. He was frowning and I got worried. “Davey’s mom was hospitalized by the doctors in San Francisco today. They just found out a little bit ago.” “Oh no.” Mom murmured, and she got up to go get her jacket. “I’m coming as well.” “I’ll get my jacket.” I said as it had gotten chilly outside as soon as the sun had set. The weather reports also called for a light rain tonight. The house was in near-pandemonium when we arrived. Two of Davey’s aunts, Fran and Priscilla were there, as was Davey and his sister, Jenny. Both of them looked really worried, and had food left over on their plates while almost everyone else had finished their food. His cousin Shantill was there, while her mother Fran held Shantill’s daughter in her arms, trying to calm the crying baby. Pete was sitting at the head of the table with a scowl on his face, and he nodded to my father as we entered, and smiled at my mother when Dad introduced her. “Let’s go in the living room.” He said, leading us through the doorway that connected the dining room with the living room. It was paneled in a dark wood, and had an old stereo console that ran the full length of one of the walls. We all sat down in the room, with Pete in one armchair, Davey in another while I sat on the couch with my parents. Pete shut the folding door across the kitchen for more privacy while Fran and Priscilla kept everyone else occupied. When we were all seated, and Priscilla had brought in some glasses of water for us, he spoke again. “I appreciate you folks coming down here like this. Davey’s made some good friends in you and I hate to impose on you any more.” “We’re honored to have Davey as a friend of our son’s.” Dad said. “He’s a fine young man.” “He can be when he puts his mind to the job.” Pete said with a sideways look at Davey who was looking withdrawn. “Monta’s in a fit right now what with Sandy being hospitalized so sudden like.” “Do we know what’s wrong yet?” Dad asked. “All they said was complications from her back.” Pete said sourly. “That girl’s had to deal with too much in her life as it is without this. There’s nothing we can do about that now but pray. Monta said you had a place you were willing to rent to her?” “She insisted on paying rent.” Dad said firmly. “As far as we’re concerned, she’s free to use it anytime without charge.” “We’ll pay for what we use.” Pete said just as firmly. “We do appreciate the use of the place, though. I’m heading up there in a bit to help Monta out. That woman will spend so much time in a tizzy over Sandy that she won’t take care of herself and both of them will end up in the hospital.” “I’ve brought the keys and directions on how to get there from Children’s Hospital.” Dad said, pulling a folded piece of paper and a set of keys from his pocket. He gave them to me and I got up and handed them to Pete. “It’s much appreciated.” Pete said and then he looked over at Davey for a long moment. “Thanks for all the help you’ve been giving me and my family.” Davey said in a way that suggested he’d been told exactly what to say. Despite that, his eyes showed that the sentiment was real. “We’re glad to be of help.” Mom said immediately. “It’s the right thing to do, and I knew if we needed help like this, you and your family wouldn’t hesitate to return the favor.” “I don’t want to have to ask this, but I do have another favor to ask.” Pete said at that point. “Fran and Priscilla will take turns watching out for Shantill and Whitney, and the mother of one of Jenny’s friends has offered to take her in for a week or two until I get back in town. Monta won’t leave that city until Sandy comes home, but there’s no need for me to stay the full time up there. That leaves Davey, and honestly I’d rather he stay with someone else than stay here on his own. Fran could take him in, but she’s going to have enough on her plate without adding Davey to it, and I don’t like that oldest boy of hers. He’ll just draw Davey into more trouble.” “Papa.” Davey started to protest, but quieted at the look on his grandfather’s face. Mom and Dad looked at each other and then at me for a moment before they nodded at each other. “Pete, we’d appreciate it if you’d let Davey stay with us until things settle down here at home.” Dad said. “He and Brian get along well, and he’s proved to be helpful around the house. We’d be honored if you thought it was good for him to stay with us.” “I can help out with his room and board.” Pete said gruffly. “We had a talk tonight and he’s going to quit his job tomorrow. There’s just too damn much stuff going on with this family for him to waste his time working away. He’s already proved he would if he had too, and that’s good enough for me. I’ve told him tonight that as long as he’s getting good grades in school, and doing extra-curricular work, I will pay his car payments, insurance, and cover Jenny’s bills. The coach of the baseball team offered to pay him twenty bucks a week if he worked as an equipment manager for the team, so he’ll have some spending money at least.” “We won’t take a dime, Pete.” Dad said firmly. “He’ll do chores around the house just like Brian and that’ll cover his room and board.” “You sure about that?” Pete asked. “You’ll give him real chores to do?” “Yes.” Dad said firmly, and my stomach did a little flip-flop. Davey was going to be staying at my house full-time now. It made me excited, but at the same time nervous. “Then I’ll not push that.” Pete said sternly. “Mind you, it’s just for a few weeks until we get things settled with Sandy.” “It won’t be a problem even if it goes a bit longer.” Dad said confidently and Mom nodded her agreement. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” Pete said stolidly. “Davey, why don’t you and Brian go pack your stuff for a week, and remember what I told you.” “Yes, sir.” Davey said as he stood up. I stood as well, and followed him into the house entryway and through the kitchen where he was all but tackled by his blond sister. “I can’t believe this is happening.” Jenny cried into his shoulder while their aunts looked on. Shantill was on the phone again, laughing at whatever she was hearing from the person on the other side of the line. It seemed almost cruel for her to be laughing while her cousins were going through a bad time. “It’ll be okay, sis.” Davey said softly, rubbing a hand through her long, blond hair. “I don’t want you to go.” She whined and I felt sorry for her, and felt a bit selfish that I was so happy Davey would be staying with us. “It’s only for a week or two, and my car will be fixed by the weekend, so we can go see her then.” Davey said. “You promise?” She asked hopefully. “What about your work?” “Papa says I don’t have to work anymore.” Davey said with a hint of disbelief in his voice. That brought a smile to my face, because it was something the Pete Barrow I remembered would have done for his grandson. “Really?” Jenny asked. “What about my appointments?” “He’ll take care of them.” Davey said with even more disbelief showing in his voice. “You’ve got Brian’s number, right?” “Yes.” She said. “You’ve got the number to Stacey’s house, right?” “Yep.” Davey agreed with a smile. “I’ll call you every night, okay?” “Okay.” She said and wiped her nose with the back of her hand like I’d seen Davey do over the weekend. It was a cute family trait, one I’d noticed several times before in the other timeline. “Good, now I’ve got to go pack and you should too.” He told her gently. “Stacey’s mom will be here soon.” “Yeah.” She said with a smile and went down the hallway to the bedroom she shared with her mother. I followed Davey down into the family room where he pulled out a suitcase, a duffel bag, and his school backpack before putting clothes in them. “I really appreciate this.” He said to me as I stood and watched him. Part of me wanted to help, but I sensed this was something he wanted to do himself. “You know it’s not a problem.” I told him and he nodded his head while he finished loading his suitcase and bags. When he’d finished, he looked wistfully at his stereo. “You going to bring your stereo?” “You don’t think it’d be a problem?” He asked. “I mean it’s only for a week or two.” “Dude, if you want to bring it, bring it.” I encouraged him and he smiled before moving to disconnect all the wires. It took only one trip for the both of us to load up the trunk of Mom’s car with his stuff, and when we shut the trunk, we turned to find my parents standing there with his grandfather on the sidewalk. “Thank you for everything, Papa.” Davey said and the old man nodded gruffly before pulling Davey into a very quick hug. That was a loud statement of affection from the man who usually only gave handshakes unless it was to a pretty girl. “You just do what we talked about.” Pete said sternly and Davey nodded his agreement. “Let’s get going so we can get you settled in, Davey.” Dad said kindly and turned to shake Pete’s hand before we got into the car. I could see Pete’s smile when Mom hugged him before joining us in the car. It was a slight surprise, but a welcome one when Davey’s hand reached across the back seat to find mine in a tight grip as Dad drove us home. Chapter 10 Hearing a description of something and seeing it unfold in front of you are two totally different things, and no matter how good the description is, sometimes it can’t just relate the full majesty, or horror of an event. I had stood on a slight hill and watched an airliner slam into the Pentagon in a different timeline, but the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger brought tears to my eyes much the same as the events of 9/11 had in that other time. Like most of the other kids in our school, I watched the televisions that had been placed around the school to show the destruction of NASA’s premier vehicle, and the death of seven astronauts. “My god.” Davey whispered in horror from next to me as we watched the event happen in slow motion while a news channel played it over and over again. There was the sound of a few girls weeping in the library, but most of the kids watched it over and over again in stunned silence as commentators explored those final moments over and over again, and threw out theories on what could have gone wrong. “It was the o-rings on the booster, you stupid idiot.” I murmured to the commentator, remembering another of Davey’s explanations, and realized I should have kept my mouth shut when this Davey looked at me with surprise. “What makes you say that?” He asked me. “Just a hunch.” I temporized. “David Jones, please report to the Principal’s office.” A voice said over the loudspeaker, causing a few students to jerk in surprise, and several turned to Davey who looked confused. “I wonder what I’ve done now.” Davey said softly before walking off, leaving me there to chew on my lip nervously. Could Marcie’s little ploy about where he lived have already born fruit or was this fallout from yesterday? Either way, I knew dad needed to know and I found the nearest pay phone to call him at work. “Go to the Principal’s office and wait for me there.” Dad ordered me as soon as I’d told him. “If it’s about yesterday they’ll probably call you, if it’s about his residence, well I think I’ve got what we need to fix that problem.” “Okay.” I said with as much enthusiasm as I could muster and went to the office. The student on duty there, a friend of Marcie’s, gave me a glare but said nothing as I sat down. “Can I help you son?” The older secretary said after she realized the girl wasn’t going to address me. “I’m just waiting for Davey to get done in there.” I said with a nod towards the Principal’s office. “Oh, dear, he’s going to be a while.” She said with a shake of her head. “We need to get his parents in here and we can’t seem to get a hold of his mother at all.” “That’s probably because she’s been hospitalized in San Francisco.” I said quickly and she gave me a questioning look. “You’re a friend of his?” She asked, and I looked at Marcie’s friend with a significant glance and she got my drift. “Why don’t you come back here and tell me how I can get in touch with his parents.” I nodded and got another glare from the girl before sitting down at the woman’s desk. If we talked in low tones, the girl wouldn’t hear what we said. The older secretary smiled at me as I sat. “Now, you say his mother is in the hospital?” “Yes, Children’s Hospital in San Francisco.” I said. “His grandparents are up there too. She was hospitalized yesterday.” “What about his father?” She asked with a frown and then her frown deepened as her eyes widened. “Now that was a stupid question, of course he’s not someone we can call about this. Where is David staying? Certainly they didn’t leave him alone to fend for himself.” “No, he’s staying at my house.” I told her. “I’ve already called my father and he’s on his way in here.” “Oh, that’s a good thing dear.” She said with a genuine smile. “Tell me, how long has he been…” “Brian!” Dad’s voice called out, interrupting her and I looked over to see my father dressed in his business suit and staring down the girl who looked like she’d tried to misdirect him or something. “Ah, you must be Mr. Breckenridge.” The secretary said as she stood up. As much as I couldn’t really remember her name, she apparently knew me just fine. She walked over to the counter and smiled at my dad. “Your son was just helping me figure out how to get in touch with a responsible adult for Mr. Jones.” “Yes, well that would be me.” Dad said with authority filling his voice. He handed over a piece of paper that I could see had been notarized. “This is of course a fax copy, but you’ll see that Sandy Jones, mother of one David Jones, Jr., has granted temporary guardianship of David Jones Jr. to my wife and me. As he’ll be staying with us for an indefinite period of time depending on the outcome of her surgery, I had planned to file this with the school. Now, I’d like to know why my ward has been called into the office of the Principal.” “This appears to be in order, although a certified copy should be filed as soon as you have one.” The secretary said as she looked over the document. “How long do you think this arrangement will last? When is Mrs. Jones expected to be back home?” “It’ll be at least a month, if not longer.” Dad said quickly. “My wife and I have told her to worry about getting her strength back fully before worrying about David. As far as we’re concerned, he’ll be living at our home at least through the end of the semester.” “I see.” She said with a wide smile that told both my father and I that she was quite aware of what he was doing. “I take it you do know why Mr. Jones was called into the office and why we’re trying to get in touch with his family?” “I’m not sure I understand what you mean.” Father said ingenuously and she smiled even more. “Well, why don’t you follow me and I’ll introduce you to the Principal.” She said. “I’ve met him before.” Dad said. “Yes, that’s right.” She smiled. “Brian, why don’t you have a seat? Davey should be out shortly.” I went and sat down, and within a couple of minutes Davey shuffled out of the office while my father stayed behind, talking to Principal Borsch. Davey’s shoulders were slumped and he barely looked up as he slouched in his seat next to me. The bitch behind the counter smirked at him until she saw my glare. “How did they find out?” Davey murmured softly. “They’re going to ship me back to Ceres unless Mr. B can do something.” “I wouldn’t worry too much about that.” I said confidently “As for how they found out, I give you one guess.” “You know, sometimes I wonder if being your friend is a curse or blessing.” Davey muttered, but the corners of his lips quirked and I knew he was joking, or at least mostly joking. “She’ll pay for this.” I said firmly and he started to laugh softly. “She already has.” Davey said insightfully. “She’s doing this to try and win you back, but all she’s doing is guaranteeing you’ll never give her the time of day again. As long as I can still go to school here, that’s fine with me.” “We’ll make sure that happens.” I said, and since we’d really had no chance to talk about last night, I decided to ask him another question. “What was up with your grandfather last night? Why’s he making you quit?” “I don’t think you heard him and Coach Cole talking yesterday.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Papa won’t say what Cole said to him, but when we got home he asked me some real tough questions. I can’t believe it, but I told him the truth, even when he asked me about drinking and drugs. That’s when he told me I had to quit my job. He told me I’d proven I’d work to support a family but that I should have time to be a kid instead of having to grow up just because my old man was a loser. That hurt, but I don’t think he meant to insult me that time. He asked me what I did in school back in Nevada instead of drinking and doing drugs, and when I told him about being in sports and other stuff, he told me that was what he wanted me to do. Coach Cole told him they wanted me to help with the baseball team, doing equipment manager stuff with Riley and helping the coaches. Then he wants me to try out for football in the fall.” “That’ll be good.” I said with a smile as a happy feeling washed over me. This was what Davey’s high school life was supposed to be like. “Yeah, and I have to go fishing and camping with him over the summer.” Davey said with a snort. “We never caught a fish when I was a kid and went with him.” “It’s not catching the fish that’s the point.” I told Davey. “It’s going and being in the company of the other person, even if you never say anything.” “You sound like you’ve gone fishing with him.” Davey snorted. “Maybe I have, in a weird kind of way.” I said and he gave me an odd look before shrugging. “Well, anyway, I don’t rightly like giving up work.” Davey said with a sigh. “Janice says I have a chance at making Assistant Manager when I turn eighteen next year and that’s good money.” “College gets you better money.” I said. “If you can afford it.” Davey snorted. “There are always scholarships.” I reminded him. “If you’re willing to take hand-outs.” He said derisively. “They’re not hand-outs, you have to earn them.” I pointed out and he gave me a weird look. “Look, you can’t get a scholarship with bad grades, or for any number of reasons. You have to earn them, it’s just usually academic or other work around school or the community that helps you earn them. They aren’t handouts.” “That’s what you think.” Davey said sourly, but he was at least thinking about what I said, I was sure, as Dad came out of the Principal’s office. He turned to shake the man’s hand one more time before walking around the counter and stopping in front of us. “David, Brian, why don’t you walk me to the car.” He said and we stood up to follow him out. Once we were out of the building he let out a sigh. “Davey, I don’t like lying. It almost always comes back and bites you in the ass, but I’ve skirted the line today for you. Pete got your mom to sign a Limited Guardianship for you. It names me as your temporary Guardian until your mother rescinds it after she’s recovered. What that means is that I’m legally obligated to care for you as if you were my son until she says otherwise.” “Thank you, Mr. B.” Davey said in a barely audible voice. His shoulders were slumped again and Dad looked sharply at him. “What that means, Davey, is what we talked about a little last night after we got back to the house.” Dad continued. “I expect you to obey the rules we set out for you, to tell us if something is wrong or you need help, to let us know where you are and not to make any long trips without getting our approval first, and that does include going to see your mother, but I also promise we will make sure you have time and gas to go see her as much as possible. The only real difference this document makes is that now it’s a legal relationship. Don’t think it means your mother isn’t still your mother. As soon as she’s better all she has to do is say she’s rescinding the guardianship and it’s gone. What it does mean, and what’s especially important given the fact that the school now knows you really did not live in the district, is that your legal residence is now our house, inside the Downey District, until and unless your mother rescinds the guardianship.” “You mean… you mean I won’t be forced to go to Ceres?” Davey said with a sigh of relief. “That’s what it means for now.” Dad said with a smile. “Now, more than likely it’ll last just fine for the rest of this semester, but next year you’ll either have to be still living with us or your mother will have to live in the district. “That’s fine, at least for now it’s not a threat.” Davey said happily, and he hugged my father quickly. “Thanks, Mr. B.” “I’m glad I thought of it in time.” Dad said before getting into his car. “I’ll see you boys at dinner.” “Bye, dad.” I said before he pulled off, and Davey was grinning at me. “So does this mean we’re temporary brothers?” Davey asked with a giggle and I felt a moment of horror. Did that mean he and I getting together would be incest? No, and if it did, who cares? “Just be careful, Davey.” I warned him and he frowned. “You know what they say about brothers and incest being best.” “Ewe, gross.” He said, mock-gagging with a finger down his throat. We both laughed as we went back into the school. Practice that afternoon was cancelled, although Davey spent a few minutes talking to the coaches about baseball practice. He worked out a deal with them that let him give two weeks notice at work, and when we stopped by the restaurant where he worked primarily, his manager Janice seemed downright happy that he was quitting instead of upset like he expected. They worked out a deal where he’d have time to work at practice before going to work there for three days this week and two days next week. He tried to offer to work more, but she flat out refused saying they had just hired four more people that week. We’d been home for only a few minutes before Trevor called to say a bunch of guys from the team were meeting up at a nearby field to throw a few balls. It took a little work, but I got Davey to go with me and we went to the field wearing sweats. It almost turned into a disaster. I’d not realized that Davey had almost never played catch in this timeline, when in the last he’d been amazing at baseball. For a worried moment after he dropped the ball for the tenth time, I worried the guys were going to start teasing him, but to my surprise Adam took him to the side while the rest of us continued to toss the ball back and forth. Up until dinner time, Adam worked with him until he was catching just about every other toss that Adam threw him, and doing a decent job tossing the ball back. It wasn’t anywhere good enough to make the team, but it was better than he’d been at the start, and he had a smile on his face as we went home for dinner. That night he talked to one of his aunts on the phone after dinner. The doctors had moved up his mother’s surgery to the end of the week. He’d be able to see her on Saturday, when she should be out of surgery and doing fine. His next call was to his sister, who he talked to for about an hour before making a third call to Todd. I’d barely talked to the red-head in the last week, we’d nodded to each other every time we passed in the hallways. By the time he was off the phone, it was almost bedtime, and he worked furiously at the rest of his homework before going into ‘his’ room and going to sleep. Things were finally starting to come together for both of us, and I slept peacefully that night. Mark Spencer came back to school on Friday, and spent every minute he could staring at us. It made Davey uncomfortable, but we tried to ignore him. Certainly Brandon and Trevor’s presence was helpful to me, although Davey was still a little uncertain around them. I was thinking he was uncomfortable with them on several levels, not just because he’d been intimate with them before, or because they’d at first sided with Marcie, but more a combination of those things. On Friday afternoon, we went to pick up his car. I drove us there, and Dad met us there, a smile on his face as he waited for Davey to see his car. Davey gasped at the first site of the car with its front end repaired, and the car sported a fresh paint job of a dark blue. “You…you shouldn’t have done all this.” Davey said with tears in his eyes while Dad handed him his keys back. “I’ll never be able to repay all this.” “Just don’t scratch the new paint job when you take your sister to see your mother tomorrow.” Dad said with a smile as he lifted the hood to show him the engine. A lot of work had been done there, too, I knew. Dad had spent fifteen hundred dollars on the car, almost as much as Davey’s grandfather had paid to finish the payments due on the car. “Thank you.” Davey said, giving my father another hug. Dad smiled and returned it while Davey turned to me. “C’mon, Brian, let’s go for a drive.” “Don’t forget, you’ll need to give Brian a ride next week while they work on his car.” Dad told Davey who nodded enthusiastically while getting into his car. His excitement was catching and I got into the passenger seat next to him. “Will do.” Davey told dad before starting up the car and listening to it purr a bit before backing out into the parking lot. “Where you want to go?” “How about a milkshake?” I asked and he laughed. “I thought I was supposed to get rid of my stomach, not make it bigger.” He joked. He was starting to lose weight already. “A little cheating won’t hurt at this point.” I suggested and he nodded. Our choice of Denny’s proved to be disastrous. Unfortunately we didn’t realize that until after we’d sat down and ordered. Marcie came in, draped over Spencer’s arms, along with a gaggle of girls and other guys. “Oh dear, maybe we don’t want to eat here.” Marcie said in a sneer. “We might catch who knows what from those two fags over there.” “Let’s just go.” Mark Spencer said with a glare at us. “They might tell their folks we’re picking on them again and try to get us arrested.” “I think you need to leave.” The shift manager said as he walked up to them and Marcie glared at him before tossing her hair and walking out. The shift manager, a thin man in his early thirties looked over at us but didn’t say anything. We were just finishing up when a woman who’d just paid her bill came rushing back inside. “Does someone have a really dark blue Pontiac parked in the lot?” She asked just as we were getting out of the booth. Davey looked sick suddenly and I felt an urge to start swearing. “It’s mine.” Davey said and she came over towards us. “What’s wrong?” “I’m sorry young man, but a car just drove through the lot and a bunch of kids threw eggs at it.” She said in a huff. “They almost hit my car! What’d you do to get them mad at you?” “I exist.” Davey said miserably and looked at me for a nod before rushing outside. I paid the bill and went to join him in looking at the car. Anger warred with tears on his face as he looked at the car and my heart went out to him. “There’s a car wash just down the street.” I said. “I’ll pay.” “No, you and your family have done enough.” Davey said angrily. “They’re going to fucking pay for this.” “Let it go, Davey.” I urged him gently. “They’re not worth this.” “I don’t fucking deserve this!” He grated angrily. “They’re going to learn to not fuck with me!” “Don’t do something stupid.” I said sharply and he glared at me before taking a deep breath. “Why not?” He asked in a slightly calmer voice. “You really think they’re going to get in trouble for this?” “Spencer’s already off the team, and there was another guy on the team with him when they came into the restaurant.” I reminded Davey. “We can make them pay, but let’s do it the smart way, okay?’ “How’s that?” Davey asked and smirked. “Let’s just think about it for a while and make some plans, okay?” I suggested and he nodded sullenly. “For now, let’s hit the car wash before that egg stains the new paint.” “Okay.” Davey agreed reluctantly. That Saturday he returned from seeing his mother with a worried expression, but he also seemed relieved the first surgery was over. She’d be in the hospital for another three weeks before they did the next one to finish the work, and then she’d be there for another six weeks. It was longer than they’d expected, but the doctors said it would be better this way. Pete came back the next day, but there wasn’t even a hint that Davey should move back there. Dad had told Pete about the fact that Downey had almost sent Davey back to Ceres, and Pete didn’t want that to happen any more than Davey did. He knew damn well that Davey had gotten mixed in with a bad crowd there and didn’t want it to happen again. Twice over the next two weeks Davey or I came back out into the parking lot after school and found our cars had been defaced. Fortunately the damage wasn’t permanent or didn’t require more than a bit of touch-up, but Dad went into the Principal’s office with us following behind him and read the Principal the riot act. Borsch was a good man, and when he found out what was going on he took action. Unfortunately, no one was willing to come forward and admit they’d seen what had happened, but on the Tuesday after the President’s day holiday, two security guards caught Mark Spencer and a friend of his attempting to splatter pink paint over my Mustang. That was really bad news for Mark, who was supposed to go to court the next day on the original charges of vandalizing my car. It was also a reason for Principal Borsch to suspend him for a full week this time, and to tell him one more time and he’d be expelled from school. The other kid, a sophomore, got a three-day suspension. Marcie got caught up in it this time, because the police were able to track down a statement by Mark and prove that she’d bought the paint for them. That meant she was now going to face charges of her own. With him facing new charges, Mark begged for a deal from the DA and they rolled both charges together and he got six months probation along with two hundred hours of community service. Davey’s desire for revenge wasn’t exactly fulfilled, but he let it go after we’d learned of Mark’s punishment. The next day, it was all over school that he’d dumped Marcie, who immediately tried to replace him with a guy from the football team, but he told her to get real. For the next two weeks, she got more and more frustrated as guy after guy turned her down. By the time March came around, she was extremely upset that almost all her friends had deserted her. Our baseball season got off to a slow start, but by the first week of March we were on our way to a decent season. If we played our cards right, we might make the division playoffs. With Davey on the team in the last timeline, we’d clinched the playoffs early on, but this time Davey stayed in the dugout helping make sure we had plenty of Gatorade, or making sure everyone’s favorite bat was ready, or keeping the stats for the coaches who preferred to just watch the action than actually write things down. As the days and weeks flew by, I realized that I really did love this Davey Jones on his own terms, and not just because of the man I’d spent my life with in the last timeline. This Davey was a lot rougher around the edges, but he had the same quick wit, the same sense of humor, and the low but urgent drive to prove himself in anything he did. My original Davey had tried to say he didn’t have to prove himself to the world, but the truth was he’d constantly worked to prove himself even if he didn’t realize what he was doing. Dad left his job at the bank in mid-February and started with his new firm. At night he’d sit in the dining room and cuss as he tried to type up his handwritten notes. After the first two nights, Davey had quietly gotten up and offered to help him, taking over the typewriter. His fingers flew over the keys, and Dad’s memos came out letter-perfect. Davey was officially hired to help dad out for two hours per night, and a few hours on the weekend at a rate of pay that bordered on scandalous, although it really was the same rate that they were paying a clerk in the Bay Area. Davey had tried refusing money for an ‘allowance’, but he couldn’t refuse the offer of pay when Dad insisted this time. Two or three times a week he’d go to his grandparent’s house and have dinner with his grandfather, his sister, and whatever other family was there. I went with him a couple of times, but he went alone mostly. Trevor and Brandon came by more, working out with us a few times and other times just hanging around. Mom had taken Davey on two shopping trips, and although he tried to stop her from buying him clothes, and stuff for ‘his’ bedroom, she walked all over him and got her way. Things were going so smoothly right up until Darlene, who was in a class with both of us, asked Davey out on a date. For a moment, I thought he was going to accept, but he declined her offer politely, claiming that while his mother was in the hospital he didn’t want to start dating because he couldn’t give a girl the attention she deserved. Oh yes, he could be smooth when he wanted. As his mother went through her second surgery, and struggled to recover from what was obviously a painful ordeal, Davey came into my room late at night, and crawled wordlessly into my bed. He wanted, no needed, a shoulder to cry on, and as I’d told him I would be, I was there for him, letting him pour out his grief and holding him tightly. We woke the next morning, spooned together, and my body ached for more than the emotional closeness we were experiencing, but I kept that desire under control. I wasn’t blind to the looks he gave me from time to time, the looks of desire when he thought I didn’t see him. It wasn’t something he showed any inclination to talk about though, and the few times I tried to bring up the topic of gay people, he shut down completely. In mid-March, we had a game against a team from Hughson at their field, and we rode with the team on a bus down to the small town just south of Modesto. We won the game easily, and there was a lot of celebration on the bus ride back. Davey sat next to me near the middle of the bus, we talked all the way back to the school where most of the team went into the locker room to change. Not Davey and I though, because we joined Trevor and Brandon in heading to Trevor’s house where his parents were gone for the weekend. Brandon, Trevor and I were still wearing our game uniforms, dark blue shirts with gray pants and blue stirrups while Davey wore his team shirt and a pair of jeans. The rest of the team was changing into their clothes and going to dinner, but we’d basically snuck out so we could celebrate with a bottle of champagne that Trevor had procured and hidden in the loft of his barn. A little voice in my head was warning me that something might happen, given the looks Brandon and Trevor had been sharing most of the bus ride back to Modesto, and the looks Davey had been sending my way, and with plenty of alcohol and no dinner, that little voice was a shout that I tried not to listen to right then. “Dude, you so have to play football next year.” Trevor was saying to Davey when we’d finished most of the bottle. Davey and I were leaning against the rough wood of the barn wall, our legs splayed out in front of us, and his right leg was almost touching my left. The buzz of the champagne filled my head and I put my arm around his shoulders. He leaned into me with a sigh, and his hand landed on my leg, which he squeezed through the uniform pants I was wearing. My shoes had long since been kicked off, as had everyone else’s. Across from Davey and I, Brandon and Trevor were leaning against a hay bail and each other in poses similar to us. Brandon noticed Davey’s hand and smiled as Trevor finished the champagne and threw the empty bottle between us. “I’m not that good.” Davey demurred. “You have to at least try.” Brandon asserted with a slight slur. “We’ll help you practice over the summer, won’t we Brian?” “Yeah, we will.” I agreed and looked sideways at Davey. Most of the stomach he’d had was gone now, thanks to our regular running and workout on the weights at home, as well as P.E. “Okay, I think it’s time for true confessions.” Trevor murmured a few moments later. “What’s that?” Davey asked, trying to sit up straighter, and pushing down on my leg as he struggled to brace himself. I was getting hard at the contact with him, and my pants were tenting up a bit in front. “It’s time we all lay our deepest secrets to bare.” Trevor giggled and leaned into Brandon. I was surprised when their lips locked and they kissed deeply. “Oh fuck.” Davey said with wide eyes, and he took his hand off my leg to cover his crotch. This wasn’t exactly how I imagined this happening, but part of me had begun to wonder if maybe I wasn’t being a bit too obsessive about making my first time with Davey so ‘special’. “You should put your hand back where it was.” I whispered into Davey’s ear, leaning in closer to him. “It felt good there.” “Brian, don’t.” Davey almost whimpered as he turned to face me. There was a look of fear in his eyes, and we both tuned out Trevor and Brandon to look at each other. “Why not?” I asked, lifting a finger to run along his jawline. “Like Trevor said, it’s time for true confessions. You’ve done it before, haven’t you? With a guy?” “Don’t.” Davey whispered as tears formed in his eyes. “I can’t… you won’t… it’s all too perfect. I knew it had to end.” “What can’t you do?” I asked him. “I can’t just fucking do it with you the way I did with them.” He said with a jerk of his head to Brandon and Trevor where Brandon was pulling Trevor’s hard cock out of his uniform pants and going down on him. “Why not?” I asked him softly, ignoring my two friends who seemed to find a renewed attraction to each other after dumping their girlfriends. “Because I don’t want sex with you.” He said and looked away as my heart plummeted into the depths of my abdomen. How could he not be attracted to me? “You don’t think I’m good looking?” I asked him in wounded pride. “It’s not that.” Davey said with a sigh and he looked back at me. “I can’t be gay, what would my grandfather think? Or my mother?” “They’ll get over it in time.” I said with a slight shrug. “They love you Davey, and they’ll learn to accept that part of you as well, eventually. I won’t lie, it won’t be easy, but they will. Trust me.” “I do trust you.” He said and he leaned his forehead into me so that his was touching mine, and his hand reached out to rub along my leg. His body shivered as he did that, and mine did as well at the touch. “The problem is, I think I love you, Brian, and I can’t just have sex with you and pretend it never happened.” “Good.” I said so intently that he jerked his head back to stare at me with wide, surprised eyes. “Good?” He asked in confusion. “Yeah, it’s good.” I said in a husky voice and leaned in to kiss him. When he tried to pull his head back, my hand reached up and pulled his head towards me. As our lips met and my tongue teased against his lips, he let out a whimper that turned into a moan and as his mouth opened and my tongue snaked in against his, he moved quickly to pull me down with him until he was flat on his back amongst the hay on the floor, and I was laying on top of him. His hands roamed over my butt, kneading it and grasping it with passion while his tongue caressed mine oh so gently. I could feel his hard cock pushing out against mine, and moaned when he pulled his lips away from mine. There was a passion burning in his eyes and I smiled at the look of desire in there. “Why the fuck is it good, Brian?” Davey whispered forcefully as his eyes burned with fear and passion both at the same time. “Why the fuck is it good that I love you and I want to be with you the way two men can’t be, like normal people, get married?” “Because I love you too, Davey.” I said with a fierce passion burning in my throat and stinging tears into my eyes. “I don’t care what society or the church says, I want to spend my life with you, just you, forever. Do you hear that? I don’t care what anyone else says, just what you say and what I say, that’s all that really fucking matters. I want you.” “God forgive me.” Davey whimpered as he closed his eyes, and when he opened them they shined in a sky blue color that spoke of his love for me, and our lips tingled with electricity when they met again. “Holy fuck, I’m gonna cum just watching that.” Trevor’s voice was husky, and barely registered on my mind as Davey’s hands began undoing my belt buckle. It was much later that night before we stumbled back into the house. My gray pants had hay stuck in them, as did Davey’s hair, and we were both glad that the parents were already in bed. This time, when Davey stripped my uniform off of me, he did it slowly, as if he was unwrapping a precious and fragile present, and we explored each other for the third time that night, and the first time in my bed. Before, in that other time, we’d gone slowly, building up to the first time we had anal intercourse with each other, but this time I was buried deep in him on that first night, there in my bed. He whimpered and moaned in pleasure as I used all my decades of experience to prove to him I was the best lover he could ever imagine having. By the time we fell asleep, with me still buried inside of him and my bed a total mess, with a room that reeked of sex, the sun had begun to climb above the horizon. “Good morning.” I said a few hours later when Davey opened his eyes. I’d pulled out of him when I’d woken, and spent the minutes watching his face. His eyes held a hint of fear in them, until I leaned forward and kissed his lips softly. “Oh thank god.” Davey said softly. “It wasn’t a dream?” “You mean us telling each other that we love each other and fucking like rabbits?” I asked and he blushed before shyly nodding. “Nope, not a dream. Just remember you’re mine now. Don’t think you can get away just because I haven’t put a ring on this finger.” “We shouldn’t do this.” Davey whispered. “It’s wrong. What will your parents say?” “They’ll say it’s about time I showed some maturity and picked a good person to spend the rest of my life with.” I said fiercely and he gulped. “You mean that?” He asked. “I mean, my parents said they’d be there forever, and look what happened to them?” “My parents are still together, so let’s base our relationship on them, okay?” I asked and he looked at me for a long moment before nodding. “I’m scared.” He said with a shiver and held me tight against him. I was sore down there, but already getting erect again at the touch of him against me. “I am too, but we’ll get through this together, okay?” I asked and he nodded. “Brian, is Davey in there with you?” Dad asked as he knocked on the door. Davey looked scared shitless and tried to grab the blanket so he could hide under it, but given the way the room smelled of sex, if Dad opened the door it would be hopeless. “Yeah, he is.” I called out. “Oh good, by the way, you should really come out here.” Dad said with an edge to his voice. “There’s a message on the answering machine you should listen to real soon. If Davey’s asleep still, let him sleep it off.” “We’ll be out in just a minute.” I called out and waited until he’d moved off before getting out of bed and getting dressed quickly. What could the message be about? Brandon had stayed over at Trevor’s last night. Was it something else, or just someone from the team? “Dude, you look good in those.” I said when I realized Davey had pulled on my game pants from last night. He blushed and pulled them off, picking up a pair of gray sweatpants he’d mistaken the uniform for being. I had to push the sight out of my mind as I was wearing a blue pair of sweatpants and my erection was painfully obvious. It didn’t go down, though, until Davey came in and pulled the front of my sweatpants down to engulf the erection in his throat. All it took was for me to hit the back of his throat and my body jerked in an orgasm as I pulled roughly on his hair. He stood back up with a smile, gave my lips a quick peck and sauntered out the door, claiming the bathroom while I panted and stared after him while the sounds of his pissing could be faintly heard. With a shake of my head I went to the kitchen where Mom pointed to the answering machine without saying a word. She looked pissed, and I knew the call was something bad. While I hesitated with my finger over the play button, a grinning Davey came into the kitchen and got a glass before going to the fridge to pour a glass of orange juice. Mom glared at me again and motioned once more to the machine, and I pushed the button. When the machine began to play, I groaned at the sounds of female weeping. ‘Bbbrrr…Brian, this is Marcie.” She blubbered and I resisted the urge to hit delete. “We need to talk. I’m pregnant and it’s yours.” Davey’s glass shattering on the floor was a sound that reverberated through my mind as I felt my life crashing down around me. Chapter 11 “We should have an attorney here for this.” I muttered as I picked at the tie I was wearing. It was later in the afternoon on Sunday. Davey had left to go visit his grandfather and his sister as soon as he could leave. He hadn’t spoken to me at all, and I saw the hurt look on his face, like he’d been betrayed, and part of me understood that feeling in him. My parents and I had sat down for a heavy conversation after which Dad had called Marcie’s father, who had spent the first part of the conversation yelling at my father before agreeing to come over with his wife and daughter. Now we were all dressed up, waiting for them to arrive. Dad had dressed in his business suit, and I was wearing a dress shirt and tie as well as slacks while mom was wearing a similar suit to Dad’s except with a skirt. There had been some actual arguing, but I’d won the right to lead the conversation once they were here and sitting down, while Dad had won that we’d face them as a family first, without an attorney. This was a serious situation, all of us knew, and not something to be taken lightly. “Brian, we all agreed that we’ll start this like civilized people without resorting to attorneys.” Dad said and I bristled at the unspoken implication attorneys weren’t civilized. I’d been an attorney for most of my adult life, albeit I hadn’t practiced family law, ever. It would have been nice to consult some legal books for case histories, but there wasn’t access to any at this time. “I know.” I said anxiously as there was the sound of a car pulling up. When they rang the doorbell, and dad opened it, I knew this wasn’t going to be a fun exercise. Marcie was dressed to the hilt with a tight dress that showed off her bosom, a diamond necklace and earrings that were probably the ones that my other self had bought for her before I came back in time. She showed a firm expression on her face. Her father looked like he was going to hit me before he nodded at my father. He was wearing jeans and a flannel shirt while Marcie’s mother was wearing a simple but nice dress. “Mr. and Mrs. Ellsworth, please come in.” Dad said politely. “Would you like some tea, juice, or maybe some water?” Mom asked politely and all three of them shook their heads as Dad led us into the dining room. Marcie tried to reach out to grab my arm but I quickened my pace a bit so she couldn’t reach me without being too obvious. Dad sat down at the head of the table with Mr. Ellsworth at the other end. Mom sat on Dad’s right and I sat on his left. Marcie started to cross down to sit next to me before her father glared at her and she shifted to sit on the same side of the table as me but next to him. “Your son has gone and gotten my daughter pregnant, Breckenridge.” Mr. Ellsworth spat the words out like gunfire from a machine gun. “I want to know what you’re going to do about it.” “I’m going to listen to what my son has to say, and what your daughter has to say as well.” Dad said in a firm, even tone and Ellsworth bristled at that while his wife looked slightly uncomfortable. Ellsworth was a big bear of a man with dark bushy hair and a bushy beard while she was much smaller, although slightly plump and had mousy brown hair. How Marcie had gotten her looks from them I wasn’t quite sure, but some of her attitude could be explained by her father’s bearish manner. Then again, this was the first time that I had ever met the man. “What is there to say?” Ellsworth demanded harshly. “He got her pregnant and now he has to do the right thing. That’s all there is to say.” “How far along is the pregnancy according to the doctor?” I asked in a neutral tone, drawing their eyes to me and I noticed how Marcie squirmed. “She hasn’t been to a doctor yet.” Mr. Ellsworth fumed. “We can’t afford the bill. You’ll have to pay for this.” “If she is pregnant, and if the child is mine, then yes I’ll be responsible for her pre-natal related medical expenses.” I said, ignoring the looks of faint surprise on the faces of my mother and father and focusing on the outrage on Mr. Ellsworth’s face. “A woman knows if she’s pregnant!” Mrs. Ellsworth spoke up for the first time looking at me with angry indignation while her husband roared. “What do you mean if it’s yours? Of course it’s yours!” “With all due respect to you as a mother, Mrs. Ellsworth, your daughter has proven herself to be a lying and manipulative young women with no hint of a conscience or morals.” I said and ignored Mr. Ellsworth’s roar of anger and his slapping the table before demanding an apology from me. “Mr. Ellsworth, calm down before you become the second member of your family to have the police called after attempting to damage the property of me and my family.” “What are you talking about?” Mrs. Ellsworth asked as her husband’s face turned purple and my dad looked at me with surprise and worry. “Don’t tell me you don’t know your daughter was arrested for trying to vandalize my car.” I asked with a lift of my eyebrow. “She told me that was just a misunderstanding.” She said with a frown. “It was just a joke that got out of hand.” “Ma’am, with all due respect, your daughter lied to you.” I said. “I did not!” Marcie cried out. “I just got a little overwrought and you got upset. You told me you loved me and would spend the rest of your life with me and then you changed and dropped me and now I’m pregnant with your baby!” “You may be pregnant, with a child that may not be mine.” I said coldly and she started to cry, drawing an angry look at me from her father who put an arm around her. “Who else would it be?” He demanded angrily. “Let’s see, Marcie has bragged at school about having slept with Mark Spencer after she broke up with me, and I saw her giving fellatio to him in his car so that’s a real possibility.” I said casually and Marcie shouted her innocence while her dad roared at me that I was lying. “Then, of course, while she was dating him, she told her friend she was also sleeping with Chad Kipple. Then my friends have told me that even while she was dating me she cheated on me with two other guys, neither of whom attend our high school.” “You liar!” Mr. Ellsworth roared, pointing a meaty finger at me. “You deflowered her, stole her virginity. She told me that herself! She’s never been in a serious relationship with anyone but you!” “Mr. Ellsworth, if there is one thing I’m certain of it is that your daughter has never had a serious relationship with anyone or anything, and most especially she’s not even a passing acquaintance of the truth. She’s a natural-born liar.” “How dare you!” Marcie wailed. “This is all the fault of that creep you’ve been hanging around, the one who convinced you to break up with me.” “Can you not tell the truth even now?” I asked with scorn in my voice. “Or have you really forgotten that you dumped me and told me I’d have to come crawling on my knees to get you back.” “I did not!” She exclaimed before burying her face in her heads and shaking her shoulders with what I was sure were fake sobs. “Now look at what you’ve done!” Mrs. Ellsworth wailed while getting up and going around to her daughter and pulling her in tightly so that Marcie buried her face against her mother’s bosom while Mrs. Ellsworth glared at me. “And to think I thought you were such a nice boy!” “To think I thought your daughter cared about anyone or anything other than herself.” I snorted and my dad touched my arm in a warning gesture. “Be that as it may, here is what I am prepared to offer. First off, we’ll set up a trust account to cover any pre-natal bills if the child is proven to be mine. Second, if and only if a paternity test comes back positive that I’m the father, we will arrange child support payments until the child is eighteen, if she is granted custody of the child by the courts.” “What do you mean if the child is yours?” Marcie’s father demanded. “It can’t be anyone’s but yours.” “We’ll see when the paternity test is done.” I said firmly. “Brian, just marry me and we won’t have to worry about any of this.” Marcie said as she pulled her face out of mother’s bosom. “You said you loved me, why won’t you just marry me?” “If I ever loved you, what you’ve done since January has cured me of that forever.” I said to her coldly and she let out a wail. “I wouldn’t want a little piece of shit like you as a son-in-law anyway.” Mr. Ellsworth snarled as he stood up. “You’ll be hearing from our attorney.” “You’ll be hearing from ours as well.” My father said as he also stood up. “It’ll start with a lawsuit requiring your daughter to submit to an exam by a qualified physician to determine if your daughter really is pregnant. Then it’ll require a paternity test, and you better pray Brian is the father, because if he isn’t, we’ll sue you for libel and defamation of character and take every damn penny you have.” “Oh yeah, well you’ll be sorry your family ever crossed paths with mine!” Ellsworth roared before bustling his daughter and wife out of the house. Dad followed them and Mom let out a long breath while shaking her head. “Brian, I wish you’d never gotten involved with that girl.” She said softly and I chortled softly. “So do I, Mom, so do I.” I agreed with her fervently. “Brian, I don’t know what you think you were doing, but calling a man’s daughter a slut to his face does not make you friends.” Dad said as he reentered the room and sat down. “Dad, I knew that if Marcie’s parents were anything like her, giving them an inch would have been as good as giving them the whole game.” I said. “Do you think the child’s yours?” Dad asked and I shrugged. “I sure as hell hope not.” I said. “I promise one thing though, nothing like this will ever happen again.” “I sure hope not.” Dad said and he gave me a long look. He took a swallow as if he was nervous and I realized he had probably figured me and Davey out. “I’d much rather have Davey as part of the family than anyone like that.” “So would I, Dad.” I said as Mom watched me for my reaction. There was nervousness in my gut, but they both nodded slowly. “You might want to open a window next time he spends the night in your room.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Yeah.” I agreed with a blush of my cheeks. “So, is this… thing with him serious?” Dad asked. “Have you two actually… talked? How long has it been going on?” “It’s very serious, at least on my part and I’m pretty sure on his as well.” I said softly. “He’s probably hurting right now from all this other stuff, I think that’s why he left like that. We’ve talked a little, but not enough, and as for how long, last night was the first time.” “I’ve always said you were a lot like your Uncle Rich.” Mom said with a shake of her head and a penetrating look at me. “Is that why you were with that… that girl? You were still upset over Uncle Rich and didn’t want to be like him.” “You really do know me.” I said with a sad smile and she nodded. “I can understand that, son, but you can see what a mess this is.” Dad said with a sad shake of his head. “Don’t get me wrong, we’ll always love you, but you have to know we’re disappointed in you over this whole mess, and you’ve hurt Davey. I’m not sure you and him… getting to know each other better at this point was necessarily a good thing.” “The timing could be better, but that’s par for the course.” I said with a shrug remembering all the times that life had intruded on my life with Davey. Something moved into place inside of me and I knew it was time to tell all my secrets, or nearly all of them. “Mom, Dad, we need to talk, about a couple of things, not just this, but I’d like Davey to be there. He’s an important part of my life.” “When he gets back, or tomorrow evening after school we can all talk.” Dad said with a heavy sigh. “Until then, how about we stick our heads in the sand?” “That sounds good to me.” Mom said with a sigh of her own and I nodded my agreement. I didn’t quite ignore things the rest of the day, since I called both Brandon and Trevor to tell them what was going on with Marcie. Both of them were outraged, and promised to support me if I needed their help. That helped a bit, that they were sticking by me now. It was hard to admit to myself that I had missed them as much as I really had. Davey never came home that night. He did call to tell Mom that he’d be staying over at his grandparents. Mom tried to get him to promise to come over after school, but he backed away from that commitment. It hurt, but I had faith that we’d manage to work through this problem like any other I’d ever experienced with Davey. All night I tossed and turned, thinking about things and how to explain them to him, and to my parents. When dawn came, I’d slept very little and got up in a tired state that not even a shower and a short morning run could quite solve. Even as I pulled into the parking lot it felt like everyone was staring at me and whispering behind their hands. Had Marcie shouted it from the hilltops that I’d gotten her pregnant? I was surprised when I walked between a row of classrooms and the gym to find someone waiting for me. Katie looked nervous, and kept on looking around as if to make sure no one saw her talking to me.",

      "content": "“What is it, Katie?” I asked her in a short tone of voice. “Marcie’s spreading it around school that you got her pregnant.” Katie said in a hushed voice. “It takes two to tango, and we still don’t know which guy was dancing with her when she got bit.” I said and Katie actually snorted as if she was holding back a laugh. “That’s not quite true.” She said in a quiet voice. “The day you broke up with her, you remember, after that New Year’s party?” “Yes.” I answered. “She was complaining that she’d gotten pissy with you because she was on her period.” Katie said. “Then she asked to borrow a pad from me because she was out.” “If she was having her period after the last time we had sex…” I said with a sudden swelling of hope inside me. I’d been right; even if she was pregnant there was no way it was mine! “I… what she’s doing is wrong.” Katie said. “She’s fixated on you like a bitch in heat but it’s obvious you want nothing to do with her and she’s trying to trap you. It’s wrong. I’m sorry, you should know, but I won’t admit it if you tell anyone. Her little brother’s already threatened to beat me up if I mentioned it to anyone.” “Her little brother knows?” I asked in surprise. “She really is pregnant, Brian.” Katie said in a rush. “It’s just not yours. Too bad for you your family has more money than any of the other guys she’s fooled around with, so they’re going after you to get what money you guys have.” “Her entire family knows?” I said incredulously while she nodded. “Just remember I didn’t tell you any of this!” She said in a rush before turning and heading away at a very quick walk. “You couldn’t pay me enough to have your life, Breckenridge.” Coach Cole’s voice said from behind me and I turned to see him walking around the side of the gym. “You heard?” I asked him and he nodded. “Let’s go in my office and talk.” He suggested and I nodded before following him inside. I’d been continuing with the NJROTC two times a week and had even got a reluctant Davey to join. When he had shut the door and we were seated in his office, he shook his head. “So your ex-girlfriend is trying to trap you into marrying her?” “Something like that, yeah.” I said and told him the whole story from the message on the answering machine to the explosive meeting at my house. I even found myself telling him how Davey had left and not come back. “Hm.” He said with a chuckle. “You and Davey, I didn’t see that one coming.” “I–we–we’re not…” I started to protest but he waved me off. “Breckenridge, I’ve seen the way he looks at you during practice and I wasn’t born yesterday.” Cole was nearly chuckling. “I won’t say I’m exactly comfortable with it, but let’s just say that I got use to turning a blind eye at times in the Navy and I see nothing wrong with continuing that here. You aren’t the only two boys I’ve seen making eyes at each other in this gym.” “I bet.” I said while thinking of Trevor and Brandon who seemed to be developing more and more of a relationship with each other. That surprised me, at least on Trevor’s part since he’d always grown out of his man-on-man attraction by college and gone off to marry a girl, at least according to Davey he’d done that in every other timeline. “Well I’m not going to name names, but let’s get back to your ex.” Cole said with a shake of his head. “What are you going to do about her?” “Call her a slut and demand a paternity test.” I answered. “That was always the plan but after that little conversation you overheard, it’s sounding even better since the paternity test will end the issue forever.” “Six or seven months is a long time, Breckenridge.” Cole reminded me. “A lot can happen in that time and if people start believing her, it won’t matter what the paternity test says, they’ll still believe it’s your kid.” “I know.” I said with a shrug. “That’s where calling her a slut comes into play. Enough people believe she’s a slut and nothing she says will stick, and every guy who has ever fucked her will go scurrying for cover and repeat that she’s a slut just to keep people from thinking it might be theirs.” “Breckenridge, I’m never going to play poker with you.” He said with a laugh after thinking what I’d said over. “You’re ruthless.” “When I have to be, I can be.” I said with a slight smile that I knew looked wicked on me and he shivered visibly. “I’ve learned from the best.” “Who is that?” He asked and I shrugged, realizing I really shouldn’t have said that last part. I’d learned ruthlessness from Davey Jones, but a different Davey Jones than the one he knew. When I didn’t answer, he changed subjects. “Have you given thought to what you might be doing to this baby before it’s even born? Maybe about how your rumor campaign might affect it’s life?” “Nothing I could do would make it any worse for a kid born into that conniving bunch that Marcie calls a family.” I said angrily. “You have a point.” Cole agreed with a nod. “It’s getting close to time for school to start.” “Thanks for the talk, coach.” I said as I stood up to leave. “Not a problem.” Cole said dismissively as I left his office and wondered if I could find Davey before first period. Davey managed to elude me most of the day, mostly because I kept on getting stopped by people to ask if it was true that I’d gotten Marcie pregnant. Most of them had reacted with shock at the blunt way I called her a slut and until the baby was born God was the only one who could possibly know whose kid it really was. Her little brother confronted me at lunchtime, furious that I was calling his sister a slut, and probably more upset that so many people believed that claim. Before he could take a swing at me, Brandon and Trevor had restrained him and I walked away before a teacher could notice. He didn’t bother me after that, and my friends were chuckling at the way the rumors were spreading like wildfire. Marcie had fired her salvo, trying to pin her pregnancy on me, but the day wasn’t even half over before people were starting to form betting pools on who the real father was. During the last P.E. period, I heard Adam turn to Davey and ask him who he was betting for the real father of Marcie’s baby. Davey’s face was a look in priceless shock when he didn’t hear my name on the list at all. “What about Brian?” Davey asked in a sharp tone and a scathing look at me. “Didn’t he sleep with her too?” “Yeah, but he’s probably the only one smart enough to use a condom with a slut like that.” Adam laughed and Davey looked at me with a calculating look. “Your mom said you wanted to talk to them and me after school.” Davey said later, during a slow moment in baseball practice. “I’d like to, yes.” I said softly, not wanting to say anything that could upset him at this point. “Do you think the kid’s yours?” He asked me icily. “I know it’s not.” I said with conviction. “How do you know that?” He asked. “My parents deserve to hear it at the same time as you, and you deserve to hear it at the same time they do.” I told him with a voice that quivered a bit. “You’re just as important to me as they are.” “Am I?” Davey asked and I nodded. “I’ll be there.” He said and walked off while I breathed a sigh of relief. Davey followed me home from practice, and I was in such a hurry that I didn’t even bother to change out of my practice uniform before taking off. Davey had to hurry to catch up before I pulled out of the parking lot, and I noticed him watching my butt as I walked to my car. I’d had these particular practice pants since I was a freshman, and they were tight on me. It’d be a cold day in hell before I admitted to him that I’d worn them today on purpose, knowing how he liked looking at me in tight clothes. Dad was home as we pulled up, having stayed in Modesto and worked from home most of the day. Mom was there and while she frowned at the fact that I hadn’t changed, she noted that I was at least carrying my cleats instead of wearing them inside. I took just enough time to put them up in my room before hurrying back to the living room and sitting down on the towel she’d put on the couch. My uniform wasn’t that dirty, but it wasn’t worth mentioning at this point. “Davey, thanks for being here.” I said to Davey first, who was sitting on the far end of the couch but looking at me steadily while my parents sat on the loveseat and watched me. “Mom, Dad, first off I should thank you too for supporting me in this. It’s not over yet, and it won’t be until we get that… that girl to take a paternity test. The really good news is that when we get that paternity test we’ll be out of this mess.” “You’re sure about that?” Mom asked with concern in her voice. “I am now.” I assured her. “One of Marcie’s former friends told me in secret that the day she broke up with me, after the last time we – we had intercourse – Marcie was having her period and borrowed a pad from her. There’s no way the baby could be mine.” “Could this girl be lying to you?” Dad asked. “She could, but I doubt that’s the case.” I answered. “She has no reason to lie to me, it’s not helpful to Marcie, and well, she also let it slip that Marcie’s little brother was threatening her if she told anyone. It seems like Marcie’s entire family is in on this.” “I’ve taken two calls from her father today, and the last time he threatened to burn our house down if we don’t make you marry her.” Dad said with a frown. “I am so glad to hear there’s no real chance the kid’s yours. The thought of there being any relation between us and them is distasteful. Now that you’re certain, I’m going to report his threats to the police.” “You are?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow as he scooted a little closer to me on the couch. I think no one missed that gesture, and Mom smiled. “Of course I am.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “If they are threatening my family, I’ll take whatever steps I can to protect them, including calling the police.” “You want to be careful with that.” Davey said sadly. “Sometimes, when you do that, the press can get involved. Maybe I shouldn’t spend so much time here, if they get wind of my name and threats against you, they’d definitely jump on the story and I don’t want to put you folks through that. You’ve done too much for me as it is.” “You’re going nowhere young man.” Dad said firmly and with a hint of anger in his voice. “If that happens, we’ll deal with it but I won’t run you off because of a possibility of a story or two in the local rag.” “You don’t know what it’s like.” Davey murmured, but he also looked relieved that dad was insisting he stay. “Davey, we know you and your family well enough now to have some idea.” Mom said while meeting his gaze. “We’re not worried about that. We can deal with it, and we’re not ashamed of you, or of Brian.” “Nor would we be ashamed of either of you, or both of you, if that ever came out either.” Dad said and Davey’s hiss of indrawn breath filled the room and he looked at me with terror in his eyes while Dad actually laughed. So did Mom, and Davey started to relax when he realized they weren’t mocking him, or us. I reached out and took his hand, and at first he resisted, but when I persisted he exhaled and gripped my hand with a death grip. “Believe me when I say we’d rather have you as part of our family than the alternatives.” Mom said and then she frowned. “That didn’t come out quite right. I wouldn’t want you to think I was comparing you to that… girl. There is no comparison, really. For starters, we actually like you whether you’re a part of Brian’s life or not.” “How did you know?” He asked in a weak voice and his hand was shaking as it grasped mine so tightly it hurt. He relaxed a bit as I moved my hands so that our fingers were entwined in a more comfortable grip. “Next time you spend the night in Brian’s room, you should open the window and air out the room.” Dad laughed and Mom blushed, although Davey’s cheeks were rosier than hers. “I don’t think we’ll… I mean… oh fuck, I give up.” Davey murmured and Dad laughed. “You know my parents would be having fits at just the thought and I’m here holding Brian’s hand and you’re laughing at us! It’s not fair! I’m not prepared for this!” “Would you rather we tried to break you up?” Mom asked through her laughter. “No.” Davey said softly as he squeezed my hand and turned to look at me before sliding closer to me, close enough to lean against me. “Are we still together after the way I just ran out on you when you probably needed me?” “Don’t worry about that.” I assured him. “You’re here now.” “Yes, well do we have anymore to discuss or should I start dinner?” Mom asked and I let out a sigh of my own. “You better order a pizza or Chinese.” I told her and she frowned. “That was the easy stuff to discuss.” “The easy stuff?” Dad asked with a hint of horror in his voice and he frowned at my nod. “If that’s the easy stuff, I think maybe we should wait until after we eat.” “No.” I said with a hint of pleading in my voice. “If you make me wait, I think I’ll lose my nerve to tell you, all of you?” “Brian, don’t tell me you’ve killed someone.” Mom said with genuine horror in her voice. “No mom, I haven’t killed anyone in the last fifty years.” I assured her, and transitioned into the real purpose of this little family meeting. “I didn’t have a choice then; the Iraqis had attacked our convoy and were trying to take hostages. Davey was the one who picked up a rifle from a fallen Iraqi Army soldier and started fighting back. I just followed his lead.” “You’re not making any sense.” Dad said with a wild look in his eyes while Davey stared at me like I’d gone crazy. “What are you saying?” “Don’t tell me you’re another Mr. Shelton.” Davey groaned, referencing a seventh grade World History teacher at La Loma. Deranged Mr. Shelton believed in reincarnation and would launch into fanciful stories about having lived through the Black Death in medieval Europe. “No, I’m not talking about reincarnation.” I answered Davey while my parents were starting to look like I’d cracked and gone insane on them. “Although, the more I think about it, reincarnation is damn close, except it’s not being reborn into a whole new life, except in this case it kind of is, but not really.” “Brian, you’re not making sense.” Dad said sternly. “What are you going on about?” “Mr. Shelton was a teacher at La Loma.” Davey started to explain. “I remember the man.” Dad said sharply. “I’m asking what the hell it is Brian’s trying to tell us and failing at so miserably.” “Sorry, it’s really complicated and I’m nervous.” I said in all honesty and realized my hand was shaking slightly in Davey’s. He squeezed it in a comforting gesture and I relaxed a bit. These were my parents and Davey. I’d planned this out while I tossed and turned last night, I knew how to approach this logically, I just needed to calm down. “Why don’t you start at the beginning, then?” Dad suggested and I nodded, taking a deep breath and preparing to begin. “The bottom line of the story is that time travel is more than just possible, it’s a reality.” I said in a much calmer breath, ignoring the looks of continued confusion on their faces or the hiss of indrawn breath from Davey. He’d always been a fan of science fiction and was probably better suited to understanding this than my parents. “In the year 2004 of the original timeline, which is this time we’re in right now, a scientist conducted an experiment that would send the memories, the consciousness if you will, of a person back in time to his younger self.” “And you’re this time traveler.” Davey asked, grasping the idea and for the moment at least, he appeared to be withholding his disbelief. My parents were looking at me like I was crazy. “No, that first time traveler was you, Davey.” I told him and his eyes widened and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I don’t remember anything about the future.” He said quietly. “No you wouldn’t, because we jammed that before it could happen.” I stated. “The thing you have to understand about time travel is that cause and effect can happen simultaneously, or effect preceding cause. In this case, when I came back in time, it was 2054 and we sent a signal that jammed any other transmission that would send a person’s memories back in time.” “Huh?” Dad asked with wide eyes and an incredulous expression. “Are you trying to say you’re eighty-five years old?” Mom asked in a breathy voice. “No, I have the memories of eighty-five years of life in another timeline, but it’s a very different timeline than this one.” I said. “Let’s go back to the beginning on this.” Dad said in an exasperated voice. “It all started in 2004 of this timeline.” I repeated. “A scientist in Livermore built the first working time machine and he tested it out on a man named Davey Jones. Davey traveled back in time, or at least his memories and consciousness traveled back in time, and he woke up in his twelve-year old body on August 1st of 1981.” “This is for real, not a joke?” Dad demanded and I nodded. His sat back in the loveseat and weakly waved a hand for me to on. “Davey thought something had gone wrong with the experiment.” I continued. “He had been told he’d only be able to see events from his young perspective. Instead he found he was in full control of his body, and as days turned into weeks, he realized that he was there to stay. At first he tried to keep from changing anything, but on the first day of the seventh grade he ended up becoming friends with a guy named Brian Breckenridge and two others named Brandon and Trevor.” “You weren’t friends with him back then.” Mom said astutely. “Not in the original timeline, but when he went back in time and made the first change, Davey created a new timeline, what we call Timeline Two.” I explained and she nodded almost as if she was following this explanation. Davey was getting it from the look in his eyes. “I bet I tried to stop my dad from molesting my sister.” Davey said in a weak voice. “That was one of the modest goals that Davey set when he realized he could change the timeline without destroying the universe.” I agreed. “Along the way it was discovered that other time travelers had come back in time and the government found out about Davey.” “Oh shit, I bet that wasn’t good.” Davey said stolidly and Dad shook his head. “What’d they do?” Mom asked as she leaned forward. “Fortunately for Davey, he’d made good friends, and one of those friend’s father had good connections.” I continued. “You see, Mr. Rush, Trevor’s father, he’s not really what he seems.” “Is he another time traveler?” Dad asked. “No, he’s a Soviet defector.” I said and Dad’s eyes widened while mother covered her mouth with a hand. “You’re kidding!” Mom gasped. “No, I’m serious, although I guess you could try to confirm that.” I said with a shrug. “I don’t know how they’d react in this timeline, but eventually it becomes more public knowledge after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” “The Soviet Union collapses?” Dad asked in shock and I chuckled. Davey had said that was the one fact that always made the biggest impact on people in the 1980’s. No one thought the massive juggernaut that was the evil Soviet Union could possibly collapse in on itself like it had so many times in history. “It did in the original timeline and several other timelines except the one where they went to war to keep it from happening.” I said. “How many of these timelines are there?” Davey asked. “This would be Timeline Four if you counted just the timelines created by Davey Jones going back in time.” I answered and he looked surprised. “Most of us call it Timeline Five though because Sean Rule came back to save Davey at the end of Timeline Two when the Soviets sank his ship during that timeline’s World War Three.” “What?” Mom nearly shrieked. “I know that name.” Davey said with a frown. “Didn’t he go to school with us?” “Mighty convenient.” Dad said skeptically. “Sean’s the one who picked Davey as a test subject in the first experiment.” I explained and Dad shook his head. “Two other men went back into that first Timeline. One of them was the scientist who created the device, but he died in an accident. The other was a pro-Soviet Russian who wanted to keep the Soviet Union from collapsing. He almost succeeded, but he was forced into open warfare against the United States. By that time, Davey was a known time traveler, at least by President Reagan and his close advisors. He fought in the Navy during that Timeline’s World War Three. At first, he died when his ship sunk, but Sean Rule came back in time to help him.” “How did that happen if the timeline changed when that Davey went back?” Mom asked and I was surprised at how intuitively she understood this. “The time machine creates a bubble in sub-space that lasts as long as the time machine has power.” I answered her question. “Sean Rule was the last person alive in that bubble and he used the machine’s last bit of power to go back far enough in time to warn the President, who issued orders that saved the original Davey Jones from death and ended World War Three.” “That would deserve a ‘and they lived happily ever after, but they didn’t, did they?” Mom asked and I smiled. “Davey and that timeline’s Brian lived together as a couple for a long time.” I half-answered her question as Davey squeezed my hand. There was a small smile on his face. “So what happened next?” Dad asked as he leaned forward, looking interested. “In Timeline Two’s 2004, a war broke out with mainland China and Taiwan.” I continued my story and was relieved that they were at least listening instead of calling for the men with the straight jackets. “Admiral Davey Jones led US naval forces in the area to a crushing defeat of the attempted Chinese invasion, but the entire war was a diversion. They had kidnapped Sean Rule, the only person who had a working knowledge of how to build a time machine and used him to complete their own time machine. They held his partner, Brandon Walker, and Davey Jones’s partner Brian, hostage. Davey led a SEAL team into the facility but he was too late to stop a Chinese agent from going back in time. He was mortally wounded in the gunfight and went back in time again before he died from his wounds.” “Jesus, it’s like a good sci-fi story.” Davey commented uneasily. “I’m not sure who you think I am but that Davey Jones sounds a bit like Superman.” “No, he wasn’t Superman.” I said with a fond smile on my face. “He was just damn close to the real thing. He knew what he thought was right and he fought for it tooth and nail, and he was damn smart. You have to remember, by that 2004 he had over six decades of life experience behind him but he was only in his early thirties.” “That would be… interesting.” Dad said softly. “Hold on just a minute while I get us some food.” Mom said standing quickly and we sat in silence, just staring at each other until she returned with a tray of fruit, cheeses, and crackers as well as a pitcher of ice tea and four glasses. While everyone munched down, I continued the story, taking them through what I knew of that horrible timeline, Timeline Three and its ending in nuclear annihilation of most of the Earth. “It’s like a love story.” Mom said with tears bristling in her eyes when I recounted the death of my other self from that timeline. I had to agree with her, it was both supremely tragic and awful sweet at the same time. “It’s a sick love story.” Dad said, but he was smirking a bit. “So our intrepid hero Davey Jones goes back once more, right? Does his trusty sidekick Sean go back too?” “Yeah, he does, after a fashion.” I said with a smile at that description of Sean who no one here except Davey had ever met. “This time, Davey ended up back in 1976 instead of the early 1980’s.” “Wait, before or after we moved back from Florida?” Davey said with excitement. “After, but boy did Davey make some changes in that timeline.” I continued. “His seven-year old body couldn’t handle the memories of an adult nearly a hundred, so the brain began to shut down after a short while. Before it did, he really made some big-ass changes.” “Like what?” Davey asked with a light in his eyes. “He got his grandfather to place a few key bets, winning a heck of a lot of money.” I said. “He used that to manipulate his dad into giving up preaching and running for the State Assembly.” “You’re kidding!” Davey exclaimed. “No, and for a while Davey went into a coma while his brain returned to its normal seven-year old function, but Davey had set up a system where he was able to warn key people about big problems that were coming up.” I continued with a wistful expression on my face. “Some of those changes included an early warning about AIDS, and it saved Uncle Rich’s life.” “Oh my.” Mom said as tears came to her eyes and Dad put a comforting hand on her leg. She leaned into him for a bit of support. “Yes, well, eventually Davey’s brain matured enough that his ‘older’ self woke up again, and he set more changes into place.” I continued. “His father went from a member of the California Assembly to a member of the President’s cabinet and ended up the Secretary of Agriculture. Davey and Brian were friends for several years before they started dating.” “And dad, he never…” Davey’s voice faltered, unable to speak the question. “No, Davey’s sister was never molested, and she ended up being a fighter pilot in the Air Force and one of the highest ranking female combat veterans in the history of the Armed Forces.” I answered and he shook his head in disbelief before a smile appeared on his face. “It sounds like paradise.” Davey whispered. “I haven’t even mentioned that David Jones Sr. eventually became President in that timeline, the timeline I was born in.” I said softly and Dad snorted in disbelief. “You almost had me going there, Brian.” Dad said. “You should write this down and sell it.” “I’m being serious, dad.” I said. “I was born in that timeline, Timeline Four.” “Then why are you here now?” Mom asked and I smiled sadly. “I assume you and that super-Davey lived a long happy life together?” “We did, with two kids, half a dozen grandkids and dozens of great-grandkids.” I answered and Davey squeezed my hand at those words. “We had a family together?” Davey asked and I smiled at him. “I told you it was possible the other night.” I reminded him and he nodded after a moment. “So what happened?” Mom asked. “Terrorists, probably a Dhu Ghal branch from Ireland managed to get a dirty bomb into Washington D.C.” I answered her question and she looked confused. “That’s a super-long story, but Dhu Ghal was an Irish separatist movement that started after the European Common cracked down on member states. The United States helped them at first, giving them weapons because the EC was trashing the US economy. Then they reached an agreement with the EC and they abandoned Dhu Ghal. When that happened, Dhu Ghal decided to teach the US a lesson and set off a dirty bomb they’d gotten from our country. Washington D.C. was irradiated by deadly amounts of radiation, poisoning most of Congress. “Every President since David Jones Sr. had been made aware of Project Do Over. Davey and Sean had built a time machine, just in case it was ever needed, and President White authorized a Do Over. Sean and I, the only two with the codes who could activate the machine used it to do two things.” “What happened to me, to the Davey who’d gone back all those other times, I mean.” Davey asked and I sighed. “He had a stroke before the bomb went off and couldn’t help out.” I said feeling the grief at that memory well up inside of me, and my voice shook as I spoke. The comforting grip of his hand reassured me though and I blinked away the tears from my eyes. “I loved him, but he couldn’t help, so I went with Sean to activate the time machine. The first thing we did was set off a jamming device that Sean and Brandon came up with over the years. It effectively wiped out the other time travelers and reset the timeline to the original one, the one that would have progressed if time travel had never been invented.” “Then why did you come back?” Dad asked with his eyebrows furrowed. “It seems to me if you took the trouble to undo time travel you’d have left it at that.” “It seems terrorism is a bigger threat than we had imagined.” I said and Dad’s frown deepened. “Then why come back this far again?” Mom asked. “To give me time to think about the problem, and work towards a fix.” I explained. “It’s not something that can change with just a bit of knowledge, but it’s going to take a lifetime, at least, so we went as far back as we had the power to go. I’m sorry Davey, I’d have come back further to stop what happened to your sister if I could.” “I believe that.” Davey said simply, and his trust bolstered my confidence. “What happened to the Brian of this timeline?” Dad asked and I sighed. This was the question I feared the most. “When I came back, his memories were overwritten in favor of mine.” I said. “But you are our son, our Brian.” Mom asked. “Yes and no.” I answered. “You see, much of this timeline, it’s very similar to Davey’s original timeline, although now there are differences since I came back. In that original timeline, Davey and Brian were never friends. I’m pretty sure the original Brian married Marcie and had kids with her. Our lives were mostly the same though, except for the time that Davey struck me out in little league when we were real young, and then later when we became friends in junior high. That never happened here, of course.” “This is confusing.” Dad said simply, but he looked me in the eyes for several minutes before continuing. “You are, but you aren’t quite our son is what you’re saying. It wasn’t you who dated and… and slept with Marcie.” “That’s correct.” I answered. “I think we need some time to think this over.” Dad said softly and I stood up. “You should know, there are some differences in the parents I knew from the last timeline and you, but there aren’t many. You’re as much my parents as they were, and I’m as much your son as the Brian who was here before I came back that night in January. I think you can figure out which night it was.” I said in a rush. “That’s one thing I understand about this.” Dad said softly. “Just give us a few minutes, please, son?” “Okay, dad.” I said with a sigh of relief that he still thought of me as his son. Davey followed me as I went to my bedroom, and he shut the door behind me. I was too scared to turn around and look in his eyes. That wasn’t necessary, though, because he stepped up behind me and wrapped his arms around me, his hands rubbing my crotch through my practice pants. “Dude, that’s some fucking story.” He said as he nibbled on my neck. “What are you doing?” I asked him with a little surprise. “Taking advantage of your old ass.” Davey joked and I turned around in his grasp with surprise writ in large letters across my face. “You’re not…you’re not like grossed out or anything?” I asked him with surprise. When I’d been in his shoes it had taken me days to adjust to this news. “Dude, we’re like star-crossed lovers who chase each other across time.” Davey said with a wicked smile as he pecked at my lips. “If there’s anything that could be more fucking romantic or reassuring that we’re meant to be, I don’t know what it could possibly be. It’s like after hearing that story I know we’re meant to be together and I could care less who knows. Do you know how hot you look dressed like this? You drove me fucking crazy all afternoon and now, now I just don’t care. It’s like I can say whatever I want because nothing can come between us and I know this is what we’re meant to be, together.” “Kiss me.” I growled, not quite understanding his logic, but agreeing we were meant to be together. In another time, it had taken me days to realize that very same thing. Once again, Davey had proven just how much smarter than he was than I. He was also one hell of a kisser, I realized yet again as I came perilously close to an orgasm just from him kissing me. Nothing else really mattered in the end, I was here, with Davey, and together nothing could stop us. Nothing. Chapter 12 Davey and I did little more than kiss and grope each other a bit before my parents knocked on the door to tell us that dinner had been ordered. Davey sighed as I mentioned that I was going to take a shower and get changed, but he gave me one final kiss before leaving the room. When I was showered and changed, the conversation continued while we ate Chinese. “We’ve reached the conclusion that our son is either very deranged, or something we can’t quite understand has happened.” Dad said as we all filled our plates with the food. He and Mom looked worn out already, and Mom had a sad expression on her face. “What we don’t understand is, if this is true, what happened to our Brian.” Mom said quietly, moving the food around on her plate without taking a bite. “I am ‘your’ Brian.” I answered emphatically. “The only difference is that I have more memories than I did before January, and I’ve lost a few memories. Everything else about me is the same.” “I don’t think that’s quite accurate.” Dad said with a frown and a significant look at Davey. “I’ll be blunt about this.” I said firmly, catching the eyes of both of them before continuing. “I’ve always been bi-sexual, attracted to both guys and girls. Before January, I might have allowed myself to believe that Marcie was the girl I loved, but I know better now.” “How do you know that?” Davey asked, speaking up after hurriedly swallowing a bite of chow mien. “I’m not the same Davey Jones you fell in love with in that other timeline.” “Yes, you are.” I said passionately. “You may not have all the memories that he had, but you are the same person.” “That just doesn’t make sense.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Our experiences are part of who we are as people.” “Mom, is Dad the same person you married?” I asked her pointedly. “Is he exactly the same as he was when you met him and fell in love?” “No, and that’s my point.” Mom argued. “It’s the experiences we’ve had since we got married that make us who we are today. How can you say you’re our son when you don’t have the memories of us, the memories he should have from the time he was born?” “I do have most of the same memories.” I countered. “My life in this timeline and in my original timeline was much the same, except for a few minor events. They didn’t start to differ at all until 1981.” “But that’s five years of changed memories.” Mom asserted. “You’re not him, and I want to understand what happened to him.” “He’s here, in me, and I’m in him.” I argued. “We’re one and the same. It’s like I’ve got amnesia of those years, and memories of other years.” “I don’t know if I can accept that.” Mom muttered. “It’s like my son died and was replaced by an imposter.” “Do you remember when we visited Uncle Rich back in ’78?” I asked her. “We got into that argument and I stormed out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. You spent two hours driving around San Francisco looking for me and I was in the back seat of the car the entire time. You hit a light pole when I sat up in the back seat and asked what you were doing.” “You remember that?” Mom asked with wide eyes. “I told you, I am your son!” I stated emphatically. “It’s just that I have slightly different memories of a few years.” There was silence around the table while everyone picked at their food. Nearly twenty minutes passed before anyone spoke again. “So how old are you?” Dad asked, breaking the long silence. “Are you in your eighties or are you seventeen?” “I’m seventeen with a lot more memories than your average seventeen-year-old.” I answered. “ “You said your timeline was different from this one, but that there’s a lot of things the same.” Davey said next. “When the Challenger blew up, you said it was something wrong with the O-rings on the booster. Is that how you knew, because it blew up in your timeline?” “No, it never blew up.” I shrugged. “It blew up in the original timeline that Davey was from. In nearly every subsequent timeline he managed to stop it from happening, and a few other events from happening as well. Other things, like earthquakes, hurricanes, and some wars happened anyway.” “You said you came back because terrorism threatened the future of this timeline.” Dad said slowly, as if he was thinking each word over carefully before speaking. How are you going to do something about that if you won’t let the government know about you?” “It’ll take time, and making sure I’m in the right position to advise the right people at the right time.” I answered. “I had decades of conversations with time traveler Davey, and with Sean as well. Before he had his stroke, Davey reached the conclusion that stopping a single event, or a series of events might change subsequent events, but they alone don’t change history for the better and usually the changes end up being for the worse.” “Why is that?” Mom asked. “Because you’re right in that our experiences, our memories make us who we are as time goes by.” I said. “If you stop too many of the horrors from happening, people forget about the dangers of certain things, and they get reckless. It’s like a kid who’s never been burned seeing a huge bonfire as a young adult and not realizing he can’t stick his hands in the fire without getting burned.” “I’m not sure I understand that.” Dad said and I let out a sigh. “It’s not easy to grasp right away.” I replied. “The fact is that the Challenger accident brought about much needed reforms. With Davey’s shortcut to helping stop it from happening, NASA didn’t learn the lessons it needed to learn and we ended up losing two more shuttles to accidents by the end of the 1990’s. In the end, what we theorized was that what needed to be changed weren’t specific events, but our understanding and learning from those events. In many ways, we need to have our bubble pricked and learn some hard lessons.” “Like what?” Dad asked. “Do you really want a deep political/philosophical discussion right now about international relations and the short-sightedness of our current social-economical system?” I asked while arching my eyebrow. “Not right now, no.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “Good, because I do have school in the morning.” I laughed. “Aren’t you finding school boring?” Mom asked me. “I mean, you’ve been through school already, and probably college, right?” “I’ve been through high school, college, law school, and gone back for two doctorates as well.” I answered and Dad snorted. “You went to law school?” Dad asked and I nodded while he shook his head. “Figures you wanted a lawyer to deal with Ellsworth and his daughter.” “God, I’d be bored if I had to go back through high school.” Davey muttered. “It’s not the most exciting thing in the world, except I do enjoy sports, and NJROTC, and all the other stuff that goes along with school.” I said with a shrug and Davey looked at me like I was crazy. “Besides, if I want to go to college again, I’ll need a high school diploma and they won’t just hand me one if I ask because I’m a time traveler.” “No, I guess they wouldn’t.” Mom said with a slight smile. For the next few hours, all three of them peppered me with questions about my life in the other timeline, and I could see the wariness and distrust fading from their eyes as I answered the questions. Several times my parents asked me questions that required answers slightly different than answers I’d previously given. It was obvious they were trying to delve into the truth of this situation as much as possible by trying to uncover any inconsistencies they could. What food remained uneaten had long since grown cold by the time dad yawned and stretched. “I think I’ve heard enough.” Dad said with a long look at Mom first and then at me. “At this point, I have to admit that as crazy as it sounds, I believe you. I’m still not sure how I feel about everything, but I’m ready to sleep on it.” “Thank you.” I said and stood up. “If you don’t mind, I’ll call it a night now. There’s school in the morning, and I have a test in English.” “I’ll be back in a minute to help clean everything up.” Davey said as he stood to follow me out. He led the way to my bedroom but stopped outside the door and looked at me with a slightly worried expression. “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “I’m wondering about you and me, and all this.” Davey said softly, looking into my eyes as if hunting for a lifeline. “I mean, I know you think we’re meant to be together, and it sounds like a dream come true. But I can’t help but feel it’s wrong.” “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “You, me, the whole sex thing.” He said softly. “I guess I can’t lie to you, you’re not the first guy I’ve had sex with, but I’ve always thought it was wrong; something not to be thought about, much less discussed. Until you, I didn’t even think it was possible to really feel love for another guy, I thought it was just about sex and girls were who you fell in love with.” “I know.” I said sympathetically and he smirked. “Of course you know, it’s me who doesn’t know.” He said softly. “I want it to be true, that you and I can live together and love each other, but I don’t know if I can.” “Take it one day, one moment at a time.” I suggested. “You came back twice and sought me out, and you were right to do that. The thing is, it was me who was where you were at right now, except I never really expressed it to him in words. Davey, the other you, the one with all those memories, he was so confident about us when I knew him. Still, he took his time with me, let me reach the decision that I loved him and wanted him, and he gave me time to work out my issues with the whole time travel crap.” “What did you do?” He asked. “It took me days to reach the decision you did earlier tonight.” I said with a shrug and he smiled. “I’ve always known you’re smarter than I am.” “No I’m not.” Davey demurred. “I wonder though, when you look at me, do you see me or do you see him? Do you love me because of him?” “You are him.” I asserted. “I said it earlier and I meant what I said. The only difference between you and the Davey I spent a lifetime with is that he had more memories than you do right now. As far as I can see, you are, at your core, the same person that he was, and it is those qualities that attract me to you, no matter what memories you do or do not possess.” “So you see both of us?” He asked and I couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s one thing I’ve always loved about you Davey Jones.” I said softly, reaching out and caressing his right arm. “You are quick on your feet and figure things out so much quicker than I ever could hope to do.” “Stop that.” He said with blushing cheeks and I leaned in to kiss him on the cheek. Davey pulled me into a hug before releasing me and turning to head back into the dining room. I got ready for bed, and although I should have been unable to sleep, as soon as I lay down on the bed, I was asleep. The next morning I woke up to icy water being dribbled on my face. Davey actually giggled as he scampered out of my room while I sat up in bed spluttering with indignation. The sun was barely touching the mountains in the east, but I found Davey in the kitchen wearing a sweat suit that mom had bought him the other day. It was really nice cotton pants in a dark blue and a gray hooded sweatshirt. “It’s about time you got up, old man.” He teased me and I realized I was in for a lot of payback for all the times I called him ‘old man’ in the last timeline. Still, the fact that he was taking it so well made me feel good inside. “I thought we’d just go for a run from here instead of going to the school.” “You’re really getting into this exercise stuff, aren’t you?” I asked him and he shrugged while blushing slightly over his orange juice. “I feel better after.” He said with another shrug. “Besides, it’s something we do that’s just the two of us. I like that.” “So do I.” I said warmly, getting my own glass of orange juice. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants that were a lighter blue than his, so after downing the juice, I went back to my room to finish getting dressed. We were now doing a good three miles on the morning runs, and at a decent pace without even having to stop for a walk. Davey was inordinately proud of that little fact, and when we got home to find Mom in the kitchen, he gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek before heading off to the shower, calling his dibs on first use of the bathroom. “He’s in a good mood.” Mom said after he’d left. There was a bit of tension in the air, and while I filled a glass of water, she gave me a long look before letting out a sigh. “You doing okay?” I asked her. “Yes, Brian, I am.” She answered. “I think I’m going to be okay with what you’ve told us. I look at you and you look no different, except for maybe the way you carry yourself. I hadn’t realized it before, but you’ve been a lot more confident without that arrogant pose I’d gotten used to seeing. You are different, but in all the important things I think you’re still my Brian.” “I’m glad to hear that, Mom.” I said earnestly. “How much does this change things?” She asked. “Do you expect to be treated like an adult now?” “Well, I am almost seventeen.” I replied with a smile and she chuckled. “In other words, I’m your son and I’ll always be your son. You’ll always be my mother, Dad will always be my father. Our relationship will change as the years go by, but no matter what else, I’m physically seventeen and I’m living under your roof.” “You had kids in that other timeline, right?” She asked even though we’d gone over that several times last night. “Yes, two boys.” I replied. “Do you think you’ll want kids in the future?” She asked me with a wistful look on her face. “I know you said people’s opinions on gays as parents change, but will you go through having kids again? It must have hurt a lot to leave them behind like that.” “I miss them a lot, but the truth is they were probably injured or killed when the dirty bomb went off.” I said with a slight shrug. “There wasn’t much time to think about that while Sean and I were getting ready to do our duty, but I’ve grieved over them the last couple of months here, and I’ve realized there wasn’t much I could do for them. As for kids in the future, more than likely we will, if Davey still wants them.” “Does he?” Mom asked. “Probably.” I said with a shrug. “Everything’s too new right now for us to have talked about it much.” “I guess so.” She replied and then got a worried look on her face. “Doesn’t the age difference bother you? Every time I think about it I get a little uncomfortable.” “I’m seventeen, mom.” I reminded her. “Sure I have more memories, but that doesn’t make it all that different. I remember being old, sure, but the body really does affect the brain as well as the brain affecting the body. I’m not in my eighties anymore, and I know that.” “Still, couldn’t you use your knowledge to influence him in a bad way?” Mom asked with a worried tone. “I could, but I won’t.” I said with a shrug. “In our relationship, I might have opened the door for him, but I didn’t trick him into walking through it, he did that on his own.” “I did what on my own?” Davey asked as he came into the room with his shaggy hair still wet, but he was wearing a newer pair of jeans and a sleeveless light blue OP shirt with a hood. The shirt showed off his much more slender body, and his arms that were starting to develop some good muscle. I had to turn away from Mom so she wouldn’t see the reaction, but a glance back showed her smothering a laugh. “Fall for this big guy here.” Mom said and Davey blushed while looking down at the table. “What will you boys have for breakfast?” “Cereal please.” Davey said and mom proceeded to get him a bowl. “I’ll have some too when I finish showering.” I said. “Davey, I hope you left me some hot water.” “Nope.” He said with a smarmy grin and I cuffed him up the side of the head before scooting out of the kitchen. Marcie wasn’t in school that day, to the relief of many, and it seemed that the furor over her paternity allegations was already dying down to be replaced by sniggers about her being a slut. I almost felt bad for her as I realized that she’d be shunned for the rest of her high school career, but in the end she’d deserved what she’d gotten. She’d gambled on her future and lost badly. As the days, and then the weeks progressed, things evened out and life became downright pleasant for the most part. Davey and I both took the ASVAB test in late March, just before spring break. Talk about ‘time travel’ became infrequent as he and my parents saw that I was much the same person they’d known and they grew accustomed to the concept that I just had a few extra memories rolling around in my head. Davey’s mother ended up having to go through detox after she recovered from her surgery because they’d given her too much morphine and she’d grown addicted to the stuff. Davey took his sister to visit her every weekend, and I even went with them a couple of time. Monta stayed up there, living in Uncle Rich’s old apartment and turning up her lip every time she saw a gay couple, but other than a few comments about Davey and I ‘being careful’ when we were up there, she didn’t say much. The biggest change was Dad’s business venture. They landed a few big clients right off the bat, and as a result he ended up being gone for most of each week, and even occasionally over the weekends. We all missed him, but Mom was especially lonely, and I wasn’t surprised when she ended up going to see him a couple of days a week. Most of the stuff she was doing was charity work, and she didn’t need to be in town all week. Davey and I didn’t mind since he liked to make love in all sorts of interesting places. That was one of the biggest differences for me to adjust to in this timeline. The Davey I’d known had been a passionate, skilled lover, but he’d been very discreet. Most of the time we’d made love it had been in a bed, behind closed doors and curtains. This Davey found the most amazing places to unbutton my pants, including in the mornings on the way to school, in the gym shower after baseball practice when he’d purposely delayed me so the rest of the team had already left, the backyard of the house after a friendly wrestling match, and along the canal bank during an early morning run. He wasn’t the only one doing the seducing though. I knew him very well, and I had to admit that a young sex drive, and having Davey in my reach again made me very horny. Barely an hour went by when I wasn’t thinking about the next time Davey and I would have sex, and I did my best to get him back for all the times he’d ambush me, pulling down my pants before I could protest. Davey got turned on by a lot of things, and chief among them were tight clothes. Whether it was me in my baseball uniform, or just wearing a particularly tight pair of jeans and a tight t-shirt, I could see his eyes glaze over whenever I wore something form-fitting. Male birds were often very colorful in order to attract a mate, and I knew that clothing always attracted Davey like few other things could. In the last timeline, when his family could afford nice clothes, I’d never quite understood why what I wore could have such an impact on his lust, but having seen the poor clothing that his family could afford in this timeline, I understood this aspect of him better. The Davey of that timeline had been a product of a rather poor family, and the effects of that had stayed with him from his original childhood. “I’m going to rip those pants off you later.” That was something I heard almost every day from Davey, usually as a hushed whisper as we walked from one class to the next, and every time I’d shiver in anticipation of that happening. Almost always he did manage to rip them off of me, and I knew better than to change out of whatever clothing had turned him on so much, rather waiting to let him peel them off of me. He enjoyed it nearly as much as I did. Dad joined us to go fishing with Pete during the middle of March on a Saturday. Davey was surprised at how good of an experience it was, with all of us catching several fish (including Davey actually catching his first one despite all the times he’d gone fishing with Pete as a kid). His grandfather seemed to have lightened up a bit, and barely even complained about paying off Davey’s car or continuing to make his car insurance payments. My relationship wasn’t just about sex with Davey, and although he usually went to his own room and slept in his own bed, we usually spent an hour or two in my room, just cuddling together on my bed while we talked quietly. He had a lot of questions, ranging from how to accept being gay and in a relationship to discussions about the last timeline, and what I had planned for this timeline. Most of the time he just listened, but as the days went by, he started proposing some of his own ideas, or critiquing mine in a way that showed me he really was thinking through my ideas, and that he was willing to be with me through the whole thing, taking an active part in what I hoped would be a productive change for the world. The Monday a week before the start of Spring Break, we all sat in the dining room after dinner for a talk about what we would do for the break. Normally my family went on a trip somewhere for a few days, and my parents would tell me where we were going at this time, having kept it as a surprise while they made their plans. “Boys, we’d planned for a trip to Los Angeles this year, including you, David.” Dad said when we were finished helping Mom with the dishes. “Unfortunately I have a business meeting next week that I have to attend so we’ve had to cancel our plans.” “I understand.” Davey said with a sigh. “Thanks for including me in the plans though.” “You’re as much a part of this family as Brian, David.” Mom said with a smile and a long look at him. He blushed but didn’t protest. “As for what we’re going to do next week, Dad’s having to travel for his meeting so we’re going with him for the entire week instead of just a couple of days. His work will pay for his airfare, and we’ve gotten a good deal for the rest of us and for our hotel rooms. You boys won’t mind sharing a room will you?” “No.” Davey said with another blush and she laughed. “Where are we going?” I asked. “Hawaii.” Dad said with a broad smile and my face lit up as did Davey’s. “Is this something to do with the Grayson merger?” Davey asked after we’d smiled at each other. Since he still did a bunch of typing for dad, it figures he’d have some idea what was going on in Dad’s business. “Yes.” Dad said and he had a proud smile on his face. I was pretty sure that Davey had been showing much more interest in dad’s work than I was, and Dad seemed to appreciate that. He and Davey had really bonded the longer that Davey stayed with us. “Would you like to come along to the meetings?” “I’d like that.” Davey said with a broad smile that my father returned. The last week of school before break flew by as we prepared for our trip. Davey blushed when we went to the sporting good store and I insisted that he buy a Speedo for the trip, but he did buy it, and he made sure that I bought one as well. Brandon, Trevor, and Todd (who was beginning to hang out with us more) were all jealous of our getting to go to Hawaii. Davey’s sister pouted for a day or two, but since she was going to Memphis with her friend’s family, she wasn’t too upset. The only real snag came up when Davey visited his mother the day before we were to leave. At first she said she wouldn’t let him go, but Monta stepped in and told her she was being selfish. Davey and I wisely left the hospital room while Monta proceeded to chew Sandy out about her trying to hold her son back from having fun just because she was stuck in the hospital. When we came back into the hospital room twenty minutes later, she grudgingly gave her permission for Davey to go. It had been a long flight to Hawaii, but Davey was full of energy and passion when we finally got checked into our hotel. Hawaii is three hours behind California in time, so it was late afternoon when we got there, and I spent the hours before dinner with Davey, breaking in our hotel room’s bed. I’d have to remember to leave a tip for the maids because our bed was a mess by the time we got dressed for dinner, and I was walking a little bit funny, hoping my parents would chalk it up to all the sitting during the long flight out here. On Monday while Davey went to some meeting with my father, I was dragged out for shopping with my mother. All things considered, there were worse ways to spend the day than shopping in Honolulu. I even managed to pick up another Speedo for Davey, pitch black with gray stripes, while mom arranged for surfing lessons that Davey and I could take the next couple of days. That meant we also had to get short wet suits for the surfing lesson, and my mouth watered at the thought of Davey wearing one of them. When he tried it on later that night in the hotel room, I hoped the maids cleaning our room were at least mollified by the large tip I’d leave them in the morning. Davey didn’t seem to mind, although he wasn’t quite sure about surfing. We spent Tuesday morning learning to surf before he returned to the hotel room to get dressed for a meeting that he was going to with Dad. During the lesson, I’d noticed one of the other guys that was learning to surf with us talking to Davey, and Davey flirting back a bit. That got me jealous, and Davey noticed the jealousy with a little smirk that oddly enough set me at ease. Davey turning down the guy’s suggestion of meeting up later in the week for some ‘practice’ made me feel even better. The week in Hawaii passed quickly for all of us, and I had to admit that I felt a lot more relaxed than I had been. School had been getting very hectic the last couple of weeks with mid-terms and preparing for the ASVAB. I also had a make-up testing of the SAT tests coming up in April, but during the trip I was able to not worry about that. Instead, I soaked up the sun with Davey, wiped out while trying to surf, went snorkeling in Hanama Bay, and we all went to a luau on Thursday night. Friday was our last full day since we were flying out early Saturday morning, and I’d talked my parents into letting Davey and I go off by ourselves. I didn’t tell Davey where we were going, and he watched me anxiously as we took a series of buses to get to our destination. It was still fairly early in the morning, just a little past nine, and we both wore shorts over our Speedos, and tight white t-shirts. We’d packed our snorkeling gear into two bags that we carried, and from that Davey had figured we were going to a beach, but hadn’t figured out anything else. When we got to the beach I’d picked out, I was glad to see that it was still fairly empty. Together we picked out a spot, put down our towels, took off our shorts, donned our snorkeling gear and headed out into the water. Davey was wearing the new black Speedo with gray stripes while I was wearing a red pair that I knew he really, really liked. There weren’t all that many schools of fish around where we snorkeled, and we ended up playing tag in the water, chasing each other over and under the waves tagging each other on the butt and then swimming off as we were chased. We did that for nearly two hours before we were both tired enough to head back up to the beach. It was nearing noon, and the beach was crowded with people as we waded back up out of the water, carrying our flippers in one hand and snorkel masks in the other. Davey stopped cold as he looked around at the crowded beach and turned to me with wide eyes. “This is why you picked this place.” He said with a little half-grin. “Yes.” I said, moving the mask to the hand with the flippers and reaching out to put my arm around him in public. He stiffened slightly at the touch, but relaxed against me a moment later and we walked back to our towels like that. As we walked there were many guys looking at us, some with lust in their eyes, some with sly smiles, and others with friendly looks on their face. Davey kept staring at them, and when we passed two guys that were so busy kissing each other that they didn’t see us go by, I could feel Davey’s body relax. When we laid down on our towels, dropping our gear, he scooted over so that he was firmly against my side and leaned in to kiss my ear. “I love you Brian.” Davey said softly and I looked up to see tears in his eyes as he looked at me before looking around. “I thought I was going to freak out the first time you and I walked around the Castro. Most of those were just too weird, but here, it’s no different than the other beaches we went to this week except it’s almost all guys.” “I thought you should see this before we go.” I said with a smile as I also looked around. “Do you think they’d freak out if we fucked right here?” Davey asked with a vivacious leer that caused a swelling in my Speedos. Instinctively I moved my hand to cover my crotch, but I decided to tease Davey instead and let him see the lump growing there. “They’d probably just take pictures or try to join in and then you’d be put in jail.” I said with a shrug. “But if you want, I won’t stop you.” “It’d suck going to jail for having sex with my boyfriend.” Davey joked. “Who said anything for going to jail over having public sex with me?” I joked back and he looked confused until I finished the statement. “You’d go to jail for starting a riot after I refused to let anyone but me touch you.” “Har har, very funny.” Davey said as he swatted my arm and laid back on his towel, stretching out to soak up some sun. I did the same, and felt a little thrill as his hand found mine and we entwined our fingers while soaking up the warm Hawaiian sun. Life was good, damn good. Chapter 13 “Guess whose moving back to town?” Todd asked as he spotted me while I did my presses. We were in my backyard. Davey’s mom had come home last week, and he was helping her get settled. Monta had come back with her after having been gone for nearly three months from her own home, and had thrown a fit at the condition of her house. Jenny was back from staying with her friend, and was resenting having to once again share a room with her mother. Sandy was doing much better, and the extra time in the hospital while she got over the morphine addiction had actually given her extra time for intensive physical therapy that had her on the verge of being ready to go back to work instead of having weeks more of physical therapy. “Who?” I asked Todd as I finished the set. Todd still came over two times a week to work out with us on the weight set, and was becoming a better friend with each passing week. “Sean Rule.” He said with a grin and I was glad I’d just put the weights back on their holder because I would have dropped them otherwise. “You’re kidding; I thought he and his family lived down south.” I said, trying not to show exactly how excited I was by the news. “Yeah, well I just heard they’re moving back here over the summer.” Todd said. “I remember what you said about wanting to apologize to him for what you did back in freshman year, and now you’re going to get your chance. Don’t worry, I’ll put in a good word for you beforehand.” “Thanks.” I said sardonically. “Okay, let’s get these set up for me.” Todd said, changing the subject. “I’m not a big fucking ape like you and Davey.” “Well at least you’re no longer a pee-wee.” I said as I stood up and wrapped my hand around his biceps. He was definitely more toned there. “Hey, hands off the merchandise or I’ll tell my best friend you’re playing around on him.” Todd teased, having already figured out Davey and I, of course his catching us making out one day in the garage helped him put two and two together. “You’re just jealous.” I teased him back as we took off some of the weights for him to do his own set. “Damn right I’m jealous, I should have had Davey.” Todd smirked. There was just enough bitterness in his voice that I knew he was partially serious, but the look in his eyes also told me that he was resigned to the fact that Davey was mine. That was a good thing, Todd was a good guy and I’d hate to have to set him straight on how things stood. “Who wouldn’t be?” I said instead of something harsher and he chuckled before lying back on the bench and getting ready for his sets. Forty minutes later he was driving off in his beetle and I took my third shower of the day to clean off the sweat from our workout. Davey came home after dinner, and one look at his face had me worried. His eyes were red and puffy. “What’s wrong, honey?” Mom asked as soon as she saw him enter the living room where we were watching television with Dad who’d actually gotten home earlier than normal. “I… it’s my mom.” Davey stammered and mom was up off the couch and hugging him before guiding him over to sit next to me. His hand found mine and clasped it tightly. “What’s wrong?” Dad asked. “I thought she was home from the hospital?” “She is.” Davey sniffed, barely holding back the tears. “That’s what’s wrong.” “What do you mean?” Mom asked while putting a hand on his shoulder. “She… she’s already got a job lined up for as soon as the doctor clears her for work.” Davey sniffed again. “She’ll start in a couple of weeks and as soon as she does, she wants to move out of Nanny’s.” “Shouldn’t that be a good thing?” I asked with a frown. “It is.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “The only problem is that she wants me to move back in with her.” “Dear, she’s your mother; of course she wants her children home with her.” Mom said gently and Davey shook his head. “That’s the thing, she’s not sure where we’re going to move.” Davey moaned softly. “Jenny wants to stay at Ceres High, that’s where all her friends are, and if mom gets a place in Ceres, that means I have to go to Ceres as well and I don’t want to go to that stupid school. Mom’s considering moving into a place in Downey’s district, but Jenny’s dead-set against it and I can’t make mom choose me over Jenny. It wouldn’t be right, I mean my sister’s been through so much – more than me – and she deserves to go to the school where her friends are.” “So do you.” I said with a firm clasp of his hand in mine and he sighed. “It wouldn’t matter anyway, because if she moved into Downey’s district it would be more expensive than the housing in Ceres.” Davey said with a sigh. “Either way, she won’t make enough money on her own, and Dad’s barely making enough to pay Grandma Jones the rent she charges him for staying with her. That means I’ll have to get a real job.” “You already do work for me, that is a real job.” Dad said and Davey let out a bark of laughter. “I’m sorry, Dad B.” Davey said. He’d started calling Dad that after the Hawaii trip and my father still smiled every time he heard Davey say it, even now. “I don’t mean that it’s not a real job just that I don’t make as much money doing it like I did at McDonald’s. Sure, I make more per hour, but I had a lot more hours and Mom will need that money to make rent and pay for food and all that.” “What about your after-school activities and the stuff we’ve already planned for the summer?” I asked him and he frowned. “I’m sorry, Brian, but I’m just not going to be able to do all that.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and a shake of his head. “Mom needs the extra money and I need to help her and Jenny first, before anything else. It just wouldn’t be right for me to do otherwise.” “What about college, David?” Dad asked while I contemplated Davey. His mouth was set in a determined way that I knew all too well. He’d made up his mind, and right now there would be no moving him. He did grimace at dad’s question though. “I can go to MJC part-time after I finish high school next year.” Davey said after a moment of thinking. He looked over at me sympathetically. “I know you wanted me to go to school with you, Brian, but you understand, don’t you? After Jenny graduates, mom won’t need my help anymore and then I can go meet you wherever you’re going to school. Credits from MJC will transfer, right?” “Yes, they will.” I said with a sigh. “Are you sure about this? Davey I know you want to help them but is it worth the cost to yourself?” “Of course it is.” Davey snorted indignantly. “If that’s your decision, that’s your decision.” Dad said with a note of finality. “We’re going to miss having you around here, son.” “I’ll still be around.” Davey said with a sad smile. “I mean, it’s not like I’m breaking up with Brian, and I really do appreciate everything you have all done for me so I’ll be here whenever I can get away.” “You’re at least going to finish the year at Downey, right?” Mom asked. “Yeah, and if we’re lucky, Mom will pick the place in Modesto so I can still go there.” Davey said with a little smile. “We can always continue using Nanny’s address for Jenny so she can go to Ceres, and either Mom or I can take her there in the mornings.” “That would be good.” I said and squeezed Davey’s hand again. “I’ve got some homework to do now if you don’t mind.” Davey said as he stood up. Both Mom and Dad gave him a hug before he went into his bedroom and I was left in the living room with my parents. “What do you think, Brian?” Dad asked me softly when Davey was gone to his bedroom. “He’s set on doing this.” I said with a shrug. “He obviously doesn’t like it, but he thinks it is the right thing to do, and he’ll do anything for his mother and sister.” “Even after what his mother did when she brought him back to California?” Mom asked. I’d told her that part of the story and she’d been furious for most of that night. “Even after that.” I answered her question. “Davey’s very forgiving when it comes to those he loves. You know he went to talk to his father last week, right?” “He didn’t tell us that.” Dad said with surprise. “What happened?” “His father was trying to make a go at selling medical equipment but the company folded.” I explained. “The man’s desperate for a job, and he asked Davey’s help in getting a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres.” “Ouch.” Dad winced. “That must be hard for both of them.” “Yeah, well Davey did it.” I said with a shake of my head. “His dad’s going to be hired at the Ceres restaurant and is being trained to be an Assistant Manager there.” “I hope that works out for him.” Mom said. “So what do we do about this?” Dad asked. “You know him better than us.” “Right now there’s not much we can do.” I said with a shrug. “Except be there for him when he needs support, and make sure that he knows we care about him. He has to make his own decisions and he’ll resist any effort to persuade him differently as long as his mother keeps pushing this.” “We can talk to her, then.” Mom said with a determined look. “She has to see this is not what’s best for Davey.” “She’s even more stubborn than Davey.” I said with a short laugh. “So we’ll just have to wait and see, and be there for David if he needs us.” Dad said and I looked at him with a question in my eyes that he understood. “Brian, I told you once that we felt sorry for him with the bad luck he’s had in life. Since we’ve gotten to know him, both your mother and I have found that we love him like he’s our second son.” “Thanks, dad.” I said with affection. Davey was edgy around me all that night and the next morning, not quite sure about how I would take his decision. I may not have been happy about it, but I knew better than to try to force him to change his mind. Plans could be changed, and nothing about his decision would make my long-range plans untenable, it would just delay them a few years. When he finally realized that I wasn’t going to argue with him about his decisions, he warmed up a little. That afternoon he went with his mother and sister to look at possible places for them to move. His mother wasn’t quite able to drive yet, so he took them in his car. I spent the time doing homework and some chores around the house. Dad got back just after six that night and we sat down for a quiet dinner with just the three of us. We were just finishing when there was a loud knock on the door, and I got up to answer it. “Your parents home, Brian?” Pete Barrow asked with a frown as I opened the door. “We’re just finishing up dinner, Mr. Barrow.” I answered in surprise and he grunted. “Good, I’d like to talk to them, and you I guess.” He said grumpily. “Come in, please.” I replied standing aside and feeling a little glimmer of amusement. Pete was probably as unhappy about things with Davey as we were, and I had a good idea that he was here to try to enlist our aid in changing Davey’s mind, or his mother’s, or both of them. “Pete, what a surprise!” My mom said with delight as we entered the dining room. She got up and gave him a hug as well as a kiss on the cheek. Pete’s face softened at that and he was almost smiling as he turned to shake hands with my father. “It’s nice to see you Brenda.” Pete said and he gave both of my parents a sharp look. “I’d like to talk to you both, and Brian too, if you don’t mind. It’s about Davey and that damn fool of a daughter of mine.” “We’d be happy to talk with you.” Dad said with a smile. “Can I get you anything?” Mom asked. “Coffee, if you have some made.” Pete replied. “I was actually getting ready to make some.” Mom said with a smile. “Why don’t I go ahead and get it started?” “That’ll be fine if it’s no trouble.” Pete replied with a twinkle in his eye. He turned back to my father and a scowl flittered across his face. “I take it Davey’s told you about his mother’s fool idea?” “Yes, he has.” Dad said as Mom went into the kitchen. “I’ve done tried to talk sense into the two of them.” Pete grumped. “They’re both as stubborn as Monta, though.” “Coffee will be ready in just a minute, Pete.” Mom said as he came back into the room and we all sat down at the table. “Thanks, Brenda.” Pete said with a nod. “I don’t see what we can do, but we’ll do anything we can to help David.” Dad said to Pete. “He’s a good young man with a bright future.” “He is that.” Pete agreed. “The problem here is that Sandy and Monta are thinking about what’s best for Sandy and Jenny. That girl is starting to go a bit wild and needs more attention from her mother. What they aren’t doing is thinking about what’s best for Davey. If they did they wouldn’t be trying to drag him back and forcing him to give up his future so that Sandy can feel like she’s got her family again.” “Part of the problem is David’s willingness to put off his future for them as well.” Mom said quietly before getting up to go into the kitchen and prepare the coffee. No one said anything until she came back with a tray of coffee and cups for everyone. “That boy is frustrating sometimes.” Pete said with an explosive exhalation. “He goes and gets his back up when anyone criticizes his father and runs off in a temper, but then the moment Monta or Sandy ask him to do something for them he falls all over himself doing it, no matter what it costs him.” “So the key here is getting Monta and Sandy to change their minds?” Dad asked. “Yes, and that’s what makes it so hard.” Pete explained. “They get a fool idea in their head and they go with it without thinking things through.” “Do you have any ideas on how to change their minds?” Mom asked and Pete shrugged. “We just have to make them see what this’ll cost Davey and make them believe it’s not worth the cost.” Pete shrugged. For the next hour we discussed a few ideas, and it was decided that they’d be tried out when we went over to Pete’s house for dinner later in the week. He’d suggested that Monta should fix us a dinner as a ‘thank you’ for all the help we’d given them, and afterwards Pete would start up a conversation that we all hoped might change their minds. Pete left looking a little less dour than when he’d arrived, and Davey called to say that he’d be staying there in Ceres for the night. I managed to get Davey to go with me to lunch the next day at school. He’d been acting a bit sheepish all day, as if he expected me to be angry, but relaxed as we sat down in the diner we’d driven to in my car. As the waitress brought our plates and we dug in, he lowered his guard. “Did you find a good place yesterday?” I asked as he took a bite of his sandwich. He frowned as he chewed and then swallowed. “Yeah, but the one we can afford best is in Ceres.” He said with a shrug. “It’s only two bedrooms, but it’s affordable. I’d have liked the one in Modesto, but it was just too expensive.” “Even with you working?” I asked him, trying not to show my true feelings about all this. “It sucks, but it’s for the best.” Davey said with a sigh. “Mom wants us all together again, and she’s got a point. We might have been able to afford the bigger place in Modesto, but Janice won’t hire me back.” “Why not?” I asked while frowning at the bitterness in his voice. “I thought they really needed people?” “They did, but after I left she hired two people to replace me and the other restaurant hired someone else as well so they don’t need me to fill in there either.” Davey’s voice was sour, but I tried not to show my smile. “It took them hiring two people to replace you?” I asked him while letting my smile show slightly, hoping he’d not think I was happy he’d not been hired back. “Yeah, well, and then I’d asked her a week ago to help my dad get a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres and they hired him so there’s no job for me there.” Davey grumped, but he did smile a bit at the compliment. “What are you going to do now?” I asked him as I took a bite of my salad. “I heard the Burger King in Ceres was hiring.” He said with a shrug. “Janice said she’d give me a good recommendation.” “Have you thought about doing something besides fast food?” I asked him. “You’ve been doing office work for dad, right?” “Uh huh, but it’s hard to find that kind of job while going to school.” Davey answered with another frown. “We’ll think of something.” I said confidently and the smile came back to his face. “I know you’re probably upset that I’m turning my back on you and your folks after all you’ve done for me.” Davey said a few minutes later after we were mostly done with our food. The waitress refilled our glasses of water while I shook my head. “You’re not turning your back on us.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “They are your family so I understand.” “You sure?” Davey asked and I smiled. “The question is are you sure?” I asked and he frowned at me while sighing and leaning back in the booth. “I’m sure.” Davey said with false bravado in his voice, and under my stare he quickly deflated, sagging against the back of the booth on his side. “Damn it, you know, don’t you? It’s tearing me up inside and I hate this.” “I’m sorry.” I said as I chuckled. The situation was funny, in a way. “What are you laughing at?” He asked sourly. “Sorry, it’s just that it’s weird being on this side of the conversation.” I said and he squinted at me with his blue eyes for a moment. “What do you mean?” He asked. “Let’s just say I remember spending a few decades with a man who knew me at times better than I did.” I said with a shrug. “He knew me from so many other lifetimes that at times it was like I couldn’t fool him no matter how hard I tried.” “Now you know me that way.” Davey said with a slow smile. “Well, yes and no.” I admitted with a shrug. “What do you mean?” Davey asked. “Well, the Davey I knew, he had all the experiences you’ve had, but he’d lived a hundred years since the first time he was seventeen.” I explained. “I knew the person he’d become through all the experiences you’re going through now, and well, you’re already a little different than he was.” “How’s that?” Davey frowned. “Well, by this time, that Davey had already been kicked out of Downey.” I answered softly and almost winced at the frown on his face and the way a little line furrowed between his eyebrows. “Why was I, him, kicked out?” Davey asked. “Because he kept missing classes to work two jobs.” I answered. “He just quit going altogether when he got a promotion at that McDonald’s, and they kicked him out. I remember how embarrassed he was to tell me that they’d transferred his enrollment to a continuation school and he didn’t even know about it until he showed up at school one day after not going for three weeks.” “That must have sucked.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Why’d he do that?” “Because his, your, mother and sister needed the money.” I said with a shrug. “What are you trying to say?” He said with an accusatory tone. “You trying to say I’m about to make the same mistake he did?” “No, I’m just telling you what I know happened.” I replied calmly. Davey upset, as he was now, had to be handled carefully or he’d push back hard. “You are your own person, and your life is already different than his. I don’t know for sure what will happen if you do what you’re talking about now. Davey, remember, this timeline is different than the one I knew, and it’s different already than the one that Davey told me about. Every day we live is part of a new timeline, and I don’t know what’s going to happen with you and me. I know what I want to happen, not what will.” “Why is it always about what other people want from me?” Davey snorted with a look of angst on his face. “What is it you want?” “I want to live my life with you.” I said simply with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “I want to grow old with you, be a part of your life and have me always be a part of yours.” “What if I don’t want that?” He asked and for a moment my heart stopped at the thought. The first few thoughts that came to my head I quickly bit back, and took a deep breath. Davey was watching me closely, and I knew this was an important moment. “Then I’ll have to respect your wishes no matter how much I don’t like it.” I said slowly and he narrowed his eyes. “You won’t try to convince me otherwise?” He said disbelievingly as I snorted. “Of course I will!” I snapped with a bit of irritation. “I’ll make damn sure you know what you’re giving up if you choose to walk away from me, from us, but it’s your damn choice to make no matter what I think about it.” “But don’t you have a say in… this?” He asked me and I looked at him with confusion for a moment before I realized what he was asking. “I made that choice a long time ago from my perspective, Davey Jones.” I told him. “In all those years, I’ve never regretted my choice to live my life with you, either the you I knew before or the you I’m getting to know now.” “I don’t understand it.” Davey admitted softly. “How two men can love each other the way you obviously love me, or him, or both of us, I don’t understand.” “You will.” I assured him and he smiled softly for a moment. “It scares me that I believe you when you say stuff like that, and for a moment I think I can be happy like this, living with another guy.” He said with a heavy sigh. “Then that other voice comes back, and it tells me I’m sinning and I’m going to hell unless I repent, and I think about what happens when Mom, or Dad, or god forbid, Nanny and Papa find out.” “They’ll go berserk at first, but eventually they’ll realize they love you.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “You’ll have fights with them, and then they’ll come around, telling you that they love you no matter what. At first they’ll be standoffish, and then they’ll gradually become more and more accepting until they accept me just as they would have if I was a woman you’d married that they didn’t quite approve of, but that made you happy.” “Like a catholic?” Davey snorted and I laughed. He looked at his watch and frowned. “We better get going. We’re almost late for class.” After school he left to go out with his mother and sister. It was fairly apparent his mother had decided on the Ceres location, and that they were going to do the last bit of paperwork for that. I had a few hours after school, and some time to myself to really think about this, and to make some decisions. When Mom and Dad were both home, I had a long conversation with them and presented my ideas. The timing of everything was fortuitous, and as we drove to Ceres, we made the stop at the convenience store on Yosemite Boulevard. “You sure about this?” Mom asked as she put the little slip of paper in the card we had gotten for Davey’s mother. “Yes.” I assured her. “Aren’t you meddling?” Dad asked as we pulled back onto the road. The airport looked odd without the corporate jet hangars, I noticed with a small corner of my brain. “How does this affect the timeline and your plans?” “It helps Davey, that’s what’s important.” I said firmly. “It keeps things on track with my plans.” “But, how do you know his mother will make the right choices?” Mom asked. “That’s where you come in.” I said firmly. “She needs friends, Mom. You and her got along real well in the last timeline. There’s no reason you shouldn’t get along in this one. You worked for her for a long while there.” “I did?” Mom asked with a frown. “Yes, and you both made a lot of money.” I said with a slight smile. “Mom, she’s been a pastor’s wife since she was out of high school. Along the way she’s held a lot of other jobs, but she was always the wife of a preacher. That made her isolated in a way, from other women her age. I remember Davey talking about how happy he was to see her with so many friends her own age in the last timeline. In a way, that kind of describes his parents. Both of them lived lives that were filled with other people, but they were isolated in one way or another for the most part, at least until the last timeline.” “For some reason that makes some sense.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You both have friends that you do things with all the time.” I pointed out to them. “There are the Rushes, the Walkers, the Bettencourts, and a few others. All friends you’ve had for years and years.” “Speaking of them, what’s going on between Brandon, Trevor, and you?” Mom asked with a little frown as we entered Ceres proper. How many times had I driven this route with Davey in the last time as we visited his mother’s parents, and his father’s mother? The two sets of family literally lived ‘right around the corner’ from each other. Most people would consider it a blessing to have grandparents so close to each other, but I knew from a lifetime of experience that it was both a blessing and a curse. Then again, we’d followed a similar example buying both our Washington and our Modesto homes so close to his and my parents’ homes. My how the boys had loved that, trudging from house to house to get Christmas presents and candy from their different sets of grandparents. It was amazing how spoiled they had been, and yet turned out to be such fine young men. “Brian?” Mom’s voice was concerned as she looked at me in the back seat of the car. “Are you okay? You look like you’re about to cry.” “I was just remembering something about… about the boys.” I murmured softly and she frowned softly, but there was sympathy in her eyes. “How do you deal with that?” She asked me. “I would die if I lost you because I…” “I didn’t lose them.” I said vehemently. “They might be born again in this timeline, but they at least lived long, full lives in the last one.” “But it still hurts.” Mom stated and I nodded. “About Trevor and Brandon.” I said, picking up her question. “They’re just being… teenagers. Don’t worry, it’ll take a little time, but we’ll be back to being friends the way we’ve always been.” “That’s good to hear.” Dad said firmly as we pulled onto Myrtlewood and approached Pete and Monta’s house. Monta answered the door, and we were welcomed inside. Shantill was there, with her infant daughter, as were Davey’s mother, his sister, and one of Jenny’s friends. The house was crowded with all these people, and I couldn’t blame Sandy for wanting to move out. “My, you’re as big as Davey.” Monta said with a bright smile as she tried to push some Kool-Aid into my hand. I took it with a smile. “Thank you, ma’am.” I said with a smile. “Where is he?” “Oh, he got called for a job interview!” Monta said with a smile. “He did?” My voice almost cracked at that, and I noticed how Dad’s face flickered into a frown. Unfortunately, so did Davey’s mom and she frowned as well. There was no doubt in my mind they were frowning for different reasons though. “Yes he did!” Monta said, totally oblivious to the undercurrents in the kitchen and dining room area of her home. Pete was standing in the doorway that separated the area from the living room, and he was frowning as well. “Monta talked to her old shift supervisor at the cannery.” Pete grumbled with an intense look at dad. “She thinks he can get an evening and weekend shift there.” “They pay good, and he can work more during the summer.” Davey’s mother said with a defensive tone. “That was very nice of you to get him an interview.” Dad said to Monta who practically beamed. “Well, he’s a good boy.” She said. “He’s always doing his best for his mother and sister.” “It smells so good in here.” Mom said to change the subject, and Monta went on to tell Mom what she was cooking. “Davey will like going to Ceres next year.” Jenny said as I moved into the family room. It had once been the garage, but Pete had converted it into a huge family room years ago. I noticed Davey’s bed off in the corner and tried not to frown at the idea of him having to sleep down there. “Really?” I said, not quite sure what to make of her tone. This young teenager was nothing like the Jenny Jones I had known in the last timeline. She was an odd mix of adult and childish behaviors. One moment she would be more mature than her age, and then the next a spoiled brat. The Jenny I had known had always been supremely confident, gregarious, and an overall joy to be around. This Jenny would be similar, and then go into a pout, or a fit of rage that I wasn’t sure how to deal with. Tonight she seemed, edgy, almost jealous in a way. “Yeah, so you probably won’t be seeing as much of him.” She said. “That won’t change us being friends.” I said calmly. She frowned and walked away, taking her friend Stacey with her. That was a bit of a relief because Stacey was giving me an all too familiar look through her eyelashes. “Do you know my brother, Christopher?” Shantill asked me as she came into the family room, having left her daughter in Pete’s arms. “He went to Downey didn’t he?” I asked and she smiled with a look very similar to the one Stacey had been giving me. Since I remembered having to dodge roving hands from another Shantill, I made sure to leave as much distance as possible. Luckily, I was saved by Mom calling me to help set the table for Monta. Dinner was nice, even with the undercurrents running through the room. For some reason, it seemed Jenny was jealous of me for the amount of time Davey spent at our house. Stacey and Shantill took turns trying to pass me more food while giving each other murderous looks, and Davey’s mother kept giving my mother and father defensive looks as if she was worried about them looking down on her. “I’m home.” Davey’s voice called out when dinner was almost over, and there was a flurry of activity as Monta got up and set an extra place at the table for him, putting him next to me. “Well, what did he say?” His mother asked after he’d gotten settled. “I’ve got a job starting in two weeks, if school will approve the work permit.” Davey said with a shrug. Monta cheered, as did Jenny and his mother. “Congratulations, Davey.” Dad said after his immediate family had gotten done doing the same thing. “Thanks, Mr. B.” Davey said with a slight smile. “Why does the school have to approve you working there?” His sister asked after a few minutes. “It’s all the heavy machinery.” Davey said with a shrug. “Normally you can’t work there until you’re eighteen, but, well, because of Nanny having worked there, they’ll risk hiring me. I’ll talk the school counselor into it, don’t worry. They pay almost eight dollars an hour! That’s over twice minimum wage. I can get about four hours a night during the week, and then a full day on Saturday and Sunday.” “You’ll have a couple days off a week, won’t you?” Mom asked with a frown. “Um, well, I’ll need all the hours I can get.” Davey said. “I’m sure I’ll get a day or two off every couple of weeks.” “Yes, well, don’t wear yourself out.” Pete said, making a point to draw attention to his left hand. It was missing the two middle fingers. He’d lost them in an accident at a job site when he’d made a stupid mistake because he was working too long and had gotten too tired. “That heavy machinery will suck in a hand, or your arm and chop it right off without a second thought.” “I know, Papa.” Davey said in a long drawl, but there was a look in the back of his eyes that said Pete’s warning had reminded him that bad things could happen. When everyone had finished dinner, we moved into the family room. Monta served coffee for herself, Pete, and Dad. Mom and Davey’s mom were drinking hot tea while Davey and I were having water. Jenny had gone to her friend’s house, and Shantill was on the phone with one of her male friends. The conversation had started casually, with Sandy talking about the house in Ceres that they had applied for earlier that day. “Oh my, it’s time for the drawing!” Monta exclaimed when she noticed the time. She got up and went over to the big screen television, turning it on and changing the channel. “I swear you waste more money on that than I care to imagine!” Pete grumbled before turning to my father. “Both her and Sandy like to play that Lotto junk!” “That reminds me!” Mom said with a slight smile as she dug into her purse. She took out the card we’d signed earlier and that she’d sealed in the car. “Sandy, we are so glad you’re feeling better. We got you this card.” “Thank you, Brenda.” Sandy said with a smile as she opened the envelop just as the lottery drawing came on television. She opened the card as the third ball popped up and the number was called. A slip of paper fell out of the opened card and she bent to pick it up. “A lottery ticket!” “Yes, Davey mentioned how you like to play.” Mom said with a disingenuous smile while Davey gave me a suddenly suspicious look while the fourth ball popped up with its number. “Would you look at that, it’s got all four numbers!” Sandy exclaimed, suddenly on the edge of her seat and looking between the ticket and the television with excitement. “I’ve got none!” Monta called out as she came flying out of her Lazyboy chair to look over Sandy’s shoulder at the lottery ticket. When the fifth number appeared, she started jumping up and down. “That’s five!” “Oh my.” Sandy Jones said softly as the final number appeared on the screen, just as I remembered from another timeline. Sandy and my mother had both bought tickets to that drawing, and I’d joined that timeline’s Davey in teasing them after they’d lost. This time though, Sandy Jones had just won nine million dollars, and was screaming her head off while her son gave me a look filled with suspicion. Chapter 14 “Why’d you do it?” Davey asked me yet again as we stood looking out the window of his bedroom. Below us, his sister and her two friends were hanging over the railing of the back porch, looking at the river churning in the small canyon below. The room was empty, because we were officially just ‘looking’ at the place while his mother contemplated buying the house with her new wealth. “Davey…” I started to say but he shook his head and looked at me with sad eyes. He’d barely spoken to me for the last three weeks, and part of me couldn’t blame him too much for that. “No, Brian.” He said softly. “You didn’t even ask me what I thought. You just did it. What about those people that won the lottery the week after? We took money from them. They were supposed to win all of what Mom got.” “They still won three million.” I said with a sigh. “That’s still a lot of damn money.” “But it’s wrong that you took it away from them and gave it to my mom.” Davey said again, repeating the same thing he’d said last time. “Things would have worked out, you know. I had that job at the cannery and now Mom won’t even let me think about working. She wants me to study and do sports and all that stuff. That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” I answered honestly and he frowned, not expecting me to be so blunt. “That is exactly what I wanted, Davey Jones. I wanted you to be able to concentrate on school, on learning the things to get into a good school where you’ll study the things you need – that we need for the future.” “You did it so I could follow the damn path you’ve laid out for me in your head.” Davey snarled with a look of anger. “I thought you wanted to help me, to help make things better in this world.” I said softly and he frowned. “I do, but I don’t want to cheat in order to do it.” He said in a much softer tone. “Davey, I learned a lot of things in my last life.” I said gently, catching his blue eyes in mine and holding them. It struck me again how his eyes were blue, like mine, but a different shade, and they practically glittered with his emotions at this age in a way that they almost never did in the last timeline. There was still true innocence there, innocence long since gone by the time I’d ever met him. “One of the things I’ve learned is that sometimes you have to take what you need, even if it causes some harm to others. In this case, yes, what I did took money from people who would have gotten more otherwise. Still, they won, and they won a decent amount. Maybe they won’t be able to waste as much of it as they did in the last timeline, but they still got a lot of money. What your family got from it is going to be used to do a lot more than they ever would have done. With it, we’re going to change the world, make it a better place.” “But how does that justify it?” Davey asked. “How can we say we’re good people if we stole that money?” “Davey, I remember the numbers for four lottery drawings in my life.” I said after taking a deep breath. It was time for him to hear this part of my plan. “In five more years, there’s going to be a drawing worth over twenty times what your mother won. We’re going to win that one too.” “Why?” He asked with narrowed eyes and suspicion in his tone. “Because the world doesn’t run on good intentions.” I said with a hint of bitterness in my voice as I looked out the window again. It was strange, I’d had nothing to do with picking this house, but like in the last timeline, Pete had picked it out for Sandy, and she had fallen in love with it at first sight. I was certain she’d buy it, and it was in the Downey district. Even Jenny wasn’t complaining about having to leave Ceres, although she was talking about getting a transfer to let her stay in Ceres High, which was almost certain. She’d have a license soon, and her mother now had plenty of money to get her a car of her own. “What do you mean?” Davey asked me and I sighed. “In the last timeline, your father ran for President, twice, and he won both times.” I said softly and he made a snort. “Yeah, you told me about that.” He said with a hint of scorn. “It won’t happen this time, though. No one is going to vote for a convicted child molester.” “No, you’re right, it won’t happen, but that’s not my point.” I said patiently. “How much do you think he spent on those two campaigns?” “A lot.” Davey said quietly. “Millions of dollars, probably.” “The two campaigns totaled over five hundred million dollars.” I told him and looked back to see his eyes widening and he made a slight coughing noise. “Yeah, your father had to raise half a billion dollars to get, and keep the Presidency. All of his campaigns in total probably came to nearly a billion dollars. Think about that Davey. In the decades after his Presidency, he was widely acknowledged as one of the best presidents in our country’s history. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, not once, not twice, but four times. His acts as President, and later, changed the course of history for this country, and our world. I remember our grandchildren coming home from school, laughing and reading the entry on him from their history books.” “That’s still hard to believe.” Davey said with a whisper and wet eyes. “I can’t believe my father would be so… good.” “But he didn’t become President because he was a good man.” I pushed on. “Sure, that’s part of what got him in office, and made him the great President he was, but this world is as full of good men like your father as it is full of bad, stupid men. Without having the ability to raise that billion dollars for his campaigns, your father might have never been more than a preacher, or a truck driver. In order to change the world, he had to have money to do it. Think about it though, because he took a billion dollars people gave to him, and because of his policies, billions of people lived better lives, and many made more money than they would have otherwise. That billion spent on him yielded results that can never be measured.” “Does it matter?” Davey asked bitterly. “That’s all gone now, destroyed by your time traveling.” “Yes, it does matter.” I said with a sigh. “You may not remember them, no one may remember all those people, but it doesn’t change the fact that they existed or that they had better lives.” “What you’re saying is that it takes money to make things change, to make the world a better place like you want to do, and we have to have that money.” Davey summarized and I smiled while nodding my agreement. “Nine million paid out over twenty years won’t do all that much.” Davey said softly. “No, but a couple hundred million, well around a hundred million after taxes and all that will be enough seed money to make a start.” I said and he nodded. “There are other things, like certain timely investments, that will take that money and turn it into something close to what your father raised for his campaigns.” “So in order to do the good you want to do, we have to take money from others.” Davey said succinctly. “What do most people do when they win the lottery?” “Pay off their bills, quit their jobs, and spend it on themselves or their family, maybe some family friends.” I said with a shrug. “We’re going to do more than that though. You and I, if you want, we will change this world like your father did, although I hope to make it last longer than he did.” “How did he fail to do that?” Davey asked and I smiled. “Cult of personality.” I answered and he frowned. “Huh?” He stated. “It’s something I first learned in college.” I said with a shrug. “Okay, maybe I heard Davey and his father talking about it in high school, but they were discussing Ronald Reagan. But, when I learned it in college was when Davey and I first really started discussing it in the context of our national political history.” “So you’re saying I need to go to school to learn about this?” Davey asked with a slight chuckle. “Yes.” I answered him honestly and he nodded. “I still don’t like it.” He sighed. “You don’t have to like it.” I said with a shrug. “Most of the time I don’t like it either, taking money from people like this, but it is necessary.” “How did you get so… jaded?” Davey asked and I had to laugh. “I’m not jaded compared to some people.” I shrugged and he gave me that look that I now knew to mean he was thinking about time travel. “How did I get so jaded?” He asked softly. “You already know the answer to that.” I replied and he stared at me for a long moment before nodding slowly. “Oh, good, you’re both up here.” Sandy Jones said from the doorway to Davey’s room. My mother was right behind her, and both of them were smiling. “What do you think, Davey? Is this place good enough?” “I love it Mom.” Davey said with a gentle smile. “It’s like we were meant to live here.” That bastard! He said that on purpose, since I’d already told him the history of the house in the last timeline. It was all I could do to not burst out in laughter. “What do you think Brian?” She asked and I had to take a deep breath before answering. “I like it a lot.” I answered her. “Good, then I’ll let Dad haggle with the realtor and get the price down a bit.” She said before turning and walking away with a determined stride. “She’s happy.” Davey smiled softly. “No matter what else, this is making her happy, and your mother… why did they turn down half the money?” “We don’t need millions of dollars.” I said with a shrug. “Besides, our moms are talking about going into business together and your mom is providing most of the start-up funds for that.” “True.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “If I didn’t believe you already, I’d believe you came from the future now. Wait, I just thought of something. You said the timeline was already changing. Aren’t you worried the cumulative effects of the changes you’re making will change the lottery numbers of that big jackpot you want to win?” “Nope.” I answered confidently. “Why not?” He asked. “I don’t understand the physics myself, and I know you’re not much on the mathematics.” I semi-answered and he frowned, but didn’t protest. It was true, even after a hundred years of life, Davey was mediocre at best with math. “What it comes down to is that changes can effect the world in a lot of ways, but certain events are largely unchanged unless there’s something really massive that happens. Random events, like the random drawing of the lottery numbers stays random. If you want to change them, your best bet would be to change things so the lottery is outlawed and the drawing never held, for example.” “Or start World War Three and get everything nuked.” Davey said with a slow nod of his head and I nodded my agreement. “Yep, like that.” I agreed. “In some weird way it makes sense.” Davey said with a smile. “So, did I hear right, that the last game of the baseball season is this weekend?” “Yeah.” I answered the question easily. He often did that, totally change tracks when he felt a particular topic had been fully discussed. “I think I’ll go.” Davey said and I laughed.",

      "content": "“What is it, Katie?” I asked her in a short tone of voice. “Marcie’s spreading it around school that you got her pregnant.” Katie said in a hushed voice. “It takes two to tango, and we still don’t know which guy was dancing with her when she got bit.” I said and Katie actually snorted as if she was holding back a laugh. “That’s not quite true.” She said in a quiet voice. “The day you broke up with her, you remember, after that New Year’s party?” “Yes.” I answered. “She was complaining that she’d gotten pissy with you because she was on her period.” Katie said. “Then she asked to borrow a pad from me because she was out.” “If she was having her period after the last time we had sex…” I said with a sudden swelling of hope inside me. I’d been right; even if she was pregnant there was no way it was mine! “I… what she’s doing is wrong.” Katie said. “She’s fixated on you like a bitch in heat but it’s obvious you want nothing to do with her and she’s trying to trap you. It’s wrong. I’m sorry, you should know, but I won’t admit it if you tell anyone. Her little brother’s already threatened to beat me up if I mentioned it to anyone.” “Her little brother knows?” I asked in surprise. “She really is pregnant, Brian.” Katie said in a rush. “It’s just not yours. Too bad for you your family has more money than any of the other guys she’s fooled around with, so they’re going after you to get what money you guys have.” “Her entire family knows?” I said incredulously while she nodded. “Just remember I didn’t tell you any of this!” She said in a rush before turning and heading away at a very quick walk. “You couldn’t pay me enough to have your life, Breckenridge.” Coach Cole’s voice said from behind me and I turned to see him walking around the side of the gym. “You heard?” I asked him and he nodded. “Let’s go in my office and talk.” He suggested and I nodded before following him inside. I’d been continuing with the NJROTC two times a week and had even got a reluctant Davey to join. When he had shut the door and we were seated in his office, he shook his head. “So your ex-girlfriend is trying to trap you into marrying her?” “Something like that, yeah.” I said and told him the whole story from the message on the answering machine to the explosive meeting at my house. I even found myself telling him how Davey had left and not come back. “Hm.” He said with a chuckle. “You and Davey, I didn’t see that one coming.” “I–we–we’re not…” I started to protest but he waved me off. “Breckenridge, I’ve seen the way he looks at you during practice and I wasn’t born yesterday.” Cole was nearly chuckling. “I won’t say I’m exactly comfortable with it, but let’s just say that I got use to turning a blind eye at times in the Navy and I see nothing wrong with continuing that here. You aren’t the only two boys I’ve seen making eyes at each other in this gym.” “I bet.” I said while thinking of Trevor and Brandon who seemed to be developing more and more of a relationship with each other. That surprised me, at least on Trevor’s part since he’d always grown out of his man-on-man attraction by college and gone off to marry a girl, at least according to Davey he’d done that in every other timeline. “Well I’m not going to name names, but let’s get back to your ex.” Cole said with a shake of his head. “What are you going to do about her?” “Call her a slut and demand a paternity test.” I answered. “That was always the plan but after that little conversation you overheard, it’s sounding even better since the paternity test will end the issue forever.” “Six or seven months is a long time, Breckenridge.” Cole reminded me. “A lot can happen in that time and if people start believing her, it won’t matter what the paternity test says, they’ll still believe it’s your kid.” “I know.” I said with a shrug. “That’s where calling her a slut comes into play. Enough people believe she’s a slut and nothing she says will stick, and every guy who has ever fucked her will go scurrying for cover and repeat that she’s a slut just to keep people from thinking it might be theirs.” “Breckenridge, I’m never going to play poker with you.” He said with a laugh after thinking what I’d said over. “You’re ruthless.” “When I have to be, I can be.” I said with a slight smile that I knew looked wicked on me and he shivered visibly. “I’ve learned from the best.” “Who is that?” He asked and I shrugged, realizing I really shouldn’t have said that last part. I’d learned ruthlessness from Davey Jones, but a different Davey Jones than the one he knew. When I didn’t answer, he changed subjects. “Have you given thought to what you might be doing to this baby before it’s even born? Maybe about how your rumor campaign might affect it’s life?” “Nothing I could do would make it any worse for a kid born into that conniving bunch that Marcie calls a family.” I said angrily. “You have a point.” Cole agreed with a nod. “It’s getting close to time for school to start.” “Thanks for the talk, coach.” I said as I stood up to leave. “Not a problem.” Cole said dismissively as I left his office and wondered if I could find Davey before first period. Davey managed to elude me most of the day, mostly because I kept on getting stopped by people to ask if it was true that I’d gotten Marcie pregnant. Most of them had reacted with shock at the blunt way I called her a slut and until the baby was born God was the only one who could possibly know whose kid it really was. Her little brother confronted me at lunchtime, furious that I was calling his sister a slut, and probably more upset that so many people believed that claim. Before he could take a swing at me, Brandon and Trevor had restrained him and I walked away before a teacher could notice. He didn’t bother me after that, and my friends were chuckling at the way the rumors were spreading like wildfire. Marcie had fired her salvo, trying to pin her pregnancy on me, but the day wasn’t even half over before people were starting to form betting pools on who the real father was. During the last P.E. period, I heard Adam turn to Davey and ask him who he was betting for the real father of Marcie’s baby. Davey’s face was a look in priceless shock when he didn’t hear my name on the list at all. “What about Brian?” Davey asked in a sharp tone and a scathing look at me. “Didn’t he sleep with her too?” “Yeah, but he’s probably the only one smart enough to use a condom with a slut like that.” Adam laughed and Davey looked at me with a calculating look. “Your mom said you wanted to talk to them and me after school.” Davey said later, during a slow moment in baseball practice. “I’d like to, yes.” I said softly, not wanting to say anything that could upset him at this point. “Do you think the kid’s yours?” He asked me icily. “I know it’s not.” I said with conviction. “How do you know that?” He asked. “My parents deserve to hear it at the same time as you, and you deserve to hear it at the same time they do.” I told him with a voice that quivered a bit. “You’re just as important to me as they are.” “Am I?” Davey asked and I nodded. “I’ll be there.” He said and walked off while I breathed a sigh of relief. Davey followed me home from practice, and I was in such a hurry that I didn’t even bother to change out of my practice uniform before taking off. Davey had to hurry to catch up before I pulled out of the parking lot, and I noticed him watching my butt as I walked to my car. I’d had these particular practice pants since I was a freshman, and they were tight on me. It’d be a cold day in hell before I admitted to him that I’d worn them today on purpose, knowing how he liked looking at me in tight clothes. Dad was home as we pulled up, having stayed in Modesto and worked from home most of the day. Mom was there and while she frowned at the fact that I hadn’t changed, she noted that I was at least carrying my cleats instead of wearing them inside. I took just enough time to put them up in my room before hurrying back to the living room and sitting down on the towel she’d put on the couch. My uniform wasn’t that dirty, but it wasn’t worth mentioning at this point. “Davey, thanks for being here.” I said to Davey first, who was sitting on the far end of the couch but looking at me steadily while my parents sat on the loveseat and watched me. “Mom, Dad, first off I should thank you too for supporting me in this. It’s not over yet, and it won’t be until we get that… that girl to take a paternity test. The really good news is that when we get that paternity test we’ll be out of this mess.” “You’re sure about that?” Mom asked with concern in her voice. “I am now.” I assured her. “One of Marcie’s former friends told me in secret that the day she broke up with me, after the last time we – we had intercourse – Marcie was having her period and borrowed a pad from her. There’s no way the baby could be mine.” “Could this girl be lying to you?” Dad asked. “She could, but I doubt that’s the case.” I answered. “She has no reason to lie to me, it’s not helpful to Marcie, and well, she also let it slip that Marcie’s little brother was threatening her if she told anyone. It seems like Marcie’s entire family is in on this.” “I’ve taken two calls from her father today, and the last time he threatened to burn our house down if we don’t make you marry her.” Dad said with a frown. “I am so glad to hear there’s no real chance the kid’s yours. The thought of there being any relation between us and them is distasteful. Now that you’re certain, I’m going to report his threats to the police.” “You are?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow as he scooted a little closer to me on the couch. I think no one missed that gesture, and Mom smiled. “Of course I am.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “If they are threatening my family, I’ll take whatever steps I can to protect them, including calling the police.” “You want to be careful with that.” Davey said sadly. “Sometimes, when you do that, the press can get involved. Maybe I shouldn’t spend so much time here, if they get wind of my name and threats against you, they’d definitely jump on the story and I don’t want to put you folks through that. You’ve done too much for me as it is.” “You’re going nowhere young man.” Dad said firmly and with a hint of anger in his voice. “If that happens, we’ll deal with it but I won’t run you off because of a possibility of a story or two in the local rag.” “You don’t know what it’s like.” Davey murmured, but he also looked relieved that dad was insisting he stay. “Davey, we know you and your family well enough now to have some idea.” Mom said while meeting his gaze. “We’re not worried about that. We can deal with it, and we’re not ashamed of you, or of Brian.” “Nor would we be ashamed of either of you, or both of you, if that ever came out either.” Dad said and Davey’s hiss of indrawn breath filled the room and he looked at me with terror in his eyes while Dad actually laughed. So did Mom, and Davey started to relax when he realized they weren’t mocking him, or us. I reached out and took his hand, and at first he resisted, but when I persisted he exhaled and gripped my hand with a death grip. “Believe me when I say we’d rather have you as part of our family than the alternatives.” Mom said and then she frowned. “That didn’t come out quite right. I wouldn’t want you to think I was comparing you to that… girl. There is no comparison, really. For starters, we actually like you whether you’re a part of Brian’s life or not.” “How did you know?” He asked in a weak voice and his hand was shaking as it grasped mine so tightly it hurt. He relaxed a bit as I moved my hands so that our fingers were entwined in a more comfortable grip. “Next time you spend the night in Brian’s room, you should open the window and air out the room.” Dad laughed and Mom blushed, although Davey’s cheeks were rosier than hers. “I don’t think we’ll… I mean… oh fuck, I give up.” Davey murmured and Dad laughed. “You know my parents would be having fits at just the thought and I’m here holding Brian’s hand and you’re laughing at us! It’s not fair! I’m not prepared for this!” “Would you rather we tried to break you up?” Mom asked through her laughter. “No.” Davey said softly as he squeezed my hand and turned to look at me before sliding closer to me, close enough to lean against me. “Are we still together after the way I just ran out on you when you probably needed me?” “Don’t worry about that.” I assured him. “You’re here now.” “Yes, well do we have anymore to discuss or should I start dinner?” Mom asked and I let out a sigh of my own. “You better order a pizza or Chinese.” I told her and she frowned. “That was the easy stuff to discuss.” “The easy stuff?” Dad asked with a hint of horror in his voice and he frowned at my nod. “If that’s the easy stuff, I think maybe we should wait until after we eat.” “No.” I said with a hint of pleading in my voice. “If you make me wait, I think I’ll lose my nerve to tell you, all of you?” “Brian, don’t tell me you’ve killed someone.” Mom said with genuine horror in her voice. “No mom, I haven’t killed anyone in the last fifty years.” I assured her, and transitioned into the real purpose of this little family meeting. “I didn’t have a choice then; the Iraqis had attacked our convoy and were trying to take hostages. Davey was the one who picked up a rifle from a fallen Iraqi Army soldier and started fighting back. I just followed his lead.” “You’re not making any sense.” Dad said with a wild look in his eyes while Davey stared at me like I’d gone crazy. “What are you saying?” “Don’t tell me you’re another Mr. Shelton.” Davey groaned, referencing a seventh grade World History teacher at La Loma. Deranged Mr. Shelton believed in reincarnation and would launch into fanciful stories about having lived through the Black Death in medieval Europe. “No, I’m not talking about reincarnation.” I answered Davey while my parents were starting to look like I’d cracked and gone insane on them. “Although, the more I think about it, reincarnation is damn close, except it’s not being reborn into a whole new life, except in this case it kind of is, but not really.” “Brian, you’re not making sense.” Dad said sternly. “What are you going on about?” “Mr. Shelton was a teacher at La Loma.” Davey started to explain. “I remember the man.” Dad said sharply. “I’m asking what the hell it is Brian’s trying to tell us and failing at so miserably.” “Sorry, it’s really complicated and I’m nervous.” I said in all honesty and realized my hand was shaking slightly in Davey’s. He squeezed it in a comforting gesture and I relaxed a bit. These were my parents and Davey. I’d planned this out while I tossed and turned last night, I knew how to approach this logically, I just needed to calm down. “Why don’t you start at the beginning, then?” Dad suggested and I nodded, taking a deep breath and preparing to begin. “The bottom line of the story is that time travel is more than just possible, it’s a reality.” I said in a much calmer breath, ignoring the looks of continued confusion on their faces or the hiss of indrawn breath from Davey. He’d always been a fan of science fiction and was probably better suited to understanding this than my parents. “In the year 2004 of the original timeline, which is this time we’re in right now, a scientist conducted an experiment that would send the memories, the consciousness if you will, of a person back in time to his younger self.” “And you’re this time traveler.” Davey asked, grasping the idea and for the moment at least, he appeared to be withholding his disbelief. My parents were looking at me like I was crazy. “No, that first time traveler was you, Davey.” I told him and his eyes widened and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I don’t remember anything about the future.” He said quietly. “No you wouldn’t, because we jammed that before it could happen.” I stated. “The thing you have to understand about time travel is that cause and effect can happen simultaneously, or effect preceding cause. In this case, when I came back in time, it was 2054 and we sent a signal that jammed any other transmission that would send a person’s memories back in time.” “Huh?” Dad asked with wide eyes and an incredulous expression. “Are you trying to say you’re eighty-five years old?” Mom asked in a breathy voice. “No, I have the memories of eighty-five years of life in another timeline, but it’s a very different timeline than this one.” I said. “Let’s go back to the beginning on this.” Dad said in an exasperated voice. “It all started in 2004 of this timeline.” I repeated. “A scientist in Livermore built the first working time machine and he tested it out on a man named Davey Jones. Davey traveled back in time, or at least his memories and consciousness traveled back in time, and he woke up in his twelve-year old body on August 1st of 1981.” “This is for real, not a joke?” Dad demanded and I nodded. His sat back in the loveseat and weakly waved a hand for me to on. “Davey thought something had gone wrong with the experiment.” I continued. “He had been told he’d only be able to see events from his young perspective. Instead he found he was in full control of his body, and as days turned into weeks, he realized that he was there to stay. At first he tried to keep from changing anything, but on the first day of the seventh grade he ended up becoming friends with a guy named Brian Breckenridge and two others named Brandon and Trevor.” “You weren’t friends with him back then.” Mom said astutely. “Not in the original timeline, but when he went back in time and made the first change, Davey created a new timeline, what we call Timeline Two.” I explained and she nodded almost as if she was following this explanation. Davey was getting it from the look in his eyes. “I bet I tried to stop my dad from molesting my sister.” Davey said in a weak voice. “That was one of the modest goals that Davey set when he realized he could change the timeline without destroying the universe.” I agreed. “Along the way it was discovered that other time travelers had come back in time and the government found out about Davey.” “Oh shit, I bet that wasn’t good.” Davey said stolidly and Dad shook his head. “What’d they do?” Mom asked as she leaned forward. “Fortunately for Davey, he’d made good friends, and one of those friend’s father had good connections.” I continued. “You see, Mr. Rush, Trevor’s father, he’s not really what he seems.” “Is he another time traveler?” Dad asked. “No, he’s a Soviet defector.” I said and Dad’s eyes widened while mother covered her mouth with a hand. “You’re kidding!” Mom gasped. “No, I’m serious, although I guess you could try to confirm that.” I said with a shrug. “I don’t know how they’d react in this timeline, but eventually it becomes more public knowledge after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” “The Soviet Union collapses?” Dad asked in shock and I chuckled. Davey had said that was the one fact that always made the biggest impact on people in the 1980’s. No one thought the massive juggernaut that was the evil Soviet Union could possibly collapse in on itself like it had so many times in history. “It did in the original timeline and several other timelines except the one where they went to war to keep it from happening.” I said. “How many of these timelines are there?” Davey asked. “This would be Timeline Four if you counted just the timelines created by Davey Jones going back in time.” I answered and he looked surprised. “Most of us call it Timeline Five though because Sean Rule came back to save Davey at the end of Timeline Two when the Soviets sank his ship during that timeline’s World War Three.” “What?” Mom nearly shrieked. “I know that name.” Davey said with a frown. “Didn’t he go to school with us?” “Mighty convenient.” Dad said skeptically. “Sean’s the one who picked Davey as a test subject in the first experiment.” I explained and Dad shook his head. “Two other men went back into that first Timeline. One of them was the scientist who created the device, but he died in an accident. The other was a pro-Soviet Russian who wanted to keep the Soviet Union from collapsing. He almost succeeded, but he was forced into open warfare against the United States. By that time, Davey was a known time traveler, at least by President Reagan and his close advisors. He fought in the Navy during that Timeline’s World War Three. At first, he died when his ship sunk, but Sean Rule came back in time to help him.” “How did that happen if the timeline changed when that Davey went back?” Mom asked and I was surprised at how intuitively she understood this. “The time machine creates a bubble in sub-space that lasts as long as the time machine has power.” I answered her question. “Sean Rule was the last person alive in that bubble and he used the machine’s last bit of power to go back far enough in time to warn the President, who issued orders that saved the original Davey Jones from death and ended World War Three.” “That would deserve a ‘and they lived happily ever after, but they didn’t, did they?” Mom asked and I smiled. “Davey and that timeline’s Brian lived together as a couple for a long time.” I half-answered her question as Davey squeezed my hand. There was a small smile on his face. “So what happened next?” Dad asked as he leaned forward, looking interested. “In Timeline Two’s 2004, a war broke out with mainland China and Taiwan.” I continued my story and was relieved that they were at least listening instead of calling for the men with the straight jackets. “Admiral Davey Jones led US naval forces in the area to a crushing defeat of the attempted Chinese invasion, but the entire war was a diversion. They had kidnapped Sean Rule, the only person who had a working knowledge of how to build a time machine and used him to complete their own time machine. They held his partner, Brandon Walker, and Davey Jones’s partner Brian, hostage. Davey led a SEAL team into the facility but he was too late to stop a Chinese agent from going back in time. He was mortally wounded in the gunfight and went back in time again before he died from his wounds.” “Jesus, it’s like a good sci-fi story.” Davey commented uneasily. “I’m not sure who you think I am but that Davey Jones sounds a bit like Superman.” “No, he wasn’t Superman.” I said with a fond smile on my face. “He was just damn close to the real thing. He knew what he thought was right and he fought for it tooth and nail, and he was damn smart. You have to remember, by that 2004 he had over six decades of life experience behind him but he was only in his early thirties.” “That would be… interesting.” Dad said softly. “Hold on just a minute while I get us some food.” Mom said standing quickly and we sat in silence, just staring at each other until she returned with a tray of fruit, cheeses, and crackers as well as a pitcher of ice tea and four glasses. While everyone munched down, I continued the story, taking them through what I knew of that horrible timeline, Timeline Three and its ending in nuclear annihilation of most of the Earth. “It’s like a love story.” Mom said with tears bristling in her eyes when I recounted the death of my other self from that timeline. I had to agree with her, it was both supremely tragic and awful sweet at the same time. “It’s a sick love story.” Dad said, but he was smirking a bit. “So our intrepid hero Davey Jones goes back once more, right? Does his trusty sidekick Sean go back too?” “Yeah, he does, after a fashion.” I said with a smile at that description of Sean who no one here except Davey had ever met. “This time, Davey ended up back in 1976 instead of the early 1980’s.” “Wait, before or after we moved back from Florida?” Davey said with excitement. “After, but boy did Davey make some changes in that timeline.” I continued. “His seven-year old body couldn’t handle the memories of an adult nearly a hundred, so the brain began to shut down after a short while. Before it did, he really made some big-ass changes.” “Like what?” Davey asked with a light in his eyes. “He got his grandfather to place a few key bets, winning a heck of a lot of money.” I said. “He used that to manipulate his dad into giving up preaching and running for the State Assembly.” “You’re kidding!” Davey exclaimed. “No, and for a while Davey went into a coma while his brain returned to its normal seven-year old function, but Davey had set up a system where he was able to warn key people about big problems that were coming up.” I continued with a wistful expression on my face. “Some of those changes included an early warning about AIDS, and it saved Uncle Rich’s life.” “Oh my.” Mom said as tears came to her eyes and Dad put a comforting hand on her leg. She leaned into him for a bit of support. “Yes, well, eventually Davey’s brain matured enough that his ‘older’ self woke up again, and he set more changes into place.” I continued. “His father went from a member of the California Assembly to a member of the President’s cabinet and ended up the Secretary of Agriculture. Davey and Brian were friends for several years before they started dating.” “And dad, he never…” Davey’s voice faltered, unable to speak the question. “No, Davey’s sister was never molested, and she ended up being a fighter pilot in the Air Force and one of the highest ranking female combat veterans in the history of the Armed Forces.” I answered and he shook his head in disbelief before a smile appeared on his face. “It sounds like paradise.” Davey whispered. “I haven’t even mentioned that David Jones Sr. eventually became President in that timeline, the timeline I was born in.” I said softly and Dad snorted in disbelief. “You almost had me going there, Brian.” Dad said. “You should write this down and sell it.” “I’m being serious, dad.” I said. “I was born in that timeline, Timeline Four.” “Then why are you here now?” Mom asked and I smiled sadly. “I assume you and that super-Davey lived a long happy life together?” “We did, with two kids, half a dozen grandkids and dozens of great-grandkids.” I answered and Davey squeezed my hand at those words. “We had a family together?” Davey asked and I smiled at him. “I told you it was possible the other night.” I reminded him and he nodded after a moment. “So what happened?” Mom asked. “Terrorists, probably a Dhu Ghal branch from Ireland managed to get a dirty bomb into Washington D.C.” I answered her question and she looked confused. “That’s a super-long story, but Dhu Ghal was an Irish separatist movement that started after the European Common cracked down on member states. The United States helped them at first, giving them weapons because the EC was trashing the US economy. Then they reached an agreement with the EC and they abandoned Dhu Ghal. When that happened, Dhu Ghal decided to teach the US a lesson and set off a dirty bomb they’d gotten from our country. Washington D.C. was irradiated by deadly amounts of radiation, poisoning most of Congress. “Every President since David Jones Sr. had been made aware of Project Do Over. Davey and Sean had built a time machine, just in case it was ever needed, and President White authorized a Do Over. Sean and I, the only two with the codes who could activate the machine used it to do two things.” “What happened to me, to the Davey who’d gone back all those other times, I mean.” Davey asked and I sighed. “He had a stroke before the bomb went off and couldn’t help out.” I said feeling the grief at that memory well up inside of me, and my voice shook as I spoke. The comforting grip of his hand reassured me though and I blinked away the tears from my eyes. “I loved him, but he couldn’t help, so I went with Sean to activate the time machine. The first thing we did was set off a jamming device that Sean and Brandon came up with over the years. It effectively wiped out the other time travelers and reset the timeline to the original one, the one that would have progressed if time travel had never been invented.” “Then why did you come back?” Dad asked with his eyebrows furrowed. “It seems to me if you took the trouble to undo time travel you’d have left it at that.” “It seems terrorism is a bigger threat than we had imagined.” I said and Dad’s frown deepened. “Then why come back this far again?” Mom asked. “To give me time to think about the problem, and work towards a fix.” I explained. “It’s not something that can change with just a bit of knowledge, but it’s going to take a lifetime, at least, so we went as far back as we had the power to go. I’m sorry Davey, I’d have come back further to stop what happened to your sister if I could.” “I believe that.” Davey said simply, and his trust bolstered my confidence. “What happened to the Brian of this timeline?” Dad asked and I sighed. This was the question I feared the most. “When I came back, his memories were overwritten in favor of mine.” I said. “But you are our son, our Brian.” Mom asked. “Yes and no.” I answered. “You see, much of this timeline, it’s very similar to Davey’s original timeline, although now there are differences since I came back. In that original timeline, Davey and Brian were never friends. I’m pretty sure the original Brian married Marcie and had kids with her. Our lives were mostly the same though, except for the time that Davey struck me out in little league when we were real young, and then later when we became friends in junior high. That never happened here, of course.” “This is confusing.” Dad said simply, but he looked me in the eyes for several minutes before continuing. “You are, but you aren’t quite our son is what you’re saying. It wasn’t you who dated and… and slept with Marcie.” “That’s correct.” I answered. “I think we need some time to think this over.” Dad said softly and I stood up. “You should know, there are some differences in the parents I knew from the last timeline and you, but there aren’t many. You’re as much my parents as they were, and I’m as much your son as the Brian who was here before I came back that night in January. I think you can figure out which night it was.” I said in a rush. “That’s one thing I understand about this.” Dad said softly. “Just give us a few minutes, please, son?” “Okay, dad.” I said with a sigh of relief that he still thought of me as his son. Davey followed me as I went to my bedroom, and he shut the door behind me. I was too scared to turn around and look in his eyes. That wasn’t necessary, though, because he stepped up behind me and wrapped his arms around me, his hands rubbing my crotch through my practice pants. “Dude, that’s some fucking story.” He said as he nibbled on my neck. “What are you doing?” I asked him with a little surprise. “Taking advantage of your old ass.” Davey joked and I turned around in his grasp with surprise writ in large letters across my face. “You’re not…you’re not like grossed out or anything?” I asked him with surprise. When I’d been in his shoes it had taken me days to adjust to this news. “Dude, we’re like star-crossed lovers who chase each other across time.” Davey said with a wicked smile as he pecked at my lips. “If there’s anything that could be more fucking romantic or reassuring that we’re meant to be, I don’t know what it could possibly be. It’s like after hearing that story I know we’re meant to be together and I could care less who knows. Do you know how hot you look dressed like this? You drove me fucking crazy all afternoon and now, now I just don’t care. It’s like I can say whatever I want because nothing can come between us and I know this is what we’re meant to be, together.” “Kiss me.” I growled, not quite understanding his logic, but agreeing we were meant to be together. In another time, it had taken me days to realize that very same thing. Once again, Davey had proven just how much smarter than he was than I. He was also one hell of a kisser, I realized yet again as I came perilously close to an orgasm just from him kissing me. Nothing else really mattered in the end, I was here, with Davey, and together nothing could stop us. Nothing. Chapter 12 Davey and I did little more than kiss and grope each other a bit before my parents knocked on the door to tell us that dinner had been ordered. Davey sighed as I mentioned that I was going to take a shower and get changed, but he gave me one final kiss before leaving the room. When I was showered and changed, the conversation continued while we ate Chinese. “We’ve reached the conclusion that our son is either very deranged, or something we can’t quite understand has happened.” Dad said as we all filled our plates with the food. He and Mom looked worn out already, and Mom had a sad expression on her face. “What we don’t understand is, if this is true, what happened to our Brian.” Mom said quietly, moving the food around on her plate without taking a bite. “I am ‘your’ Brian.” I answered emphatically. “The only difference is that I have more memories than I did before January, and I’ve lost a few memories. Everything else about me is the same.” “I don’t think that’s quite accurate.” Dad said with a frown and a significant look at Davey. “I’ll be blunt about this.” I said firmly, catching the eyes of both of them before continuing. “I’ve always been bi-sexual, attracted to both guys and girls. Before January, I might have allowed myself to believe that Marcie was the girl I loved, but I know better now.” “How do you know that?” Davey asked, speaking up after hurriedly swallowing a bite of chow mien. “I’m not the same Davey Jones you fell in love with in that other timeline.” “Yes, you are.” I said passionately. “You may not have all the memories that he had, but you are the same person.” “That just doesn’t make sense.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Our experiences are part of who we are as people.” “Mom, is Dad the same person you married?” I asked her pointedly. “Is he exactly the same as he was when you met him and fell in love?” “No, and that’s my point.” Mom argued. “It’s the experiences we’ve had since we got married that make us who we are today. How can you say you’re our son when you don’t have the memories of us, the memories he should have from the time he was born?” “I do have most of the same memories.” I countered. “My life in this timeline and in my original timeline was much the same, except for a few minor events. They didn’t start to differ at all until 1981.” “But that’s five years of changed memories.” Mom asserted. “You’re not him, and I want to understand what happened to him.” “He’s here, in me, and I’m in him.” I argued. “We’re one and the same. It’s like I’ve got amnesia of those years, and memories of other years.” “I don’t know if I can accept that.” Mom muttered. “It’s like my son died and was replaced by an imposter.” “Do you remember when we visited Uncle Rich back in ’78?” I asked her. “We got into that argument and I stormed out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. You spent two hours driving around San Francisco looking for me and I was in the back seat of the car the entire time. You hit a light pole when I sat up in the back seat and asked what you were doing.” “You remember that?” Mom asked with wide eyes. “I told you, I am your son!” I stated emphatically. “It’s just that I have slightly different memories of a few years.” There was silence around the table while everyone picked at their food. Nearly twenty minutes passed before anyone spoke again. “So how old are you?” Dad asked, breaking the long silence. “Are you in your eighties or are you seventeen?” “I’m seventeen with a lot more memories than your average seventeen-year-old.” I answered. “ “You said your timeline was different from this one, but that there’s a lot of things the same.” Davey said next. “When the Challenger blew up, you said it was something wrong with the O-rings on the booster. Is that how you knew, because it blew up in your timeline?” “No, it never blew up.” I shrugged. “It blew up in the original timeline that Davey was from. In nearly every subsequent timeline he managed to stop it from happening, and a few other events from happening as well. Other things, like earthquakes, hurricanes, and some wars happened anyway.” “You said you came back because terrorism threatened the future of this timeline.” Dad said slowly, as if he was thinking each word over carefully before speaking. How are you going to do something about that if you won’t let the government know about you?” “It’ll take time, and making sure I’m in the right position to advise the right people at the right time.” I answered. “I had decades of conversations with time traveler Davey, and with Sean as well. Before he had his stroke, Davey reached the conclusion that stopping a single event, or a series of events might change subsequent events, but they alone don’t change history for the better and usually the changes end up being for the worse.” “Why is that?” Mom asked. “Because you’re right in that our experiences, our memories make us who we are as time goes by.” I said. “If you stop too many of the horrors from happening, people forget about the dangers of certain things, and they get reckless. It’s like a kid who’s never been burned seeing a huge bonfire as a young adult and not realizing he can’t stick his hands in the fire without getting burned.” “I’m not sure I understand that.” Dad said and I let out a sigh. “It’s not easy to grasp right away.” I replied. “The fact is that the Challenger accident brought about much needed reforms. With Davey’s shortcut to helping stop it from happening, NASA didn’t learn the lessons it needed to learn and we ended up losing two more shuttles to accidents by the end of the 1990’s. In the end, what we theorized was that what needed to be changed weren’t specific events, but our understanding and learning from those events. In many ways, we need to have our bubble pricked and learn some hard lessons.” “Like what?” Dad asked. “Do you really want a deep political/philosophical discussion right now about international relations and the short-sightedness of our current social-economical system?” I asked while arching my eyebrow. “Not right now, no.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “Good, because I do have school in the morning.” I laughed. “Aren’t you finding school boring?” Mom asked me. “I mean, you’ve been through school already, and probably college, right?” “I’ve been through high school, college, law school, and gone back for two doctorates as well.” I answered and Dad snorted. “You went to law school?” Dad asked and I nodded while he shook his head. “Figures you wanted a lawyer to deal with Ellsworth and his daughter.” “God, I’d be bored if I had to go back through high school.” Davey muttered. “It’s not the most exciting thing in the world, except I do enjoy sports, and NJROTC, and all the other stuff that goes along with school.” I said with a shrug and Davey looked at me like I was crazy. “Besides, if I want to go to college again, I’ll need a high school diploma and they won’t just hand me one if I ask because I’m a time traveler.” “No, I guess they wouldn’t.” Mom said with a slight smile. For the next few hours, all three of them peppered me with questions about my life in the other timeline, and I could see the wariness and distrust fading from their eyes as I answered the questions. Several times my parents asked me questions that required answers slightly different than answers I’d previously given. It was obvious they were trying to delve into the truth of this situation as much as possible by trying to uncover any inconsistencies they could. What food remained uneaten had long since grown cold by the time dad yawned and stretched. “I think I’ve heard enough.” Dad said with a long look at Mom first and then at me. “At this point, I have to admit that as crazy as it sounds, I believe you. I’m still not sure how I feel about everything, but I’m ready to sleep on it.” “Thank you.” I said and stood up. “If you don’t mind, I’ll call it a night now. There’s school in the morning, and I have a test in English.” “I’ll be back in a minute to help clean everything up.” Davey said as he stood to follow me out. He led the way to my bedroom but stopped outside the door and looked at me with a slightly worried expression. “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “I’m wondering about you and me, and all this.” Davey said softly, looking into my eyes as if hunting for a lifeline. “I mean, I know you think we’re meant to be together, and it sounds like a dream come true. But I can’t help but feel it’s wrong.” “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “You, me, the whole sex thing.” He said softly. “I guess I can’t lie to you, you’re not the first guy I’ve had sex with, but I’ve always thought it was wrong; something not to be thought about, much less discussed. Until you, I didn’t even think it was possible to really feel love for another guy, I thought it was just about sex and girls were who you fell in love with.” “I know.” I said sympathetically and he smirked. “Of course you know, it’s me who doesn’t know.” He said softly. “I want it to be true, that you and I can live together and love each other, but I don’t know if I can.” “Take it one day, one moment at a time.” I suggested. “You came back twice and sought me out, and you were right to do that. The thing is, it was me who was where you were at right now, except I never really expressed it to him in words. Davey, the other you, the one with all those memories, he was so confident about us when I knew him. Still, he took his time with me, let me reach the decision that I loved him and wanted him, and he gave me time to work out my issues with the whole time travel crap.” “What did you do?” He asked. “It took me days to reach the decision you did earlier tonight.” I said with a shrug and he smiled. “I’ve always known you’re smarter than I am.” “No I’m not.” Davey demurred. “I wonder though, when you look at me, do you see me or do you see him? Do you love me because of him?” “You are him.” I asserted. “I said it earlier and I meant what I said. The only difference between you and the Davey I spent a lifetime with is that he had more memories than you do right now. As far as I can see, you are, at your core, the same person that he was, and it is those qualities that attract me to you, no matter what memories you do or do not possess.” “So you see both of us?” He asked and I couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s one thing I’ve always loved about you Davey Jones.” I said softly, reaching out and caressing his right arm. “You are quick on your feet and figure things out so much quicker than I ever could hope to do.” “Stop that.” He said with blushing cheeks and I leaned in to kiss him on the cheek. Davey pulled me into a hug before releasing me and turning to head back into the dining room. I got ready for bed, and although I should have been unable to sleep, as soon as I lay down on the bed, I was asleep. The next morning I woke up to icy water being dribbled on my face. Davey actually giggled as he scampered out of my room while I sat up in bed spluttering with indignation. The sun was barely touching the mountains in the east, but I found Davey in the kitchen wearing a sweat suit that mom had bought him the other day. It was really nice cotton pants in a dark blue and a gray hooded sweatshirt. “It’s about time you got up, old man.” He teased me and I realized I was in for a lot of payback for all the times I called him ‘old man’ in the last timeline. Still, the fact that he was taking it so well made me feel good inside. “I thought we’d just go for a run from here instead of going to the school.” “You’re really getting into this exercise stuff, aren’t you?” I asked him and he shrugged while blushing slightly over his orange juice. “I feel better after.” He said with another shrug. “Besides, it’s something we do that’s just the two of us. I like that.” “So do I.” I said warmly, getting my own glass of orange juice. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants that were a lighter blue than his, so after downing the juice, I went back to my room to finish getting dressed. We were now doing a good three miles on the morning runs, and at a decent pace without even having to stop for a walk. Davey was inordinately proud of that little fact, and when we got home to find Mom in the kitchen, he gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek before heading off to the shower, calling his dibs on first use of the bathroom. “He’s in a good mood.” Mom said after he’d left. There was a bit of tension in the air, and while I filled a glass of water, she gave me a long look before letting out a sigh. “You doing okay?” I asked her. “Yes, Brian, I am.” She answered. “I think I’m going to be okay with what you’ve told us. I look at you and you look no different, except for maybe the way you carry yourself. I hadn’t realized it before, but you’ve been a lot more confident without that arrogant pose I’d gotten used to seeing. You are different, but in all the important things I think you’re still my Brian.” “I’m glad to hear that, Mom.” I said earnestly. “How much does this change things?” She asked. “Do you expect to be treated like an adult now?” “Well, I am almost seventeen.” I replied with a smile and she chuckled. “In other words, I’m your son and I’ll always be your son. You’ll always be my mother, Dad will always be my father. Our relationship will change as the years go by, but no matter what else, I’m physically seventeen and I’m living under your roof.” “You had kids in that other timeline, right?” She asked even though we’d gone over that several times last night. “Yes, two boys.” I replied. “Do you think you’ll want kids in the future?” She asked me with a wistful look on her face. “I know you said people’s opinions on gays as parents change, but will you go through having kids again? It must have hurt a lot to leave them behind like that.” “I miss them a lot, but the truth is they were probably injured or killed when the dirty bomb went off.” I said with a slight shrug. “There wasn’t much time to think about that while Sean and I were getting ready to do our duty, but I’ve grieved over them the last couple of months here, and I’ve realized there wasn’t much I could do for them. As for kids in the future, more than likely we will, if Davey still wants them.” “Does he?” Mom asked. “Probably.” I said with a shrug. “Everything’s too new right now for us to have talked about it much.” “I guess so.” She replied and then got a worried look on her face. “Doesn’t the age difference bother you? Every time I think about it I get a little uncomfortable.” “I’m seventeen, mom.” I reminded her. “Sure I have more memories, but that doesn’t make it all that different. I remember being old, sure, but the body really does affect the brain as well as the brain affecting the body. I’m not in my eighties anymore, and I know that.” “Still, couldn’t you use your knowledge to influence him in a bad way?” Mom asked with a worried tone. “I could, but I won’t.” I said with a shrug. “In our relationship, I might have opened the door for him, but I didn’t trick him into walking through it, he did that on his own.” “I did what on my own?” Davey asked as he came into the room with his shaggy hair still wet, but he was wearing a newer pair of jeans and a sleeveless light blue OP shirt with a hood. The shirt showed off his much more slender body, and his arms that were starting to develop some good muscle. I had to turn away from Mom so she wouldn’t see the reaction, but a glance back showed her smothering a laugh. “Fall for this big guy here.” Mom said and Davey blushed while looking down at the table. “What will you boys have for breakfast?” “Cereal please.” Davey said and mom proceeded to get him a bowl. “I’ll have some too when I finish showering.” I said. “Davey, I hope you left me some hot water.” “Nope.” He said with a smarmy grin and I cuffed him up the side of the head before scooting out of the kitchen. Marcie wasn’t in school that day, to the relief of many, and it seemed that the furor over her paternity allegations was already dying down to be replaced by sniggers about her being a slut. I almost felt bad for her as I realized that she’d be shunned for the rest of her high school career, but in the end she’d deserved what she’d gotten. She’d gambled on her future and lost badly. As the days, and then the weeks progressed, things evened out and life became downright pleasant for the most part. Davey and I both took the ASVAB test in late March, just before spring break. Talk about ‘time travel’ became infrequent as he and my parents saw that I was much the same person they’d known and they grew accustomed to the concept that I just had a few extra memories rolling around in my head. Davey’s mother ended up having to go through detox after she recovered from her surgery because they’d given her too much morphine and she’d grown addicted to the stuff. Davey took his sister to visit her every weekend, and I even went with them a couple of time. Monta stayed up there, living in Uncle Rich’s old apartment and turning up her lip every time she saw a gay couple, but other than a few comments about Davey and I ‘being careful’ when we were up there, she didn’t say much. The biggest change was Dad’s business venture. They landed a few big clients right off the bat, and as a result he ended up being gone for most of each week, and even occasionally over the weekends. We all missed him, but Mom was especially lonely, and I wasn’t surprised when she ended up going to see him a couple of days a week. Most of the stuff she was doing was charity work, and she didn’t need to be in town all week. Davey and I didn’t mind since he liked to make love in all sorts of interesting places. That was one of the biggest differences for me to adjust to in this timeline. The Davey I’d known had been a passionate, skilled lover, but he’d been very discreet. Most of the time we’d made love it had been in a bed, behind closed doors and curtains. This Davey found the most amazing places to unbutton my pants, including in the mornings on the way to school, in the gym shower after baseball practice when he’d purposely delayed me so the rest of the team had already left, the backyard of the house after a friendly wrestling match, and along the canal bank during an early morning run. He wasn’t the only one doing the seducing though. I knew him very well, and I had to admit that a young sex drive, and having Davey in my reach again made me very horny. Barely an hour went by when I wasn’t thinking about the next time Davey and I would have sex, and I did my best to get him back for all the times he’d ambush me, pulling down my pants before I could protest. Davey got turned on by a lot of things, and chief among them were tight clothes. Whether it was me in my baseball uniform, or just wearing a particularly tight pair of jeans and a tight t-shirt, I could see his eyes glaze over whenever I wore something form-fitting. Male birds were often very colorful in order to attract a mate, and I knew that clothing always attracted Davey like few other things could. In the last timeline, when his family could afford nice clothes, I’d never quite understood why what I wore could have such an impact on his lust, but having seen the poor clothing that his family could afford in this timeline, I understood this aspect of him better. The Davey of that timeline had been a product of a rather poor family, and the effects of that had stayed with him from his original childhood. “I’m going to rip those pants off you later.” That was something I heard almost every day from Davey, usually as a hushed whisper as we walked from one class to the next, and every time I’d shiver in anticipation of that happening. Almost always he did manage to rip them off of me, and I knew better than to change out of whatever clothing had turned him on so much, rather waiting to let him peel them off of me. He enjoyed it nearly as much as I did. Dad joined us to go fishing with Pete during the middle of March on a Saturday. Davey was surprised at how good of an experience it was, with all of us catching several fish (including Davey actually catching his first one despite all the times he’d gone fishing with Pete as a kid). His grandfather seemed to have lightened up a bit, and barely even complained about paying off Davey’s car or continuing to make his car insurance payments. My relationship wasn’t just about sex with Davey, and although he usually went to his own room and slept in his own bed, we usually spent an hour or two in my room, just cuddling together on my bed while we talked quietly. He had a lot of questions, ranging from how to accept being gay and in a relationship to discussions about the last timeline, and what I had planned for this timeline. Most of the time he just listened, but as the days went by, he started proposing some of his own ideas, or critiquing mine in a way that showed me he really was thinking through my ideas, and that he was willing to be with me through the whole thing, taking an active part in what I hoped would be a productive change for the world. The Monday a week before the start of Spring Break, we all sat in the dining room after dinner for a talk about what we would do for the break. Normally my family went on a trip somewhere for a few days, and my parents would tell me where we were going at this time, having kept it as a surprise while they made their plans. “Boys, we’d planned for a trip to Los Angeles this year, including you, David.” Dad said when we were finished helping Mom with the dishes. “Unfortunately I have a business meeting next week that I have to attend so we’ve had to cancel our plans.” “I understand.” Davey said with a sigh. “Thanks for including me in the plans though.” “You’re as much a part of this family as Brian, David.” Mom said with a smile and a long look at him. He blushed but didn’t protest. “As for what we’re going to do next week, Dad’s having to travel for his meeting so we’re going with him for the entire week instead of just a couple of days. His work will pay for his airfare, and we’ve gotten a good deal for the rest of us and for our hotel rooms. You boys won’t mind sharing a room will you?” “No.” Davey said with another blush and she laughed. “Where are we going?” I asked. “Hawaii.” Dad said with a broad smile and my face lit up as did Davey’s. “Is this something to do with the Grayson merger?” Davey asked after we’d smiled at each other. Since he still did a bunch of typing for dad, it figures he’d have some idea what was going on in Dad’s business. “Yes.” Dad said and he had a proud smile on his face. I was pretty sure that Davey had been showing much more interest in dad’s work than I was, and Dad seemed to appreciate that. He and Davey had really bonded the longer that Davey stayed with us. “Would you like to come along to the meetings?” “I’d like that.” Davey said with a broad smile that my father returned. The last week of school before break flew by as we prepared for our trip. Davey blushed when we went to the sporting good store and I insisted that he buy a Speedo for the trip, but he did buy it, and he made sure that I bought one as well. Brandon, Trevor, and Todd (who was beginning to hang out with us more) were all jealous of our getting to go to Hawaii. Davey’s sister pouted for a day or two, but since she was going to Memphis with her friend’s family, she wasn’t too upset. The only real snag came up when Davey visited his mother the day before we were to leave. At first she said she wouldn’t let him go, but Monta stepped in and told her she was being selfish. Davey and I wisely left the hospital room while Monta proceeded to chew Sandy out about her trying to hold her son back from having fun just because she was stuck in the hospital. When we came back into the hospital room twenty minutes later, she grudgingly gave her permission for Davey to go. It had been a long flight to Hawaii, but Davey was full of energy and passion when we finally got checked into our hotel. Hawaii is three hours behind California in time, so it was late afternoon when we got there, and I spent the hours before dinner with Davey, breaking in our hotel room’s bed. I’d have to remember to leave a tip for the maids because our bed was a mess by the time we got dressed for dinner, and I was walking a little bit funny, hoping my parents would chalk it up to all the sitting during the long flight out here. On Monday while Davey went to some meeting with my father, I was dragged out for shopping with my mother. All things considered, there were worse ways to spend the day than shopping in Honolulu. I even managed to pick up another Speedo for Davey, pitch black with gray stripes, while mom arranged for surfing lessons that Davey and I could take the next couple of days. That meant we also had to get short wet suits for the surfing lesson, and my mouth watered at the thought of Davey wearing one of them. When he tried it on later that night in the hotel room, I hoped the maids cleaning our room were at least mollified by the large tip I’d leave them in the morning. Davey didn’t seem to mind, although he wasn’t quite sure about surfing. We spent Tuesday morning learning to surf before he returned to the hotel room to get dressed for a meeting that he was going to with Dad. During the lesson, I’d noticed one of the other guys that was learning to surf with us talking to Davey, and Davey flirting back a bit. That got me jealous, and Davey noticed the jealousy with a little smirk that oddly enough set me at ease. Davey turning down the guy’s suggestion of meeting up later in the week for some ‘practice’ made me feel even better. The week in Hawaii passed quickly for all of us, and I had to admit that I felt a lot more relaxed than I had been. School had been getting very hectic the last couple of weeks with mid-terms and preparing for the ASVAB. I also had a make-up testing of the SAT tests coming up in April, but during the trip I was able to not worry about that. Instead, I soaked up the sun with Davey, wiped out while trying to surf, went snorkeling in Hanama Bay, and we all went to a luau on Thursday night. Friday was our last full day since we were flying out early Saturday morning, and I’d talked my parents into letting Davey and I go off by ourselves. I didn’t tell Davey where we were going, and he watched me anxiously as we took a series of buses to get to our destination. It was still fairly early in the morning, just a little past nine, and we both wore shorts over our Speedos, and tight white t-shirts. We’d packed our snorkeling gear into two bags that we carried, and from that Davey had figured we were going to a beach, but hadn’t figured out anything else. When we got to the beach I’d picked out, I was glad to see that it was still fairly empty. Together we picked out a spot, put down our towels, took off our shorts, donned our snorkeling gear and headed out into the water. Davey was wearing the new black Speedo with gray stripes while I was wearing a red pair that I knew he really, really liked. There weren’t all that many schools of fish around where we snorkeled, and we ended up playing tag in the water, chasing each other over and under the waves tagging each other on the butt and then swimming off as we were chased. We did that for nearly two hours before we were both tired enough to head back up to the beach. It was nearing noon, and the beach was crowded with people as we waded back up out of the water, carrying our flippers in one hand and snorkel masks in the other. Davey stopped cold as he looked around at the crowded beach and turned to me with wide eyes. “This is why you picked this place.” He said with a little half-grin. “Yes.” I said, moving the mask to the hand with the flippers and reaching out to put my arm around him in public. He stiffened slightly at the touch, but relaxed against me a moment later and we walked back to our towels like that. As we walked there were many guys looking at us, some with lust in their eyes, some with sly smiles, and others with friendly looks on their face. Davey kept staring at them, and when we passed two guys that were so busy kissing each other that they didn’t see us go by, I could feel Davey’s body relax. When we laid down on our towels, dropping our gear, he scooted over so that he was firmly against my side and leaned in to kiss my ear. “I love you Brian.” Davey said softly and I looked up to see tears in his eyes as he looked at me before looking around. “I thought I was going to freak out the first time you and I walked around the Castro. Most of those were just too weird, but here, it’s no different than the other beaches we went to this week except it’s almost all guys.” “I thought you should see this before we go.” I said with a smile as I also looked around. “Do you think they’d freak out if we fucked right here?” Davey asked with a vivacious leer that caused a swelling in my Speedos. Instinctively I moved my hand to cover my crotch, but I decided to tease Davey instead and let him see the lump growing there. “They’d probably just take pictures or try to join in and then you’d be put in jail.” I said with a shrug. “But if you want, I won’t stop you.” “It’d suck going to jail for having sex with my boyfriend.” Davey joked. “Who said anything for going to jail over having public sex with me?” I joked back and he looked confused until I finished the statement. “You’d go to jail for starting a riot after I refused to let anyone but me touch you.” “Har har, very funny.” Davey said as he swatted my arm and laid back on his towel, stretching out to soak up some sun. I did the same, and felt a little thrill as his hand found mine and we entwined our fingers while soaking up the warm Hawaiian sun. Life was good, damn good. Chapter 13 “Guess whose moving back to town?” Todd asked as he spotted me while I did my presses. We were in my backyard. Davey’s mom had come home last week, and he was helping her get settled. Monta had come back with her after having been gone for nearly three months from her own home, and had thrown a fit at the condition of her house. Jenny was back from staying with her friend, and was resenting having to once again share a room with her mother. Sandy was doing much better, and the extra time in the hospital while she got over the morphine addiction had actually given her extra time for intensive physical therapy that had her on the verge of being ready to go back to work instead of having weeks more of physical therapy. “Who?” I asked Todd as I finished the set. Todd still came over two times a week to work out with us on the weight set, and was becoming a better friend with each passing week. “Sean Rule.” He said with a grin and I was glad I’d just put the weights back on their holder because I would have dropped them otherwise. “You’re kidding; I thought he and his family lived down south.” I said, trying not to show exactly how excited I was by the news. “Yeah, well I just heard they’re moving back here over the summer.” Todd said. “I remember what you said about wanting to apologize to him for what you did back in freshman year, and now you’re going to get your chance. Don’t worry, I’ll put in a good word for you beforehand.” “Thanks.” I said sardonically. “Okay, let’s get these set up for me.” Todd said, changing the subject. “I’m not a big fucking ape like you and Davey.” “Well at least you’re no longer a pee-wee.” I said as I stood up and wrapped my hand around his biceps. He was definitely more toned there. “Hey, hands off the merchandise or I’ll tell my best friend you’re playing around on him.” Todd teased, having already figured out Davey and I, of course his catching us making out one day in the garage helped him put two and two together. “You’re just jealous.” I teased him back as we took off some of the weights for him to do his own set. “Damn right I’m jealous, I should have had Davey.” Todd smirked. There was just enough bitterness in his voice that I knew he was partially serious, but the look in his eyes also told me that he was resigned to the fact that Davey was mine. That was a good thing, Todd was a good guy and I’d hate to have to set him straight on how things stood. “Who wouldn’t be?” I said instead of something harsher and he chuckled before lying back on the bench and getting ready for his sets. Forty minutes later he was driving off in his beetle and I took my third shower of the day to clean off the sweat from our workout. Davey came home after dinner, and one look at his face had me worried. His eyes were red and puffy. “What’s wrong, honey?” Mom asked as soon as she saw him enter the living room where we were watching television with Dad who’d actually gotten home earlier than normal. “I… it’s my mom.” Davey stammered and mom was up off the couch and hugging him before guiding him over to sit next to me. His hand found mine and clasped it tightly. “What’s wrong?” Dad asked. “I thought she was home from the hospital?” “She is.” Davey sniffed, barely holding back the tears. “That’s what’s wrong.” “What do you mean?” Mom asked while putting a hand on his shoulder. “She… she’s already got a job lined up for as soon as the doctor clears her for work.” Davey sniffed again. “She’ll start in a couple of weeks and as soon as she does, she wants to move out of Nanny’s.” “Shouldn’t that be a good thing?” I asked with a frown. “It is.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “The only problem is that she wants me to move back in with her.” “Dear, she’s your mother; of course she wants her children home with her.” Mom said gently and Davey shook his head. “That’s the thing, she’s not sure where we’re going to move.” Davey moaned softly. “Jenny wants to stay at Ceres High, that’s where all her friends are, and if mom gets a place in Ceres, that means I have to go to Ceres as well and I don’t want to go to that stupid school. Mom’s considering moving into a place in Downey’s district, but Jenny’s dead-set against it and I can’t make mom choose me over Jenny. It wouldn’t be right, I mean my sister’s been through so much – more than me – and she deserves to go to the school where her friends are.” “So do you.” I said with a firm clasp of his hand in mine and he sighed. “It wouldn’t matter anyway, because if she moved into Downey’s district it would be more expensive than the housing in Ceres.” Davey said with a sigh. “Either way, she won’t make enough money on her own, and Dad’s barely making enough to pay Grandma Jones the rent she charges him for staying with her. That means I’ll have to get a real job.” “You already do work for me, that is a real job.” Dad said and Davey let out a bark of laughter. “I’m sorry, Dad B.” Davey said. He’d started calling Dad that after the Hawaii trip and my father still smiled every time he heard Davey say it, even now. “I don’t mean that it’s not a real job just that I don’t make as much money doing it like I did at McDonald’s. Sure, I make more per hour, but I had a lot more hours and Mom will need that money to make rent and pay for food and all that.” “What about your after-school activities and the stuff we’ve already planned for the summer?” I asked him and he frowned. “I’m sorry, Brian, but I’m just not going to be able to do all that.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and a shake of his head. “Mom needs the extra money and I need to help her and Jenny first, before anything else. It just wouldn’t be right for me to do otherwise.” “What about college, David?” Dad asked while I contemplated Davey. His mouth was set in a determined way that I knew all too well. He’d made up his mind, and right now there would be no moving him. He did grimace at dad’s question though. “I can go to MJC part-time after I finish high school next year.” Davey said after a moment of thinking. He looked over at me sympathetically. “I know you wanted me to go to school with you, Brian, but you understand, don’t you? After Jenny graduates, mom won’t need my help anymore and then I can go meet you wherever you’re going to school. Credits from MJC will transfer, right?” “Yes, they will.” I said with a sigh. “Are you sure about this? Davey I know you want to help them but is it worth the cost to yourself?” “Of course it is.” Davey snorted indignantly. “If that’s your decision, that’s your decision.” Dad said with a note of finality. “We’re going to miss having you around here, son.” “I’ll still be around.” Davey said with a sad smile. “I mean, it’s not like I’m breaking up with Brian, and I really do appreciate everything you have all done for me so I’ll be here whenever I can get away.” “You’re at least going to finish the year at Downey, right?” Mom asked. “Yeah, and if we’re lucky, Mom will pick the place in Modesto so I can still go there.” Davey said with a little smile. “We can always continue using Nanny’s address for Jenny so she can go to Ceres, and either Mom or I can take her there in the mornings.” “That would be good.” I said and squeezed Davey’s hand again. “I’ve got some homework to do now if you don’t mind.” Davey said as he stood up. Both Mom and Dad gave him a hug before he went into his bedroom and I was left in the living room with my parents. “What do you think, Brian?” Dad asked me softly when Davey was gone to his bedroom. “He’s set on doing this.” I said with a shrug. “He obviously doesn’t like it, but he thinks it is the right thing to do, and he’ll do anything for his mother and sister.” “Even after what his mother did when she brought him back to California?” Mom asked. I’d told her that part of the story and she’d been furious for most of that night. “Even after that.” I answered her question. “Davey’s very forgiving when it comes to those he loves. You know he went to talk to his father last week, right?” “He didn’t tell us that.” Dad said with surprise. “What happened?” “His father was trying to make a go at selling medical equipment but the company folded.” I explained. “The man’s desperate for a job, and he asked Davey’s help in getting a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres.” “Ouch.” Dad winced. “That must be hard for both of them.” “Yeah, well Davey did it.” I said with a shake of my head. “His dad’s going to be hired at the Ceres restaurant and is being trained to be an Assistant Manager there.” “I hope that works out for him.” Mom said. “So what do we do about this?” Dad asked. “You know him better than us.” “Right now there’s not much we can do.” I said with a shrug. “Except be there for him when he needs support, and make sure that he knows we care about him. He has to make his own decisions and he’ll resist any effort to persuade him differently as long as his mother keeps pushing this.” “We can talk to her, then.” Mom said with a determined look. “She has to see this is not what’s best for Davey.” “She’s even more stubborn than Davey.” I said with a short laugh. “So we’ll just have to wait and see, and be there for David if he needs us.” Dad said and I looked at him with a question in my eyes that he understood. “Brian, I told you once that we felt sorry for him with the bad luck he’s had in life. Since we’ve gotten to know him, both your mother and I have found that we love him like he’s our second son.” “Thanks, dad.” I said with affection. Davey was edgy around me all that night and the next morning, not quite sure about how I would take his decision. I may not have been happy about it, but I knew better than to try to force him to change his mind. Plans could be changed, and nothing about his decision would make my long-range plans untenable, it would just delay them a few years. When he finally realized that I wasn’t going to argue with him about his decisions, he warmed up a little. That afternoon he went with his mother and sister to look at possible places for them to move. His mother wasn’t quite able to drive yet, so he took them in his car. I spent the time doing homework and some chores around the house. Dad got back just after six that night and we sat down for a quiet dinner with just the three of us. We were just finishing when there was a loud knock on the door, and I got up to answer it. “Your parents home, Brian?” Pete Barrow asked with a frown as I opened the door. “We’re just finishing up dinner, Mr. Barrow.” I answered in surprise and he grunted. “Good, I’d like to talk to them, and you I guess.” He said grumpily. “Come in, please.” I replied standing aside and feeling a little glimmer of amusement. Pete was probably as unhappy about things with Davey as we were, and I had a good idea that he was here to try to enlist our aid in changing Davey’s mind, or his mother’s, or both of them. “Pete, what a surprise!” My mom said with delight as we entered the dining room. She got up and gave him a hug as well as a kiss on the cheek. Pete’s face softened at that and he was almost smiling as he turned to shake hands with my father. “It’s nice to see you Brenda.” Pete said and he gave both of my parents a sharp look. “I’d like to talk to you both, and Brian too, if you don’t mind. It’s about Davey and that damn fool of a daughter of mine.” “We’d be happy to talk with you.” Dad said with a smile. “Can I get you anything?” Mom asked. “Coffee, if you have some made.” Pete replied. “I was actually getting ready to make some.” Mom said with a smile. “Why don’t I go ahead and get it started?” “That’ll be fine if it’s no trouble.” Pete replied with a twinkle in his eye. He turned back to my father and a scowl flittered across his face. “I take it Davey’s told you about his mother’s fool idea?” “Yes, he has.” Dad said as Mom went into the kitchen. “I’ve done tried to talk sense into the two of them.” Pete grumped. “They’re both as stubborn as Monta, though.” “Coffee will be ready in just a minute, Pete.” Mom said as he came back into the room and we all sat down at the table. “Thanks, Brenda.” Pete said with a nod. “I don’t see what we can do, but we’ll do anything we can to help David.” Dad said to Pete. “He’s a good young man with a bright future.” “He is that.” Pete agreed. “The problem here is that Sandy and Monta are thinking about what’s best for Sandy and Jenny. That girl is starting to go a bit wild and needs more attention from her mother. What they aren’t doing is thinking about what’s best for Davey. If they did they wouldn’t be trying to drag him back and forcing him to give up his future so that Sandy can feel like she’s got her family again.” “Part of the problem is David’s willingness to put off his future for them as well.” Mom said quietly before getting up to go into the kitchen and prepare the coffee. No one said anything until she came back with a tray of coffee and cups for everyone. “That boy is frustrating sometimes.” Pete said with an explosive exhalation. “He goes and gets his back up when anyone criticizes his father and runs off in a temper, but then the moment Monta or Sandy ask him to do something for them he falls all over himself doing it, no matter what it costs him.” “So the key here is getting Monta and Sandy to change their minds?” Dad asked. “Yes, and that’s what makes it so hard.” Pete explained. “They get a fool idea in their head and they go with it without thinking things through.” “Do you have any ideas on how to change their minds?” Mom asked and Pete shrugged. “We just have to make them see what this’ll cost Davey and make them believe it’s not worth the cost.” Pete shrugged. For the next hour we discussed a few ideas, and it was decided that they’d be tried out when we went over to Pete’s house for dinner later in the week. He’d suggested that Monta should fix us a dinner as a ‘thank you’ for all the help we’d given them, and afterwards Pete would start up a conversation that we all hoped might change their minds. Pete left looking a little less dour than when he’d arrived, and Davey called to say that he’d be staying there in Ceres for the night. I managed to get Davey to go with me to lunch the next day at school. He’d been acting a bit sheepish all day, as if he expected me to be angry, but relaxed as we sat down in the diner we’d driven to in my car. As the waitress brought our plates and we dug in, he lowered his guard. “Did you find a good place yesterday?” I asked as he took a bite of his sandwich. He frowned as he chewed and then swallowed. “Yeah, but the one we can afford best is in Ceres.” He said with a shrug. “It’s only two bedrooms, but it’s affordable. I’d have liked the one in Modesto, but it was just too expensive.” “Even with you working?” I asked him, trying not to show my true feelings about all this. “It sucks, but it’s for the best.” Davey said with a sigh. “Mom wants us all together again, and she’s got a point. We might have been able to afford the bigger place in Modesto, but Janice won’t hire me back.” “Why not?” I asked while frowning at the bitterness in his voice. “I thought they really needed people?” “They did, but after I left she hired two people to replace me and the other restaurant hired someone else as well so they don’t need me to fill in there either.” Davey’s voice was sour, but I tried not to show my smile. “It took them hiring two people to replace you?” I asked him while letting my smile show slightly, hoping he’d not think I was happy he’d not been hired back. “Yeah, well, and then I’d asked her a week ago to help my dad get a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres and they hired him so there’s no job for me there.” Davey grumped, but he did smile a bit at the compliment. “What are you going to do now?” I asked him as I took a bite of my salad. “I heard the Burger King in Ceres was hiring.” He said with a shrug. “Janice said she’d give me a good recommendation.” “Have you thought about doing something besides fast food?” I asked him. “You’ve been doing office work for dad, right?” “Uh huh, but it’s hard to find that kind of job while going to school.” Davey answered with another frown. “We’ll think of something.” I said confidently and the smile came back to his face. “I know you’re probably upset that I’m turning my back on you and your folks after all you’ve done for me.” Davey said a few minutes later after we were mostly done with our food. The waitress refilled our glasses of water while I shook my head. “You’re not turning your back on us.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “They are your family so I understand.” “You sure?” Davey asked and I smiled. “The question is are you sure?” I asked and he frowned at me while sighing and leaning back in the booth. “I’m sure.” Davey said with false bravado in his voice, and under my stare he quickly deflated, sagging against the back of the booth on his side. “Damn it, you know, don’t you? It’s tearing me up inside and I hate this.” “I’m sorry.” I said as I chuckled. The situation was funny, in a way. “What are you laughing at?” He asked sourly. “Sorry, it’s just that it’s weird being on this side of the conversation.” I said and he squinted at me with his blue eyes for a moment. “What do you mean?” He asked. “Let’s just say I remember spending a few decades with a man who knew me at times better than I did.” I said with a shrug. “He knew me from so many other lifetimes that at times it was like I couldn’t fool him no matter how hard I tried.” “Now you know me that way.” Davey said with a slow smile. “Well, yes and no.” I admitted with a shrug. “What do you mean?” Davey asked. “Well, the Davey I knew, he had all the experiences you’ve had, but he’d lived a hundred years since the first time he was seventeen.” I explained. “I knew the person he’d become through all the experiences you’re going through now, and well, you’re already a little different than he was.” “How’s that?” Davey frowned. “Well, by this time, that Davey had already been kicked out of Downey.” I answered softly and almost winced at the frown on his face and the way a little line furrowed between his eyebrows. “Why was I, him, kicked out?” Davey asked. “Because he kept missing classes to work two jobs.” I answered. “He just quit going altogether when he got a promotion at that McDonald’s, and they kicked him out. I remember how embarrassed he was to tell me that they’d transferred his enrollment to a continuation school and he didn’t even know about it until he showed up at school one day after not going for three weeks.” “That must have sucked.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Why’d he do that?” “Because his, your, mother and sister needed the money.” I said with a shrug. “What are you trying to say?” He said with an accusatory tone. “You trying to say I’m about to make the same mistake he did?” “No, I’m just telling you what I know happened.” I replied calmly. Davey upset, as he was now, had to be handled carefully or he’d push back hard. “You are your own person, and your life is already different than his. I don’t know for sure what will happen if you do what you’re talking about now. Davey, remember, this timeline is different than the one I knew, and it’s different already than the one that Davey told me about. Every day we live is part of a new timeline, and I don’t know what’s going to happen with you and me. I know what I want to happen, not what will.” “Why is it always about what other people want from me?” Davey snorted with a look of angst on his face. “What is it you want?” “I want to live my life with you.” I said simply with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “I want to grow old with you, be a part of your life and have me always be a part of yours.” “What if I don’t want that?” He asked and for a moment my heart stopped at the thought. The first few thoughts that came to my head I quickly bit back, and took a deep breath. Davey was watching me closely, and I knew this was an important moment. “Then I’ll have to respect your wishes no matter how much I don’t like it.” I said slowly and he narrowed his eyes. “You won’t try to convince me otherwise?” He said disbelievingly as I snorted. “Of course I will!” I snapped with a bit of irritation. “I’ll make damn sure you know what you’re giving up if you choose to walk away from me, from us, but it’s your damn choice to make no matter what I think about it.” “But don’t you have a say in… this?” He asked me and I looked at him with confusion for a moment before I realized what he was asking. “I made that choice a long time ago from my perspective, Davey Jones.” I told him. “In all those years, I’ve never regretted my choice to live my life with you, either the you I knew before or the you I’m getting to know now.” “I don’t understand it.” Davey admitted softly. “How two men can love each other the way you obviously love me, or him, or both of us, I don’t understand.” “You will.” I assured him and he smiled softly for a moment. “It scares me that I believe you when you say stuff like that, and for a moment I think I can be happy like this, living with another guy.” He said with a heavy sigh. “Then that other voice comes back, and it tells me I’m sinning and I’m going to hell unless I repent, and I think about what happens when Mom, or Dad, or god forbid, Nanny and Papa find out.” “They’ll go berserk at first, but eventually they’ll realize they love you.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “You’ll have fights with them, and then they’ll come around, telling you that they love you no matter what. At first they’ll be standoffish, and then they’ll gradually become more and more accepting until they accept me just as they would have if I was a woman you’d married that they didn’t quite approve of, but that made you happy.” “Like a catholic?” Davey snorted and I laughed. He looked at his watch and frowned. “We better get going. We’re almost late for class.” After school he left to go out with his mother and sister. It was fairly apparent his mother had decided on the Ceres location, and that they were going to do the last bit of paperwork for that. I had a few hours after school, and some time to myself to really think about this, and to make some decisions. When Mom and Dad were both home, I had a long conversation with them and presented my ideas. The timing of everything was fortuitous, and as we drove to Ceres, we made the stop at the convenience store on Yosemite Boulevard. “You sure about this?” Mom asked as she put the little slip of paper in the card we had gotten for Davey’s mother. “Yes.” I assured her. “Aren’t you meddling?” Dad asked as we pulled back onto the road. The airport looked odd without the corporate jet hangars, I noticed with a small corner of my brain. “How does this affect the timeline and your plans?” “It helps Davey, that’s what’s important.” I said firmly. “It keeps things on track with my plans.” “But, how do you know his mother will make the right choices?” Mom asked. “That’s where you come in.” I said firmly. “She needs friends, Mom. You and her got along real well in the last timeline. There’s no reason you shouldn’t get along in this one. You worked for her for a long while there.” “I did?” Mom asked with a frown. “Yes, and you both made a lot of money.” I said with a slight smile. “Mom, she’s been a pastor’s wife since she was out of high school. Along the way she’s held a lot of other jobs, but she was always the wife of a preacher. That made her isolated in a way, from other women her age. I remember Davey talking about how happy he was to see her with so many friends her own age in the last timeline. In a way, that kind of describes his parents. Both of them lived lives that were filled with other people, but they were isolated in one way or another for the most part, at least until the last timeline.” “For some reason that makes some sense.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You both have friends that you do things with all the time.” I pointed out to them. “There are the Rushes, the Walkers, the Bettencourts, and a few others. All friends you’ve had for years and years.” “Speaking of them, what’s going on between Brandon, Trevor, and you?” Mom asked with a little frown as we entered Ceres proper. How many times had I driven this route with Davey in the last time as we visited his mother’s parents, and his father’s mother? The two sets of family literally lived ‘right around the corner’ from each other. Most people would consider it a blessing to have grandparents so close to each other, but I knew from a lifetime of experience that it was both a blessing and a curse. Then again, we’d followed a similar example buying both our Washington and our Modesto homes so close to his and my parents’ homes. My how the boys had loved that, trudging from house to house to get Christmas presents and candy from their different sets of grandparents. It was amazing how spoiled they had been, and yet turned out to be such fine young men. “Brian?” Mom’s voice was concerned as she looked at me in the back seat of the car. “Are you okay? You look like you’re about to cry.” “I was just remembering something about… about the boys.” I murmured softly and she frowned softly, but there was sympathy in her eyes. “How do you deal with that?” She asked me. “I would die if I lost you because I…” “I didn’t lose them.” I said vehemently. “They might be born again in this timeline, but they at least lived long, full lives in the last one.” “But it still hurts.” Mom stated and I nodded. “About Trevor and Brandon.” I said, picking up her question. “They’re just being… teenagers. Don’t worry, it’ll take a little time, but we’ll be back to being friends the way we’ve always been.” “That’s good to hear.” Dad said firmly as we pulled onto Myrtlewood and approached Pete and Monta’s house. Monta answered the door, and we were welcomed inside. Shantill was there, with her infant daughter, as were Davey’s mother, his sister, and one of Jenny’s friends. The house was crowded with all these people, and I couldn’t blame Sandy for wanting to move out. “My, you’re as big as Davey.” Monta said with a bright smile as she tried to push some Kool-Aid into my hand. I took it with a smile. “Thank you, ma’am.” I said with a smile. “Where is he?” “Oh, he got called for a job interview!” Monta said with a smile. “He did?” My voice almost cracked at that, and I noticed how Dad’s face flickered into a frown. Unfortunately, so did Davey’s mom and she frowned as well. There was no doubt in my mind they were frowning for different reasons though. “Yes he did!” Monta said, totally oblivious to the undercurrents in the kitchen and dining room area of her home. Pete was standing in the doorway that separated the area from the living room, and he was frowning as well. “Monta talked to her old shift supervisor at the cannery.” Pete grumbled with an intense look at dad. “She thinks he can get an evening and weekend shift there.” “They pay good, and he can work more during the summer.” Davey’s mother said with a defensive tone. “That was very nice of you to get him an interview.” Dad said to Monta who practically beamed. “Well, he’s a good boy.” She said. “He’s always doing his best for his mother and sister.” “It smells so good in here.” Mom said to change the subject, and Monta went on to tell Mom what she was cooking. “Davey will like going to Ceres next year.” Jenny said as I moved into the family room. It had once been the garage, but Pete had converted it into a huge family room years ago. I noticed Davey’s bed off in the corner and tried not to frown at the idea of him having to sleep down there. “Really?” I said, not quite sure what to make of her tone. This young teenager was nothing like the Jenny Jones I had known in the last timeline. She was an odd mix of adult and childish behaviors. One moment she would be more mature than her age, and then the next a spoiled brat. The Jenny I had known had always been supremely confident, gregarious, and an overall joy to be around. This Jenny would be similar, and then go into a pout, or a fit of rage that I wasn’t sure how to deal with. Tonight she seemed, edgy, almost jealous in a way. “Yeah, so you probably won’t be seeing as much of him.” She said. “That won’t change us being friends.” I said calmly. She frowned and walked away, taking her friend Stacey with her. That was a bit of a relief because Stacey was giving me an all too familiar look through her eyelashes. “Do you know my brother, Christopher?” Shantill asked me as she came into the family room, having left her daughter in Pete’s arms. “He went to Downey didn’t he?” I asked and she smiled with a look very similar to the one Stacey had been giving me. Since I remembered having to dodge roving hands from another Shantill, I made sure to leave as much distance as possible. Luckily, I was saved by Mom calling me to help set the table for Monta. Dinner was nice, even with the undercurrents running through the room. For some reason, it seemed Jenny was jealous of me for the amount of time Davey spent at our house. Stacey and Shantill took turns trying to pass me more food while giving each other murderous looks, and Davey’s mother kept giving my mother and father defensive looks as if she was worried about them looking down on her. “I’m home.” Davey’s voice called out when dinner was almost over, and there was a flurry of activity as Monta got up and set an extra place at the table for him, putting him next to me. “Well, what did he say?” His mother asked after he’d gotten settled. “I’ve got a job starting in two weeks, if school will approve the work permit.” Davey said with a shrug. Monta cheered, as did Jenny and his mother. “Congratulations, Davey.” Dad said after his immediate family had gotten done doing the same thing. “Thanks, Mr. B.” Davey said with a slight smile. “Why does the school have to approve you working there?” His sister asked after a few minutes. “It’s all the heavy machinery.” Davey said with a shrug. “Normally you can’t work there until you’re eighteen, but, well, because of Nanny having worked there, they’ll risk hiring me. I’ll talk the school counselor into it, don’t worry. They pay almost eight dollars an hour! That’s over twice minimum wage. I can get about four hours a night during the week, and then a full day on Saturday and Sunday.” “You’ll have a couple days off a week, won’t you?” Mom asked with a frown. “Um, well, I’ll need all the hours I can get.” Davey said. “I’m sure I’ll get a day or two off every couple of weeks.” “Yes, well, don’t wear yourself out.” Pete said, making a point to draw attention to his left hand. It was missing the two middle fingers. He’d lost them in an accident at a job site when he’d made a stupid mistake because he was working too long and had gotten too tired. “That heavy machinery will suck in a hand, or your arm and chop it right off without a second thought.” “I know, Papa.” Davey said in a long drawl, but there was a look in the back of his eyes that said Pete’s warning had reminded him that bad things could happen. When everyone had finished dinner, we moved into the family room. Monta served coffee for herself, Pete, and Dad. Mom and Davey’s mom were drinking hot tea while Davey and I were having water. Jenny had gone to her friend’s house, and Shantill was on the phone with one of her male friends. The conversation had started casually, with Sandy talking about the house in Ceres that they had applied for earlier that day. “Oh my, it’s time for the drawing!” Monta exclaimed when she noticed the time. She got up and went over to the big screen television, turning it on and changing the channel. “I swear you waste more money on that than I care to imagine!” Pete grumbled before turning to my father. “Both her and Sandy like to play that Lotto junk!” “That reminds me!” Mom said with a slight smile as she dug into her purse. She took out the card we’d signed earlier and that she’d sealed in the car. “Sandy, we are so glad you’re feeling better. We got you this card.” “Thank you, Brenda.” Sandy said with a smile as she opened the envelop just as the lottery drawing came on television. She opened the card as the third ball popped up and the number was called. A slip of paper fell out of the opened card and she bent to pick it up. “A lottery ticket!” “Yes, Davey mentioned how you like to play.” Mom said with a disingenuous smile while Davey gave me a suddenly suspicious look while the fourth ball popped up with its number. “Would you look at that, it’s got all four numbers!” Sandy exclaimed, suddenly on the edge of her seat and looking between the ticket and the television with excitement. “I’ve got none!” Monta called out as she came flying out of her Lazyboy chair to look over Sandy’s shoulder at the lottery ticket. When the fifth number appeared, she started jumping up and down. “That’s five!” “Oh my.” Sandy Jones said softly as the final number appeared on the screen, just as I remembered from another timeline. Sandy and my mother had both bought tickets to that drawing, and I’d joined that timeline’s Davey in teasing them after they’d lost. This time though, Sandy Jones had just won nine million dollars, and was screaming her head off while her son gave me a look filled with suspicion. Chapter 14 “Why’d you do it?” Davey asked me yet again as we stood looking out the window of his bedroom. Below us, his sister and her two friends were hanging over the railing of the back porch, looking at the river churning in the small canyon below. The room was empty, because we were officially just ‘looking’ at the place while his mother contemplated buying the house with her new wealth. “Davey…” I started to say but he shook his head and looked at me with sad eyes. He’d barely spoken to me for the last three weeks, and part of me couldn’t blame him too much for that. “No, Brian.” He said softly. “You didn’t even ask me what I thought. You just did it. What about those people that won the lottery the week after? We took money from them. They were supposed to win all of what Mom got.” “They still won three million.” I said with a sigh. “That’s still a lot of damn money.” “But it’s wrong that you took it away from them and gave it to my mom.” Davey said again, repeating the same thing he’d said last time. “Things would have worked out, you know. I had that job at the cannery and now Mom won’t even let me think about working. She wants me to study and do sports and all that stuff. That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” I answered honestly and he frowned, not expecting me to be so blunt. “That is exactly what I wanted, Davey Jones. I wanted you to be able to concentrate on school, on learning the things to get into a good school where you’ll study the things you need – that we need for the future.” “You did it so I could follow the damn path you’ve laid out for me in your head.” Davey snarled with a look of anger. “I thought you wanted to help me, to help make things better in this world.” I said softly and he frowned. “I do, but I don’t want to cheat in order to do it.” He said in a much softer tone. “Davey, I learned a lot of things in my last life.” I said gently, catching his blue eyes in mine and holding them. It struck me again how his eyes were blue, like mine, but a different shade, and they practically glittered with his emotions at this age in a way that they almost never did in the last timeline. There was still true innocence there, innocence long since gone by the time I’d ever met him. “One of the things I’ve learned is that sometimes you have to take what you need, even if it causes some harm to others. In this case, yes, what I did took money from people who would have gotten more otherwise. Still, they won, and they won a decent amount. Maybe they won’t be able to waste as much of it as they did in the last timeline, but they still got a lot of money. What your family got from it is going to be used to do a lot more than they ever would have done. With it, we’re going to change the world, make it a better place.” “But how does that justify it?” Davey asked. “How can we say we’re good people if we stole that money?” “Davey, I remember the numbers for four lottery drawings in my life.” I said after taking a deep breath. It was time for him to hear this part of my plan. “In five more years, there’s going to be a drawing worth over twenty times what your mother won. We’re going to win that one too.” “Why?” He asked with narrowed eyes and suspicion in his tone. “Because the world doesn’t run on good intentions.” I said with a hint of bitterness in my voice as I looked out the window again. It was strange, I’d had nothing to do with picking this house, but like in the last timeline, Pete had picked it out for Sandy, and she had fallen in love with it at first sight. I was certain she’d buy it, and it was in the Downey district. Even Jenny wasn’t complaining about having to leave Ceres, although she was talking about getting a transfer to let her stay in Ceres High, which was almost certain. She’d have a license soon, and her mother now had plenty of money to get her a car of her own. “What do you mean?” Davey asked me and I sighed. “In the last timeline, your father ran for President, twice, and he won both times.” I said softly and he made a snort. “Yeah, you told me about that.” He said with a hint of scorn. “It won’t happen this time, though. No one is going to vote for a convicted child molester.” “No, you’re right, it won’t happen, but that’s not my point.” I said patiently. “How much do you think he spent on those two campaigns?” “A lot.” Davey said quietly. “Millions of dollars, probably.” “The two campaigns totaled over five hundred million dollars.” I told him and looked back to see his eyes widening and he made a slight coughing noise. “Yeah, your father had to raise half a billion dollars to get, and keep the Presidency. All of his campaigns in total probably came to nearly a billion dollars. Think about that Davey. In the decades after his Presidency, he was widely acknowledged as one of the best presidents in our country’s history. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, not once, not twice, but four times. His acts as President, and later, changed the course of history for this country, and our world. I remember our grandchildren coming home from school, laughing and reading the entry on him from their history books.” “That’s still hard to believe.” Davey said with a whisper and wet eyes. “I can’t believe my father would be so… good.” “But he didn’t become President because he was a good man.” I pushed on. “Sure, that’s part of what got him in office, and made him the great President he was, but this world is as full of good men like your father as it is full of bad, stupid men. Without having the ability to raise that billion dollars for his campaigns, your father might have never been more than a preacher, or a truck driver. In order to change the world, he had to have money to do it. Think about it though, because he took a billion dollars people gave to him, and because of his policies, billions of people lived better lives, and many made more money than they would have otherwise. That billion spent on him yielded results that can never be measured.” “Does it matter?” Davey asked bitterly. “That’s all gone now, destroyed by your time traveling.” “Yes, it does matter.” I said with a sigh. “You may not remember them, no one may remember all those people, but it doesn’t change the fact that they existed or that they had better lives.” “What you’re saying is that it takes money to make things change, to make the world a better place like you want to do, and we have to have that money.” Davey summarized and I smiled while nodding my agreement. “Nine million paid out over twenty years won’t do all that much.” Davey said softly. “No, but a couple hundred million, well around a hundred million after taxes and all that will be enough seed money to make a start.” I said and he nodded. “There are other things, like certain timely investments, that will take that money and turn it into something close to what your father raised for his campaigns.” “So in order to do the good you want to do, we have to take money from others.” Davey said succinctly. “What do most people do when they win the lottery?” “Pay off their bills, quit their jobs, and spend it on themselves or their family, maybe some family friends.” I said with a shrug. “We’re going to do more than that though. You and I, if you want, we will change this world like your father did, although I hope to make it last longer than he did.” “How did he fail to do that?” Davey asked and I smiled. “Cult of personality.” I answered and he frowned. “Huh?” He stated. “It’s something I first learned in college.” I said with a shrug. “Okay, maybe I heard Davey and his father talking about it in high school, but they were discussing Ronald Reagan. But, when I learned it in college was when Davey and I first really started discussing it in the context of our national political history.” “So you’re saying I need to go to school to learn about this?” Davey asked with a slight chuckle. “Yes.” I answered him honestly and he nodded. “I still don’t like it.” He sighed. “You don’t have to like it.” I said with a shrug. “Most of the time I don’t like it either, taking money from people like this, but it is necessary.” “How did you get so… jaded?” Davey asked and I had to laugh. “I’m not jaded compared to some people.” I shrugged and he gave me that look that I now knew to mean he was thinking about time travel. “How did I get so jaded?” He asked softly. “You already know the answer to that.” I replied and he stared at me for a long moment before nodding slowly. “Oh, good, you’re both up here.” Sandy Jones said from the doorway to Davey’s room. My mother was right behind her, and both of them were smiling. “What do you think, Davey? Is this place good enough?” “I love it Mom.” Davey said with a gentle smile. “It’s like we were meant to live here.” That bastard! He said that on purpose, since I’d already told him the history of the house in the last timeline. It was all I could do to not burst out in laughter. “What do you think Brian?” She asked and I had to take a deep breath before answering. “I like it a lot.” I answered her. “Good, then I’ll let Dad haggle with the realtor and get the price down a bit.” She said before turning and walking away with a determined stride. “She’s happy.” Davey smiled softly. “No matter what else, this is making her happy, and your mother… why did they turn down half the money?” “We don’t need millions of dollars.” I said with a shrug. “Besides, our moms are talking about going into business together and your mom is providing most of the start-up funds for that.” “True.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “If I didn’t believe you already, I’d believe you came from the future now. Wait, I just thought of something. You said the timeline was already changing. Aren’t you worried the cumulative effects of the changes you’re making will change the lottery numbers of that big jackpot you want to win?” “Nope.” I answered confidently. “Why not?” He asked. “I don’t understand the physics myself, and I know you’re not much on the mathematics.” I semi-answered and he frowned, but didn’t protest. It was true, even after a hundred years of life, Davey was mediocre at best with math. “What it comes down to is that changes can effect the world in a lot of ways, but certain events are largely unchanged unless there’s something really massive that happens. Random events, like the random drawing of the lottery numbers stays random. If you want to change them, your best bet would be to change things so the lottery is outlawed and the drawing never held, for example.” “Or start World War Three and get everything nuked.” Davey said with a slow nod of his head and I nodded my agreement. “Yep, like that.” I agreed. “In some weird way it makes sense.” Davey said with a smile. “So, did I hear right, that the last game of the baseball season is this weekend?” “Yeah.” I answered the question easily. He often did that, totally change tracks when he felt a particular topic had been fully discussed. “I think I’ll go.” Davey said and I laughed.",

      "content": "“What is it, Katie?” I asked her in a short tone of voice. “Marcie’s spreading it around school that you got her pregnant.” Katie said in a hushed voice. “It takes two to tango, and we still don’t know which guy was dancing with her when she got bit.” I said and Katie actually snorted as if she was holding back a laugh. “That’s not quite true.” She said in a quiet voice. “The day you broke up with her, you remember, after that New Year’s party?” “Yes.” I answered. “She was complaining that she’d gotten pissy with you because she was on her period.” Katie said. “Then she asked to borrow a pad from me because she was out.” “If she was having her period after the last time we had sex…” I said with a sudden swelling of hope inside me. I’d been right; even if she was pregnant there was no way it was mine! “I… what she’s doing is wrong.” Katie said. “She’s fixated on you like a bitch in heat but it’s obvious you want nothing to do with her and she’s trying to trap you. It’s wrong. I’m sorry, you should know, but I won’t admit it if you tell anyone. Her little brother’s already threatened to beat me up if I mentioned it to anyone.” “Her little brother knows?” I asked in surprise. “She really is pregnant, Brian.” Katie said in a rush. “It’s just not yours. Too bad for you your family has more money than any of the other guys she’s fooled around with, so they’re going after you to get what money you guys have.” “Her entire family knows?” I said incredulously while she nodded. “Just remember I didn’t tell you any of this!” She said in a rush before turning and heading away at a very quick walk. “You couldn’t pay me enough to have your life, Breckenridge.” Coach Cole’s voice said from behind me and I turned to see him walking around the side of the gym. “You heard?” I asked him and he nodded. “Let’s go in my office and talk.” He suggested and I nodded before following him inside. I’d been continuing with the NJROTC two times a week and had even got a reluctant Davey to join. When he had shut the door and we were seated in his office, he shook his head. “So your ex-girlfriend is trying to trap you into marrying her?” “Something like that, yeah.” I said and told him the whole story from the message on the answering machine to the explosive meeting at my house. I even found myself telling him how Davey had left and not come back. “Hm.” He said with a chuckle. “You and Davey, I didn’t see that one coming.” “I–we–we’re not…” I started to protest but he waved me off. “Breckenridge, I’ve seen the way he looks at you during practice and I wasn’t born yesterday.” Cole was nearly chuckling. “I won’t say I’m exactly comfortable with it, but let’s just say that I got use to turning a blind eye at times in the Navy and I see nothing wrong with continuing that here. You aren’t the only two boys I’ve seen making eyes at each other in this gym.” “I bet.” I said while thinking of Trevor and Brandon who seemed to be developing more and more of a relationship with each other. That surprised me, at least on Trevor’s part since he’d always grown out of his man-on-man attraction by college and gone off to marry a girl, at least according to Davey he’d done that in every other timeline. “Well I’m not going to name names, but let’s get back to your ex.” Cole said with a shake of his head. “What are you going to do about her?” “Call her a slut and demand a paternity test.” I answered. “That was always the plan but after that little conversation you overheard, it’s sounding even better since the paternity test will end the issue forever.” “Six or seven months is a long time, Breckenridge.” Cole reminded me. “A lot can happen in that time and if people start believing her, it won’t matter what the paternity test says, they’ll still believe it’s your kid.” “I know.” I said with a shrug. “That’s where calling her a slut comes into play. Enough people believe she’s a slut and nothing she says will stick, and every guy who has ever fucked her will go scurrying for cover and repeat that she’s a slut just to keep people from thinking it might be theirs.” “Breckenridge, I’m never going to play poker with you.” He said with a laugh after thinking what I’d said over. “You’re ruthless.” “When I have to be, I can be.” I said with a slight smile that I knew looked wicked on me and he shivered visibly. “I’ve learned from the best.” “Who is that?” He asked and I shrugged, realizing I really shouldn’t have said that last part. I’d learned ruthlessness from Davey Jones, but a different Davey Jones than the one he knew. When I didn’t answer, he changed subjects. “Have you given thought to what you might be doing to this baby before it’s even born? Maybe about how your rumor campaign might affect it’s life?” “Nothing I could do would make it any worse for a kid born into that conniving bunch that Marcie calls a family.” I said angrily. “You have a point.” Cole agreed with a nod. “It’s getting close to time for school to start.” “Thanks for the talk, coach.” I said as I stood up to leave. “Not a problem.” Cole said dismissively as I left his office and wondered if I could find Davey before first period. Davey managed to elude me most of the day, mostly because I kept on getting stopped by people to ask if it was true that I’d gotten Marcie pregnant. Most of them had reacted with shock at the blunt way I called her a slut and until the baby was born God was the only one who could possibly know whose kid it really was. Her little brother confronted me at lunchtime, furious that I was calling his sister a slut, and probably more upset that so many people believed that claim. Before he could take a swing at me, Brandon and Trevor had restrained him and I walked away before a teacher could notice. He didn’t bother me after that, and my friends were chuckling at the way the rumors were spreading like wildfire. Marcie had fired her salvo, trying to pin her pregnancy on me, but the day wasn’t even half over before people were starting to form betting pools on who the real father was. During the last P.E. period, I heard Adam turn to Davey and ask him who he was betting for the real father of Marcie’s baby. Davey’s face was a look in priceless shock when he didn’t hear my name on the list at all. “What about Brian?” Davey asked in a sharp tone and a scathing look at me. “Didn’t he sleep with her too?” “Yeah, but he’s probably the only one smart enough to use a condom with a slut like that.” Adam laughed and Davey looked at me with a calculating look. “Your mom said you wanted to talk to them and me after school.” Davey said later, during a slow moment in baseball practice. “I’d like to, yes.” I said softly, not wanting to say anything that could upset him at this point. “Do you think the kid’s yours?” He asked me icily. “I know it’s not.” I said with conviction. “How do you know that?” He asked. “My parents deserve to hear it at the same time as you, and you deserve to hear it at the same time they do.” I told him with a voice that quivered a bit. “You’re just as important to me as they are.” “Am I?” Davey asked and I nodded. “I’ll be there.” He said and walked off while I breathed a sigh of relief. Davey followed me home from practice, and I was in such a hurry that I didn’t even bother to change out of my practice uniform before taking off. Davey had to hurry to catch up before I pulled out of the parking lot, and I noticed him watching my butt as I walked to my car. I’d had these particular practice pants since I was a freshman, and they were tight on me. It’d be a cold day in hell before I admitted to him that I’d worn them today on purpose, knowing how he liked looking at me in tight clothes. Dad was home as we pulled up, having stayed in Modesto and worked from home most of the day. Mom was there and while she frowned at the fact that I hadn’t changed, she noted that I was at least carrying my cleats instead of wearing them inside. I took just enough time to put them up in my room before hurrying back to the living room and sitting down on the towel she’d put on the couch. My uniform wasn’t that dirty, but it wasn’t worth mentioning at this point. “Davey, thanks for being here.” I said to Davey first, who was sitting on the far end of the couch but looking at me steadily while my parents sat on the loveseat and watched me. “Mom, Dad, first off I should thank you too for supporting me in this. It’s not over yet, and it won’t be until we get that… that girl to take a paternity test. The really good news is that when we get that paternity test we’ll be out of this mess.” “You’re sure about that?” Mom asked with concern in her voice. “I am now.” I assured her. “One of Marcie’s former friends told me in secret that the day she broke up with me, after the last time we – we had intercourse – Marcie was having her period and borrowed a pad from her. There’s no way the baby could be mine.” “Could this girl be lying to you?” Dad asked. “She could, but I doubt that’s the case.” I answered. “She has no reason to lie to me, it’s not helpful to Marcie, and well, she also let it slip that Marcie’s little brother was threatening her if she told anyone. It seems like Marcie’s entire family is in on this.” “I’ve taken two calls from her father today, and the last time he threatened to burn our house down if we don’t make you marry her.” Dad said with a frown. “I am so glad to hear there’s no real chance the kid’s yours. The thought of there being any relation between us and them is distasteful. Now that you’re certain, I’m going to report his threats to the police.” “You are?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow as he scooted a little closer to me on the couch. I think no one missed that gesture, and Mom smiled. “Of course I am.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “If they are threatening my family, I’ll take whatever steps I can to protect them, including calling the police.” “You want to be careful with that.” Davey said sadly. “Sometimes, when you do that, the press can get involved. Maybe I shouldn’t spend so much time here, if they get wind of my name and threats against you, they’d definitely jump on the story and I don’t want to put you folks through that. You’ve done too much for me as it is.” “You’re going nowhere young man.” Dad said firmly and with a hint of anger in his voice. “If that happens, we’ll deal with it but I won’t run you off because of a possibility of a story or two in the local rag.” “You don’t know what it’s like.” Davey murmured, but he also looked relieved that dad was insisting he stay. “Davey, we know you and your family well enough now to have some idea.” Mom said while meeting his gaze. “We’re not worried about that. We can deal with it, and we’re not ashamed of you, or of Brian.” “Nor would we be ashamed of either of you, or both of you, if that ever came out either.” Dad said and Davey’s hiss of indrawn breath filled the room and he looked at me with terror in his eyes while Dad actually laughed. So did Mom, and Davey started to relax when he realized they weren’t mocking him, or us. I reached out and took his hand, and at first he resisted, but when I persisted he exhaled and gripped my hand with a death grip. “Believe me when I say we’d rather have you as part of our family than the alternatives.” Mom said and then she frowned. “That didn’t come out quite right. I wouldn’t want you to think I was comparing you to that… girl. There is no comparison, really. For starters, we actually like you whether you’re a part of Brian’s life or not.” “How did you know?” He asked in a weak voice and his hand was shaking as it grasped mine so tightly it hurt. He relaxed a bit as I moved my hands so that our fingers were entwined in a more comfortable grip. “Next time you spend the night in Brian’s room, you should open the window and air out the room.” Dad laughed and Mom blushed, although Davey’s cheeks were rosier than hers. “I don’t think we’ll… I mean… oh fuck, I give up.” Davey murmured and Dad laughed. “You know my parents would be having fits at just the thought and I’m here holding Brian’s hand and you’re laughing at us! It’s not fair! I’m not prepared for this!” “Would you rather we tried to break you up?” Mom asked through her laughter. “No.” Davey said softly as he squeezed my hand and turned to look at me before sliding closer to me, close enough to lean against me. “Are we still together after the way I just ran out on you when you probably needed me?” “Don’t worry about that.” I assured him. “You’re here now.” “Yes, well do we have anymore to discuss or should I start dinner?” Mom asked and I let out a sigh of my own. “You better order a pizza or Chinese.” I told her and she frowned. “That was the easy stuff to discuss.” “The easy stuff?” Dad asked with a hint of horror in his voice and he frowned at my nod. “If that’s the easy stuff, I think maybe we should wait until after we eat.” “No.” I said with a hint of pleading in my voice. “If you make me wait, I think I’ll lose my nerve to tell you, all of you?” “Brian, don’t tell me you’ve killed someone.” Mom said with genuine horror in her voice. “No mom, I haven’t killed anyone in the last fifty years.” I assured her, and transitioned into the real purpose of this little family meeting. “I didn’t have a choice then; the Iraqis had attacked our convoy and were trying to take hostages. Davey was the one who picked up a rifle from a fallen Iraqi Army soldier and started fighting back. I just followed his lead.” “You’re not making any sense.” Dad said with a wild look in his eyes while Davey stared at me like I’d gone crazy. “What are you saying?” “Don’t tell me you’re another Mr. Shelton.” Davey groaned, referencing a seventh grade World History teacher at La Loma. Deranged Mr. Shelton believed in reincarnation and would launch into fanciful stories about having lived through the Black Death in medieval Europe. “No, I’m not talking about reincarnation.” I answered Davey while my parents were starting to look like I’d cracked and gone insane on them. “Although, the more I think about it, reincarnation is damn close, except it’s not being reborn into a whole new life, except in this case it kind of is, but not really.” “Brian, you’re not making sense.” Dad said sternly. “What are you going on about?” “Mr. Shelton was a teacher at La Loma.” Davey started to explain. “I remember the man.” Dad said sharply. “I’m asking what the hell it is Brian’s trying to tell us and failing at so miserably.” “Sorry, it’s really complicated and I’m nervous.” I said in all honesty and realized my hand was shaking slightly in Davey’s. He squeezed it in a comforting gesture and I relaxed a bit. These were my parents and Davey. I’d planned this out while I tossed and turned last night, I knew how to approach this logically, I just needed to calm down. “Why don’t you start at the beginning, then?” Dad suggested and I nodded, taking a deep breath and preparing to begin. “The bottom line of the story is that time travel is more than just possible, it’s a reality.” I said in a much calmer breath, ignoring the looks of continued confusion on their faces or the hiss of indrawn breath from Davey. He’d always been a fan of science fiction and was probably better suited to understanding this than my parents. “In the year 2004 of the original timeline, which is this time we’re in right now, a scientist conducted an experiment that would send the memories, the consciousness if you will, of a person back in time to his younger self.” “And you’re this time traveler.” Davey asked, grasping the idea and for the moment at least, he appeared to be withholding his disbelief. My parents were looking at me like I was crazy. “No, that first time traveler was you, Davey.” I told him and his eyes widened and he looked at me like I was crazy. “I don’t remember anything about the future.” He said quietly. “No you wouldn’t, because we jammed that before it could happen.” I stated. “The thing you have to understand about time travel is that cause and effect can happen simultaneously, or effect preceding cause. In this case, when I came back in time, it was 2054 and we sent a signal that jammed any other transmission that would send a person’s memories back in time.” “Huh?” Dad asked with wide eyes and an incredulous expression. “Are you trying to say you’re eighty-five years old?” Mom asked in a breathy voice. “No, I have the memories of eighty-five years of life in another timeline, but it’s a very different timeline than this one.” I said. “Let’s go back to the beginning on this.” Dad said in an exasperated voice. “It all started in 2004 of this timeline.” I repeated. “A scientist in Livermore built the first working time machine and he tested it out on a man named Davey Jones. Davey traveled back in time, or at least his memories and consciousness traveled back in time, and he woke up in his twelve-year old body on August 1st of 1981.” “This is for real, not a joke?” Dad demanded and I nodded. His sat back in the loveseat and weakly waved a hand for me to on. “Davey thought something had gone wrong with the experiment.” I continued. “He had been told he’d only be able to see events from his young perspective. Instead he found he was in full control of his body, and as days turned into weeks, he realized that he was there to stay. At first he tried to keep from changing anything, but on the first day of the seventh grade he ended up becoming friends with a guy named Brian Breckenridge and two others named Brandon and Trevor.” “You weren’t friends with him back then.” Mom said astutely. “Not in the original timeline, but when he went back in time and made the first change, Davey created a new timeline, what we call Timeline Two.” I explained and she nodded almost as if she was following this explanation. Davey was getting it from the look in his eyes. “I bet I tried to stop my dad from molesting my sister.” Davey said in a weak voice. “That was one of the modest goals that Davey set when he realized he could change the timeline without destroying the universe.” I agreed. “Along the way it was discovered that other time travelers had come back in time and the government found out about Davey.” “Oh shit, I bet that wasn’t good.” Davey said stolidly and Dad shook his head. “What’d they do?” Mom asked as she leaned forward. “Fortunately for Davey, he’d made good friends, and one of those friend’s father had good connections.” I continued. “You see, Mr. Rush, Trevor’s father, he’s not really what he seems.” “Is he another time traveler?” Dad asked. “No, he’s a Soviet defector.” I said and Dad’s eyes widened while mother covered her mouth with a hand. “You’re kidding!” Mom gasped. “No, I’m serious, although I guess you could try to confirm that.” I said with a shrug. “I don’t know how they’d react in this timeline, but eventually it becomes more public knowledge after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” “The Soviet Union collapses?” Dad asked in shock and I chuckled. Davey had said that was the one fact that always made the biggest impact on people in the 1980’s. No one thought the massive juggernaut that was the evil Soviet Union could possibly collapse in on itself like it had so many times in history. “It did in the original timeline and several other timelines except the one where they went to war to keep it from happening.” I said. “How many of these timelines are there?” Davey asked. “This would be Timeline Four if you counted just the timelines created by Davey Jones going back in time.” I answered and he looked surprised. “Most of us call it Timeline Five though because Sean Rule came back to save Davey at the end of Timeline Two when the Soviets sank his ship during that timeline’s World War Three.” “What?” Mom nearly shrieked. “I know that name.” Davey said with a frown. “Didn’t he go to school with us?” “Mighty convenient.” Dad said skeptically. “Sean’s the one who picked Davey as a test subject in the first experiment.” I explained and Dad shook his head. “Two other men went back into that first Timeline. One of them was the scientist who created the device, but he died in an accident. The other was a pro-Soviet Russian who wanted to keep the Soviet Union from collapsing. He almost succeeded, but he was forced into open warfare against the United States. By that time, Davey was a known time traveler, at least by President Reagan and his close advisors. He fought in the Navy during that Timeline’s World War Three. At first, he died when his ship sunk, but Sean Rule came back in time to help him.” “How did that happen if the timeline changed when that Davey went back?” Mom asked and I was surprised at how intuitively she understood this. “The time machine creates a bubble in sub-space that lasts as long as the time machine has power.” I answered her question. “Sean Rule was the last person alive in that bubble and he used the machine’s last bit of power to go back far enough in time to warn the President, who issued orders that saved the original Davey Jones from death and ended World War Three.” “That would deserve a ‘and they lived happily ever after, but they didn’t, did they?” Mom asked and I smiled. “Davey and that timeline’s Brian lived together as a couple for a long time.” I half-answered her question as Davey squeezed my hand. There was a small smile on his face. “So what happened next?” Dad asked as he leaned forward, looking interested. “In Timeline Two’s 2004, a war broke out with mainland China and Taiwan.” I continued my story and was relieved that they were at least listening instead of calling for the men with the straight jackets. “Admiral Davey Jones led US naval forces in the area to a crushing defeat of the attempted Chinese invasion, but the entire war was a diversion. They had kidnapped Sean Rule, the only person who had a working knowledge of how to build a time machine and used him to complete their own time machine. They held his partner, Brandon Walker, and Davey Jones’s partner Brian, hostage. Davey led a SEAL team into the facility but he was too late to stop a Chinese agent from going back in time. He was mortally wounded in the gunfight and went back in time again before he died from his wounds.” “Jesus, it’s like a good sci-fi story.” Davey commented uneasily. “I’m not sure who you think I am but that Davey Jones sounds a bit like Superman.” “No, he wasn’t Superman.” I said with a fond smile on my face. “He was just damn close to the real thing. He knew what he thought was right and he fought for it tooth and nail, and he was damn smart. You have to remember, by that 2004 he had over six decades of life experience behind him but he was only in his early thirties.” “That would be… interesting.” Dad said softly. “Hold on just a minute while I get us some food.” Mom said standing quickly and we sat in silence, just staring at each other until she returned with a tray of fruit, cheeses, and crackers as well as a pitcher of ice tea and four glasses. While everyone munched down, I continued the story, taking them through what I knew of that horrible timeline, Timeline Three and its ending in nuclear annihilation of most of the Earth. “It’s like a love story.” Mom said with tears bristling in her eyes when I recounted the death of my other self from that timeline. I had to agree with her, it was both supremely tragic and awful sweet at the same time. “It’s a sick love story.” Dad said, but he was smirking a bit. “So our intrepid hero Davey Jones goes back once more, right? Does his trusty sidekick Sean go back too?” “Yeah, he does, after a fashion.” I said with a smile at that description of Sean who no one here except Davey had ever met. “This time, Davey ended up back in 1976 instead of the early 1980’s.” “Wait, before or after we moved back from Florida?” Davey said with excitement. “After, but boy did Davey make some changes in that timeline.” I continued. “His seven-year old body couldn’t handle the memories of an adult nearly a hundred, so the brain began to shut down after a short while. Before it did, he really made some big-ass changes.” “Like what?” Davey asked with a light in his eyes. “He got his grandfather to place a few key bets, winning a heck of a lot of money.” I said. “He used that to manipulate his dad into giving up preaching and running for the State Assembly.” “You’re kidding!” Davey exclaimed. “No, and for a while Davey went into a coma while his brain returned to its normal seven-year old function, but Davey had set up a system where he was able to warn key people about big problems that were coming up.” I continued with a wistful expression on my face. “Some of those changes included an early warning about AIDS, and it saved Uncle Rich’s life.” “Oh my.” Mom said as tears came to her eyes and Dad put a comforting hand on her leg. She leaned into him for a bit of support. “Yes, well, eventually Davey’s brain matured enough that his ‘older’ self woke up again, and he set more changes into place.” I continued. “His father went from a member of the California Assembly to a member of the President’s cabinet and ended up the Secretary of Agriculture. Davey and Brian were friends for several years before they started dating.” “And dad, he never…” Davey’s voice faltered, unable to speak the question. “No, Davey’s sister was never molested, and she ended up being a fighter pilot in the Air Force and one of the highest ranking female combat veterans in the history of the Armed Forces.” I answered and he shook his head in disbelief before a smile appeared on his face. “It sounds like paradise.” Davey whispered. “I haven’t even mentioned that David Jones Sr. eventually became President in that timeline, the timeline I was born in.” I said softly and Dad snorted in disbelief. “You almost had me going there, Brian.” Dad said. “You should write this down and sell it.” “I’m being serious, dad.” I said. “I was born in that timeline, Timeline Four.” “Then why are you here now?” Mom asked and I smiled sadly. “I assume you and that super-Davey lived a long happy life together?” “We did, with two kids, half a dozen grandkids and dozens of great-grandkids.” I answered and Davey squeezed my hand at those words. “We had a family together?” Davey asked and I smiled at him. “I told you it was possible the other night.” I reminded him and he nodded after a moment. “So what happened?” Mom asked. “Terrorists, probably a Dhu Ghal branch from Ireland managed to get a dirty bomb into Washington D.C.” I answered her question and she looked confused. “That’s a super-long story, but Dhu Ghal was an Irish separatist movement that started after the European Common cracked down on member states. The United States helped them at first, giving them weapons because the EC was trashing the US economy. Then they reached an agreement with the EC and they abandoned Dhu Ghal. When that happened, Dhu Ghal decided to teach the US a lesson and set off a dirty bomb they’d gotten from our country. Washington D.C. was irradiated by deadly amounts of radiation, poisoning most of Congress. “Every President since David Jones Sr. had been made aware of Project Do Over. Davey and Sean had built a time machine, just in case it was ever needed, and President White authorized a Do Over. Sean and I, the only two with the codes who could activate the machine used it to do two things.” “What happened to me, to the Davey who’d gone back all those other times, I mean.” Davey asked and I sighed. “He had a stroke before the bomb went off and couldn’t help out.” I said feeling the grief at that memory well up inside of me, and my voice shook as I spoke. The comforting grip of his hand reassured me though and I blinked away the tears from my eyes. “I loved him, but he couldn’t help, so I went with Sean to activate the time machine. The first thing we did was set off a jamming device that Sean and Brandon came up with over the years. It effectively wiped out the other time travelers and reset the timeline to the original one, the one that would have progressed if time travel had never been invented.” “Then why did you come back?” Dad asked with his eyebrows furrowed. “It seems to me if you took the trouble to undo time travel you’d have left it at that.” “It seems terrorism is a bigger threat than we had imagined.” I said and Dad’s frown deepened. “Then why come back this far again?” Mom asked. “To give me time to think about the problem, and work towards a fix.” I explained. “It’s not something that can change with just a bit of knowledge, but it’s going to take a lifetime, at least, so we went as far back as we had the power to go. I’m sorry Davey, I’d have come back further to stop what happened to your sister if I could.” “I believe that.” Davey said simply, and his trust bolstered my confidence. “What happened to the Brian of this timeline?” Dad asked and I sighed. This was the question I feared the most. “When I came back, his memories were overwritten in favor of mine.” I said. “But you are our son, our Brian.” Mom asked. “Yes and no.” I answered. “You see, much of this timeline, it’s very similar to Davey’s original timeline, although now there are differences since I came back. In that original timeline, Davey and Brian were never friends. I’m pretty sure the original Brian married Marcie and had kids with her. Our lives were mostly the same though, except for the time that Davey struck me out in little league when we were real young, and then later when we became friends in junior high. That never happened here, of course.” “This is confusing.” Dad said simply, but he looked me in the eyes for several minutes before continuing. “You are, but you aren’t quite our son is what you’re saying. It wasn’t you who dated and… and slept with Marcie.” “That’s correct.” I answered. “I think we need some time to think this over.” Dad said softly and I stood up. “You should know, there are some differences in the parents I knew from the last timeline and you, but there aren’t many. You’re as much my parents as they were, and I’m as much your son as the Brian who was here before I came back that night in January. I think you can figure out which night it was.” I said in a rush. “That’s one thing I understand about this.” Dad said softly. “Just give us a few minutes, please, son?” “Okay, dad.” I said with a sigh of relief that he still thought of me as his son. Davey followed me as I went to my bedroom, and he shut the door behind me. I was too scared to turn around and look in his eyes. That wasn’t necessary, though, because he stepped up behind me and wrapped his arms around me, his hands rubbing my crotch through my practice pants. “Dude, that’s some fucking story.” He said as he nibbled on my neck. “What are you doing?” I asked him with a little surprise. “Taking advantage of your old ass.” Davey joked and I turned around in his grasp with surprise writ in large letters across my face. “You’re not…you’re not like grossed out or anything?” I asked him with surprise. When I’d been in his shoes it had taken me days to adjust to this news. “Dude, we’re like star-crossed lovers who chase each other across time.” Davey said with a wicked smile as he pecked at my lips. “If there’s anything that could be more fucking romantic or reassuring that we’re meant to be, I don’t know what it could possibly be. It’s like after hearing that story I know we’re meant to be together and I could care less who knows. Do you know how hot you look dressed like this? You drove me fucking crazy all afternoon and now, now I just don’t care. It’s like I can say whatever I want because nothing can come between us and I know this is what we’re meant to be, together.” “Kiss me.” I growled, not quite understanding his logic, but agreeing we were meant to be together. In another time, it had taken me days to realize that very same thing. Once again, Davey had proven just how much smarter than he was than I. He was also one hell of a kisser, I realized yet again as I came perilously close to an orgasm just from him kissing me. Nothing else really mattered in the end, I was here, with Davey, and together nothing could stop us. Nothing. Chapter 12 Davey and I did little more than kiss and grope each other a bit before my parents knocked on the door to tell us that dinner had been ordered. Davey sighed as I mentioned that I was going to take a shower and get changed, but he gave me one final kiss before leaving the room. When I was showered and changed, the conversation continued while we ate Chinese. “We’ve reached the conclusion that our son is either very deranged, or something we can’t quite understand has happened.” Dad said as we all filled our plates with the food. He and Mom looked worn out already, and Mom had a sad expression on her face. “What we don’t understand is, if this is true, what happened to our Brian.” Mom said quietly, moving the food around on her plate without taking a bite. “I am ‘your’ Brian.” I answered emphatically. “The only difference is that I have more memories than I did before January, and I’ve lost a few memories. Everything else about me is the same.” “I don’t think that’s quite accurate.” Dad said with a frown and a significant look at Davey. “I’ll be blunt about this.” I said firmly, catching the eyes of both of them before continuing. “I’ve always been bi-sexual, attracted to both guys and girls. Before January, I might have allowed myself to believe that Marcie was the girl I loved, but I know better now.” “How do you know that?” Davey asked, speaking up after hurriedly swallowing a bite of chow mien. “I’m not the same Davey Jones you fell in love with in that other timeline.” “Yes, you are.” I said passionately. “You may not have all the memories that he had, but you are the same person.” “That just doesn’t make sense.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “Our experiences are part of who we are as people.” “Mom, is Dad the same person you married?” I asked her pointedly. “Is he exactly the same as he was when you met him and fell in love?” “No, and that’s my point.” Mom argued. “It’s the experiences we’ve had since we got married that make us who we are today. How can you say you’re our son when you don’t have the memories of us, the memories he should have from the time he was born?” “I do have most of the same memories.” I countered. “My life in this timeline and in my original timeline was much the same, except for a few minor events. They didn’t start to differ at all until 1981.” “But that’s five years of changed memories.” Mom asserted. “You’re not him, and I want to understand what happened to him.” “He’s here, in me, and I’m in him.” I argued. “We’re one and the same. It’s like I’ve got amnesia of those years, and memories of other years.” “I don’t know if I can accept that.” Mom muttered. “It’s like my son died and was replaced by an imposter.” “Do you remember when we visited Uncle Rich back in ’78?” I asked her. “We got into that argument and I stormed out of Uncle Rich’s apartment. You spent two hours driving around San Francisco looking for me and I was in the back seat of the car the entire time. You hit a light pole when I sat up in the back seat and asked what you were doing.” “You remember that?” Mom asked with wide eyes. “I told you, I am your son!” I stated emphatically. “It’s just that I have slightly different memories of a few years.” There was silence around the table while everyone picked at their food. Nearly twenty minutes passed before anyone spoke again. “So how old are you?” Dad asked, breaking the long silence. “Are you in your eighties or are you seventeen?” “I’m seventeen with a lot more memories than your average seventeen-year-old.” I answered. “ “You said your timeline was different from this one, but that there’s a lot of things the same.” Davey said next. “When the Challenger blew up, you said it was something wrong with the O-rings on the booster. Is that how you knew, because it blew up in your timeline?” “No, it never blew up.” I shrugged. “It blew up in the original timeline that Davey was from. In nearly every subsequent timeline he managed to stop it from happening, and a few other events from happening as well. Other things, like earthquakes, hurricanes, and some wars happened anyway.” “You said you came back because terrorism threatened the future of this timeline.” Dad said slowly, as if he was thinking each word over carefully before speaking. How are you going to do something about that if you won’t let the government know about you?” “It’ll take time, and making sure I’m in the right position to advise the right people at the right time.” I answered. “I had decades of conversations with time traveler Davey, and with Sean as well. Before he had his stroke, Davey reached the conclusion that stopping a single event, or a series of events might change subsequent events, but they alone don’t change history for the better and usually the changes end up being for the worse.” “Why is that?” Mom asked. “Because you’re right in that our experiences, our memories make us who we are as time goes by.” I said. “If you stop too many of the horrors from happening, people forget about the dangers of certain things, and they get reckless. It’s like a kid who’s never been burned seeing a huge bonfire as a young adult and not realizing he can’t stick his hands in the fire without getting burned.” “I’m not sure I understand that.” Dad said and I let out a sigh. “It’s not easy to grasp right away.” I replied. “The fact is that the Challenger accident brought about much needed reforms. With Davey’s shortcut to helping stop it from happening, NASA didn’t learn the lessons it needed to learn and we ended up losing two more shuttles to accidents by the end of the 1990’s. In the end, what we theorized was that what needed to be changed weren’t specific events, but our understanding and learning from those events. In many ways, we need to have our bubble pricked and learn some hard lessons.” “Like what?” Dad asked. “Do you really want a deep political/philosophical discussion right now about international relations and the short-sightedness of our current social-economical system?” I asked while arching my eyebrow. “Not right now, no.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “Good, because I do have school in the morning.” I laughed. “Aren’t you finding school boring?” Mom asked me. “I mean, you’ve been through school already, and probably college, right?” “I’ve been through high school, college, law school, and gone back for two doctorates as well.” I answered and Dad snorted. “You went to law school?” Dad asked and I nodded while he shook his head. “Figures you wanted a lawyer to deal with Ellsworth and his daughter.” “God, I’d be bored if I had to go back through high school.” Davey muttered. “It’s not the most exciting thing in the world, except I do enjoy sports, and NJROTC, and all the other stuff that goes along with school.” I said with a shrug and Davey looked at me like I was crazy. “Besides, if I want to go to college again, I’ll need a high school diploma and they won’t just hand me one if I ask because I’m a time traveler.” “No, I guess they wouldn’t.” Mom said with a slight smile. For the next few hours, all three of them peppered me with questions about my life in the other timeline, and I could see the wariness and distrust fading from their eyes as I answered the questions. Several times my parents asked me questions that required answers slightly different than answers I’d previously given. It was obvious they were trying to delve into the truth of this situation as much as possible by trying to uncover any inconsistencies they could. What food remained uneaten had long since grown cold by the time dad yawned and stretched. “I think I’ve heard enough.” Dad said with a long look at Mom first and then at me. “At this point, I have to admit that as crazy as it sounds, I believe you. I’m still not sure how I feel about everything, but I’m ready to sleep on it.” “Thank you.” I said and stood up. “If you don’t mind, I’ll call it a night now. There’s school in the morning, and I have a test in English.” “I’ll be back in a minute to help clean everything up.” Davey said as he stood to follow me out. He led the way to my bedroom but stopped outside the door and looked at me with a slightly worried expression. “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “I’m wondering about you and me, and all this.” Davey said softly, looking into my eyes as if hunting for a lifeline. “I mean, I know you think we’re meant to be together, and it sounds like a dream come true. But I can’t help but feel it’s wrong.” “What’s wrong?” I asked him. “You, me, the whole sex thing.” He said softly. “I guess I can’t lie to you, you’re not the first guy I’ve had sex with, but I’ve always thought it was wrong; something not to be thought about, much less discussed. Until you, I didn’t even think it was possible to really feel love for another guy, I thought it was just about sex and girls were who you fell in love with.” “I know.” I said sympathetically and he smirked. “Of course you know, it’s me who doesn’t know.” He said softly. “I want it to be true, that you and I can live together and love each other, but I don’t know if I can.” “Take it one day, one moment at a time.” I suggested. “You came back twice and sought me out, and you were right to do that. The thing is, it was me who was where you were at right now, except I never really expressed it to him in words. Davey, the other you, the one with all those memories, he was so confident about us when I knew him. Still, he took his time with me, let me reach the decision that I loved him and wanted him, and he gave me time to work out my issues with the whole time travel crap.” “What did you do?” He asked. “It took me days to reach the decision you did earlier tonight.” I said with a shrug and he smiled. “I’ve always known you’re smarter than I am.” “No I’m not.” Davey demurred. “I wonder though, when you look at me, do you see me or do you see him? Do you love me because of him?” “You are him.” I asserted. “I said it earlier and I meant what I said. The only difference between you and the Davey I spent a lifetime with is that he had more memories than you do right now. As far as I can see, you are, at your core, the same person that he was, and it is those qualities that attract me to you, no matter what memories you do or do not possess.” “So you see both of us?” He asked and I couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s one thing I’ve always loved about you Davey Jones.” I said softly, reaching out and caressing his right arm. “You are quick on your feet and figure things out so much quicker than I ever could hope to do.” “Stop that.” He said with blushing cheeks and I leaned in to kiss him on the cheek. Davey pulled me into a hug before releasing me and turning to head back into the dining room. I got ready for bed, and although I should have been unable to sleep, as soon as I lay down on the bed, I was asleep. The next morning I woke up to icy water being dribbled on my face. Davey actually giggled as he scampered out of my room while I sat up in bed spluttering with indignation. The sun was barely touching the mountains in the east, but I found Davey in the kitchen wearing a sweat suit that mom had bought him the other day. It was really nice cotton pants in a dark blue and a gray hooded sweatshirt. “It’s about time you got up, old man.” He teased me and I realized I was in for a lot of payback for all the times I called him ‘old man’ in the last timeline. Still, the fact that he was taking it so well made me feel good inside. “I thought we’d just go for a run from here instead of going to the school.” “You’re really getting into this exercise stuff, aren’t you?” I asked him and he shrugged while blushing slightly over his orange juice. “I feel better after.” He said with another shrug. “Besides, it’s something we do that’s just the two of us. I like that.” “So do I.” I said warmly, getting my own glass of orange juice. I’d put on a pair of sweatpants that were a lighter blue than his, so after downing the juice, I went back to my room to finish getting dressed. We were now doing a good three miles on the morning runs, and at a decent pace without even having to stop for a walk. Davey was inordinately proud of that little fact, and when we got home to find Mom in the kitchen, he gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek before heading off to the shower, calling his dibs on first use of the bathroom. “He’s in a good mood.” Mom said after he’d left. There was a bit of tension in the air, and while I filled a glass of water, she gave me a long look before letting out a sigh. “You doing okay?” I asked her. “Yes, Brian, I am.” She answered. “I think I’m going to be okay with what you’ve told us. I look at you and you look no different, except for maybe the way you carry yourself. I hadn’t realized it before, but you’ve been a lot more confident without that arrogant pose I’d gotten used to seeing. You are different, but in all the important things I think you’re still my Brian.” “I’m glad to hear that, Mom.” I said earnestly. “How much does this change things?” She asked. “Do you expect to be treated like an adult now?” “Well, I am almost seventeen.” I replied with a smile and she chuckled. “In other words, I’m your son and I’ll always be your son. You’ll always be my mother, Dad will always be my father. Our relationship will change as the years go by, but no matter what else, I’m physically seventeen and I’m living under your roof.” “You had kids in that other timeline, right?” She asked even though we’d gone over that several times last night. “Yes, two boys.” I replied. “Do you think you’ll want kids in the future?” She asked me with a wistful look on her face. “I know you said people’s opinions on gays as parents change, but will you go through having kids again? It must have hurt a lot to leave them behind like that.” “I miss them a lot, but the truth is they were probably injured or killed when the dirty bomb went off.” I said with a slight shrug. “There wasn’t much time to think about that while Sean and I were getting ready to do our duty, but I’ve grieved over them the last couple of months here, and I’ve realized there wasn’t much I could do for them. As for kids in the future, more than likely we will, if Davey still wants them.” “Does he?” Mom asked. “Probably.” I said with a shrug. “Everything’s too new right now for us to have talked about it much.” “I guess so.” She replied and then got a worried look on her face. “Doesn’t the age difference bother you? Every time I think about it I get a little uncomfortable.” “I’m seventeen, mom.” I reminded her. “Sure I have more memories, but that doesn’t make it all that different. I remember being old, sure, but the body really does affect the brain as well as the brain affecting the body. I’m not in my eighties anymore, and I know that.” “Still, couldn’t you use your knowledge to influence him in a bad way?” Mom asked with a worried tone. “I could, but I won’t.” I said with a shrug. “In our relationship, I might have opened the door for him, but I didn’t trick him into walking through it, he did that on his own.” “I did what on my own?” Davey asked as he came into the room with his shaggy hair still wet, but he was wearing a newer pair of jeans and a sleeveless light blue OP shirt with a hood. The shirt showed off his much more slender body, and his arms that were starting to develop some good muscle. I had to turn away from Mom so she wouldn’t see the reaction, but a glance back showed her smothering a laugh. “Fall for this big guy here.” Mom said and Davey blushed while looking down at the table. “What will you boys have for breakfast?” “Cereal please.” Davey said and mom proceeded to get him a bowl. “I’ll have some too when I finish showering.” I said. “Davey, I hope you left me some hot water.” “Nope.” He said with a smarmy grin and I cuffed him up the side of the head before scooting out of the kitchen. Marcie wasn’t in school that day, to the relief of many, and it seemed that the furor over her paternity allegations was already dying down to be replaced by sniggers about her being a slut. I almost felt bad for her as I realized that she’d be shunned for the rest of her high school career, but in the end she’d deserved what she’d gotten. She’d gambled on her future and lost badly. As the days, and then the weeks progressed, things evened out and life became downright pleasant for the most part. Davey and I both took the ASVAB test in late March, just before spring break. Talk about ‘time travel’ became infrequent as he and my parents saw that I was much the same person they’d known and they grew accustomed to the concept that I just had a few extra memories rolling around in my head. Davey’s mother ended up having to go through detox after she recovered from her surgery because they’d given her too much morphine and she’d grown addicted to the stuff. Davey took his sister to visit her every weekend, and I even went with them a couple of time. Monta stayed up there, living in Uncle Rich’s old apartment and turning up her lip every time she saw a gay couple, but other than a few comments about Davey and I ‘being careful’ when we were up there, she didn’t say much. The biggest change was Dad’s business venture. They landed a few big clients right off the bat, and as a result he ended up being gone for most of each week, and even occasionally over the weekends. We all missed him, but Mom was especially lonely, and I wasn’t surprised when she ended up going to see him a couple of days a week. Most of the stuff she was doing was charity work, and she didn’t need to be in town all week. Davey and I didn’t mind since he liked to make love in all sorts of interesting places. That was one of the biggest differences for me to adjust to in this timeline. The Davey I’d known had been a passionate, skilled lover, but he’d been very discreet. Most of the time we’d made love it had been in a bed, behind closed doors and curtains. This Davey found the most amazing places to unbutton my pants, including in the mornings on the way to school, in the gym shower after baseball practice when he’d purposely delayed me so the rest of the team had already left, the backyard of the house after a friendly wrestling match, and along the canal bank during an early morning run. He wasn’t the only one doing the seducing though. I knew him very well, and I had to admit that a young sex drive, and having Davey in my reach again made me very horny. Barely an hour went by when I wasn’t thinking about the next time Davey and I would have sex, and I did my best to get him back for all the times he’d ambush me, pulling down my pants before I could protest. Davey got turned on by a lot of things, and chief among them were tight clothes. Whether it was me in my baseball uniform, or just wearing a particularly tight pair of jeans and a tight t-shirt, I could see his eyes glaze over whenever I wore something form-fitting. Male birds were often very colorful in order to attract a mate, and I knew that clothing always attracted Davey like few other things could. In the last timeline, when his family could afford nice clothes, I’d never quite understood why what I wore could have such an impact on his lust, but having seen the poor clothing that his family could afford in this timeline, I understood this aspect of him better. The Davey of that timeline had been a product of a rather poor family, and the effects of that had stayed with him from his original childhood. “I’m going to rip those pants off you later.” That was something I heard almost every day from Davey, usually as a hushed whisper as we walked from one class to the next, and every time I’d shiver in anticipation of that happening. Almost always he did manage to rip them off of me, and I knew better than to change out of whatever clothing had turned him on so much, rather waiting to let him peel them off of me. He enjoyed it nearly as much as I did. Dad joined us to go fishing with Pete during the middle of March on a Saturday. Davey was surprised at how good of an experience it was, with all of us catching several fish (including Davey actually catching his first one despite all the times he’d gone fishing with Pete as a kid). His grandfather seemed to have lightened up a bit, and barely even complained about paying off Davey’s car or continuing to make his car insurance payments. My relationship wasn’t just about sex with Davey, and although he usually went to his own room and slept in his own bed, we usually spent an hour or two in my room, just cuddling together on my bed while we talked quietly. He had a lot of questions, ranging from how to accept being gay and in a relationship to discussions about the last timeline, and what I had planned for this timeline. Most of the time he just listened, but as the days went by, he started proposing some of his own ideas, or critiquing mine in a way that showed me he really was thinking through my ideas, and that he was willing to be with me through the whole thing, taking an active part in what I hoped would be a productive change for the world. The Monday a week before the start of Spring Break, we all sat in the dining room after dinner for a talk about what we would do for the break. Normally my family went on a trip somewhere for a few days, and my parents would tell me where we were going at this time, having kept it as a surprise while they made their plans. “Boys, we’d planned for a trip to Los Angeles this year, including you, David.” Dad said when we were finished helping Mom with the dishes. “Unfortunately I have a business meeting next week that I have to attend so we’ve had to cancel our plans.” “I understand.” Davey said with a sigh. “Thanks for including me in the plans though.” “You’re as much a part of this family as Brian, David.” Mom said with a smile and a long look at him. He blushed but didn’t protest. “As for what we’re going to do next week, Dad’s having to travel for his meeting so we’re going with him for the entire week instead of just a couple of days. His work will pay for his airfare, and we’ve gotten a good deal for the rest of us and for our hotel rooms. You boys won’t mind sharing a room will you?” “No.” Davey said with another blush and she laughed. “Where are we going?” I asked. “Hawaii.” Dad said with a broad smile and my face lit up as did Davey’s. “Is this something to do with the Grayson merger?” Davey asked after we’d smiled at each other. Since he still did a bunch of typing for dad, it figures he’d have some idea what was going on in Dad’s business. “Yes.” Dad said and he had a proud smile on his face. I was pretty sure that Davey had been showing much more interest in dad’s work than I was, and Dad seemed to appreciate that. He and Davey had really bonded the longer that Davey stayed with us. “Would you like to come along to the meetings?” “I’d like that.” Davey said with a broad smile that my father returned. The last week of school before break flew by as we prepared for our trip. Davey blushed when we went to the sporting good store and I insisted that he buy a Speedo for the trip, but he did buy it, and he made sure that I bought one as well. Brandon, Trevor, and Todd (who was beginning to hang out with us more) were all jealous of our getting to go to Hawaii. Davey’s sister pouted for a day or two, but since she was going to Memphis with her friend’s family, she wasn’t too upset. The only real snag came up when Davey visited his mother the day before we were to leave. At first she said she wouldn’t let him go, but Monta stepped in and told her she was being selfish. Davey and I wisely left the hospital room while Monta proceeded to chew Sandy out about her trying to hold her son back from having fun just because she was stuck in the hospital. When we came back into the hospital room twenty minutes later, she grudgingly gave her permission for Davey to go. It had been a long flight to Hawaii, but Davey was full of energy and passion when we finally got checked into our hotel. Hawaii is three hours behind California in time, so it was late afternoon when we got there, and I spent the hours before dinner with Davey, breaking in our hotel room’s bed. I’d have to remember to leave a tip for the maids because our bed was a mess by the time we got dressed for dinner, and I was walking a little bit funny, hoping my parents would chalk it up to all the sitting during the long flight out here. On Monday while Davey went to some meeting with my father, I was dragged out for shopping with my mother. All things considered, there were worse ways to spend the day than shopping in Honolulu. I even managed to pick up another Speedo for Davey, pitch black with gray stripes, while mom arranged for surfing lessons that Davey and I could take the next couple of days. That meant we also had to get short wet suits for the surfing lesson, and my mouth watered at the thought of Davey wearing one of them. When he tried it on later that night in the hotel room, I hoped the maids cleaning our room were at least mollified by the large tip I’d leave them in the morning. Davey didn’t seem to mind, although he wasn’t quite sure about surfing. We spent Tuesday morning learning to surf before he returned to the hotel room to get dressed for a meeting that he was going to with Dad. During the lesson, I’d noticed one of the other guys that was learning to surf with us talking to Davey, and Davey flirting back a bit. That got me jealous, and Davey noticed the jealousy with a little smirk that oddly enough set me at ease. Davey turning down the guy’s suggestion of meeting up later in the week for some ‘practice’ made me feel even better. The week in Hawaii passed quickly for all of us, and I had to admit that I felt a lot more relaxed than I had been. School had been getting very hectic the last couple of weeks with mid-terms and preparing for the ASVAB. I also had a make-up testing of the SAT tests coming up in April, but during the trip I was able to not worry about that. Instead, I soaked up the sun with Davey, wiped out while trying to surf, went snorkeling in Hanama Bay, and we all went to a luau on Thursday night. Friday was our last full day since we were flying out early Saturday morning, and I’d talked my parents into letting Davey and I go off by ourselves. I didn’t tell Davey where we were going, and he watched me anxiously as we took a series of buses to get to our destination. It was still fairly early in the morning, just a little past nine, and we both wore shorts over our Speedos, and tight white t-shirts. We’d packed our snorkeling gear into two bags that we carried, and from that Davey had figured we were going to a beach, but hadn’t figured out anything else. When we got to the beach I’d picked out, I was glad to see that it was still fairly empty. Together we picked out a spot, put down our towels, took off our shorts, donned our snorkeling gear and headed out into the water. Davey was wearing the new black Speedo with gray stripes while I was wearing a red pair that I knew he really, really liked. There weren’t all that many schools of fish around where we snorkeled, and we ended up playing tag in the water, chasing each other over and under the waves tagging each other on the butt and then swimming off as we were chased. We did that for nearly two hours before we were both tired enough to head back up to the beach. It was nearing noon, and the beach was crowded with people as we waded back up out of the water, carrying our flippers in one hand and snorkel masks in the other. Davey stopped cold as he looked around at the crowded beach and turned to me with wide eyes. “This is why you picked this place.” He said with a little half-grin. “Yes.” I said, moving the mask to the hand with the flippers and reaching out to put my arm around him in public. He stiffened slightly at the touch, but relaxed against me a moment later and we walked back to our towels like that. As we walked there were many guys looking at us, some with lust in their eyes, some with sly smiles, and others with friendly looks on their face. Davey kept staring at them, and when we passed two guys that were so busy kissing each other that they didn’t see us go by, I could feel Davey’s body relax. When we laid down on our towels, dropping our gear, he scooted over so that he was firmly against my side and leaned in to kiss my ear. “I love you Brian.” Davey said softly and I looked up to see tears in his eyes as he looked at me before looking around. “I thought I was going to freak out the first time you and I walked around the Castro. Most of those were just too weird, but here, it’s no different than the other beaches we went to this week except it’s almost all guys.” “I thought you should see this before we go.” I said with a smile as I also looked around. “Do you think they’d freak out if we fucked right here?” Davey asked with a vivacious leer that caused a swelling in my Speedos. Instinctively I moved my hand to cover my crotch, but I decided to tease Davey instead and let him see the lump growing there. “They’d probably just take pictures or try to join in and then you’d be put in jail.” I said with a shrug. “But if you want, I won’t stop you.” “It’d suck going to jail for having sex with my boyfriend.” Davey joked. “Who said anything for going to jail over having public sex with me?” I joked back and he looked confused until I finished the statement. “You’d go to jail for starting a riot after I refused to let anyone but me touch you.” “Har har, very funny.” Davey said as he swatted my arm and laid back on his towel, stretching out to soak up some sun. I did the same, and felt a little thrill as his hand found mine and we entwined our fingers while soaking up the warm Hawaiian sun. Life was good, damn good. Chapter 13 “Guess whose moving back to town?” Todd asked as he spotted me while I did my presses. We were in my backyard. Davey’s mom had come home last week, and he was helping her get settled. Monta had come back with her after having been gone for nearly three months from her own home, and had thrown a fit at the condition of her house. Jenny was back from staying with her friend, and was resenting having to once again share a room with her mother. Sandy was doing much better, and the extra time in the hospital while she got over the morphine addiction had actually given her extra time for intensive physical therapy that had her on the verge of being ready to go back to work instead of having weeks more of physical therapy. “Who?” I asked Todd as I finished the set. Todd still came over two times a week to work out with us on the weight set, and was becoming a better friend with each passing week. “Sean Rule.” He said with a grin and I was glad I’d just put the weights back on their holder because I would have dropped them otherwise. “You’re kidding; I thought he and his family lived down south.” I said, trying not to show exactly how excited I was by the news. “Yeah, well I just heard they’re moving back here over the summer.” Todd said. “I remember what you said about wanting to apologize to him for what you did back in freshman year, and now you’re going to get your chance. Don’t worry, I’ll put in a good word for you beforehand.” “Thanks.” I said sardonically. “Okay, let’s get these set up for me.” Todd said, changing the subject. “I’m not a big fucking ape like you and Davey.” “Well at least you’re no longer a pee-wee.” I said as I stood up and wrapped my hand around his biceps. He was definitely more toned there. “Hey, hands off the merchandise or I’ll tell my best friend you’re playing around on him.” Todd teased, having already figured out Davey and I, of course his catching us making out one day in the garage helped him put two and two together. “You’re just jealous.” I teased him back as we took off some of the weights for him to do his own set. “Damn right I’m jealous, I should have had Davey.” Todd smirked. There was just enough bitterness in his voice that I knew he was partially serious, but the look in his eyes also told me that he was resigned to the fact that Davey was mine. That was a good thing, Todd was a good guy and I’d hate to have to set him straight on how things stood. “Who wouldn’t be?” I said instead of something harsher and he chuckled before lying back on the bench and getting ready for his sets. Forty minutes later he was driving off in his beetle and I took my third shower of the day to clean off the sweat from our workout. Davey came home after dinner, and one look at his face had me worried. His eyes were red and puffy. “What’s wrong, honey?” Mom asked as soon as she saw him enter the living room where we were watching television with Dad who’d actually gotten home earlier than normal. “I… it’s my mom.” Davey stammered and mom was up off the couch and hugging him before guiding him over to sit next to me. His hand found mine and clasped it tightly. “What’s wrong?” Dad asked. “I thought she was home from the hospital?” “She is.” Davey sniffed, barely holding back the tears. “That’s what’s wrong.” “What do you mean?” Mom asked while putting a hand on his shoulder. “She… she’s already got a job lined up for as soon as the doctor clears her for work.” Davey sniffed again. “She’ll start in a couple of weeks and as soon as she does, she wants to move out of Nanny’s.” “Shouldn’t that be a good thing?” I asked with a frown. “It is.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “The only problem is that she wants me to move back in with her.” “Dear, she’s your mother; of course she wants her children home with her.” Mom said gently and Davey shook his head. “That’s the thing, she’s not sure where we’re going to move.” Davey moaned softly. “Jenny wants to stay at Ceres High, that’s where all her friends are, and if mom gets a place in Ceres, that means I have to go to Ceres as well and I don’t want to go to that stupid school. Mom’s considering moving into a place in Downey’s district, but Jenny’s dead-set against it and I can’t make mom choose me over Jenny. It wouldn’t be right, I mean my sister’s been through so much – more than me – and she deserves to go to the school where her friends are.” “So do you.” I said with a firm clasp of his hand in mine and he sighed. “It wouldn’t matter anyway, because if she moved into Downey’s district it would be more expensive than the housing in Ceres.” Davey said with a sigh. “Either way, she won’t make enough money on her own, and Dad’s barely making enough to pay Grandma Jones the rent she charges him for staying with her. That means I’ll have to get a real job.” “You already do work for me, that is a real job.” Dad said and Davey let out a bark of laughter. “I’m sorry, Dad B.” Davey said. He’d started calling Dad that after the Hawaii trip and my father still smiled every time he heard Davey say it, even now. “I don’t mean that it’s not a real job just that I don’t make as much money doing it like I did at McDonald’s. Sure, I make more per hour, but I had a lot more hours and Mom will need that money to make rent and pay for food and all that.” “What about your after-school activities and the stuff we’ve already planned for the summer?” I asked him and he frowned. “I’m sorry, Brian, but I’m just not going to be able to do all that.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and a shake of his head. “Mom needs the extra money and I need to help her and Jenny first, before anything else. It just wouldn’t be right for me to do otherwise.” “What about college, David?” Dad asked while I contemplated Davey. His mouth was set in a determined way that I knew all too well. He’d made up his mind, and right now there would be no moving him. He did grimace at dad’s question though. “I can go to MJC part-time after I finish high school next year.” Davey said after a moment of thinking. He looked over at me sympathetically. “I know you wanted me to go to school with you, Brian, but you understand, don’t you? After Jenny graduates, mom won’t need my help anymore and then I can go meet you wherever you’re going to school. Credits from MJC will transfer, right?” “Yes, they will.” I said with a sigh. “Are you sure about this? Davey I know you want to help them but is it worth the cost to yourself?” “Of course it is.” Davey snorted indignantly. “If that’s your decision, that’s your decision.” Dad said with a note of finality. “We’re going to miss having you around here, son.” “I’ll still be around.” Davey said with a sad smile. “I mean, it’s not like I’m breaking up with Brian, and I really do appreciate everything you have all done for me so I’ll be here whenever I can get away.” “You’re at least going to finish the year at Downey, right?” Mom asked. “Yeah, and if we’re lucky, Mom will pick the place in Modesto so I can still go there.” Davey said with a little smile. “We can always continue using Nanny’s address for Jenny so she can go to Ceres, and either Mom or I can take her there in the mornings.” “That would be good.” I said and squeezed Davey’s hand again. “I’ve got some homework to do now if you don’t mind.” Davey said as he stood up. Both Mom and Dad gave him a hug before he went into his bedroom and I was left in the living room with my parents. “What do you think, Brian?” Dad asked me softly when Davey was gone to his bedroom. “He’s set on doing this.” I said with a shrug. “He obviously doesn’t like it, but he thinks it is the right thing to do, and he’ll do anything for his mother and sister.” “Even after what his mother did when she brought him back to California?” Mom asked. I’d told her that part of the story and she’d been furious for most of that night. “Even after that.” I answered her question. “Davey’s very forgiving when it comes to those he loves. You know he went to talk to his father last week, right?” “He didn’t tell us that.” Dad said with surprise. “What happened?” “His father was trying to make a go at selling medical equipment but the company folded.” I explained. “The man’s desperate for a job, and he asked Davey’s help in getting a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres.” “Ouch.” Dad winced. “That must be hard for both of them.” “Yeah, well Davey did it.” I said with a shake of my head. “His dad’s going to be hired at the Ceres restaurant and is being trained to be an Assistant Manager there.” “I hope that works out for him.” Mom said. “So what do we do about this?” Dad asked. “You know him better than us.” “Right now there’s not much we can do.” I said with a shrug. “Except be there for him when he needs support, and make sure that he knows we care about him. He has to make his own decisions and he’ll resist any effort to persuade him differently as long as his mother keeps pushing this.” “We can talk to her, then.” Mom said with a determined look. “She has to see this is not what’s best for Davey.” “She’s even more stubborn than Davey.” I said with a short laugh. “So we’ll just have to wait and see, and be there for David if he needs us.” Dad said and I looked at him with a question in my eyes that he understood. “Brian, I told you once that we felt sorry for him with the bad luck he’s had in life. Since we’ve gotten to know him, both your mother and I have found that we love him like he’s our second son.” “Thanks, dad.” I said with affection. Davey was edgy around me all that night and the next morning, not quite sure about how I would take his decision. I may not have been happy about it, but I knew better than to try to force him to change his mind. Plans could be changed, and nothing about his decision would make my long-range plans untenable, it would just delay them a few years. When he finally realized that I wasn’t going to argue with him about his decisions, he warmed up a little. That afternoon he went with his mother and sister to look at possible places for them to move. His mother wasn’t quite able to drive yet, so he took them in his car. I spent the time doing homework and some chores around the house. Dad got back just after six that night and we sat down for a quiet dinner with just the three of us. We were just finishing when there was a loud knock on the door, and I got up to answer it. “Your parents home, Brian?” Pete Barrow asked with a frown as I opened the door. “We’re just finishing up dinner, Mr. Barrow.” I answered in surprise and he grunted. “Good, I’d like to talk to them, and you I guess.” He said grumpily. “Come in, please.” I replied standing aside and feeling a little glimmer of amusement. Pete was probably as unhappy about things with Davey as we were, and I had a good idea that he was here to try to enlist our aid in changing Davey’s mind, or his mother’s, or both of them. “Pete, what a surprise!” My mom said with delight as we entered the dining room. She got up and gave him a hug as well as a kiss on the cheek. Pete’s face softened at that and he was almost smiling as he turned to shake hands with my father. “It’s nice to see you Brenda.” Pete said and he gave both of my parents a sharp look. “I’d like to talk to you both, and Brian too, if you don’t mind. It’s about Davey and that damn fool of a daughter of mine.” “We’d be happy to talk with you.” Dad said with a smile. “Can I get you anything?” Mom asked. “Coffee, if you have some made.” Pete replied. “I was actually getting ready to make some.” Mom said with a smile. “Why don’t I go ahead and get it started?” “That’ll be fine if it’s no trouble.” Pete replied with a twinkle in his eye. He turned back to my father and a scowl flittered across his face. “I take it Davey’s told you about his mother’s fool idea?” “Yes, he has.” Dad said as Mom went into the kitchen. “I’ve done tried to talk sense into the two of them.” Pete grumped. “They’re both as stubborn as Monta, though.” “Coffee will be ready in just a minute, Pete.” Mom said as he came back into the room and we all sat down at the table. “Thanks, Brenda.” Pete said with a nod. “I don’t see what we can do, but we’ll do anything we can to help David.” Dad said to Pete. “He’s a good young man with a bright future.” “He is that.” Pete agreed. “The problem here is that Sandy and Monta are thinking about what’s best for Sandy and Jenny. That girl is starting to go a bit wild and needs more attention from her mother. What they aren’t doing is thinking about what’s best for Davey. If they did they wouldn’t be trying to drag him back and forcing him to give up his future so that Sandy can feel like she’s got her family again.” “Part of the problem is David’s willingness to put off his future for them as well.” Mom said quietly before getting up to go into the kitchen and prepare the coffee. No one said anything until she came back with a tray of coffee and cups for everyone. “That boy is frustrating sometimes.” Pete said with an explosive exhalation. “He goes and gets his back up when anyone criticizes his father and runs off in a temper, but then the moment Monta or Sandy ask him to do something for them he falls all over himself doing it, no matter what it costs him.” “So the key here is getting Monta and Sandy to change their minds?” Dad asked. “Yes, and that’s what makes it so hard.” Pete explained. “They get a fool idea in their head and they go with it without thinking things through.” “Do you have any ideas on how to change their minds?” Mom asked and Pete shrugged. “We just have to make them see what this’ll cost Davey and make them believe it’s not worth the cost.” Pete shrugged. For the next hour we discussed a few ideas, and it was decided that they’d be tried out when we went over to Pete’s house for dinner later in the week. He’d suggested that Monta should fix us a dinner as a ‘thank you’ for all the help we’d given them, and afterwards Pete would start up a conversation that we all hoped might change their minds. Pete left looking a little less dour than when he’d arrived, and Davey called to say that he’d be staying there in Ceres for the night. I managed to get Davey to go with me to lunch the next day at school. He’d been acting a bit sheepish all day, as if he expected me to be angry, but relaxed as we sat down in the diner we’d driven to in my car. As the waitress brought our plates and we dug in, he lowered his guard. “Did you find a good place yesterday?” I asked as he took a bite of his sandwich. He frowned as he chewed and then swallowed. “Yeah, but the one we can afford best is in Ceres.” He said with a shrug. “It’s only two bedrooms, but it’s affordable. I’d have liked the one in Modesto, but it was just too expensive.” “Even with you working?” I asked him, trying not to show my true feelings about all this. “It sucks, but it’s for the best.” Davey said with a sigh. “Mom wants us all together again, and she’s got a point. We might have been able to afford the bigger place in Modesto, but Janice won’t hire me back.” “Why not?” I asked while frowning at the bitterness in his voice. “I thought they really needed people?” “They did, but after I left she hired two people to replace me and the other restaurant hired someone else as well so they don’t need me to fill in there either.” Davey’s voice was sour, but I tried not to show my smile. “It took them hiring two people to replace you?” I asked him while letting my smile show slightly, hoping he’d not think I was happy he’d not been hired back. “Yeah, well, and then I’d asked her a week ago to help my dad get a job at the McDonald’s in Ceres and they hired him so there’s no job for me there.” Davey grumped, but he did smile a bit at the compliment. “What are you going to do now?” I asked him as I took a bite of my salad. “I heard the Burger King in Ceres was hiring.” He said with a shrug. “Janice said she’d give me a good recommendation.” “Have you thought about doing something besides fast food?” I asked him. “You’ve been doing office work for dad, right?” “Uh huh, but it’s hard to find that kind of job while going to school.” Davey answered with another frown. “We’ll think of something.” I said confidently and the smile came back to his face. “I know you’re probably upset that I’m turning my back on you and your folks after all you’ve done for me.” Davey said a few minutes later after we were mostly done with our food. The waitress refilled our glasses of water while I shook my head. “You’re not turning your back on us.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “They are your family so I understand.” “You sure?” Davey asked and I smiled. “The question is are you sure?” I asked and he frowned at me while sighing and leaning back in the booth. “I’m sure.” Davey said with false bravado in his voice, and under my stare he quickly deflated, sagging against the back of the booth on his side. “Damn it, you know, don’t you? It’s tearing me up inside and I hate this.” “I’m sorry.” I said as I chuckled. The situation was funny, in a way. “What are you laughing at?” He asked sourly. “Sorry, it’s just that it’s weird being on this side of the conversation.” I said and he squinted at me with his blue eyes for a moment. “What do you mean?” He asked. “Let’s just say I remember spending a few decades with a man who knew me at times better than I did.” I said with a shrug. “He knew me from so many other lifetimes that at times it was like I couldn’t fool him no matter how hard I tried.” “Now you know me that way.” Davey said with a slow smile. “Well, yes and no.” I admitted with a shrug. “What do you mean?” Davey asked. “Well, the Davey I knew, he had all the experiences you’ve had, but he’d lived a hundred years since the first time he was seventeen.” I explained. “I knew the person he’d become through all the experiences you’re going through now, and well, you’re already a little different than he was.” “How’s that?” Davey frowned. “Well, by this time, that Davey had already been kicked out of Downey.” I answered softly and almost winced at the frown on his face and the way a little line furrowed between his eyebrows. “Why was I, him, kicked out?” Davey asked. “Because he kept missing classes to work two jobs.” I answered. “He just quit going altogether when he got a promotion at that McDonald’s, and they kicked him out. I remember how embarrassed he was to tell me that they’d transferred his enrollment to a continuation school and he didn’t even know about it until he showed up at school one day after not going for three weeks.” “That must have sucked.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “Why’d he do that?” “Because his, your, mother and sister needed the money.” I said with a shrug. “What are you trying to say?” He said with an accusatory tone. “You trying to say I’m about to make the same mistake he did?” “No, I’m just telling you what I know happened.” I replied calmly. Davey upset, as he was now, had to be handled carefully or he’d push back hard. “You are your own person, and your life is already different than his. I don’t know for sure what will happen if you do what you’re talking about now. Davey, remember, this timeline is different than the one I knew, and it’s different already than the one that Davey told me about. Every day we live is part of a new timeline, and I don’t know what’s going to happen with you and me. I know what I want to happen, not what will.” “Why is it always about what other people want from me?” Davey snorted with a look of angst on his face. “What is it you want?” “I want to live my life with you.” I said simply with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “I want to grow old with you, be a part of your life and have me always be a part of yours.” “What if I don’t want that?” He asked and for a moment my heart stopped at the thought. The first few thoughts that came to my head I quickly bit back, and took a deep breath. Davey was watching me closely, and I knew this was an important moment. “Then I’ll have to respect your wishes no matter how much I don’t like it.” I said slowly and he narrowed his eyes. “You won’t try to convince me otherwise?” He said disbelievingly as I snorted. “Of course I will!” I snapped with a bit of irritation. “I’ll make damn sure you know what you’re giving up if you choose to walk away from me, from us, but it’s your damn choice to make no matter what I think about it.” “But don’t you have a say in… this?” He asked me and I looked at him with confusion for a moment before I realized what he was asking. “I made that choice a long time ago from my perspective, Davey Jones.” I told him. “In all those years, I’ve never regretted my choice to live my life with you, either the you I knew before or the you I’m getting to know now.” “I don’t understand it.” Davey admitted softly. “How two men can love each other the way you obviously love me, or him, or both of us, I don’t understand.” “You will.” I assured him and he smiled softly for a moment. “It scares me that I believe you when you say stuff like that, and for a moment I think I can be happy like this, living with another guy.” He said with a heavy sigh. “Then that other voice comes back, and it tells me I’m sinning and I’m going to hell unless I repent, and I think about what happens when Mom, or Dad, or god forbid, Nanny and Papa find out.” “They’ll go berserk at first, but eventually they’ll realize they love you.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders. “You’ll have fights with them, and then they’ll come around, telling you that they love you no matter what. At first they’ll be standoffish, and then they’ll gradually become more and more accepting until they accept me just as they would have if I was a woman you’d married that they didn’t quite approve of, but that made you happy.” “Like a catholic?” Davey snorted and I laughed. He looked at his watch and frowned. “We better get going. We’re almost late for class.” After school he left to go out with his mother and sister. It was fairly apparent his mother had decided on the Ceres location, and that they were going to do the last bit of paperwork for that. I had a few hours after school, and some time to myself to really think about this, and to make some decisions. When Mom and Dad were both home, I had a long conversation with them and presented my ideas. The timing of everything was fortuitous, and as we drove to Ceres, we made the stop at the convenience store on Yosemite Boulevard. “You sure about this?” Mom asked as she put the little slip of paper in the card we had gotten for Davey’s mother. “Yes.” I assured her. “Aren’t you meddling?” Dad asked as we pulled back onto the road. The airport looked odd without the corporate jet hangars, I noticed with a small corner of my brain. “How does this affect the timeline and your plans?” “It helps Davey, that’s what’s important.” I said firmly. “It keeps things on track with my plans.” “But, how do you know his mother will make the right choices?” Mom asked. “That’s where you come in.” I said firmly. “She needs friends, Mom. You and her got along real well in the last timeline. There’s no reason you shouldn’t get along in this one. You worked for her for a long while there.” “I did?” Mom asked with a frown. “Yes, and you both made a lot of money.” I said with a slight smile. “Mom, she’s been a pastor’s wife since she was out of high school. Along the way she’s held a lot of other jobs, but she was always the wife of a preacher. That made her isolated in a way, from other women her age. I remember Davey talking about how happy he was to see her with so many friends her own age in the last timeline. In a way, that kind of describes his parents. Both of them lived lives that were filled with other people, but they were isolated in one way or another for the most part, at least until the last timeline.” “For some reason that makes some sense.” Dad said with a shake of his head. “You both have friends that you do things with all the time.” I pointed out to them. “There are the Rushes, the Walkers, the Bettencourts, and a few others. All friends you’ve had for years and years.” “Speaking of them, what’s going on between Brandon, Trevor, and you?” Mom asked with a little frown as we entered Ceres proper. How many times had I driven this route with Davey in the last time as we visited his mother’s parents, and his father’s mother? The two sets of family literally lived ‘right around the corner’ from each other. Most people would consider it a blessing to have grandparents so close to each other, but I knew from a lifetime of experience that it was both a blessing and a curse. Then again, we’d followed a similar example buying both our Washington and our Modesto homes so close to his and my parents’ homes. My how the boys had loved that, trudging from house to house to get Christmas presents and candy from their different sets of grandparents. It was amazing how spoiled they had been, and yet turned out to be such fine young men. “Brian?” Mom’s voice was concerned as she looked at me in the back seat of the car. “Are you okay? You look like you’re about to cry.” “I was just remembering something about… about the boys.” I murmured softly and she frowned softly, but there was sympathy in her eyes. “How do you deal with that?” She asked me. “I would die if I lost you because I…” “I didn’t lose them.” I said vehemently. “They might be born again in this timeline, but they at least lived long, full lives in the last one.” “But it still hurts.” Mom stated and I nodded. “About Trevor and Brandon.” I said, picking up her question. “They’re just being… teenagers. Don’t worry, it’ll take a little time, but we’ll be back to being friends the way we’ve always been.” “That’s good to hear.” Dad said firmly as we pulled onto Myrtlewood and approached Pete and Monta’s house. Monta answered the door, and we were welcomed inside. Shantill was there, with her infant daughter, as were Davey’s mother, his sister, and one of Jenny’s friends. The house was crowded with all these people, and I couldn’t blame Sandy for wanting to move out. “My, you’re as big as Davey.” Monta said with a bright smile as she tried to push some Kool-Aid into my hand. I took it with a smile. “Thank you, ma’am.” I said with a smile. “Where is he?” “Oh, he got called for a job interview!” Monta said with a smile. “He did?” My voice almost cracked at that, and I noticed how Dad’s face flickered into a frown. Unfortunately, so did Davey’s mom and she frowned as well. There was no doubt in my mind they were frowning for different reasons though. “Yes he did!” Monta said, totally oblivious to the undercurrents in the kitchen and dining room area of her home. Pete was standing in the doorway that separated the area from the living room, and he was frowning as well. “Monta talked to her old shift supervisor at the cannery.” Pete grumbled with an intense look at dad. “She thinks he can get an evening and weekend shift there.” “They pay good, and he can work more during the summer.” Davey’s mother said with a defensive tone. “That was very nice of you to get him an interview.” Dad said to Monta who practically beamed. “Well, he’s a good boy.” She said. “He’s always doing his best for his mother and sister.” “It smells so good in here.” Mom said to change the subject, and Monta went on to tell Mom what she was cooking. “Davey will like going to Ceres next year.” Jenny said as I moved into the family room. It had once been the garage, but Pete had converted it into a huge family room years ago. I noticed Davey’s bed off in the corner and tried not to frown at the idea of him having to sleep down there. “Really?” I said, not quite sure what to make of her tone. This young teenager was nothing like the Jenny Jones I had known in the last timeline. She was an odd mix of adult and childish behaviors. One moment she would be more mature than her age, and then the next a spoiled brat. The Jenny I had known had always been supremely confident, gregarious, and an overall joy to be around. This Jenny would be similar, and then go into a pout, or a fit of rage that I wasn’t sure how to deal with. Tonight she seemed, edgy, almost jealous in a way. “Yeah, so you probably won’t be seeing as much of him.” She said. “That won’t change us being friends.” I said calmly. She frowned and walked away, taking her friend Stacey with her. That was a bit of a relief because Stacey was giving me an all too familiar look through her eyelashes. “Do you know my brother, Christopher?” Shantill asked me as she came into the family room, having left her daughter in Pete’s arms. “He went to Downey didn’t he?” I asked and she smiled with a look very similar to the one Stacey had been giving me. Since I remembered having to dodge roving hands from another Shantill, I made sure to leave as much distance as possible. Luckily, I was saved by Mom calling me to help set the table for Monta. Dinner was nice, even with the undercurrents running through the room. For some reason, it seemed Jenny was jealous of me for the amount of time Davey spent at our house. Stacey and Shantill took turns trying to pass me more food while giving each other murderous looks, and Davey’s mother kept giving my mother and father defensive looks as if she was worried about them looking down on her. “I’m home.” Davey’s voice called out when dinner was almost over, and there was a flurry of activity as Monta got up and set an extra place at the table for him, putting him next to me. “Well, what did he say?” His mother asked after he’d gotten settled. “I’ve got a job starting in two weeks, if school will approve the work permit.” Davey said with a shrug. Monta cheered, as did Jenny and his mother. “Congratulations, Davey.” Dad said after his immediate family had gotten done doing the same thing. “Thanks, Mr. B.” Davey said with a slight smile. “Why does the school have to approve you working there?” His sister asked after a few minutes. “It’s all the heavy machinery.” Davey said with a shrug. “Normally you can’t work there until you’re eighteen, but, well, because of Nanny having worked there, they’ll risk hiring me. I’ll talk the school counselor into it, don’t worry. They pay almost eight dollars an hour! That’s over twice minimum wage. I can get about four hours a night during the week, and then a full day on Saturday and Sunday.” “You’ll have a couple days off a week, won’t you?” Mom asked with a frown. “Um, well, I’ll need all the hours I can get.” Davey said. “I’m sure I’ll get a day or two off every couple of weeks.” “Yes, well, don’t wear yourself out.” Pete said, making a point to draw attention to his left hand. It was missing the two middle fingers. He’d lost them in an accident at a job site when he’d made a stupid mistake because he was working too long and had gotten too tired. “That heavy machinery will suck in a hand, or your arm and chop it right off without a second thought.” “I know, Papa.” Davey said in a long drawl, but there was a look in the back of his eyes that said Pete’s warning had reminded him that bad things could happen. When everyone had finished dinner, we moved into the family room. Monta served coffee for herself, Pete, and Dad. Mom and Davey’s mom were drinking hot tea while Davey and I were having water. Jenny had gone to her friend’s house, and Shantill was on the phone with one of her male friends. The conversation had started casually, with Sandy talking about the house in Ceres that they had applied for earlier that day. “Oh my, it’s time for the drawing!” Monta exclaimed when she noticed the time. She got up and went over to the big screen television, turning it on and changing the channel. “I swear you waste more money on that than I care to imagine!” Pete grumbled before turning to my father. “Both her and Sandy like to play that Lotto junk!” “That reminds me!” Mom said with a slight smile as she dug into her purse. She took out the card we’d signed earlier and that she’d sealed in the car. “Sandy, we are so glad you’re feeling better. We got you this card.” “Thank you, Brenda.” Sandy said with a smile as she opened the envelop just as the lottery drawing came on television. She opened the card as the third ball popped up and the number was called. A slip of paper fell out of the opened card and she bent to pick it up. “A lottery ticket!” “Yes, Davey mentioned how you like to play.” Mom said with a disingenuous smile while Davey gave me a suddenly suspicious look while the fourth ball popped up with its number. “Would you look at that, it’s got all four numbers!” Sandy exclaimed, suddenly on the edge of her seat and looking between the ticket and the television with excitement. “I’ve got none!” Monta called out as she came flying out of her Lazyboy chair to look over Sandy’s shoulder at the lottery ticket. When the fifth number appeared, she started jumping up and down. “That’s five!” “Oh my.” Sandy Jones said softly as the final number appeared on the screen, just as I remembered from another timeline. Sandy and my mother had both bought tickets to that drawing, and I’d joined that timeline’s Davey in teasing them after they’d lost. This time though, Sandy Jones had just won nine million dollars, and was screaming her head off while her son gave me a look filled with suspicion. Chapter 14 “Why’d you do it?” Davey asked me yet again as we stood looking out the window of his bedroom. Below us, his sister and her two friends were hanging over the railing of the back porch, looking at the river churning in the small canyon below. The room was empty, because we were officially just ‘looking’ at the place while his mother contemplated buying the house with her new wealth. “Davey…” I started to say but he shook his head and looked at me with sad eyes. He’d barely spoken to me for the last three weeks, and part of me couldn’t blame him too much for that. “No, Brian.” He said softly. “You didn’t even ask me what I thought. You just did it. What about those people that won the lottery the week after? We took money from them. They were supposed to win all of what Mom got.” “They still won three million.” I said with a sigh. “That’s still a lot of damn money.” “But it’s wrong that you took it away from them and gave it to my mom.” Davey said again, repeating the same thing he’d said last time. “Things would have worked out, you know. I had that job at the cannery and now Mom won’t even let me think about working. She wants me to study and do sports and all that stuff. That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” I answered honestly and he frowned, not expecting me to be so blunt. “That is exactly what I wanted, Davey Jones. I wanted you to be able to concentrate on school, on learning the things to get into a good school where you’ll study the things you need – that we need for the future.” “You did it so I could follow the damn path you’ve laid out for me in your head.” Davey snarled with a look of anger. “I thought you wanted to help me, to help make things better in this world.” I said softly and he frowned. “I do, but I don’t want to cheat in order to do it.” He said in a much softer tone. “Davey, I learned a lot of things in my last life.” I said gently, catching his blue eyes in mine and holding them. It struck me again how his eyes were blue, like mine, but a different shade, and they practically glittered with his emotions at this age in a way that they almost never did in the last timeline. There was still true innocence there, innocence long since gone by the time I’d ever met him. “One of the things I’ve learned is that sometimes you have to take what you need, even if it causes some harm to others. In this case, yes, what I did took money from people who would have gotten more otherwise. Still, they won, and they won a decent amount. Maybe they won’t be able to waste as much of it as they did in the last timeline, but they still got a lot of money. What your family got from it is going to be used to do a lot more than they ever would have done. With it, we’re going to change the world, make it a better place.” “But how does that justify it?” Davey asked. “How can we say we’re good people if we stole that money?” “Davey, I remember the numbers for four lottery drawings in my life.” I said after taking a deep breath. It was time for him to hear this part of my plan. “In five more years, there’s going to be a drawing worth over twenty times what your mother won. We’re going to win that one too.” “Why?” He asked with narrowed eyes and suspicion in his tone. “Because the world doesn’t run on good intentions.” I said with a hint of bitterness in my voice as I looked out the window again. It was strange, I’d had nothing to do with picking this house, but like in the last timeline, Pete had picked it out for Sandy, and she had fallen in love with it at first sight. I was certain she’d buy it, and it was in the Downey district. Even Jenny wasn’t complaining about having to leave Ceres, although she was talking about getting a transfer to let her stay in Ceres High, which was almost certain. She’d have a license soon, and her mother now had plenty of money to get her a car of her own. “What do you mean?” Davey asked me and I sighed. “In the last timeline, your father ran for President, twice, and he won both times.” I said softly and he made a snort. “Yeah, you told me about that.” He said with a hint of scorn. “It won’t happen this time, though. No one is going to vote for a convicted child molester.” “No, you’re right, it won’t happen, but that’s not my point.” I said patiently. “How much do you think he spent on those two campaigns?” “A lot.” Davey said quietly. “Millions of dollars, probably.” “The two campaigns totaled over five hundred million dollars.” I told him and looked back to see his eyes widening and he made a slight coughing noise. “Yeah, your father had to raise half a billion dollars to get, and keep the Presidency. All of his campaigns in total probably came to nearly a billion dollars. Think about that Davey. In the decades after his Presidency, he was widely acknowledged as one of the best presidents in our country’s history. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, not once, not twice, but four times. His acts as President, and later, changed the course of history for this country, and our world. I remember our grandchildren coming home from school, laughing and reading the entry on him from their history books.” “That’s still hard to believe.” Davey said with a whisper and wet eyes. “I can’t believe my father would be so… good.” “But he didn’t become President because he was a good man.” I pushed on. “Sure, that’s part of what got him in office, and made him the great President he was, but this world is as full of good men like your father as it is full of bad, stupid men. Without having the ability to raise that billion dollars for his campaigns, your father might have never been more than a preacher, or a truck driver. In order to change the world, he had to have money to do it. Think about it though, because he took a billion dollars people gave to him, and because of his policies, billions of people lived better lives, and many made more money than they would have otherwise. That billion spent on him yielded results that can never be measured.” “Does it matter?” Davey asked bitterly. “That’s all gone now, destroyed by your time traveling.” “Yes, it does matter.” I said with a sigh. “You may not remember them, no one may remember all those people, but it doesn’t change the fact that they existed or that they had better lives.” “What you’re saying is that it takes money to make things change, to make the world a better place like you want to do, and we have to have that money.” Davey summarized and I smiled while nodding my agreement. “Nine million paid out over twenty years won’t do all that much.” Davey said softly. “No, but a couple hundred million, well around a hundred million after taxes and all that will be enough seed money to make a start.” I said and he nodded. “There are other things, like certain timely investments, that will take that money and turn it into something close to what your father raised for his campaigns.” “So in order to do the good you want to do, we have to take money from others.” Davey said succinctly. “What do most people do when they win the lottery?” “Pay off their bills, quit their jobs, and spend it on themselves or their family, maybe some family friends.” I said with a shrug. “We’re going to do more than that though. You and I, if you want, we will change this world like your father did, although I hope to make it last longer than he did.” “How did he fail to do that?” Davey asked and I smiled. “Cult of personality.” I answered and he frowned. “Huh?” He stated. “It’s something I first learned in college.” I said with a shrug. “Okay, maybe I heard Davey and his father talking about it in high school, but they were discussing Ronald Reagan. But, when I learned it in college was when Davey and I first really started discussing it in the context of our national political history.” “So you’re saying I need to go to school to learn about this?” Davey asked with a slight chuckle. “Yes.” I answered him honestly and he nodded. “I still don’t like it.” He sighed. “You don’t have to like it.” I said with a shrug. “Most of the time I don’t like it either, taking money from people like this, but it is necessary.” “How did you get so… jaded?” Davey asked and I had to laugh. “I’m not jaded compared to some people.” I shrugged and he gave me that look that I now knew to mean he was thinking about time travel. “How did I get so jaded?” He asked softly. “You already know the answer to that.” I replied and he stared at me for a long moment before nodding slowly. “Oh, good, you’re both up here.” Sandy Jones said from the doorway to Davey’s room. My mother was right behind her, and both of them were smiling. “What do you think, Davey? Is this place good enough?” “I love it Mom.” Davey said with a gentle smile. “It’s like we were meant to live here.” That bastard! He said that on purpose, since I’d already told him the history of the house in the last timeline. It was all I could do to not burst out in laughter. “What do you think Brian?” She asked and I had to take a deep breath before answering. “I like it a lot.” I answered her. “Good, then I’ll let Dad haggle with the realtor and get the price down a bit.” She said before turning and walking away with a determined stride. “She’s happy.” Davey smiled softly. “No matter what else, this is making her happy, and your mother… why did they turn down half the money?” “We don’t need millions of dollars.” I said with a shrug. “Besides, our moms are talking about going into business together and your mom is providing most of the start-up funds for that.” “True.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “If I didn’t believe you already, I’d believe you came from the future now. Wait, I just thought of something. You said the timeline was already changing. Aren’t you worried the cumulative effects of the changes you’re making will change the lottery numbers of that big jackpot you want to win?” “Nope.” I answered confidently. “Why not?” He asked. “I don’t understand the physics myself, and I know you’re not much on the mathematics.” I semi-answered and he frowned, but didn’t protest. It was true, even after a hundred years of life, Davey was mediocre at best with math. “What it comes down to is that changes can effect the world in a lot of ways, but certain events are largely unchanged unless there’s something really massive that happens. Random events, like the random drawing of the lottery numbers stays random. If you want to change them, your best bet would be to change things so the lottery is outlawed and the drawing never held, for example.” “Or start World War Three and get everything nuked.” Davey said with a slow nod of his head and I nodded my agreement. “Yep, like that.” I agreed. “In some weird way it makes sense.” Davey said with a smile. “So, did I hear right, that the last game of the baseball season is this weekend?” “Yeah.” I answered the question easily. He often did that, totally change tracks when he felt a particular topic had been fully discussed. “I think I’ll go.” Davey said and I laughed.",

I was surprised though when he got a pensive look on his face. “Brian, can I ask you something?” “Sure.” I said casually, but there was a sudden tightening in my gut. That look on his face meant he was thinking of something unpleasant. “You’re from a future, but you say the future isn’t set in stone.” Davey said slowly as though he was thinking aloud more than anything. “Some things will be the same, but other things will be different, right? That’s how… that is how you can plan to make some changes, to make the world a better place.” “That’s right.” I said softly. “But you can’t guarantee it will work.” Davey continued his thought process aloud. “You mentioned how one of the other timelines the other me created, it ended in nuclear war, which was when they created the timeline you came from.” “You got it correct.” I confirmed for him. “The same thing could happen here, if we’re not careful, although it’s pretty late in the timeline for something like that. It was other time travelers that really precipitated that war, and their attempt to control the secrets of time travel. That secret’s dead now. I don’t know nearly enough to make another machine. In a couple of years, the Soviet Union will cease to exist, and while there’s still threats of a city being blown up, or minor stuff like that, it’ll be decades before China gets close enough to having the technology to instigate a war that could threaten the entire planet.” “Yeah, but doesn’t that mean that you can’t absolutely predict certain things?” Davey asked slowly. “You can’t tell me my mom will live to be an old woman, or that my sister won’t die in a car accident, or even that you or I won’t die in an accident.” “Life would be kind of boring if we knew everything that was going to happen, wouldn’t it?” I asked him and he chuckled softly. “Uh huh, but really, Brian, what makes us any better suited to changing the world?” Davey asked me in a quiet voice. “Anything can happen, right? How do we know we’ll be happy, and that we’ll do what we set out to do?” “Right now the Governor of Arkansas is biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to go after his lifelong dream of becoming President.” I said in a firm, but quiet voice. “He’s going to win in 1992, ending twelve years of Republican rule from the White House. There’s many things he will want to do in office and while he’s President, this country – and the world will change from the Cold War era into a new era. He’ll succeed at a lot of things while in office, and fail at others, but in the end his most memorable feat in office will be that he was impeached because he lied about getting a blow job from an intern.” “You’re kidding!” Davey’s voice cracked and his eyes were wide. “Nope.” I said smugly. “Well, that’s what he’ll be remembered for if he doesn’t get some good advice and follow it while he’s President. Still, the guy’s been dreaming since he met John F. Kennedy that he would one day be President, and he’ll succeed, but he’ll be remembered for being impeached over a lie, more than anything else.” “What does that have to do with…” Davey’s voice drifted off while I smiled. “It means I don’t know if we’ll succeed, but I know we should try, and I know that we should be careful not to get tripped up by stupid things along the way.” I answered. “I also believe that if Bill Clinton didn’t run in 1992, we might have been worse off than we were with him in office. The bottom line is that we have to try, and no, we’re not guaranteed to win, but if we don’t try, there will be no chance that things are better. I can’t promise you anything, except that I’ll always love you, and I’ll always be there for you.” “Unless you die in a car accident.” Davey pointed out and I had to nod. “Well, I’ll just have to make sure that if you are in an accident, I’m there with you so I won’t have to see what happens without you around.” “I…” I lost my voice at that and he smiled before stepping closer to me and kissing me on the lips. “We better go see what Mom’s up to.” He said with an impish grin before walking out. I followed him, thoroughly confused about the whole point of all this talking, but decided to just stop worrying and see what was in store for me. “This will make a great office for the both of us.” Davey’s mother was saying to my mother as we found them standing in front of the room that I had always thought of as President Jones’s private office. For some reason her words sent a pang of regret through me. I still had not met the man in this timeline, and part of me didn’t want to meet him. “If you think so, Sandy.” Mom answered with a grin. “This house is wonderful, and it is so close to ours.” “Good, then it’ll be easy for us to get together here.” Mom said as Pete came around the corner with the realtor trailing behind him. “You sure you want this place?” Pete asked Sandy who nodded. I knew it was an act on Pete’s part as he sighed before turning to the realtor. “If she’s so set on the place, I guess we’ll take it, but we’re not paying a dime over four-twenty.” “I’ll have to talk to the seller, but I think he’ll agree.” The realtor said with a slightly oily smile. That was a good thirty thousand less than the asking price, so Pete must have done some good bargaining, but it looked like the deal was made. “We’d better get heading back.” Pete said. “Mom should be home with the baby by now.” “Let’s go.” Sandy said before calling out for her daughter. Sandy and Mom took Sandy’s RX-7, while I got to drive Davey and the girls back and Pete took his own van back to Ceres. “Can we stop at Foster’s Freeze on the way?” Jenny asked petulantly as we neared Ceres. Her and her friends had done nothing but chatter away the entire time, while Davey and I had pretty much remained silent. “Sure.” I said with a sigh. She was always wanting something extra, no matter what we did, and as I expected, it was Davey who paid for the slushies at the Foster’s Freeze. We got back to Pete and Monta’s house just in time to see a strange man get out of his car, wearing a suit, and walk up to Sandy, who was standing in the driveway talking to Pete and my mother. “Who’s that?” Jenny asked as I parked and we got out of the car just in time to hear Sandy start shouting at the man, who walked away quickly, holding a clipboard and shaking his head. Davey rushed forward to his mother’s side. “What’s wrong?” He asked her. “Your good-for-nothing father!” Pete snapped while Sandy held out a packet of papers to Davey. “The bastard is suing me!” Sandy snarled angrily. “What?” Jenny half-screeched. “Why?” Davey asked as he took the papers and started riffling through them. I looked over his shoulder and read that Sandy was being sued by her estranged husband for half of the lottery money. “Just because I haven’t gotten around to divorcing him yet he’s saying he deserves half of my money!” Sandy half-yelled, but she was near hysterical as my mother put a comforting arm around her. She turned and started crying into Mom’s shoulder. “He can’t do this.” Davey snarled angrily as he shoved the papers at his grandfather who was giving him a stern gaze. “Davey, don’t do…” Pete started to say, but Davey wasn’t listening. Instead, Davey was storming away, half-running down the street. With a glance at Mom I started after him. “Davey…” I called out when I got close to him, halfway to his other grandmother’s house. She lived right around the corner, and it was a very short distance. “Don’t try to stop me.” Davey fumed without slowing down as I pulled abreast of him. “I’m not going to do that.” I said firmly. “Still, let’s walk, okay?” “Why?” He asked. “So you have a few extra minutes to think about what you’re going to say instead of just spouting off at him.” I answered. He stopped suddenly and gave me a long look. “You’re not going to try to stop me?” He asked. “No.” I answered simply. “I’ve got your back. This is wrong of him to try to do this.” “Oh.” Davey said softly and then cocked his head as he looked at me. “What do you think I should say?” “I don’t know.” I shrugged. “The man I knew would never do something like this, so you know him better than me. Plus, I always like to think things through before I do something. You’re the one who things on his feet really well, as long as you take a few minutes to run things through your head first. Me, I’d take a day or two to get something half as decent as what you can put together in a few minutes.” “Okay.” Davey said with a curt nod of his head. “He’s doing this because… well because money has always been tight for grandma. He’s living there with her, Aunt Bev, Ron, and Bryan, and he’s having to work at McDonald’s, which I know he hates. He thinks it’s beneath him. Mom’s got this huge pile of money, and if she shared it with him, he’d not have to do that.” “Do you think he’s even talked to her?” I asked Davey and he nodded. “She told him no way in hell was he touching any of her money.” Davey answered. “What can you do?” I asked him and he took a deep breath. “He loves me.” Davey said softly. “Dad hates the fact that we don’t get along like we used to, and that I hardly ever go visit him.” “That’s not your fault.” I affirmed and he shook his head. “That still doesn’t change the fact that he misses that.” Davey said. “Okay, I think I know what I’m going to say.” “Good.” I said as he started walking, but he stopped again and turned to look at me with a little smile on his face. “Thanks.” He said quietly. “You’re welcome.” I replied with a return smile. “It’s… I know we don’t talk about… about being in a relationship a lot, mostly because it makes you uncomfortable, but this is what I want. I want us to be able to depend on each other for advice, and to help each other out.” “I… I think I could get use to this.” Davey said with a husky voice and he squeezed my arm once before turning to walk towards his grandmother’s. “You coming?” “I’m right behind you.” I said affectionately and he chuckled. Soon enough we were walking up the driveway to his grandmother’s. Her old white and brown Chrysler was parked on the right of the driveway, while an ugly brown van was parked on the left and a boat was in the grassy area next to the left side of the driveway. The little red 1979 Toyota pickup that Davey’s father had bought years ago from Pete was parked on the side of the road in front of the house. It seemed everyone was home. “Davey!” Davey’s paternal grandmother nearly shouted when she answered his knock on the door. “What a surprise! Oh look at you!” “Hi Grandma.” Davey said as the woman pulled him into a tight hug. She was shorter than him, and looked a lot younger than the last time I’d seen her in 2007. “Is Dad home?” “DAVID!” She shouted before releasing Davey. “Oh Davey! We haven’t seen you in weeks! What have you been up to? Who is this?” “Grandma, this is my friend Brian.” Davey said politely. “Brian, this is my grandma.” “It’s nice to meet a friend of Davey’s.” She said excitedly to me. “You boys come on inside and let me fix you something to eat!” “I’m just here to talk to my father.” Davey said firmly, letting his anger show a bit and she frowned immediately. “It’s about your mother, isn’t it?” She said sourly. “She got her papers today. Well, if that’s what it takes to bring you over here, I say your father should sue her every damn day! I swear, that woman! First she ruins our family, airing our dirty laundry for everyone to see and then she goes and wins the lottery and refuses to share the money like a good wife should! If I had that bitch in front of me right now I’d…” “Stop it.” Davey growled and she frowned at him. “Well, if that’s the way you’re going to talk to me, your grandmother, I don’t want you coming inside this house!” She snarled and stepped back as the sound of footsteps could be heard coming down the hallway. Davey’s father appeared behind her, his hair still wet from the shower he must have been taking when we showed up. “Davey!” He said with excitement and a broad grin while I took in the differences between this man and the one I remembered from another time. This David Jones Sr. was overweight, and had a bushy mustache that he’d never worn in the time I’d known him in that other timeline. “I need to talk to you.” Davey said firmly, ignoring his grandmother’s noises of distaste and staring at his father. His entire body was tense. “Who is this?” His father asked, nodding in my direction. “This is my best friend, Brian.” Davey answered. “Can we talk out here?” “Uh, sure.” His father said as Davey and I took a few steps back and down so we were off of the front porch. As he stepped outside he turned to his mother. “I’ll be just a few minutes, mother.” “You put him in his place, David!” She snarled before slamming the door behind him. He shook his head and turned to look at Davey. “I take it your mother was served?” He asked and Davey nodded. “You want to talk about this in front of him?” “He and his parents bought Mom the winning lottery ticket as a gift.” Davey said through gritted teeth as he stared his father down. “His family let us use their apartment in the city when Mom was going through her surgery. I’ve stayed at his place for the last few months, and his mother his going into business with Mom. As far as I’m concerned he’s a part of my family.” “I see.” David Jones Sr. said as he gave me an appraising look. “I appreciate everything your family has done for my son and my wife.” “She’s only your wife because she hasn’t gotten the nerve up yet to actually file for divorce.” Davey snarled. “Maybe now you’ve finally pushed her far enough she’ll file the damn paperwork.” “Watch your language young man!” Davey’s father snapped at him. “You’re still my son!” “You may have sired me, but you’ve long since given up any right to be a part of my family.” Davey shot back angrily. “Only because your mother refused to…” David Jones started to say, but Davey cut him off. “She refused to forget what you did to Jenny, how you did what no father should ever to do to his daughter, and she refuses to live a lie just so you can save face.” Davey shot back. “We were married before God, and you can’t just turn your back on that when things don’t go right.” His father retorted. “This is a little beyond ‘irreconcilable differences.” Davey snorted. “You don’t deserve her.” “How dare you say that?” Davey’s father nearly shouted as his face turned purple. “I don’t know how you think you can talk to an adult, much less your father that way but I won’t stand for it!” “I can talk to you this way because you’ve long since lost any right to deal with me as a parent to his child.” Davey’s voice dropped an octave and his hands balled up into a fist. “When you touched my sister the way you did, you gave up any and all rights to deal with me as a parent. The most you can ever hope for is that one day I’ll be ready to forgive you and we might develop a relationship as adults. When you did what you did to Jenny, you did more than just molest her. You destroyed our family. You forced Mom to make decisions no wife or mother should ever have to make, and you forced me to assume the responsibilities of an adult. Or have you forgotten that it has been me, not you, whose been paying the bills for Jenny’s psychotherapist?” “I haven’t… you can’t blame me that no one will hire me after it was in all the papers…” His father said weakly. “Now you try to take what Mom has luckily been given thanks to Brian and his parents?” Davey continued in that low, vicious tone. “Is that how you plan to prove to me that you’re worthy of being a part of my life?” “What?” David Jones Sr. asked with real confusion in his eyes. “You do want to earn my approval, my respect, and maybe have some reconciliation with me and Jenny, don’t you?” Davey asked calmly. “Of course I do…” His father replied, but stopped as Davey stared at him silently. “Is this the best way to do it?” Davey asked him and the older man stared at his son for a long time. “When did you get so wise?” David Jones asked his son. “I did listen, you know.” His son stated in a voice that was void of the anger that had been there earlier. It was still quiet, but there was a softness to it that had not been evident until now. The older man’s head jerked up a bit and he gave his son a quizzical look. “When you were preaching. I listened. When I was younger, I remember you preaching about Jesus and how he acted when the Roman soldiers came to arrest him. Remember in Waterford when Sampson was beating me up? I could have fought back anytime, I could have pummeled him, but I didn’t because I remembered you teaching how violence was not the answer according to Jesus.” “You did fight him eventually, and you won.” David Sr. said with a slight smile while I stared in surprise at Davey. I’d never heard this story before. “You and he were the best of friends for a long time, until we moved back to Modesto.” “Yes, but I didn’t fight him until he hit April.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. “He’s in Modesto now.” David Sr. said calmly. “I saw him the other day. His parents moved to Modesto last year.” “Oh.” Davey said softly before shaking his head. “My point, Dad, is that I did listen to your sermons. There was a lot of good in them, and I’m a better person for having listened to them. When… when we came back and I was old enough to work, I got a job so we could afford Jenny’s sessions. No, don’t look like that. This is not an attack on you for not being able to pay for it. I do understand why you couldn’t, but because of what I learned from your sermons I didn’t hesitate to do the right thing when it was needed.” “I… I can’t say how proud of you I am for that.” His father said in a quiet tone and Davey cocked his head to the side while looking at his father. “Then why don’t you practice what you use to preach?” He asked his father and the older man flinched before frowning. “I… I… you don’t understand.” David Sr. replied softly. “Your grandmother’s had to take a second mortgage out on the house because of the legal bills, and Bev’s medical bills. Your Aunt was in the hospital for a few weeks there, you know.” “No, I didn’t, and I should have.” Davey said softly. “She’d like to see you.” David Sr. said softly. “Maybe I will, before I leave.” Davey said quietly. “Still, does any of that justify you doing this to Mom?” “I… no, it doesn’t.” David Sr. said softly. “It’s just… you know how your grandmother can be.” “Yes, but that doesn’t justify you giving in to her.” Davey said firmly. “I have to live here, damn it!” His father snapped and Davey did look sympathetic for a moment. “I’d be ready to kill her if I had to live here for more than a few months.” Davey snorted and his father chuckled softly. “Look, Dad, I didn’t know about the mortgage and all that. Maybe I can talk Mom into helping with that. She loves Bev still, you know.” “I know.” Dad sighed. “Sometimes I feel guilty because the two of them have been friends since high school and now Sandy can’t even talk to her on the phone.” “Dad, you don’t deserve half the money, but Mom won’t ignore a real need over here like this.” Davey said in a quiet but firm voice. “Let me talk to her, give me some time.” “Okay, son.” David Sr. said with a sigh. “Your grandmother might kill me, but I’ll drop the suit.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Now, why don’t you come and say hello to your aunt?” His father asked. “Brian, you’re going to love my Aunt Bev.” Davey said with a bright smile as he turned to me. “Just be careful or she’ll run you over with her wheelchair.” “Okay.” I said with a smile of my own while my feet winced in remembered pain. Okay, maybe these feet didn’t remember the pain of her wheelchair running over them, but I did have those memories, and the woman could be quite vicious when she wanted to make a point. Chapter 15 It was amazing what a simple apology could do. Some people have made a science of apologizing, both now and in the future. Certainly for anyone in the public spotlight knowing how to give the correct apology at the correct time was an important thing to know. Sometimes a bouquet of flowers with a simple note saying “I’m Sorry” would heal over a spat between lovers. It could be a box of chocolates, or a special trip including a favorite activity of the person being apologized to would work. Other times, giving a good apology required a complicated series of events, or endless repetition. There were people who didn’t want to hear a simple “I’m Sorry.” They want to hear you explain why you’re sorry, and what you did wrong first, and then the words. Still others wouldn’t listen to any apology at all, but rather required a long series of actions before they would accept the apology. David Jones Sr. had a lot to apologize for in this timeline, and he had a lot of people to whom he needed to apologize. Each of them required a different style of approach, a different form of apology, and none of them were inclined to forgive him anytime soon. The little stunt with the aborted attempt to get some of Sandy’s lottery money had only made the hurdles higher, and I was both surprised and pleased when he started making overtures right away. The next Saturday after Davey confronted him, he walked over to Pete and Monta’s house. Dad and I had been invited by Pete to join him and Davey on a fishing trip. It had been a good trip, and we’d come back in the late afternoon with the legal limit of fish. Davey’s father showed up just as we finished unloading the van, and Pete tensed up, as did Davey, but it was Davey who went to confront his father while Pete watched warily. “What do you want?” Davey asked sternly. “I… I would like to speak to your mother.” David Sr. said in a cautious voice. “Why?” Davey’s voice dripped with suspicion. “These are the official papers dropping the lawsuit.” His father answered while holding up a sheaf of papers in his hands. “I’ve also got papers filed for starting the divorce proceedings, if she wants. This way she doesn’t have to pay for anything.” “Okay.” Davey said with a hint of anger in his voice and he turned back to look at his grandfather who stared at the two of them for a long moment before nodding. “I’ll go get her.” Pete said gruffly and walked into the house. Sandy came out a few minutes later with an apprehensive look on her face. “Pete says you have something for me, Dave.” She said frostily and her husband handed over one set of papers. “Here’s the papers dropping the suit.” He said to her. “It was wrong of me to file them. I have no right to any of that, and I’m sorry.” “You’re damn right you have no right.” Sandy snarled, but she also relaxed a bit as she took the papers. “What made you do it?” “My mother.” He said with a heavy sigh and she actually laughed briefly before shaking her head. “That doesn’t make me any less responsible. I’m the one who did it, even if she was pushing me. It’s my responsibility.” “It’s about damn time you took responsibility for your mistakes.” Pete grumbled from where he stood behind Sandy. David Jones Sr. just nodded, agreeing with Pete and forcing a look of surprise to the older man’s face. “I… I also have papers here to start the proceedings for a divorce.” David Sr. said and Sandy gasped slightly. “You want a divorce?” She said in a voice that sounded horrified. “No, I don’t, but you might.” He said softly. “I’ve made so many mistakes, done so many things wrong I can’t blame you if you want one, but I know that before you couldn’t afford one. You can now, but I am the one who’s brought us to this point in our relationship, I’m the one who destroyed our family, and I’m the one who should take this step, or at least offer it to you if it is what you want. You’ve done nothing wrong. In fact, you’ve been doing things right, the way I should have. You’ve put the needs of the kids first, and put a stop to–to the things that I was doing that were wrong.” “I… put those away.” Sandy said to him with a weak voice. “I’m not saying I won’t want a divorce, but not right now. You’ve never… you’ve never accepted responsibility for what you did before. Your daughter needs to hear you say that.” “She will, whenever you and she are ready.” He replied in a voice that shook only a little bit. “Thank you, Dave.” She said in a quiet, but clear dismissal. “You deserve it, and more.” He said before turning to go. He took two steps before stopping and turning back. “Sandy, I almost forgot. Bev wanted me to say she misses you and Jenny. Would it be okay for her to come and visit?” “Anytime.” Sandy replied evenly and he nodded before resuming his course back to his mother’s house. When he was out of sight, Sandy turned and buried her head against Davey’s chest while she shook with her sobs. Dad touched my shoulder and nodded towards the house. I followed him and Pete inside while Davey comforted his mother. As spring turned into summer, that day marked a turning point for Davey and his family. It took another three weeks for them to move into the new house. During that time, Davey would stay with us during the week, and my room often reeked of the sex we would have in there at night, but on Friday night he’d go back to Pete and Monta’s house and not return until Sunday night. I found that I was okay with that, because it gave me time to rebuild my friendship with Brandon and Trevor, as well as to continue getting to know Todd better. The weekend where Sandy, Davey, and Jenny moved into their new home saw all of us showing up to help out with the move. Sandy had bought a bunch of new furniture for the house, and had spent the last few weeks totally revamping not only her wardrobe, but her childrens’ as well. Davey looked quite good in the matching outfits she bought for him, as did Jenny. To my surprise, David Sr. was also there, helping out with the move, as were Bev’s son Bryan and Bev herself – although she spent much of the time in her wheelchair directing everyone where to put things. When our Junior year of high school ended, Davey had a big party at his house with most of his friends, and several of mine. Sandy wasn’t there that weekend, and Davey shocked me when he told me that she was in San Francisco for the weekend with his father. I knew that they had started going to counseling with Jenny’s therapist as a family, but I hadn’t known things were going in the direction of his parents getting back together. I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but both Davey and his sister seemed to be happy with that development. In July, Davey got to spend two weeks with Brandon, Trevor, and me at a football camp in Minnesota. At first he was the worst player at the camp, but by the end of the two weeks, he had progressed so far that I was confident he’d make first string on the Varsity team at school. We made a good team on defense together, and while I knew he’d never been into baseball the way it was in the last timeline, I could see the abilities that had made him a good player shining through with some concentrated training and attention. It was a few days after we got back from football camp that things changed yet again. His mother had bought some excellent weight equipment and put it on their spacious back patio just like in the last timeline. Three days a week, I’d go over and we’d work out together. Most of the time, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd would meet up with us as well, and we’d go out for milkshakes or just hang out after the workout. That day, it was just the two of us until Todd opened the sliding glass door and walked out on the patio, followed by a familiar face. “Hey!” Davey called happily from where he stood spotting me on the bench press. While I put the bar back on its rest, he crossed over to meet Todd and hug him tightly. “We didn’t think you were coming!” “I had a guest come over.” Todd said and stood out of the way as I stood up and went to stand by them. “Davey, you might remember Sean from La Loma.” “Oh, yeah, hey Sean!” Davey said with a genuine smile as he held out his hand. Sean looked uncomfortable, but shook Davey’s hand. “I haven’t seen you since before we moved to Nevada. How ya doing?” “I’m okay.” Sean mumbled before looking at me with a look that wasn’t exactly pleasant. “Sean, do you know Brian?” Todd asked and Sean hung his head slightly. “Yeah.” He mumbled. “Hi Sean.” I said as cheerfully as I could. He looked so young. While he wasn’t as tall as I seemed to remember him being in the last timeline, he was still taller than he had been our freshman year. His face was paler though, far more freckled, and he had almost no muscle on him at all. In fact, he was as slender as a bean pole. “Hi.” Sean mumbled back. “I think I owe you an apology.” I said in as soft a voice as I could. Davey looked at me sharply while Todd nodded politely and Sean looked at me with bewilderment. “What do you mean?” Sean mumbled in confusion. “Back in Freshman year, you got stuffed in a trashcan at school.” I stated carefully, mostly because “I” had not been there, but the “me” of this timeline had been there. “I didn’t stop it from happening, and that was wrong. No one should be treated like that.” “Oh man, I’d forgotten about that.” Davey said sympathetically and he looked back at Sean. “Sean, I am so sorry I didn’t do anything to stop it either. Brian’s right, that was wrong of us.” “I deserved it.” Sean mumbled. “You don’t have to apologize to me.” “Bullshit.” Todd snorted. “No Sean, you’re wrong.” I said firmly. “No one deserves to be treated like that, and I hope that one day you might be able to forgive us for that. I just hope we can be friends from now on.” “You don’t want to be friends with me.” Sean mumbled and then he looked angrily at Todd. “You brought me here on purpose, didn’t you? You set me up.” “Hold on, Sean.” Davey said as the smaller guy started to walk away. Davey went up to him and put his hand on Sean’s shoulder. The guy flinched at that, but he stopped and turned around. “What?” Sean snapped angrily. “Why do you think you deserved what happened back then?” Davey asked him calmly and Sean’s shoulders slumped. “You’ll probably hear about it anyway.” Sean mumbled and then hung his head, probably trying to hide the tear that dripped down his cheek. “Dad already warned the pastor at the church and he told the youth pastor so by the time school starts everyone will know. I’m queer.” “So?” Davey asked in a voice that didn’t sound anything but confused. Sean had stiffened as he said the last part, and now he was staring at Davey in total confusion. “So, I’m a fag.” Sean snapped angrily. “I’m a fudgepacker. They’ve sent me to all sorts of quacks to make me straight but it doesn’t fucking work!” “Of course it doesn’t work.” Davey shrugged. “If you’re gay, you’re gay. Shame on those quacks taking your parents’ money for something they can’t change.” “Then again maybe his parents deserve to lose their money like that for trying to make him change.” I added and now Sean was staring at both of us with wide eyes while Todd practically split his face in two with his smile. “I… you… you’re all crazy!” Sean exclaimed. “I told you that you’d be better off back here in Modesto.” Todd said with an I-told-you-so expression on his face. “What are your friends going to say if they see you hanging around me?” Sean muttered. “You don’t even know me!” “We used to know you years ago, Sean.” I said in a gentle tone. “You were a good guy back then, and I’d be downright shocked if you weren’t still a good guy. If any of our friends have a problem with you, they have a problem with us and aren’t worth being our friends.” “Brian’s right.” Davey said firmly before looking back at me with a smile. “You think we’re done, Brian? I could use a milkshake. It’s getting hot. Then maybe we could come back and go for a swim.” “I don’t have any money for a milkshake.” Sean said. “It’s on me.” Davey said firmly. “I was your friend back in Freshman year and I totally dropped the ball on being a good friend back then. I’ve got a lot of making up to do for that.” “I don’t have a swimsuit.” Sean mumbled. “Then I’ll get you one on the way back.” I said firmly. “It’s the least I can do…” “You don’t have to do this.” Sean mumbled. “No, we don’t, but we want to do this.” I said firmly. He just shook his head, which Davey and I took as consent. When we got to the Snowy’s that made the best milkshakes in town, Sean had started to come out of his shell just a bit. I wasn’t surprised to see Brandon and Trevor there, and when they came over to join us, Sean started to go back into his shell a bit. Trevor didn’t remember him at all, but there was something in Brandon’s eyes that told me he remembered Sean. My two oldest friends joined us in heading back to Davey’s pool, even stopping at the sporting goods store to get Sean a set of swimming trunks. To my surprise, Brandon had whispered something to Trevor while we were walking into the store, and the two of them came up to Sean and apologized to him for the incident in Freshman year. Then they both pitched in for Sean’s swimsuit. “I can’t wear this!” Sean muttered as he looked at the dark green Speedo that Brandon was holding up for him. “Dude, it’d look good on you.” Brandon insisted and I caught the look in his eyes. So did Davey, who gave me a little smile while Sean continued to protest. “We all should get Speedos.” Todd suggested with a bright grin as he looked at Trevor. Oh yeah, I knew what the red head was thinking, wanting to see the school’s star quarterback in a Speedo. “Okay.” Davey said with a leer of his own. “No way.” Sean protested weakly, but his eyes almost bugged out as Davey held up a pair of white Speedos with red stripes on the hips. It was very difficult for me not to start drooling right then and there. Regular workouts had helped Davey shed those extra pounds and the thought of him in that was absolutely worthy of a bucket of drool. I was starting to laugh until Davey threw the white Speedos at me. “These are for you.” Davey said emphatically while pulling out another white Speedo, although this one had blue stripes. “These are for me.” “Cool.” I said while Brandon picked out a blue Speedo. We all paid for our Speedos, with Trevor having picked out a black pair and Todd a red pair that was going to clash madly with his hair. All of us pitched in for Sean’s over his continued protests. Then we set off for Davey’s house. “Let’s get changed!” Davey’s voice showed his excitement as we all rushed up to his room and started to change. Sean turned white and fled out of the room, down the hallway to the bathroom. “What’s his problem?” Brandon said in an offended tone. “He’s shy.” Todd said defensively with a warning look at Davey and me. “He’s not a jock like you guys.” “We’ll get him over that by the time summer’s out.” Brandon said confidently. When Sean reappeared with a towel wrapped around him, no one said anything. By the time we reached the pool, he was a lot calmer, and although he waited until he was next to the pool before taking off the towel and slipping into the water. At first he hung back while Davey and Brandon got into a splash war, but soon he was swimming around and playing like the rest of us. It was good to see that, as my conscience was screaming at me. Sean had been a good friend in the last timeline, and had sacrificed much over the years, as much as Davey had, if not more. He deserved to be happy now, even if he didn’t remember those times. Seeing the way Brandon reacted to him was another good thing as far as I was concerned. It was very obvious to me, and probably to Davey that Brandon was interested in Sean as more than a possible friend. Watching them dance around each other was going to be fun. The weeks that followed were as close to perfect as anything could be in life. Every day I was over at Davey’s house, and Sean was there almost constantly with Todd. Brandon was there quite a bit too, and while Trevor was still spending time with his newest girlfriend, he was there more days than not. Mom and Sandy were moving along with their Event Planning business as well. They had three clients already, and were deep in working with those people. Two of the clients were weddings, both referred by Sandy’s family members, and the third was actually a political fundraiser for a City Council candidate that my mother knew from one of the local charities she worked with. Sandy had even ‘hired’ Davey’s Aunt Bev to help with the planning and arrangements. The woman may have been confined to a wheelchair, but she was ecstatic with the work, and was over nearly every day, forcing her husband, or Davey’s father to get her ready and drive her to the house. On the phone she was a living terror to the different vendors they were using. Her quick wit, and ample vocabulary meant that anyone who didn’t perform up to her expectations got a tongue-lashing they would not soon forget. Whoever was over when she started in on someone over the phone would gather outside the office she used and listen. After she was done, she’d start in on us for giggling while she was on the phone. Like all good things, though, it eventually came to an end when Sean’s father paid a visit Davey’s mother while we were out on a day trip to Sonora. On the way back home, we’d dropped Sean off with Todd at Todd’s house, and Davey and I had gone back to his house. We’d planned on spending the night since Pete was coming by the next morning to take us fishing up in the mountains. “Davey, Brian, I need to talk to both of you now.” His mother said in a stern voice as we walked in the front door. It was obvious she was pissed about something, but we shrugged and put down the bags filled with the things we’d bought for our mothers, and Davey’s sister. She shut the door behind us as we entered the office that had been President Jones’s in another timeline. There were three desks in here, and while it was still wood-paneled, it had a much more feminine feel to it now. “What’s up, Mom?” Davey asked in a slightly nervous voice. Both Bev and my mother were in the room, and while they didn’t look happy, their looks were directed more at Sandy than at us, which made me even more confused as to what was wrong. “What do you know about that Sean boy?” She asked and everything suddenly made sense. It was with a sinking feeling in my stomach that I guessed what had happened. “We went to La Loma together, and Downey until we moved to Nevada.” Davey began after a quick look at me. “He’s a good guy.” “How do you know that?” His mother asked sharply. “Did he tell you why his family moved to Southern California? Did he tell you that he’s been seeing a therapist for years now?” “Mom, Jenny’s been seeing a therapist for years, and for that matter, we’ve been going with her!” Davey retorted hotly. “What does that have to do with Sean?” “We’ve been seeing a therapist to help your sister recover from what was done to her.” His mother shouted. “He’s seeing one because he’s the one who’s perverted! Has he tried to touch you?” “What do you mean ‘has he tried to touch me’?” Davey asked with a sharp edge to his voice and I almost winced. “We goof around all the time, but then again so does Brian and me.” “Don’t try to play coy with me!” His mom shouted while my mom turned a bright pink and tried to suppress a bark of laughter. I had a sinking feeling in my gut as Beverly looked over at her, then at Davey, and finally at me. Her direct gaze caused a slight blush to my cheeks while Sandy kept yelling at her son. “You know damn well what I mean! Has that boy tried to touch you sexually?” “Not that it’s any of your business if he had, but no, of course not.” Davey said with a snort and the room reverberated with the sound of her slapping him. “Don’t you dare talk to me like that!” His mother shouted. “His father came over and told me what a little pervert he is! You’ll have nothing to do with him any more, and I never want to see him over here again. People like him should be locked away from the rest of society…” “Sandy!” Bev shouted as my mother’s face began to grow red, not from the earlier humor but from real anger. “What is it?” Sandy snapped as Bev turned on her electric wheelchair and maneuvered herself to Sandy’s side while mother stood up. “What’s wrong with you?” Bev snapped as she hit Sandy in the side with her arm. Davey’s Aunt had been crippled from the neck down in an auto accident years ago, but she was still able to move her arms. Her hands she really couldn’t do much with, but she was deadly when she lashed out with her arms like that. “What’s that for?” Sandy growled, rubbing the spot where Bev had hit her. “How dare you talk about Sean that way!” Bev snapped. “He’s a good boy and you know that.” “I thought my husband was a good father and you see where that got me!” Sandy snapped back. “I’ll not have my son put in danger that way.” “Please tell me you don’t really feel that way.” Mom said sadly. Her anger was gone, replaced by a deep sense of sadness. “What does it matter if Sean’s gay?” “What?” Davey’s mother nearly squeaked with her surprise. “How can you say that Brenda? Homosexuals are perverts, one and all! It says so in the bible! What’s more, they’re all sick! Look at that AIDS thing! All homosexuals get AIDS and they die. If that Sean boy is a homosexual, he’ll have AIDS and I’m not going to risk my son being infected by him!” “Brian, get your things.” Mom said with a note of finality and I knew better than to argue with her right now. “What’s going on?” Sandy demanded imperiously. “I’m sorry, Sandy, but I cannot associate with someone who believes those things.” Mom said with a strong hint of sadness in her voice. “My brother Rich died of AIDS, and I will not listen to you insult his memory.” “You see!” Sandy said in a triumphant tone. “He probably got infected by homosexuals! That was his apartment, right? The one mom stayed at? He probably got it from them! Those homosexuals deserve every last bit of suffering God delivers to them.” “My Uncle Rich was the kindest, most caring person I’ve ever known.” I said through gritted teeth, remembering this woman caring for a young boy named Jeremy in another timeline. Suddenly I was homesick for that timeline, and I didn’t blame Sean one bit for not wanting to come back to this world. “I’m sure he was, but that’s what happens when you associate with homosexuals.” Sandy said. “I am ending our business relationship effective this moment.” Mom said through gritted teeth. “Why?” Sandy demanded with narrowed eyes. “Because Uncle Rich was gay, mother.” Davey said with a snort. “You can be so dense at times.” “I… um… look, I’m just overreacting.” Sandy began in an insincere apology. “Save it, Sandy.” Mom said angrily. “Right now I’m so angry nothing you can say will make a difference.” “But can’t you see that this is for the good of our boys?” Sandy asked in almost a whining tone. “We can’t have them perverted by that boy…” “Stop right there, Sandy.” Bev practically snarled, cutting off Davey’s mother who looked at her in shock. “Bev, you know that…” She started to protest. “I know that you’re not thinking, just reacting.” Bev snapped at her. “If you were thinking you’d have noticed something.” “What’s that?” Sandy snapped at her in frustration as she crossed her arms over her chest and glared at her sister-in-law sitting calmly in the wheelchair. “Doesn’t it strike you as odd that your son isn’t reacting in surprise at hearing that his friend is a homosexual, or that he knew that Brian’s uncle was one?” Bev asked and I cursed for not remembering how quick Davey’s aunt was. Sometimes I think he got the ability to think so quickly from her, instead of his mother or father. “What?” Sandy exclaimed in surprise while she turned to face her son who had gone slightly pale. “You knew about this and kept it from me?” “I… it wasn’t any of your business.” Davey said weakly and I had to flinch at the reaction on Sandy’s face. Part of me wanted to jump to his defense, but I knew this was his battle to fight, and I knew that I would not have been all too happy if either of our boys had spoken to me like that. “What do you mean it wasn’t my business?” She shouted and Davey did flinch in a major way this time. “How dare you say it isn’t my business? You’re my son and if something puts you in danger, it damn well is my business.” “I haven’t ever been in any danger, mother.” Davey said with sarcasm dripping from his voice. That did not bode well either. “Go to your room.” Sandy ordered. “I’ll deal with you later.” “No.” Davey said in firm, and flat, voice. “What do you mean no?” She demanded angrily. “You’re my son and as long as you live in my house you will do what I tell you!” “I’m seventeen, mother.” He said flatly in a voice that I knew foretold a lot of trouble. Unfortunately, his mother was so angry she probably didn’t recognize the tone. “If you want to go down this road, fine. I can leave.” “You leave this house and you’ll be cut off!” She shouted, growing flushed in the face. “Davey.” My mother said in a calm voice. Her face showed her worry. As she spoke the single word, she gathered the attention of everyone in the room. “What?” Davey asked in a harsh tone. It was obvious he was trying to not snap at her, which was a good thing. “I think everyone needs to take a deep breath.” My mother said in a slightly calm voice. “I thought you wanted nothing to do with me?” Sandy snapped waspishly at her. “I don’t, but your son and his relationship with you is a little more important than my anger at you for the moment.” My mother replied. “I don’t need your help to manage my son, Brenda.” Sandy sneered at her. “Don’t talk to her like that.” Davey snapped at her and she turned back to him and opened her mouth to deliver a tirade when Bev ran over her foot. “Ow!” Sandy shouted as she hopped around on her other foot, glaring at Bev who shrugged her shoulders. Davey had a tough time not bursting out in laughter, but he was hiding a big smile behind a hand. “I swear, Sandy, I get enough of this at home from my mother.” Bev said with an exasperated sigh as Sandy hopped around for another moment. She was glaring fiercely at Bev now, but her mouth was staying shut. “I’m sorry, Aunt Bev.” Davey said in a slightly meek tone. “You need to apologize to your mother.” Bev told Davey sharply. “For what?” His voice almost cracked and he looked stunned. “I thought you were on my side!” “I’m on no one’s side.” Bev retorted. “No matter what, she is your mother and deserves more respect than you’ve shown her tonight.” “You’re right.” Davey said after a long moment of thinking. He stood a little straighter and turned to face his mother. “I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you.” “What about what you said?” His mother retorted in a voice that sounded just as angry as before. “I’m not going to apologize for that.” Davey said firmly and she looked like she was about to go off on him again before Bev moved her wheelchair in a warning gesture. “We’re all intelligent people in this room.” Bev said softly and then she looked over at me with a penetrating stare. “Brian, you’ve been awful quiet. What do you have to say?” “I don’t know if anyone wants to hear my opinion right now.” I said with a shrug, trying to stay out of this mess. “I do.” Davey said softly. “I’d like to hear what he has to say.” My mother said just as softly and everyone turned to look at Sandy who stared at me for a long moment before also nodding. “If I was your parent and you spoke to me like that, I’d be pissed as hell.” I said to Davey and he looked hurt for a moment, before nodding slightly. Sandy looked triumphant until I turned to stare at her. “If I was your son, I’d be ashamed to be related to you.” “What?” Sandy gasped in surprise. “Have you given any thought to what Sean’s father hoped to accomplish by coming over here?” I asked her and her eyes widened in surprise. “Have you given a moment to think that there might be more to this story than you’re hearing from the man? If you had, you might have started this by asking some questions instead of assuming you knew everything you needed to know. If you’d done that you might have realized you were being played by that man.” “What do you mean?” Sandy asked with a hint of anger in her voice, but her eyes told me she was at least thinking. “Davey and I know a lot about Sean and what he’s been going through for the last couple of years.” I said softly. “Did you know that his father had him committed to a mental institution? Did you know that at that place they put electrodes on his penis and shocked him every time he showed any reaction to a picture of a man instead of a woman?” “That… that’s barbaric.” Sandy said with a shudder. “That’s what his father had done to him, and that was the nice stuff.” I continued mercilessly and she shook her head in disbelief. “He’s been kept isolated, he’s been forced to do so many disgusting things I don’t even want to think about them. That man hates his son and won’t rest until he’s made every minute of his son’s life miserable. In the last few weeks, Sean has actually had a few happy moments, most of them over here, and his father is trying to take that away from him.” “But… but the boy is a homosexual.” Davey’s mother protested. “Does that mean he deserves to be treated badly by his own parents?” Davey asked her and she looked at him for a second before turning back to me. “They realize that Sean’s old enough now that they don’t have long to control him.” I continued. “If he ran away again, and he’s done that a few times, they’d end up in trouble because Child Services down in Southern California investigated them. That’s one of the real reasons they moved back up here, so they wouldn’t be watched so much by the government for abusing their son.” “You’re kidding.” Sandy commented, but her voice showed she was believing me. “No, I’m not.” I stated. “Mom, Sean hates his parents now as much as they hate him.” Davey said in a much calmer voice. “The day he turns eighteen, he’s leaving their house. He doesn’t care if has to live on the street to get away from them, but the second he’s of legal age he’s walking out their door with nothing but the shirt on his back.” “And he’ll be better off for it despite having nothing.” I added and she looked horrified. “He’s just a boy, though.” Davey’s mother said. “It happens all the time, Sandy.” Brenda said softly. “Young men like him get thrown out of their homes, or leave because the situation is so unbearable, like it is for Sean, that they would prefer to be homeless than to live in that horror. Sean’s lucky, though. He’s got friends who are willing to stick up for him like Davey and Brian.” “But he’s a homosexual.” Sandy protested again, looking at her son. “I can’t have him putting you in danger.” “I’m in no more danger from him than Brian is from me.” Davey said and I had to do my best to not react to the implications of his words. Unfortunately, his mother caught them too, and the look on her face was filled with surprise, horror, and disbelief. Oh shit. Chapter 16 The silence in the room was deafening following Davey’s statement to his mother. The way she kept opening and closing her mouth made me think of a fish. My mother had gone pale, and Bev was staring at him with wide eyes. What surprised me the most was the calm look on Davey’s face. I had to wonder if he was going insane at that moment. “What are you saying?” Sandy asked Davey at long last. Her voice was weak, and I thought she might be on the verge of passing out. “If just being around Sean was a danger to me, then I must be a danger to Brian or anyone else I’m around, like Jenny for instance.” Davey said calmly and now I was growing more confused. What was the point he was trying to make? “Huh?” Bev asked in a voice that sounded every bit as confused as I felt. “What does Jenny have to do with this?” His mother asked sharply. Her temper was starting to flare up now. “Look at what Dad did to her.” Davey said softly. “I’ve been around Dad all my life. I idolized him, and he was molesting her all those years.” “That… that’s different.” Sandy said defensively. “That… what made your father do those things isn’t something you catch from just being around him.” “But Sean being gay is something I can catch?” Davey asked with a slight tilt of his head. “No, it’s not that.” His mother said defensively. “It’s the AIDS thing. You can catch that from him.” “Then I shouldn’t be around you either.” Davey countered and her face flushed with more anger. “Why do you say that?” She snapped. “You’re just as much at risk as Sean is, well more really.” Davey said to her and she looked stunned. “Sean isn’t having sex with guys, which is how he’d catch it. You had two blood transfusions during your surgeries. Look at that Ryan White kid. That’s how he got it, from a blood transfusion.” “I… how dare you?” She fumed, and she was starting to shake badly as she turned so she didn’t have to look at him. “Mom, I’m sorry.” Davey said softly and she turned back to look at him. “I know you don’t like to think about that, but it was a danger they told you about before the surgery. I know it worries you, but it’s there. If Sean being gay isn’t what puts me in danger from being around him, and you say it’s AIDS, you have to admit that your surgery makes you every bit as much a danger.” “It’s different.” She asserted. “How?” He asked her softly. “It just is.” She insisted, but she looked like she even knew the inanity of that argument. “I know that Sean being gay isn’t something you like, Sandy, but isn’t it his life?” My mother said in a gentle voice. “He’s Davey’s friend, Sandy.” Bev said softly. “I’ll admit, it doesn’t make me comfortable thinking about that… part of his life, but isn’t Davey the person who should decide if they stay friends or not? Davey’s almost an adult now, and he’s proven that he’s more than capable of acting like an adult.” “I wonder about that sometimes.” Sandy muttered as she looked at her son. “You don’t have to like him, Mother.” Davey said gently. “But he’s my friend and I’m not going to abandon him just because you don’t like him. If you don’t want him coming over here, fine. We’ll all go someplace else.” “That’s reasonable.” My mother said at once. “There’s no reason you boys can’t come over to the house, or go somewhere else. We don’t have a pool, but there are plenty of other things to do.” “I… I like having all of you come over here.” Sandy said defensively. “Either all my friends are welcome, or we can go someplace else.” Davey said firmly, but still in a gentle tone. “It’s not fair to any of them to be excluded like that.” “You’re really fine with Sean being a… homosexual?” Sandy asked my mother. “I loved my brother very much, Sandy.” My mother said gently. “Most of our family rejected him, but despite that he was still there for me when I needed help the most. No one else from my family lifted a finger to help me, but he did. I gave him a chance, and what I found was that he wasn’t really all that different because he preferred men. He still wanted to love someone, and to be loved. It’s not like what you see on television, at those parades you know. I mean sure, some are like that, but most gay people I’ve known in my life aren’t really like that. It’s just the news shows those people because they’re so…” “Outrageous.” I said when my mother faltered while looking for the right word. She nodded at me. “If he tries anything, you’ll tell me, right?” Davey’s mother asked him gently as her shoulders sagged in defeat. “Yes.” Davey promised and I sighed with relief of my own. For a moment, I had thought he had gone insane, but once again Davey had proved he could think better in tight situations than I could imagine. “Fine, why don’t you and Brian go do something?” She said with an air of defeat while she looked at my mother. “Brenda, I think the three of us should talk.” “Yes, we should.” My mother replied while Davey and I left their office. It struck me as odd that this was twice now, in two different timelines, that Sean’s father had caused an argument over his son to be fought out in this room. Davey sighed with relief as we headed up to his bedroom, not really saying anything until the door was shut and he was pulling me into a very tight hug. “Jesus that was close.” He mumbled against me while I put my arms around him even as his shoulders began to shake with gentle sobs. We stood like that for a while, he and I standing with our arms wrapped around each other while he cried into my shoulder. Finally he stopped crying and pulled back while I lowered my arms to my side. He wiped his eyes and gave me a small smile. “Thanks.” “Anything for you.” I said softly. “Do you mean that, Brian?” He asked me and I nodded my reassurance. “Good. I almost fucked up there big time.” “For a moment I thought you were going to tell your mother about us.” I said quietly and he chuckled softly while shaking his head. “That’s what I was going to do until I saw her face.” Davey stated. “When I saw her face I knew it’d be a mistake so I made up that other shit.” “That’s something I’ve always admired about you.” I told him. “You’re able to think so quickly on your feet like that. I’d have never been able to jump on that track about your father and her blood transfusion without having a lot of time to think about it first.” “Thanks.” Davey said as his smile slipped. “So you’ll understand what needs to happen now.” “What are you talking about?” I asked as a sliver of fear wormed its way to my gut. Where was his mind going now? “You and me, we can’t keep doing this, at least for now.” Davey said with a frown and I felt like I wanted to start shaking as my stomach dropped to my feet. “We can be friends, but nothing more. She can’t have any reason to suspect us.” “If you’re worried about her kicking you out…” I started to say but he shook his head. “That’s not it.” He said sadly. “I know your parents would give me a place with them. It’d kill my mother though, if she knew. I can’t have her looking at me like that, thinking those things about me. We’ll still be friends, though, and maybe after high school, when we’re in college we can pick up where we left off, but I can’t do this.” “You’re going to let your mother rule your life like this?” I asked him as my anger started to kick in and regretted it instantly. “You just said you’d do anything for me.” He shot back angrily. “Were they just words or did you mean them? I’m not kicking you out of my life, I’m just saying we need to keep it at the level of just being friends. What, you can’t stand the thought of not having sex?” “It’s not the sex I’m worried about, Davey.” I said sharply and he shook his head again. “Then what are you worried about?” He asked. “Davey, it’s wrong for you to put your life on hold for your mother and sister.” I argued. “That’s what you think.” He said with a hurt tone. “Look, you’re the one who said you always have to think things through. Well, go think about this. You’ll figure out I’m right. All we’re stopping is the sex, and the hugging and kissing stuff. We’re still going to be friends, right?” “Right.” I said with a heavy sigh. “I don’t like this Davey. What are you going to do next, date a girl?” “I might have to do that.” Davey said with a shrug. “Mom and Nanny are always asking me when I’m going to get a girlfriend. Nanny keeps pushing this Julie girl at me. Her mother is a volunteer at the hospital with Nanny. She goes to our school, so maybe I can date her and throw them off the track.” “She’s going to expect you to kiss her.” I warned him and he blushed. “It won’t mean anything, Brian.” He said with a heavy sigh. “It’s just maintaining my cover.” “I’m going to go.” I said abruptly as a feeling swept over me to get the hell out of there. The thought of Davey kissing anyone, whether he meant it or not, was too much for me to deal with right now. “Brian, please…” Davey’s voice trailed off with a hurt tone and I turned back to look at him. There were fresh tears in his eyes, but then there were new ones in mine too. “Don’t be mad. Just think about it.” “I will.” I said softly. “I’m not mad, though. I’m hurt, and I’m a little confused as to how you think this is best, but I’m not mad. I love you, Davey.” “I know.” He said softly, looking down at his feet as I shut his bedroom door behind me and made my way out of the house. It was a good thing that I didn’t run into anyone on the way out because by the time I got into my car, I was bawling like a little child. Several hours later my crying had turned into sniffling as I lay on my bed, clutching a pillow to my chest. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was going to lose Davey. No matter how similar this Davey was to the one I’d known and loved, even I had to admit they were very different people. My Davey had decades of experience this one didn’t have, and he’d told me the type of person he’d been at this age. How could I have been foolish enough to expect that this Davey would be faithful to me, would be willing to defy his family and risk their approval of him? “Brian, are you in there?” Mom’s voice from the other side of my door forced me to push back a few more sniffles, wipe my puffed-up eyes and focus back on the present. “I’m in here.” I said and was surprised at how much my voice shook. “Is everything alright, dear?” She asked in a worried tone and before I could say anything, she opened the door and took a very long look at me. “I thought something was up from the way you stormed out of there, and now I have a better idea of what’s going on.” “You do?” I asked in surprise. “What has Davey done now?” She asked with a sigh. “I swear, sometimes that kid can get as mixed up as his mother and grandmother. Does this have something to do with that Julie girl he’s supposed to be meeting for dinner tonight?” “Huh?” I mumbled in surprise as my heart dropped back down into my stomach again. Yep, that was Davey alright. Once he made a decision, he moved forward with it at full speed, and damn any of the consequences. “I was wondering why he was calling a girl to go out.” Mom said sadly. “Let me guess, he doesn’t want his mom to figure out about you two so he’s going to date this Julie girl. Do I have that about right?” “Yes.” I mumbled with a shake of my head. “Did you tell him how messed up that was and how much heartache it could cause?” She asked me. “No, not really.” I admitted softly. “I told him I don’t like it…” “Brian, for a guy who supposedly had experienced having grandchildren, you can spend a lot of time thinking like an ordinary teenager.” Mom said in an exasperated tone. “I’m not good at reacting to surprises.” I muttered miserably. He was already going out with Julie? A fresh batch of tears welled up in my eyes. “Oh my poor Brian.” Mom said sympathetically as those tears dribbled down my cheeks. She crossed the rooms and took me into her arms, where I cried hard enough to soak her blouse. I cried like that for a while, and when I slowed down, she started to dab my cheeks with a handkerchief. “Why don’t you go wash up while I start dinner. Don’t worry about Davey. We’ll all start working on talking some sense into him.” “Thank you, Mom.” I said, grateful once again to have my parents around. No matter how old I ever got, they were always a source of comfort and support for me. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep well that night, and the next day was a rough one for me. Trevor and Brandon showed up at my house, but they were surprised when I showed no interest in going over to Davey’s, or in doing anything else really. All I wanted to do was mope around for the day. They left after barely an hour, leaving me alone to work out on the weight machine that I had barely used in the last few months. We’d been using the sets at Davey’s. “What the hell is going on?” Todd’s voice interrupted me as he stormed onto the back patio just after noon. “What do you mean?” I asked him in a quiet voice. “I mean what’s up with you and Davey?” Todd spat back angrily. “He’s got some stupid girl named Julie over there making calf eyes at him and you’re nowhere around. His mom’s treating her like she’s the future daughter-in-law!” “Oh, Davey decided he’d rather pretend to be straight.” I muttered and Todd’s mouth hung open for a long time. For some reason that put a small smile on my face. “What are you smiling about?” Todd finally demanded. “You should be over there telling him he’s being an idiot!” “I was wondering if a fly really would fly into your mouth.” I chuckled and he shook his head. “Don’t change the subject.” He said sharply. “What are you going to do about that idiot? He’s already kissed her in front of everyone!” “He has?” I asked as my heart sank again. That was getting to be all too familiar a feeling. “Yes.” Todd said with disgust. “Then I guess he and I really are over.” I mumbled and Todd crossed his arms. “You’re only over if you let him do this stupid shit.” Todd said with determination and his foot was tapping on the cement. “Now I’ll ask it again, what are you going to do to stop his idiocy? He doesn’t belong with her, he belongs with you. Then again, if you’re available now, I think I might try pursuing you. You make a good boyfriend.” “I’m honored.” I said with a mocking bow of my head. “Sorry, Todd. You’re a good friend, but I’m not interested in you that way.” “Your loss.” Todd shrugged. “Do you want Davey back?” “Don’t be stupid, of course I do.” I growled. “He’s mine.” “Then you got to get him back.” Todd said as he started to pace. “Now, Davey’s as stubborn as his damn mother, so just talking to him won’t do any good. You’re going to have to make him jealous. I know! You can pick a girl and start dating her! Kiss her in front of him and let him see how it feels!” “I’m not going to lead some poor girl on that way.” I said with determination. “Well then, how about another guy?” He asked. “It’d have to be someone we already know, and you’ll have to do it carefully so no one outside our group knows. I see two choices, really. Me or Trevor.” “Why you or Trevor?” I asked with real curiosity. “Well, after they saw that there was a girl around, Brandon and Sean took off together.” Todd said with a sly grin. “I think they’re really hitting it off good.” “Good for them.” I said with genuine feeling. “I’m not sure about this jealousy thing though. It could really backfire.” “It won’t.” Todd said quickly. “You’d be willing to do this for me?” I asked him with a little surprise. “In a heartbeat.” Todd smiled. “Although if it was real, it’d be even better. You’re a good guy, Brian. But, if I can’t be your boyfriend I’ll take being your friend that helps you out whenever you need it.” “We don’t need to take it that far!” I said quickly as my cheeks blushed. “I know.” Todd teased me. “Davey doesn’t need to know that until later, though, right?” “No, no he doesn’t.” I agreed and Todd held out his hand. We shook then and he gave me a simpering glance. “So, should we practice kissing just to make it look real?” He asked with a hopeful tone. “Not just yet.” I said sternly. Now I had butterflies in my stomach. Part of me said this was stupid, that it could backfire so easily, but I also knew Davey and I didn’t want him sticking his dick in some girl just to secure his cover with his mother. It was three more days before I saw Davey again. After the second day where it was becoming evident Julie was a semi-permanent fixture, along with three of her girlfriends, everyone started meeting over at my house. >From there we’d go and do whatever we felt like that day, without Davey. The phone rang one morning, just after Mom had left for Sandy’s house and Dad had headed off to his work. I picked it up, and pretty much regretted it instantly when I heard Davey’s voice on the other line. Part of me wanted to hang up at his cheerful tone, but I didn’t. “What do you want?” I asked a little more harshly than I should have. “I… I want to see you.” Davey replied in a slightly weak voice. “I miss having you and the guys around. Did you tell them not to come over anymore?” “No.” I answered immediately. “Davey, they can’t be themselves with your… girlfriend and her friends around so they go where they’re more comfortable.” “So you didn’t tell them to stay away from me?” He asked plaintively. “No.” I replied. “I wouldn’t do something like that.” “Can we do something today?” He asked me in what was almost a whine. “I miss you already.” “What do you want to do?” I asked as the desire to see him overcame my anger for a moment. “We could go to the mall.” He said in a slightly happier tone. “Julie’s birthday is next weekend and I was thinking of getting her a necklace.” “Let me get this straight.” I said sharply as anger welled up inside of me. “You want to take the guy you dumped because your mother might guess we were a couple, and have him go with you to buy a necklace for some bimbo you’re seeing?” “Julie’s not a bimbo.” Davey said defensively. “No, I guess she’s not, but then neither am I.” I practically yelled into the phone before slamming it down. For several minutes I fumed, cussing out Davey and his idiotic thinking before deciding I really did need to do something. Trevor was doing something with his father today. Brandon was with his siblings and had Sean over, so that left Todd, whose crazy idea wasn’t sounding so bad just about now. “Hello?” Todd said as I called his number. “Hey, it’s Brian.” I said in a neutral tone. “Yo, dude, what’s up?” He asked in a happier tone. “I was wondering if you wanted to do something today.” I sort of asked him. “Uh, yeah, I was just sitting around.” He replied. “I’ve got the day off.” “Cool, how about I pick you up?” I asked. “About an hour?” “Fine by me.” He said happily and I hung up the phone. Almost exactly an hour later I was showered, shaved, and wearing a pair of khaki pants with one of my tightest blue t-shirts. “Where to?” He asked me as he got into the mustang. “How about the mall?” I asked with a perverse idea. Davey would probably be there, and even though I knew better, I wanted him to see me there with Todd. “Fine by me.” Todd said. “So, you hear from Davey lately?” “Yeah.” I said as my good mood evaporated. “Oh, how’d that go?” He asked. “He accused me of telling you guys to stay away from him.” I started off and Todd shook his head. “I told him you guys probably just weren’t comfortable with his girl and her friends there.” “That’s for sure.” Todd grumbled. “So, do you think Sean and Brandon are going to hook up?” “It’d be nice.” I answered. “You think they’ve actually done anything yet?” “They’ve fooled around.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Sean spent the next day praying on his knees for forgiveness, but as soon as Brandon called him he went right over. That boy is still mixed up in the head.” “Yeah, well, he has us to support him.” I stated. “Yup.” Todd agreed as he smiled at me again. “You think anymore about my idea?” “Yeah, I thought about it.” I said with a sigh. “And?” Todd asked with a tilt of his head. “Davey asked me to go to the mall with him to help him pick out a necklace for Julie.” I said sourly. “That stupid son of a bitch!” Todd exclaimed and then he started laughing. “We’re going to the mall, right?” “Yup.” I answered with a knowing grin. “You can be an evil man, Brian.” Todd smirked as he reached across the seat to rub my leg. “Todd, don’t take it too far.” I warned him with a little growl. “I know, I know.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Just remember, if Davey never fucking wakes up and smells the coffee, you’ve got lots of options.” “I know, and I appreciate that, Todd.” I said with a sideways glance at him. “I like you. You’re a good guy, but I don’t feel that way about you. Maybe we shouldn’t do this. You’ll only end up getting hurt.” “No, I won’t.” Todd said with a slightly pained expression. “Yeah, it’ll suck if it works and you two get back together, but for a little while at least I can pretend, and maybe I’ll have an idea about what it’ll be like when I do meet someone as nice as you.” “Fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” I said a little fiercely and he smiled as we pulled into the parking lot of the mall. Vintage Fair mall hadn’t been remodeled since it was built in the 1970’s, and still reflected some of the psychedelic décor of that time period. It’d be another fifteen years before it was remodeled and would get stores like Abercrombie & Fitch, or Hollister. Many of the same jewelry stores were there, and I couldn’t help but stop and point out a nice gold chain meant for a man to Todd. “I like that one.” He said to me just as Davey walked up to us. I’d noticed him on the other side of the mall and he’d been watching us as we went up to the jewelry store. “Is this why you wouldn’t come with me?” Davey snarled without any preamble and I turned to see him with a face reddened by his anger. “You decided to get yourself a new boy-toy and you’re going to buy him something now?” “What does it matter to you if he is?” Todd snarled back. “You’re the one who broke things off with him so you could pretend with that Julie girl.” “Don’t get in the middle of this.” Davey snarled at him while I looked around to see if anyone was close enough to hear us. “Davey, you might want to be careful or someone will hear us.” I said calmly. “You know what, fuck you Brian Breckenridge.” Davey snarled. “Not anymore.” I growled back at him and he stepped back while his eyes widened and Todd chuckled. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, Davey, you know exactly what I mean.” I told him. “It didn’t take you long to go from just using her as a cover to kissing her all over the place. Sean told me how she had her hand down your bathing suit the other day.” “I didn’t want her to do that!” Davey snarled defensively. “I told her to take it out as soon as it happened!” “No you didn’t.” Todd sneered. “You waited at least a minute until you noticed other people were seeing it happen.” “We used to do that stuff all the time and no one ever thought it was a big deal.” Davey said defensively. “You’re right, you can do it all you want.” I snarled at him, finally letting the anger I was feeling really vent out. “Just don’t expect me to sit around and wait for you to get bored.” “I thought you said you’d always love me.” He almost whined. “I will always love you, Davey.” I answered honestly, meeting his hurt gaze with a hurt gaze of my own. “What you have to understand is that I don’t have to live my life with you even though I love you. Sure, I wanted to live my life with you, but, you know, I don’t know if you’re worth it.” “What?” Davey nearly shrieked. “You come back in time for me and don’t think I’m worth it anymore?” “Huh?” Todd said in confusion and I stared at Davey as realization dawned on his face. “It’s a private joke.” Davey temporized quickly and Todd shook his head in confusion. “Brian told me one time he’d even come back in time for me if he had to.” “You guys can have some weird conversations, or at least you used to have them.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Shut up, dirtbag.” Davey told him sharply. “You couldn’t even wait a week before trying to sink your claws in Brian.” “Why not, you took less time than that to dump him for some cunt.” Todd sneered and Davey lashed out with a fist, catching Todd in the stomach and doubling him over. “That’s not what I did.” Davey said fiercely, but his eyes were pleading with me. “I have to do this. You understand, don’t you, Brian?” “I understand why you want to, but I don’t understand why you are stupid enough to think it’s the right thing to do.” I countered him while reaching out to support Todd who was clutching his gut. “I also don’t understand why you think it’s okay to hit Todd. I thought you were better than that.” “Maybe I’m just a stupid kid without decades and decades of growing up.” Davey sneered and I gave him a narrowed-eye look before shaking my head. “C’mon Todd, let’s get you out of here.” I said sadly as I walked away, supporting Todd and not even looking back at Davey Jones. Chapter 17 I was lying on the ground with a sharp pain in my midsection. My ears were ringing from the force my head had hit the grass with, despite the helmet, and it was hard to even breath at the moment. It was the last practice before our Championship game, and we were only wearing shoulder pads and helmets instead of full gear, and we most definitely were not supposed to be hitting each other this hard. “Jones, what the fuck is wrong with you?” Coach Cole snarled as he reached me and knelt down. Davey stood over me, probably glaring daggers at me like he’d done every time we’d seen each other for the last few months. Part of me had hoped he’d not play after all, and another part wanted to quit the team, but he was there and I wouldn’t quit just because of him. “Sorry coach.” Davey said around his mouth guard before turning and walking away. “You okay, Breckenridge?” Coach asked as he helped me sit up. “Just got the breath knocked out of me.” I said weakly. “What is it between you two?” Cole asked me with real concern. “Last semester you two couldn’t be pried apart with a crowbar.” “Yeah, well, things change.” I said as I got to my feet. Coach had to support me as I limped to the sidelines and Brandon went in to take my place. Two hours later I was pulling into the driveway of Davey’s house. I hadn’t been there since that day he’d ended our relationship to keep his mother from figuring out he was gay. If I had any choice, I wouldn’t be here now. “Yes?” The Housekeeper, a middle-aged Mexican woman asked when I rang the doorbell. “I’m Brian, Brenda’s son.” I said holding the box Mom had asked me to pick up at the airport. “Oh yes, come in.” The woman said with a slight smile. “She’s in the office. I’ll show you the way.” “I know it.” I said grimly. It felt weird being in here, like I was an interloper. At least Davey wasn’t here. Neither was my mother, I discovered as I entered the room that had once been President Jones’s study. Davey’s mother was in there alone, doing some paperwork. “Brian!” She exclaimed with a smile as I entered. “Good, you got it. Why don’t you put it over there on the table?” “Sure, Mrs. Jones.” I said softly as she pointed to a side table. I put the box down, wiping my hands on my jeans and turned, preparing to leave. “How have you been, Brian?” She asked me before I could escape. “I’ve been well, ma’am.” I said simply, hoping she’d let it go at that. “I haven’t seen you in ages.” She said and I realized I was in for the full questioning. “I’ve been busy.” I said softly. “That’s what Davey’s said.” She stated with a frown. “He’s been miserable, you know. He won’t tell me what caused you boys to fight.” “It’s a guy thing.” I said quickly and she frowned. “I haven’t seen that Sean boy around here much, either.” She said. “Did that have something to do with it? I thought it was agreed it would be okay if he came over as long as he didn’t… do anything.” “He isn’t comfortable over here.” I said, hoping this was a way to get her to let me go. “I think he knows he’s not really wanted over here and he’s nice enough to not push himself where he’s not wanted.” “I see.” She said with a deeper frown. “You know that had nothing to do with you, right? I’d hate to think that Davey’s best friend abandoned him because of something his mother said.” “I…uh…” I stammered, not able to find anything to say that wasn’t a lie or too close to the truth. “You know that Davey does miss you, don’t you?” She asked. “I mean, he’s been doing poorly in school without someone to study with, and all those girls he’s been dating haven’t done much to help him concentrate on his books. I’m starting to worry he might not be able to get into a good school if he keeps this up.” “With all due respect, that’s his problem.” I said a little more forcefully than I should have. Davey had dumped Julie two weeks into the school year, and was now dating Heather, one of the cheerleaders running for Homecoming Queen. Davey was rumored to be the favorite for King this year. “Why are you so angry with him, then?” She asked directly. “After everything he went through where you supported him, I can’t understand why you would turn your back on him when he’s finally getting his life put together.” “Maybe because I disagree with how he’s going about doing that.” I said with a shrug. It was time this conversation ended. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some more errands to run. It was nice seeing you again.” “Don’t be such a stranger, Brian.” She murmured as I left the room. Unfortunately I didn’t make it out of the house in time, because Davey was walking in with Riley from the football team, and both Heather and Riley’s girlfriend, Marsha were following behind. “Oh, hi.” Davey said as he saw me in the entranceway. “I was just leaving.” I said shortly and moved to push my way through them, garnering a glare from Riley and a look of confusion between the two girls. “What is it with him?” I heard Heather ask from behind. “Brian, wait!” Davey called out before I’d gone three steps to my car. He said something under his breath to the others and shut the door behind him as he caught up with me. “I’m sorry about the hit today. It was wrong of me.” “Apology accepted.” I said simply, not looking at him. “Is that all you have to say?” He asked in a hurt tone. “What else is there to say?” I asked him. “You made it quite clear already. You don’t want to risk your mom knowing about what used to be between us, I don’t want to live a lie, watching you make out with some girl all the time.” “It doesn’t have to be this way.” Davey said in a hurt voice. “I miss you.” “You’re right, it doesn’t have to be this way.” I said turning around to look at him. He looked shocked by the anger in my eyes. “You chose your path, I chose mine.” “Are you and Todd really going out or is it just to make me jealous?” He asked. “We’re planning on going to Arizona State together.” I said with a shrug. “Why?” He asked with a frown. “You remember my plan for the future?” I asked him and he nodded. “Well after the incident at the mall, I decided I could trust him and I told him everything. He’s going to help me, and that’s why we’re going to Arizona State. It’s part of the plan.” “I was going to help you…” Davey’s voice drifted off and his hurt look deepened. “You know, this is just until after high school, or maybe after college, once I don’t need Mom’s support anymore. We can get back together then.” “Have you fucked any of those girls yet?” I asked him pointedly and he blanched. “Have you fucked Todd yet?” He demanded of me. “No, we’re good friends, not lovers.” I replied. “Todd wants more, and who knows, maybe after you’re out of my life once and for all, I might like him that way, but for now, no.” “I haven’t had sex with any of the girls.” Davey said softly and there were tears in his eyes. “That’s why I keep breaking up with them. They want to go further than I’m willing.” “Just how far are you willing to go with them?” I snapped, not really wanting to know the answer. “Julie’s the only one to get so far as her hands down my pants.” Davey said defiantly, as if daring me to disbelieve him. “Why not?” I asked him. “Do you really have to ask that?” His voice quaked slightly. “Yes.” I answered. “Because I’m still in love with you and I don’t want anyone but you!” He nearly shouted, and then looked horrified at how loud he’d reacted. With fear, he looked around and only relaxed slightly when he realized no one was around. When he turned back to me, he looked slightly ashamed, but also determined to say something. “Why? Brian, why did you react like this?” “If you love someone you don’t dictate to them.” I said softly. “When you decided this was what you wanted, you were dictating to me the terms of our relationship. I’m not stupid enough to let you turn our relationship into a one-way street.” “I didn’t… that’s not what I wanted to do!” He protested. “It’s what you did.” I replied. “If you wanted to make it a one-way street, well two can play that game, Davey. I love you, I love you a lot, but that love does not give you the right to treat me like a doormat.” “You still love me?” He asked with a look of hope. “I will love you until the day I die, and probably even beyond that if there’s a way.” I said to him with all my heart. “But you’re still not going to take me back?” He asked. “Not like this, no.” I said. “I’m sorry Davey, I’d be willing to come up with something to work around your fears with your parents, but I won’t be dictated to, and that’s what you wanted.” “So, if I said it differently we could still work things out?” He asked hopefully. “Not at this point.” I said with a sad shake of my head. “Maybe back when this all began. No, don’t say anything. I made a couple of mistakes too, like that trip to the mall. It takes two to tango, and we were both ready to dance. But, now we’ve made our beds, separately, and we’ll have to live with them.” “I don’t want a life without you.” He said miserably. “But you put your mother and family as being more important.” I said simply. “I understand that, Davey, I really do. They mean more to you than anything else, including your own life. That’s fine, really, if you want to live your life as a slave to their expectations, their goals, and their desires, that’s your prerogative. Just don’t expect me to go along for the ride.” “I…” He started to say before he fell silent. “Goodbye, Davey.” I said before turning and heading back to my car. It had a feeling of finality to it, and my eyes were clouded with tears by the time I pulled out of the driveway and headed home. When I saw Todd’s car already there waiting for me, it was actually a relief, and he followed me inside the empty house without bothering to say a word. He’d seen the look on my face, and knew I’d spend the next thirty minutes with his arms wrapped around me while I soaked his shirt with more tears. It had happened often enough, and we didn’t even bother going further in the house than the entryway before I bent over and cried into his shoulder. He was a lot shorter than me, which meant that by the time I was done, my neck and back was sore, but I was grateful. When his lips locked on mine as I tried to straighten up, I was caught totally by surprise. Sure, I knew he still carried a torch for me, but he’d never tried this before. Still, there was something in that touch, that kiss that lit a fire inside me. I had been without this since Davey and I had… broken up, and it felt good as we kissed. Not nearly as good as Davey, but still… “No.” I said as I finally broke away from the kiss. “No, what?” Davey’s harsh voice surprised me and I turned to see him standing inside the doorway, a look of anger and pain on his face. “Oh shit.” Todd said softly, moving out of my embrace even as I stepped back as well. “So, I thought you said the two of you weren’t more than friends.” Davey snarled at me as anger totally replaced the look of hurt. “It’s nice to know I can be as stupid as my mother when it comes to believing the men I love.” “Davey, it’s not like that.” Todd said before I could even think of a single thing to say. “I kissed him. It was the first time!” “How was it?” Davey snarled his question at me as he clenched and unclenched his fists. “Not the same.” I said with a sad look at him. “I’m sorry Todd, but I don’t love you.” “It was worth a try.” Todd said with a shrug. “But then, I didn’t expect to get caught by him.” “Of course you didn’t.” Davey sneered. “Why should I come over here anymore? Tell me Todd, how much of this has been your idea?” “Davey, stop that.” I said sharply. “We’ve got enough problems between us that you don’t need to make new ones.” “Yeah, well I was coming over to see if that offer of always having a place to stay here still stood, but I don’t know now.” Davey snarled again. “I don’t know if I can stand to see all of our friends trying to get down your pants.” “Like you expected me to stand around and watch all those girls do the same to you?” I snapped back at him before the import of his words hit me. “What do you mean if you could stay here?” “Mom’s kicked me out.” Davey snapped with a look of hurt. “Why would she do that?” Todd asked with a perplexed look. “Because I’m a fucking pervert as bad as my father.” Davey snarled angrily, but there were tears in his eyes. “What happened?” I asked with real concern as my anger washed away in the blink of an eye. I took a step towards him, and he responded by stepping towards me before he fell into my arms, crying on my shoulders. It was a long time before he could make any sounds that were intelligible. Todd helped me guide Davey towards a couch, and got a box of tissues for Davey to blow his nose once he calmed down. “She confronted me after you left.” Davey said softly as he clutched my hand. We were now sitting side-by-side with Todd in a chair across from us. “About what?” “About you, about me, about what I did to keep you away.” Davey said sadly. His shoulders shook a bit more, and his voice was quivering. “She kept harping on me in front of Riley and Heather and Jennifer. I snapped. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told her, right there in front of everyone.”",

I was surprised though when he got a pensive look on his face. “Brian, can I ask you something?” “Sure.” I said casually, but there was a sudden tightening in my gut. That look on his face meant he was thinking of something unpleasant. “You’re from a future, but you say the future isn’t set in stone.” Davey said slowly as though he was thinking aloud more than anything. “Some things will be the same, but other things will be different, right? That’s how… that is how you can plan to make some changes, to make the world a better place.” “That’s right.” I said softly. “But you can’t guarantee it will work.” Davey continued his thought process aloud. “You mentioned how one of the other timelines the other me created, it ended in nuclear war, which was when they created the timeline you came from.” “You got it correct.” I confirmed for him. “The same thing could happen here, if we’re not careful, although it’s pretty late in the timeline for something like that. It was other time travelers that really precipitated that war, and their attempt to control the secrets of time travel. That secret’s dead now. I don’t know nearly enough to make another machine. In a couple of years, the Soviet Union will cease to exist, and while there’s still threats of a city being blown up, or minor stuff like that, it’ll be decades before China gets close enough to having the technology to instigate a war that could threaten the entire planet.” “Yeah, but doesn’t that mean that you can’t absolutely predict certain things?” Davey asked slowly. “You can’t tell me my mom will live to be an old woman, or that my sister won’t die in a car accident, or even that you or I won’t die in an accident.” “Life would be kind of boring if we knew everything that was going to happen, wouldn’t it?” I asked him and he chuckled softly. “Uh huh, but really, Brian, what makes us any better suited to changing the world?” Davey asked me in a quiet voice. “Anything can happen, right? How do we know we’ll be happy, and that we’ll do what we set out to do?” “Right now the Governor of Arkansas is biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to go after his lifelong dream of becoming President.” I said in a firm, but quiet voice. “He’s going to win in 1992, ending twelve years of Republican rule from the White House. There’s many things he will want to do in office and while he’s President, this country – and the world will change from the Cold War era into a new era. He’ll succeed at a lot of things while in office, and fail at others, but in the end his most memorable feat in office will be that he was impeached because he lied about getting a blow job from an intern.” “You’re kidding!” Davey’s voice cracked and his eyes were wide. “Nope.” I said smugly. “Well, that’s what he’ll be remembered for if he doesn’t get some good advice and follow it while he’s President. Still, the guy’s been dreaming since he met John F. Kennedy that he would one day be President, and he’ll succeed, but he’ll be remembered for being impeached over a lie, more than anything else.” “What does that have to do with…” Davey’s voice drifted off while I smiled. “It means I don’t know if we’ll succeed, but I know we should try, and I know that we should be careful not to get tripped up by stupid things along the way.” I answered. “I also believe that if Bill Clinton didn’t run in 1992, we might have been worse off than we were with him in office. The bottom line is that we have to try, and no, we’re not guaranteed to win, but if we don’t try, there will be no chance that things are better. I can’t promise you anything, except that I’ll always love you, and I’ll always be there for you.” “Unless you die in a car accident.” Davey pointed out and I had to nod. “Well, I’ll just have to make sure that if you are in an accident, I’m there with you so I won’t have to see what happens without you around.” “I…” I lost my voice at that and he smiled before stepping closer to me and kissing me on the lips. “We better go see what Mom’s up to.” He said with an impish grin before walking out. I followed him, thoroughly confused about the whole point of all this talking, but decided to just stop worrying and see what was in store for me. “This will make a great office for the both of us.” Davey’s mother was saying to my mother as we found them standing in front of the room that I had always thought of as President Jones’s private office. For some reason her words sent a pang of regret through me. I still had not met the man in this timeline, and part of me didn’t want to meet him. “If you think so, Sandy.” Mom answered with a grin. “This house is wonderful, and it is so close to ours.” “Good, then it’ll be easy for us to get together here.” Mom said as Pete came around the corner with the realtor trailing behind him. “You sure you want this place?” Pete asked Sandy who nodded. I knew it was an act on Pete’s part as he sighed before turning to the realtor. “If she’s so set on the place, I guess we’ll take it, but we’re not paying a dime over four-twenty.” “I’ll have to talk to the seller, but I think he’ll agree.” The realtor said with a slightly oily smile. That was a good thirty thousand less than the asking price, so Pete must have done some good bargaining, but it looked like the deal was made. “We’d better get heading back.” Pete said. “Mom should be home with the baby by now.” “Let’s go.” Sandy said before calling out for her daughter. Sandy and Mom took Sandy’s RX-7, while I got to drive Davey and the girls back and Pete took his own van back to Ceres. “Can we stop at Foster’s Freeze on the way?” Jenny asked petulantly as we neared Ceres. Her and her friends had done nothing but chatter away the entire time, while Davey and I had pretty much remained silent. “Sure.” I said with a sigh. She was always wanting something extra, no matter what we did, and as I expected, it was Davey who paid for the slushies at the Foster’s Freeze. We got back to Pete and Monta’s house just in time to see a strange man get out of his car, wearing a suit, and walk up to Sandy, who was standing in the driveway talking to Pete and my mother. “Who’s that?” Jenny asked as I parked and we got out of the car just in time to hear Sandy start shouting at the man, who walked away quickly, holding a clipboard and shaking his head. Davey rushed forward to his mother’s side. “What’s wrong?” He asked her. “Your good-for-nothing father!” Pete snapped while Sandy held out a packet of papers to Davey. “The bastard is suing me!” Sandy snarled angrily. “What?” Jenny half-screeched. “Why?” Davey asked as he took the papers and started riffling through them. I looked over his shoulder and read that Sandy was being sued by her estranged husband for half of the lottery money. “Just because I haven’t gotten around to divorcing him yet he’s saying he deserves half of my money!” Sandy half-yelled, but she was near hysterical as my mother put a comforting arm around her. She turned and started crying into Mom’s shoulder. “He can’t do this.” Davey snarled angrily as he shoved the papers at his grandfather who was giving him a stern gaze. “Davey, don’t do…” Pete started to say, but Davey wasn’t listening. Instead, Davey was storming away, half-running down the street. With a glance at Mom I started after him. “Davey…” I called out when I got close to him, halfway to his other grandmother’s house. She lived right around the corner, and it was a very short distance. “Don’t try to stop me.” Davey fumed without slowing down as I pulled abreast of him. “I’m not going to do that.” I said firmly. “Still, let’s walk, okay?” “Why?” He asked. “So you have a few extra minutes to think about what you’re going to say instead of just spouting off at him.” I answered. He stopped suddenly and gave me a long look. “You’re not going to try to stop me?” He asked. “No.” I answered simply. “I’ve got your back. This is wrong of him to try to do this.” “Oh.” Davey said softly and then cocked his head as he looked at me. “What do you think I should say?” “I don’t know.” I shrugged. “The man I knew would never do something like this, so you know him better than me. Plus, I always like to think things through before I do something. You’re the one who things on his feet really well, as long as you take a few minutes to run things through your head first. Me, I’d take a day or two to get something half as decent as what you can put together in a few minutes.” “Okay.” Davey said with a curt nod of his head. “He’s doing this because… well because money has always been tight for grandma. He’s living there with her, Aunt Bev, Ron, and Bryan, and he’s having to work at McDonald’s, which I know he hates. He thinks it’s beneath him. Mom’s got this huge pile of money, and if she shared it with him, he’d not have to do that.” “Do you think he’s even talked to her?” I asked Davey and he nodded. “She told him no way in hell was he touching any of her money.” Davey answered. “What can you do?” I asked him and he took a deep breath. “He loves me.” Davey said softly. “Dad hates the fact that we don’t get along like we used to, and that I hardly ever go visit him.” “That’s not your fault.” I affirmed and he shook his head. “That still doesn’t change the fact that he misses that.” Davey said. “Okay, I think I know what I’m going to say.” “Good.” I said as he started walking, but he stopped again and turned to look at me with a little smile on his face. “Thanks.” He said quietly. “You’re welcome.” I replied with a return smile. “It’s… I know we don’t talk about… about being in a relationship a lot, mostly because it makes you uncomfortable, but this is what I want. I want us to be able to depend on each other for advice, and to help each other out.” “I… I think I could get use to this.” Davey said with a husky voice and he squeezed my arm once before turning to walk towards his grandmother’s. “You coming?” “I’m right behind you.” I said affectionately and he chuckled. Soon enough we were walking up the driveway to his grandmother’s. Her old white and brown Chrysler was parked on the right of the driveway, while an ugly brown van was parked on the left and a boat was in the grassy area next to the left side of the driveway. The little red 1979 Toyota pickup that Davey’s father had bought years ago from Pete was parked on the side of the road in front of the house. It seemed everyone was home. “Davey!” Davey’s paternal grandmother nearly shouted when she answered his knock on the door. “What a surprise! Oh look at you!” “Hi Grandma.” Davey said as the woman pulled him into a tight hug. She was shorter than him, and looked a lot younger than the last time I’d seen her in 2007. “Is Dad home?” “DAVID!” She shouted before releasing Davey. “Oh Davey! We haven’t seen you in weeks! What have you been up to? Who is this?” “Grandma, this is my friend Brian.” Davey said politely. “Brian, this is my grandma.” “It’s nice to meet a friend of Davey’s.” She said excitedly to me. “You boys come on inside and let me fix you something to eat!” “I’m just here to talk to my father.” Davey said firmly, letting his anger show a bit and she frowned immediately. “It’s about your mother, isn’t it?” She said sourly. “She got her papers today. Well, if that’s what it takes to bring you over here, I say your father should sue her every damn day! I swear, that woman! First she ruins our family, airing our dirty laundry for everyone to see and then she goes and wins the lottery and refuses to share the money like a good wife should! If I had that bitch in front of me right now I’d…” “Stop it.” Davey growled and she frowned at him. “Well, if that’s the way you’re going to talk to me, your grandmother, I don’t want you coming inside this house!” She snarled and stepped back as the sound of footsteps could be heard coming down the hallway. Davey’s father appeared behind her, his hair still wet from the shower he must have been taking when we showed up. “Davey!” He said with excitement and a broad grin while I took in the differences between this man and the one I remembered from another time. This David Jones Sr. was overweight, and had a bushy mustache that he’d never worn in the time I’d known him in that other timeline. “I need to talk to you.” Davey said firmly, ignoring his grandmother’s noises of distaste and staring at his father. His entire body was tense. “Who is this?” His father asked, nodding in my direction. “This is my best friend, Brian.” Davey answered. “Can we talk out here?” “Uh, sure.” His father said as Davey and I took a few steps back and down so we were off of the front porch. As he stepped outside he turned to his mother. “I’ll be just a few minutes, mother.” “You put him in his place, David!” She snarled before slamming the door behind him. He shook his head and turned to look at Davey. “I take it your mother was served?” He asked and Davey nodded. “You want to talk about this in front of him?” “He and his parents bought Mom the winning lottery ticket as a gift.” Davey said through gritted teeth as he stared his father down. “His family let us use their apartment in the city when Mom was going through her surgery. I’ve stayed at his place for the last few months, and his mother his going into business with Mom. As far as I’m concerned he’s a part of my family.” “I see.” David Jones Sr. said as he gave me an appraising look. “I appreciate everything your family has done for my son and my wife.” “She’s only your wife because she hasn’t gotten the nerve up yet to actually file for divorce.” Davey snarled. “Maybe now you’ve finally pushed her far enough she’ll file the damn paperwork.” “Watch your language young man!” Davey’s father snapped at him. “You’re still my son!” “You may have sired me, but you’ve long since given up any right to be a part of my family.” Davey shot back angrily. “Only because your mother refused to…” David Jones started to say, but Davey cut him off. “She refused to forget what you did to Jenny, how you did what no father should ever to do to his daughter, and she refuses to live a lie just so you can save face.” Davey shot back. “We were married before God, and you can’t just turn your back on that when things don’t go right.” His father retorted. “This is a little beyond ‘irreconcilable differences.” Davey snorted. “You don’t deserve her.” “How dare you say that?” Davey’s father nearly shouted as his face turned purple. “I don’t know how you think you can talk to an adult, much less your father that way but I won’t stand for it!” “I can talk to you this way because you’ve long since lost any right to deal with me as a parent to his child.” Davey’s voice dropped an octave and his hands balled up into a fist. “When you touched my sister the way you did, you gave up any and all rights to deal with me as a parent. The most you can ever hope for is that one day I’ll be ready to forgive you and we might develop a relationship as adults. When you did what you did to Jenny, you did more than just molest her. You destroyed our family. You forced Mom to make decisions no wife or mother should ever have to make, and you forced me to assume the responsibilities of an adult. Or have you forgotten that it has been me, not you, whose been paying the bills for Jenny’s psychotherapist?” “I haven’t… you can’t blame me that no one will hire me after it was in all the papers…” His father said weakly. “Now you try to take what Mom has luckily been given thanks to Brian and his parents?” Davey continued in that low, vicious tone. “Is that how you plan to prove to me that you’re worthy of being a part of my life?” “What?” David Jones Sr. asked with real confusion in his eyes. “You do want to earn my approval, my respect, and maybe have some reconciliation with me and Jenny, don’t you?” Davey asked calmly. “Of course I do…” His father replied, but stopped as Davey stared at him silently. “Is this the best way to do it?” Davey asked him and the older man stared at his son for a long time. “When did you get so wise?” David Jones asked his son. “I did listen, you know.” His son stated in a voice that was void of the anger that had been there earlier. It was still quiet, but there was a softness to it that had not been evident until now. The older man’s head jerked up a bit and he gave his son a quizzical look. “When you were preaching. I listened. When I was younger, I remember you preaching about Jesus and how he acted when the Roman soldiers came to arrest him. Remember in Waterford when Sampson was beating me up? I could have fought back anytime, I could have pummeled him, but I didn’t because I remembered you teaching how violence was not the answer according to Jesus.” “You did fight him eventually, and you won.” David Sr. said with a slight smile while I stared in surprise at Davey. I’d never heard this story before. “You and he were the best of friends for a long time, until we moved back to Modesto.” “Yes, but I didn’t fight him until he hit April.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. “He’s in Modesto now.” David Sr. said calmly. “I saw him the other day. His parents moved to Modesto last year.” “Oh.” Davey said softly before shaking his head. “My point, Dad, is that I did listen to your sermons. There was a lot of good in them, and I’m a better person for having listened to them. When… when we came back and I was old enough to work, I got a job so we could afford Jenny’s sessions. No, don’t look like that. This is not an attack on you for not being able to pay for it. I do understand why you couldn’t, but because of what I learned from your sermons I didn’t hesitate to do the right thing when it was needed.” “I… I can’t say how proud of you I am for that.” His father said in a quiet tone and Davey cocked his head to the side while looking at his father. “Then why don’t you practice what you use to preach?” He asked his father and the older man flinched before frowning. “I… I… you don’t understand.” David Sr. replied softly. “Your grandmother’s had to take a second mortgage out on the house because of the legal bills, and Bev’s medical bills. Your Aunt was in the hospital for a few weeks there, you know.” “No, I didn’t, and I should have.” Davey said softly. “She’d like to see you.” David Sr. said softly. “Maybe I will, before I leave.” Davey said quietly. “Still, does any of that justify you doing this to Mom?” “I… no, it doesn’t.” David Sr. said softly. “It’s just… you know how your grandmother can be.” “Yes, but that doesn’t justify you giving in to her.” Davey said firmly. “I have to live here, damn it!” His father snapped and Davey did look sympathetic for a moment. “I’d be ready to kill her if I had to live here for more than a few months.” Davey snorted and his father chuckled softly. “Look, Dad, I didn’t know about the mortgage and all that. Maybe I can talk Mom into helping with that. She loves Bev still, you know.” “I know.” Dad sighed. “Sometimes I feel guilty because the two of them have been friends since high school and now Sandy can’t even talk to her on the phone.” “Dad, you don’t deserve half the money, but Mom won’t ignore a real need over here like this.” Davey said in a quiet but firm voice. “Let me talk to her, give me some time.” “Okay, son.” David Sr. said with a sigh. “Your grandmother might kill me, but I’ll drop the suit.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Now, why don’t you come and say hello to your aunt?” His father asked. “Brian, you’re going to love my Aunt Bev.” Davey said with a bright smile as he turned to me. “Just be careful or she’ll run you over with her wheelchair.” “Okay.” I said with a smile of my own while my feet winced in remembered pain. Okay, maybe these feet didn’t remember the pain of her wheelchair running over them, but I did have those memories, and the woman could be quite vicious when she wanted to make a point. Chapter 15 It was amazing what a simple apology could do. Some people have made a science of apologizing, both now and in the future. Certainly for anyone in the public spotlight knowing how to give the correct apology at the correct time was an important thing to know. Sometimes a bouquet of flowers with a simple note saying “I’m Sorry” would heal over a spat between lovers. It could be a box of chocolates, or a special trip including a favorite activity of the person being apologized to would work. Other times, giving a good apology required a complicated series of events, or endless repetition. There were people who didn’t want to hear a simple “I’m Sorry.” They want to hear you explain why you’re sorry, and what you did wrong first, and then the words. Still others wouldn’t listen to any apology at all, but rather required a long series of actions before they would accept the apology. David Jones Sr. had a lot to apologize for in this timeline, and he had a lot of people to whom he needed to apologize. Each of them required a different style of approach, a different form of apology, and none of them were inclined to forgive him anytime soon. The little stunt with the aborted attempt to get some of Sandy’s lottery money had only made the hurdles higher, and I was both surprised and pleased when he started making overtures right away. The next Saturday after Davey confronted him, he walked over to Pete and Monta’s house. Dad and I had been invited by Pete to join him and Davey on a fishing trip. It had been a good trip, and we’d come back in the late afternoon with the legal limit of fish. Davey’s father showed up just as we finished unloading the van, and Pete tensed up, as did Davey, but it was Davey who went to confront his father while Pete watched warily. “What do you want?” Davey asked sternly. “I… I would like to speak to your mother.” David Sr. said in a cautious voice. “Why?” Davey’s voice dripped with suspicion. “These are the official papers dropping the lawsuit.” His father answered while holding up a sheaf of papers in his hands. “I’ve also got papers filed for starting the divorce proceedings, if she wants. This way she doesn’t have to pay for anything.” “Okay.” Davey said with a hint of anger in his voice and he turned back to look at his grandfather who stared at the two of them for a long moment before nodding. “I’ll go get her.” Pete said gruffly and walked into the house. Sandy came out a few minutes later with an apprehensive look on her face. “Pete says you have something for me, Dave.” She said frostily and her husband handed over one set of papers. “Here’s the papers dropping the suit.” He said to her. “It was wrong of me to file them. I have no right to any of that, and I’m sorry.” “You’re damn right you have no right.” Sandy snarled, but she also relaxed a bit as she took the papers. “What made you do it?” “My mother.” He said with a heavy sigh and she actually laughed briefly before shaking her head. “That doesn’t make me any less responsible. I’m the one who did it, even if she was pushing me. It’s my responsibility.” “It’s about damn time you took responsibility for your mistakes.” Pete grumbled from where he stood behind Sandy. David Jones Sr. just nodded, agreeing with Pete and forcing a look of surprise to the older man’s face. “I… I also have papers here to start the proceedings for a divorce.” David Sr. said and Sandy gasped slightly. “You want a divorce?” She said in a voice that sounded horrified. “No, I don’t, but you might.” He said softly. “I’ve made so many mistakes, done so many things wrong I can’t blame you if you want one, but I know that before you couldn’t afford one. You can now, but I am the one who’s brought us to this point in our relationship, I’m the one who destroyed our family, and I’m the one who should take this step, or at least offer it to you if it is what you want. You’ve done nothing wrong. In fact, you’ve been doing things right, the way I should have. You’ve put the needs of the kids first, and put a stop to–to the things that I was doing that were wrong.” “I… put those away.” Sandy said to him with a weak voice. “I’m not saying I won’t want a divorce, but not right now. You’ve never… you’ve never accepted responsibility for what you did before. Your daughter needs to hear you say that.” “She will, whenever you and she are ready.” He replied in a voice that shook only a little bit. “Thank you, Dave.” She said in a quiet, but clear dismissal. “You deserve it, and more.” He said before turning to go. He took two steps before stopping and turning back. “Sandy, I almost forgot. Bev wanted me to say she misses you and Jenny. Would it be okay for her to come and visit?” “Anytime.” Sandy replied evenly and he nodded before resuming his course back to his mother’s house. When he was out of sight, Sandy turned and buried her head against Davey’s chest while she shook with her sobs. Dad touched my shoulder and nodded towards the house. I followed him and Pete inside while Davey comforted his mother. As spring turned into summer, that day marked a turning point for Davey and his family. It took another three weeks for them to move into the new house. During that time, Davey would stay with us during the week, and my room often reeked of the sex we would have in there at night, but on Friday night he’d go back to Pete and Monta’s house and not return until Sunday night. I found that I was okay with that, because it gave me time to rebuild my friendship with Brandon and Trevor, as well as to continue getting to know Todd better. The weekend where Sandy, Davey, and Jenny moved into their new home saw all of us showing up to help out with the move. Sandy had bought a bunch of new furniture for the house, and had spent the last few weeks totally revamping not only her wardrobe, but her childrens’ as well. Davey looked quite good in the matching outfits she bought for him, as did Jenny. To my surprise, David Sr. was also there, helping out with the move, as were Bev’s son Bryan and Bev herself – although she spent much of the time in her wheelchair directing everyone where to put things. When our Junior year of high school ended, Davey had a big party at his house with most of his friends, and several of mine. Sandy wasn’t there that weekend, and Davey shocked me when he told me that she was in San Francisco for the weekend with his father. I knew that they had started going to counseling with Jenny’s therapist as a family, but I hadn’t known things were going in the direction of his parents getting back together. I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but both Davey and his sister seemed to be happy with that development. In July, Davey got to spend two weeks with Brandon, Trevor, and me at a football camp in Minnesota. At first he was the worst player at the camp, but by the end of the two weeks, he had progressed so far that I was confident he’d make first string on the Varsity team at school. We made a good team on defense together, and while I knew he’d never been into baseball the way it was in the last timeline, I could see the abilities that had made him a good player shining through with some concentrated training and attention. It was a few days after we got back from football camp that things changed yet again. His mother had bought some excellent weight equipment and put it on their spacious back patio just like in the last timeline. Three days a week, I’d go over and we’d work out together. Most of the time, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd would meet up with us as well, and we’d go out for milkshakes or just hang out after the workout. That day, it was just the two of us until Todd opened the sliding glass door and walked out on the patio, followed by a familiar face. “Hey!” Davey called happily from where he stood spotting me on the bench press. While I put the bar back on its rest, he crossed over to meet Todd and hug him tightly. “We didn’t think you were coming!” “I had a guest come over.” Todd said and stood out of the way as I stood up and went to stand by them. “Davey, you might remember Sean from La Loma.” “Oh, yeah, hey Sean!” Davey said with a genuine smile as he held out his hand. Sean looked uncomfortable, but shook Davey’s hand. “I haven’t seen you since before we moved to Nevada. How ya doing?” “I’m okay.” Sean mumbled before looking at me with a look that wasn’t exactly pleasant. “Sean, do you know Brian?” Todd asked and Sean hung his head slightly. “Yeah.” He mumbled. “Hi Sean.” I said as cheerfully as I could. He looked so young. While he wasn’t as tall as I seemed to remember him being in the last timeline, he was still taller than he had been our freshman year. His face was paler though, far more freckled, and he had almost no muscle on him at all. In fact, he was as slender as a bean pole. “Hi.” Sean mumbled back. “I think I owe you an apology.” I said in as soft a voice as I could. Davey looked at me sharply while Todd nodded politely and Sean looked at me with bewilderment. “What do you mean?” Sean mumbled in confusion. “Back in Freshman year, you got stuffed in a trashcan at school.” I stated carefully, mostly because “I” had not been there, but the “me” of this timeline had been there. “I didn’t stop it from happening, and that was wrong. No one should be treated like that.” “Oh man, I’d forgotten about that.” Davey said sympathetically and he looked back at Sean. “Sean, I am so sorry I didn’t do anything to stop it either. Brian’s right, that was wrong of us.” “I deserved it.” Sean mumbled. “You don’t have to apologize to me.” “Bullshit.” Todd snorted. “No Sean, you’re wrong.” I said firmly. “No one deserves to be treated like that, and I hope that one day you might be able to forgive us for that. I just hope we can be friends from now on.” “You don’t want to be friends with me.” Sean mumbled and then he looked angrily at Todd. “You brought me here on purpose, didn’t you? You set me up.” “Hold on, Sean.” Davey said as the smaller guy started to walk away. Davey went up to him and put his hand on Sean’s shoulder. The guy flinched at that, but he stopped and turned around. “What?” Sean snapped angrily. “Why do you think you deserved what happened back then?” Davey asked him calmly and Sean’s shoulders slumped. “You’ll probably hear about it anyway.” Sean mumbled and then hung his head, probably trying to hide the tear that dripped down his cheek. “Dad already warned the pastor at the church and he told the youth pastor so by the time school starts everyone will know. I’m queer.” “So?” Davey asked in a voice that didn’t sound anything but confused. Sean had stiffened as he said the last part, and now he was staring at Davey in total confusion. “So, I’m a fag.” Sean snapped angrily. “I’m a fudgepacker. They’ve sent me to all sorts of quacks to make me straight but it doesn’t fucking work!” “Of course it doesn’t work.” Davey shrugged. “If you’re gay, you’re gay. Shame on those quacks taking your parents’ money for something they can’t change.” “Then again maybe his parents deserve to lose their money like that for trying to make him change.” I added and now Sean was staring at both of us with wide eyes while Todd practically split his face in two with his smile. “I… you… you’re all crazy!” Sean exclaimed. “I told you that you’d be better off back here in Modesto.” Todd said with an I-told-you-so expression on his face. “What are your friends going to say if they see you hanging around me?” Sean muttered. “You don’t even know me!” “We used to know you years ago, Sean.” I said in a gentle tone. “You were a good guy back then, and I’d be downright shocked if you weren’t still a good guy. If any of our friends have a problem with you, they have a problem with us and aren’t worth being our friends.” “Brian’s right.” Davey said firmly before looking back at me with a smile. “You think we’re done, Brian? I could use a milkshake. It’s getting hot. Then maybe we could come back and go for a swim.” “I don’t have any money for a milkshake.” Sean said. “It’s on me.” Davey said firmly. “I was your friend back in Freshman year and I totally dropped the ball on being a good friend back then. I’ve got a lot of making up to do for that.” “I don’t have a swimsuit.” Sean mumbled. “Then I’ll get you one on the way back.” I said firmly. “It’s the least I can do…” “You don’t have to do this.” Sean mumbled. “No, we don’t, but we want to do this.” I said firmly. He just shook his head, which Davey and I took as consent. When we got to the Snowy’s that made the best milkshakes in town, Sean had started to come out of his shell just a bit. I wasn’t surprised to see Brandon and Trevor there, and when they came over to join us, Sean started to go back into his shell a bit. Trevor didn’t remember him at all, but there was something in Brandon’s eyes that told me he remembered Sean. My two oldest friends joined us in heading back to Davey’s pool, even stopping at the sporting goods store to get Sean a set of swimming trunks. To my surprise, Brandon had whispered something to Trevor while we were walking into the store, and the two of them came up to Sean and apologized to him for the incident in Freshman year. Then they both pitched in for Sean’s swimsuit. “I can’t wear this!” Sean muttered as he looked at the dark green Speedo that Brandon was holding up for him. “Dude, it’d look good on you.” Brandon insisted and I caught the look in his eyes. So did Davey, who gave me a little smile while Sean continued to protest. “We all should get Speedos.” Todd suggested with a bright grin as he looked at Trevor. Oh yeah, I knew what the red head was thinking, wanting to see the school’s star quarterback in a Speedo. “Okay.” Davey said with a leer of his own. “No way.” Sean protested weakly, but his eyes almost bugged out as Davey held up a pair of white Speedos with red stripes on the hips. It was very difficult for me not to start drooling right then and there. Regular workouts had helped Davey shed those extra pounds and the thought of him in that was absolutely worthy of a bucket of drool. I was starting to laugh until Davey threw the white Speedos at me. “These are for you.” Davey said emphatically while pulling out another white Speedo, although this one had blue stripes. “These are for me.” “Cool.” I said while Brandon picked out a blue Speedo. We all paid for our Speedos, with Trevor having picked out a black pair and Todd a red pair that was going to clash madly with his hair. All of us pitched in for Sean’s over his continued protests. Then we set off for Davey’s house. “Let’s get changed!” Davey’s voice showed his excitement as we all rushed up to his room and started to change. Sean turned white and fled out of the room, down the hallway to the bathroom. “What’s his problem?” Brandon said in an offended tone. “He’s shy.” Todd said defensively with a warning look at Davey and me. “He’s not a jock like you guys.” “We’ll get him over that by the time summer’s out.” Brandon said confidently. When Sean reappeared with a towel wrapped around him, no one said anything. By the time we reached the pool, he was a lot calmer, and although he waited until he was next to the pool before taking off the towel and slipping into the water. At first he hung back while Davey and Brandon got into a splash war, but soon he was swimming around and playing like the rest of us. It was good to see that, as my conscience was screaming at me. Sean had been a good friend in the last timeline, and had sacrificed much over the years, as much as Davey had, if not more. He deserved to be happy now, even if he didn’t remember those times. Seeing the way Brandon reacted to him was another good thing as far as I was concerned. It was very obvious to me, and probably to Davey that Brandon was interested in Sean as more than a possible friend. Watching them dance around each other was going to be fun. The weeks that followed were as close to perfect as anything could be in life. Every day I was over at Davey’s house, and Sean was there almost constantly with Todd. Brandon was there quite a bit too, and while Trevor was still spending time with his newest girlfriend, he was there more days than not. Mom and Sandy were moving along with their Event Planning business as well. They had three clients already, and were deep in working with those people. Two of the clients were weddings, both referred by Sandy’s family members, and the third was actually a political fundraiser for a City Council candidate that my mother knew from one of the local charities she worked with. Sandy had even ‘hired’ Davey’s Aunt Bev to help with the planning and arrangements. The woman may have been confined to a wheelchair, but she was ecstatic with the work, and was over nearly every day, forcing her husband, or Davey’s father to get her ready and drive her to the house. On the phone she was a living terror to the different vendors they were using. Her quick wit, and ample vocabulary meant that anyone who didn’t perform up to her expectations got a tongue-lashing they would not soon forget. Whoever was over when she started in on someone over the phone would gather outside the office she used and listen. After she was done, she’d start in on us for giggling while she was on the phone. Like all good things, though, it eventually came to an end when Sean’s father paid a visit Davey’s mother while we were out on a day trip to Sonora. On the way back home, we’d dropped Sean off with Todd at Todd’s house, and Davey and I had gone back to his house. We’d planned on spending the night since Pete was coming by the next morning to take us fishing up in the mountains. “Davey, Brian, I need to talk to both of you now.” His mother said in a stern voice as we walked in the front door. It was obvious she was pissed about something, but we shrugged and put down the bags filled with the things we’d bought for our mothers, and Davey’s sister. She shut the door behind us as we entered the office that had been President Jones’s in another timeline. There were three desks in here, and while it was still wood-paneled, it had a much more feminine feel to it now. “What’s up, Mom?” Davey asked in a slightly nervous voice. Both Bev and my mother were in the room, and while they didn’t look happy, their looks were directed more at Sandy than at us, which made me even more confused as to what was wrong. “What do you know about that Sean boy?” She asked and everything suddenly made sense. It was with a sinking feeling in my stomach that I guessed what had happened. “We went to La Loma together, and Downey until we moved to Nevada.” Davey began after a quick look at me. “He’s a good guy.” “How do you know that?” His mother asked sharply. “Did he tell you why his family moved to Southern California? Did he tell you that he’s been seeing a therapist for years now?” “Mom, Jenny’s been seeing a therapist for years, and for that matter, we’ve been going with her!” Davey retorted hotly. “What does that have to do with Sean?” “We’ve been seeing a therapist to help your sister recover from what was done to her.” His mother shouted. “He’s seeing one because he’s the one who’s perverted! Has he tried to touch you?” “What do you mean ‘has he tried to touch me’?” Davey asked with a sharp edge to his voice and I almost winced. “We goof around all the time, but then again so does Brian and me.” “Don’t try to play coy with me!” His mom shouted while my mom turned a bright pink and tried to suppress a bark of laughter. I had a sinking feeling in my gut as Beverly looked over at her, then at Davey, and finally at me. Her direct gaze caused a slight blush to my cheeks while Sandy kept yelling at her son. “You know damn well what I mean! Has that boy tried to touch you sexually?” “Not that it’s any of your business if he had, but no, of course not.” Davey said with a snort and the room reverberated with the sound of her slapping him. “Don’t you dare talk to me like that!” His mother shouted. “His father came over and told me what a little pervert he is! You’ll have nothing to do with him any more, and I never want to see him over here again. People like him should be locked away from the rest of society…” “Sandy!” Bev shouted as my mother’s face began to grow red, not from the earlier humor but from real anger. “What is it?” Sandy snapped as Bev turned on her electric wheelchair and maneuvered herself to Sandy’s side while mother stood up. “What’s wrong with you?” Bev snapped as she hit Sandy in the side with her arm. Davey’s Aunt had been crippled from the neck down in an auto accident years ago, but she was still able to move her arms. Her hands she really couldn’t do much with, but she was deadly when she lashed out with her arms like that. “What’s that for?” Sandy growled, rubbing the spot where Bev had hit her. “How dare you talk about Sean that way!” Bev snapped. “He’s a good boy and you know that.” “I thought my husband was a good father and you see where that got me!” Sandy snapped back. “I’ll not have my son put in danger that way.” “Please tell me you don’t really feel that way.” Mom said sadly. Her anger was gone, replaced by a deep sense of sadness. “What does it matter if Sean’s gay?” “What?” Davey’s mother nearly squeaked with her surprise. “How can you say that Brenda? Homosexuals are perverts, one and all! It says so in the bible! What’s more, they’re all sick! Look at that AIDS thing! All homosexuals get AIDS and they die. If that Sean boy is a homosexual, he’ll have AIDS and I’m not going to risk my son being infected by him!” “Brian, get your things.” Mom said with a note of finality and I knew better than to argue with her right now. “What’s going on?” Sandy demanded imperiously. “I’m sorry, Sandy, but I cannot associate with someone who believes those things.” Mom said with a strong hint of sadness in her voice. “My brother Rich died of AIDS, and I will not listen to you insult his memory.” “You see!” Sandy said in a triumphant tone. “He probably got infected by homosexuals! That was his apartment, right? The one mom stayed at? He probably got it from them! Those homosexuals deserve every last bit of suffering God delivers to them.” “My Uncle Rich was the kindest, most caring person I’ve ever known.” I said through gritted teeth, remembering this woman caring for a young boy named Jeremy in another timeline. Suddenly I was homesick for that timeline, and I didn’t blame Sean one bit for not wanting to come back to this world. “I’m sure he was, but that’s what happens when you associate with homosexuals.” Sandy said. “I am ending our business relationship effective this moment.” Mom said through gritted teeth. “Why?” Sandy demanded with narrowed eyes. “Because Uncle Rich was gay, mother.” Davey said with a snort. “You can be so dense at times.” “I… um… look, I’m just overreacting.” Sandy began in an insincere apology. “Save it, Sandy.” Mom said angrily. “Right now I’m so angry nothing you can say will make a difference.” “But can’t you see that this is for the good of our boys?” Sandy asked in almost a whining tone. “We can’t have them perverted by that boy…” “Stop right there, Sandy.” Bev practically snarled, cutting off Davey’s mother who looked at her in shock. “Bev, you know that…” She started to protest. “I know that you’re not thinking, just reacting.” Bev snapped at her. “If you were thinking you’d have noticed something.” “What’s that?” Sandy snapped at her in frustration as she crossed her arms over her chest and glared at her sister-in-law sitting calmly in the wheelchair. “Doesn’t it strike you as odd that your son isn’t reacting in surprise at hearing that his friend is a homosexual, or that he knew that Brian’s uncle was one?” Bev asked and I cursed for not remembering how quick Davey’s aunt was. Sometimes I think he got the ability to think so quickly from her, instead of his mother or father. “What?” Sandy exclaimed in surprise while she turned to face her son who had gone slightly pale. “You knew about this and kept it from me?” “I… it wasn’t any of your business.” Davey said weakly and I had to flinch at the reaction on Sandy’s face. Part of me wanted to jump to his defense, but I knew this was his battle to fight, and I knew that I would not have been all too happy if either of our boys had spoken to me like that. “What do you mean it wasn’t my business?” She shouted and Davey did flinch in a major way this time. “How dare you say it isn’t my business? You’re my son and if something puts you in danger, it damn well is my business.” “I haven’t ever been in any danger, mother.” Davey said with sarcasm dripping from his voice. That did not bode well either. “Go to your room.” Sandy ordered. “I’ll deal with you later.” “No.” Davey said in firm, and flat, voice. “What do you mean no?” She demanded angrily. “You’re my son and as long as you live in my house you will do what I tell you!” “I’m seventeen, mother.” He said flatly in a voice that I knew foretold a lot of trouble. Unfortunately, his mother was so angry she probably didn’t recognize the tone. “If you want to go down this road, fine. I can leave.” “You leave this house and you’ll be cut off!” She shouted, growing flushed in the face. “Davey.” My mother said in a calm voice. Her face showed her worry. As she spoke the single word, she gathered the attention of everyone in the room. “What?” Davey asked in a harsh tone. It was obvious he was trying to not snap at her, which was a good thing. “I think everyone needs to take a deep breath.” My mother said in a slightly calm voice. “I thought you wanted nothing to do with me?” Sandy snapped waspishly at her. “I don’t, but your son and his relationship with you is a little more important than my anger at you for the moment.” My mother replied. “I don’t need your help to manage my son, Brenda.” Sandy sneered at her. “Don’t talk to her like that.” Davey snapped at her and she turned back to him and opened her mouth to deliver a tirade when Bev ran over her foot. “Ow!” Sandy shouted as she hopped around on her other foot, glaring at Bev who shrugged her shoulders. Davey had a tough time not bursting out in laughter, but he was hiding a big smile behind a hand. “I swear, Sandy, I get enough of this at home from my mother.” Bev said with an exasperated sigh as Sandy hopped around for another moment. She was glaring fiercely at Bev now, but her mouth was staying shut. “I’m sorry, Aunt Bev.” Davey said in a slightly meek tone. “You need to apologize to your mother.” Bev told Davey sharply. “For what?” His voice almost cracked and he looked stunned. “I thought you were on my side!” “I’m on no one’s side.” Bev retorted. “No matter what, she is your mother and deserves more respect than you’ve shown her tonight.” “You’re right.” Davey said after a long moment of thinking. He stood a little straighter and turned to face his mother. “I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you.” “What about what you said?” His mother retorted in a voice that sounded just as angry as before. “I’m not going to apologize for that.” Davey said firmly and she looked like she was about to go off on him again before Bev moved her wheelchair in a warning gesture. “We’re all intelligent people in this room.” Bev said softly and then she looked over at me with a penetrating stare. “Brian, you’ve been awful quiet. What do you have to say?” “I don’t know if anyone wants to hear my opinion right now.” I said with a shrug, trying to stay out of this mess. “I do.” Davey said softly. “I’d like to hear what he has to say.” My mother said just as softly and everyone turned to look at Sandy who stared at me for a long moment before also nodding. “If I was your parent and you spoke to me like that, I’d be pissed as hell.” I said to Davey and he looked hurt for a moment, before nodding slightly. Sandy looked triumphant until I turned to stare at her. “If I was your son, I’d be ashamed to be related to you.” “What?” Sandy gasped in surprise. “Have you given any thought to what Sean’s father hoped to accomplish by coming over here?” I asked her and her eyes widened in surprise. “Have you given a moment to think that there might be more to this story than you’re hearing from the man? If you had, you might have started this by asking some questions instead of assuming you knew everything you needed to know. If you’d done that you might have realized you were being played by that man.” “What do you mean?” Sandy asked with a hint of anger in her voice, but her eyes told me she was at least thinking. “Davey and I know a lot about Sean and what he’s been going through for the last couple of years.” I said softly. “Did you know that his father had him committed to a mental institution? Did you know that at that place they put electrodes on his penis and shocked him every time he showed any reaction to a picture of a man instead of a woman?” “That… that’s barbaric.” Sandy said with a shudder. “That’s what his father had done to him, and that was the nice stuff.” I continued mercilessly and she shook her head in disbelief. “He’s been kept isolated, he’s been forced to do so many disgusting things I don’t even want to think about them. That man hates his son and won’t rest until he’s made every minute of his son’s life miserable. In the last few weeks, Sean has actually had a few happy moments, most of them over here, and his father is trying to take that away from him.” “But… but the boy is a homosexual.” Davey’s mother protested. “Does that mean he deserves to be treated badly by his own parents?” Davey asked her and she looked at him for a second before turning back to me. “They realize that Sean’s old enough now that they don’t have long to control him.” I continued. “If he ran away again, and he’s done that a few times, they’d end up in trouble because Child Services down in Southern California investigated them. That’s one of the real reasons they moved back up here, so they wouldn’t be watched so much by the government for abusing their son.” “You’re kidding.” Sandy commented, but her voice showed she was believing me. “No, I’m not.” I stated. “Mom, Sean hates his parents now as much as they hate him.” Davey said in a much calmer voice. “The day he turns eighteen, he’s leaving their house. He doesn’t care if has to live on the street to get away from them, but the second he’s of legal age he’s walking out their door with nothing but the shirt on his back.” “And he’ll be better off for it despite having nothing.” I added and she looked horrified. “He’s just a boy, though.” Davey’s mother said. “It happens all the time, Sandy.” Brenda said softly. “Young men like him get thrown out of their homes, or leave because the situation is so unbearable, like it is for Sean, that they would prefer to be homeless than to live in that horror. Sean’s lucky, though. He’s got friends who are willing to stick up for him like Davey and Brian.” “But he’s a homosexual.” Sandy protested again, looking at her son. “I can’t have him putting you in danger.” “I’m in no more danger from him than Brian is from me.” Davey said and I had to do my best to not react to the implications of his words. Unfortunately, his mother caught them too, and the look on her face was filled with surprise, horror, and disbelief. Oh shit. Chapter 16 The silence in the room was deafening following Davey’s statement to his mother. The way she kept opening and closing her mouth made me think of a fish. My mother had gone pale, and Bev was staring at him with wide eyes. What surprised me the most was the calm look on Davey’s face. I had to wonder if he was going insane at that moment. “What are you saying?” Sandy asked Davey at long last. Her voice was weak, and I thought she might be on the verge of passing out. “If just being around Sean was a danger to me, then I must be a danger to Brian or anyone else I’m around, like Jenny for instance.” Davey said calmly and now I was growing more confused. What was the point he was trying to make? “Huh?” Bev asked in a voice that sounded every bit as confused as I felt. “What does Jenny have to do with this?” His mother asked sharply. Her temper was starting to flare up now. “Look at what Dad did to her.” Davey said softly. “I’ve been around Dad all my life. I idolized him, and he was molesting her all those years.” “That… that’s different.” Sandy said defensively. “That… what made your father do those things isn’t something you catch from just being around him.” “But Sean being gay is something I can catch?” Davey asked with a slight tilt of his head. “No, it’s not that.” His mother said defensively. “It’s the AIDS thing. You can catch that from him.” “Then I shouldn’t be around you either.” Davey countered and her face flushed with more anger. “Why do you say that?” She snapped. “You’re just as much at risk as Sean is, well more really.” Davey said to her and she looked stunned. “Sean isn’t having sex with guys, which is how he’d catch it. You had two blood transfusions during your surgeries. Look at that Ryan White kid. That’s how he got it, from a blood transfusion.” “I… how dare you?” She fumed, and she was starting to shake badly as she turned so she didn’t have to look at him. “Mom, I’m sorry.” Davey said softly and she turned back to look at him. “I know you don’t like to think about that, but it was a danger they told you about before the surgery. I know it worries you, but it’s there. If Sean being gay isn’t what puts me in danger from being around him, and you say it’s AIDS, you have to admit that your surgery makes you every bit as much a danger.” “It’s different.” She asserted. “How?” He asked her softly. “It just is.” She insisted, but she looked like she even knew the inanity of that argument. “I know that Sean being gay isn’t something you like, Sandy, but isn’t it his life?” My mother said in a gentle voice. “He’s Davey’s friend, Sandy.” Bev said softly. “I’ll admit, it doesn’t make me comfortable thinking about that… part of his life, but isn’t Davey the person who should decide if they stay friends or not? Davey’s almost an adult now, and he’s proven that he’s more than capable of acting like an adult.” “I wonder about that sometimes.” Sandy muttered as she looked at her son. “You don’t have to like him, Mother.” Davey said gently. “But he’s my friend and I’m not going to abandon him just because you don’t like him. If you don’t want him coming over here, fine. We’ll all go someplace else.” “That’s reasonable.” My mother said at once. “There’s no reason you boys can’t come over to the house, or go somewhere else. We don’t have a pool, but there are plenty of other things to do.” “I… I like having all of you come over here.” Sandy said defensively. “Either all my friends are welcome, or we can go someplace else.” Davey said firmly, but still in a gentle tone. “It’s not fair to any of them to be excluded like that.” “You’re really fine with Sean being a… homosexual?” Sandy asked my mother. “I loved my brother very much, Sandy.” My mother said gently. “Most of our family rejected him, but despite that he was still there for me when I needed help the most. No one else from my family lifted a finger to help me, but he did. I gave him a chance, and what I found was that he wasn’t really all that different because he preferred men. He still wanted to love someone, and to be loved. It’s not like what you see on television, at those parades you know. I mean sure, some are like that, but most gay people I’ve known in my life aren’t really like that. It’s just the news shows those people because they’re so…” “Outrageous.” I said when my mother faltered while looking for the right word. She nodded at me. “If he tries anything, you’ll tell me, right?” Davey’s mother asked him gently as her shoulders sagged in defeat. “Yes.” Davey promised and I sighed with relief of my own. For a moment, I had thought he had gone insane, but once again Davey had proved he could think better in tight situations than I could imagine. “Fine, why don’t you and Brian go do something?” She said with an air of defeat while she looked at my mother. “Brenda, I think the three of us should talk.” “Yes, we should.” My mother replied while Davey and I left their office. It struck me as odd that this was twice now, in two different timelines, that Sean’s father had caused an argument over his son to be fought out in this room. Davey sighed with relief as we headed up to his bedroom, not really saying anything until the door was shut and he was pulling me into a very tight hug. “Jesus that was close.” He mumbled against me while I put my arms around him even as his shoulders began to shake with gentle sobs. We stood like that for a while, he and I standing with our arms wrapped around each other while he cried into my shoulder. Finally he stopped crying and pulled back while I lowered my arms to my side. He wiped his eyes and gave me a small smile. “Thanks.” “Anything for you.” I said softly. “Do you mean that, Brian?” He asked me and I nodded my reassurance. “Good. I almost fucked up there big time.” “For a moment I thought you were going to tell your mother about us.” I said quietly and he chuckled softly while shaking his head. “That’s what I was going to do until I saw her face.” Davey stated. “When I saw her face I knew it’d be a mistake so I made up that other shit.” “That’s something I’ve always admired about you.” I told him. “You’re able to think so quickly on your feet like that. I’d have never been able to jump on that track about your father and her blood transfusion without having a lot of time to think about it first.” “Thanks.” Davey said as his smile slipped. “So you’ll understand what needs to happen now.” “What are you talking about?” I asked as a sliver of fear wormed its way to my gut. Where was his mind going now? “You and me, we can’t keep doing this, at least for now.” Davey said with a frown and I felt like I wanted to start shaking as my stomach dropped to my feet. “We can be friends, but nothing more. She can’t have any reason to suspect us.” “If you’re worried about her kicking you out…” I started to say but he shook his head. “That’s not it.” He said sadly. “I know your parents would give me a place with them. It’d kill my mother though, if she knew. I can’t have her looking at me like that, thinking those things about me. We’ll still be friends, though, and maybe after high school, when we’re in college we can pick up where we left off, but I can’t do this.” “You’re going to let your mother rule your life like this?” I asked him as my anger started to kick in and regretted it instantly. “You just said you’d do anything for me.” He shot back angrily. “Were they just words or did you mean them? I’m not kicking you out of my life, I’m just saying we need to keep it at the level of just being friends. What, you can’t stand the thought of not having sex?” “It’s not the sex I’m worried about, Davey.” I said sharply and he shook his head again. “Then what are you worried about?” He asked. “Davey, it’s wrong for you to put your life on hold for your mother and sister.” I argued. “That’s what you think.” He said with a hurt tone. “Look, you’re the one who said you always have to think things through. Well, go think about this. You’ll figure out I’m right. All we’re stopping is the sex, and the hugging and kissing stuff. We’re still going to be friends, right?” “Right.” I said with a heavy sigh. “I don’t like this Davey. What are you going to do next, date a girl?” “I might have to do that.” Davey said with a shrug. “Mom and Nanny are always asking me when I’m going to get a girlfriend. Nanny keeps pushing this Julie girl at me. Her mother is a volunteer at the hospital with Nanny. She goes to our school, so maybe I can date her and throw them off the track.” “She’s going to expect you to kiss her.” I warned him and he blushed. “It won’t mean anything, Brian.” He said with a heavy sigh. “It’s just maintaining my cover.” “I’m going to go.” I said abruptly as a feeling swept over me to get the hell out of there. The thought of Davey kissing anyone, whether he meant it or not, was too much for me to deal with right now. “Brian, please…” Davey’s voice trailed off with a hurt tone and I turned back to look at him. There were fresh tears in his eyes, but then there were new ones in mine too. “Don’t be mad. Just think about it.” “I will.” I said softly. “I’m not mad, though. I’m hurt, and I’m a little confused as to how you think this is best, but I’m not mad. I love you, Davey.” “I know.” He said softly, looking down at his feet as I shut his bedroom door behind me and made my way out of the house. It was a good thing that I didn’t run into anyone on the way out because by the time I got into my car, I was bawling like a little child. Several hours later my crying had turned into sniffling as I lay on my bed, clutching a pillow to my chest. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was going to lose Davey. No matter how similar this Davey was to the one I’d known and loved, even I had to admit they were very different people. My Davey had decades of experience this one didn’t have, and he’d told me the type of person he’d been at this age. How could I have been foolish enough to expect that this Davey would be faithful to me, would be willing to defy his family and risk their approval of him? “Brian, are you in there?” Mom’s voice from the other side of my door forced me to push back a few more sniffles, wipe my puffed-up eyes and focus back on the present. “I’m in here.” I said and was surprised at how much my voice shook. “Is everything alright, dear?” She asked in a worried tone and before I could say anything, she opened the door and took a very long look at me. “I thought something was up from the way you stormed out of there, and now I have a better idea of what’s going on.” “You do?” I asked in surprise. “What has Davey done now?” She asked with a sigh. “I swear, sometimes that kid can get as mixed up as his mother and grandmother. Does this have something to do with that Julie girl he’s supposed to be meeting for dinner tonight?” “Huh?” I mumbled in surprise as my heart dropped back down into my stomach again. Yep, that was Davey alright. Once he made a decision, he moved forward with it at full speed, and damn any of the consequences. “I was wondering why he was calling a girl to go out.” Mom said sadly. “Let me guess, he doesn’t want his mom to figure out about you two so he’s going to date this Julie girl. Do I have that about right?” “Yes.” I mumbled with a shake of my head. “Did you tell him how messed up that was and how much heartache it could cause?” She asked me. “No, not really.” I admitted softly. “I told him I don’t like it…” “Brian, for a guy who supposedly had experienced having grandchildren, you can spend a lot of time thinking like an ordinary teenager.” Mom said in an exasperated tone. “I’m not good at reacting to surprises.” I muttered miserably. He was already going out with Julie? A fresh batch of tears welled up in my eyes. “Oh my poor Brian.” Mom said sympathetically as those tears dribbled down my cheeks. She crossed the rooms and took me into her arms, where I cried hard enough to soak her blouse. I cried like that for a while, and when I slowed down, she started to dab my cheeks with a handkerchief. “Why don’t you go wash up while I start dinner. Don’t worry about Davey. We’ll all start working on talking some sense into him.” “Thank you, Mom.” I said, grateful once again to have my parents around. No matter how old I ever got, they were always a source of comfort and support for me. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep well that night, and the next day was a rough one for me. Trevor and Brandon showed up at my house, but they were surprised when I showed no interest in going over to Davey’s, or in doing anything else really. All I wanted to do was mope around for the day. They left after barely an hour, leaving me alone to work out on the weight machine that I had barely used in the last few months. We’d been using the sets at Davey’s. “What the hell is going on?” Todd’s voice interrupted me as he stormed onto the back patio just after noon. “What do you mean?” I asked him in a quiet voice. “I mean what’s up with you and Davey?” Todd spat back angrily. “He’s got some stupid girl named Julie over there making calf eyes at him and you’re nowhere around. His mom’s treating her like she’s the future daughter-in-law!” “Oh, Davey decided he’d rather pretend to be straight.” I muttered and Todd’s mouth hung open for a long time. For some reason that put a small smile on my face. “What are you smiling about?” Todd finally demanded. “You should be over there telling him he’s being an idiot!” “I was wondering if a fly really would fly into your mouth.” I chuckled and he shook his head. “Don’t change the subject.” He said sharply. “What are you going to do about that idiot? He’s already kissed her in front of everyone!” “He has?” I asked as my heart sank again. That was getting to be all too familiar a feeling. “Yes.” Todd said with disgust. “Then I guess he and I really are over.” I mumbled and Todd crossed his arms. “You’re only over if you let him do this stupid shit.” Todd said with determination and his foot was tapping on the cement. “Now I’ll ask it again, what are you going to do to stop his idiocy? He doesn’t belong with her, he belongs with you. Then again, if you’re available now, I think I might try pursuing you. You make a good boyfriend.” “I’m honored.” I said with a mocking bow of my head. “Sorry, Todd. You’re a good friend, but I’m not interested in you that way.” “Your loss.” Todd shrugged. “Do you want Davey back?” “Don’t be stupid, of course I do.” I growled. “He’s mine.” “Then you got to get him back.” Todd said as he started to pace. “Now, Davey’s as stubborn as his damn mother, so just talking to him won’t do any good. You’re going to have to make him jealous. I know! You can pick a girl and start dating her! Kiss her in front of him and let him see how it feels!” “I’m not going to lead some poor girl on that way.” I said with determination. “Well then, how about another guy?” He asked. “It’d have to be someone we already know, and you’ll have to do it carefully so no one outside our group knows. I see two choices, really. Me or Trevor.” “Why you or Trevor?” I asked with real curiosity. “Well, after they saw that there was a girl around, Brandon and Sean took off together.” Todd said with a sly grin. “I think they’re really hitting it off good.” “Good for them.” I said with genuine feeling. “I’m not sure about this jealousy thing though. It could really backfire.” “It won’t.” Todd said quickly. “You’d be willing to do this for me?” I asked him with a little surprise. “In a heartbeat.” Todd smiled. “Although if it was real, it’d be even better. You’re a good guy, Brian. But, if I can’t be your boyfriend I’ll take being your friend that helps you out whenever you need it.” “We don’t need to take it that far!” I said quickly as my cheeks blushed. “I know.” Todd teased me. “Davey doesn’t need to know that until later, though, right?” “No, no he doesn’t.” I agreed and Todd held out his hand. We shook then and he gave me a simpering glance. “So, should we practice kissing just to make it look real?” He asked with a hopeful tone. “Not just yet.” I said sternly. Now I had butterflies in my stomach. Part of me said this was stupid, that it could backfire so easily, but I also knew Davey and I didn’t want him sticking his dick in some girl just to secure his cover with his mother. It was three more days before I saw Davey again. After the second day where it was becoming evident Julie was a semi-permanent fixture, along with three of her girlfriends, everyone started meeting over at my house. >From there we’d go and do whatever we felt like that day, without Davey. The phone rang one morning, just after Mom had left for Sandy’s house and Dad had headed off to his work. I picked it up, and pretty much regretted it instantly when I heard Davey’s voice on the other line. Part of me wanted to hang up at his cheerful tone, but I didn’t. “What do you want?” I asked a little more harshly than I should have. “I… I want to see you.” Davey replied in a slightly weak voice. “I miss having you and the guys around. Did you tell them not to come over anymore?” “No.” I answered immediately. “Davey, they can’t be themselves with your… girlfriend and her friends around so they go where they’re more comfortable.” “So you didn’t tell them to stay away from me?” He asked plaintively. “No.” I replied. “I wouldn’t do something like that.” “Can we do something today?” He asked me in what was almost a whine. “I miss you already.” “What do you want to do?” I asked as the desire to see him overcame my anger for a moment. “We could go to the mall.” He said in a slightly happier tone. “Julie’s birthday is next weekend and I was thinking of getting her a necklace.” “Let me get this straight.” I said sharply as anger welled up inside of me. “You want to take the guy you dumped because your mother might guess we were a couple, and have him go with you to buy a necklace for some bimbo you’re seeing?” “Julie’s not a bimbo.” Davey said defensively. “No, I guess she’s not, but then neither am I.” I practically yelled into the phone before slamming it down. For several minutes I fumed, cussing out Davey and his idiotic thinking before deciding I really did need to do something. Trevor was doing something with his father today. Brandon was with his siblings and had Sean over, so that left Todd, whose crazy idea wasn’t sounding so bad just about now. “Hello?” Todd said as I called his number. “Hey, it’s Brian.” I said in a neutral tone. “Yo, dude, what’s up?” He asked in a happier tone. “I was wondering if you wanted to do something today.” I sort of asked him. “Uh, yeah, I was just sitting around.” He replied. “I’ve got the day off.” “Cool, how about I pick you up?” I asked. “About an hour?” “Fine by me.” He said happily and I hung up the phone. Almost exactly an hour later I was showered, shaved, and wearing a pair of khaki pants with one of my tightest blue t-shirts. “Where to?” He asked me as he got into the mustang. “How about the mall?” I asked with a perverse idea. Davey would probably be there, and even though I knew better, I wanted him to see me there with Todd. “Fine by me.” Todd said. “So, you hear from Davey lately?” “Yeah.” I said as my good mood evaporated. “Oh, how’d that go?” He asked. “He accused me of telling you guys to stay away from him.” I started off and Todd shook his head. “I told him you guys probably just weren’t comfortable with his girl and her friends there.” “That’s for sure.” Todd grumbled. “So, do you think Sean and Brandon are going to hook up?” “It’d be nice.” I answered. “You think they’ve actually done anything yet?” “They’ve fooled around.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Sean spent the next day praying on his knees for forgiveness, but as soon as Brandon called him he went right over. That boy is still mixed up in the head.” “Yeah, well, he has us to support him.” I stated. “Yup.” Todd agreed as he smiled at me again. “You think anymore about my idea?” “Yeah, I thought about it.” I said with a sigh. “And?” Todd asked with a tilt of his head. “Davey asked me to go to the mall with him to help him pick out a necklace for Julie.” I said sourly. “That stupid son of a bitch!” Todd exclaimed and then he started laughing. “We’re going to the mall, right?” “Yup.” I answered with a knowing grin. “You can be an evil man, Brian.” Todd smirked as he reached across the seat to rub my leg. “Todd, don’t take it too far.” I warned him with a little growl. “I know, I know.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Just remember, if Davey never fucking wakes up and smells the coffee, you’ve got lots of options.” “I know, and I appreciate that, Todd.” I said with a sideways glance at him. “I like you. You’re a good guy, but I don’t feel that way about you. Maybe we shouldn’t do this. You’ll only end up getting hurt.” “No, I won’t.” Todd said with a slightly pained expression. “Yeah, it’ll suck if it works and you two get back together, but for a little while at least I can pretend, and maybe I’ll have an idea about what it’ll be like when I do meet someone as nice as you.” “Fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” I said a little fiercely and he smiled as we pulled into the parking lot of the mall. Vintage Fair mall hadn’t been remodeled since it was built in the 1970’s, and still reflected some of the psychedelic décor of that time period. It’d be another fifteen years before it was remodeled and would get stores like Abercrombie & Fitch, or Hollister. Many of the same jewelry stores were there, and I couldn’t help but stop and point out a nice gold chain meant for a man to Todd. “I like that one.” He said to me just as Davey walked up to us. I’d noticed him on the other side of the mall and he’d been watching us as we went up to the jewelry store. “Is this why you wouldn’t come with me?” Davey snarled without any preamble and I turned to see him with a face reddened by his anger. “You decided to get yourself a new boy-toy and you’re going to buy him something now?” “What does it matter to you if he is?” Todd snarled back. “You’re the one who broke things off with him so you could pretend with that Julie girl.” “Don’t get in the middle of this.” Davey snarled at him while I looked around to see if anyone was close enough to hear us. “Davey, you might want to be careful or someone will hear us.” I said calmly. “You know what, fuck you Brian Breckenridge.” Davey snarled. “Not anymore.” I growled back at him and he stepped back while his eyes widened and Todd chuckled. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, Davey, you know exactly what I mean.” I told him. “It didn’t take you long to go from just using her as a cover to kissing her all over the place. Sean told me how she had her hand down your bathing suit the other day.” “I didn’t want her to do that!” Davey snarled defensively. “I told her to take it out as soon as it happened!” “No you didn’t.” Todd sneered. “You waited at least a minute until you noticed other people were seeing it happen.” “We used to do that stuff all the time and no one ever thought it was a big deal.” Davey said defensively. “You’re right, you can do it all you want.” I snarled at him, finally letting the anger I was feeling really vent out. “Just don’t expect me to sit around and wait for you to get bored.” “I thought you said you’d always love me.” He almost whined. “I will always love you, Davey.” I answered honestly, meeting his hurt gaze with a hurt gaze of my own. “What you have to understand is that I don’t have to live my life with you even though I love you. Sure, I wanted to live my life with you, but, you know, I don’t know if you’re worth it.” “What?” Davey nearly shrieked. “You come back in time for me and don’t think I’m worth it anymore?” “Huh?” Todd said in confusion and I stared at Davey as realization dawned on his face. “It’s a private joke.” Davey temporized quickly and Todd shook his head in confusion. “Brian told me one time he’d even come back in time for me if he had to.” “You guys can have some weird conversations, or at least you used to have them.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Shut up, dirtbag.” Davey told him sharply. “You couldn’t even wait a week before trying to sink your claws in Brian.” “Why not, you took less time than that to dump him for some cunt.” Todd sneered and Davey lashed out with a fist, catching Todd in the stomach and doubling him over. “That’s not what I did.” Davey said fiercely, but his eyes were pleading with me. “I have to do this. You understand, don’t you, Brian?” “I understand why you want to, but I don’t understand why you are stupid enough to think it’s the right thing to do.” I countered him while reaching out to support Todd who was clutching his gut. “I also don’t understand why you think it’s okay to hit Todd. I thought you were better than that.” “Maybe I’m just a stupid kid without decades and decades of growing up.” Davey sneered and I gave him a narrowed-eye look before shaking my head. “C’mon Todd, let’s get you out of here.” I said sadly as I walked away, supporting Todd and not even looking back at Davey Jones. Chapter 17 I was lying on the ground with a sharp pain in my midsection. My ears were ringing from the force my head had hit the grass with, despite the helmet, and it was hard to even breath at the moment. It was the last practice before our Championship game, and we were only wearing shoulder pads and helmets instead of full gear, and we most definitely were not supposed to be hitting each other this hard. “Jones, what the fuck is wrong with you?” Coach Cole snarled as he reached me and knelt down. Davey stood over me, probably glaring daggers at me like he’d done every time we’d seen each other for the last few months. Part of me had hoped he’d not play after all, and another part wanted to quit the team, but he was there and I wouldn’t quit just because of him. “Sorry coach.” Davey said around his mouth guard before turning and walking away. “You okay, Breckenridge?” Coach asked as he helped me sit up. “Just got the breath knocked out of me.” I said weakly. “What is it between you two?” Cole asked me with real concern. “Last semester you two couldn’t be pried apart with a crowbar.” “Yeah, well, things change.” I said as I got to my feet. Coach had to support me as I limped to the sidelines and Brandon went in to take my place. Two hours later I was pulling into the driveway of Davey’s house. I hadn’t been there since that day he’d ended our relationship to keep his mother from figuring out he was gay. If I had any choice, I wouldn’t be here now. “Yes?” The Housekeeper, a middle-aged Mexican woman asked when I rang the doorbell. “I’m Brian, Brenda’s son.” I said holding the box Mom had asked me to pick up at the airport. “Oh yes, come in.” The woman said with a slight smile. “She’s in the office. I’ll show you the way.” “I know it.” I said grimly. It felt weird being in here, like I was an interloper. At least Davey wasn’t here. Neither was my mother, I discovered as I entered the room that had once been President Jones’s study. Davey’s mother was in there alone, doing some paperwork. “Brian!” She exclaimed with a smile as I entered. “Good, you got it. Why don’t you put it over there on the table?” “Sure, Mrs. Jones.” I said softly as she pointed to a side table. I put the box down, wiping my hands on my jeans and turned, preparing to leave. “How have you been, Brian?” She asked me before I could escape. “I’ve been well, ma’am.” I said simply, hoping she’d let it go at that. “I haven’t seen you in ages.” She said and I realized I was in for the full questioning. “I’ve been busy.” I said softly. “That’s what Davey’s said.” She stated with a frown. “He’s been miserable, you know. He won’t tell me what caused you boys to fight.” “It’s a guy thing.” I said quickly and she frowned. “I haven’t seen that Sean boy around here much, either.” She said. “Did that have something to do with it? I thought it was agreed it would be okay if he came over as long as he didn’t… do anything.” “He isn’t comfortable over here.” I said, hoping this was a way to get her to let me go. “I think he knows he’s not really wanted over here and he’s nice enough to not push himself where he’s not wanted.” “I see.” She said with a deeper frown. “You know that had nothing to do with you, right? I’d hate to think that Davey’s best friend abandoned him because of something his mother said.” “I…uh…” I stammered, not able to find anything to say that wasn’t a lie or too close to the truth. “You know that Davey does miss you, don’t you?” She asked. “I mean, he’s been doing poorly in school without someone to study with, and all those girls he’s been dating haven’t done much to help him concentrate on his books. I’m starting to worry he might not be able to get into a good school if he keeps this up.” “With all due respect, that’s his problem.” I said a little more forcefully than I should have. Davey had dumped Julie two weeks into the school year, and was now dating Heather, one of the cheerleaders running for Homecoming Queen. Davey was rumored to be the favorite for King this year. “Why are you so angry with him, then?” She asked directly. “After everything he went through where you supported him, I can’t understand why you would turn your back on him when he’s finally getting his life put together.” “Maybe because I disagree with how he’s going about doing that.” I said with a shrug. It was time this conversation ended. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some more errands to run. It was nice seeing you again.” “Don’t be such a stranger, Brian.” She murmured as I left the room. Unfortunately I didn’t make it out of the house in time, because Davey was walking in with Riley from the football team, and both Heather and Riley’s girlfriend, Marsha were following behind. “Oh, hi.” Davey said as he saw me in the entranceway. “I was just leaving.” I said shortly and moved to push my way through them, garnering a glare from Riley and a look of confusion between the two girls. “What is it with him?” I heard Heather ask from behind. “Brian, wait!” Davey called out before I’d gone three steps to my car. He said something under his breath to the others and shut the door behind him as he caught up with me. “I’m sorry about the hit today. It was wrong of me.” “Apology accepted.” I said simply, not looking at him. “Is that all you have to say?” He asked in a hurt tone. “What else is there to say?” I asked him. “You made it quite clear already. You don’t want to risk your mom knowing about what used to be between us, I don’t want to live a lie, watching you make out with some girl all the time.” “It doesn’t have to be this way.” Davey said in a hurt voice. “I miss you.” “You’re right, it doesn’t have to be this way.” I said turning around to look at him. He looked shocked by the anger in my eyes. “You chose your path, I chose mine.” “Are you and Todd really going out or is it just to make me jealous?” He asked. “We’re planning on going to Arizona State together.” I said with a shrug. “Why?” He asked with a frown. “You remember my plan for the future?” I asked him and he nodded. “Well after the incident at the mall, I decided I could trust him and I told him everything. He’s going to help me, and that’s why we’re going to Arizona State. It’s part of the plan.” “I was going to help you…” Davey’s voice drifted off and his hurt look deepened. “You know, this is just until after high school, or maybe after college, once I don’t need Mom’s support anymore. We can get back together then.” “Have you fucked any of those girls yet?” I asked him pointedly and he blanched. “Have you fucked Todd yet?” He demanded of me. “No, we’re good friends, not lovers.” I replied. “Todd wants more, and who knows, maybe after you’re out of my life once and for all, I might like him that way, but for now, no.” “I haven’t had sex with any of the girls.” Davey said softly and there were tears in his eyes. “That’s why I keep breaking up with them. They want to go further than I’m willing.” “Just how far are you willing to go with them?” I snapped, not really wanting to know the answer. “Julie’s the only one to get so far as her hands down my pants.” Davey said defiantly, as if daring me to disbelieve him. “Why not?” I asked him. “Do you really have to ask that?” His voice quaked slightly. “Yes.” I answered. “Because I’m still in love with you and I don’t want anyone but you!” He nearly shouted, and then looked horrified at how loud he’d reacted. With fear, he looked around and only relaxed slightly when he realized no one was around. When he turned back to me, he looked slightly ashamed, but also determined to say something. “Why? Brian, why did you react like this?” “If you love someone you don’t dictate to them.” I said softly. “When you decided this was what you wanted, you were dictating to me the terms of our relationship. I’m not stupid enough to let you turn our relationship into a one-way street.” “I didn’t… that’s not what I wanted to do!” He protested. “It’s what you did.” I replied. “If you wanted to make it a one-way street, well two can play that game, Davey. I love you, I love you a lot, but that love does not give you the right to treat me like a doormat.” “You still love me?” He asked with a look of hope. “I will love you until the day I die, and probably even beyond that if there’s a way.” I said to him with all my heart. “But you’re still not going to take me back?” He asked. “Not like this, no.” I said. “I’m sorry Davey, I’d be willing to come up with something to work around your fears with your parents, but I won’t be dictated to, and that’s what you wanted.” “So, if I said it differently we could still work things out?” He asked hopefully. “Not at this point.” I said with a sad shake of my head. “Maybe back when this all began. No, don’t say anything. I made a couple of mistakes too, like that trip to the mall. It takes two to tango, and we were both ready to dance. But, now we’ve made our beds, separately, and we’ll have to live with them.” “I don’t want a life without you.” He said miserably. “But you put your mother and family as being more important.” I said simply. “I understand that, Davey, I really do. They mean more to you than anything else, including your own life. That’s fine, really, if you want to live your life as a slave to their expectations, their goals, and their desires, that’s your prerogative. Just don’t expect me to go along for the ride.” “I…” He started to say before he fell silent. “Goodbye, Davey.” I said before turning and heading back to my car. It had a feeling of finality to it, and my eyes were clouded with tears by the time I pulled out of the driveway and headed home. When I saw Todd’s car already there waiting for me, it was actually a relief, and he followed me inside the empty house without bothering to say a word. He’d seen the look on my face, and knew I’d spend the next thirty minutes with his arms wrapped around me while I soaked his shirt with more tears. It had happened often enough, and we didn’t even bother going further in the house than the entryway before I bent over and cried into his shoulder. He was a lot shorter than me, which meant that by the time I was done, my neck and back was sore, but I was grateful. When his lips locked on mine as I tried to straighten up, I was caught totally by surprise. Sure, I knew he still carried a torch for me, but he’d never tried this before. Still, there was something in that touch, that kiss that lit a fire inside me. I had been without this since Davey and I had… broken up, and it felt good as we kissed. Not nearly as good as Davey, but still… “No.” I said as I finally broke away from the kiss. “No, what?” Davey’s harsh voice surprised me and I turned to see him standing inside the doorway, a look of anger and pain on his face. “Oh shit.” Todd said softly, moving out of my embrace even as I stepped back as well. “So, I thought you said the two of you weren’t more than friends.” Davey snarled at me as anger totally replaced the look of hurt. “It’s nice to know I can be as stupid as my mother when it comes to believing the men I love.” “Davey, it’s not like that.” Todd said before I could even think of a single thing to say. “I kissed him. It was the first time!” “How was it?” Davey snarled his question at me as he clenched and unclenched his fists. “Not the same.” I said with a sad look at him. “I’m sorry Todd, but I don’t love you.” “It was worth a try.” Todd said with a shrug. “But then, I didn’t expect to get caught by him.” “Of course you didn’t.” Davey sneered. “Why should I come over here anymore? Tell me Todd, how much of this has been your idea?” “Davey, stop that.” I said sharply. “We’ve got enough problems between us that you don’t need to make new ones.” “Yeah, well I was coming over to see if that offer of always having a place to stay here still stood, but I don’t know now.” Davey snarled again. “I don’t know if I can stand to see all of our friends trying to get down your pants.” “Like you expected me to stand around and watch all those girls do the same to you?” I snapped back at him before the import of his words hit me. “What do you mean if you could stay here?” “Mom’s kicked me out.” Davey snapped with a look of hurt. “Why would she do that?” Todd asked with a perplexed look. “Because I’m a fucking pervert as bad as my father.” Davey snarled angrily, but there were tears in his eyes. “What happened?” I asked with real concern as my anger washed away in the blink of an eye. I took a step towards him, and he responded by stepping towards me before he fell into my arms, crying on my shoulders. It was a long time before he could make any sounds that were intelligible. Todd helped me guide Davey towards a couch, and got a box of tissues for Davey to blow his nose once he calmed down. “She confronted me after you left.” Davey said softly as he clutched my hand. We were now sitting side-by-side with Todd in a chair across from us. “About what?” “About you, about me, about what I did to keep you away.” Davey said sadly. His shoulders shook a bit more, and his voice was quivering. “She kept harping on me in front of Riley and Heather and Jennifer. I snapped. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told her, right there in front of everyone.”",

I was surprised though when he got a pensive look on his face. “Brian, can I ask you something?” “Sure.” I said casually, but there was a sudden tightening in my gut. That look on his face meant he was thinking of something unpleasant. “You’re from a future, but you say the future isn’t set in stone.” Davey said slowly as though he was thinking aloud more than anything. “Some things will be the same, but other things will be different, right? That’s how… that is how you can plan to make some changes, to make the world a better place.” “That’s right.” I said softly. “But you can’t guarantee it will work.” Davey continued his thought process aloud. “You mentioned how one of the other timelines the other me created, it ended in nuclear war, which was when they created the timeline you came from.” “You got it correct.” I confirmed for him. “The same thing could happen here, if we’re not careful, although it’s pretty late in the timeline for something like that. It was other time travelers that really precipitated that war, and their attempt to control the secrets of time travel. That secret’s dead now. I don’t know nearly enough to make another machine. In a couple of years, the Soviet Union will cease to exist, and while there’s still threats of a city being blown up, or minor stuff like that, it’ll be decades before China gets close enough to having the technology to instigate a war that could threaten the entire planet.” “Yeah, but doesn’t that mean that you can’t absolutely predict certain things?” Davey asked slowly. “You can’t tell me my mom will live to be an old woman, or that my sister won’t die in a car accident, or even that you or I won’t die in an accident.” “Life would be kind of boring if we knew everything that was going to happen, wouldn’t it?” I asked him and he chuckled softly. “Uh huh, but really, Brian, what makes us any better suited to changing the world?” Davey asked me in a quiet voice. “Anything can happen, right? How do we know we’ll be happy, and that we’ll do what we set out to do?” “Right now the Governor of Arkansas is biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to go after his lifelong dream of becoming President.” I said in a firm, but quiet voice. “He’s going to win in 1992, ending twelve years of Republican rule from the White House. There’s many things he will want to do in office and while he’s President, this country – and the world will change from the Cold War era into a new era. He’ll succeed at a lot of things while in office, and fail at others, but in the end his most memorable feat in office will be that he was impeached because he lied about getting a blow job from an intern.” “You’re kidding!” Davey’s voice cracked and his eyes were wide. “Nope.” I said smugly. “Well, that’s what he’ll be remembered for if he doesn’t get some good advice and follow it while he’s President. Still, the guy’s been dreaming since he met John F. Kennedy that he would one day be President, and he’ll succeed, but he’ll be remembered for being impeached over a lie, more than anything else.” “What does that have to do with…” Davey’s voice drifted off while I smiled. “It means I don’t know if we’ll succeed, but I know we should try, and I know that we should be careful not to get tripped up by stupid things along the way.” I answered. “I also believe that if Bill Clinton didn’t run in 1992, we might have been worse off than we were with him in office. The bottom line is that we have to try, and no, we’re not guaranteed to win, but if we don’t try, there will be no chance that things are better. I can’t promise you anything, except that I’ll always love you, and I’ll always be there for you.” “Unless you die in a car accident.” Davey pointed out and I had to nod. “Well, I’ll just have to make sure that if you are in an accident, I’m there with you so I won’t have to see what happens without you around.” “I…” I lost my voice at that and he smiled before stepping closer to me and kissing me on the lips. “We better go see what Mom’s up to.” He said with an impish grin before walking out. I followed him, thoroughly confused about the whole point of all this talking, but decided to just stop worrying and see what was in store for me. “This will make a great office for the both of us.” Davey’s mother was saying to my mother as we found them standing in front of the room that I had always thought of as President Jones’s private office. For some reason her words sent a pang of regret through me. I still had not met the man in this timeline, and part of me didn’t want to meet him. “If you think so, Sandy.” Mom answered with a grin. “This house is wonderful, and it is so close to ours.” “Good, then it’ll be easy for us to get together here.” Mom said as Pete came around the corner with the realtor trailing behind him. “You sure you want this place?” Pete asked Sandy who nodded. I knew it was an act on Pete’s part as he sighed before turning to the realtor. “If she’s so set on the place, I guess we’ll take it, but we’re not paying a dime over four-twenty.” “I’ll have to talk to the seller, but I think he’ll agree.” The realtor said with a slightly oily smile. That was a good thirty thousand less than the asking price, so Pete must have done some good bargaining, but it looked like the deal was made. “We’d better get heading back.” Pete said. “Mom should be home with the baby by now.” “Let’s go.” Sandy said before calling out for her daughter. Sandy and Mom took Sandy’s RX-7, while I got to drive Davey and the girls back and Pete took his own van back to Ceres. “Can we stop at Foster’s Freeze on the way?” Jenny asked petulantly as we neared Ceres. Her and her friends had done nothing but chatter away the entire time, while Davey and I had pretty much remained silent. “Sure.” I said with a sigh. She was always wanting something extra, no matter what we did, and as I expected, it was Davey who paid for the slushies at the Foster’s Freeze. We got back to Pete and Monta’s house just in time to see a strange man get out of his car, wearing a suit, and walk up to Sandy, who was standing in the driveway talking to Pete and my mother. “Who’s that?” Jenny asked as I parked and we got out of the car just in time to hear Sandy start shouting at the man, who walked away quickly, holding a clipboard and shaking his head. Davey rushed forward to his mother’s side. “What’s wrong?” He asked her. “Your good-for-nothing father!” Pete snapped while Sandy held out a packet of papers to Davey. “The bastard is suing me!” Sandy snarled angrily. “What?” Jenny half-screeched. “Why?” Davey asked as he took the papers and started riffling through them. I looked over his shoulder and read that Sandy was being sued by her estranged husband for half of the lottery money. “Just because I haven’t gotten around to divorcing him yet he’s saying he deserves half of my money!” Sandy half-yelled, but she was near hysterical as my mother put a comforting arm around her. She turned and started crying into Mom’s shoulder. “He can’t do this.” Davey snarled angrily as he shoved the papers at his grandfather who was giving him a stern gaze. “Davey, don’t do…” Pete started to say, but Davey wasn’t listening. Instead, Davey was storming away, half-running down the street. With a glance at Mom I started after him. “Davey…” I called out when I got close to him, halfway to his other grandmother’s house. She lived right around the corner, and it was a very short distance. “Don’t try to stop me.” Davey fumed without slowing down as I pulled abreast of him. “I’m not going to do that.” I said firmly. “Still, let’s walk, okay?” “Why?” He asked. “So you have a few extra minutes to think about what you’re going to say instead of just spouting off at him.” I answered. He stopped suddenly and gave me a long look. “You’re not going to try to stop me?” He asked. “No.” I answered simply. “I’ve got your back. This is wrong of him to try to do this.” “Oh.” Davey said softly and then cocked his head as he looked at me. “What do you think I should say?” “I don’t know.” I shrugged. “The man I knew would never do something like this, so you know him better than me. Plus, I always like to think things through before I do something. You’re the one who things on his feet really well, as long as you take a few minutes to run things through your head first. Me, I’d take a day or two to get something half as decent as what you can put together in a few minutes.” “Okay.” Davey said with a curt nod of his head. “He’s doing this because… well because money has always been tight for grandma. He’s living there with her, Aunt Bev, Ron, and Bryan, and he’s having to work at McDonald’s, which I know he hates. He thinks it’s beneath him. Mom’s got this huge pile of money, and if she shared it with him, he’d not have to do that.” “Do you think he’s even talked to her?” I asked Davey and he nodded. “She told him no way in hell was he touching any of her money.” Davey answered. “What can you do?” I asked him and he took a deep breath. “He loves me.” Davey said softly. “Dad hates the fact that we don’t get along like we used to, and that I hardly ever go visit him.” “That’s not your fault.” I affirmed and he shook his head. “That still doesn’t change the fact that he misses that.” Davey said. “Okay, I think I know what I’m going to say.” “Good.” I said as he started walking, but he stopped again and turned to look at me with a little smile on his face. “Thanks.” He said quietly. “You’re welcome.” I replied with a return smile. “It’s… I know we don’t talk about… about being in a relationship a lot, mostly because it makes you uncomfortable, but this is what I want. I want us to be able to depend on each other for advice, and to help each other out.” “I… I think I could get use to this.” Davey said with a husky voice and he squeezed my arm once before turning to walk towards his grandmother’s. “You coming?” “I’m right behind you.” I said affectionately and he chuckled. Soon enough we were walking up the driveway to his grandmother’s. Her old white and brown Chrysler was parked on the right of the driveway, while an ugly brown van was parked on the left and a boat was in the grassy area next to the left side of the driveway. The little red 1979 Toyota pickup that Davey’s father had bought years ago from Pete was parked on the side of the road in front of the house. It seemed everyone was home. “Davey!” Davey’s paternal grandmother nearly shouted when she answered his knock on the door. “What a surprise! Oh look at you!” “Hi Grandma.” Davey said as the woman pulled him into a tight hug. She was shorter than him, and looked a lot younger than the last time I’d seen her in 2007. “Is Dad home?” “DAVID!” She shouted before releasing Davey. “Oh Davey! We haven’t seen you in weeks! What have you been up to? Who is this?” “Grandma, this is my friend Brian.” Davey said politely. “Brian, this is my grandma.” “It’s nice to meet a friend of Davey’s.” She said excitedly to me. “You boys come on inside and let me fix you something to eat!” “I’m just here to talk to my father.” Davey said firmly, letting his anger show a bit and she frowned immediately. “It’s about your mother, isn’t it?” She said sourly. “She got her papers today. Well, if that’s what it takes to bring you over here, I say your father should sue her every damn day! I swear, that woman! First she ruins our family, airing our dirty laundry for everyone to see and then she goes and wins the lottery and refuses to share the money like a good wife should! If I had that bitch in front of me right now I’d…” “Stop it.” Davey growled and she frowned at him. “Well, if that’s the way you’re going to talk to me, your grandmother, I don’t want you coming inside this house!” She snarled and stepped back as the sound of footsteps could be heard coming down the hallway. Davey’s father appeared behind her, his hair still wet from the shower he must have been taking when we showed up. “Davey!” He said with excitement and a broad grin while I took in the differences between this man and the one I remembered from another time. This David Jones Sr. was overweight, and had a bushy mustache that he’d never worn in the time I’d known him in that other timeline. “I need to talk to you.” Davey said firmly, ignoring his grandmother’s noises of distaste and staring at his father. His entire body was tense. “Who is this?” His father asked, nodding in my direction. “This is my best friend, Brian.” Davey answered. “Can we talk out here?” “Uh, sure.” His father said as Davey and I took a few steps back and down so we were off of the front porch. As he stepped outside he turned to his mother. “I’ll be just a few minutes, mother.” “You put him in his place, David!” She snarled before slamming the door behind him. He shook his head and turned to look at Davey. “I take it your mother was served?” He asked and Davey nodded. “You want to talk about this in front of him?” “He and his parents bought Mom the winning lottery ticket as a gift.” Davey said through gritted teeth as he stared his father down. “His family let us use their apartment in the city when Mom was going through her surgery. I’ve stayed at his place for the last few months, and his mother his going into business with Mom. As far as I’m concerned he’s a part of my family.” “I see.” David Jones Sr. said as he gave me an appraising look. “I appreciate everything your family has done for my son and my wife.” “She’s only your wife because she hasn’t gotten the nerve up yet to actually file for divorce.” Davey snarled. “Maybe now you’ve finally pushed her far enough she’ll file the damn paperwork.” “Watch your language young man!” Davey’s father snapped at him. “You’re still my son!” “You may have sired me, but you’ve long since given up any right to be a part of my family.” Davey shot back angrily. “Only because your mother refused to…” David Jones started to say, but Davey cut him off. “She refused to forget what you did to Jenny, how you did what no father should ever to do to his daughter, and she refuses to live a lie just so you can save face.” Davey shot back. “We were married before God, and you can’t just turn your back on that when things don’t go right.” His father retorted. “This is a little beyond ‘irreconcilable differences.” Davey snorted. “You don’t deserve her.” “How dare you say that?” Davey’s father nearly shouted as his face turned purple. “I don’t know how you think you can talk to an adult, much less your father that way but I won’t stand for it!” “I can talk to you this way because you’ve long since lost any right to deal with me as a parent to his child.” Davey’s voice dropped an octave and his hands balled up into a fist. “When you touched my sister the way you did, you gave up any and all rights to deal with me as a parent. The most you can ever hope for is that one day I’ll be ready to forgive you and we might develop a relationship as adults. When you did what you did to Jenny, you did more than just molest her. You destroyed our family. You forced Mom to make decisions no wife or mother should ever have to make, and you forced me to assume the responsibilities of an adult. Or have you forgotten that it has been me, not you, whose been paying the bills for Jenny’s psychotherapist?” “I haven’t… you can’t blame me that no one will hire me after it was in all the papers…” His father said weakly. “Now you try to take what Mom has luckily been given thanks to Brian and his parents?” Davey continued in that low, vicious tone. “Is that how you plan to prove to me that you’re worthy of being a part of my life?” “What?” David Jones Sr. asked with real confusion in his eyes. “You do want to earn my approval, my respect, and maybe have some reconciliation with me and Jenny, don’t you?” Davey asked calmly. “Of course I do…” His father replied, but stopped as Davey stared at him silently. “Is this the best way to do it?” Davey asked him and the older man stared at his son for a long time. “When did you get so wise?” David Jones asked his son. “I did listen, you know.” His son stated in a voice that was void of the anger that had been there earlier. It was still quiet, but there was a softness to it that had not been evident until now. The older man’s head jerked up a bit and he gave his son a quizzical look. “When you were preaching. I listened. When I was younger, I remember you preaching about Jesus and how he acted when the Roman soldiers came to arrest him. Remember in Waterford when Sampson was beating me up? I could have fought back anytime, I could have pummeled him, but I didn’t because I remembered you teaching how violence was not the answer according to Jesus.” “You did fight him eventually, and you won.” David Sr. said with a slight smile while I stared in surprise at Davey. I’d never heard this story before. “You and he were the best of friends for a long time, until we moved back to Modesto.” “Yes, but I didn’t fight him until he hit April.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. “He’s in Modesto now.” David Sr. said calmly. “I saw him the other day. His parents moved to Modesto last year.” “Oh.” Davey said softly before shaking his head. “My point, Dad, is that I did listen to your sermons. There was a lot of good in them, and I’m a better person for having listened to them. When… when we came back and I was old enough to work, I got a job so we could afford Jenny’s sessions. No, don’t look like that. This is not an attack on you for not being able to pay for it. I do understand why you couldn’t, but because of what I learned from your sermons I didn’t hesitate to do the right thing when it was needed.” “I… I can’t say how proud of you I am for that.” His father said in a quiet tone and Davey cocked his head to the side while looking at his father. “Then why don’t you practice what you use to preach?” He asked his father and the older man flinched before frowning. “I… I… you don’t understand.” David Sr. replied softly. “Your grandmother’s had to take a second mortgage out on the house because of the legal bills, and Bev’s medical bills. Your Aunt was in the hospital for a few weeks there, you know.” “No, I didn’t, and I should have.” Davey said softly. “She’d like to see you.” David Sr. said softly. “Maybe I will, before I leave.” Davey said quietly. “Still, does any of that justify you doing this to Mom?” “I… no, it doesn’t.” David Sr. said softly. “It’s just… you know how your grandmother can be.” “Yes, but that doesn’t justify you giving in to her.” Davey said firmly. “I have to live here, damn it!” His father snapped and Davey did look sympathetic for a moment. “I’d be ready to kill her if I had to live here for more than a few months.” Davey snorted and his father chuckled softly. “Look, Dad, I didn’t know about the mortgage and all that. Maybe I can talk Mom into helping with that. She loves Bev still, you know.” “I know.” Dad sighed. “Sometimes I feel guilty because the two of them have been friends since high school and now Sandy can’t even talk to her on the phone.” “Dad, you don’t deserve half the money, but Mom won’t ignore a real need over here like this.” Davey said in a quiet but firm voice. “Let me talk to her, give me some time.” “Okay, son.” David Sr. said with a sigh. “Your grandmother might kill me, but I’ll drop the suit.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Now, why don’t you come and say hello to your aunt?” His father asked. “Brian, you’re going to love my Aunt Bev.” Davey said with a bright smile as he turned to me. “Just be careful or she’ll run you over with her wheelchair.” “Okay.” I said with a smile of my own while my feet winced in remembered pain. Okay, maybe these feet didn’t remember the pain of her wheelchair running over them, but I did have those memories, and the woman could be quite vicious when she wanted to make a point. Chapter 15 It was amazing what a simple apology could do. Some people have made a science of apologizing, both now and in the future. Certainly for anyone in the public spotlight knowing how to give the correct apology at the correct time was an important thing to know. Sometimes a bouquet of flowers with a simple note saying “I’m Sorry” would heal over a spat between lovers. It could be a box of chocolates, or a special trip including a favorite activity of the person being apologized to would work. Other times, giving a good apology required a complicated series of events, or endless repetition. There were people who didn’t want to hear a simple “I’m Sorry.” They want to hear you explain why you’re sorry, and what you did wrong first, and then the words. Still others wouldn’t listen to any apology at all, but rather required a long series of actions before they would accept the apology. David Jones Sr. had a lot to apologize for in this timeline, and he had a lot of people to whom he needed to apologize. Each of them required a different style of approach, a different form of apology, and none of them were inclined to forgive him anytime soon. The little stunt with the aborted attempt to get some of Sandy’s lottery money had only made the hurdles higher, and I was both surprised and pleased when he started making overtures right away. The next Saturday after Davey confronted him, he walked over to Pete and Monta’s house. Dad and I had been invited by Pete to join him and Davey on a fishing trip. It had been a good trip, and we’d come back in the late afternoon with the legal limit of fish. Davey’s father showed up just as we finished unloading the van, and Pete tensed up, as did Davey, but it was Davey who went to confront his father while Pete watched warily. “What do you want?” Davey asked sternly. “I… I would like to speak to your mother.” David Sr. said in a cautious voice. “Why?” Davey’s voice dripped with suspicion. “These are the official papers dropping the lawsuit.” His father answered while holding up a sheaf of papers in his hands. “I’ve also got papers filed for starting the divorce proceedings, if she wants. This way she doesn’t have to pay for anything.” “Okay.” Davey said with a hint of anger in his voice and he turned back to look at his grandfather who stared at the two of them for a long moment before nodding. “I’ll go get her.” Pete said gruffly and walked into the house. Sandy came out a few minutes later with an apprehensive look on her face. “Pete says you have something for me, Dave.” She said frostily and her husband handed over one set of papers. “Here’s the papers dropping the suit.” He said to her. “It was wrong of me to file them. I have no right to any of that, and I’m sorry.” “You’re damn right you have no right.” Sandy snarled, but she also relaxed a bit as she took the papers. “What made you do it?” “My mother.” He said with a heavy sigh and she actually laughed briefly before shaking her head. “That doesn’t make me any less responsible. I’m the one who did it, even if she was pushing me. It’s my responsibility.” “It’s about damn time you took responsibility for your mistakes.” Pete grumbled from where he stood behind Sandy. David Jones Sr. just nodded, agreeing with Pete and forcing a look of surprise to the older man’s face. “I… I also have papers here to start the proceedings for a divorce.” David Sr. said and Sandy gasped slightly. “You want a divorce?” She said in a voice that sounded horrified. “No, I don’t, but you might.” He said softly. “I’ve made so many mistakes, done so many things wrong I can’t blame you if you want one, but I know that before you couldn’t afford one. You can now, but I am the one who’s brought us to this point in our relationship, I’m the one who destroyed our family, and I’m the one who should take this step, or at least offer it to you if it is what you want. You’ve done nothing wrong. In fact, you’ve been doing things right, the way I should have. You’ve put the needs of the kids first, and put a stop to–to the things that I was doing that were wrong.” “I… put those away.” Sandy said to him with a weak voice. “I’m not saying I won’t want a divorce, but not right now. You’ve never… you’ve never accepted responsibility for what you did before. Your daughter needs to hear you say that.” “She will, whenever you and she are ready.” He replied in a voice that shook only a little bit. “Thank you, Dave.” She said in a quiet, but clear dismissal. “You deserve it, and more.” He said before turning to go. He took two steps before stopping and turning back. “Sandy, I almost forgot. Bev wanted me to say she misses you and Jenny. Would it be okay for her to come and visit?” “Anytime.” Sandy replied evenly and he nodded before resuming his course back to his mother’s house. When he was out of sight, Sandy turned and buried her head against Davey’s chest while she shook with her sobs. Dad touched my shoulder and nodded towards the house. I followed him and Pete inside while Davey comforted his mother. As spring turned into summer, that day marked a turning point for Davey and his family. It took another three weeks for them to move into the new house. During that time, Davey would stay with us during the week, and my room often reeked of the sex we would have in there at night, but on Friday night he’d go back to Pete and Monta’s house and not return until Sunday night. I found that I was okay with that, because it gave me time to rebuild my friendship with Brandon and Trevor, as well as to continue getting to know Todd better. The weekend where Sandy, Davey, and Jenny moved into their new home saw all of us showing up to help out with the move. Sandy had bought a bunch of new furniture for the house, and had spent the last few weeks totally revamping not only her wardrobe, but her childrens’ as well. Davey looked quite good in the matching outfits she bought for him, as did Jenny. To my surprise, David Sr. was also there, helping out with the move, as were Bev’s son Bryan and Bev herself – although she spent much of the time in her wheelchair directing everyone where to put things. When our Junior year of high school ended, Davey had a big party at his house with most of his friends, and several of mine. Sandy wasn’t there that weekend, and Davey shocked me when he told me that she was in San Francisco for the weekend with his father. I knew that they had started going to counseling with Jenny’s therapist as a family, but I hadn’t known things were going in the direction of his parents getting back together. I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but both Davey and his sister seemed to be happy with that development. In July, Davey got to spend two weeks with Brandon, Trevor, and me at a football camp in Minnesota. At first he was the worst player at the camp, but by the end of the two weeks, he had progressed so far that I was confident he’d make first string on the Varsity team at school. We made a good team on defense together, and while I knew he’d never been into baseball the way it was in the last timeline, I could see the abilities that had made him a good player shining through with some concentrated training and attention. It was a few days after we got back from football camp that things changed yet again. His mother had bought some excellent weight equipment and put it on their spacious back patio just like in the last timeline. Three days a week, I’d go over and we’d work out together. Most of the time, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd would meet up with us as well, and we’d go out for milkshakes or just hang out after the workout. That day, it was just the two of us until Todd opened the sliding glass door and walked out on the patio, followed by a familiar face. “Hey!” Davey called happily from where he stood spotting me on the bench press. While I put the bar back on its rest, he crossed over to meet Todd and hug him tightly. “We didn’t think you were coming!” “I had a guest come over.” Todd said and stood out of the way as I stood up and went to stand by them. “Davey, you might remember Sean from La Loma.” “Oh, yeah, hey Sean!” Davey said with a genuine smile as he held out his hand. Sean looked uncomfortable, but shook Davey’s hand. “I haven’t seen you since before we moved to Nevada. How ya doing?” “I’m okay.” Sean mumbled before looking at me with a look that wasn’t exactly pleasant. “Sean, do you know Brian?” Todd asked and Sean hung his head slightly. “Yeah.” He mumbled. “Hi Sean.” I said as cheerfully as I could. He looked so young. While he wasn’t as tall as I seemed to remember him being in the last timeline, he was still taller than he had been our freshman year. His face was paler though, far more freckled, and he had almost no muscle on him at all. In fact, he was as slender as a bean pole. “Hi.” Sean mumbled back. “I think I owe you an apology.” I said in as soft a voice as I could. Davey looked at me sharply while Todd nodded politely and Sean looked at me with bewilderment. “What do you mean?” Sean mumbled in confusion. “Back in Freshman year, you got stuffed in a trashcan at school.” I stated carefully, mostly because “I” had not been there, but the “me” of this timeline had been there. “I didn’t stop it from happening, and that was wrong. No one should be treated like that.” “Oh man, I’d forgotten about that.” Davey said sympathetically and he looked back at Sean. “Sean, I am so sorry I didn’t do anything to stop it either. Brian’s right, that was wrong of us.” “I deserved it.” Sean mumbled. “You don’t have to apologize to me.” “Bullshit.” Todd snorted. “No Sean, you’re wrong.” I said firmly. “No one deserves to be treated like that, and I hope that one day you might be able to forgive us for that. I just hope we can be friends from now on.” “You don’t want to be friends with me.” Sean mumbled and then he looked angrily at Todd. “You brought me here on purpose, didn’t you? You set me up.” “Hold on, Sean.” Davey said as the smaller guy started to walk away. Davey went up to him and put his hand on Sean’s shoulder. The guy flinched at that, but he stopped and turned around. “What?” Sean snapped angrily. “Why do you think you deserved what happened back then?” Davey asked him calmly and Sean’s shoulders slumped. “You’ll probably hear about it anyway.” Sean mumbled and then hung his head, probably trying to hide the tear that dripped down his cheek. “Dad already warned the pastor at the church and he told the youth pastor so by the time school starts everyone will know. I’m queer.” “So?” Davey asked in a voice that didn’t sound anything but confused. Sean had stiffened as he said the last part, and now he was staring at Davey in total confusion. “So, I’m a fag.” Sean snapped angrily. “I’m a fudgepacker. They’ve sent me to all sorts of quacks to make me straight but it doesn’t fucking work!” “Of course it doesn’t work.” Davey shrugged. “If you’re gay, you’re gay. Shame on those quacks taking your parents’ money for something they can’t change.” “Then again maybe his parents deserve to lose their money like that for trying to make him change.” I added and now Sean was staring at both of us with wide eyes while Todd practically split his face in two with his smile. “I… you… you’re all crazy!” Sean exclaimed. “I told you that you’d be better off back here in Modesto.” Todd said with an I-told-you-so expression on his face. “What are your friends going to say if they see you hanging around me?” Sean muttered. “You don’t even know me!” “We used to know you years ago, Sean.” I said in a gentle tone. “You were a good guy back then, and I’d be downright shocked if you weren’t still a good guy. If any of our friends have a problem with you, they have a problem with us and aren’t worth being our friends.” “Brian’s right.” Davey said firmly before looking back at me with a smile. “You think we’re done, Brian? I could use a milkshake. It’s getting hot. Then maybe we could come back and go for a swim.” “I don’t have any money for a milkshake.” Sean said. “It’s on me.” Davey said firmly. “I was your friend back in Freshman year and I totally dropped the ball on being a good friend back then. I’ve got a lot of making up to do for that.” “I don’t have a swimsuit.” Sean mumbled. “Then I’ll get you one on the way back.” I said firmly. “It’s the least I can do…” “You don’t have to do this.” Sean mumbled. “No, we don’t, but we want to do this.” I said firmly. He just shook his head, which Davey and I took as consent. When we got to the Snowy’s that made the best milkshakes in town, Sean had started to come out of his shell just a bit. I wasn’t surprised to see Brandon and Trevor there, and when they came over to join us, Sean started to go back into his shell a bit. Trevor didn’t remember him at all, but there was something in Brandon’s eyes that told me he remembered Sean. My two oldest friends joined us in heading back to Davey’s pool, even stopping at the sporting goods store to get Sean a set of swimming trunks. To my surprise, Brandon had whispered something to Trevor while we were walking into the store, and the two of them came up to Sean and apologized to him for the incident in Freshman year. Then they both pitched in for Sean’s swimsuit. “I can’t wear this!” Sean muttered as he looked at the dark green Speedo that Brandon was holding up for him. “Dude, it’d look good on you.” Brandon insisted and I caught the look in his eyes. So did Davey, who gave me a little smile while Sean continued to protest. “We all should get Speedos.” Todd suggested with a bright grin as he looked at Trevor. Oh yeah, I knew what the red head was thinking, wanting to see the school’s star quarterback in a Speedo. “Okay.” Davey said with a leer of his own. “No way.” Sean protested weakly, but his eyes almost bugged out as Davey held up a pair of white Speedos with red stripes on the hips. It was very difficult for me not to start drooling right then and there. Regular workouts had helped Davey shed those extra pounds and the thought of him in that was absolutely worthy of a bucket of drool. I was starting to laugh until Davey threw the white Speedos at me. “These are for you.” Davey said emphatically while pulling out another white Speedo, although this one had blue stripes. “These are for me.” “Cool.” I said while Brandon picked out a blue Speedo. We all paid for our Speedos, with Trevor having picked out a black pair and Todd a red pair that was going to clash madly with his hair. All of us pitched in for Sean’s over his continued protests. Then we set off for Davey’s house. “Let’s get changed!” Davey’s voice showed his excitement as we all rushed up to his room and started to change. Sean turned white and fled out of the room, down the hallway to the bathroom. “What’s his problem?” Brandon said in an offended tone. “He’s shy.” Todd said defensively with a warning look at Davey and me. “He’s not a jock like you guys.” “We’ll get him over that by the time summer’s out.” Brandon said confidently. When Sean reappeared with a towel wrapped around him, no one said anything. By the time we reached the pool, he was a lot calmer, and although he waited until he was next to the pool before taking off the towel and slipping into the water. At first he hung back while Davey and Brandon got into a splash war, but soon he was swimming around and playing like the rest of us. It was good to see that, as my conscience was screaming at me. Sean had been a good friend in the last timeline, and had sacrificed much over the years, as much as Davey had, if not more. He deserved to be happy now, even if he didn’t remember those times. Seeing the way Brandon reacted to him was another good thing as far as I was concerned. It was very obvious to me, and probably to Davey that Brandon was interested in Sean as more than a possible friend. Watching them dance around each other was going to be fun. The weeks that followed were as close to perfect as anything could be in life. Every day I was over at Davey’s house, and Sean was there almost constantly with Todd. Brandon was there quite a bit too, and while Trevor was still spending time with his newest girlfriend, he was there more days than not. Mom and Sandy were moving along with their Event Planning business as well. They had three clients already, and were deep in working with those people. Two of the clients were weddings, both referred by Sandy’s family members, and the third was actually a political fundraiser for a City Council candidate that my mother knew from one of the local charities she worked with. Sandy had even ‘hired’ Davey’s Aunt Bev to help with the planning and arrangements. The woman may have been confined to a wheelchair, but she was ecstatic with the work, and was over nearly every day, forcing her husband, or Davey’s father to get her ready and drive her to the house. On the phone she was a living terror to the different vendors they were using. Her quick wit, and ample vocabulary meant that anyone who didn’t perform up to her expectations got a tongue-lashing they would not soon forget. Whoever was over when she started in on someone over the phone would gather outside the office she used and listen. After she was done, she’d start in on us for giggling while she was on the phone. Like all good things, though, it eventually came to an end when Sean’s father paid a visit Davey’s mother while we were out on a day trip to Sonora. On the way back home, we’d dropped Sean off with Todd at Todd’s house, and Davey and I had gone back to his house. We’d planned on spending the night since Pete was coming by the next morning to take us fishing up in the mountains. “Davey, Brian, I need to talk to both of you now.” His mother said in a stern voice as we walked in the front door. It was obvious she was pissed about something, but we shrugged and put down the bags filled with the things we’d bought for our mothers, and Davey’s sister. She shut the door behind us as we entered the office that had been President Jones’s in another timeline. There were three desks in here, and while it was still wood-paneled, it had a much more feminine feel to it now. “What’s up, Mom?” Davey asked in a slightly nervous voice. Both Bev and my mother were in the room, and while they didn’t look happy, their looks were directed more at Sandy than at us, which made me even more confused as to what was wrong. “What do you know about that Sean boy?” She asked and everything suddenly made sense. It was with a sinking feeling in my stomach that I guessed what had happened. “We went to La Loma together, and Downey until we moved to Nevada.” Davey began after a quick look at me. “He’s a good guy.” “How do you know that?” His mother asked sharply. “Did he tell you why his family moved to Southern California? Did he tell you that he’s been seeing a therapist for years now?” “Mom, Jenny’s been seeing a therapist for years, and for that matter, we’ve been going with her!” Davey retorted hotly. “What does that have to do with Sean?” “We’ve been seeing a therapist to help your sister recover from what was done to her.” His mother shouted. “He’s seeing one because he’s the one who’s perverted! Has he tried to touch you?” “What do you mean ‘has he tried to touch me’?” Davey asked with a sharp edge to his voice and I almost winced. “We goof around all the time, but then again so does Brian and me.” “Don’t try to play coy with me!” His mom shouted while my mom turned a bright pink and tried to suppress a bark of laughter. I had a sinking feeling in my gut as Beverly looked over at her, then at Davey, and finally at me. Her direct gaze caused a slight blush to my cheeks while Sandy kept yelling at her son. “You know damn well what I mean! Has that boy tried to touch you sexually?” “Not that it’s any of your business if he had, but no, of course not.” Davey said with a snort and the room reverberated with the sound of her slapping him. “Don’t you dare talk to me like that!” His mother shouted. “His father came over and told me what a little pervert he is! You’ll have nothing to do with him any more, and I never want to see him over here again. People like him should be locked away from the rest of society…” “Sandy!” Bev shouted as my mother’s face began to grow red, not from the earlier humor but from real anger. “What is it?” Sandy snapped as Bev turned on her electric wheelchair and maneuvered herself to Sandy’s side while mother stood up. “What’s wrong with you?” Bev snapped as she hit Sandy in the side with her arm. Davey’s Aunt had been crippled from the neck down in an auto accident years ago, but she was still able to move her arms. Her hands she really couldn’t do much with, but she was deadly when she lashed out with her arms like that. “What’s that for?” Sandy growled, rubbing the spot where Bev had hit her. “How dare you talk about Sean that way!” Bev snapped. “He’s a good boy and you know that.” “I thought my husband was a good father and you see where that got me!” Sandy snapped back. “I’ll not have my son put in danger that way.” “Please tell me you don’t really feel that way.” Mom said sadly. Her anger was gone, replaced by a deep sense of sadness. “What does it matter if Sean’s gay?” “What?” Davey’s mother nearly squeaked with her surprise. “How can you say that Brenda? Homosexuals are perverts, one and all! It says so in the bible! What’s more, they’re all sick! Look at that AIDS thing! All homosexuals get AIDS and they die. If that Sean boy is a homosexual, he’ll have AIDS and I’m not going to risk my son being infected by him!” “Brian, get your things.” Mom said with a note of finality and I knew better than to argue with her right now. “What’s going on?” Sandy demanded imperiously. “I’m sorry, Sandy, but I cannot associate with someone who believes those things.” Mom said with a strong hint of sadness in her voice. “My brother Rich died of AIDS, and I will not listen to you insult his memory.” “You see!” Sandy said in a triumphant tone. “He probably got infected by homosexuals! That was his apartment, right? The one mom stayed at? He probably got it from them! Those homosexuals deserve every last bit of suffering God delivers to them.” “My Uncle Rich was the kindest, most caring person I’ve ever known.” I said through gritted teeth, remembering this woman caring for a young boy named Jeremy in another timeline. Suddenly I was homesick for that timeline, and I didn’t blame Sean one bit for not wanting to come back to this world. “I’m sure he was, but that’s what happens when you associate with homosexuals.” Sandy said. “I am ending our business relationship effective this moment.” Mom said through gritted teeth. “Why?” Sandy demanded with narrowed eyes. “Because Uncle Rich was gay, mother.” Davey said with a snort. “You can be so dense at times.” “I… um… look, I’m just overreacting.” Sandy began in an insincere apology. “Save it, Sandy.” Mom said angrily. “Right now I’m so angry nothing you can say will make a difference.” “But can’t you see that this is for the good of our boys?” Sandy asked in almost a whining tone. “We can’t have them perverted by that boy…” “Stop right there, Sandy.” Bev practically snarled, cutting off Davey’s mother who looked at her in shock. “Bev, you know that…” She started to protest. “I know that you’re not thinking, just reacting.” Bev snapped at her. “If you were thinking you’d have noticed something.” “What’s that?” Sandy snapped at her in frustration as she crossed her arms over her chest and glared at her sister-in-law sitting calmly in the wheelchair. “Doesn’t it strike you as odd that your son isn’t reacting in surprise at hearing that his friend is a homosexual, or that he knew that Brian’s uncle was one?” Bev asked and I cursed for not remembering how quick Davey’s aunt was. Sometimes I think he got the ability to think so quickly from her, instead of his mother or father. “What?” Sandy exclaimed in surprise while she turned to face her son who had gone slightly pale. “You knew about this and kept it from me?” “I… it wasn’t any of your business.” Davey said weakly and I had to flinch at the reaction on Sandy’s face. Part of me wanted to jump to his defense, but I knew this was his battle to fight, and I knew that I would not have been all too happy if either of our boys had spoken to me like that. “What do you mean it wasn’t my business?” She shouted and Davey did flinch in a major way this time. “How dare you say it isn’t my business? You’re my son and if something puts you in danger, it damn well is my business.” “I haven’t ever been in any danger, mother.” Davey said with sarcasm dripping from his voice. That did not bode well either. “Go to your room.” Sandy ordered. “I’ll deal with you later.” “No.” Davey said in firm, and flat, voice. “What do you mean no?” She demanded angrily. “You’re my son and as long as you live in my house you will do what I tell you!” “I’m seventeen, mother.” He said flatly in a voice that I knew foretold a lot of trouble. Unfortunately, his mother was so angry she probably didn’t recognize the tone. “If you want to go down this road, fine. I can leave.” “You leave this house and you’ll be cut off!” She shouted, growing flushed in the face. “Davey.” My mother said in a calm voice. Her face showed her worry. As she spoke the single word, she gathered the attention of everyone in the room. “What?” Davey asked in a harsh tone. It was obvious he was trying to not snap at her, which was a good thing. “I think everyone needs to take a deep breath.” My mother said in a slightly calm voice. “I thought you wanted nothing to do with me?” Sandy snapped waspishly at her. “I don’t, but your son and his relationship with you is a little more important than my anger at you for the moment.” My mother replied. “I don’t need your help to manage my son, Brenda.” Sandy sneered at her. “Don’t talk to her like that.” Davey snapped at her and she turned back to him and opened her mouth to deliver a tirade when Bev ran over her foot. “Ow!” Sandy shouted as she hopped around on her other foot, glaring at Bev who shrugged her shoulders. Davey had a tough time not bursting out in laughter, but he was hiding a big smile behind a hand. “I swear, Sandy, I get enough of this at home from my mother.” Bev said with an exasperated sigh as Sandy hopped around for another moment. She was glaring fiercely at Bev now, but her mouth was staying shut. “I’m sorry, Aunt Bev.” Davey said in a slightly meek tone. “You need to apologize to your mother.” Bev told Davey sharply. “For what?” His voice almost cracked and he looked stunned. “I thought you were on my side!” “I’m on no one’s side.” Bev retorted. “No matter what, she is your mother and deserves more respect than you’ve shown her tonight.” “You’re right.” Davey said after a long moment of thinking. He stood a little straighter and turned to face his mother. “I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you.” “What about what you said?” His mother retorted in a voice that sounded just as angry as before. “I’m not going to apologize for that.” Davey said firmly and she looked like she was about to go off on him again before Bev moved her wheelchair in a warning gesture. “We’re all intelligent people in this room.” Bev said softly and then she looked over at me with a penetrating stare. “Brian, you’ve been awful quiet. What do you have to say?” “I don’t know if anyone wants to hear my opinion right now.” I said with a shrug, trying to stay out of this mess. “I do.” Davey said softly. “I’d like to hear what he has to say.” My mother said just as softly and everyone turned to look at Sandy who stared at me for a long moment before also nodding. “If I was your parent and you spoke to me like that, I’d be pissed as hell.” I said to Davey and he looked hurt for a moment, before nodding slightly. Sandy looked triumphant until I turned to stare at her. “If I was your son, I’d be ashamed to be related to you.” “What?” Sandy gasped in surprise. “Have you given any thought to what Sean’s father hoped to accomplish by coming over here?” I asked her and her eyes widened in surprise. “Have you given a moment to think that there might be more to this story than you’re hearing from the man? If you had, you might have started this by asking some questions instead of assuming you knew everything you needed to know. If you’d done that you might have realized you were being played by that man.” “What do you mean?” Sandy asked with a hint of anger in her voice, but her eyes told me she was at least thinking. “Davey and I know a lot about Sean and what he’s been going through for the last couple of years.” I said softly. “Did you know that his father had him committed to a mental institution? Did you know that at that place they put electrodes on his penis and shocked him every time he showed any reaction to a picture of a man instead of a woman?” “That… that’s barbaric.” Sandy said with a shudder. “That’s what his father had done to him, and that was the nice stuff.” I continued mercilessly and she shook her head in disbelief. “He’s been kept isolated, he’s been forced to do so many disgusting things I don’t even want to think about them. That man hates his son and won’t rest until he’s made every minute of his son’s life miserable. In the last few weeks, Sean has actually had a few happy moments, most of them over here, and his father is trying to take that away from him.” “But… but the boy is a homosexual.” Davey’s mother protested. “Does that mean he deserves to be treated badly by his own parents?” Davey asked her and she looked at him for a second before turning back to me. “They realize that Sean’s old enough now that they don’t have long to control him.” I continued. “If he ran away again, and he’s done that a few times, they’d end up in trouble because Child Services down in Southern California investigated them. That’s one of the real reasons they moved back up here, so they wouldn’t be watched so much by the government for abusing their son.” “You’re kidding.” Sandy commented, but her voice showed she was believing me. “No, I’m not.” I stated. “Mom, Sean hates his parents now as much as they hate him.” Davey said in a much calmer voice. “The day he turns eighteen, he’s leaving their house. He doesn’t care if has to live on the street to get away from them, but the second he’s of legal age he’s walking out their door with nothing but the shirt on his back.” “And he’ll be better off for it despite having nothing.” I added and she looked horrified. “He’s just a boy, though.” Davey’s mother said. “It happens all the time, Sandy.” Brenda said softly. “Young men like him get thrown out of their homes, or leave because the situation is so unbearable, like it is for Sean, that they would prefer to be homeless than to live in that horror. Sean’s lucky, though. He’s got friends who are willing to stick up for him like Davey and Brian.” “But he’s a homosexual.” Sandy protested again, looking at her son. “I can’t have him putting you in danger.” “I’m in no more danger from him than Brian is from me.” Davey said and I had to do my best to not react to the implications of his words. Unfortunately, his mother caught them too, and the look on her face was filled with surprise, horror, and disbelief. Oh shit. Chapter 16 The silence in the room was deafening following Davey’s statement to his mother. The way she kept opening and closing her mouth made me think of a fish. My mother had gone pale, and Bev was staring at him with wide eyes. What surprised me the most was the calm look on Davey’s face. I had to wonder if he was going insane at that moment. “What are you saying?” Sandy asked Davey at long last. Her voice was weak, and I thought she might be on the verge of passing out. “If just being around Sean was a danger to me, then I must be a danger to Brian or anyone else I’m around, like Jenny for instance.” Davey said calmly and now I was growing more confused. What was the point he was trying to make? “Huh?” Bev asked in a voice that sounded every bit as confused as I felt. “What does Jenny have to do with this?” His mother asked sharply. Her temper was starting to flare up now. “Look at what Dad did to her.” Davey said softly. “I’ve been around Dad all my life. I idolized him, and he was molesting her all those years.” “That… that’s different.” Sandy said defensively. “That… what made your father do those things isn’t something you catch from just being around him.” “But Sean being gay is something I can catch?” Davey asked with a slight tilt of his head. “No, it’s not that.” His mother said defensively. “It’s the AIDS thing. You can catch that from him.” “Then I shouldn’t be around you either.” Davey countered and her face flushed with more anger. “Why do you say that?” She snapped. “You’re just as much at risk as Sean is, well more really.” Davey said to her and she looked stunned. “Sean isn’t having sex with guys, which is how he’d catch it. You had two blood transfusions during your surgeries. Look at that Ryan White kid. That’s how he got it, from a blood transfusion.” “I… how dare you?” She fumed, and she was starting to shake badly as she turned so she didn’t have to look at him. “Mom, I’m sorry.” Davey said softly and she turned back to look at him. “I know you don’t like to think about that, but it was a danger they told you about before the surgery. I know it worries you, but it’s there. If Sean being gay isn’t what puts me in danger from being around him, and you say it’s AIDS, you have to admit that your surgery makes you every bit as much a danger.” “It’s different.” She asserted. “How?” He asked her softly. “It just is.” She insisted, but she looked like she even knew the inanity of that argument. “I know that Sean being gay isn’t something you like, Sandy, but isn’t it his life?” My mother said in a gentle voice. “He’s Davey’s friend, Sandy.” Bev said softly. “I’ll admit, it doesn’t make me comfortable thinking about that… part of his life, but isn’t Davey the person who should decide if they stay friends or not? Davey’s almost an adult now, and he’s proven that he’s more than capable of acting like an adult.” “I wonder about that sometimes.” Sandy muttered as she looked at her son. “You don’t have to like him, Mother.” Davey said gently. “But he’s my friend and I’m not going to abandon him just because you don’t like him. If you don’t want him coming over here, fine. We’ll all go someplace else.” “That’s reasonable.” My mother said at once. “There’s no reason you boys can’t come over to the house, or go somewhere else. We don’t have a pool, but there are plenty of other things to do.” “I… I like having all of you come over here.” Sandy said defensively. “Either all my friends are welcome, or we can go someplace else.” Davey said firmly, but still in a gentle tone. “It’s not fair to any of them to be excluded like that.” “You’re really fine with Sean being a… homosexual?” Sandy asked my mother. “I loved my brother very much, Sandy.” My mother said gently. “Most of our family rejected him, but despite that he was still there for me when I needed help the most. No one else from my family lifted a finger to help me, but he did. I gave him a chance, and what I found was that he wasn’t really all that different because he preferred men. He still wanted to love someone, and to be loved. It’s not like what you see on television, at those parades you know. I mean sure, some are like that, but most gay people I’ve known in my life aren’t really like that. It’s just the news shows those people because they’re so…” “Outrageous.” I said when my mother faltered while looking for the right word. She nodded at me. “If he tries anything, you’ll tell me, right?” Davey’s mother asked him gently as her shoulders sagged in defeat. “Yes.” Davey promised and I sighed with relief of my own. For a moment, I had thought he had gone insane, but once again Davey had proved he could think better in tight situations than I could imagine. “Fine, why don’t you and Brian go do something?” She said with an air of defeat while she looked at my mother. “Brenda, I think the three of us should talk.” “Yes, we should.” My mother replied while Davey and I left their office. It struck me as odd that this was twice now, in two different timelines, that Sean’s father had caused an argument over his son to be fought out in this room. Davey sighed with relief as we headed up to his bedroom, not really saying anything until the door was shut and he was pulling me into a very tight hug. “Jesus that was close.” He mumbled against me while I put my arms around him even as his shoulders began to shake with gentle sobs. We stood like that for a while, he and I standing with our arms wrapped around each other while he cried into my shoulder. Finally he stopped crying and pulled back while I lowered my arms to my side. He wiped his eyes and gave me a small smile. “Thanks.” “Anything for you.” I said softly. “Do you mean that, Brian?” He asked me and I nodded my reassurance. “Good. I almost fucked up there big time.” “For a moment I thought you were going to tell your mother about us.” I said quietly and he chuckled softly while shaking his head. “That’s what I was going to do until I saw her face.” Davey stated. “When I saw her face I knew it’d be a mistake so I made up that other shit.” “That’s something I’ve always admired about you.” I told him. “You’re able to think so quickly on your feet like that. I’d have never been able to jump on that track about your father and her blood transfusion without having a lot of time to think about it first.” “Thanks.” Davey said as his smile slipped. “So you’ll understand what needs to happen now.” “What are you talking about?” I asked as a sliver of fear wormed its way to my gut. Where was his mind going now? “You and me, we can’t keep doing this, at least for now.” Davey said with a frown and I felt like I wanted to start shaking as my stomach dropped to my feet. “We can be friends, but nothing more. She can’t have any reason to suspect us.” “If you’re worried about her kicking you out…” I started to say but he shook his head. “That’s not it.” He said sadly. “I know your parents would give me a place with them. It’d kill my mother though, if she knew. I can’t have her looking at me like that, thinking those things about me. We’ll still be friends, though, and maybe after high school, when we’re in college we can pick up where we left off, but I can’t do this.” “You’re going to let your mother rule your life like this?” I asked him as my anger started to kick in and regretted it instantly. “You just said you’d do anything for me.” He shot back angrily. “Were they just words or did you mean them? I’m not kicking you out of my life, I’m just saying we need to keep it at the level of just being friends. What, you can’t stand the thought of not having sex?” “It’s not the sex I’m worried about, Davey.” I said sharply and he shook his head again. “Then what are you worried about?” He asked. “Davey, it’s wrong for you to put your life on hold for your mother and sister.” I argued. “That’s what you think.” He said with a hurt tone. “Look, you’re the one who said you always have to think things through. Well, go think about this. You’ll figure out I’m right. All we’re stopping is the sex, and the hugging and kissing stuff. We’re still going to be friends, right?” “Right.” I said with a heavy sigh. “I don’t like this Davey. What are you going to do next, date a girl?” “I might have to do that.” Davey said with a shrug. “Mom and Nanny are always asking me when I’m going to get a girlfriend. Nanny keeps pushing this Julie girl at me. Her mother is a volunteer at the hospital with Nanny. She goes to our school, so maybe I can date her and throw them off the track.” “She’s going to expect you to kiss her.” I warned him and he blushed. “It won’t mean anything, Brian.” He said with a heavy sigh. “It’s just maintaining my cover.” “I’m going to go.” I said abruptly as a feeling swept over me to get the hell out of there. The thought of Davey kissing anyone, whether he meant it or not, was too much for me to deal with right now. “Brian, please…” Davey’s voice trailed off with a hurt tone and I turned back to look at him. There were fresh tears in his eyes, but then there were new ones in mine too. “Don’t be mad. Just think about it.” “I will.” I said softly. “I’m not mad, though. I’m hurt, and I’m a little confused as to how you think this is best, but I’m not mad. I love you, Davey.” “I know.” He said softly, looking down at his feet as I shut his bedroom door behind me and made my way out of the house. It was a good thing that I didn’t run into anyone on the way out because by the time I got into my car, I was bawling like a little child. Several hours later my crying had turned into sniffling as I lay on my bed, clutching a pillow to my chest. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was going to lose Davey. No matter how similar this Davey was to the one I’d known and loved, even I had to admit they were very different people. My Davey had decades of experience this one didn’t have, and he’d told me the type of person he’d been at this age. How could I have been foolish enough to expect that this Davey would be faithful to me, would be willing to defy his family and risk their approval of him? “Brian, are you in there?” Mom’s voice from the other side of my door forced me to push back a few more sniffles, wipe my puffed-up eyes and focus back on the present. “I’m in here.” I said and was surprised at how much my voice shook. “Is everything alright, dear?” She asked in a worried tone and before I could say anything, she opened the door and took a very long look at me. “I thought something was up from the way you stormed out of there, and now I have a better idea of what’s going on.” “You do?” I asked in surprise. “What has Davey done now?” She asked with a sigh. “I swear, sometimes that kid can get as mixed up as his mother and grandmother. Does this have something to do with that Julie girl he’s supposed to be meeting for dinner tonight?” “Huh?” I mumbled in surprise as my heart dropped back down into my stomach again. Yep, that was Davey alright. Once he made a decision, he moved forward with it at full speed, and damn any of the consequences. “I was wondering why he was calling a girl to go out.” Mom said sadly. “Let me guess, he doesn’t want his mom to figure out about you two so he’s going to date this Julie girl. Do I have that about right?” “Yes.” I mumbled with a shake of my head. “Did you tell him how messed up that was and how much heartache it could cause?” She asked me. “No, not really.” I admitted softly. “I told him I don’t like it…” “Brian, for a guy who supposedly had experienced having grandchildren, you can spend a lot of time thinking like an ordinary teenager.” Mom said in an exasperated tone. “I’m not good at reacting to surprises.” I muttered miserably. He was already going out with Julie? A fresh batch of tears welled up in my eyes. “Oh my poor Brian.” Mom said sympathetically as those tears dribbled down my cheeks. She crossed the rooms and took me into her arms, where I cried hard enough to soak her blouse. I cried like that for a while, and when I slowed down, she started to dab my cheeks with a handkerchief. “Why don’t you go wash up while I start dinner. Don’t worry about Davey. We’ll all start working on talking some sense into him.” “Thank you, Mom.” I said, grateful once again to have my parents around. No matter how old I ever got, they were always a source of comfort and support for me. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep well that night, and the next day was a rough one for me. Trevor and Brandon showed up at my house, but they were surprised when I showed no interest in going over to Davey’s, or in doing anything else really. All I wanted to do was mope around for the day. They left after barely an hour, leaving me alone to work out on the weight machine that I had barely used in the last few months. We’d been using the sets at Davey’s. “What the hell is going on?” Todd’s voice interrupted me as he stormed onto the back patio just after noon. “What do you mean?” I asked him in a quiet voice. “I mean what’s up with you and Davey?” Todd spat back angrily. “He’s got some stupid girl named Julie over there making calf eyes at him and you’re nowhere around. His mom’s treating her like she’s the future daughter-in-law!” “Oh, Davey decided he’d rather pretend to be straight.” I muttered and Todd’s mouth hung open for a long time. For some reason that put a small smile on my face. “What are you smiling about?” Todd finally demanded. “You should be over there telling him he’s being an idiot!” “I was wondering if a fly really would fly into your mouth.” I chuckled and he shook his head. “Don’t change the subject.” He said sharply. “What are you going to do about that idiot? He’s already kissed her in front of everyone!” “He has?” I asked as my heart sank again. That was getting to be all too familiar a feeling. “Yes.” Todd said with disgust. “Then I guess he and I really are over.” I mumbled and Todd crossed his arms. “You’re only over if you let him do this stupid shit.” Todd said with determination and his foot was tapping on the cement. “Now I’ll ask it again, what are you going to do to stop his idiocy? He doesn’t belong with her, he belongs with you. Then again, if you’re available now, I think I might try pursuing you. You make a good boyfriend.” “I’m honored.” I said with a mocking bow of my head. “Sorry, Todd. You’re a good friend, but I’m not interested in you that way.” “Your loss.” Todd shrugged. “Do you want Davey back?” “Don’t be stupid, of course I do.” I growled. “He’s mine.” “Then you got to get him back.” Todd said as he started to pace. “Now, Davey’s as stubborn as his damn mother, so just talking to him won’t do any good. You’re going to have to make him jealous. I know! You can pick a girl and start dating her! Kiss her in front of him and let him see how it feels!” “I’m not going to lead some poor girl on that way.” I said with determination. “Well then, how about another guy?” He asked. “It’d have to be someone we already know, and you’ll have to do it carefully so no one outside our group knows. I see two choices, really. Me or Trevor.” “Why you or Trevor?” I asked with real curiosity. “Well, after they saw that there was a girl around, Brandon and Sean took off together.” Todd said with a sly grin. “I think they’re really hitting it off good.” “Good for them.” I said with genuine feeling. “I’m not sure about this jealousy thing though. It could really backfire.” “It won’t.” Todd said quickly. “You’d be willing to do this for me?” I asked him with a little surprise. “In a heartbeat.” Todd smiled. “Although if it was real, it’d be even better. You’re a good guy, Brian. But, if I can’t be your boyfriend I’ll take being your friend that helps you out whenever you need it.” “We don’t need to take it that far!” I said quickly as my cheeks blushed. “I know.” Todd teased me. “Davey doesn’t need to know that until later, though, right?” “No, no he doesn’t.” I agreed and Todd held out his hand. We shook then and he gave me a simpering glance. “So, should we practice kissing just to make it look real?” He asked with a hopeful tone. “Not just yet.” I said sternly. Now I had butterflies in my stomach. Part of me said this was stupid, that it could backfire so easily, but I also knew Davey and I didn’t want him sticking his dick in some girl just to secure his cover with his mother. It was three more days before I saw Davey again. After the second day where it was becoming evident Julie was a semi-permanent fixture, along with three of her girlfriends, everyone started meeting over at my house. >From there we’d go and do whatever we felt like that day, without Davey. The phone rang one morning, just after Mom had left for Sandy’s house and Dad had headed off to his work. I picked it up, and pretty much regretted it instantly when I heard Davey’s voice on the other line. Part of me wanted to hang up at his cheerful tone, but I didn’t. “What do you want?” I asked a little more harshly than I should have. “I… I want to see you.” Davey replied in a slightly weak voice. “I miss having you and the guys around. Did you tell them not to come over anymore?” “No.” I answered immediately. “Davey, they can’t be themselves with your… girlfriend and her friends around so they go where they’re more comfortable.” “So you didn’t tell them to stay away from me?” He asked plaintively. “No.” I replied. “I wouldn’t do something like that.” “Can we do something today?” He asked me in what was almost a whine. “I miss you already.” “What do you want to do?” I asked as the desire to see him overcame my anger for a moment. “We could go to the mall.” He said in a slightly happier tone. “Julie’s birthday is next weekend and I was thinking of getting her a necklace.” “Let me get this straight.” I said sharply as anger welled up inside of me. “You want to take the guy you dumped because your mother might guess we were a couple, and have him go with you to buy a necklace for some bimbo you’re seeing?” “Julie’s not a bimbo.” Davey said defensively. “No, I guess she’s not, but then neither am I.” I practically yelled into the phone before slamming it down. For several minutes I fumed, cussing out Davey and his idiotic thinking before deciding I really did need to do something. Trevor was doing something with his father today. Brandon was with his siblings and had Sean over, so that left Todd, whose crazy idea wasn’t sounding so bad just about now. “Hello?” Todd said as I called his number. “Hey, it’s Brian.” I said in a neutral tone. “Yo, dude, what’s up?” He asked in a happier tone. “I was wondering if you wanted to do something today.” I sort of asked him. “Uh, yeah, I was just sitting around.” He replied. “I’ve got the day off.” “Cool, how about I pick you up?” I asked. “About an hour?” “Fine by me.” He said happily and I hung up the phone. Almost exactly an hour later I was showered, shaved, and wearing a pair of khaki pants with one of my tightest blue t-shirts. “Where to?” He asked me as he got into the mustang. “How about the mall?” I asked with a perverse idea. Davey would probably be there, and even though I knew better, I wanted him to see me there with Todd. “Fine by me.” Todd said. “So, you hear from Davey lately?” “Yeah.” I said as my good mood evaporated. “Oh, how’d that go?” He asked. “He accused me of telling you guys to stay away from him.” I started off and Todd shook his head. “I told him you guys probably just weren’t comfortable with his girl and her friends there.” “That’s for sure.” Todd grumbled. “So, do you think Sean and Brandon are going to hook up?” “It’d be nice.” I answered. “You think they’ve actually done anything yet?” “They’ve fooled around.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Sean spent the next day praying on his knees for forgiveness, but as soon as Brandon called him he went right over. That boy is still mixed up in the head.” “Yeah, well, he has us to support him.” I stated. “Yup.” Todd agreed as he smiled at me again. “You think anymore about my idea?” “Yeah, I thought about it.” I said with a sigh. “And?” Todd asked with a tilt of his head. “Davey asked me to go to the mall with him to help him pick out a necklace for Julie.” I said sourly. “That stupid son of a bitch!” Todd exclaimed and then he started laughing. “We’re going to the mall, right?” “Yup.” I answered with a knowing grin. “You can be an evil man, Brian.” Todd smirked as he reached across the seat to rub my leg. “Todd, don’t take it too far.” I warned him with a little growl. “I know, I know.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Just remember, if Davey never fucking wakes up and smells the coffee, you’ve got lots of options.” “I know, and I appreciate that, Todd.” I said with a sideways glance at him. “I like you. You’re a good guy, but I don’t feel that way about you. Maybe we shouldn’t do this. You’ll only end up getting hurt.” “No, I won’t.” Todd said with a slightly pained expression. “Yeah, it’ll suck if it works and you two get back together, but for a little while at least I can pretend, and maybe I’ll have an idea about what it’ll be like when I do meet someone as nice as you.” “Fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” I said a little fiercely and he smiled as we pulled into the parking lot of the mall. Vintage Fair mall hadn’t been remodeled since it was built in the 1970’s, and still reflected some of the psychedelic décor of that time period. It’d be another fifteen years before it was remodeled and would get stores like Abercrombie & Fitch, or Hollister. Many of the same jewelry stores were there, and I couldn’t help but stop and point out a nice gold chain meant for a man to Todd. “I like that one.” He said to me just as Davey walked up to us. I’d noticed him on the other side of the mall and he’d been watching us as we went up to the jewelry store. “Is this why you wouldn’t come with me?” Davey snarled without any preamble and I turned to see him with a face reddened by his anger. “You decided to get yourself a new boy-toy and you’re going to buy him something now?” “What does it matter to you if he is?” Todd snarled back. “You’re the one who broke things off with him so you could pretend with that Julie girl.” “Don’t get in the middle of this.” Davey snarled at him while I looked around to see if anyone was close enough to hear us. “Davey, you might want to be careful or someone will hear us.” I said calmly. “You know what, fuck you Brian Breckenridge.” Davey snarled. “Not anymore.” I growled back at him and he stepped back while his eyes widened and Todd chuckled. “What do you mean?” He asked. “C’mon, Davey, you know exactly what I mean.” I told him. “It didn’t take you long to go from just using her as a cover to kissing her all over the place. Sean told me how she had her hand down your bathing suit the other day.” “I didn’t want her to do that!” Davey snarled defensively. “I told her to take it out as soon as it happened!” “No you didn’t.” Todd sneered. “You waited at least a minute until you noticed other people were seeing it happen.” “We used to do that stuff all the time and no one ever thought it was a big deal.” Davey said defensively. “You’re right, you can do it all you want.” I snarled at him, finally letting the anger I was feeling really vent out. “Just don’t expect me to sit around and wait for you to get bored.” “I thought you said you’d always love me.” He almost whined. “I will always love you, Davey.” I answered honestly, meeting his hurt gaze with a hurt gaze of my own. “What you have to understand is that I don’t have to live my life with you even though I love you. Sure, I wanted to live my life with you, but, you know, I don’t know if you’re worth it.” “What?” Davey nearly shrieked. “You come back in time for me and don’t think I’m worth it anymore?” “Huh?” Todd said in confusion and I stared at Davey as realization dawned on his face. “It’s a private joke.” Davey temporized quickly and Todd shook his head in confusion. “Brian told me one time he’d even come back in time for me if he had to.” “You guys can have some weird conversations, or at least you used to have them.” Todd said with a shake of his head. “Shut up, dirtbag.” Davey told him sharply. “You couldn’t even wait a week before trying to sink your claws in Brian.” “Why not, you took less time than that to dump him for some cunt.” Todd sneered and Davey lashed out with a fist, catching Todd in the stomach and doubling him over. “That’s not what I did.” Davey said fiercely, but his eyes were pleading with me. “I have to do this. You understand, don’t you, Brian?” “I understand why you want to, but I don’t understand why you are stupid enough to think it’s the right thing to do.” I countered him while reaching out to support Todd who was clutching his gut. “I also don’t understand why you think it’s okay to hit Todd. I thought you were better than that.” “Maybe I’m just a stupid kid without decades and decades of growing up.” Davey sneered and I gave him a narrowed-eye look before shaking my head. “C’mon Todd, let’s get you out of here.” I said sadly as I walked away, supporting Todd and not even looking back at Davey Jones. Chapter 17 I was lying on the ground with a sharp pain in my midsection. My ears were ringing from the force my head had hit the grass with, despite the helmet, and it was hard to even breath at the moment. It was the last practice before our Championship game, and we were only wearing shoulder pads and helmets instead of full gear, and we most definitely were not supposed to be hitting each other this hard. “Jones, what the fuck is wrong with you?” Coach Cole snarled as he reached me and knelt down. Davey stood over me, probably glaring daggers at me like he’d done every time we’d seen each other for the last few months. Part of me had hoped he’d not play after all, and another part wanted to quit the team, but he was there and I wouldn’t quit just because of him. “Sorry coach.” Davey said around his mouth guard before turning and walking away. “You okay, Breckenridge?” Coach asked as he helped me sit up. “Just got the breath knocked out of me.” I said weakly. “What is it between you two?” Cole asked me with real concern. “Last semester you two couldn’t be pried apart with a crowbar.” “Yeah, well, things change.” I said as I got to my feet. Coach had to support me as I limped to the sidelines and Brandon went in to take my place. Two hours later I was pulling into the driveway of Davey’s house. I hadn’t been there since that day he’d ended our relationship to keep his mother from figuring out he was gay. If I had any choice, I wouldn’t be here now. “Yes?” The Housekeeper, a middle-aged Mexican woman asked when I rang the doorbell. “I’m Brian, Brenda’s son.” I said holding the box Mom had asked me to pick up at the airport. “Oh yes, come in.” The woman said with a slight smile. “She’s in the office. I’ll show you the way.” “I know it.” I said grimly. It felt weird being in here, like I was an interloper. At least Davey wasn’t here. Neither was my mother, I discovered as I entered the room that had once been President Jones’s study. Davey’s mother was in there alone, doing some paperwork. “Brian!” She exclaimed with a smile as I entered. “Good, you got it. Why don’t you put it over there on the table?” “Sure, Mrs. Jones.” I said softly as she pointed to a side table. I put the box down, wiping my hands on my jeans and turned, preparing to leave. “How have you been, Brian?” She asked me before I could escape. “I’ve been well, ma’am.” I said simply, hoping she’d let it go at that. “I haven’t seen you in ages.” She said and I realized I was in for the full questioning. “I’ve been busy.” I said softly. “That’s what Davey’s said.” She stated with a frown. “He’s been miserable, you know. He won’t tell me what caused you boys to fight.” “It’s a guy thing.” I said quickly and she frowned. “I haven’t seen that Sean boy around here much, either.” She said. “Did that have something to do with it? I thought it was agreed it would be okay if he came over as long as he didn’t… do anything.” “He isn’t comfortable over here.” I said, hoping this was a way to get her to let me go. “I think he knows he’s not really wanted over here and he’s nice enough to not push himself where he’s not wanted.” “I see.” She said with a deeper frown. “You know that had nothing to do with you, right? I’d hate to think that Davey’s best friend abandoned him because of something his mother said.” “I…uh…” I stammered, not able to find anything to say that wasn’t a lie or too close to the truth. “You know that Davey does miss you, don’t you?” She asked. “I mean, he’s been doing poorly in school without someone to study with, and all those girls he’s been dating haven’t done much to help him concentrate on his books. I’m starting to worry he might not be able to get into a good school if he keeps this up.” “With all due respect, that’s his problem.” I said a little more forcefully than I should have. Davey had dumped Julie two weeks into the school year, and was now dating Heather, one of the cheerleaders running for Homecoming Queen. Davey was rumored to be the favorite for King this year. “Why are you so angry with him, then?” She asked directly. “After everything he went through where you supported him, I can’t understand why you would turn your back on him when he’s finally getting his life put together.” “Maybe because I disagree with how he’s going about doing that.” I said with a shrug. It was time this conversation ended. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some more errands to run. It was nice seeing you again.” “Don’t be such a stranger, Brian.” She murmured as I left the room. Unfortunately I didn’t make it out of the house in time, because Davey was walking in with Riley from the football team, and both Heather and Riley’s girlfriend, Marsha were following behind. “Oh, hi.” Davey said as he saw me in the entranceway. “I was just leaving.” I said shortly and moved to push my way through them, garnering a glare from Riley and a look of confusion between the two girls. “What is it with him?” I heard Heather ask from behind. “Brian, wait!” Davey called out before I’d gone three steps to my car. He said something under his breath to the others and shut the door behind him as he caught up with me. “I’m sorry about the hit today. It was wrong of me.” “Apology accepted.” I said simply, not looking at him. “Is that all you have to say?” He asked in a hurt tone. “What else is there to say?” I asked him. “You made it quite clear already. You don’t want to risk your mom knowing about what used to be between us, I don’t want to live a lie, watching you make out with some girl all the time.” “It doesn’t have to be this way.” Davey said in a hurt voice. “I miss you.” “You’re right, it doesn’t have to be this way.” I said turning around to look at him. He looked shocked by the anger in my eyes. “You chose your path, I chose mine.” “Are you and Todd really going out or is it just to make me jealous?” He asked. “We’re planning on going to Arizona State together.” I said with a shrug. “Why?” He asked with a frown. “You remember my plan for the future?” I asked him and he nodded. “Well after the incident at the mall, I decided I could trust him and I told him everything. He’s going to help me, and that’s why we’re going to Arizona State. It’s part of the plan.” “I was going to help you…” Davey’s voice drifted off and his hurt look deepened. “You know, this is just until after high school, or maybe after college, once I don’t need Mom’s support anymore. We can get back together then.” “Have you fucked any of those girls yet?” I asked him pointedly and he blanched. “Have you fucked Todd yet?” He demanded of me. “No, we’re good friends, not lovers.” I replied. “Todd wants more, and who knows, maybe after you’re out of my life once and for all, I might like him that way, but for now, no.” “I haven’t had sex with any of the girls.” Davey said softly and there were tears in his eyes. “That’s why I keep breaking up with them. They want to go further than I’m willing.” “Just how far are you willing to go with them?” I snapped, not really wanting to know the answer. “Julie’s the only one to get so far as her hands down my pants.” Davey said defiantly, as if daring me to disbelieve him. “Why not?” I asked him. “Do you really have to ask that?” His voice quaked slightly. “Yes.” I answered. “Because I’m still in love with you and I don’t want anyone but you!” He nearly shouted, and then looked horrified at how loud he’d reacted. With fear, he looked around and only relaxed slightly when he realized no one was around. When he turned back to me, he looked slightly ashamed, but also determined to say something. “Why? Brian, why did you react like this?” “If you love someone you don’t dictate to them.” I said softly. “When you decided this was what you wanted, you were dictating to me the terms of our relationship. I’m not stupid enough to let you turn our relationship into a one-way street.” “I didn’t… that’s not what I wanted to do!” He protested. “It’s what you did.” I replied. “If you wanted to make it a one-way street, well two can play that game, Davey. I love you, I love you a lot, but that love does not give you the right to treat me like a doormat.” “You still love me?” He asked with a look of hope. “I will love you until the day I die, and probably even beyond that if there’s a way.” I said to him with all my heart. “But you’re still not going to take me back?” He asked. “Not like this, no.” I said. “I’m sorry Davey, I’d be willing to come up with something to work around your fears with your parents, but I won’t be dictated to, and that’s what you wanted.” “So, if I said it differently we could still work things out?” He asked hopefully. “Not at this point.” I said with a sad shake of my head. “Maybe back when this all began. No, don’t say anything. I made a couple of mistakes too, like that trip to the mall. It takes two to tango, and we were both ready to dance. But, now we’ve made our beds, separately, and we’ll have to live with them.” “I don’t want a life without you.” He said miserably. “But you put your mother and family as being more important.” I said simply. “I understand that, Davey, I really do. They mean more to you than anything else, including your own life. That’s fine, really, if you want to live your life as a slave to their expectations, their goals, and their desires, that’s your prerogative. Just don’t expect me to go along for the ride.” “I…” He started to say before he fell silent. “Goodbye, Davey.” I said before turning and heading back to my car. It had a feeling of finality to it, and my eyes were clouded with tears by the time I pulled out of the driveway and headed home. When I saw Todd’s car already there waiting for me, it was actually a relief, and he followed me inside the empty house without bothering to say a word. He’d seen the look on my face, and knew I’d spend the next thirty minutes with his arms wrapped around me while I soaked his shirt with more tears. It had happened often enough, and we didn’t even bother going further in the house than the entryway before I bent over and cried into his shoulder. He was a lot shorter than me, which meant that by the time I was done, my neck and back was sore, but I was grateful. When his lips locked on mine as I tried to straighten up, I was caught totally by surprise. Sure, I knew he still carried a torch for me, but he’d never tried this before. Still, there was something in that touch, that kiss that lit a fire inside me. I had been without this since Davey and I had… broken up, and it felt good as we kissed. Not nearly as good as Davey, but still… “No.” I said as I finally broke away from the kiss. “No, what?” Davey’s harsh voice surprised me and I turned to see him standing inside the doorway, a look of anger and pain on his face. “Oh shit.” Todd said softly, moving out of my embrace even as I stepped back as well. “So, I thought you said the two of you weren’t more than friends.” Davey snarled at me as anger totally replaced the look of hurt. “It’s nice to know I can be as stupid as my mother when it comes to believing the men I love.” “Davey, it’s not like that.” Todd said before I could even think of a single thing to say. “I kissed him. It was the first time!” “How was it?” Davey snarled his question at me as he clenched and unclenched his fists. “Not the same.” I said with a sad look at him. “I’m sorry Todd, but I don’t love you.” “It was worth a try.” Todd said with a shrug. “But then, I didn’t expect to get caught by him.” “Of course you didn’t.” Davey sneered. “Why should I come over here anymore? Tell me Todd, how much of this has been your idea?” “Davey, stop that.” I said sharply. “We’ve got enough problems between us that you don’t need to make new ones.” “Yeah, well I was coming over to see if that offer of always having a place to stay here still stood, but I don’t know now.” Davey snarled again. “I don’t know if I can stand to see all of our friends trying to get down your pants.” “Like you expected me to stand around and watch all those girls do the same to you?” I snapped back at him before the import of his words hit me. “What do you mean if you could stay here?” “Mom’s kicked me out.” Davey snapped with a look of hurt. “Why would she do that?” Todd asked with a perplexed look. “Because I’m a fucking pervert as bad as my father.” Davey snarled angrily, but there were tears in his eyes. “What happened?” I asked with real concern as my anger washed away in the blink of an eye. I took a step towards him, and he responded by stepping towards me before he fell into my arms, crying on my shoulders. It was a long time before he could make any sounds that were intelligible. Todd helped me guide Davey towards a couch, and got a box of tissues for Davey to blow his nose once he calmed down. “She confronted me after you left.” Davey said softly as he clutched my hand. We were now sitting side-by-side with Todd in a chair across from us. “About what?” “About you, about me, about what I did to keep you away.” Davey said sadly. His shoulders shook a bit more, and his voice was quivering. “She kept harping on me in front of Riley and Heather and Jennifer. I snapped. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told her, right there in front of everyone.”",

      "content": "“You what?” Todd gasped in shock while I blinked. Yes, trust Davey to let his anger get the best of him and tell everything, or nearly everything. “I told her.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “I told her that Brian and me had been a couple, as in lovers, that we loved each other. Then I told her that after I heard her talk about Sean that way that I knew she’d never accept us, so I broke things off and started dating girls to make her happy, but that I’d never sleep with any of them because I loved Brian.” “Holy shit.” Todd said with a hint of respect in his voice. “What happened then?” “Heather slapped me.” Davey chuckled but he was on the verge of tears still and he squeezed my hand tightly. “Riley just shook his head and the three of them left before my mom started to tear into me. You know, she has no problem believing I’m a ‘fucking pervert’, but she says I seduced Brian, turned him into a pervert and she’s going to warn Brenda to keep me away from him. Then she kicked me out. Told me to pack my car with stuff and get the fuck out of there. Last I heard, she was on the phone to Nanny and Papa after she called Dad and blamed him for perverting their son.” “Jesus fucking Christ.” Todd muttered while I pulled Davey into me closer. “I’m so sorry, Davey.” I said softly. “It’s not your fault.” Davey said with a sigh. “I don’t know why I thought pretending would fix anything. All it did was make her madder when she found out. I think that’s what she’s so angry about, not that I’m gay so much as the fact that I lied about it to her all this time. Imagine if it had been years and years of my lying to her before she found out.” “Oh believe me, it would have been bad.” I chuckled softly. “The other me tell you about that?” Davey asked and then he looked at Todd for a moment. “You said you told him, right?” “That he’s some weird kind of time-traveler and really a perverted old man in a young body?” Todd asked rhetorically. “Yeah, he told me. I told him he was wasting his second youth. He should be out there screwing everything in sight that he knew would bend over instead of pining after… oh, um, sorry.” “I… I thought the same thing at first.” Davey said with a blush. “Sometimes I wonder if he’d have been better off without me in his life.” “No, never that.” I said with a shudder as I remembered Davey telling me about that life in another timeline. “So, my other self, he told you about her finding out one time?” Davey asked with a little half-smile. “I can tell you later.” I said. “Is it funny?” He asked. “Yes.” I answered. “C’mon Davey, you know your life. Do you think the story would be anything but funny?” “I need to hear it, please?” Davey asked in a needy voice and I had to sigh before giving in to him. I should still be angry at him, part of me said, but I loved him. “It was in the original timeline.” I began to tell him a story of an alternate version of his life. “You’d joined the Navy after dropping out of Downey. Three years later you were in the Gulf War.” “Gulf war?” Todd asked. “Yeah, in 1990 Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq invades Kuwait and we not only stop him there, but kick his ass back to Baghdad.” I answered. “So anyway, on the way back, this ship you were assigned to stopped in Hawaii. You flew your boyfriend, Keith, out to see you there, planning to spend a whole week on that tropical island with him.” “Sounds fun.” Todd murmured a little jealously. “How’d I afford that?” Davey asked. “You saved up a lot of money for him.” I answered with a shrug. “Anyway, two weeks before you pull into Hawaii, you call your mother from Hong Kong. Somehow her and Jenny scraped up enough money to go to Hawaii at the same time you were going to be there.” “They didn’t know at the time, did they?” Davey asked and I grinned. “That sucks.” Todd groaned. “Vacation ruined.” “Yup.” I chuckled. “You spent the week trying to find time to have sex with your boyfriend you haven’t seen in six months. Your sister kept trying to trip him into her bed, and your mom wanted to spend every minute she could with you. Needless to say it was a very frustrating week for everyone. After it was over, you went back to San Diego where you were stationed, and you lived with him.” “That must have been nice.” Davey said wistfully as he relaxed against me. It felt so natural for us to be like this. “I’m sure it was.” I murmured. “Anyway, you were planning this big birthday party for your sister. Your family was all going to come down, and you hired caterers and everything. You told me you got a second job as a bouncer at a bar in order to get enough money to do all this. Then, the night before your sister and mother were to fly down, your mother called. There was another roommate you shared the apartment with besides your boyfriend, and his boyfriend answered the phone. When he told your mom you were at work, she asked for and got the number.” “This doesn’t sound good.” Todd added. “Nope.” Davey agreed, but he was smiling. “Anyway, your mom called the bar, and got the answering machine.” I continued the story. “It said: Hi, you’ve reached Rich’s, the biggest Gay Bar in San Diego…” “Hah!” Todd started laughing while Davey shook his head. “What did she do?” Davey asked. “She left a message.” I chuckled. “She said ‘Tell David Jones Jr. to call his mother this instant!’ It was an hour before he got the message and he rushed to a payphone to call her. The first words out of her mouth were “Are you fucking Keith?” “No, he’s fucking me.” Davey muttered the punch line of his own story from a time he never knew, shocking me. “Well, that’s what I would say.” “That’s what you did say.” I laughed softly and Todd shook his head. “It was months before the two of you ever talked again, but she called Keith each and every night for two weeks.” “I wonder what ever happened to him?” Davey asked. “If I loved him, why wasn’t he around later when…” “I asked about that.” I admitted. “He… he was partying with some guys and flew off to San Francisco with one of them who was really rich, and that was the last that Davey ever saw of him. Two months later, you moved back home with your mother to go back to college. Keith had taken all the money you’d saved up, and you didn’t have enough for rent, and by that time you were out of the Navy.” “That sucks.” Todd shook his head. “I hope I end up with someone like Brian. He’d never do something like that.” “But I would, I did.” Davey said glumly. “Davey, there’s always a room here for you.” I said softly. “I don’t care if we’re talking or not, boyfriends or not, there is always a place here for you. My parents would kill me if I didn’t support that.” “They’re probably as pissed at me as you are.” Davey said miserably. “I certainly hope so.” I said with a laugh and he looked at me like I was insane. “Doofus.” Todd said to him. “You don’t get it, do you? Brian’s saying he’s forgiven you.” “You are?” Davey asked me and I nodded after a moment. “Why?” “Because I love you, and, well, you came right to me after your mother kicked you out.” I said with a shrug. “You got kicked out because you told the truth about you and me, and the only reason to tell the truth would be because you want us to be back together.” “You figured all that out, eh?” Davey asked with a shake of his head. “Yeah, I did.” I acknowledged. “So where do we go now?” Davey asked. “Shit, Heather! It’s going to be all over the school now.” “You never do anything halfway.” Todd said with a grin. “It’s all or nothing with you.” “Shut up.” Davey growled. “My god, we can’t go to school tomorrow! It’s Homecoming!” “We will go, and I’ll be right there with you.” I assured him. “Me too.” Todd added. “Oh, don’t glare at me like that, Davey. I like Brian a lot, maybe too much, but I know a lost cause when I see one. Without you in the picture I might have a chance, but if there’s even a hope of him being with you, he’ll never look at me as more than a friend.” “Damn right about that.” I growled. “Okay, fine, but I’ll be watching you, Todd.” Davey glared at his friend. “Davey, Brian, are you in here?” Mom’s voice announced her arrival, and her worried tone said she’d spoken with Sandy already. “We’re in here!” I half-yelled and she entered the room, stopping as soon as she saw Davey in my arms. “Well, that’s at least one problem solved.” She said and then she looked at Todd with an inquiring look. “I’m pissed that Brian’s not on the market anymore.” Todd said to her with a shrug, which was a little brave of him. He smiled when my mother shook her head at him. “Brian, dear, do you have any boy friends who are actually straight?” Mom asked me with mock exasperation. “Not that I can name off the top of my head, no.” I laughed. “How are you holding up, dear?” Mom asked Davey as she reached the couch and put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m better now than I have been in a long time.” Davey answered with a relieved sound. “I hate to have to ask this but…” “We’ll get your room ready for you later tonight.” Mom said. “Sandy’s still in the yelling mood and won’t listen. I’m going to pick up Bev in the morning and we’re going to tag-team her. You won’t have to stay here for more than a day or two.” “I’m sorry, Mrs. B.” Davey said softly. “It’s Brian you need to apologize to, and those poor girls.” Mom answered him. “The girls?” Davey asked with confusion. “Yes, dear, those girls.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “You’re a smart enough young man to figure out why.” “I used them.” Davey said after a moment. “I led them on, made them believe that more was possible than there really was.” “Yes, dear, you did.” Mom’s tone made her feelings about that crystal clear. “This is not going to be fun.” Davey said with a heavy sigh, causing Mom to chuckle a bit. “Well at least things are back on the right track.” She said with a light tone before looking over at Todd. “You going to stay for dinner?” “I better be getting home.” He said a little reluctantly. “I’ll see you two at school. This is going to be fun.” “God I hope not.” Davey said miserably, but there was a little smile on his face as Todd left the house. “Brian, your father should be home in time for dinner so we’ll fill him in on the day’s events then.” Mom said. “Why don’t you help Davey unload his car? It looks like it’s filled.” “Okay mom.” I said. Davey and I got up then and started to unload his car. He’d packed it mostly with clothes, and a few other odds and ends, which made quite a pile on the bed in the guest room. We were taking in the last load when Dad’s car pulled up in the driveway. Davey and I paused as he got out of his car and looked at the two of us. “Well, this is a surprise.” He said after a moment. “A pleasant one at that. I take it Davey’s finally come to his senses?” “You might say that, and my Mom doesn’t want me around at the moment.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Well, why don’t we all head inside and you can fill me in on the details?” Dad said in a kindly tone that seemed to relax Davey a bit. We finished telling the story over dinner, and Dad was just reiterating his support for Davey when there was a banging on the front door. “That would probably be Pete.” Dad said with a wry chuckle as he got up. Sure enough, it was Davey’s grandfather who stormed in the house, glaring at Davey who was looking a little sheepish. “What kind of tomfoolery are you getting yourself into now, boy?” Pete demanded angrily. “Your mother tells me you’ve gone and decided to be a pervert. You know your soul will burn in hell?” “That’s enough of that, Pete.” Mom said sternly. “Don’t give me no lip, Brenda.” Pete half-snarled. “You don’t know the bible. It says…” “Judge not lest ye be judged.” Mom interrupted him, and for the next twenty minutes I learned something about my mother that I had never known before. She held her own against Pete, quoting a bible verse to counter every one he threw at her. Halfway through Pete relaxed from the angry stance he’d had to something more like his normal self. Finally, he just grunted at her. “Well, we’ll know which of us is right on Judgment Day.” He said flatly before turning back to Davey. “You know I don’t approve of this no matter what she says.” “I know.” Davey said in a firm voice. “I don’t tell you how to live your life, though, Papa.” “Damn right you don’t.” Pete groused and then he nodded. “Fine, you’re going to do what you want to do. Just don’t make me ashamed to be related to you.” “I won’t.” Davey said sternly and Pete nodded before turning to leave without saying another word. “I have no idea what that means.” Davey admitted as the door closed behind his grandfather. “It’s a start.” Mom said softly. “Don’t worry Davey. Your family will come around given time. If he didn’t care, he’d not have come here, and he’d not have stayed as long as he did, or left like that.” “I hope you’re right, Mom B.” Davey said with a heavy sigh as he leaned against me. “She is.” I assured him. Chapter 18 I remembered the last timeline quite clearly, and the reactions of Davey’s family to his sexuality. An older, wiser Davey had years and years to prepare them in subtle ways. Sometimes I think he did it almost without even thinking or planning it, just presented his family with ‘learning experiences’ that nudged them in the right direction. Unfortunately, he had none of that in this timeline. He didn’t have the experience of his first disastrous coming out, nor the memories of years of arguments and discussions that had finally led to grudging acceptance. Nor did he have the years of preparation based on those memories. Instead, he just had me, my parents, and his Aunt Bev. As it turns out, Aunt Bev was all he needed anyway. The woman was a force of nature with an indomitable will. According to her family, she’d always been strong-willed, but recovering from the accident that had left her paralyzed from the neck down had transformed her from merely strong-willed to something else, something more. She might not be able to get out of her wheelchair without someone lifting her, but she was more than capable of lifting anyone by the figurative neck and slapping them around verbally until they saw things her way. The first person she set her sights on that night of Davey’s ‘coming out’, was Davey. She grilled him for nearly an hour over the phone, and at times he was angry, blushing from embarrassment, or silent as she let him know what she thought. The second person to benefit from her opinion was me. That conversation was far shorter, and after a few questions that started with “When did you know you were homosexual?”, most of the conversation was her warning me to not hurt her Davey. “I really don’t want to go to school today.” Davey said early the next morning when I went to his room to wake him up for an early morning run. “I think I’m going to be sick.” “Your stomach is all tied up in knots.” I stated flatly and he nodded with a miserable look on his face. “I feel like I’m going to puke.” He really did sound miserable. “You always feel this way when things are like this.” I said with a shrug. “You told me that it just got worse as time went by and you had to learn to ignore it, to just move forward despite the yuckiness. You told me that if you hadn’t learned to do that, you’d have never succeeded in making anything better in your life.” “I hate that me.” He said with a shake of his head before climbing out of bed and stumbling around to get a pair of sweats on. “I bet that me liked getting up early too.” “No, he hated it with a passion.” I laughed. “Good, at least he didn’t go totally crazy.” Davey sighed. “Let’s get the show on the road.” After stretching out, we jogged at an easy pace for two miles. He actually managed a smile on his face when Mom served us breakfast, and we headed out the door a little early for school. Today we both went in my car, and we pulled into the parking lot nearly a half-hour early. “Oh shit.” Davey mumbled as we got out of the car and saw Heather and Riley standing nearby. Heather had a very determined look on her face while Riley looked uncomfortable. His girlfriend was nowhere to be seen, which I couldn’t decide if that was good or bad. As they walked towards us, I watched Davey take in a deep breath before letting it out slowly. “Well?” Heather said in a stern voice as she crossed her arms and stopped just a foot away from Davey. “I’m sorry.” Davey blurted out and managed to look surprised at his own words. Heather cocked her head to the side and raised an eyebrow but otherwise remained silent, obviously waiting for more. “I’m sorry for misleading you, Heather. You’re a good person. Bright, funny, and very beautiful and you deserve to be treated better than I treated you.” “Oh, I don’t know.” Heather said sarcastically. “You treated me pretty good except for the whole making me think you were interested in me thing.” “I do like you, as a friend.” Davey said defensively. “I almost… I almost wish things were different so I could really be interested in you that way, but I’m not and it was wrong of me to lead you on.” “So you really are queer?” Riley said in a neutral tone and then he looked at me with a very direct look. “You and him both.” “Yes.” Davey said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. “Why?” Heather asked. “Why what?” Davey responded. “Why did you go out with me, and the others as well if you knew you were queer and obviously have nothing against it.” Heather asked. “It was my mother.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and he put everything on the table, although he didn’t mention Sean’s name. While he left that out, he told just about everything else in about fifteen minutes. People walked by us while he talked, but something about how we were standing kept them from approaching, even Brandon and Trevor who arrived just before Davey finished. “I accept your apology.” Heather said when he was done while Riley stood there shaking his head. “I don’t quite understand why you’re queer and don’t have a problem with it, but at least you’re man enough to stand up for yourself. I won’t say anything to anybody, on one condition.” “What’s that?” Davey asked. “Homecoming is tonight.” Heather said with a steely gaze. “We made plans.” “I know.” Davey said softly. “Good.” She said firmly. “You’re going to carry through with them. After tonight, you and I will break up, but for the rest of today we’re still a couple. Anyone have any problems with that?” “No.” Davey and I said in unison while Riley shook his head. “What about you, Riley?” Heather asked. “You got any problems keeping quiet about this stuff if Davey follows through with tonight?” “I don’t understand this whole queer thing, but I’ll keep my mouth shut as long as you don’t try anything with me.” Riley said quietly. “Good, now Davey, put your arm around me and walk me to class.” Heather commanded with a questioningly look at me. I just smiled and waited for them to move off. When they were gone, Riley stayed put, giving me a searching gaze. “You know, I’d have never thought you were a queer.” He said with a disbelieving shake of his head. “Then again, after that shit you went through with Marcie, I might have given up on girls altogether too.” “Yeah, well, it’s a little more complicated than that.” I said with a shrug. “You going to be okay?” “Yeah, I’ll be fine.” He said before walking off. As soon as he was gone, I was swarmed by Trevor and Brandon, who had hooked up with Sean and Todd. Everyone wanted to know what was going on, and when they heard that it sounded like we weren’t going to be outed to the entire school, they all looked a little relieved. As expected, Heather won Homecoming Queen, and Davey was King. She seemed to be very happy with the day’s events, and the fact that we won the game that night made it even better. What was best of all was the fact that she kept her promise, as did Riley (and his girlfriend). There was no public outing for us at Downey that year, although there were whispers and by the time baseball season rolled around, we were pretty sure everyone guessed that Davey and I were a couple. No one brought it out in the open though, and as long as we didn’t do anything too public, it seemed like people were fine with leaving it as just a rumor. I heard a few rumors about Sean and Brandon towards the end of the year, and even I was surprised about Todd and Trevor. The two of them somehow became thick as thieves, and by the time of Davey’s eighteenth birthday it was readily apparent they were a couple. Davey’s family more than made up for the lack of drama at school. Frantic middle-of-the-night calls from an angry Sandy woke all of us up several times until Mom took the phone off the hook. In November, Davey’s father stepped into the mix, at Sandy’s request, and the fireworks really exploded between father and son. We all did what we could to support Davey, but he would fluctuate between being overly happy and depressed. It was after Thanksgiving that things really came to a head. Both of Davey’s parents insisted that he get ‘counseling’ at a local church. Davey kept refusing, and his parents pulled the law into the fight. They reported him as a runaway, and we got a visit from the local police department one night. Legally there was nothing we could do immediately, and Davey left with the two officers who took him back to his mother’s house where his parents were waiting with the pastor of the church offering counseling for ‘troubled youth’. The next morning, both Mom and Beverly ‘quit’ working for Sandy. Dad, at my urging, called the local Social Services department and a figure familiar to me made a visit to Davey’s home, just in time to see the action. After Davey had rudely rebuffed the efforts of the pastor the night before, the man had convinced Sandy to order Davey committed for ‘treatment’ as a ‘rebellious, out of control teenager’. They made up all sorts of things about drug and alcohol abuse, that might have been true two years ago, but were not true now. Mary Lou Hacker walked in just as three burly men were attempting to subdue Davey and get him into a van that would take him to the ‘treatment center’ in another state. Sean, having been subjected to a similar treatment by his own parents had done more than enough to warn Davey, who fought as hard as he could. Mary Lou, hearing screaming and shouting, had entered the house and immediately called the police to come and sort things out. It was Pete who entered the scene and ended the chaos of that day. Sandy had called her mother in tears and the two of them had driven over immediately. By this time the police had arrived and Mary Lou was trying to figure out exactly what was going on there. Pete walked into the house while Monta went right to Sandy who was crying. Mary Lou, a shrewd judge of people, immediately focused on him. “Who are you?” She asked Pete. “I’m Sandy’s father.” Pete said gruffly as he eyed the woman. “Who are you?” “I’m Mary Lou Hacker, with Social Services.” She said and then quickly explained how she’d gotten involved. “Those idiots.” Pete grumbled at once, giving a glance over to where Sandy and David Sr. were sitting. Davey’s father looked offended, but stayed silent. “If the boy’s a queer, he’s a queer. Trying to beat it out of him ain’t gonna do no good.” “What do you mean?” Mary Lou asked him sharply. “The complaint is that he’s been rebellious, drinking, using drugs, and running away from home.” “Hah!” Pete laughed. “Sandy told the boy to get the hell out of her house when he told her he was a queer and he’s been staying with some good people since then. Hellfire, one of them works for Sandy!” “Not no more she doesn’t.” Sandy interjected at that point with an angry tone. “Your loss, girl.” Pete told her with no sympathy. “I’ll admit Davey had a little spell with drugs and alcohol a couple of years back and I was mighty worried about him, but since he met up with this new group of friends he’s finally gotten his life put back together, even if he’s decided he’s a queer. Hell, I can live with him being a queer if it means he ain’t going to piss his life away. There’s worse things in this world than fudgepackers.” That last he said with a glare at Davey’s father. “You’re saying he’s not a runaway?” Mary Lou asked Pete. “That’s what I said, lady.” Pete grumbled, hating to have to repeat himself. “As far as you know he hasn’t been using alcohol or drugs?” She pushed further. “Well, I know he’s had a beer when we go fishing, but just one.” Pete admitted gruffly. “Once in a while we’ll have some wine with dinner at Brian’s.” Davey added, gambling that honesty would win him more points rather than get him in trouble. “That’s definitely not alcohol abuse.” Mary Lou said with a sigh. “Now, what’s this about him being gay?” “I am gay.” Davey said sharply. “They don’t like that and they’ve been insisting I see this Christian counselor. They made up all the other shit so they could commit me the same as Sean’s parents did to him.” “Sean Rule?” Mary Lou asked with a sharp look at Davey. “Do you know him?” “He’s a friend of mine.” Davey said simply and she nodded. “The boy is lying.” The Pastor of First Baptist broke in at that point but he got a stony stare from Mary Lou in response and eventually closed his mouth. “Mr. Barrow, in your opinion is there any need for Davey to be committed?” Mary Lou asked his grandfather. “Hell no.” Pete said firmly. “Do you think you might be able to take him in while his case is reviewed by Social Services and he’s seen by a professional?” She asked. “Wait a minute!” Sandy exploded. “There’s no need for that.” Pete shook his head. “The boy has himself some good people to stay with where he has his own bedroom, which he wouldn’t have at my place. What’s more, he’s got money in a trust fund that Sandy set up, and she named me as the trustee on it so she can’t cut him off.” Sandy didn’t even bother trying to protest against her father. She just started crying again. Mary Lou took all that in, before nodding and suggesting that Pete call these ‘people’ so she could talk to them. An hour later, Davey was back at home, and I was holding him while he cried. We were all lucky that day. Somehow it stayed out of the local papers, and outside of the families involved, no one seemed to know what happened (except for our friends, of course). Davey was less than two months away from his eighteenth birthday, and so he got a lot of leeway that Social Services wouldn’t have been able to give him otherwise. It was the week before Christmas before Davey spoke to his parents again. Bev and Pete had harangued everyone until they had all agreed to apologize to Davey. What’s more, Bev had talked them into family counseling, with a counselor recommended by Mary Lou. By the end of the school year, they had all changed in some surprising ways. In February, Davey moved back in with his mother, at the same time that his father was invited to move into the home. Jenny had been the one to make the final call on that decision, and while she would forever be affected by what had happened to her, the family counseling had done a lot to heal her of the worst affects. She was a lot closer to the young woman I remembered her being than when I first had arrived in this timeline. High School Graduation came around far sooner than I had ever imagined possible. Davey and I celebrated together, along with our friends at a private party. The next day we spent a lot of time saying goodbye to our families in the typical teary-eyed farewells that happen when kids finally grow up and set off on their own. It was my father who drove us to San Francisco where we boarded a plane that took us on a two-hour flight. Todd, Sean, Brandon, and Trevor would all be following us to the same school, but they weren’t coming until later. Davey had insisted we share everything with them, and all of them had demanded they wanted to be a part of our plans. Trevor had turned down the USC scholarship and instead gotten one for ASU. Sean had qualified for several academic scholarships, as did Todd. Davey’s father, who was becoming more like the man I’d known as time passed and he mellowed out, was overjoyed that his son would be going to Arizona State University. The man had been born and raised in Phoenix, and was already planning a trip out to visit. Luckily he wasn’t planning on staying with us. With all of us pitching in together, we were more than able to afford an off-campus house. Truth be told, Davey and I could have afforded it by ourselves, but with all the others coming, there was no reason not to share. Together we leased a four-bedroom home that was six blocks from campus, and Davey’s mother had helped us furnish it. Her business had nearly collapsed when Mom and Bev quit, and I think at least some of the reconciliation with Davey had been to get those two women back to work with her. She’d been lonely without their company, and although she hated to admit it, she needed them far more than they needed the work. “Jesus it’s hot!” Davey murmured as we walked out of the air-conditioned baggage claim area. The heat hit us like a brick wall, and both of us immediately started sweating. I’d been to Phoenix a few times in the last timeline, mostly to visit Trevor and his family, but I’d never gotten use to this heat. “Just wait.” I mumbled. “It gets worse.” “Why the hell are we going to school here instead of somewhere colder?” Davey muttered as we hailed a taxi. Instead of answering I just gave him a withering glare and he had the grace to shrug off his own question. Fifteen minutes later we were at our new house, a fairly nice two-story home, and we unloaded our bags in the room that would be ours. “I bet our air-conditioning bills are going to be horrible.” Davey complained as the air conditioner brought the house down to a reasonable temperature. “Just during the summer, and it’ll only be the two of us most summers.” I reminded him. “Do you really think I can cram in enough classes to graduate in three years?” He asked me with a worried look. “If we both study hard, we can.” I assured him. “It will mean that we won’t be able to party as much as everyone else.” “You mean we won’t have as many opportunities to get in trouble.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “No thanks. With my luck I’d get drunk off my ass and thirty years later someone will come up with pictures of me puking on the sidewalk. I can live without all that shit.” “Glad to hear that.” I said with a smile. “As long as you and I get to fuck like bunnies.” He leered at me. “We’ve got an hour before we have to be on campus.” I reminded him. “You want to break the bed in?” “Let’s.” Davey said with a grin. We made it on-time, barely, to the special orientation the school had set up for the few freshmen who were getting an early start to their college education. It was a Saturday, and we had most of the afternoon to look around the school and surrounding area. On Sunday, we spent several hours on the phone to family and friends back in California, most of whom thought we were crazy for going to summer school. Then on Monday, we started our first day of classes. That summer wasn’t easy on either one of us. We had selected our courses for that first semester with great care. I had been through college before, and could remember what a difference it was from high school. In high school, much of the work was memorization of facts, dates, information, etc. with very little ‘opinion’ thrown in the mix. College was more about the ‘why’ and the ‘how’. That was why our first courses were the introductory political science course necessary for our major (International Relations) and the six-week intensive Russian Language course. ASU had one of the best Russian language courses in the nation, and many of their students were recruited by the U.S. State Department for work in their embassies and other facilities. The NSA also recruited heavily from the school, another reason for why I picked that school for undergraduate work. In many ways, it was better for what we wanted than the bigger-name Ivy League schools with more prestigious programs. After the first summer session, Davey was about ready to tear his hair out, and even I was tired. Still, we signed up for another intensive language course for the second summer session, which would put us a full year ahead in the foreign language requirements. We didn’t take any other course, and so by the time our one-week break between the second summer session and Fall semester arrived, we were both only half-crazy. Trevor showed up by himself several weeks into the second summer session for his football training camp, and complained non-stop about the heat. Davey’s parents, and his sister showed up for that one-week break, and we spent the entire time following his father around to all of his old haunts. The home he’d grown up in was now an apartment complex, but his school was still there. It was odd seeing his parents back as a couple, but both of them seemed happier. His father had used some of his wife’s lottery money to open up a rental car company in Modesto. Instead of focusing on just the rental car market, he also rented larger trucks and multi-purpose vehicles. After just a few months, he was already in negotiations to open franchises in three other towns in California. Jenny talked about going to ASU, but I had a feeling she was really thinking about going somewhere else for college. My parents made it out for the weekend, along with Brandon, Sean, and Todd. It was nice having our friends around again, although the late August thunderstorms put a damper on our sightseeing both Saturday and Sunday. Davey and I knew to do our runs very early in the morning, when the temperature might get down to a cool ninety degrees. Trevor did too, and we all laughed the one time our roommates tried to go running as late as eight in the morning when the temperature was inching into the mid-nineties and above. The first day of the regular semester started early for both Davey and me. Davey had an eight o’clock three-day a week political science course while I had a math course at the same time. Then there was an hour break for us before our five-day a week Russian 201 course. This was an important one, mostly because of the instructor, Professor Lee. The Professor was a tall man with a wild shock of white hair that still had a few streaks of brown in it. We actually had him for two courses, the grammar-focused 201 course, and the culture/speaking focused 211 course. He was also the professor for a two-day a week course on Soviet History that we were taking. It was part of the Soviet Studies Certificate that was highly prized by the U.S. State Department in potential employees. “Brian, and David, please stay after class for a moment.” He told us in Russian towards the end of the 201 course. After the bell rang, we waited and he nodded briefly to us. “I do not normally see freshmen in this course.” “We took the summer course.” Davey replied to the statement in the language it had been spoken in, Russian. His accent was still off, and the phrasing a bit clunky, but it sufficed. “Do you speak?” Professor Lee asked me. “Of course.” I replied, using the word konyechna. He smiled before grilling us for a few minutes to make sure we really did have a decent grasp of the language. “You will do fine.” He said with approval in English. “What other courses are you taking this semester?” “We are in your 211 course.” Davey answered. “And the Soviet History course as well.” I added. “How interesting.” He said in Russian before switching back to English. “Are you going to major in Russian?” “International Relations with the certificate in Soviet Studies”. Davey answered. “I’ll probably take all four years of language though.” “Same with you?” He asked me and I shook my head. “I’m majoring in Economics with a minor in Russian and of course the Soviet Studies.” I answered. He cocked his head. “Interesting choice.” He said. “Why?” “I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think that within five years the Soviet Union will no longer exist.” I stated in English with a shrug. He just blinked. “What gives you that idea?” He asked slowly and carefully, as if speaking to someone he was worried might go crazy at the drop of a hat. “Gorbachev’s reforms are a starting point.” Davey began our argument. He and I had been over this time and again over the last year. Oddly, it was our favorite topic after sex, and we’d spent a lot of time lying in bed, the room smelling like sex, and discussed the end of the Cold War. “He’s playing with fire in a forest that hasn’t seen a drop of rain in seventy years. Sure, he’s dug a fire pit, ringed it with stones, and is trying to clear away any nearby underbrush, but he doesn’t realize that all it’s going to take are a few gusts of wind and a few sparks, and there’s going to be a forest fire so big nothing can stop it from burning down the forest of communism.” “Nice alliteration.” The Professor said with a slight smile. It was a good alliteration. Davey always had a way with words. “I think it will start in the Eastern European Republics.” I added. “Most likely it’ll be Poland that starts the ball rolling. Solidarity is gaining in strength, even if it is still mostly underground and being supported by the CIA and the Catholic Church. From there it’ll probably head to Hungary, and eventually to Germany. That will really be the death knell of communism, if Germany can reunite.” “Hard-line communists in Russia will probably try to stop it from happening, maybe even try to take down Gorbachev.” Davey added. “But, it’ll be too late.” “That’s what we think, at least.” I said with a shrug. “If you think this, why are you studying Russian and the Soviet Union?” The Professor asked. “If you’re right, any careers you might have planned will not really be needed.” “Russia, and the former communist states will need to adjust to a post-communist form of governing.” I said with aplomb. “They’ll need to learn the basics of a capitalist economy, and they’ll want advice. There will be plenty of opportunities for work, and for making money.” “I think I’m going to enjoy having you two in my classes.” He said after shaking his head. “Maybe we’ll find a few holes to poke in your theories. The Soviet Union has been around a long time, and they’ve gone through periods of reform before. I’ll want you to pay close attention to the sections between Lenin and Stalin, and the Khrushchev years.” “Thank you.” I said with a nod of my head while Davey smiled at him. We talked for a few more minutes before heading out for lunch. Todd was shaking his head after his first lessons in Arabic. Sean was babbling about something from his physics class, Trevor talked about football, and Brandon was mostly silent. Of all of us, his courses in Computer Science were the least developed at this school, and he could have done a lot better by going somewhere else, but this was the school that seemed to allow us all the best opportunity to attend as a group. Our first year in school was tiring for all of us. While no one else was taking eighteen units like Davey and I were, we all had a great deal of focus on our studies. Trevor, Brandon, and Todd attended a few parties, and Trevor was offered to pledge one of the fraternities, but he turned them down. Because we were all in fairly steady relationships, we did a lot less partying than most freshmen, and were slower in making new friends. That wasn’t to say we didn’t have new friends. Of all of us, Trevor was in the most delicate situation. He played ASU football, and they were a team that got a lot of attention. There was intense pressure on him to have a girlfriend, but he quietly refused and people quickly began to realize what was up when they always saw him in Todd’s company. One of the coaches even pulled Trevor aside and made a few ‘suggestions’ that Trevor didn’t even pause to consider. “You’ll never be picked up professionally if you don’t at least play that game.” The Coach warned him. Since I remembered Trevor as having fallen in love, gotten married and having kids with a woman, I was surprised by how he stuck with Todd. Not that it was a bad thing. It was just unexpected. “You know, I could dump Todd and date women, maybe even get married.” Trevor said after he’d come back from that meeting with one of the coaches. We were alone in the house, since Davey and the others had all gone out to see a movie. I’d stayed behind to re-work an essay for my English Lit course. Having lived a whole lifetime already didn’t necessarily provide any assistance when it came to writing this damn essay, and Trevor wanting to talk was a good diversion. “Why don’t you?” I asked him. “I know you’ve always dreamed of being in the NFL, and it’ll be next to impossible if you don’t at least appear to be hetero.” “Do you think I should?” He asked me with a raised eyebrow. “Are you happy with Todd?” I asked him. “I mean, you know most high school romances don’t last forever.” “Look at Davey’s parents.” Trevor countered with a shrug. “His mom married his dad right out of high school, and then he went and did all that shit. Now they’re back together and planning their re-marriage during winter break. Look at my parents. They met in college and they’re still together.” “But do you think that you and Todd have what it takes to last that long?” I asked him. “The last timeline, you and Davey lasted that long, didn’t you?” He asked me. “Yes.” I agreed. “Do you think the two of you will last that long again?” He asked. “I mean, for you it’s going to be two lifetimes with the same man. Don’t you get bored?” “No.” I said emphatically. “I could never get bored with Davey.” “I don’t think I could get bored with Todd, either.” Trevor stated. “He’s fun to be with, and we’re constantly doing things together. He loves football, or at least watching it, and we both love music. There are so many things we have in common, and some things we don’t. It’s like we fit together.” “Okay, if it makes you happy, then I say go for it and damn the consequences.” I told him with a smile. “You know, I think that might have had something to do with me coming back in time. I was looking at the end. Davey was probably already dead, and we’d had such good times together that I didn’t want it to end. So I came back to start over again, to have another lifetime with him.” “Kind of selfish, huh?” Trevor said with a smile. “You say you came back to save the world, but you really came back just to be young enough to pork Davey for another sixty years.” “I’ve been caught at last!” I laughed and we both chuckled before he went to find something to do while I went back to that damn essay. Was I really that selfish? Well, maybe I was, but then a part of me believed that Davey had come back over and over again for me, so why shouldn’t I come back for him? Chapter 19 “Remind me why we’re doing this again?” Davey asked with a heavy sigh as we sat down for lunch. It was a little restaurant just off of Indian School Road, and we both were tired, sweaty, and hungry. We managed to get a sneer from the waiter when he saw the t-shirts we were wearing, but he took our order just the same. “Because it’s important to build the right connections from the beginning.” I reminded him as the waiter left. “You know I support the other guy, right?” He leaned in and whispered with a conspiratorial smile. “Even after all the crap that I told you about in other timelines?” I asked him and he frowned before shaking his head. “I don’t believe I’m really a Democrat.” Davey muttered for the fiftieth time. “Wait until 1992.” I assured him and he shook his head again. Sure, Dukakis lost, and he lost big, and here in Arizona he was wildly unpopular, but working on the campaign built up credibility for later. Davey and I weren’t talking in the fall of 1986, so he hadn’t worked with me on the California gubernatorial election, but I’d been there with bells on. “I know, I know.” Davey said with a sigh. Walking precincts was the basic level of work, along with phone banking, and we were doing both for the doomed Dukakis for President campaign. It helped build credibility for things I wanted to happen down the road, and in Arizona, along with a few thousand dollars in contributions from our trust funds, it had gotten us delegate positions to the national Dem convention this year. Todd and Trevor showed up before we ordered, and they both griped at me for talking them into this. Brandon and Sean both were phone banking today, and probably getting nasty comments and hang-ups, just like we were getting doors slammed in our faces. Four years from now it’d be a totally different story, but this was the here and now, and besides we likely wouldn’t be in Arizona then. After lunch, it was back into the one hundred plus degree heat for more precinct walking. Sure, it was late September, but the heat lingered here well into October sometimes. It was days like this one that made me think I’d picked the wrong school. Dinner reaffirmed my having made the right choice, though, as we showed up at Professor Lee’s house. It was a private dinner, with some of his fellow professors, two graduate students, and then Davey and I. While we were technically in our second ‘year’ of attending college, both Davey and I had accumulated enough credits that we were on the border between Sophomore and Junior status. It wasn’t exactly easy going on either of us. Davey had nearly had a mental breakdown over the summer, and so we’d taken a lighter load for the second half of summer. The truth was I needed that lighter class load too. Then, instead of visiting family in Modesto, we’d taken off for Hawaii and spent nearly two weeks there before the fall semester started. We’d returned a little more tanned, and a lot more relaxed. After dinner, we were sitting around Professor Lee’s living room, sipping cognac and discussing some of the finer points of Stalin’s Five-Year Plan when the Professor got around to the purpose of the dinner. It wasn’t the first dinner we’d been to at his house, and we were always the only undergraduates there, although he had thrown a big party at the end of the year for all of his Russian language students. He had these dinners at least once a month, though. The difference was that he’d just hosted one two weeks ago. “Brian, Davey, I hope you remember the discussion we had when you first came to Arizona State about what you see as the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union.” Professor Lee began, and there was actually a few giggles from the graduate students. “Yes, Professor.” I said while Davey cautiously nodded. “You two did a joint report for me last year where you provided some good supporting facts.” Professor Vikten, a wrinkled, bald man in his late sixties added with a nod towards us. “You had quite a lot of interesting facts in there that I have never seen added up quite that way before. It was either a work of genius or sheer stupidity.” That got more giggles, and a few chuckles from the other professors in the room while Davey blushed and I tried not to laugh. Knowing the Soviet Union was going to collapse, and why it did from evidence after its fall was one thing. Trying to find the evidence to point to it beforehand, without talking about time travel, or having access to classified information was even more difficult. Thankfully the library here kept up to date on a lot of periodicals that had the information we needed for the paper. “I hope you thought it was genius because we both got an A on it.” I finally said after getting the urge to laugh under control. This time there was a lot more open laughter. “Yes, whether it was right or wrong, it was well researched and well written.” He praised us, and from him it was high praise. “It was well written enough that it formed the core of a grant request that we submitted over the summer.” Professor Lee added and this time I was surprised. I had not expected that. “The grant has been approved, and we are forming the research group that will work on the grant. All the people here tonight have expertise in the areas we need, and the idea came from the two of you. I took the liberty of submitting your names to the government already, and the preliminary security clearances were approved for both of you, despite, um well I believe we do not need to go into that.” That did surprise me a bit. It wasn’t until Bill Clinton took office that the rules were changed regarding gay people having security clearances. In this time, merely being gay usually classified someone as a security risk and they would not be given any sort of security clearance by the government. Some strings must have been pulled on this, and it showed I had indeed picked the right school. “We’re going to be studying the economic conditions in Eastern Europe with a focus on how it might bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Davey asked in the silence that followed. “Are you sure we can contribute to that?” “You’re both four-oh students, this was your idea to begin with, and your research papers have shown you know how to conduct proper research.” Professor Vikten said bluntly. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you both were graduate students already. You will of course receive a small stipend, not that either of you need it from what I hear, and you will receive course credit for your work, as upper-division credit. Is it correct that you’re both only taking eighteen units this semester?” “Only eighteen?” One of the graduate students gasped. “That’s right.” I confirmed. “It was getting a little bit much for us over the summer so we decided to lighten the load a bit. It’ll mean graduating after summer school in ’91 instead of Spring ’91, but it’s better than having a breakdown.” “Yes, it is.” Vikten agreed. “Do you think you can handle the extra work if you join us on the grant team?” “We can.” Davey said excitedly. I nodded my agreement. “Good, then let’s start talking details.” Professor Lee said as he finished off his drink and started into the details of what the grant covered, and what each person’s role would be. Honestly, it was more than I could have hoped for, although some of the preliminary conclusions would come too late, I knew, at least it’d be on record that we were part of the team predicting the fall of the Soviet Union when it actually collapsed. A problem cropped up the next week though, when two FBI agents interviewed Davey and me separately. In my interview, it quickly became apparent that the agent didn’t like gay people, and didn’t believe either of us should have a security clearance of any type. Most of the information we would have access to was economic in nature, not military, but it still was sensitive information. “You’re a homosexual.” The agent, a middle-aged man in a dark suit said as he sat across from me at a small table. He looked unpleasant in the extreme. “Yes.” I answered simply and honestly. “Homosexuals can’t be trusted with government secrets.” He stated succinctly and started to stand up. “Why not?” I asked him calmly and he looked at me with a little surprise at the challenge to his statement. “You’re too easy to blackmail.” He grunted. “Blackmail?” I laughed softly. “What is there to blackmail me about?” “The communists could threaten to reveal your perversion publicly.” He said sourly. “Hmmm.” I said while tapping my finger on my chin. “Who would they threaten to reveal it to that would scare me? I just told you, an FBI agent, that I was gay. My parents know. My friends know. My professors know, and many students I go to classes with know or at least suspect. They could shout it from the rooftops, take an ad out in the New York Times, or announce it on television for all I care. How can they use it to blackmail me when I don’t care who knows?” “They could seduce you.” He said flatly. “They could seduce anyone.” I pointed out. “It’s a constant threat, isn’t it? That someone with sensitive information will fall into bed with an agent and give up everything they know for love. Sorry, but I already have someone I love. We’re in a relationship together, and we have been for years. I’m not going to risk that for some random romp in the hay no matter how cute the guy might be.” “It’s easy to say that, but reality is different.” He said. “You’re a guy, a guy who sleeps with other guys. Fidelity isn’t in your nature.” “You don’t know me well enough to say that.” I snapped. “You’re married, and you’re a guy. Aren’t you a risk because some pretty woman might try to seduce you? That happens all the time in this country, you know. Married men cheating on their spouses.” “Don’t try to switch this back on me.” He fumed, but he looked like he was at least thinking. “The purpose of an investigation for a security clearance is to determine if the person will be a risk, right?” I asked him in a neutral tone. “It’s your job to find out as much about me as you can to help you decide if I will reveal classified information to people who should not have it.” “Your explanation is a little simplistic.” He said, but he wasn’t hostile. “How thorough have you been?” I asked him with a raised eyebrow. “What about that bitch, Marcie? Do you have that incident in my file?” “Your ex-girlfriend who tried to trap you into marrying her.” He grumbled. “So you’re not really a homosexual, are you?” “More bi-sexual, but I’m in a homosexual relationship and never plan to leave that relationship.” I shrugged. “I don’t get how you can just blabber about being a pervert.” He grumbled. “You know, I could arrest you for violating the sodomy laws here in this state. How can I give someone who is knowingly breaking state law a security clearance?” “Can the FBI arrest me for violating a state law?” I asked him. “Well I can have you arrested by a state trooper.” He corrected. “The Supreme Court just upheld sodomy laws in Texas a few years ago.” “Yes, I know.” I smiled. “Um, have I admitted to having sexual intercourse in violation of the law?” “You’ve said you were a homosexual.” He stated. “But did I admit to any sexual activity while in the state of Arizona?” I pushed. “No.” He frowned. “So you can’t have me arrested for violating state sodomy laws when I haven’t admitted to violating them.” I pointed out. “Just being gay doesn’t mean I have to have sex here in this state. Davey and I could drive across the border to California if we want and it’s perfectly legal there.” “This is getting us nowhere.” He groused. “No it isn’t.” I agreed. “If you believe I’m a security risk, deny me clearance. All I ask is that you base it on a real judgment about me, not because you believe I’m a pervert. Which I disagree with, by the way.” “Fine.” He grumbled. Davey’s interview went much the same as mine, except Davey really tore into his agent who got decidedly uncomfortable at a few things. My lover’s luck was with him as always, and he had been able to guess the man was a closet case. He’d used that mercilessly to rake the poor agent over the coals without flat out saying he was sure the man was a closet case. The next day word came down that we had received our clearances. Normally we would have gone to the game that night and cheered our school’s team on (and Trevor), but Davey and I wanted a private celebration. I cooked a romantic dinner for two, and we ate over a candlelit table. These moments were important for both of us, because they helped keep our relationship as more than simple friendship. Sean hadn’t gone either since he had a class tonight. After dinner, we put the plates in the dishwasher and moved upstairs to our room, the master bedroom for the house. We had moved Davey’s king-size waterbed out here, and on nights like this one, I was glad I’d insisted we get one of the new wave-less water mattresses. We must have spent a good half-hour doing nothing more than kissing and slowly undressing each other, covering each other’s bodies with our hands and our mouths. Making love with Davey was always different. Sometimes it was quick and dirty, and other times, like tonight it was slow and sensual. We’d achieved another victory, overcoming the homophobic prejudices of the FBI agents, and that made our lovemaking all the sweeter. An hour after we’d begun, I was buried deep inside Davey, his legs over my shoulders, and he was leaning up so we could kiss while I fucked him with long, slow strokes. Everything was so perfect, and that was when the door to our bedroom flew open. We were playing Davey’s radio, one of Asia’s albums in case Sean came home after class and so we hadn’t heard the noises of the black-clad officers entering our house. Until they surrounded us with weapons drawn and pointed at us, we didn’t even know they were in the house. “What the fuck?” Davey yelled at the interruption, and I felt a moment of fear. Had the FBI agents set this up so they could try and get a prosecution of us under the state’s sodomy laws? Would the state even bother prosecuting it since it could result in bad publicity. “Uh, you both need to get dressed.” One of the officers in the black swat gear, his face hidden by a ski mask and his helmet, said in a voice that almost sounded like he was on the verge of laughing. “What’s going on here?” I demanded as I pulled out of Davey. Already I’d gone soft, but I made no move to cover myself. I’d be damned if I’d let these motherfuckers think I was ashamed. “You need to come with us, immediately.” The same officer said in a slightly calmer voice. “Are you arresting us?” Davey demanded as he raised himself up on his elbows and glared at them. “On what charge?” “You’re not under arrest.” The agent said as he signaled with his hands for the other men to leave the room. A few of them were snickering, and one was muttering something that sounded a little disgusted, but that was all. “We’re actually here for your protection, by order of the President of the United States.” “What?” Davey exclaimed in surprise while I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I immediately suspected that somehow, our secret had gotten out. With a sigh I nodded at the officer. “Can you give us a moment to get dressed?” I asked him. “I’m not supposed to let either of you out of my sight.” He said with amusement in his voice. “How much time do we have?” I asked him, trying to think quickly. “Could we take a quick shower so we don’t smell wherever we’re going?” “As long as you leave the bathroom door open and don’t take too long.” He said after thinking for a moment. “C’mon Davey.” I said to my lover. “We’ll shower together to save time.” “Okay.” Davey said in a shaky voice as we got off the bed and headed into the bathroom, leaving the door open. As the hot water gave us a little privacy, I leaned in to whisper to him. “I think somehow they know about time travel.” I whispered. “No shit.” Davey murmured. “What else would get us this much attention? The shit in Eastern Europe doesn’t happen for several more months. How could they know and how in hell do they even believe it?” “We’ll probably find out soon enough.” I said. “We don’t have all night.” The officer called from the doorway, and we finished the shower in a hurry. When we were both dry and headed over to the dresser to pull out some underwear, he spoke again. “You might want to dress comfortably and pack a bag or two with some nicer clothes in them. It’s a little cold where you’re going.” “Where are we going?” Davey asked as he slipped on a pair of red bikini briefs I had bought for him. He looked so damn good in them. “Let’s just say back east.” The officer said with a shrug. “There’s a plane flying in to Sky Harbor right now to pick you and the others up at the National Guard hangar.” “Can we leave a note for our roommates?” I asked as I pulled on a pair of white briefs and a t-shirt. Davey was already pulling out white socks, dress socks, extra t-shirts, and our ties. I went over to the closet and pulled out two pairs of jeans, some polo shirts, and two light jackets that we almost never used here in Arizona. We were dressed quickly, and while Davey packed the small clothes in to a duffel bag, I put some dress clothes into a garment bag. “There’s no need for that.” The officer said. “You almost done?” “We’re done.” Davey said as I zipped up the garment bag and folded it over for transport. “Good, you don’t waste any time.” The man said as he waved for us to lead the way out of the room. We moved in a circle of armed men as we left the house and got into several vans marked with ATF and DEA. I noticed a large group of onlookers, mostly fellow college students and wondered what stories would circulate now. Probably how we were drug dealers or something, since it was the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I did notice that several regular Tempe Police officers were standing guard outside the house as we pulled away. Davey and I were in the back of one of the vans, and once inside we could see nothing. We were alone here, and Davey’s hand found mine, squeezing it tightly. “What do we do now?” He asked me in a scared voice. “I don’t know.” I admitted. “This wasn’t something I’d planned for, really.” “Then you’ll want me to take the lead, eh?” He asked with a little smile. “You’re always saying I think better on my feet.” “You do, love.” I assured him, and part of me actually relaxed a little. Having Davey stepping up to the plate like this, where it would be me leaning on him for a bit was nice. It felt more like the old relationship I’d had with the other Davey, the more experienced Davey. Fifteen minutes later the doors of the van were open, and we got out at the airport. We were in front of the National Guard hangar, and quickly escorted inside. That was where we found the rest of our friends waiting for us. Poor Trevor was still in his football uniform, although he’d managed to ditch his shoulder pads. Brandon had the red and gold paint he’d worn to the game still on his face, as did Todd. Sean was standing with them, talking quietly with them as we arrived. “We brought some clothes for you.” The agent who’d spoken in the house said and I noticed for the first time that a few of the agents had some familiar-looking duffel bags. Trevor let out a sigh of relief, although he looked damn hot in his football uniform. “Took you guys long enough.” Brandon muttered as we joined our friends. “Hey! Your hair is wet! You got to take a shower! That’s not fair!” “Yeah, well, since Brian was plowing my ass when they broke in, I think it’s better we don’t smell like sex.” Davey murmured. “Oh shit, you guys were bumping when they showed up?” Todd laughed while Sean chortled before frowning. “Sorry.” Sean said. “I… I didn’t remember what you guys were doing tonight. Hell, I wasn’t even sure what night it was.” “You came back in time!” Davey exclaimed in a startled voice. “Keep it down.” Sean said quietly. From their reactions, our other friends had already been told. Brandon was giving him a slightly odd look. “Which Sean are you?” I asked quietly with narrowed eyes. “Huh?” Sean asked with a look of confusion. “Are you the Sean from my timeline, this timeline, or another timeline?” I asked him. “I’m the Sean from this timeline, or what was this timeline until I created a new one by coming back.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “The fucking scientist.” Davey growled. “You’re studying physics now so you can get in with him and keep an eye on him. That’s the plan.” “Yeah, and it kind of worked.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “I’m going to go get changed. Wait until I get back. Sean hasn’t told us much more than that.” Trevor said as he headed off. “Excuse me gentlemen.” The agent who’d talked to me before came over to us. He was no longer wearing his ski mask. “There’s a shower facility here if you would like to utilize it before your plane arrives. You will need to be quick, no more than fifteen minutes.” “Hold the explanations, I’m going to get cleaned up.” Brandon said firmly, giving Sean a penetrating look. “I promise.” Sean said softly and then waited until Brandon and Todd followed one of the agents into a side room. “Damn I’d forgotten how suspicious he could be at this age. Jesus, you weren’t lying when you said you could remember everything better after going back, Brian.” “Yes, well I want to know why, scratch that, first I want to know how you did it.” I said firmly. “Sean, the other timeline’s Sean, he swore it would be next to impossible to beat the jamming device.” “From all the stories you’ve told me about time travel, you should know by know that it’s always up to me to come back and save yours and Davey’s butts.” Sean said with a slight smile and then he frowned. “Ouch.” “Are you hurt?” Davey asked in a worried tone. “Not now, but the crystal-clear memory does have a downside.” Sean answered with a frown as he ran a hand along his flat belly. “Getting shot three times really does hurt, and remembering it as clear as day really sucks.” “I can imagine.” I said with a shake of my head. “So, you came back in time…” “I’m not going to say anything until they get back, Brian.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “Brandon is really big on people keeping their promises, remember? I fucked up one time too many and he dumped me ten years ago. I’ve got a chance to fix that and I’m starting now. If I tell him I’m going to do something, I’m damn well going to do it.” “That’s fair.” Davey said with a stern look at me. He didn’t need to give me that look, but neither did I protest. Sean had a good reason. I hadn’t told him about the breakup between Sean and Brandon in my own timeline, but it had been because of something similar. Everyone was back, dressed in casual clothes, and cleaned up by the time a sleek business jet pulled up in front of the hangar. It had Air Force markings, and a Lieutenant Colonel got out as soon as the plane’s door was open. He had a brief discussion with the agent in charge, and we were quickly bustled aboard. “Gentlemen, please take a seat.” The officer said as we entered the fairly well-appointed jet. There were eight seat, and the Lt. Colonel took one near the front after the rest of us were seated and buckled in. “If anyone’s hungry, the steward will prepare a meal as soon as we’re airborne, or you can just have a snack and something to drink. I haven’t been briefed on why you’re flying to Washington, and was given strict instructions to pass along that there should be no discussion of the reason for your flight. We will be met at Andrews by some people from NSA, CIA, FBI, and DoD who will then debrief you.” “Well, there goes the chance at an explanation.” Davey muttered sourly from the seat next to me. I reached out and squeezed his hand while the plane taxied for an immediate take off. Flying across country was never short, but the plane rumbled with the sounds of its engines going at maximum speed the entire way. I was far too nervous to sleep, and did not feel like joining in on the conversation the other guys started up. Apparently Trevor had been pulled off the sidelines where he was waiting his opportunity to get in the game (he was the backup quarterback still) when two police officers had come up and talked to him at the same time as several more officers found the others in the stands. They’d been taken directly to the hangar where Sean was waiting for them, and there had been only a brief opportunity for him to explain he was from the future, our future, before we’d shown up. Something must have gone really, really wrong. My plans had included placing Sean with the scientist who had first invented time travel in order to keep an eye on him. Sean had agreed to this readily. With the jammer in place, it should have looked like the time travel theory was wrong, and the scientist should have been discouraged, or at least his funders should have been discouraged enough to stop funding his experiments. Apparently that had not happened. The entire trip my mind tried to figure out what exactly had gone wrong. Sean was only a few feet away, but I knew better than to try to get him to tell me with the officer so close. He would follow his orders as all good military men do, and would stop any such conversation before it had more than started. There were unmarked vans waiting for us as we landed at Andrews, and I wasn’t surprised that we were being taken to the Pentagon. What exactly had Sean already told them, and more importantly how had he gotten them to believe him so quickly? We all rode in one van, and with a partition between us and the driver, we could at last talk. “So, you’ve got a lot of questions, right?” Sean asked. “In case you haven’t placed the timing right, everyone here knows your role was to be keeping an eye on the crazy scientist.” I stated and he nodded. “Yeah, I figured that.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “They do tend to get jumbled up at first, don’t they? They’re all so clear and fresh. Well, anyway, your plan’s a good one, Brian, as far as it goes. By 2004, the scientist was ready to try his experiments again, and they didn’t work. The Russian guy pulled his funding at first, and the scientist folded up shop. Then two years later he calls me and said he’d made a breakthrough and gotten more funding. I, of course, volunteered to help him out again, except it was a trap.” “A trap?” Davey asked. “Yeah, somehow he’d figured out about the jamming, and he figured out a counter to it.” Sean stated. “Something about the jamming reminded him of some calculations I’d done when I’d worked with him, and he was waiting for me with the Russian, who’d brought a couple of hired thugs with him. Since I’d called you all beforehand, you were waiting outside, ready to storm in and stop things before they went too far. That part didn’t go too well. They were ready to send someone back, and they were just making sure there weren’t other traps. I’m sorry, but they got the truth out of me with some drugs that had me kind of loopy.” “It happens.” I shrugged. “Yeah, well let’s just say the firefight of you guys trying to break in didn’t go too well.” Sean grimaced. “Their thugs were better than us, mostly I guess since none of us really had any military training. Davey did best, wounding the last thug before the guy killed him.” “Ouch.” Davey grimaced. “Yeah, I got hit in the process too.” Sean added, rubbing his stomach again. “So anyway, the scientist went back first as a test. Shevardnadze had a goon assistant who sent him back. When they verified it was successful, the goon sent Shevardnadze back. I was lying there pretty much bleeding to death. They thought I was dead and ignored me. At first, I was just to out of it to really understand what was happening, and by the time I figured out I had to do something, Shevardnadze had gone back. I got the goon with Davey’s gun, and set the time machine on auto before dumping out Shevardnadze’s body and climbing in myself.” “You came back in the middle of class?” I asked with a little confusion. “The machine is supposed to pick a period where you’re asleep…” “I fell asleep in class.” Sean mumbled with a red face. That got all of us to laugh. I seemed to remember Davey having done something similar on one of his trips back in time. “When I woke up, I went right for the nearest phone. I called Mr. Rush like you’d told me, and explained things to him. Somehow he believed me, and more importantly, he got the right people in government to believe him.” “That would make sense.” I said with a look at the surprised Trevor. “He does have many of the right contacts.” “Well, Shevardnadze and the scientist have been back here in time now for three months.” Sean said. “I don’t know for sure if they’ve done anything overt or not, but they could be planning on taking us out.” “How do they know about me?” I asked with a raised eyebrow and Sean ducked his head. “It was one of the things they tricked out of me.” He mumbled as the van pulled to a stop. The door opened a moment later, and a group of soldiers along with a three-star General were waiting for us. Sean and I got out first, and the General frowned at us. “This better not be someone’s idea of a practical joke.” He grumbled to us. “I wish it was.” Sean retorted and the General nodded. “If you will follow me, we’ve got some people waiting inside to have a little chat with the lot of you.” He said in a tone that left no room for argument. Davey squeezed my hand as we followed the senior officer deep into the bowels of the Pentagon. Once again the world had taken a turn for the worse. Could we put it back on the right track? Chapter 20 “I’m tired.” Davey said to me as I entered the medium-sized room that had been hastily turned into sleeping quarters for all of us. Six cot-beds had been arranged with typical military wool blankets and thin pillows. Davey and the others, except Sean, had gotten here first and already the six cots were now arranged in pairs right next to each other. Our bags were at the foot of each set of cots. “So am I.” I said softly, knowing full well our hosts would be listening to every conversation in this room. It was just after two in the morning by the time our interviewers had called a break. Already I’d been through the basic outline of my story, and filled in quite a few details about my plans for this timeline without giving away too many details about the future, or my original timeline. Davey and I sat down on the cots he’d claimed for us while I looked over to where Trevor and Todd were asleep already, and Brandon was half-dozing as he waited for Sean. “Did they say what time they were going to come get us again?” Davey asked around a wide yawn. “Five o’clock for me.” I answered sourly. That was less than three hours away. “Well, let’s get some sleep.” He said as the door opened again and Sean came into the room. Brandon got up and made a beeline for him. They hugged, as Davey and I had, and then chatted quietly before settling down together on their cots. We knew better than to try and trade notes between us. There had always been a possibility that something like this would happen, and we had planned for it in detail. We all knew what to say, and what not to say. Above all, we were always to tell the truth, and if something should not be answered, just refuse to answer it at all. Questions like “Who will win this year’s election?” would be readily answered, while questions about 1992 would receive no comment whatsoever. What the goals of other time travelers were would also be readily answered, but questions about what happens in 2000, or other years would be met with silence. So far, they were going rather easy on us, although the lack of sleep we were going to experience was deliberate. It was precisely five in the morning when we were woken up and taken for a quick breakfast in another room. Then we were shown to a shower that at least helped us wake up a little more before they once again separated us for individual questioning. Some people might have bothered complaining about the treatment, but I knew it was actually rather mild compared to what could be happening right now. “Mr. Breckenridge, please have a seat.” A middle-aged man I had not met before said as I entered the interview room with two soldiers waiting outside as guards. The room had a small table, and six chairs. Five of those chairs were occupied, and I sat in the sixth. None of the men, and they were all men, were those who had questioned me into the early hours of the morning, but I recognized two of them from another timeline. “Mr. Hoskins, Mr. Thornbull, it’s a pleasure to see you.” I said to the two of them and enjoyed the shocked looked on their faces. “You know these men?” the first man who had spoken asked. “Yes, and no.” I said with a slight smile while openly yawning. At least I was twenty now instead of eighty, where the short amount of sleep would have left me stupid with mental fatigue. “I knew them in my previous timeline, but I’ve never met them in the here and now. Mr. Hoskins would have been working in the State Department around this time, if memory serves, and Mr. Thornbull was an expert at the Hungary desk in the CIA.” “Your memory is accurate, Mr. Breckenridge.” The first man said while everyone looked startled while making notes. “Frankly I didn’t know what to believe this morning as I read through the transcripts of your debriefing last night. I trust you got at least some sleep?” “Not enough, but I’ll sleep when there’s more time.” I said with a shrug. “We have a lot of work to do, I believe.” “I am Will Lerner, and I work for the White House.” He said with a nod. “You already know Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Thornbull, and you were right about their current assignments. With Mr. Hoskins from State is Mr. Eldridge, and from the Department of Defense is Mr. Wolfowitz.” “I thought I recognized you, sir.” I said to the last man. Maybe I was more tired than I thought. He was a man I should have recognized, but then again I’d never actually met him in person. “You must imagine how skeptical we all are about what you and Mr. Rule claim to be.” Lerner said carefully. “Still, you have both shared knowledge that should not be known to college students, and given enough examples to lend credibility to your claims. We have some more questions for you this morning.” “Please, I will answer what I can.” I stated. “Good, now why are you refusing to answer certain questions?” Wolfowitz started aggressively, leaning forward as he asked. “Certain questions of a political nature I will refuse to answer.” I shrugged. “I’m not going to see time travel information used for the personal gain of certain individuals.” “But you’ll use it for your own personal gain?” Wolfowitz countered. “Did you not use your knowledge to buy a winning ticket for your… lover’s mother?” “Yes.” I admitted. “Did you not plan to do something similar with an even bigger lottery in the near future?” He continued. “Yes.” I admitted. “So you’ll use your knowledge for your own personal gain, but not for anyone else?” Wolfowitz spoke in clipped tones. “Isn’t that hypocritical?” “Yes, but I’ve never claimed I could not be hypocritical.” I said with a shrug. “But there’s more to it than just financial gain. This country faces issues, and days ahead, that are vastly different than what we are accustomed to facing today. In past timelines, we were ill prepared to adjust our worldview to the new paradigms as they arose. As a result, we stumbled badly in our foreign policy decisions and greatly hurt American interests even though we thought we were doing the right thing. The lottery winnings will be used to help establish a foundation that will hopefully, over the course of several decades, help our country adjust to the changing world and not make the same mistakes. I certainly do not want to see the United States held hostage by foreign nukes planted off our shores, or our soldiers chased out of once-friendly countries.” “And you believe you’re wise enough to make these kinds of decisions?” Lerner asked. “I’ve worked for the United Nations, and the U.S. State Department, as well as on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for most of my adult life.” I replied with a very slight shrug. “For sixty years I was heavily involved in this nation’s foreign relations. For ten years I was the spouse of the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and turned down two direct offers of Ambassadorships for myself. Two different U.S. Presidents asked me to be their Secretary of State, and I refused both times.” “Or so you claim.” Wolfowitz spat out. “We’ve just met, gentlemen, but you will find that nothing I’ve told you so far, or will likely tell you anytime soon is a lie.” I countered. “Proving you’re a time traveler isn’t the easiest thing in the world, nor is knowing how to make the most effective use of information. Sure, it’s possible to change things like who becomes President in a given election, but doing that does not necessarily fix long-term problems. To really fix long-term problems requires a different approach than any real, direct change to the timeline.” “But you are not the only time traveler.” Lerner pointed out. “Not anymore, which is why I’m sharing so much with you now.” I said with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “The Russian time traveler does not have the experience with previous timelines that I have.” “But you claim this is the first time you’ve actually traveled in time.” Hoskins pointed out. “That is true.” I answered. “My husband though, had experienced several different timelines. We were together for around seventy years, and during that time I learned a lot about his experiences. Sean, a different Sean if you will remember, had experienced a similar number of alternate timelines and also contributed to my understanding of the complexities of time travel and changing the future.” “You’ve stated the goal of the Russian time traveler is to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Eldridge spoke up for the first time. “Yes.” I confirmed. “You’ll know better than I how effective we were at changing what happens after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Mr. Shevardnadze was the original funder of time travel that started all of this. His goal then, and I cannot imagine it has changed, was to prop up the Soviet Union and keep it alive past 1991. I would imagine his first steps will be to replace Gorbachev, and to stop the relatively free parliamentary elections in Hungary and Poland early next year.” “Mr. Rule’s debriefing mentioned those events and stated that your efforts to ameliorate the effects of the collapse were less than successful.” Wolfowitz said in a tone of superiority. “I’m still in college, I can’t expect to be able to shift the course of the planet just yet.” I shrugged. “It takes time.” “That’s pretty much what he said.” Lerner noted. “He says that your plans were largely focused on the world after the turn of the century, and even after the first decade of the next century.” “That would be accurate.” I agreed. “My goal isn’t to see any specific person elected or not elected, but to change how we look at the world and our role in the world. Hopefully, people will look at the situation differently, and make different choices, but ultimately it will still be up to them to choose. I will not use my knowledge to force change.” “That is a fine line to walk.” Lerner said with a frown. “Still, you are right about the Soviet time traveler. We are hearing rumblings that a coup is happening as we speak. When we first received Mr. Rule’s strange call, we at first didn’t fully believe it, but we did investigate. Then we started hearing rumblings that something was going on in Moscow, and the agents sent to have a discussion with the scientist Mr. Rule identified encountered him being kidnapped.” “They did?” I stated in surprise, and started to worry as I thought about the timeline where the Chinese had sent assassins after Davey’s family, and mine. That made me really worry. “If they went after him, our families…” “Are under observation and are fine for the present.” Lerner stated. “A massive manhunt is underway at this time. The KGB was forced to use agents from their San Francisco mission, and were easily identified. They are hiding somewhere in the Napa Valley, but we’ll find them and retrieve the scientist. Mr. Rule states that his loyalty to the United States is questionable at best.” “I wouldn’t know for sure, but from what I’ve been told in other timelines, I’d tend to agree with that opinion.” I answered the unspoken question. Lerner noted as he checked something off on his notepad. “How do we counter the moves this Shevardnadze will make?” Hoskins asked after the room had been silent for several moments. “Kill him.” I answered emphatically without hesitation. All four men looked shock at the answer. “In the last timeline, Davey arranged a subterfuge. He convinced President Reagan and his own father that he was a time traveler, and then he convinced them that his young brain couldn’t completely hold the ‘advanced’ knowledge and that he would soon lose it forever. They acted on the information and managed to assassinate all the enemy time travelers before they came back in time, effectively ending their ability to go back into that timeline.” “Doesn’t that create a paradox or something?” Eldridge asked with a pained expression. “The way it was explained to me by another Sean still gives me a headache.” I said honestly and with a bit of sympathy. “Supposedly only one timeline can exist at any given moment, but all the instances of time travel coexist simultaneously, so if a time traveler from 2004 goes back to 1976, he creates a new timeline by any changes he makes, but a time traveler from a previous 2004 still exists and will still arrive in 1981. With enough time travelers, and time lines, it gets very confusing. Sean created this chart that showed all the time travelers and their originating time lines one time. I could recreate it for you, but it doesn’t really help. Why it doesn’t create a paradox I don’t know, but the jamming device we developed in my originating timeline was supposed to stop all other time travel, effectively erasing their ability to affect this timeline. Obviously it failed.” “Yes, it did.” Wolfowitz gloated, but settled down after the other men in the room gave him reproachful looks. “In every time line that Shevardnadze has been allowed to impact, a war has happened that caused huge losses of American life.” I pointed out. “Killing him might prevent that from happening now.” “He has already begun changes in the Soviet Union.” Wolfowitz argued. “Killing him now won’t do any good. We need to stop him from ever coming back. The Rule kid states that he might be able to recreate a time machine and a jamming device.” “That will work.” I agreed instantly. “I could help him with the jamming device.” “Even if it means you won’t be able to come back in time again?” Wolfowitz asked with a gloating expression and I paused for a long moment before meeting his eyes directly. “I’d rather… I’d rather a time line where I did not go back than a timeline altered by Shevardnadze.” I said in a firm voice, but I spoke slowly as if the words pained me greatly. “You know, I almost believe that.” Wolfowitz said after looking at me for another long minute. “Why?” “I’m not selfish enough to put my happiness over the lives of thousands, or millions.” I said with a shrug. “But what about the changes you think need to be made?” Lerner asked. “One thing about history is that it shows us there will always be conflict.” I said with a shrug. “The–the things that happen do cost lives, sometimes even thousands of lives, but none of them are as bad as a possible all-out nuclear war, or a direct war between the Soviet Union and the United States.” “Why is that?” Hoskins asked as he leaned forward slightly with obvious interest. “It’s difficult to believe, but the world really does change tremendously after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” I started carefully. “Twenty years from now, an entire generation will have grown to adulthood who do not remember what it was like for two juggernauts like the United States and USSR to stand opposite each other, both capable of wiping out all life on Earth with one decision. Sure, there are still threats. A city might be nuked, or airplanes might be hijacked and slammed into towers, but a war that ends all life on Earth is a science fiction story usually involving aliens instead of a very real possibility. Kids learn about the Cold War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis and other events and they don’t really understand that all life on Earth really could have ended in the blink of an eye while the Soviet Union and the United States faced off against each other. “Likewise, those of us who lived during the Cold War have a hard time adjusting to a world where the biggest threat to our country is that we might lose a skyscraper, or at worst a single city.” I continued. “We remember the perspective of losing our entire planet, and we subconsciously escalate the threat we face then with the threat we face now. So we react out of proportion to the real threat at hand.” “You say that in the future terrorists manage to strike our cities with nukes?” Wolfowitz asked with a shocked look. “In part because we badly handled the breakup of the Soviet Union, yes.” I confirmed. “Which you are trying to change.” Lerner added. “Yes.” I agreed. “I know on the surface it looks like what I was doing seems solely selfish, and I won’t deny there is a selfish aspect to it, but in the long run it was to be for the betterment of our country, and by extension our world.” “I see.” Lerner nodded. “Thank you for your candor, Mr. Breckenridge. We’ll take a short break for now, and begin again in about an hour, over lunch.” “Thank you for listening.” I said politely as they left the room. A soldier poked his head into the room and I followed him out, back to the room I’d slept in with the others. Sean was there already, as was Davey, although the rest of our friends were gone. “Where’s everyone?” I asked. “Getting a tour.” Davey said with a frown. “I wasn’t invited.” “Why not?” I asked. “For some reason they think I know more than I’m telling.” Davey said with a groan. “They seem to think I’m responsible for all this time travel mess, but it was that other me, wasn’t it?” “You’re right.” I assured him. “It’s not fair.” “Nothing in life is fair.” Sean muttered with a shake of his head. “So, Brian, did they bring up the idea of rebuilding a time machine and another jammer?” “Yes.” I said and Davey let out a groan. “They asked me about it too, like I knew anything!” He moaned. “Still, I told them it was probably for the best, to solve this situation, but that maybe someone should go back just to make sure there wasn’t another time travel device, like you’d planned.” “Which is how I’m here, and we’re all here in the Pentagon instead of in the hospital room.” Sean muttered. “What hospital room?” I asked in alarm and Sean frowned. “I didn’t want to tell the others, but on that night, on the way home from the game, there was an accident.” Sean said sadly. “Todd got hit by a drunk driver while they were walking back, and spent six days in a coma before he died. It was weird seeing him after all these years, but that’s at least one good change, although if we do this plan of building another machine, I don’t know what good it will be in the long run.” “Gentlemen.” A voice called from the doorway and we looked up to see an Army Colonel standing there. “Would you please come with me?” We followed the man through the bowels of the Pentagon and up into the actual halls of the regular portions of the building. Our friends were waiting outside a set of doors that I recognized as leading to the Secretary of Defense’s office, all of them looking a little worried. We waited there, not saying a word until the doors opened and we were escorted inside to find a room mostly empty except for a few Secret Service agents, and the President. “I thought I’d come over here and take a look at you myself.” Ronald Reagan said in a slightly cheerful tone as I stepped forward a pace from my friends and moved to shake his hand. “Mr. President, it’s an honor to meet you.” I said. “My name is Brian Breckenridge. These are my friends.” He shook hands as I introduced each of my friends, and then invited us to sit down in chairs that had been arranged in a circle. He took one of the chairs, and I ended up sitting on his left hand. Sean sat on the other side of him. “I find all this hard to believe, but my people assure me it is genuine.” He said after a moment of silence while we all got settled. “One thing that is bothering me: Why would supposedly smart young men like you be working on the Dukakis campaign?” “He’s a loser, Mr. President.” I said with a chuckle as Davey laughed and gave me a knowing look. “There’s no way he was going to win this campaign, but working on it gave us the start of certain connections that will be needed later on. I hate to tell you this, but Republicans don’t hold on to the oval office forever, and well, the Democrats need a lot more help than the Vice-President.” “They always are in need of help, Mr. Breckenridge.” The President laughed before turning serious. “There appears to be open fighting going on in the Kremlin, and we’re not sure which side is going to come out on top. My advisors tell me that the two of you can make another one of these infernal machines, and put an end to this time travel business once and for all.” “Yes, Mr. President.” Sean said in a slightly awed voice. “I believe the problem was that a frequency was left open for Brian’s transport back. With his help, we can isolate all remaining frequencies and jam those too.” “Are you willing to do this, young man?” He asked me with a very direct gaze. “I understand you have some issues.” “I do, but they pale besides the comparison of a war between the USSR and the USA.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. Davey let out a small whimper that drew his attention. “Do you have a problem with this, Mr. Jones?” The President asked him. “It’s just… my life is better than it would have been without his changes.” Davey said slowly but he shook his head. “Still, put up against a possible war with the Soviet’s, it’d be better for my life to go the way it was than for people to die in a big war.” “I can sympathize with that feeling young man.” The President said with a kindly smile. “I asked myself, just to get an idea of what I was going to be asking you young men to give up, how I would feel if such actions meant I would never be President. In the end, I decided that it would be a price I was willing to pay in order to stop a World War.” “We don’t know a World War is going to happen.” Todd argued and then he blushed when the President turned his attention to him. “What do our two time travelers believe?” President Reagan asked. “There will be a war.” I said at once and Sean nodded his agreement. “If you’re sure about it.” Todd said at last with a sigh. “Now, how long will it take to rebuild this time machine, and what resources will you need?” The President asked us directly and I looked over at Sean, who would be the one doing most of the work. I didn’t know half of what was needed, no, not even a quarter! In the end it took five years to build the machine, and the world was a nightmare. Shevardnadze’s hard-line faction won the shoot-out in the Kremlin, and the Soviet Union was ruled with an iron fist. Protests at the ending of Glasnost and similar Gorbachev programs were brutally crushed, and Hungary never voted out the communists. In 1989, the Berlin Wall never fell, and we came damn close to losing West Berlin itself. The scientist who had invented the time machine was never found, until a CIA agent caught wind of him in Moscow during the final days of 1989. Our agents couldn’t get anywhere near Shevardnadze, but they managed to poison the scientist before he could build another machine for the Soviets. The expected response, a KGB attack on Sean and his family only succeeded in killing Sean’s father. Sean shrugged it off as ‘no big deal’. There was an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, but this time it was backed by the full might of the Soviet Union. Thanks to information we had given our government, and the focused efforts of our intelligence agencies, the Iraqis and Soviets had a little surprise as Iraqi troops barely paused to consolidate Kuwait before pushing into Saudi Arabia. An entire carrier battle group surged into the Gulf, and its planes began bombing the Iraqi troops as soon as they were outside the city of Kuwait. American fighters surged from Germany (after being refueled by planes staged in Israel and Saudi Arabia) engaged Iraq’s air force, slaughtering them in a great air-to-air battle that lasted for twelve hours. It took nearly two weeks for two Marine Amphibious groups to arrive, and by then most of Iraq’s armor in the area had been crushed. The US Marines landed in Kuwait with enough force, and complete air coverage, and the remaining Iraqi troops fled Kuwait like rats from a sinking ship. The Soviet Union, with a bloody nose, pulled back for a little while, licking its wounds while the KGB fomented problems for us in South America. In 1992, George H. W. Bush easily won reelection in a Cold War that wasn’t quite so cold anymore. By the end of 1993, we were conducting our first tests with the new machine. The truth was that Sean was right about me. When it came to the theory behind time travel and its operations, or actually putting it together, I couldn’t help much. However, when it came to operating the machine, or the new ‘jamming’ device, figuring which frequencies, and similar things, I ended up being a lot of help. Poor Davey, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd were stuck being with us, acting as moral support most of the time, although each of them helped in their own way. Todd and Brandon helped with different aspects of the computer components or software, working with the experts the government had assigned us as if they had already completed a full college education in their specific fields. Since they spent the first two years of the project going to classes at Georgetown, that was pretty much the case. Trevor helped in other ways, by helping relieve tension when it built up too high, or asking really basic questions when we were stuck, forcing us to think again in much simpler terms. (He called them stupid questions, but they were far from stupid and helped us solve several problems.) Together, all of us made an impressive team, and when the machine was ready for testing, the military took precautions, but did not deny us all a place in the chamber where the machine was waiting. “You understand, no time travelers.” Roger Sazar, the President’s point man on this project said while we waited for the airlock to cycle. We were actually located in a remote facility in the backwoods of Virginia. This was the bunker built for members of Congress in case of nuclear attack, and had everything needed for our experiments. We had a good, strong, dependable power supply, plenty of food and water, and most importantly in the eyes of the government, hundreds of soldiers to make sure no one went back in time. Our mission was simple, power up the machine, activate the jammer that would keep me, and the others, from going back in time, and then wait to make sure the outside world survived. We had plenty of antennas and other equipment that would allow us to monitor the outside world for a long time before we shut down the bubble and ended our own existence. “We understand.” I repeated for my friends one last time as the huge airlock door, nearly five feet of reinforced steel and concrete swung open. Sean and I led the way in, barely looking at the MRI-type machine surrounded by twenty armed soldiers. Davey and the rest followed us into the control room where a bank of control machines waited for us, and a thick glass window allowed us to monitor events in the machine room. There were more soldiers standing guard in here, and two Generals who nodded at us as we entered. “General Crowley, are we ready to begin?” I asked. As head of the scientific team, I was to have the honor of actually giving the orders, but he was here to countermand anything I might do to stop events. Sure, I’d said I was willing to suffer the consequences, but the government was making sure. “You may proceed.” He said as the airlock door closed with a thud. The room was sealed, and my ears popped as it pressurized to prevent any form of attack from outside. We knew the Soviets had gotten wind of our program, and my knowledge of the timeline where they used nukes in an attempt to stop Davey from going back again warned us that if they knew we were acting today, there would be nuclear war. “Power her up.” I said with a nod to Davey. All of my friends had roles to play today, at the controls of the machine. Sure, we admitted it could be operated with fewer people, but the more hands on deck today, the more likely we could succeed. “Um, General, you might want those soldiers to stand further away from the machine.” Sean said with a bit of muffled laughter. “Why is that, son?” The General asked with a frown. “The machine is a Magnetic Resonance Imager, General.” Trevor reminded him. “It creates a very high-power magnetic field that will…oops, too late.” There was a great clatter, and muffled curses coming from the machine room as soldiers lost bits of metal, and their weapons to the magnetic field of the machine. The equipment flew across the room and attached itself to the machine, and the soldiers cursed as they tried to retrieve their gear. “Damn it!” The General cursed as he turned to the other soldiers in the room. “Go help them. No! Leave your gear here! Can you shut the machine down?” “Begin reducing power to the machine, gradually.” I ordered and Sean began moving a lever on the controls as the remaining soldiers in our control room dropped their weapons, and every bit of metal on their body before heading into the other room to help their comrades. It was a shame really, they were just following orders but it was necessary. “What’s happening?” General Crowley asked as the door between the control room and the machine room closed. “We’ve got a breach in the coolant system!” Todd’s voice sounded alarmed and the two Generals and Sazar, the only men in the room besides my friends, rushed to the control panel and looked out the window to where the soldiers were now choking as some gas spewed from the machine. “Get them out of there!” Sazar shouted, looking around the control panel frantically. “Sorry.” Brandon murmured as he, Davey, and Trevor turned around with small stun guns in their hands. All three men received several shocks before they passed out. Then they were tied up, gagged, and sedated with some drugs from a military first aid kit that would guarantee they would not wake up for a while. Outside the last of the soldiers had succumbed to the gas. “I feel…dirty.” Todd murmured as we looked out at the collapsed soldiers. “None of them should be dead.” Davey murmured softly. “C’mon, we’ve got to clean up in there.” Everyone except Sean and I left the control room after the gas was vented from the other room, and the door opened. The machine was powered down just long enough to remove all the weapons and gear attracted to it, and the collapsed soldiers from locations near the machine. Then it was powered up again to full power. “How much power do we have?” I asked Sean who smiled happily. “More than enough.” He answered. “Let’s get this show on the road then.” I replied and went out to the main room, where Davey kissed me before helping me onto the machine’s platform. He handled the needle himself, and kissed me one last time before my eyes closed and I prepared for another trip back in time. Chapter 21 I opened my eyes and smiled at the sight of my old bedroom. Sunlight was just peaking in through the drapes, and I could clearly make out the football and wrestling posters on the walls, the comforter Mom had changed out when I’d reached fourteen, and the older, smaller dresser I’d had until I entered high school. Yep, I’d come back for a third childhood, and the preliminary evidence showed we’d hit it around the right timeframe. I got out of bed slowly, knowing from the last experience it would take a moment to get accustomed to the younger body. Certainly it felt weird being several inches shorter, and about forty pounds lighter, without quite as much muscle buildup as I had in my early twenties. My morning woody was a little different as well, a little smaller, and a lot more sensitive than I remembered it being even at twenty. After turning on the room light, I got a good glance at the calendar and smiled at the pile of books on my desk while the brand new backpack sat on the chair, waiting to be loaded. Yep, it was the first day of seventh grade, and I’d stayed up late last night getting ready, but not loading my backpack until the morning. “Brian!” Mom’s voice was accompanied by a knock. “You better get a move on or you’re going to be late for your first day!” “I’m up mom!” I shouted back, surprised at how my voice cracked right in the middle of that. Oh yeah, I wasn’t out of puberty yet. I’d been spared that particular curse, for the most part, the last time I’d gone back, but as I began to wake up a little more, I could feel how… unbalanced things felt inside of me. This was going to be weird. “What do you want for breakfast?” She yelled back, and I opened the door, forgetting I was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers and that the front of them was tented a bit. She gave me a look that almost made me blush. “Sorry, pancakes would be nice.” I said with a slight smile and she nodded before moving towards the kitchen while shaking her head. For my part, I grabbed a towel from the hall closet and went to take a shower. It was nice being home, and I felt so relaxed as I cleaned up, and took care of the morning business while wondering what Davey was going to look like at this age. Sure, I could call up a memory, but that had been a different Davey. I was going to get to see the original twelve-year old Davey. “Are you excited, honey?” Mom asked me twenty minutes later after I’d dressed in a new pair of jeans, a nice blue button-down shirt with a sleeveless checkered sweater over it, and my loaded backpack was sitting on the floor next to me as I ate breakfast. “You wouldn’t believe how excited I am.” I told her as Dad came into the room, dressed for work. “Morning Dad!” “Morning Brian.” Dad said with a slight smile. “Oh, I don’t know, I can remember the first time I went to Junior High.” Mom said with a wide smile. “Just don’t forget to say hello to your aunt.” “I won’t.” I groaned playfully and she laughed softly. Fifteen minutes later we were walking outside, towards her car, and I remembered why I’d almost been late on the first day of school. “The tires flat!” Mom groaned as she noticed the driver’s side tire. “You’re going to be late for school!” “If you don’t mind getting Dad to change it for you, I can jog and make it to school on time.” I offered and she frowned. “I don’t want you showing up to your first class all sweaty.” She stated. “Don’t worry mom, get dad to fix the tire and I’ll get to school.” I said as I leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek. I still had to stand on my tiptoes to do that. “Okay, but you be careful!” She yelled. It wasn’t that bad of a jog to school, and I passed the familiar faces of Ronna and Jeanette on the way. They looked young, and were happily talking away to each other, but Davey was nowhere in sight with them as he’d been before. How many times had he told me the story about me bumping into him that first time he came back in time? It was a little disappointing to me that he wasn’t there now, but the sight waiting for me at the end of the bike path more than made up for that lack. “Heya, Bri.” Trevor said with a smile as I came to a stop next to him. “Yo Bri, glad you could make it.” Brandon added with a smile, and then turned back to tickle Sean who was too busy giggling to do more than wave. Todd was laughing at their antics from where he stood next to Trevor. His red hair was longer than I remembered, and he looked like a stoner, but otherwise was very much the Todd I remembered. Davey was standing there, on the opposite side of the circle of friends from me, giving me a very welcome smile. It was so hard not to take him in my arms and kiss him right here and now. He was only slightly overweight, and there was a nice-sized pimple on his right cheek, but he was my Davey, and the best part was the Davey looking out at me through those eyes. It wasn’t the twelve-year old, but the slightly older, slightly more mature Davey from the last timeline. The one who’d managed to make it through the challenges of rough teenage years and become a good man. “Looks like we all made it this time.” Davey said softly. “Yup, just like Brian planned.” Todd added. “You come up with good plans, Bri.” Trevor added with a sigh. “So what happens now? We never got enough time where they weren’t listening to go into too many details about what happens when we all get back.” “We’ll discuss it after school, okay?” I offered. “You mean after flag-football practice.” Brandon pointed out. “Well, what are Sean and I going to do while you boys get all hot and sweaty?” Todd asked. “What about me?” Davey pointed out. “I’m not on the team.” “Like hell you’re not.” Trevor snorted. “You’re signing up today.” Brandon said as he got Sean into a headlock and proceeded to give him a noogie. “As for these two, we could use some pretty cheerleaders.” “I’d watch that if I were you.” Sean growled as he slipped out of the headlock and managed to kick the back of Brandon’s knees, sending him to the ground. We all laughed as Brandon looked up in surprise at his boyfriend. “I learned wrestling in the last timeline, remember?” “Yeah, I remember.” Brandon laughed. “Just checking to see if your runt of a body could still get out of it.” “Runt of a body, you really don’t want any do you?” Sean teased him. “Um, about that.” Brandon said and he looked over at me. “Aren’t we like twelve now?”",

Yes, trust Davey to let his anger get the best of him and tell everything, or nearly everything. “I told her.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “I told her that Brian and me had been a couple, as in lovers, that we loved each other. Then I told her that after I heard her talk about Sean that way that I knew she’d never accept us, so I broke things off and started dating girls to make her happy, but that I’d never sleep with any of them because I loved Brian.” “Holy shit.” Todd said with a hint of respect in his voice. “What happened then?” “Heather slapped me.” Davey chuckled but he was on the verge of tears still and he squeezed my hand tightly. “Riley just shook his head and the three of them left before my mom started to tear into me. You know, she has no problem believing I’m a ‘fucking pervert’, but she says I seduced Brian, turned him into a pervert and she’s going to warn Brenda to keep me away from him. Then she kicked me out. Told me to pack my car with stuff and get the fuck out of there. Last I heard, she was on the phone to Nanny and Papa after she called Dad and blamed him for perverting their son.” “Jesus fucking Christ.” Todd muttered while I pulled Davey into me closer. “I’m so sorry, Davey.” I said softly. “It’s not your fault.” Davey said with a sigh. “I don’t know why I thought pretending would fix anything. All it did was make her madder when she found out. I think that’s what she’s so angry about, not that I’m gay so much as the fact that I lied about it to her all this time. Imagine if it had been years and years of my lying to her before she found out.” “Oh believe me, it would have been bad.” I chuckled softly. “The other me tell you about that?” Davey asked and then he looked at Todd for a moment. “You said you told him, right?” “That he’s some weird kind of time-traveler and really a perverted old man in a young body?” Todd asked rhetorically. “Yeah, he told me. I told him he was wasting his second youth. He should be out there screwing everything in sight that he knew would bend over instead of pining after… oh, um, sorry.” “I… I thought the same thing at first.” Davey said with a blush. “Sometimes I wonder if he’d have been better off without me in his life.” “No, never that.” I said with a shudder as I remembered Davey telling me about that life in another timeline. “So, my other self, he told you about her finding out one time?” Davey asked with a little half-smile. “I can tell you later.” I said. “Is it funny?” He asked. “Yes.” I answered. “C’mon Davey, you know your life. Do you think the story would be anything but funny?” “I need to hear it, please?” Davey asked in a needy voice and I had to sigh before giving in to him. I should still be angry at him, part of me said, but I loved him. “It was in the original timeline.” I began to tell him a story of an alternate version of his life. “You’d joined the Navy after dropping out of Downey. Three years later you were in the Gulf War.” “Gulf war?” Todd asked. “Yeah, in 1990 Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq invades Kuwait and we not only stop him there, but kick his ass back to Baghdad.” I answered. “So anyway, on the way back, this ship you were assigned to stopped in Hawaii. You flew your boyfriend, Keith, out to see you there, planning to spend a whole week on that tropical island with him.” “Sounds fun.” Todd murmured a little jealously. “How’d I afford that?” Davey asked. “You saved up a lot of money for him.” I answered with a shrug. “Anyway, two weeks before you pull into Hawaii, you call your mother from Hong Kong. Somehow her and Jenny scraped up enough money to go to Hawaii at the same time you were going to be there.” “They didn’t know at the time, did they?” Davey asked and I grinned. “That sucks.” Todd groaned. “Vacation ruined.” “Yup.” I chuckled. “You spent the week trying to find time to have sex with your boyfriend you haven’t seen in six months. Your sister kept trying to trip him into her bed, and your mom wanted to spend every minute she could with you. Needless to say it was a very frustrating week for everyone. After it was over, you went back to San Diego where you were stationed, and you lived with him.” “That must have been nice.” Davey said wistfully as he relaxed against me. It felt so natural for us to be like this. “I’m sure it was.” I murmured. “Anyway, you were planning this big birthday party for your sister. Your family was all going to come down, and you hired caterers and everything. You told me you got a second job as a bouncer at a bar in order to get enough money to do all this. Then, the night before your sister and mother were to fly down, your mother called. There was another roommate you shared the apartment with besides your boyfriend, and his boyfriend answered the phone. When he told your mom you were at work, she asked for and got the number.” “This doesn’t sound good.” Todd added. “Nope.” Davey agreed, but he was smiling. “Anyway, your mom called the bar, and got the answering machine.” I continued the story. “It said: Hi, you’ve reached Rich’s, the biggest Gay Bar in San Diego…” “Hah!” Todd started laughing while Davey shook his head. “What did she do?” Davey asked. “She left a message.” I chuckled. “She said ‘Tell David Jones Jr. to call his mother this instant!’ It was an hour before he got the message and he rushed to a payphone to call her. The first words out of her mouth were “Are you fucking Keith?” “No, he’s fucking me.” Davey muttered the punch line of his own story from a time he never knew, shocking me. “Well, that’s what I would say.” “That’s what you did say.” I laughed softly and Todd shook his head. “It was months before the two of you ever talked again, but she called Keith each and every night for two weeks.” “I wonder what ever happened to him?” Davey asked. “If I loved him, why wasn’t he around later when…” “I asked about that.” I admitted. “He… he was partying with some guys and flew off to San Francisco with one of them who was really rich, and that was the last that Davey ever saw of him. Two months later, you moved back home with your mother to go back to college. Keith had taken all the money you’d saved up, and you didn’t have enough for rent, and by that time you were out of the Navy.” “That sucks.” Todd shook his head. “I hope I end up with someone like Brian. He’d never do something like that.” “But I would, I did.” Davey said glumly. “Davey, there’s always a room here for you.” I said softly. “I don’t care if we’re talking or not, boyfriends or not, there is always a place here for you. My parents would kill me if I didn’t support that.” “They’re probably as pissed at me as you are.” Davey said miserably. “I certainly hope so.” I said with a laugh and he looked at me like I was insane. “Doofus.” Todd said to him. “You don’t get it, do you? Brian’s saying he’s forgiven you.” “You are?” Davey asked me and I nodded after a moment. “Why?” “Because I love you, and, well, you came right to me after your mother kicked you out.” I said with a shrug. “You got kicked out because you told the truth about you and me, and the only reason to tell the truth would be because you want us to be back together.” “You figured all that out, eh?” Davey asked with a shake of his head. “Yeah, I did.” I acknowledged. “So where do we go now?” Davey asked. “Shit, Heather! It’s going to be all over the school now.” “You never do anything halfway.” Todd said with a grin. “It’s all or nothing with you.” “Shut up.” Davey growled. “My god, we can’t go to school tomorrow! It’s Homecoming!” “We will go, and I’ll be right there with you.” I assured him. “Me too.” Todd added. “Oh, don’t glare at me like that, Davey. I like Brian a lot, maybe too much, but I know a lost cause when I see one. Without you in the picture I might have a chance, but if there’s even a hope of him being with you, he’ll never look at me as more than a friend.” “Damn right about that.” I growled. “Okay, fine, but I’ll be watching you, Todd.” Davey glared at his friend. “Davey, Brian, are you in here?” Mom’s voice announced her arrival, and her worried tone said she’d spoken with Sandy already. “We’re in here!” I half-yelled and she entered the room, stopping as soon as she saw Davey in my arms. “Well, that’s at least one problem solved.” She said and then she looked at Todd with an inquiring look. “I’m pissed that Brian’s not on the market anymore.” Todd said to her with a shrug, which was a little brave of him. He smiled when my mother shook her head at him. “Brian, dear, do you have any boy friends who are actually straight?” Mom asked me with mock exasperation. “Not that I can name off the top of my head, no.” I laughed. “How are you holding up, dear?” Mom asked Davey as she reached the couch and put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m better now than I have been in a long time.” Davey answered with a relieved sound. “I hate to have to ask this but…” “We’ll get your room ready for you later tonight.” Mom said. “Sandy’s still in the yelling mood and won’t listen. I’m going to pick up Bev in the morning and we’re going to tag-team her. You won’t have to stay here for more than a day or two.” “I’m sorry, Mrs. B.” Davey said softly. “It’s Brian you need to apologize to, and those poor girls.” Mom answered him. “The girls?” Davey asked with confusion. “Yes, dear, those girls.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “You’re a smart enough young man to figure out why.” “I used them.” Davey said after a moment. “I led them on, made them believe that more was possible than there really was.” “Yes, dear, you did.” Mom’s tone made her feelings about that crystal clear. “This is not going to be fun.” Davey said with a heavy sigh, causing Mom to chuckle a bit. “Well at least things are back on the right track.” She said with a light tone before looking over at Todd. “You going to stay for dinner?” “I better be getting home.” He said a little reluctantly. “I’ll see you two at school. This is going to be fun.” “God I hope not.” Davey said miserably, but there was a little smile on his face as Todd left the house. “Brian, your father should be home in time for dinner so we’ll fill him in on the day’s events then.” Mom said. “Why don’t you help Davey unload his car? It looks like it’s filled.” “Okay mom.” I said. Davey and I got up then and started to unload his car. He’d packed it mostly with clothes, and a few other odds and ends, which made quite a pile on the bed in the guest room. We were taking in the last load when Dad’s car pulled up in the driveway. Davey and I paused as he got out of his car and looked at the two of us. “Well, this is a surprise.” He said after a moment. “A pleasant one at that. I take it Davey’s finally come to his senses?” “You might say that, and my Mom doesn’t want me around at the moment.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Well, why don’t we all head inside and you can fill me in on the details?” Dad said in a kindly tone that seemed to relax Davey a bit. We finished telling the story over dinner, and Dad was just reiterating his support for Davey when there was a banging on the front door. “That would probably be Pete.” Dad said with a wry chuckle as he got up. Sure enough, it was Davey’s grandfather who stormed in the house, glaring at Davey who was looking a little sheepish. “What kind of tomfoolery are you getting yourself into now, boy?” Pete demanded angrily. “Your mother tells me you’ve gone and decided to be a pervert. You know your soul will burn in hell?” “That’s enough of that, Pete.” Mom said sternly. “Don’t give me no lip, Brenda.” Pete half-snarled. “You don’t know the bible. It says…” “Judge not lest ye be judged.” Mom interrupted him, and for the next twenty minutes I learned something about my mother that I had never known before. She held her own against Pete, quoting a bible verse to counter every one he threw at her. Halfway through Pete relaxed from the angry stance he’d had to something more like his normal self. Finally, he just grunted at her. “Well, we’ll know which of us is right on Judgment Day.” He said flatly before turning back to Davey. “You know I don’t approve of this no matter what she says.” “I know.” Davey said in a firm voice. “I don’t tell you how to live your life, though, Papa.” “Damn right you don’t.” Pete groused and then he nodded. “Fine, you’re going to do what you want to do. Just don’t make me ashamed to be related to you.” “I won’t.” Davey said sternly and Pete nodded before turning to leave without saying another word. “I have no idea what that means.” Davey admitted as the door closed behind his grandfather. “It’s a start.” Mom said softly. “Don’t worry Davey. Your family will come around given time. If he didn’t care, he’d not have come here, and he’d not have stayed as long as he did, or left like that.” “I hope you’re right, Mom B.” Davey said with a heavy sigh as he leaned against me. “She is.” I assured him. Chapter 18 I remembered the last timeline quite clearly, and the reactions of Davey’s family to his sexuality. An older, wiser Davey had years and years to prepare them in subtle ways. Sometimes I think he did it almost without even thinking or planning it, just presented his family with ‘learning experiences’ that nudged them in the right direction. Unfortunately, he had none of that in this timeline. He didn’t have the experience of his first disastrous coming out, nor the memories of years of arguments and discussions that had finally led to grudging acceptance. Nor did he have the years of preparation based on those memories. Instead, he just had me, my parents, and his Aunt Bev. As it turns out, Aunt Bev was all he needed anyway. The woman was a force of nature with an indomitable will. According to her family, she’d always been strong-willed, but recovering from the accident that had left her paralyzed from the neck down had transformed her from merely strong-willed to something else, something more. She might not be able to get out of her wheelchair without someone lifting her, but she was more than capable of lifting anyone by the figurative neck and slapping them around verbally until they saw things her way. The first person she set her sights on that night of Davey’s ‘coming out’, was Davey. She grilled him for nearly an hour over the phone, and at times he was angry, blushing from embarrassment, or silent as she let him know what she thought. The second person to benefit from her opinion was me. That conversation was far shorter, and after a few questions that started with “When did you know you were homosexual?”, most of the conversation was her warning me to not hurt her Davey. “I really don’t want to go to school today.” Davey said early the next morning when I went to his room to wake him up for an early morning run. “I think I’m going to be sick.” “Your stomach is all tied up in knots.” I stated flatly and he nodded with a miserable look on his face. “I feel like I’m going to puke.” He really did sound miserable. “You always feel this way when things are like this.” I said with a shrug. “You told me that it just got worse as time went by and you had to learn to ignore it, to just move forward despite the yuckiness. You told me that if you hadn’t learned to do that, you’d have never succeeded in making anything better in your life.” “I hate that me.” He said with a shake of his head before climbing out of bed and stumbling around to get a pair of sweats on. “I bet that me liked getting up early too.” “No, he hated it with a passion.” I laughed. “Good, at least he didn’t go totally crazy.” Davey sighed. “Let’s get the show on the road.” After stretching out, we jogged at an easy pace for two miles. He actually managed a smile on his face when Mom served us breakfast, and we headed out the door a little early for school. Today we both went in my car, and we pulled into the parking lot nearly a half-hour early. “Oh shit.” Davey mumbled as we got out of the car and saw Heather and Riley standing nearby. Heather had a very determined look on her face while Riley looked uncomfortable. His girlfriend was nowhere to be seen, which I couldn’t decide if that was good or bad. As they walked towards us, I watched Davey take in a deep breath before letting it out slowly. “Well?” Heather said in a stern voice as she crossed her arms and stopped just a foot away from Davey. “I’m sorry.” Davey blurted out and managed to look surprised at his own words. Heather cocked her head to the side and raised an eyebrow but otherwise remained silent, obviously waiting for more. “I’m sorry for misleading you, Heather. You’re a good person. Bright, funny, and very beautiful and you deserve to be treated better than I treated you.” “Oh, I don’t know.” Heather said sarcastically. “You treated me pretty good except for the whole making me think you were interested in me thing.” “I do like you, as a friend.” Davey said defensively. “I almost… I almost wish things were different so I could really be interested in you that way, but I’m not and it was wrong of me to lead you on.” “So you really are queer?” Riley said in a neutral tone and then he looked at me with a very direct look. “You and him both.” “Yes.” Davey said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. “Why?” Heather asked. “Why what?” Davey responded. “Why did you go out with me, and the others as well if you knew you were queer and obviously have nothing against it.” Heather asked. “It was my mother.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and he put everything on the table, although he didn’t mention Sean’s name. While he left that out, he told just about everything else in about fifteen minutes. People walked by us while he talked, but something about how we were standing kept them from approaching, even Brandon and Trevor who arrived just before Davey finished. “I accept your apology.” Heather said when he was done while Riley stood there shaking his head. “I don’t quite understand why you’re queer and don’t have a problem with it, but at least you’re man enough to stand up for yourself. I won’t say anything to anybody, on one condition.” “What’s that?” Davey asked. “Homecoming is tonight.” Heather said with a steely gaze. “We made plans.” “I know.” Davey said softly. “Good.” She said firmly. “You’re going to carry through with them. After tonight, you and I will break up, but for the rest of today we’re still a couple. Anyone have any problems with that?” “No.” Davey and I said in unison while Riley shook his head. “What about you, Riley?” Heather asked. “You got any problems keeping quiet about this stuff if Davey follows through with tonight?” “I don’t understand this whole queer thing, but I’ll keep my mouth shut as long as you don’t try anything with me.” Riley said quietly. “Good, now Davey, put your arm around me and walk me to class.” Heather commanded with a questioningly look at me. I just smiled and waited for them to move off. When they were gone, Riley stayed put, giving me a searching gaze. “You know, I’d have never thought you were a queer.” He said with a disbelieving shake of his head. “Then again, after that shit you went through with Marcie, I might have given up on girls altogether too.” “Yeah, well, it’s a little more complicated than that.” I said with a shrug. “You going to be okay?” “Yeah, I’ll be fine.” He said before walking off. As soon as he was gone, I was swarmed by Trevor and Brandon, who had hooked up with Sean and Todd. Everyone wanted to know what was going on, and when they heard that it sounded like we weren’t going to be outed to the entire school, they all looked a little relieved. As expected, Heather won Homecoming Queen, and Davey was King. She seemed to be very happy with the day’s events, and the fact that we won the game that night made it even better. What was best of all was the fact that she kept her promise, as did Riley (and his girlfriend). There was no public outing for us at Downey that year, although there were whispers and by the time baseball season rolled around, we were pretty sure everyone guessed that Davey and I were a couple. No one brought it out in the open though, and as long as we didn’t do anything too public, it seemed like people were fine with leaving it as just a rumor. I heard a few rumors about Sean and Brandon towards the end of the year, and even I was surprised about Todd and Trevor. The two of them somehow became thick as thieves, and by the time of Davey’s eighteenth birthday it was readily apparent they were a couple. Davey’s family more than made up for the lack of drama at school. Frantic middle-of-the-night calls from an angry Sandy woke all of us up several times until Mom took the phone off the hook. In November, Davey’s father stepped into the mix, at Sandy’s request, and the fireworks really exploded between father and son. We all did what we could to support Davey, but he would fluctuate between being overly happy and depressed. It was after Thanksgiving that things really came to a head. Both of Davey’s parents insisted that he get ‘counseling’ at a local church. Davey kept refusing, and his parents pulled the law into the fight. They reported him as a runaway, and we got a visit from the local police department one night. Legally there was nothing we could do immediately, and Davey left with the two officers who took him back to his mother’s house where his parents were waiting with the pastor of the church offering counseling for ‘troubled youth’. The next morning, both Mom and Beverly ‘quit’ working for Sandy. Dad, at my urging, called the local Social Services department and a figure familiar to me made a visit to Davey’s home, just in time to see the action. After Davey had rudely rebuffed the efforts of the pastor the night before, the man had convinced Sandy to order Davey committed for ‘treatment’ as a ‘rebellious, out of control teenager’. They made up all sorts of things about drug and alcohol abuse, that might have been true two years ago, but were not true now. Mary Lou Hacker walked in just as three burly men were attempting to subdue Davey and get him into a van that would take him to the ‘treatment center’ in another state. Sean, having been subjected to a similar treatment by his own parents had done more than enough to warn Davey, who fought as hard as he could. Mary Lou, hearing screaming and shouting, had entered the house and immediately called the police to come and sort things out. It was Pete who entered the scene and ended the chaos of that day. Sandy had called her mother in tears and the two of them had driven over immediately. By this time the police had arrived and Mary Lou was trying to figure out exactly what was going on there. Pete walked into the house while Monta went right to Sandy who was crying. Mary Lou, a shrewd judge of people, immediately focused on him. “Who are you?” She asked Pete. “I’m Sandy’s father.” Pete said gruffly as he eyed the woman. “Who are you?” “I’m Mary Lou Hacker, with Social Services.” She said and then quickly explained how she’d gotten involved. “Those idiots.” Pete grumbled at once, giving a glance over to where Sandy and David Sr. were sitting. Davey’s father looked offended, but stayed silent. “If the boy’s a queer, he’s a queer. Trying to beat it out of him ain’t gonna do no good.” “What do you mean?” Mary Lou asked him sharply. “The complaint is that he’s been rebellious, drinking, using drugs, and running away from home.” “Hah!” Pete laughed. “Sandy told the boy to get the hell out of her house when he told her he was a queer and he’s been staying with some good people since then. Hellfire, one of them works for Sandy!” “Not no more she doesn’t.” Sandy interjected at that point with an angry tone. “Your loss, girl.” Pete told her with no sympathy. “I’ll admit Davey had a little spell with drugs and alcohol a couple of years back and I was mighty worried about him, but since he met up with this new group of friends he’s finally gotten his life put back together, even if he’s decided he’s a queer. Hell, I can live with him being a queer if it means he ain’t going to piss his life away. There’s worse things in this world than fudgepackers.” That last he said with a glare at Davey’s father. “You’re saying he’s not a runaway?” Mary Lou asked Pete. “That’s what I said, lady.” Pete grumbled, hating to have to repeat himself. “As far as you know he hasn’t been using alcohol or drugs?” She pushed further. “Well, I know he’s had a beer when we go fishing, but just one.” Pete admitted gruffly. “Once in a while we’ll have some wine with dinner at Brian’s.” Davey added, gambling that honesty would win him more points rather than get him in trouble. “That’s definitely not alcohol abuse.” Mary Lou said with a sigh. “Now, what’s this about him being gay?” “I am gay.” Davey said sharply. “They don’t like that and they’ve been insisting I see this Christian counselor. They made up all the other shit so they could commit me the same as Sean’s parents did to him.” “Sean Rule?” Mary Lou asked with a sharp look at Davey. “Do you know him?” “He’s a friend of mine.” Davey said simply and she nodded. “The boy is lying.” The Pastor of First Baptist broke in at that point but he got a stony stare from Mary Lou in response and eventually closed his mouth. “Mr. Barrow, in your opinion is there any need for Davey to be committed?” Mary Lou asked his grandfather. “Hell no.” Pete said firmly. “Do you think you might be able to take him in while his case is reviewed by Social Services and he’s seen by a professional?” She asked. “Wait a minute!” Sandy exploded. “There’s no need for that.” Pete shook his head. “The boy has himself some good people to stay with where he has his own bedroom, which he wouldn’t have at my place. What’s more, he’s got money in a trust fund that Sandy set up, and she named me as the trustee on it so she can’t cut him off.” Sandy didn’t even bother trying to protest against her father. She just started crying again. Mary Lou took all that in, before nodding and suggesting that Pete call these ‘people’ so she could talk to them. An hour later, Davey was back at home, and I was holding him while he cried. We were all lucky that day. Somehow it stayed out of the local papers, and outside of the families involved, no one seemed to know what happened (except for our friends, of course). Davey was less than two months away from his eighteenth birthday, and so he got a lot of leeway that Social Services wouldn’t have been able to give him otherwise. It was the week before Christmas before Davey spoke to his parents again. Bev and Pete had harangued everyone until they had all agreed to apologize to Davey. What’s more, Bev had talked them into family counseling, with a counselor recommended by Mary Lou. By the end of the school year, they had all changed in some surprising ways. In February, Davey moved back in with his mother, at the same time that his father was invited to move into the home. Jenny had been the one to make the final call on that decision, and while she would forever be affected by what had happened to her, the family counseling had done a lot to heal her of the worst affects. She was a lot closer to the young woman I remembered her being than when I first had arrived in this timeline. High School Graduation came around far sooner than I had ever imagined possible. Davey and I celebrated together, along with our friends at a private party. The next day we spent a lot of time saying goodbye to our families in the typical teary-eyed farewells that happen when kids finally grow up and set off on their own. It was my father who drove us to San Francisco where we boarded a plane that took us on a two-hour flight. Todd, Sean, Brandon, and Trevor would all be following us to the same school, but they weren’t coming until later. Davey had insisted we share everything with them, and all of them had demanded they wanted to be a part of our plans. Trevor had turned down the USC scholarship and instead gotten one for ASU. Sean had qualified for several academic scholarships, as did Todd. Davey’s father, who was becoming more like the man I’d known as time passed and he mellowed out, was overjoyed that his son would be going to Arizona State University. The man had been born and raised in Phoenix, and was already planning a trip out to visit. Luckily he wasn’t planning on staying with us. With all of us pitching in together, we were more than able to afford an off-campus house. Truth be told, Davey and I could have afforded it by ourselves, but with all the others coming, there was no reason not to share. Together we leased a four-bedroom home that was six blocks from campus, and Davey’s mother had helped us furnish it. Her business had nearly collapsed when Mom and Bev quit, and I think at least some of the reconciliation with Davey had been to get those two women back to work with her. She’d been lonely without their company, and although she hated to admit it, she needed them far more than they needed the work. “Jesus it’s hot!” Davey murmured as we walked out of the air-conditioned baggage claim area. The heat hit us like a brick wall, and both of us immediately started sweating. I’d been to Phoenix a few times in the last timeline, mostly to visit Trevor and his family, but I’d never gotten use to this heat. “Just wait.” I mumbled. “It gets worse.” “Why the hell are we going to school here instead of somewhere colder?” Davey muttered as we hailed a taxi. Instead of answering I just gave him a withering glare and he had the grace to shrug off his own question. Fifteen minutes later we were at our new house, a fairly nice two-story home, and we unloaded our bags in the room that would be ours. “I bet our air-conditioning bills are going to be horrible.” Davey complained as the air conditioner brought the house down to a reasonable temperature. “Just during the summer, and it’ll only be the two of us most summers.” I reminded him. “Do you really think I can cram in enough classes to graduate in three years?” He asked me with a worried look. “If we both study hard, we can.” I assured him. “It will mean that we won’t be able to party as much as everyone else.” “You mean we won’t have as many opportunities to get in trouble.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “No thanks. With my luck I’d get drunk off my ass and thirty years later someone will come up with pictures of me puking on the sidewalk. I can live without all that shit.” “Glad to hear that.” I said with a smile. “As long as you and I get to fuck like bunnies.” He leered at me. “We’ve got an hour before we have to be on campus.” I reminded him. “You want to break the bed in?” “Let’s.” Davey said with a grin. We made it on-time, barely, to the special orientation the school had set up for the few freshmen who were getting an early start to their college education. It was a Saturday, and we had most of the afternoon to look around the school and surrounding area. On Sunday, we spent several hours on the phone to family and friends back in California, most of whom thought we were crazy for going to summer school. Then on Monday, we started our first day of classes. That summer wasn’t easy on either one of us. We had selected our courses for that first semester with great care. I had been through college before, and could remember what a difference it was from high school. In high school, much of the work was memorization of facts, dates, information, etc. with very little ‘opinion’ thrown in the mix. College was more about the ‘why’ and the ‘how’. That was why our first courses were the introductory political science course necessary for our major (International Relations) and the six-week intensive Russian Language course. ASU had one of the best Russian language courses in the nation, and many of their students were recruited by the U.S. State Department for work in their embassies and other facilities. The NSA also recruited heavily from the school, another reason for why I picked that school for undergraduate work. In many ways, it was better for what we wanted than the bigger-name Ivy League schools with more prestigious programs. After the first summer session, Davey was about ready to tear his hair out, and even I was tired. Still, we signed up for another intensive language course for the second summer session, which would put us a full year ahead in the foreign language requirements. We didn’t take any other course, and so by the time our one-week break between the second summer session and Fall semester arrived, we were both only half-crazy. Trevor showed up by himself several weeks into the second summer session for his football training camp, and complained non-stop about the heat. Davey’s parents, and his sister showed up for that one-week break, and we spent the entire time following his father around to all of his old haunts. The home he’d grown up in was now an apartment complex, but his school was still there. It was odd seeing his parents back as a couple, but both of them seemed happier. His father had used some of his wife’s lottery money to open up a rental car company in Modesto. Instead of focusing on just the rental car market, he also rented larger trucks and multi-purpose vehicles. After just a few months, he was already in negotiations to open franchises in three other towns in California. Jenny talked about going to ASU, but I had a feeling she was really thinking about going somewhere else for college. My parents made it out for the weekend, along with Brandon, Sean, and Todd. It was nice having our friends around again, although the late August thunderstorms put a damper on our sightseeing both Saturday and Sunday. Davey and I knew to do our runs very early in the morning, when the temperature might get down to a cool ninety degrees. Trevor did too, and we all laughed the one time our roommates tried to go running as late as eight in the morning when the temperature was inching into the mid-nineties and above. The first day of the regular semester started early for both Davey and me. Davey had an eight o’clock three-day a week political science course while I had a math course at the same time. Then there was an hour break for us before our five-day a week Russian 201 course. This was an important one, mostly because of the instructor, Professor Lee. The Professor was a tall man with a wild shock of white hair that still had a few streaks of brown in it. We actually had him for two courses, the grammar-focused 201 course, and the culture/speaking focused 211 course. He was also the professor for a two-day a week course on Soviet History that we were taking. It was part of the Soviet Studies Certificate that was highly prized by the U.S. State Department in potential employees. “Brian, and David, please stay after class for a moment.” He told us in Russian towards the end of the 201 course. After the bell rang, we waited and he nodded briefly to us. “I do not normally see freshmen in this course.” “We took the summer course.” Davey replied to the statement in the language it had been spoken in, Russian. His accent was still off, and the phrasing a bit clunky, but it sufficed. “Do you speak?” Professor Lee asked me. “Of course.” I replied, using the word konyechna. He smiled before grilling us for a few minutes to make sure we really did have a decent grasp of the language. “You will do fine.” He said with approval in English. “What other courses are you taking this semester?” “We are in your 211 course.” Davey answered. “And the Soviet History course as well.” I added. “How interesting.” He said in Russian before switching back to English. “Are you going to major in Russian?” “International Relations with the certificate in Soviet Studies”. Davey answered. “I’ll probably take all four years of language though.” “Same with you?” He asked me and I shook my head. “I’m majoring in Economics with a minor in Russian and of course the Soviet Studies.” I answered. He cocked his head. “Interesting choice.” He said. “Why?” “I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think that within five years the Soviet Union will no longer exist.” I stated in English with a shrug. He just blinked. “What gives you that idea?” He asked slowly and carefully, as if speaking to someone he was worried might go crazy at the drop of a hat. “Gorbachev’s reforms are a starting point.” Davey began our argument. He and I had been over this time and again over the last year. Oddly, it was our favorite topic after sex, and we’d spent a lot of time lying in bed, the room smelling like sex, and discussed the end of the Cold War. “He’s playing with fire in a forest that hasn’t seen a drop of rain in seventy years. Sure, he’s dug a fire pit, ringed it with stones, and is trying to clear away any nearby underbrush, but he doesn’t realize that all it’s going to take are a few gusts of wind and a few sparks, and there’s going to be a forest fire so big nothing can stop it from burning down the forest of communism.” “Nice alliteration.” The Professor said with a slight smile. It was a good alliteration. Davey always had a way with words. “I think it will start in the Eastern European Republics.” I added. “Most likely it’ll be Poland that starts the ball rolling. Solidarity is gaining in strength, even if it is still mostly underground and being supported by the CIA and the Catholic Church. From there it’ll probably head to Hungary, and eventually to Germany. That will really be the death knell of communism, if Germany can reunite.” “Hard-line communists in Russia will probably try to stop it from happening, maybe even try to take down Gorbachev.” Davey added. “But, it’ll be too late.” “That’s what we think, at least.” I said with a shrug. “If you think this, why are you studying Russian and the Soviet Union?” The Professor asked. “If you’re right, any careers you might have planned will not really be needed.” “Russia, and the former communist states will need to adjust to a post-communist form of governing.” I said with aplomb. “They’ll need to learn the basics of a capitalist economy, and they’ll want advice. There will be plenty of opportunities for work, and for making money.” “I think I’m going to enjoy having you two in my classes.” He said after shaking his head. “Maybe we’ll find a few holes to poke in your theories. The Soviet Union has been around a long time, and they’ve gone through periods of reform before. I’ll want you to pay close attention to the sections between Lenin and Stalin, and the Khrushchev years.” “Thank you.” I said with a nod of my head while Davey smiled at him. We talked for a few more minutes before heading out for lunch. Todd was shaking his head after his first lessons in Arabic. Sean was babbling about something from his physics class, Trevor talked about football, and Brandon was mostly silent. Of all of us, his courses in Computer Science were the least developed at this school, and he could have done a lot better by going somewhere else, but this was the school that seemed to allow us all the best opportunity to attend as a group. Our first year in school was tiring for all of us. While no one else was taking eighteen units like Davey and I were, we all had a great deal of focus on our studies. Trevor, Brandon, and Todd attended a few parties, and Trevor was offered to pledge one of the fraternities, but he turned them down. Because we were all in fairly steady relationships, we did a lot less partying than most freshmen, and were slower in making new friends. That wasn’t to say we didn’t have new friends. Of all of us, Trevor was in the most delicate situation. He played ASU football, and they were a team that got a lot of attention. There was intense pressure on him to have a girlfriend, but he quietly refused and people quickly began to realize what was up when they always saw him in Todd’s company. One of the coaches even pulled Trevor aside and made a few ‘suggestions’ that Trevor didn’t even pause to consider. “You’ll never be picked up professionally if you don’t at least play that game.” The Coach warned him. Since I remembered Trevor as having fallen in love, gotten married and having kids with a woman, I was surprised by how he stuck with Todd. Not that it was a bad thing. It was just unexpected. “You know, I could dump Todd and date women, maybe even get married.” Trevor said after he’d come back from that meeting with one of the coaches. We were alone in the house, since Davey and the others had all gone out to see a movie. I’d stayed behind to re-work an essay for my English Lit course. Having lived a whole lifetime already didn’t necessarily provide any assistance when it came to writing this damn essay, and Trevor wanting to talk was a good diversion. “Why don’t you?” I asked him. “I know you’ve always dreamed of being in the NFL, and it’ll be next to impossible if you don’t at least appear to be hetero.” “Do you think I should?” He asked me with a raised eyebrow. “Are you happy with Todd?” I asked him. “I mean, you know most high school romances don’t last forever.” “Look at Davey’s parents.” Trevor countered with a shrug. “His mom married his dad right out of high school, and then he went and did all that shit. Now they’re back together and planning their re-marriage during winter break. Look at my parents. They met in college and they’re still together.” “But do you think that you and Todd have what it takes to last that long?” I asked him. “The last timeline, you and Davey lasted that long, didn’t you?” He asked me. “Yes.” I agreed. “Do you think the two of you will last that long again?” He asked. “I mean, for you it’s going to be two lifetimes with the same man. Don’t you get bored?” “No.” I said emphatically. “I could never get bored with Davey.” “I don’t think I could get bored with Todd, either.” Trevor stated. “He’s fun to be with, and we’re constantly doing things together. He loves football, or at least watching it, and we both love music. There are so many things we have in common, and some things we don’t. It’s like we fit together.” “Okay, if it makes you happy, then I say go for it and damn the consequences.” I told him with a smile. “You know, I think that might have had something to do with me coming back in time. I was looking at the end. Davey was probably already dead, and we’d had such good times together that I didn’t want it to end. So I came back to start over again, to have another lifetime with him.” “Kind of selfish, huh?” Trevor said with a smile. “You say you came back to save the world, but you really came back just to be young enough to pork Davey for another sixty years.” “I’ve been caught at last!” I laughed and we both chuckled before he went to find something to do while I went back to that damn essay. Was I really that selfish? Well, maybe I was, but then a part of me believed that Davey had come back over and over again for me, so why shouldn’t I come back for him? Chapter 19 “Remind me why we’re doing this again?” Davey asked with a heavy sigh as we sat down for lunch. It was a little restaurant just off of Indian School Road, and we both were tired, sweaty, and hungry. We managed to get a sneer from the waiter when he saw the t-shirts we were wearing, but he took our order just the same. “Because it’s important to build the right connections from the beginning.” I reminded him as the waiter left. “You know I support the other guy, right?” He leaned in and whispered with a conspiratorial smile. “Even after all the crap that I told you about in other timelines?” I asked him and he frowned before shaking his head. “I don’t believe I’m really a Democrat.” Davey muttered for the fiftieth time. “Wait until 1992.” I assured him and he shook his head again. Sure, Dukakis lost, and he lost big, and here in Arizona he was wildly unpopular, but working on the campaign built up credibility for later. Davey and I weren’t talking in the fall of 1986, so he hadn’t worked with me on the California gubernatorial election, but I’d been there with bells on. “I know, I know.” Davey said with a sigh. Walking precincts was the basic level of work, along with phone banking, and we were doing both for the doomed Dukakis for President campaign. It helped build credibility for things I wanted to happen down the road, and in Arizona, along with a few thousand dollars in contributions from our trust funds, it had gotten us delegate positions to the national Dem convention this year. Todd and Trevor showed up before we ordered, and they both griped at me for talking them into this. Brandon and Sean both were phone banking today, and probably getting nasty comments and hang-ups, just like we were getting doors slammed in our faces. Four years from now it’d be a totally different story, but this was the here and now, and besides we likely wouldn’t be in Arizona then. After lunch, it was back into the one hundred plus degree heat for more precinct walking. Sure, it was late September, but the heat lingered here well into October sometimes. It was days like this one that made me think I’d picked the wrong school. Dinner reaffirmed my having made the right choice, though, as we showed up at Professor Lee’s house. It was a private dinner, with some of his fellow professors, two graduate students, and then Davey and I. While we were technically in our second ‘year’ of attending college, both Davey and I had accumulated enough credits that we were on the border between Sophomore and Junior status. It wasn’t exactly easy going on either of us. Davey had nearly had a mental breakdown over the summer, and so we’d taken a lighter load for the second half of summer. The truth was I needed that lighter class load too. Then, instead of visiting family in Modesto, we’d taken off for Hawaii and spent nearly two weeks there before the fall semester started. We’d returned a little more tanned, and a lot more relaxed. After dinner, we were sitting around Professor Lee’s living room, sipping cognac and discussing some of the finer points of Stalin’s Five-Year Plan when the Professor got around to the purpose of the dinner. It wasn’t the first dinner we’d been to at his house, and we were always the only undergraduates there, although he had thrown a big party at the end of the year for all of his Russian language students. He had these dinners at least once a month, though. The difference was that he’d just hosted one two weeks ago. “Brian, Davey, I hope you remember the discussion we had when you first came to Arizona State about what you see as the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union.” Professor Lee began, and there was actually a few giggles from the graduate students. “Yes, Professor.” I said while Davey cautiously nodded. “You two did a joint report for me last year where you provided some good supporting facts.” Professor Vikten, a wrinkled, bald man in his late sixties added with a nod towards us. “You had quite a lot of interesting facts in there that I have never seen added up quite that way before. It was either a work of genius or sheer stupidity.” That got more giggles, and a few chuckles from the other professors in the room while Davey blushed and I tried not to laugh. Knowing the Soviet Union was going to collapse, and why it did from evidence after its fall was one thing. Trying to find the evidence to point to it beforehand, without talking about time travel, or having access to classified information was even more difficult. Thankfully the library here kept up to date on a lot of periodicals that had the information we needed for the paper. “I hope you thought it was genius because we both got an A on it.” I finally said after getting the urge to laugh under control. This time there was a lot more open laughter. “Yes, whether it was right or wrong, it was well researched and well written.” He praised us, and from him it was high praise. “It was well written enough that it formed the core of a grant request that we submitted over the summer.” Professor Lee added and this time I was surprised. I had not expected that. “The grant has been approved, and we are forming the research group that will work on the grant. All the people here tonight have expertise in the areas we need, and the idea came from the two of you. I took the liberty of submitting your names to the government already, and the preliminary security clearances were approved for both of you, despite, um well I believe we do not need to go into that.” That did surprise me a bit. It wasn’t until Bill Clinton took office that the rules were changed regarding gay people having security clearances. In this time, merely being gay usually classified someone as a security risk and they would not be given any sort of security clearance by the government. Some strings must have been pulled on this, and it showed I had indeed picked the right school. “We’re going to be studying the economic conditions in Eastern Europe with a focus on how it might bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Davey asked in the silence that followed. “Are you sure we can contribute to that?” “You’re both four-oh students, this was your idea to begin with, and your research papers have shown you know how to conduct proper research.” Professor Vikten said bluntly. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you both were graduate students already. You will of course receive a small stipend, not that either of you need it from what I hear, and you will receive course credit for your work, as upper-division credit. Is it correct that you’re both only taking eighteen units this semester?” “Only eighteen?” One of the graduate students gasped. “That’s right.” I confirmed. “It was getting a little bit much for us over the summer so we decided to lighten the load a bit. It’ll mean graduating after summer school in ’91 instead of Spring ’91, but it’s better than having a breakdown.” “Yes, it is.” Vikten agreed. “Do you think you can handle the extra work if you join us on the grant team?” “We can.” Davey said excitedly. I nodded my agreement. “Good, then let’s start talking details.” Professor Lee said as he finished off his drink and started into the details of what the grant covered, and what each person’s role would be. Honestly, it was more than I could have hoped for, although some of the preliminary conclusions would come too late, I knew, at least it’d be on record that we were part of the team predicting the fall of the Soviet Union when it actually collapsed. A problem cropped up the next week though, when two FBI agents interviewed Davey and me separately. In my interview, it quickly became apparent that the agent didn’t like gay people, and didn’t believe either of us should have a security clearance of any type. Most of the information we would have access to was economic in nature, not military, but it still was sensitive information. “You’re a homosexual.” The agent, a middle-aged man in a dark suit said as he sat across from me at a small table. He looked unpleasant in the extreme. “Yes.” I answered simply and honestly. “Homosexuals can’t be trusted with government secrets.” He stated succinctly and started to stand up. “Why not?” I asked him calmly and he looked at me with a little surprise at the challenge to his statement. “You’re too easy to blackmail.” He grunted. “Blackmail?” I laughed softly. “What is there to blackmail me about?” “The communists could threaten to reveal your perversion publicly.” He said sourly. “Hmmm.” I said while tapping my finger on my chin. “Who would they threaten to reveal it to that would scare me? I just told you, an FBI agent, that I was gay. My parents know. My friends know. My professors know, and many students I go to classes with know or at least suspect. They could shout it from the rooftops, take an ad out in the New York Times, or announce it on television for all I care. How can they use it to blackmail me when I don’t care who knows?” “They could seduce you.” He said flatly. “They could seduce anyone.” I pointed out. “It’s a constant threat, isn’t it? That someone with sensitive information will fall into bed with an agent and give up everything they know for love. Sorry, but I already have someone I love. We’re in a relationship together, and we have been for years. I’m not going to risk that for some random romp in the hay no matter how cute the guy might be.” “It’s easy to say that, but reality is different.” He said. “You’re a guy, a guy who sleeps with other guys. Fidelity isn’t in your nature.” “You don’t know me well enough to say that.” I snapped. “You’re married, and you’re a guy. Aren’t you a risk because some pretty woman might try to seduce you? That happens all the time in this country, you know. Married men cheating on their spouses.” “Don’t try to switch this back on me.” He fumed, but he looked like he was at least thinking. “The purpose of an investigation for a security clearance is to determine if the person will be a risk, right?” I asked him in a neutral tone. “It’s your job to find out as much about me as you can to help you decide if I will reveal classified information to people who should not have it.” “Your explanation is a little simplistic.” He said, but he wasn’t hostile. “How thorough have you been?” I asked him with a raised eyebrow. “What about that bitch, Marcie? Do you have that incident in my file?” “Your ex-girlfriend who tried to trap you into marrying her.” He grumbled. “So you’re not really a homosexual, are you?” “More bi-sexual, but I’m in a homosexual relationship and never plan to leave that relationship.” I shrugged. “I don’t get how you can just blabber about being a pervert.” He grumbled. “You know, I could arrest you for violating the sodomy laws here in this state. How can I give someone who is knowingly breaking state law a security clearance?” “Can the FBI arrest me for violating a state law?” I asked him. “Well I can have you arrested by a state trooper.” He corrected. “The Supreme Court just upheld sodomy laws in Texas a few years ago.” “Yes, I know.” I smiled. “Um, have I admitted to having sexual intercourse in violation of the law?” “You’ve said you were a homosexual.” He stated. “But did I admit to any sexual activity while in the state of Arizona?” I pushed. “No.” He frowned. “So you can’t have me arrested for violating state sodomy laws when I haven’t admitted to violating them.” I pointed out. “Just being gay doesn’t mean I have to have sex here in this state. Davey and I could drive across the border to California if we want and it’s perfectly legal there.” “This is getting us nowhere.” He groused. “No it isn’t.” I agreed. “If you believe I’m a security risk, deny me clearance. All I ask is that you base it on a real judgment about me, not because you believe I’m a pervert. Which I disagree with, by the way.” “Fine.” He grumbled. Davey’s interview went much the same as mine, except Davey really tore into his agent who got decidedly uncomfortable at a few things. My lover’s luck was with him as always, and he had been able to guess the man was a closet case. He’d used that mercilessly to rake the poor agent over the coals without flat out saying he was sure the man was a closet case. The next day word came down that we had received our clearances. Normally we would have gone to the game that night and cheered our school’s team on (and Trevor), but Davey and I wanted a private celebration. I cooked a romantic dinner for two, and we ate over a candlelit table. These moments were important for both of us, because they helped keep our relationship as more than simple friendship. Sean hadn’t gone either since he had a class tonight. After dinner, we put the plates in the dishwasher and moved upstairs to our room, the master bedroom for the house. We had moved Davey’s king-size waterbed out here, and on nights like this one, I was glad I’d insisted we get one of the new wave-less water mattresses. We must have spent a good half-hour doing nothing more than kissing and slowly undressing each other, covering each other’s bodies with our hands and our mouths. Making love with Davey was always different. Sometimes it was quick and dirty, and other times, like tonight it was slow and sensual. We’d achieved another victory, overcoming the homophobic prejudices of the FBI agents, and that made our lovemaking all the sweeter. An hour after we’d begun, I was buried deep inside Davey, his legs over my shoulders, and he was leaning up so we could kiss while I fucked him with long, slow strokes. Everything was so perfect, and that was when the door to our bedroom flew open. We were playing Davey’s radio, one of Asia’s albums in case Sean came home after class and so we hadn’t heard the noises of the black-clad officers entering our house. Until they surrounded us with weapons drawn and pointed at us, we didn’t even know they were in the house. “What the fuck?” Davey yelled at the interruption, and I felt a moment of fear. Had the FBI agents set this up so they could try and get a prosecution of us under the state’s sodomy laws? Would the state even bother prosecuting it since it could result in bad publicity. “Uh, you both need to get dressed.” One of the officers in the black swat gear, his face hidden by a ski mask and his helmet, said in a voice that almost sounded like he was on the verge of laughing. “What’s going on here?” I demanded as I pulled out of Davey. Already I’d gone soft, but I made no move to cover myself. I’d be damned if I’d let these motherfuckers think I was ashamed. “You need to come with us, immediately.” The same officer said in a slightly calmer voice. “Are you arresting us?” Davey demanded as he raised himself up on his elbows and glared at them. “On what charge?” “You’re not under arrest.” The agent said as he signaled with his hands for the other men to leave the room. A few of them were snickering, and one was muttering something that sounded a little disgusted, but that was all. “We’re actually here for your protection, by order of the President of the United States.” “What?” Davey exclaimed in surprise while I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I immediately suspected that somehow, our secret had gotten out. With a sigh I nodded at the officer. “Can you give us a moment to get dressed?” I asked him. “I’m not supposed to let either of you out of my sight.” He said with amusement in his voice. “How much time do we have?” I asked him, trying to think quickly. “Could we take a quick shower so we don’t smell wherever we’re going?” “As long as you leave the bathroom door open and don’t take too long.” He said after thinking for a moment. “C’mon Davey.” I said to my lover. “We’ll shower together to save time.” “Okay.” Davey said in a shaky voice as we got off the bed and headed into the bathroom, leaving the door open. As the hot water gave us a little privacy, I leaned in to whisper to him. “I think somehow they know about time travel.” I whispered. “No shit.” Davey murmured. “What else would get us this much attention? The shit in Eastern Europe doesn’t happen for several more months. How could they know and how in hell do they even believe it?” “We’ll probably find out soon enough.” I said. “We don’t have all night.” The officer called from the doorway, and we finished the shower in a hurry. When we were both dry and headed over to the dresser to pull out some underwear, he spoke again. “You might want to dress comfortably and pack a bag or two with some nicer clothes in them. It’s a little cold where you’re going.” “Where are we going?” Davey asked as he slipped on a pair of red bikini briefs I had bought for him. He looked so damn good in them. “Let’s just say back east.” The officer said with a shrug. “There’s a plane flying in to Sky Harbor right now to pick you and the others up at the National Guard hangar.” “Can we leave a note for our roommates?” I asked as I pulled on a pair of white briefs and a t-shirt. Davey was already pulling out white socks, dress socks, extra t-shirts, and our ties. I went over to the closet and pulled out two pairs of jeans, some polo shirts, and two light jackets that we almost never used here in Arizona. We were dressed quickly, and while Davey packed the small clothes in to a duffel bag, I put some dress clothes into a garment bag. “There’s no need for that.” The officer said. “You almost done?” “We’re done.” Davey said as I zipped up the garment bag and folded it over for transport. “Good, you don’t waste any time.” The man said as he waved for us to lead the way out of the room. We moved in a circle of armed men as we left the house and got into several vans marked with ATF and DEA. I noticed a large group of onlookers, mostly fellow college students and wondered what stories would circulate now. Probably how we were drug dealers or something, since it was the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I did notice that several regular Tempe Police officers were standing guard outside the house as we pulled away. Davey and I were in the back of one of the vans, and once inside we could see nothing. We were alone here, and Davey’s hand found mine, squeezing it tightly. “What do we do now?” He asked me in a scared voice. “I don’t know.” I admitted. “This wasn’t something I’d planned for, really.” “Then you’ll want me to take the lead, eh?” He asked with a little smile. “You’re always saying I think better on my feet.” “You do, love.” I assured him, and part of me actually relaxed a little. Having Davey stepping up to the plate like this, where it would be me leaning on him for a bit was nice. It felt more like the old relationship I’d had with the other Davey, the more experienced Davey. Fifteen minutes later the doors of the van were open, and we got out at the airport. We were in front of the National Guard hangar, and quickly escorted inside. That was where we found the rest of our friends waiting for us. Poor Trevor was still in his football uniform, although he’d managed to ditch his shoulder pads. Brandon had the red and gold paint he’d worn to the game still on his face, as did Todd. Sean was standing with them, talking quietly with them as we arrived. “We brought some clothes for you.” The agent who’d spoken in the house said and I noticed for the first time that a few of the agents had some familiar-looking duffel bags. Trevor let out a sigh of relief, although he looked damn hot in his football uniform. “Took you guys long enough.” Brandon muttered as we joined our friends. “Hey! Your hair is wet! You got to take a shower! That’s not fair!” “Yeah, well, since Brian was plowing my ass when they broke in, I think it’s better we don’t smell like sex.” Davey murmured. “Oh shit, you guys were bumping when they showed up?” Todd laughed while Sean chortled before frowning. “Sorry.” Sean said. “I… I didn’t remember what you guys were doing tonight. Hell, I wasn’t even sure what night it was.” “You came back in time!” Davey exclaimed in a startled voice. “Keep it down.” Sean said quietly. From their reactions, our other friends had already been told. Brandon was giving him a slightly odd look. “Which Sean are you?” I asked quietly with narrowed eyes. “Huh?” Sean asked with a look of confusion. “Are you the Sean from my timeline, this timeline, or another timeline?” I asked him. “I’m the Sean from this timeline, or what was this timeline until I created a new one by coming back.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “The fucking scientist.” Davey growled. “You’re studying physics now so you can get in with him and keep an eye on him. That’s the plan.” “Yeah, and it kind of worked.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “I’m going to go get changed. Wait until I get back. Sean hasn’t told us much more than that.” Trevor said as he headed off. “Excuse me gentlemen.” The agent who’d talked to me before came over to us. He was no longer wearing his ski mask. “There’s a shower facility here if you would like to utilize it before your plane arrives. You will need to be quick, no more than fifteen minutes.” “Hold the explanations, I’m going to get cleaned up.” Brandon said firmly, giving Sean a penetrating look. “I promise.” Sean said softly and then waited until Brandon and Todd followed one of the agents into a side room. “Damn I’d forgotten how suspicious he could be at this age. Jesus, you weren’t lying when you said you could remember everything better after going back, Brian.” “Yes, well I want to know why, scratch that, first I want to know how you did it.” I said firmly. “Sean, the other timeline’s Sean, he swore it would be next to impossible to beat the jamming device.” “From all the stories you’ve told me about time travel, you should know by know that it’s always up to me to come back and save yours and Davey’s butts.” Sean said with a slight smile and then he frowned. “Ouch.” “Are you hurt?” Davey asked in a worried tone. “Not now, but the crystal-clear memory does have a downside.” Sean answered with a frown as he ran a hand along his flat belly. “Getting shot three times really does hurt, and remembering it as clear as day really sucks.” “I can imagine.” I said with a shake of my head. “So, you came back in time…” “I’m not going to say anything until they get back, Brian.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “Brandon is really big on people keeping their promises, remember? I fucked up one time too many and he dumped me ten years ago. I’ve got a chance to fix that and I’m starting now. If I tell him I’m going to do something, I’m damn well going to do it.” “That’s fair.” Davey said with a stern look at me. He didn’t need to give me that look, but neither did I protest. Sean had a good reason. I hadn’t told him about the breakup between Sean and Brandon in my own timeline, but it had been because of something similar. Everyone was back, dressed in casual clothes, and cleaned up by the time a sleek business jet pulled up in front of the hangar. It had Air Force markings, and a Lieutenant Colonel got out as soon as the plane’s door was open. He had a brief discussion with the agent in charge, and we were quickly bustled aboard. “Gentlemen, please take a seat.” The officer said as we entered the fairly well-appointed jet. There were eight seat, and the Lt. Colonel took one near the front after the rest of us were seated and buckled in. “If anyone’s hungry, the steward will prepare a meal as soon as we’re airborne, or you can just have a snack and something to drink. I haven’t been briefed on why you’re flying to Washington, and was given strict instructions to pass along that there should be no discussion of the reason for your flight. We will be met at Andrews by some people from NSA, CIA, FBI, and DoD who will then debrief you.” “Well, there goes the chance at an explanation.” Davey muttered sourly from the seat next to me. I reached out and squeezed his hand while the plane taxied for an immediate take off. Flying across country was never short, but the plane rumbled with the sounds of its engines going at maximum speed the entire way. I was far too nervous to sleep, and did not feel like joining in on the conversation the other guys started up. Apparently Trevor had been pulled off the sidelines where he was waiting his opportunity to get in the game (he was the backup quarterback still) when two police officers had come up and talked to him at the same time as several more officers found the others in the stands. They’d been taken directly to the hangar where Sean was waiting for them, and there had been only a brief opportunity for him to explain he was from the future, our future, before we’d shown up. Something must have gone really, really wrong. My plans had included placing Sean with the scientist who had first invented time travel in order to keep an eye on him. Sean had agreed to this readily. With the jammer in place, it should have looked like the time travel theory was wrong, and the scientist should have been discouraged, or at least his funders should have been discouraged enough to stop funding his experiments. Apparently that had not happened. The entire trip my mind tried to figure out what exactly had gone wrong. Sean was only a few feet away, but I knew better than to try to get him to tell me with the officer so close. He would follow his orders as all good military men do, and would stop any such conversation before it had more than started. There were unmarked vans waiting for us as we landed at Andrews, and I wasn’t surprised that we were being taken to the Pentagon. What exactly had Sean already told them, and more importantly how had he gotten them to believe him so quickly? We all rode in one van, and with a partition between us and the driver, we could at last talk. “So, you’ve got a lot of questions, right?” Sean asked. “In case you haven’t placed the timing right, everyone here knows your role was to be keeping an eye on the crazy scientist.” I stated and he nodded. “Yeah, I figured that.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “They do tend to get jumbled up at first, don’t they? They’re all so clear and fresh. Well, anyway, your plan’s a good one, Brian, as far as it goes. By 2004, the scientist was ready to try his experiments again, and they didn’t work. The Russian guy pulled his funding at first, and the scientist folded up shop. Then two years later he calls me and said he’d made a breakthrough and gotten more funding. I, of course, volunteered to help him out again, except it was a trap.” “A trap?” Davey asked. “Yeah, somehow he’d figured out about the jamming, and he figured out a counter to it.” Sean stated. “Something about the jamming reminded him of some calculations I’d done when I’d worked with him, and he was waiting for me with the Russian, who’d brought a couple of hired thugs with him. Since I’d called you all beforehand, you were waiting outside, ready to storm in and stop things before they went too far. That part didn’t go too well. They were ready to send someone back, and they were just making sure there weren’t other traps. I’m sorry, but they got the truth out of me with some drugs that had me kind of loopy.” “It happens.” I shrugged. “Yeah, well let’s just say the firefight of you guys trying to break in didn’t go too well.” Sean grimaced. “Their thugs were better than us, mostly I guess since none of us really had any military training. Davey did best, wounding the last thug before the guy killed him.” “Ouch.” Davey grimaced. “Yeah, I got hit in the process too.” Sean added, rubbing his stomach again. “So anyway, the scientist went back first as a test. Shevardnadze had a goon assistant who sent him back. When they verified it was successful, the goon sent Shevardnadze back. I was lying there pretty much bleeding to death. They thought I was dead and ignored me. At first, I was just to out of it to really understand what was happening, and by the time I figured out I had to do something, Shevardnadze had gone back. I got the goon with Davey’s gun, and set the time machine on auto before dumping out Shevardnadze’s body and climbing in myself.” “You came back in the middle of class?” I asked with a little confusion. “The machine is supposed to pick a period where you’re asleep…” “I fell asleep in class.” Sean mumbled with a red face. That got all of us to laugh. I seemed to remember Davey having done something similar on one of his trips back in time. “When I woke up, I went right for the nearest phone. I called Mr. Rush like you’d told me, and explained things to him. Somehow he believed me, and more importantly, he got the right people in government to believe him.” “That would make sense.” I said with a look at the surprised Trevor. “He does have many of the right contacts.” “Well, Shevardnadze and the scientist have been back here in time now for three months.” Sean said. “I don’t know for sure if they’ve done anything overt or not, but they could be planning on taking us out.” “How do they know about me?” I asked with a raised eyebrow and Sean ducked his head. “It was one of the things they tricked out of me.” He mumbled as the van pulled to a stop. The door opened a moment later, and a group of soldiers along with a three-star General were waiting for us. Sean and I got out first, and the General frowned at us. “This better not be someone’s idea of a practical joke.” He grumbled to us. “I wish it was.” Sean retorted and the General nodded. “If you will follow me, we’ve got some people waiting inside to have a little chat with the lot of you.” He said in a tone that left no room for argument. Davey squeezed my hand as we followed the senior officer deep into the bowels of the Pentagon. Once again the world had taken a turn for the worse. Could we put it back on the right track? Chapter 20 “I’m tired.” Davey said to me as I entered the medium-sized room that had been hastily turned into sleeping quarters for all of us. Six cot-beds had been arranged with typical military wool blankets and thin pillows. Davey and the others, except Sean, had gotten here first and already the six cots were now arranged in pairs right next to each other. Our bags were at the foot of each set of cots. “So am I.” I said softly, knowing full well our hosts would be listening to every conversation in this room. It was just after two in the morning by the time our interviewers had called a break. Already I’d been through the basic outline of my story, and filled in quite a few details about my plans for this timeline without giving away too many details about the future, or my original timeline. Davey and I sat down on the cots he’d claimed for us while I looked over to where Trevor and Todd were asleep already, and Brandon was half-dozing as he waited for Sean. “Did they say what time they were going to come get us again?” Davey asked around a wide yawn. “Five o’clock for me.” I answered sourly. That was less than three hours away. “Well, let’s get some sleep.” He said as the door opened again and Sean came into the room. Brandon got up and made a beeline for him. They hugged, as Davey and I had, and then chatted quietly before settling down together on their cots. We knew better than to try and trade notes between us. There had always been a possibility that something like this would happen, and we had planned for it in detail. We all knew what to say, and what not to say. Above all, we were always to tell the truth, and if something should not be answered, just refuse to answer it at all. Questions like “Who will win this year’s election?” would be readily answered, while questions about 1992 would receive no comment whatsoever. What the goals of other time travelers were would also be readily answered, but questions about what happens in 2000, or other years would be met with silence. So far, they were going rather easy on us, although the lack of sleep we were going to experience was deliberate. It was precisely five in the morning when we were woken up and taken for a quick breakfast in another room. Then we were shown to a shower that at least helped us wake up a little more before they once again separated us for individual questioning. Some people might have bothered complaining about the treatment, but I knew it was actually rather mild compared to what could be happening right now. “Mr. Breckenridge, please have a seat.” A middle-aged man I had not met before said as I entered the interview room with two soldiers waiting outside as guards. The room had a small table, and six chairs. Five of those chairs were occupied, and I sat in the sixth. None of the men, and they were all men, were those who had questioned me into the early hours of the morning, but I recognized two of them from another timeline. “Mr. Hoskins, Mr. Thornbull, it’s a pleasure to see you.” I said to the two of them and enjoyed the shocked looked on their faces. “You know these men?” the first man who had spoken asked. “Yes, and no.” I said with a slight smile while openly yawning. At least I was twenty now instead of eighty, where the short amount of sleep would have left me stupid with mental fatigue. “I knew them in my previous timeline, but I’ve never met them in the here and now. Mr. Hoskins would have been working in the State Department around this time, if memory serves, and Mr. Thornbull was an expert at the Hungary desk in the CIA.” “Your memory is accurate, Mr. Breckenridge.” The first man said while everyone looked startled while making notes. “Frankly I didn’t know what to believe this morning as I read through the transcripts of your debriefing last night. I trust you got at least some sleep?” “Not enough, but I’ll sleep when there’s more time.” I said with a shrug. “We have a lot of work to do, I believe.” “I am Will Lerner, and I work for the White House.” He said with a nod. “You already know Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Thornbull, and you were right about their current assignments. With Mr. Hoskins from State is Mr. Eldridge, and from the Department of Defense is Mr. Wolfowitz.” “I thought I recognized you, sir.” I said to the last man. Maybe I was more tired than I thought. He was a man I should have recognized, but then again I’d never actually met him in person. “You must imagine how skeptical we all are about what you and Mr. Rule claim to be.” Lerner said carefully. “Still, you have both shared knowledge that should not be known to college students, and given enough examples to lend credibility to your claims. We have some more questions for you this morning.” “Please, I will answer what I can.” I stated. “Good, now why are you refusing to answer certain questions?” Wolfowitz started aggressively, leaning forward as he asked. “Certain questions of a political nature I will refuse to answer.” I shrugged. “I’m not going to see time travel information used for the personal gain of certain individuals.” “But you’ll use it for your own personal gain?” Wolfowitz countered. “Did you not use your knowledge to buy a winning ticket for your… lover’s mother?” “Yes.” I admitted. “Did you not plan to do something similar with an even bigger lottery in the near future?” He continued. “Yes.” I admitted. “So you’ll use your knowledge for your own personal gain, but not for anyone else?” Wolfowitz spoke in clipped tones. “Isn’t that hypocritical?” “Yes, but I’ve never claimed I could not be hypocritical.” I said with a shrug. “But there’s more to it than just financial gain. This country faces issues, and days ahead, that are vastly different than what we are accustomed to facing today. In past timelines, we were ill prepared to adjust our worldview to the new paradigms as they arose. As a result, we stumbled badly in our foreign policy decisions and greatly hurt American interests even though we thought we were doing the right thing. The lottery winnings will be used to help establish a foundation that will hopefully, over the course of several decades, help our country adjust to the changing world and not make the same mistakes. I certainly do not want to see the United States held hostage by foreign nukes planted off our shores, or our soldiers chased out of once-friendly countries.” “And you believe you’re wise enough to make these kinds of decisions?” Lerner asked. “I’ve worked for the United Nations, and the U.S. State Department, as well as on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for most of my adult life.” I replied with a very slight shrug. “For sixty years I was heavily involved in this nation’s foreign relations. For ten years I was the spouse of the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and turned down two direct offers of Ambassadorships for myself. Two different U.S. Presidents asked me to be their Secretary of State, and I refused both times.” “Or so you claim.” Wolfowitz spat out. “We’ve just met, gentlemen, but you will find that nothing I’ve told you so far, or will likely tell you anytime soon is a lie.” I countered. “Proving you’re a time traveler isn’t the easiest thing in the world, nor is knowing how to make the most effective use of information. Sure, it’s possible to change things like who becomes President in a given election, but doing that does not necessarily fix long-term problems. To really fix long-term problems requires a different approach than any real, direct change to the timeline.” “But you are not the only time traveler.” Lerner pointed out. “Not anymore, which is why I’m sharing so much with you now.” I said with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “The Russian time traveler does not have the experience with previous timelines that I have.” “But you claim this is the first time you’ve actually traveled in time.” Hoskins pointed out. “That is true.” I answered. “My husband though, had experienced several different timelines. We were together for around seventy years, and during that time I learned a lot about his experiences. Sean, a different Sean if you will remember, had experienced a similar number of alternate timelines and also contributed to my understanding of the complexities of time travel and changing the future.” “You’ve stated the goal of the Russian time traveler is to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Eldridge spoke up for the first time. “Yes.” I confirmed. “You’ll know better than I how effective we were at changing what happens after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Mr. Shevardnadze was the original funder of time travel that started all of this. His goal then, and I cannot imagine it has changed, was to prop up the Soviet Union and keep it alive past 1991. I would imagine his first steps will be to replace Gorbachev, and to stop the relatively free parliamentary elections in Hungary and Poland early next year.” “Mr. Rule’s debriefing mentioned those events and stated that your efforts to ameliorate the effects of the collapse were less than successful.” Wolfowitz said in a tone of superiority. “I’m still in college, I can’t expect to be able to shift the course of the planet just yet.” I shrugged. “It takes time.” “That’s pretty much what he said.” Lerner noted. “He says that your plans were largely focused on the world after the turn of the century, and even after the first decade of the next century.” “That would be accurate.” I agreed. “My goal isn’t to see any specific person elected or not elected, but to change how we look at the world and our role in the world. Hopefully, people will look at the situation differently, and make different choices, but ultimately it will still be up to them to choose. I will not use my knowledge to force change.” “That is a fine line to walk.” Lerner said with a frown. “Still, you are right about the Soviet time traveler. We are hearing rumblings that a coup is happening as we speak. When we first received Mr. Rule’s strange call, we at first didn’t fully believe it, but we did investigate. Then we started hearing rumblings that something was going on in Moscow, and the agents sent to have a discussion with the scientist Mr. Rule identified encountered him being kidnapped.” “They did?” I stated in surprise, and started to worry as I thought about the timeline where the Chinese had sent assassins after Davey’s family, and mine. That made me really worry. “If they went after him, our families…” “Are under observation and are fine for the present.” Lerner stated. “A massive manhunt is underway at this time. The KGB was forced to use agents from their San Francisco mission, and were easily identified. They are hiding somewhere in the Napa Valley, but we’ll find them and retrieve the scientist. Mr. Rule states that his loyalty to the United States is questionable at best.” “I wouldn’t know for sure, but from what I’ve been told in other timelines, I’d tend to agree with that opinion.” I answered the unspoken question. Lerner noted as he checked something off on his notepad. “How do we counter the moves this Shevardnadze will make?” Hoskins asked after the room had been silent for several moments. “Kill him.” I answered emphatically without hesitation. All four men looked shock at the answer. “In the last timeline, Davey arranged a subterfuge. He convinced President Reagan and his own father that he was a time traveler, and then he convinced them that his young brain couldn’t completely hold the ‘advanced’ knowledge and that he would soon lose it forever. They acted on the information and managed to assassinate all the enemy time travelers before they came back in time, effectively ending their ability to go back into that timeline.” “Doesn’t that create a paradox or something?” Eldridge asked with a pained expression. “The way it was explained to me by another Sean still gives me a headache.” I said honestly and with a bit of sympathy. “Supposedly only one timeline can exist at any given moment, but all the instances of time travel coexist simultaneously, so if a time traveler from 2004 goes back to 1976, he creates a new timeline by any changes he makes, but a time traveler from a previous 2004 still exists and will still arrive in 1981. With enough time travelers, and time lines, it gets very confusing. Sean created this chart that showed all the time travelers and their originating time lines one time. I could recreate it for you, but it doesn’t really help. Why it doesn’t create a paradox I don’t know, but the jamming device we developed in my originating timeline was supposed to stop all other time travel, effectively erasing their ability to affect this timeline. Obviously it failed.” “Yes, it did.” Wolfowitz gloated, but settled down after the other men in the room gave him reproachful looks. “In every time line that Shevardnadze has been allowed to impact, a war has happened that caused huge losses of American life.” I pointed out. “Killing him might prevent that from happening now.” “He has already begun changes in the Soviet Union.” Wolfowitz argued. “Killing him now won’t do any good. We need to stop him from ever coming back. The Rule kid states that he might be able to recreate a time machine and a jamming device.” “That will work.” I agreed instantly. “I could help him with the jamming device.” “Even if it means you won’t be able to come back in time again?” Wolfowitz asked with a gloating expression and I paused for a long moment before meeting his eyes directly. “I’d rather… I’d rather a time line where I did not go back than a timeline altered by Shevardnadze.” I said in a firm voice, but I spoke slowly as if the words pained me greatly. “You know, I almost believe that.” Wolfowitz said after looking at me for another long minute. “Why?” “I’m not selfish enough to put my happiness over the lives of thousands, or millions.” I said with a shrug. “But what about the changes you think need to be made?” Lerner asked. “One thing about history is that it shows us there will always be conflict.” I said with a shrug. “The–the things that happen do cost lives, sometimes even thousands of lives, but none of them are as bad as a possible all-out nuclear war, or a direct war between the Soviet Union and the United States.” “Why is that?” Hoskins asked as he leaned forward slightly with obvious interest. “It’s difficult to believe, but the world really does change tremendously after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” I started carefully. “Twenty years from now, an entire generation will have grown to adulthood who do not remember what it was like for two juggernauts like the United States and USSR to stand opposite each other, both capable of wiping out all life on Earth with one decision. Sure, there are still threats. A city might be nuked, or airplanes might be hijacked and slammed into towers, but a war that ends all life on Earth is a science fiction story usually involving aliens instead of a very real possibility. Kids learn about the Cold War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis and other events and they don’t really understand that all life on Earth really could have ended in the blink of an eye while the Soviet Union and the United States faced off against each other. “Likewise, those of us who lived during the Cold War have a hard time adjusting to a world where the biggest threat to our country is that we might lose a skyscraper, or at worst a single city.” I continued. “We remember the perspective of losing our entire planet, and we subconsciously escalate the threat we face then with the threat we face now. So we react out of proportion to the real threat at hand.” “You say that in the future terrorists manage to strike our cities with nukes?” Wolfowitz asked with a shocked look. “In part because we badly handled the breakup of the Soviet Union, yes.” I confirmed. “Which you are trying to change.” Lerner added. “Yes.” I agreed. “I know on the surface it looks like what I was doing seems solely selfish, and I won’t deny there is a selfish aspect to it, but in the long run it was to be for the betterment of our country, and by extension our world.” “I see.” Lerner nodded. “Thank you for your candor, Mr. Breckenridge. We’ll take a short break for now, and begin again in about an hour, over lunch.” “Thank you for listening.” I said politely as they left the room. A soldier poked his head into the room and I followed him out, back to the room I’d slept in with the others. Sean was there already, as was Davey, although the rest of our friends were gone. “Where’s everyone?” I asked. “Getting a tour.” Davey said with a frown. “I wasn’t invited.” “Why not?” I asked. “For some reason they think I know more than I’m telling.” Davey said with a groan. “They seem to think I’m responsible for all this time travel mess, but it was that other me, wasn’t it?” “You’re right.” I assured him. “It’s not fair.” “Nothing in life is fair.” Sean muttered with a shake of his head. “So, Brian, did they bring up the idea of rebuilding a time machine and another jammer?” “Yes.” I said and Davey let out a groan. “They asked me about it too, like I knew anything!” He moaned. “Still, I told them it was probably for the best, to solve this situation, but that maybe someone should go back just to make sure there wasn’t another time travel device, like you’d planned.” “Which is how I’m here, and we’re all here in the Pentagon instead of in the hospital room.” Sean muttered. “What hospital room?” I asked in alarm and Sean frowned. “I didn’t want to tell the others, but on that night, on the way home from the game, there was an accident.” Sean said sadly. “Todd got hit by a drunk driver while they were walking back, and spent six days in a coma before he died. It was weird seeing him after all these years, but that’s at least one good change, although if we do this plan of building another machine, I don’t know what good it will be in the long run.” “Gentlemen.” A voice called from the doorway and we looked up to see an Army Colonel standing there. “Would you please come with me?” We followed the man through the bowels of the Pentagon and up into the actual halls of the regular portions of the building. Our friends were waiting outside a set of doors that I recognized as leading to the Secretary of Defense’s office, all of them looking a little worried. We waited there, not saying a word until the doors opened and we were escorted inside to find a room mostly empty except for a few Secret Service agents, and the President. “I thought I’d come over here and take a look at you myself.” Ronald Reagan said in a slightly cheerful tone as I stepped forward a pace from my friends and moved to shake his hand. “Mr. President, it’s an honor to meet you.” I said. “My name is Brian Breckenridge. These are my friends.” He shook hands as I introduced each of my friends, and then invited us to sit down in chairs that had been arranged in a circle. He took one of the chairs, and I ended up sitting on his left hand. Sean sat on the other side of him. “I find all this hard to believe, but my people assure me it is genuine.” He said after a moment of silence while we all got settled. “One thing that is bothering me: Why would supposedly smart young men like you be working on the Dukakis campaign?” “He’s a loser, Mr. President.” I said with a chuckle as Davey laughed and gave me a knowing look. “There’s no way he was going to win this campaign, but working on it gave us the start of certain connections that will be needed later on. I hate to tell you this, but Republicans don’t hold on to the oval office forever, and well, the Democrats need a lot more help than the Vice-President.” “They always are in need of help, Mr. Breckenridge.” The President laughed before turning serious. “There appears to be open fighting going on in the Kremlin, and we’re not sure which side is going to come out on top. My advisors tell me that the two of you can make another one of these infernal machines, and put an end to this time travel business once and for all.” “Yes, Mr. President.” Sean said in a slightly awed voice. “I believe the problem was that a frequency was left open for Brian’s transport back. With his help, we can isolate all remaining frequencies and jam those too.” “Are you willing to do this, young man?” He asked me with a very direct gaze. “I understand you have some issues.” “I do, but they pale besides the comparison of a war between the USSR and the USA.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. Davey let out a small whimper that drew his attention. “Do you have a problem with this, Mr. Jones?” The President asked him. “It’s just… my life is better than it would have been without his changes.” Davey said slowly but he shook his head. “Still, put up against a possible war with the Soviet’s, it’d be better for my life to go the way it was than for people to die in a big war.” “I can sympathize with that feeling young man.” The President said with a kindly smile. “I asked myself, just to get an idea of what I was going to be asking you young men to give up, how I would feel if such actions meant I would never be President. In the end, I decided that it would be a price I was willing to pay in order to stop a World War.” “We don’t know a World War is going to happen.” Todd argued and then he blushed when the President turned his attention to him. “What do our two time travelers believe?” President Reagan asked. “There will be a war.” I said at once and Sean nodded his agreement. “If you’re sure about it.” Todd said at last with a sigh. “Now, how long will it take to rebuild this time machine, and what resources will you need?” The President asked us directly and I looked over at Sean, who would be the one doing most of the work. I didn’t know half of what was needed, no, not even a quarter! In the end it took five years to build the machine, and the world was a nightmare. Shevardnadze’s hard-line faction won the shoot-out in the Kremlin, and the Soviet Union was ruled with an iron fist. Protests at the ending of Glasnost and similar Gorbachev programs were brutally crushed, and Hungary never voted out the communists. In 1989, the Berlin Wall never fell, and we came damn close to losing West Berlin itself. The scientist who had invented the time machine was never found, until a CIA agent caught wind of him in Moscow during the final days of 1989. Our agents couldn’t get anywhere near Shevardnadze, but they managed to poison the scientist before he could build another machine for the Soviets. The expected response, a KGB attack on Sean and his family only succeeded in killing Sean’s father. Sean shrugged it off as ‘no big deal’. There was an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, but this time it was backed by the full might of the Soviet Union. Thanks to information we had given our government, and the focused efforts of our intelligence agencies, the Iraqis and Soviets had a little surprise as Iraqi troops barely paused to consolidate Kuwait before pushing into Saudi Arabia. An entire carrier battle group surged into the Gulf, and its planes began bombing the Iraqi troops as soon as they were outside the city of Kuwait. American fighters surged from Germany (after being refueled by planes staged in Israel and Saudi Arabia) engaged Iraq’s air force, slaughtering them in a great air-to-air battle that lasted for twelve hours. It took nearly two weeks for two Marine Amphibious groups to arrive, and by then most of Iraq’s armor in the area had been crushed. The US Marines landed in Kuwait with enough force, and complete air coverage, and the remaining Iraqi troops fled Kuwait like rats from a sinking ship. The Soviet Union, with a bloody nose, pulled back for a little while, licking its wounds while the KGB fomented problems for us in South America. In 1992, George H. W. Bush easily won reelection in a Cold War that wasn’t quite so cold anymore. By the end of 1993, we were conducting our first tests with the new machine. The truth was that Sean was right about me. When it came to the theory behind time travel and its operations, or actually putting it together, I couldn’t help much. However, when it came to operating the machine, or the new ‘jamming’ device, figuring which frequencies, and similar things, I ended up being a lot of help. Poor Davey, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd were stuck being with us, acting as moral support most of the time, although each of them helped in their own way. Todd and Brandon helped with different aspects of the computer components or software, working with the experts the government had assigned us as if they had already completed a full college education in their specific fields. Since they spent the first two years of the project going to classes at Georgetown, that was pretty much the case. Trevor helped in other ways, by helping relieve tension when it built up too high, or asking really basic questions when we were stuck, forcing us to think again in much simpler terms. (He called them stupid questions, but they were far from stupid and helped us solve several problems.) Together, all of us made an impressive team, and when the machine was ready for testing, the military took precautions, but did not deny us all a place in the chamber where the machine was waiting. “You understand, no time travelers.” Roger Sazar, the President’s point man on this project said while we waited for the airlock to cycle. We were actually located in a remote facility in the backwoods of Virginia. This was the bunker built for members of Congress in case of nuclear attack, and had everything needed for our experiments. We had a good, strong, dependable power supply, plenty of food and water, and most importantly in the eyes of the government, hundreds of soldiers to make sure no one went back in time. Our mission was simple, power up the machine, activate the jammer that would keep me, and the others, from going back in time, and then wait to make sure the outside world survived. We had plenty of antennas and other equipment that would allow us to monitor the outside world for a long time before we shut down the bubble and ended our own existence. “We understand.” I repeated for my friends one last time as the huge airlock door, nearly five feet of reinforced steel and concrete swung open. Sean and I led the way in, barely looking at the MRI-type machine surrounded by twenty armed soldiers. Davey and the rest followed us into the control room where a bank of control machines waited for us, and a thick glass window allowed us to monitor events in the machine room. There were more soldiers standing guard in here, and two Generals who nodded at us as we entered. “General Crowley, are we ready to begin?” I asked. As head of the scientific team, I was to have the honor of actually giving the orders, but he was here to countermand anything I might do to stop events. Sure, I’d said I was willing to suffer the consequences, but the government was making sure. “You may proceed.” He said as the airlock door closed with a thud. The room was sealed, and my ears popped as it pressurized to prevent any form of attack from outside. We knew the Soviets had gotten wind of our program, and my knowledge of the timeline where they used nukes in an attempt to stop Davey from going back again warned us that if they knew we were acting today, there would be nuclear war. “Power her up.” I said with a nod to Davey. All of my friends had roles to play today, at the controls of the machine. Sure, we admitted it could be operated with fewer people, but the more hands on deck today, the more likely we could succeed. “Um, General, you might want those soldiers to stand further away from the machine.” Sean said with a bit of muffled laughter. “Why is that, son?” The General asked with a frown. “The machine is a Magnetic Resonance Imager, General.” Trevor reminded him. “It creates a very high-power magnetic field that will…oops, too late.” There was a great clatter, and muffled curses coming from the machine room as soldiers lost bits of metal, and their weapons to the magnetic field of the machine. The equipment flew across the room and attached itself to the machine, and the soldiers cursed as they tried to retrieve their gear. “Damn it!” The General cursed as he turned to the other soldiers in the room. “Go help them. No! Leave your gear here! Can you shut the machine down?” “Begin reducing power to the machine, gradually.” I ordered and Sean began moving a lever on the controls as the remaining soldiers in our control room dropped their weapons, and every bit of metal on their body before heading into the other room to help their comrades. It was a shame really, they were just following orders but it was necessary. “What’s happening?” General Crowley asked as the door between the control room and the machine room closed. “We’ve got a breach in the coolant system!” Todd’s voice sounded alarmed and the two Generals and Sazar, the only men in the room besides my friends, rushed to the control panel and looked out the window to where the soldiers were now choking as some gas spewed from the machine. “Get them out of there!” Sazar shouted, looking around the control panel frantically. “Sorry.” Brandon murmured as he, Davey, and Trevor turned around with small stun guns in their hands. All three men received several shocks before they passed out. Then they were tied up, gagged, and sedated with some drugs from a military first aid kit that would guarantee they would not wake up for a while. Outside the last of the soldiers had succumbed to the gas. “I feel…dirty.” Todd murmured as we looked out at the collapsed soldiers. “None of them should be dead.” Davey murmured softly. “C’mon, we’ve got to clean up in there.” Everyone except Sean and I left the control room after the gas was vented from the other room, and the door opened. The machine was powered down just long enough to remove all the weapons and gear attracted to it, and the collapsed soldiers from locations near the machine. Then it was powered up again to full power. “How much power do we have?” I asked Sean who smiled happily. “More than enough.” He answered. “Let’s get this show on the road then.” I replied and went out to the main room, where Davey kissed me before helping me onto the machine’s platform. He handled the needle himself, and kissed me one last time before my eyes closed and I prepared for another trip back in time. Chapter 21 I opened my eyes and smiled at the sight of my old bedroom. Sunlight was just peaking in through the drapes, and I could clearly make out the football and wrestling posters on the walls, the comforter Mom had changed out when I’d reached fourteen, and the older, smaller dresser I’d had until I entered high school. Yep, I’d come back for a third childhood, and the preliminary evidence showed we’d hit it around the right timeframe. I got out of bed slowly, knowing from the last experience it would take a moment to get accustomed to the younger body. Certainly it felt weird being several inches shorter, and about forty pounds lighter, without quite as much muscle buildup as I had in my early twenties. My morning woody was a little different as well, a little smaller, and a lot more sensitive than I remembered it being even at twenty. After turning on the room light, I got a good glance at the calendar and smiled at the pile of books on my desk while the brand new backpack sat on the chair, waiting to be loaded. Yep, it was the first day of seventh grade, and I’d stayed up late last night getting ready, but not loading my backpack until the morning. “Brian!” Mom’s voice was accompanied by a knock. “You better get a move on or you’re going to be late for your first day!” “I’m up mom!” I shouted back, surprised at how my voice cracked right in the middle of that. Oh yeah, I wasn’t out of puberty yet. I’d been spared that particular curse, for the most part, the last time I’d gone back, but as I began to wake up a little more, I could feel how… unbalanced things felt inside of me. This was going to be weird. “What do you want for breakfast?” She yelled back, and I opened the door, forgetting I was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers and that the front of them was tented a bit. She gave me a look that almost made me blush. “Sorry, pancakes would be nice.” I said with a slight smile and she nodded before moving towards the kitchen while shaking her head. For my part, I grabbed a towel from the hall closet and went to take a shower. It was nice being home, and I felt so relaxed as I cleaned up, and took care of the morning business while wondering what Davey was going to look like at this age. Sure, I could call up a memory, but that had been a different Davey. I was going to get to see the original twelve-year old Davey. “Are you excited, honey?” Mom asked me twenty minutes later after I’d dressed in a new pair of jeans, a nice blue button-down shirt with a sleeveless checkered sweater over it, and my loaded backpack was sitting on the floor next to me as I ate breakfast. “You wouldn’t believe how excited I am.” I told her as Dad came into the room, dressed for work. “Morning Dad!” “Morning Brian.” Dad said with a slight smile. “Oh, I don’t know, I can remember the first time I went to Junior High.” Mom said with a wide smile. “Just don’t forget to say hello to your aunt.” “I won’t.” I groaned playfully and she laughed softly. Fifteen minutes later we were walking outside, towards her car, and I remembered why I’d almost been late on the first day of school. “The tires flat!” Mom groaned as she noticed the driver’s side tire. “You’re going to be late for school!” “If you don’t mind getting Dad to change it for you, I can jog and make it to school on time.” I offered and she frowned. “I don’t want you showing up to your first class all sweaty.” She stated. “Don’t worry mom, get dad to fix the tire and I’ll get to school.” I said as I leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek. I still had to stand on my tiptoes to do that. “Okay, but you be careful!” She yelled. It wasn’t that bad of a jog to school, and I passed the familiar faces of Ronna and Jeanette on the way. They looked young, and were happily talking away to each other, but Davey was nowhere in sight with them as he’d been before. How many times had he told me the story about me bumping into him that first time he came back in time? It was a little disappointing to me that he wasn’t there now, but the sight waiting for me at the end of the bike path more than made up for that lack. “Heya, Bri.” Trevor said with a smile as I came to a stop next to him. “Yo Bri, glad you could make it.” Brandon added with a smile, and then turned back to tickle Sean who was too busy giggling to do more than wave. Todd was laughing at their antics from where he stood next to Trevor. His red hair was longer than I remembered, and he looked like a stoner, but otherwise was very much the Todd I remembered. Davey was standing there, on the opposite side of the circle of friends from me, giving me a very welcome smile. It was so hard not to take him in my arms and kiss him right here and now. He was only slightly overweight, and there was a nice-sized pimple on his right cheek, but he was my Davey, and the best part was the Davey looking out at me through those eyes. It wasn’t the twelve-year old, but the slightly older, slightly more mature Davey from the last timeline. The one who’d managed to make it through the challenges of rough teenage years and become a good man. “Looks like we all made it this time.” Davey said softly. “Yup, just like Brian planned.” Todd added. “You come up with good plans, Bri.” Trevor added with a sigh. “So what happens now? We never got enough time where they weren’t listening to go into too many details about what happens when we all get back.” “We’ll discuss it after school, okay?” I offered. “You mean after flag-football practice.” Brandon pointed out. “Well, what are Sean and I going to do while you boys get all hot and sweaty?” Todd asked. “What about me?” Davey pointed out. “I’m not on the team.” “Like hell you’re not.” Trevor snorted. “You’re signing up today.” Brandon said as he got Sean into a headlock and proceeded to give him a noogie. “As for these two, we could use some pretty cheerleaders.” “I’d watch that if I were you.” Sean growled as he slipped out of the headlock and managed to kick the back of Brandon’s knees, sending him to the ground. We all laughed as Brandon looked up in surprise at his boyfriend. “I learned wrestling in the last timeline, remember?” “Yeah, I remember.” Brandon laughed. “Just checking to see if your runt of a body could still get out of it.” “Runt of a body, you really don’t want any do you?” Sean teased him. “Um, about that.” Brandon said and he looked over at me. “Aren’t we like twelve now?”",

Yes, trust Davey to let his anger get the best of him and tell everything, or nearly everything. “I told her.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “I told her that Brian and me had been a couple, as in lovers, that we loved each other. Then I told her that after I heard her talk about Sean that way that I knew she’d never accept us, so I broke things off and started dating girls to make her happy, but that I’d never sleep with any of them because I loved Brian.” “Holy shit.” Todd said with a hint of respect in his voice. “What happened then?” “Heather slapped me.” Davey chuckled but he was on the verge of tears still and he squeezed my hand tightly. “Riley just shook his head and the three of them left before my mom started to tear into me. You know, she has no problem believing I’m a ‘fucking pervert’, but she says I seduced Brian, turned him into a pervert and she’s going to warn Brenda to keep me away from him. Then she kicked me out. Told me to pack my car with stuff and get the fuck out of there. Last I heard, she was on the phone to Nanny and Papa after she called Dad and blamed him for perverting their son.” “Jesus fucking Christ.” Todd muttered while I pulled Davey into me closer. “I’m so sorry, Davey.” I said softly. “It’s not your fault.” Davey said with a sigh. “I don’t know why I thought pretending would fix anything. All it did was make her madder when she found out. I think that’s what she’s so angry about, not that I’m gay so much as the fact that I lied about it to her all this time. Imagine if it had been years and years of my lying to her before she found out.” “Oh believe me, it would have been bad.” I chuckled softly. “The other me tell you about that?” Davey asked and then he looked at Todd for a moment. “You said you told him, right?” “That he’s some weird kind of time-traveler and really a perverted old man in a young body?” Todd asked rhetorically. “Yeah, he told me. I told him he was wasting his second youth. He should be out there screwing everything in sight that he knew would bend over instead of pining after… oh, um, sorry.” “I… I thought the same thing at first.” Davey said with a blush. “Sometimes I wonder if he’d have been better off without me in his life.” “No, never that.” I said with a shudder as I remembered Davey telling me about that life in another timeline. “So, my other self, he told you about her finding out one time?” Davey asked with a little half-smile. “I can tell you later.” I said. “Is it funny?” He asked. “Yes.” I answered. “C’mon Davey, you know your life. Do you think the story would be anything but funny?” “I need to hear it, please?” Davey asked in a needy voice and I had to sigh before giving in to him. I should still be angry at him, part of me said, but I loved him. “It was in the original timeline.” I began to tell him a story of an alternate version of his life. “You’d joined the Navy after dropping out of Downey. Three years later you were in the Gulf War.” “Gulf war?” Todd asked. “Yeah, in 1990 Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq invades Kuwait and we not only stop him there, but kick his ass back to Baghdad.” I answered. “So anyway, on the way back, this ship you were assigned to stopped in Hawaii. You flew your boyfriend, Keith, out to see you there, planning to spend a whole week on that tropical island with him.” “Sounds fun.” Todd murmured a little jealously. “How’d I afford that?” Davey asked. “You saved up a lot of money for him.” I answered with a shrug. “Anyway, two weeks before you pull into Hawaii, you call your mother from Hong Kong. Somehow her and Jenny scraped up enough money to go to Hawaii at the same time you were going to be there.” “They didn’t know at the time, did they?” Davey asked and I grinned. “That sucks.” Todd groaned. “Vacation ruined.” “Yup.” I chuckled. “You spent the week trying to find time to have sex with your boyfriend you haven’t seen in six months. Your sister kept trying to trip him into her bed, and your mom wanted to spend every minute she could with you. Needless to say it was a very frustrating week for everyone. After it was over, you went back to San Diego where you were stationed, and you lived with him.” “That must have been nice.” Davey said wistfully as he relaxed against me. It felt so natural for us to be like this. “I’m sure it was.” I murmured. “Anyway, you were planning this big birthday party for your sister. Your family was all going to come down, and you hired caterers and everything. You told me you got a second job as a bouncer at a bar in order to get enough money to do all this. Then, the night before your sister and mother were to fly down, your mother called. There was another roommate you shared the apartment with besides your boyfriend, and his boyfriend answered the phone. When he told your mom you were at work, she asked for and got the number.” “This doesn’t sound good.” Todd added. “Nope.” Davey agreed, but he was smiling. “Anyway, your mom called the bar, and got the answering machine.” I continued the story. “It said: Hi, you’ve reached Rich’s, the biggest Gay Bar in San Diego…” “Hah!” Todd started laughing while Davey shook his head. “What did she do?” Davey asked. “She left a message.” I chuckled. “She said ‘Tell David Jones Jr. to call his mother this instant!’ It was an hour before he got the message and he rushed to a payphone to call her. The first words out of her mouth were “Are you fucking Keith?” “No, he’s fucking me.” Davey muttered the punch line of his own story from a time he never knew, shocking me. “Well, that’s what I would say.” “That’s what you did say.” I laughed softly and Todd shook his head. “It was months before the two of you ever talked again, but she called Keith each and every night for two weeks.” “I wonder what ever happened to him?” Davey asked. “If I loved him, why wasn’t he around later when…” “I asked about that.” I admitted. “He… he was partying with some guys and flew off to San Francisco with one of them who was really rich, and that was the last that Davey ever saw of him. Two months later, you moved back home with your mother to go back to college. Keith had taken all the money you’d saved up, and you didn’t have enough for rent, and by that time you were out of the Navy.” “That sucks.” Todd shook his head. “I hope I end up with someone like Brian. He’d never do something like that.” “But I would, I did.” Davey said glumly. “Davey, there’s always a room here for you.” I said softly. “I don’t care if we’re talking or not, boyfriends or not, there is always a place here for you. My parents would kill me if I didn’t support that.” “They’re probably as pissed at me as you are.” Davey said miserably. “I certainly hope so.” I said with a laugh and he looked at me like I was insane. “Doofus.” Todd said to him. “You don’t get it, do you? Brian’s saying he’s forgiven you.” “You are?” Davey asked me and I nodded after a moment. “Why?” “Because I love you, and, well, you came right to me after your mother kicked you out.” I said with a shrug. “You got kicked out because you told the truth about you and me, and the only reason to tell the truth would be because you want us to be back together.” “You figured all that out, eh?” Davey asked with a shake of his head. “Yeah, I did.” I acknowledged. “So where do we go now?” Davey asked. “Shit, Heather! It’s going to be all over the school now.” “You never do anything halfway.” Todd said with a grin. “It’s all or nothing with you.” “Shut up.” Davey growled. “My god, we can’t go to school tomorrow! It’s Homecoming!” “We will go, and I’ll be right there with you.” I assured him. “Me too.” Todd added. “Oh, don’t glare at me like that, Davey. I like Brian a lot, maybe too much, but I know a lost cause when I see one. Without you in the picture I might have a chance, but if there’s even a hope of him being with you, he’ll never look at me as more than a friend.” “Damn right about that.” I growled. “Okay, fine, but I’ll be watching you, Todd.” Davey glared at his friend. “Davey, Brian, are you in here?” Mom’s voice announced her arrival, and her worried tone said she’d spoken with Sandy already. “We’re in here!” I half-yelled and she entered the room, stopping as soon as she saw Davey in my arms. “Well, that’s at least one problem solved.” She said and then she looked at Todd with an inquiring look. “I’m pissed that Brian’s not on the market anymore.” Todd said to her with a shrug, which was a little brave of him. He smiled when my mother shook her head at him. “Brian, dear, do you have any boy friends who are actually straight?” Mom asked me with mock exasperation. “Not that I can name off the top of my head, no.” I laughed. “How are you holding up, dear?” Mom asked Davey as she reached the couch and put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m better now than I have been in a long time.” Davey answered with a relieved sound. “I hate to have to ask this but…” “We’ll get your room ready for you later tonight.” Mom said. “Sandy’s still in the yelling mood and won’t listen. I’m going to pick up Bev in the morning and we’re going to tag-team her. You won’t have to stay here for more than a day or two.” “I’m sorry, Mrs. B.” Davey said softly. “It’s Brian you need to apologize to, and those poor girls.” Mom answered him. “The girls?” Davey asked with confusion. “Yes, dear, those girls.” Mom said with a shake of her head. “You’re a smart enough young man to figure out why.” “I used them.” Davey said after a moment. “I led them on, made them believe that more was possible than there really was.” “Yes, dear, you did.” Mom’s tone made her feelings about that crystal clear. “This is not going to be fun.” Davey said with a heavy sigh, causing Mom to chuckle a bit. “Well at least things are back on the right track.” She said with a light tone before looking over at Todd. “You going to stay for dinner?” “I better be getting home.” He said a little reluctantly. “I’ll see you two at school. This is going to be fun.” “God I hope not.” Davey said miserably, but there was a little smile on his face as Todd left the house. “Brian, your father should be home in time for dinner so we’ll fill him in on the day’s events then.” Mom said. “Why don’t you help Davey unload his car? It looks like it’s filled.” “Okay mom.” I said. Davey and I got up then and started to unload his car. He’d packed it mostly with clothes, and a few other odds and ends, which made quite a pile on the bed in the guest room. We were taking in the last load when Dad’s car pulled up in the driveway. Davey and I paused as he got out of his car and looked at the two of us. “Well, this is a surprise.” He said after a moment. “A pleasant one at that. I take it Davey’s finally come to his senses?” “You might say that, and my Mom doesn’t want me around at the moment.” Davey said with a heavy sigh. “Well, why don’t we all head inside and you can fill me in on the details?” Dad said in a kindly tone that seemed to relax Davey a bit. We finished telling the story over dinner, and Dad was just reiterating his support for Davey when there was a banging on the front door. “That would probably be Pete.” Dad said with a wry chuckle as he got up. Sure enough, it was Davey’s grandfather who stormed in the house, glaring at Davey who was looking a little sheepish. “What kind of tomfoolery are you getting yourself into now, boy?” Pete demanded angrily. “Your mother tells me you’ve gone and decided to be a pervert. You know your soul will burn in hell?” “That’s enough of that, Pete.” Mom said sternly. “Don’t give me no lip, Brenda.” Pete half-snarled. “You don’t know the bible. It says…” “Judge not lest ye be judged.” Mom interrupted him, and for the next twenty minutes I learned something about my mother that I had never known before. She held her own against Pete, quoting a bible verse to counter every one he threw at her. Halfway through Pete relaxed from the angry stance he’d had to something more like his normal self. Finally, he just grunted at her. “Well, we’ll know which of us is right on Judgment Day.” He said flatly before turning back to Davey. “You know I don’t approve of this no matter what she says.” “I know.” Davey said in a firm voice. “I don’t tell you how to live your life, though, Papa.” “Damn right you don’t.” Pete groused and then he nodded. “Fine, you’re going to do what you want to do. Just don’t make me ashamed to be related to you.” “I won’t.” Davey said sternly and Pete nodded before turning to leave without saying another word. “I have no idea what that means.” Davey admitted as the door closed behind his grandfather. “It’s a start.” Mom said softly. “Don’t worry Davey. Your family will come around given time. If he didn’t care, he’d not have come here, and he’d not have stayed as long as he did, or left like that.” “I hope you’re right, Mom B.” Davey said with a heavy sigh as he leaned against me. “She is.” I assured him. Chapter 18 I remembered the last timeline quite clearly, and the reactions of Davey’s family to his sexuality. An older, wiser Davey had years and years to prepare them in subtle ways. Sometimes I think he did it almost without even thinking or planning it, just presented his family with ‘learning experiences’ that nudged them in the right direction. Unfortunately, he had none of that in this timeline. He didn’t have the experience of his first disastrous coming out, nor the memories of years of arguments and discussions that had finally led to grudging acceptance. Nor did he have the years of preparation based on those memories. Instead, he just had me, my parents, and his Aunt Bev. As it turns out, Aunt Bev was all he needed anyway. The woman was a force of nature with an indomitable will. According to her family, she’d always been strong-willed, but recovering from the accident that had left her paralyzed from the neck down had transformed her from merely strong-willed to something else, something more. She might not be able to get out of her wheelchair without someone lifting her, but she was more than capable of lifting anyone by the figurative neck and slapping them around verbally until they saw things her way. The first person she set her sights on that night of Davey’s ‘coming out’, was Davey. She grilled him for nearly an hour over the phone, and at times he was angry, blushing from embarrassment, or silent as she let him know what she thought. The second person to benefit from her opinion was me. That conversation was far shorter, and after a few questions that started with “When did you know you were homosexual?”, most of the conversation was her warning me to not hurt her Davey. “I really don’t want to go to school today.” Davey said early the next morning when I went to his room to wake him up for an early morning run. “I think I’m going to be sick.” “Your stomach is all tied up in knots.” I stated flatly and he nodded with a miserable look on his face. “I feel like I’m going to puke.” He really did sound miserable. “You always feel this way when things are like this.” I said with a shrug. “You told me that it just got worse as time went by and you had to learn to ignore it, to just move forward despite the yuckiness. You told me that if you hadn’t learned to do that, you’d have never succeeded in making anything better in your life.” “I hate that me.” He said with a shake of his head before climbing out of bed and stumbling around to get a pair of sweats on. “I bet that me liked getting up early too.” “No, he hated it with a passion.” I laughed. “Good, at least he didn’t go totally crazy.” Davey sighed. “Let’s get the show on the road.” After stretching out, we jogged at an easy pace for two miles. He actually managed a smile on his face when Mom served us breakfast, and we headed out the door a little early for school. Today we both went in my car, and we pulled into the parking lot nearly a half-hour early. “Oh shit.” Davey mumbled as we got out of the car and saw Heather and Riley standing nearby. Heather had a very determined look on her face while Riley looked uncomfortable. His girlfriend was nowhere to be seen, which I couldn’t decide if that was good or bad. As they walked towards us, I watched Davey take in a deep breath before letting it out slowly. “Well?” Heather said in a stern voice as she crossed her arms and stopped just a foot away from Davey. “I’m sorry.” Davey blurted out and managed to look surprised at his own words. Heather cocked her head to the side and raised an eyebrow but otherwise remained silent, obviously waiting for more. “I’m sorry for misleading you, Heather. You’re a good person. Bright, funny, and very beautiful and you deserve to be treated better than I treated you.” “Oh, I don’t know.” Heather said sarcastically. “You treated me pretty good except for the whole making me think you were interested in me thing.” “I do like you, as a friend.” Davey said defensively. “I almost… I almost wish things were different so I could really be interested in you that way, but I’m not and it was wrong of me to lead you on.” “So you really are queer?” Riley said in a neutral tone and then he looked at me with a very direct look. “You and him both.” “Yes.” Davey said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. “Why?” Heather asked. “Why what?” Davey responded. “Why did you go out with me, and the others as well if you knew you were queer and obviously have nothing against it.” Heather asked. “It was my mother.” Davey said with a heavy sigh and he put everything on the table, although he didn’t mention Sean’s name. While he left that out, he told just about everything else in about fifteen minutes. People walked by us while he talked, but something about how we were standing kept them from approaching, even Brandon and Trevor who arrived just before Davey finished. “I accept your apology.” Heather said when he was done while Riley stood there shaking his head. “I don’t quite understand why you’re queer and don’t have a problem with it, but at least you’re man enough to stand up for yourself. I won’t say anything to anybody, on one condition.” “What’s that?” Davey asked. “Homecoming is tonight.” Heather said with a steely gaze. “We made plans.” “I know.” Davey said softly. “Good.” She said firmly. “You’re going to carry through with them. After tonight, you and I will break up, but for the rest of today we’re still a couple. Anyone have any problems with that?” “No.” Davey and I said in unison while Riley shook his head. “What about you, Riley?” Heather asked. “You got any problems keeping quiet about this stuff if Davey follows through with tonight?” “I don’t understand this whole queer thing, but I’ll keep my mouth shut as long as you don’t try anything with me.” Riley said quietly. “Good, now Davey, put your arm around me and walk me to class.” Heather commanded with a questioningly look at me. I just smiled and waited for them to move off. When they were gone, Riley stayed put, giving me a searching gaze. “You know, I’d have never thought you were a queer.” He said with a disbelieving shake of his head. “Then again, after that shit you went through with Marcie, I might have given up on girls altogether too.” “Yeah, well, it’s a little more complicated than that.” I said with a shrug. “You going to be okay?” “Yeah, I’ll be fine.” He said before walking off. As soon as he was gone, I was swarmed by Trevor and Brandon, who had hooked up with Sean and Todd. Everyone wanted to know what was going on, and when they heard that it sounded like we weren’t going to be outed to the entire school, they all looked a little relieved. As expected, Heather won Homecoming Queen, and Davey was King. She seemed to be very happy with the day’s events, and the fact that we won the game that night made it even better. What was best of all was the fact that she kept her promise, as did Riley (and his girlfriend). There was no public outing for us at Downey that year, although there were whispers and by the time baseball season rolled around, we were pretty sure everyone guessed that Davey and I were a couple. No one brought it out in the open though, and as long as we didn’t do anything too public, it seemed like people were fine with leaving it as just a rumor. I heard a few rumors about Sean and Brandon towards the end of the year, and even I was surprised about Todd and Trevor. The two of them somehow became thick as thieves, and by the time of Davey’s eighteenth birthday it was readily apparent they were a couple. Davey’s family more than made up for the lack of drama at school. Frantic middle-of-the-night calls from an angry Sandy woke all of us up several times until Mom took the phone off the hook. In November, Davey’s father stepped into the mix, at Sandy’s request, and the fireworks really exploded between father and son. We all did what we could to support Davey, but he would fluctuate between being overly happy and depressed. It was after Thanksgiving that things really came to a head. Both of Davey’s parents insisted that he get ‘counseling’ at a local church. Davey kept refusing, and his parents pulled the law into the fight. They reported him as a runaway, and we got a visit from the local police department one night. Legally there was nothing we could do immediately, and Davey left with the two officers who took him back to his mother’s house where his parents were waiting with the pastor of the church offering counseling for ‘troubled youth’. The next morning, both Mom and Beverly ‘quit’ working for Sandy. Dad, at my urging, called the local Social Services department and a figure familiar to me made a visit to Davey’s home, just in time to see the action. After Davey had rudely rebuffed the efforts of the pastor the night before, the man had convinced Sandy to order Davey committed for ‘treatment’ as a ‘rebellious, out of control teenager’. They made up all sorts of things about drug and alcohol abuse, that might have been true two years ago, but were not true now. Mary Lou Hacker walked in just as three burly men were attempting to subdue Davey and get him into a van that would take him to the ‘treatment center’ in another state. Sean, having been subjected to a similar treatment by his own parents had done more than enough to warn Davey, who fought as hard as he could. Mary Lou, hearing screaming and shouting, had entered the house and immediately called the police to come and sort things out. It was Pete who entered the scene and ended the chaos of that day. Sandy had called her mother in tears and the two of them had driven over immediately. By this time the police had arrived and Mary Lou was trying to figure out exactly what was going on there. Pete walked into the house while Monta went right to Sandy who was crying. Mary Lou, a shrewd judge of people, immediately focused on him. “Who are you?” She asked Pete. “I’m Sandy’s father.” Pete said gruffly as he eyed the woman. “Who are you?” “I’m Mary Lou Hacker, with Social Services.” She said and then quickly explained how she’d gotten involved. “Those idiots.” Pete grumbled at once, giving a glance over to where Sandy and David Sr. were sitting. Davey’s father looked offended, but stayed silent. “If the boy’s a queer, he’s a queer. Trying to beat it out of him ain’t gonna do no good.” “What do you mean?” Mary Lou asked him sharply. “The complaint is that he’s been rebellious, drinking, using drugs, and running away from home.” “Hah!” Pete laughed. “Sandy told the boy to get the hell out of her house when he told her he was a queer and he’s been staying with some good people since then. Hellfire, one of them works for Sandy!” “Not no more she doesn’t.” Sandy interjected at that point with an angry tone. “Your loss, girl.” Pete told her with no sympathy. “I’ll admit Davey had a little spell with drugs and alcohol a couple of years back and I was mighty worried about him, but since he met up with this new group of friends he’s finally gotten his life put back together, even if he’s decided he’s a queer. Hell, I can live with him being a queer if it means he ain’t going to piss his life away. There’s worse things in this world than fudgepackers.” That last he said with a glare at Davey’s father. “You’re saying he’s not a runaway?” Mary Lou asked Pete. “That’s what I said, lady.” Pete grumbled, hating to have to repeat himself. “As far as you know he hasn’t been using alcohol or drugs?” She pushed further. “Well, I know he’s had a beer when we go fishing, but just one.” Pete admitted gruffly. “Once in a while we’ll have some wine with dinner at Brian’s.” Davey added, gambling that honesty would win him more points rather than get him in trouble. “That’s definitely not alcohol abuse.” Mary Lou said with a sigh. “Now, what’s this about him being gay?” “I am gay.” Davey said sharply. “They don’t like that and they’ve been insisting I see this Christian counselor. They made up all the other shit so they could commit me the same as Sean’s parents did to him.” “Sean Rule?” Mary Lou asked with a sharp look at Davey. “Do you know him?” “He’s a friend of mine.” Davey said simply and she nodded. “The boy is lying.” The Pastor of First Baptist broke in at that point but he got a stony stare from Mary Lou in response and eventually closed his mouth. “Mr. Barrow, in your opinion is there any need for Davey to be committed?” Mary Lou asked his grandfather. “Hell no.” Pete said firmly. “Do you think you might be able to take him in while his case is reviewed by Social Services and he’s seen by a professional?” She asked. “Wait a minute!” Sandy exploded. “There’s no need for that.” Pete shook his head. “The boy has himself some good people to stay with where he has his own bedroom, which he wouldn’t have at my place. What’s more, he’s got money in a trust fund that Sandy set up, and she named me as the trustee on it so she can’t cut him off.” Sandy didn’t even bother trying to protest against her father. She just started crying again. Mary Lou took all that in, before nodding and suggesting that Pete call these ‘people’ so she could talk to them. An hour later, Davey was back at home, and I was holding him while he cried. We were all lucky that day. Somehow it stayed out of the local papers, and outside of the families involved, no one seemed to know what happened (except for our friends, of course). Davey was less than two months away from his eighteenth birthday, and so he got a lot of leeway that Social Services wouldn’t have been able to give him otherwise. It was the week before Christmas before Davey spoke to his parents again. Bev and Pete had harangued everyone until they had all agreed to apologize to Davey. What’s more, Bev had talked them into family counseling, with a counselor recommended by Mary Lou. By the end of the school year, they had all changed in some surprising ways. In February, Davey moved back in with his mother, at the same time that his father was invited to move into the home. Jenny had been the one to make the final call on that decision, and while she would forever be affected by what had happened to her, the family counseling had done a lot to heal her of the worst affects. She was a lot closer to the young woman I remembered her being than when I first had arrived in this timeline. High School Graduation came around far sooner than I had ever imagined possible. Davey and I celebrated together, along with our friends at a private party. The next day we spent a lot of time saying goodbye to our families in the typical teary-eyed farewells that happen when kids finally grow up and set off on their own. It was my father who drove us to San Francisco where we boarded a plane that took us on a two-hour flight. Todd, Sean, Brandon, and Trevor would all be following us to the same school, but they weren’t coming until later. Davey had insisted we share everything with them, and all of them had demanded they wanted to be a part of our plans. Trevor had turned down the USC scholarship and instead gotten one for ASU. Sean had qualified for several academic scholarships, as did Todd. Davey’s father, who was becoming more like the man I’d known as time passed and he mellowed out, was overjoyed that his son would be going to Arizona State University. The man had been born and raised in Phoenix, and was already planning a trip out to visit. Luckily he wasn’t planning on staying with us. With all of us pitching in together, we were more than able to afford an off-campus house. Truth be told, Davey and I could have afforded it by ourselves, but with all the others coming, there was no reason not to share. Together we leased a four-bedroom home that was six blocks from campus, and Davey’s mother had helped us furnish it. Her business had nearly collapsed when Mom and Bev quit, and I think at least some of the reconciliation with Davey had been to get those two women back to work with her. She’d been lonely without their company, and although she hated to admit it, she needed them far more than they needed the work. “Jesus it’s hot!” Davey murmured as we walked out of the air-conditioned baggage claim area. The heat hit us like a brick wall, and both of us immediately started sweating. I’d been to Phoenix a few times in the last timeline, mostly to visit Trevor and his family, but I’d never gotten use to this heat. “Just wait.” I mumbled. “It gets worse.” “Why the hell are we going to school here instead of somewhere colder?” Davey muttered as we hailed a taxi. Instead of answering I just gave him a withering glare and he had the grace to shrug off his own question. Fifteen minutes later we were at our new house, a fairly nice two-story home, and we unloaded our bags in the room that would be ours. “I bet our air-conditioning bills are going to be horrible.” Davey complained as the air conditioner brought the house down to a reasonable temperature. “Just during the summer, and it’ll only be the two of us most summers.” I reminded him. “Do you really think I can cram in enough classes to graduate in three years?” He asked me with a worried look. “If we both study hard, we can.” I assured him. “It will mean that we won’t be able to party as much as everyone else.” “You mean we won’t have as many opportunities to get in trouble.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “No thanks. With my luck I’d get drunk off my ass and thirty years later someone will come up with pictures of me puking on the sidewalk. I can live without all that shit.” “Glad to hear that.” I said with a smile. “As long as you and I get to fuck like bunnies.” He leered at me. “We’ve got an hour before we have to be on campus.” I reminded him. “You want to break the bed in?” “Let’s.” Davey said with a grin. We made it on-time, barely, to the special orientation the school had set up for the few freshmen who were getting an early start to their college education. It was a Saturday, and we had most of the afternoon to look around the school and surrounding area. On Sunday, we spent several hours on the phone to family and friends back in California, most of whom thought we were crazy for going to summer school. Then on Monday, we started our first day of classes. That summer wasn’t easy on either one of us. We had selected our courses for that first semester with great care. I had been through college before, and could remember what a difference it was from high school. In high school, much of the work was memorization of facts, dates, information, etc. with very little ‘opinion’ thrown in the mix. College was more about the ‘why’ and the ‘how’. That was why our first courses were the introductory political science course necessary for our major (International Relations) and the six-week intensive Russian Language course. ASU had one of the best Russian language courses in the nation, and many of their students were recruited by the U.S. State Department for work in their embassies and other facilities. The NSA also recruited heavily from the school, another reason for why I picked that school for undergraduate work. In many ways, it was better for what we wanted than the bigger-name Ivy League schools with more prestigious programs. After the first summer session, Davey was about ready to tear his hair out, and even I was tired. Still, we signed up for another intensive language course for the second summer session, which would put us a full year ahead in the foreign language requirements. We didn’t take any other course, and so by the time our one-week break between the second summer session and Fall semester arrived, we were both only half-crazy. Trevor showed up by himself several weeks into the second summer session for his football training camp, and complained non-stop about the heat. Davey’s parents, and his sister showed up for that one-week break, and we spent the entire time following his father around to all of his old haunts. The home he’d grown up in was now an apartment complex, but his school was still there. It was odd seeing his parents back as a couple, but both of them seemed happier. His father had used some of his wife’s lottery money to open up a rental car company in Modesto. Instead of focusing on just the rental car market, he also rented larger trucks and multi-purpose vehicles. After just a few months, he was already in negotiations to open franchises in three other towns in California. Jenny talked about going to ASU, but I had a feeling she was really thinking about going somewhere else for college. My parents made it out for the weekend, along with Brandon, Sean, and Todd. It was nice having our friends around again, although the late August thunderstorms put a damper on our sightseeing both Saturday and Sunday. Davey and I knew to do our runs very early in the morning, when the temperature might get down to a cool ninety degrees. Trevor did too, and we all laughed the one time our roommates tried to go running as late as eight in the morning when the temperature was inching into the mid-nineties and above. The first day of the regular semester started early for both Davey and me. Davey had an eight o’clock three-day a week political science course while I had a math course at the same time. Then there was an hour break for us before our five-day a week Russian 201 course. This was an important one, mostly because of the instructor, Professor Lee. The Professor was a tall man with a wild shock of white hair that still had a few streaks of brown in it. We actually had him for two courses, the grammar-focused 201 course, and the culture/speaking focused 211 course. He was also the professor for a two-day a week course on Soviet History that we were taking. It was part of the Soviet Studies Certificate that was highly prized by the U.S. State Department in potential employees. “Brian, and David, please stay after class for a moment.” He told us in Russian towards the end of the 201 course. After the bell rang, we waited and he nodded briefly to us. “I do not normally see freshmen in this course.” “We took the summer course.” Davey replied to the statement in the language it had been spoken in, Russian. His accent was still off, and the phrasing a bit clunky, but it sufficed. “Do you speak?” Professor Lee asked me. “Of course.” I replied, using the word konyechna. He smiled before grilling us for a few minutes to make sure we really did have a decent grasp of the language. “You will do fine.” He said with approval in English. “What other courses are you taking this semester?” “We are in your 211 course.” Davey answered. “And the Soviet History course as well.” I added. “How interesting.” He said in Russian before switching back to English. “Are you going to major in Russian?” “International Relations with the certificate in Soviet Studies”. Davey answered. “I’ll probably take all four years of language though.” “Same with you?” He asked me and I shook my head. “I’m majoring in Economics with a minor in Russian and of course the Soviet Studies.” I answered. He cocked his head. “Interesting choice.” He said. “Why?” “I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think that within five years the Soviet Union will no longer exist.” I stated in English with a shrug. He just blinked. “What gives you that idea?” He asked slowly and carefully, as if speaking to someone he was worried might go crazy at the drop of a hat. “Gorbachev’s reforms are a starting point.” Davey began our argument. He and I had been over this time and again over the last year. Oddly, it was our favorite topic after sex, and we’d spent a lot of time lying in bed, the room smelling like sex, and discussed the end of the Cold War. “He’s playing with fire in a forest that hasn’t seen a drop of rain in seventy years. Sure, he’s dug a fire pit, ringed it with stones, and is trying to clear away any nearby underbrush, but he doesn’t realize that all it’s going to take are a few gusts of wind and a few sparks, and there’s going to be a forest fire so big nothing can stop it from burning down the forest of communism.” “Nice alliteration.” The Professor said with a slight smile. It was a good alliteration. Davey always had a way with words. “I think it will start in the Eastern European Republics.” I added. “Most likely it’ll be Poland that starts the ball rolling. Solidarity is gaining in strength, even if it is still mostly underground and being supported by the CIA and the Catholic Church. From there it’ll probably head to Hungary, and eventually to Germany. That will really be the death knell of communism, if Germany can reunite.” “Hard-line communists in Russia will probably try to stop it from happening, maybe even try to take down Gorbachev.” Davey added. “But, it’ll be too late.” “That’s what we think, at least.” I said with a shrug. “If you think this, why are you studying Russian and the Soviet Union?” The Professor asked. “If you’re right, any careers you might have planned will not really be needed.” “Russia, and the former communist states will need to adjust to a post-communist form of governing.” I said with aplomb. “They’ll need to learn the basics of a capitalist economy, and they’ll want advice. There will be plenty of opportunities for work, and for making money.” “I think I’m going to enjoy having you two in my classes.” He said after shaking his head. “Maybe we’ll find a few holes to poke in your theories. The Soviet Union has been around a long time, and they’ve gone through periods of reform before. I’ll want you to pay close attention to the sections between Lenin and Stalin, and the Khrushchev years.” “Thank you.” I said with a nod of my head while Davey smiled at him. We talked for a few more minutes before heading out for lunch. Todd was shaking his head after his first lessons in Arabic. Sean was babbling about something from his physics class, Trevor talked about football, and Brandon was mostly silent. Of all of us, his courses in Computer Science were the least developed at this school, and he could have done a lot better by going somewhere else, but this was the school that seemed to allow us all the best opportunity to attend as a group. Our first year in school was tiring for all of us. While no one else was taking eighteen units like Davey and I were, we all had a great deal of focus on our studies. Trevor, Brandon, and Todd attended a few parties, and Trevor was offered to pledge one of the fraternities, but he turned them down. Because we were all in fairly steady relationships, we did a lot less partying than most freshmen, and were slower in making new friends. That wasn’t to say we didn’t have new friends. Of all of us, Trevor was in the most delicate situation. He played ASU football, and they were a team that got a lot of attention. There was intense pressure on him to have a girlfriend, but he quietly refused and people quickly began to realize what was up when they always saw him in Todd’s company. One of the coaches even pulled Trevor aside and made a few ‘suggestions’ that Trevor didn’t even pause to consider. “You’ll never be picked up professionally if you don’t at least play that game.” The Coach warned him. Since I remembered Trevor as having fallen in love, gotten married and having kids with a woman, I was surprised by how he stuck with Todd. Not that it was a bad thing. It was just unexpected. “You know, I could dump Todd and date women, maybe even get married.” Trevor said after he’d come back from that meeting with one of the coaches. We were alone in the house, since Davey and the others had all gone out to see a movie. I’d stayed behind to re-work an essay for my English Lit course. Having lived a whole lifetime already didn’t necessarily provide any assistance when it came to writing this damn essay, and Trevor wanting to talk was a good diversion. “Why don’t you?” I asked him. “I know you’ve always dreamed of being in the NFL, and it’ll be next to impossible if you don’t at least appear to be hetero.” “Do you think I should?” He asked me with a raised eyebrow. “Are you happy with Todd?” I asked him. “I mean, you know most high school romances don’t last forever.” “Look at Davey’s parents.” Trevor countered with a shrug. “His mom married his dad right out of high school, and then he went and did all that shit. Now they’re back together and planning their re-marriage during winter break. Look at my parents. They met in college and they’re still together.” “But do you think that you and Todd have what it takes to last that long?” I asked him. “The last timeline, you and Davey lasted that long, didn’t you?” He asked me. “Yes.” I agreed. “Do you think the two of you will last that long again?” He asked. “I mean, for you it’s going to be two lifetimes with the same man. Don’t you get bored?” “No.” I said emphatically. “I could never get bored with Davey.” “I don’t think I could get bored with Todd, either.” Trevor stated. “He’s fun to be with, and we’re constantly doing things together. He loves football, or at least watching it, and we both love music. There are so many things we have in common, and some things we don’t. It’s like we fit together.” “Okay, if it makes you happy, then I say go for it and damn the consequences.” I told him with a smile. “You know, I think that might have had something to do with me coming back in time. I was looking at the end. Davey was probably already dead, and we’d had such good times together that I didn’t want it to end. So I came back to start over again, to have another lifetime with him.” “Kind of selfish, huh?” Trevor said with a smile. “You say you came back to save the world, but you really came back just to be young enough to pork Davey for another sixty years.” “I’ve been caught at last!” I laughed and we both chuckled before he went to find something to do while I went back to that damn essay. Was I really that selfish? Well, maybe I was, but then a part of me believed that Davey had come back over and over again for me, so why shouldn’t I come back for him? Chapter 19 “Remind me why we’re doing this again?” Davey asked with a heavy sigh as we sat down for lunch. It was a little restaurant just off of Indian School Road, and we both were tired, sweaty, and hungry. We managed to get a sneer from the waiter when he saw the t-shirts we were wearing, but he took our order just the same. “Because it’s important to build the right connections from the beginning.” I reminded him as the waiter left. “You know I support the other guy, right?” He leaned in and whispered with a conspiratorial smile. “Even after all the crap that I told you about in other timelines?” I asked him and he frowned before shaking his head. “I don’t believe I’m really a Democrat.” Davey muttered for the fiftieth time. “Wait until 1992.” I assured him and he shook his head again. Sure, Dukakis lost, and he lost big, and here in Arizona he was wildly unpopular, but working on the campaign built up credibility for later. Davey and I weren’t talking in the fall of 1986, so he hadn’t worked with me on the California gubernatorial election, but I’d been there with bells on. “I know, I know.” Davey said with a sigh. Walking precincts was the basic level of work, along with phone banking, and we were doing both for the doomed Dukakis for President campaign. It helped build credibility for things I wanted to happen down the road, and in Arizona, along with a few thousand dollars in contributions from our trust funds, it had gotten us delegate positions to the national Dem convention this year. Todd and Trevor showed up before we ordered, and they both griped at me for talking them into this. Brandon and Sean both were phone banking today, and probably getting nasty comments and hang-ups, just like we were getting doors slammed in our faces. Four years from now it’d be a totally different story, but this was the here and now, and besides we likely wouldn’t be in Arizona then. After lunch, it was back into the one hundred plus degree heat for more precinct walking. Sure, it was late September, but the heat lingered here well into October sometimes. It was days like this one that made me think I’d picked the wrong school. Dinner reaffirmed my having made the right choice, though, as we showed up at Professor Lee’s house. It was a private dinner, with some of his fellow professors, two graduate students, and then Davey and I. While we were technically in our second ‘year’ of attending college, both Davey and I had accumulated enough credits that we were on the border between Sophomore and Junior status. It wasn’t exactly easy going on either of us. Davey had nearly had a mental breakdown over the summer, and so we’d taken a lighter load for the second half of summer. The truth was I needed that lighter class load too. Then, instead of visiting family in Modesto, we’d taken off for Hawaii and spent nearly two weeks there before the fall semester started. We’d returned a little more tanned, and a lot more relaxed. After dinner, we were sitting around Professor Lee’s living room, sipping cognac and discussing some of the finer points of Stalin’s Five-Year Plan when the Professor got around to the purpose of the dinner. It wasn’t the first dinner we’d been to at his house, and we were always the only undergraduates there, although he had thrown a big party at the end of the year for all of his Russian language students. He had these dinners at least once a month, though. The difference was that he’d just hosted one two weeks ago. “Brian, Davey, I hope you remember the discussion we had when you first came to Arizona State about what you see as the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union.” Professor Lee began, and there was actually a few giggles from the graduate students. “Yes, Professor.” I said while Davey cautiously nodded. “You two did a joint report for me last year where you provided some good supporting facts.” Professor Vikten, a wrinkled, bald man in his late sixties added with a nod towards us. “You had quite a lot of interesting facts in there that I have never seen added up quite that way before. It was either a work of genius or sheer stupidity.” That got more giggles, and a few chuckles from the other professors in the room while Davey blushed and I tried not to laugh. Knowing the Soviet Union was going to collapse, and why it did from evidence after its fall was one thing. Trying to find the evidence to point to it beforehand, without talking about time travel, or having access to classified information was even more difficult. Thankfully the library here kept up to date on a lot of periodicals that had the information we needed for the paper. “I hope you thought it was genius because we both got an A on it.” I finally said after getting the urge to laugh under control. This time there was a lot more open laughter. “Yes, whether it was right or wrong, it was well researched and well written.” He praised us, and from him it was high praise. “It was well written enough that it formed the core of a grant request that we submitted over the summer.” Professor Lee added and this time I was surprised. I had not expected that. “The grant has been approved, and we are forming the research group that will work on the grant. All the people here tonight have expertise in the areas we need, and the idea came from the two of you. I took the liberty of submitting your names to the government already, and the preliminary security clearances were approved for both of you, despite, um well I believe we do not need to go into that.” That did surprise me a bit. It wasn’t until Bill Clinton took office that the rules were changed regarding gay people having security clearances. In this time, merely being gay usually classified someone as a security risk and they would not be given any sort of security clearance by the government. Some strings must have been pulled on this, and it showed I had indeed picked the right school. “We’re going to be studying the economic conditions in Eastern Europe with a focus on how it might bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Davey asked in the silence that followed. “Are you sure we can contribute to that?” “You’re both four-oh students, this was your idea to begin with, and your research papers have shown you know how to conduct proper research.” Professor Vikten said bluntly. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you both were graduate students already. You will of course receive a small stipend, not that either of you need it from what I hear, and you will receive course credit for your work, as upper-division credit. Is it correct that you’re both only taking eighteen units this semester?” “Only eighteen?” One of the graduate students gasped. “That’s right.” I confirmed. “It was getting a little bit much for us over the summer so we decided to lighten the load a bit. It’ll mean graduating after summer school in ’91 instead of Spring ’91, but it’s better than having a breakdown.” “Yes, it is.” Vikten agreed. “Do you think you can handle the extra work if you join us on the grant team?” “We can.” Davey said excitedly. I nodded my agreement. “Good, then let’s start talking details.” Professor Lee said as he finished off his drink and started into the details of what the grant covered, and what each person’s role would be. Honestly, it was more than I could have hoped for, although some of the preliminary conclusions would come too late, I knew, at least it’d be on record that we were part of the team predicting the fall of the Soviet Union when it actually collapsed. A problem cropped up the next week though, when two FBI agents interviewed Davey and me separately. In my interview, it quickly became apparent that the agent didn’t like gay people, and didn’t believe either of us should have a security clearance of any type. Most of the information we would have access to was economic in nature, not military, but it still was sensitive information. “You’re a homosexual.” The agent, a middle-aged man in a dark suit said as he sat across from me at a small table. He looked unpleasant in the extreme. “Yes.” I answered simply and honestly. “Homosexuals can’t be trusted with government secrets.” He stated succinctly and started to stand up. “Why not?” I asked him calmly and he looked at me with a little surprise at the challenge to his statement. “You’re too easy to blackmail.” He grunted. “Blackmail?” I laughed softly. “What is there to blackmail me about?” “The communists could threaten to reveal your perversion publicly.” He said sourly. “Hmmm.” I said while tapping my finger on my chin. “Who would they threaten to reveal it to that would scare me? I just told you, an FBI agent, that I was gay. My parents know. My friends know. My professors know, and many students I go to classes with know or at least suspect. They could shout it from the rooftops, take an ad out in the New York Times, or announce it on television for all I care. How can they use it to blackmail me when I don’t care who knows?” “They could seduce you.” He said flatly. “They could seduce anyone.” I pointed out. “It’s a constant threat, isn’t it? That someone with sensitive information will fall into bed with an agent and give up everything they know for love. Sorry, but I already have someone I love. We’re in a relationship together, and we have been for years. I’m not going to risk that for some random romp in the hay no matter how cute the guy might be.” “It’s easy to say that, but reality is different.” He said. “You’re a guy, a guy who sleeps with other guys. Fidelity isn’t in your nature.” “You don’t know me well enough to say that.” I snapped. “You’re married, and you’re a guy. Aren’t you a risk because some pretty woman might try to seduce you? That happens all the time in this country, you know. Married men cheating on their spouses.” “Don’t try to switch this back on me.” He fumed, but he looked like he was at least thinking. “The purpose of an investigation for a security clearance is to determine if the person will be a risk, right?” I asked him in a neutral tone. “It’s your job to find out as much about me as you can to help you decide if I will reveal classified information to people who should not have it.” “Your explanation is a little simplistic.” He said, but he wasn’t hostile. “How thorough have you been?” I asked him with a raised eyebrow. “What about that bitch, Marcie? Do you have that incident in my file?” “Your ex-girlfriend who tried to trap you into marrying her.” He grumbled. “So you’re not really a homosexual, are you?” “More bi-sexual, but I’m in a homosexual relationship and never plan to leave that relationship.” I shrugged. “I don’t get how you can just blabber about being a pervert.” He grumbled. “You know, I could arrest you for violating the sodomy laws here in this state. How can I give someone who is knowingly breaking state law a security clearance?” “Can the FBI arrest me for violating a state law?” I asked him. “Well I can have you arrested by a state trooper.” He corrected. “The Supreme Court just upheld sodomy laws in Texas a few years ago.” “Yes, I know.” I smiled. “Um, have I admitted to having sexual intercourse in violation of the law?” “You’ve said you were a homosexual.” He stated. “But did I admit to any sexual activity while in the state of Arizona?” I pushed. “No.” He frowned. “So you can’t have me arrested for violating state sodomy laws when I haven’t admitted to violating them.” I pointed out. “Just being gay doesn’t mean I have to have sex here in this state. Davey and I could drive across the border to California if we want and it’s perfectly legal there.” “This is getting us nowhere.” He groused. “No it isn’t.” I agreed. “If you believe I’m a security risk, deny me clearance. All I ask is that you base it on a real judgment about me, not because you believe I’m a pervert. Which I disagree with, by the way.” “Fine.” He grumbled. Davey’s interview went much the same as mine, except Davey really tore into his agent who got decidedly uncomfortable at a few things. My lover’s luck was with him as always, and he had been able to guess the man was a closet case. He’d used that mercilessly to rake the poor agent over the coals without flat out saying he was sure the man was a closet case. The next day word came down that we had received our clearances. Normally we would have gone to the game that night and cheered our school’s team on (and Trevor), but Davey and I wanted a private celebration. I cooked a romantic dinner for two, and we ate over a candlelit table. These moments were important for both of us, because they helped keep our relationship as more than simple friendship. Sean hadn’t gone either since he had a class tonight. After dinner, we put the plates in the dishwasher and moved upstairs to our room, the master bedroom for the house. We had moved Davey’s king-size waterbed out here, and on nights like this one, I was glad I’d insisted we get one of the new wave-less water mattresses. We must have spent a good half-hour doing nothing more than kissing and slowly undressing each other, covering each other’s bodies with our hands and our mouths. Making love with Davey was always different. Sometimes it was quick and dirty, and other times, like tonight it was slow and sensual. We’d achieved another victory, overcoming the homophobic prejudices of the FBI agents, and that made our lovemaking all the sweeter. An hour after we’d begun, I was buried deep inside Davey, his legs over my shoulders, and he was leaning up so we could kiss while I fucked him with long, slow strokes. Everything was so perfect, and that was when the door to our bedroom flew open. We were playing Davey’s radio, one of Asia’s albums in case Sean came home after class and so we hadn’t heard the noises of the black-clad officers entering our house. Until they surrounded us with weapons drawn and pointed at us, we didn’t even know they were in the house. “What the fuck?” Davey yelled at the interruption, and I felt a moment of fear. Had the FBI agents set this up so they could try and get a prosecution of us under the state’s sodomy laws? Would the state even bother prosecuting it since it could result in bad publicity. “Uh, you both need to get dressed.” One of the officers in the black swat gear, his face hidden by a ski mask and his helmet, said in a voice that almost sounded like he was on the verge of laughing. “What’s going on here?” I demanded as I pulled out of Davey. Already I’d gone soft, but I made no move to cover myself. I’d be damned if I’d let these motherfuckers think I was ashamed. “You need to come with us, immediately.” The same officer said in a slightly calmer voice. “Are you arresting us?” Davey demanded as he raised himself up on his elbows and glared at them. “On what charge?” “You’re not under arrest.” The agent said as he signaled with his hands for the other men to leave the room. A few of them were snickering, and one was muttering something that sounded a little disgusted, but that was all. “We’re actually here for your protection, by order of the President of the United States.” “What?” Davey exclaimed in surprise while I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I immediately suspected that somehow, our secret had gotten out. With a sigh I nodded at the officer. “Can you give us a moment to get dressed?” I asked him. “I’m not supposed to let either of you out of my sight.” He said with amusement in his voice. “How much time do we have?” I asked him, trying to think quickly. “Could we take a quick shower so we don’t smell wherever we’re going?” “As long as you leave the bathroom door open and don’t take too long.” He said after thinking for a moment. “C’mon Davey.” I said to my lover. “We’ll shower together to save time.” “Okay.” Davey said in a shaky voice as we got off the bed and headed into the bathroom, leaving the door open. As the hot water gave us a little privacy, I leaned in to whisper to him. “I think somehow they know about time travel.” I whispered. “No shit.” Davey murmured. “What else would get us this much attention? The shit in Eastern Europe doesn’t happen for several more months. How could they know and how in hell do they even believe it?” “We’ll probably find out soon enough.” I said. “We don’t have all night.” The officer called from the doorway, and we finished the shower in a hurry. When we were both dry and headed over to the dresser to pull out some underwear, he spoke again. “You might want to dress comfortably and pack a bag or two with some nicer clothes in them. It’s a little cold where you’re going.” “Where are we going?” Davey asked as he slipped on a pair of red bikini briefs I had bought for him. He looked so damn good in them. “Let’s just say back east.” The officer said with a shrug. “There’s a plane flying in to Sky Harbor right now to pick you and the others up at the National Guard hangar.” “Can we leave a note for our roommates?” I asked as I pulled on a pair of white briefs and a t-shirt. Davey was already pulling out white socks, dress socks, extra t-shirts, and our ties. I went over to the closet and pulled out two pairs of jeans, some polo shirts, and two light jackets that we almost never used here in Arizona. We were dressed quickly, and while Davey packed the small clothes in to a duffel bag, I put some dress clothes into a garment bag. “There’s no need for that.” The officer said. “You almost done?” “We’re done.” Davey said as I zipped up the garment bag and folded it over for transport. “Good, you don’t waste any time.” The man said as he waved for us to lead the way out of the room. We moved in a circle of armed men as we left the house and got into several vans marked with ATF and DEA. I noticed a large group of onlookers, mostly fellow college students and wondered what stories would circulate now. Probably how we were drug dealers or something, since it was the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I did notice that several regular Tempe Police officers were standing guard outside the house as we pulled away. Davey and I were in the back of one of the vans, and once inside we could see nothing. We were alone here, and Davey’s hand found mine, squeezing it tightly. “What do we do now?” He asked me in a scared voice. “I don’t know.” I admitted. “This wasn’t something I’d planned for, really.” “Then you’ll want me to take the lead, eh?” He asked with a little smile. “You’re always saying I think better on my feet.” “You do, love.” I assured him, and part of me actually relaxed a little. Having Davey stepping up to the plate like this, where it would be me leaning on him for a bit was nice. It felt more like the old relationship I’d had with the other Davey, the more experienced Davey. Fifteen minutes later the doors of the van were open, and we got out at the airport. We were in front of the National Guard hangar, and quickly escorted inside. That was where we found the rest of our friends waiting for us. Poor Trevor was still in his football uniform, although he’d managed to ditch his shoulder pads. Brandon had the red and gold paint he’d worn to the game still on his face, as did Todd. Sean was standing with them, talking quietly with them as we arrived. “We brought some clothes for you.” The agent who’d spoken in the house said and I noticed for the first time that a few of the agents had some familiar-looking duffel bags. Trevor let out a sigh of relief, although he looked damn hot in his football uniform. “Took you guys long enough.” Brandon muttered as we joined our friends. “Hey! Your hair is wet! You got to take a shower! That’s not fair!” “Yeah, well, since Brian was plowing my ass when they broke in, I think it’s better we don’t smell like sex.” Davey murmured. “Oh shit, you guys were bumping when they showed up?” Todd laughed while Sean chortled before frowning. “Sorry.” Sean said. “I… I didn’t remember what you guys were doing tonight. Hell, I wasn’t even sure what night it was.” “You came back in time!” Davey exclaimed in a startled voice. “Keep it down.” Sean said quietly. From their reactions, our other friends had already been told. Brandon was giving him a slightly odd look. “Which Sean are you?” I asked quietly with narrowed eyes. “Huh?” Sean asked with a look of confusion. “Are you the Sean from my timeline, this timeline, or another timeline?” I asked him. “I’m the Sean from this timeline, or what was this timeline until I created a new one by coming back.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “The fucking scientist.” Davey growled. “You’re studying physics now so you can get in with him and keep an eye on him. That’s the plan.” “Yeah, and it kind of worked.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “I’m going to go get changed. Wait until I get back. Sean hasn’t told us much more than that.” Trevor said as he headed off. “Excuse me gentlemen.” The agent who’d talked to me before came over to us. He was no longer wearing his ski mask. “There’s a shower facility here if you would like to utilize it before your plane arrives. You will need to be quick, no more than fifteen minutes.” “Hold the explanations, I’m going to get cleaned up.” Brandon said firmly, giving Sean a penetrating look. “I promise.” Sean said softly and then waited until Brandon and Todd followed one of the agents into a side room. “Damn I’d forgotten how suspicious he could be at this age. Jesus, you weren’t lying when you said you could remember everything better after going back, Brian.” “Yes, well I want to know why, scratch that, first I want to know how you did it.” I said firmly. “Sean, the other timeline’s Sean, he swore it would be next to impossible to beat the jamming device.” “From all the stories you’ve told me about time travel, you should know by know that it’s always up to me to come back and save yours and Davey’s butts.” Sean said with a slight smile and then he frowned. “Ouch.” “Are you hurt?” Davey asked in a worried tone. “Not now, but the crystal-clear memory does have a downside.” Sean answered with a frown as he ran a hand along his flat belly. “Getting shot three times really does hurt, and remembering it as clear as day really sucks.” “I can imagine.” I said with a shake of my head. “So, you came back in time…” “I’m not going to say anything until they get back, Brian.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “Brandon is really big on people keeping their promises, remember? I fucked up one time too many and he dumped me ten years ago. I’ve got a chance to fix that and I’m starting now. If I tell him I’m going to do something, I’m damn well going to do it.” “That’s fair.” Davey said with a stern look at me. He didn’t need to give me that look, but neither did I protest. Sean had a good reason. I hadn’t told him about the breakup between Sean and Brandon in my own timeline, but it had been because of something similar. Everyone was back, dressed in casual clothes, and cleaned up by the time a sleek business jet pulled up in front of the hangar. It had Air Force markings, and a Lieutenant Colonel got out as soon as the plane’s door was open. He had a brief discussion with the agent in charge, and we were quickly bustled aboard. “Gentlemen, please take a seat.” The officer said as we entered the fairly well-appointed jet. There were eight seat, and the Lt. Colonel took one near the front after the rest of us were seated and buckled in. “If anyone’s hungry, the steward will prepare a meal as soon as we’re airborne, or you can just have a snack and something to drink. I haven’t been briefed on why you’re flying to Washington, and was given strict instructions to pass along that there should be no discussion of the reason for your flight. We will be met at Andrews by some people from NSA, CIA, FBI, and DoD who will then debrief you.” “Well, there goes the chance at an explanation.” Davey muttered sourly from the seat next to me. I reached out and squeezed his hand while the plane taxied for an immediate take off. Flying across country was never short, but the plane rumbled with the sounds of its engines going at maximum speed the entire way. I was far too nervous to sleep, and did not feel like joining in on the conversation the other guys started up. Apparently Trevor had been pulled off the sidelines where he was waiting his opportunity to get in the game (he was the backup quarterback still) when two police officers had come up and talked to him at the same time as several more officers found the others in the stands. They’d been taken directly to the hangar where Sean was waiting for them, and there had been only a brief opportunity for him to explain he was from the future, our future, before we’d shown up. Something must have gone really, really wrong. My plans had included placing Sean with the scientist who had first invented time travel in order to keep an eye on him. Sean had agreed to this readily. With the jammer in place, it should have looked like the time travel theory was wrong, and the scientist should have been discouraged, or at least his funders should have been discouraged enough to stop funding his experiments. Apparently that had not happened. The entire trip my mind tried to figure out what exactly had gone wrong. Sean was only a few feet away, but I knew better than to try to get him to tell me with the officer so close. He would follow his orders as all good military men do, and would stop any such conversation before it had more than started. There were unmarked vans waiting for us as we landed at Andrews, and I wasn’t surprised that we were being taken to the Pentagon. What exactly had Sean already told them, and more importantly how had he gotten them to believe him so quickly? We all rode in one van, and with a partition between us and the driver, we could at last talk. “So, you’ve got a lot of questions, right?” Sean asked. “In case you haven’t placed the timing right, everyone here knows your role was to be keeping an eye on the crazy scientist.” I stated and he nodded. “Yeah, I figured that.” Sean said with a shake of his head. “They do tend to get jumbled up at first, don’t they? They’re all so clear and fresh. Well, anyway, your plan’s a good one, Brian, as far as it goes. By 2004, the scientist was ready to try his experiments again, and they didn’t work. The Russian guy pulled his funding at first, and the scientist folded up shop. Then two years later he calls me and said he’d made a breakthrough and gotten more funding. I, of course, volunteered to help him out again, except it was a trap.” “A trap?” Davey asked. “Yeah, somehow he’d figured out about the jamming, and he figured out a counter to it.” Sean stated. “Something about the jamming reminded him of some calculations I’d done when I’d worked with him, and he was waiting for me with the Russian, who’d brought a couple of hired thugs with him. Since I’d called you all beforehand, you were waiting outside, ready to storm in and stop things before they went too far. That part didn’t go too well. They were ready to send someone back, and they were just making sure there weren’t other traps. I’m sorry, but they got the truth out of me with some drugs that had me kind of loopy.” “It happens.” I shrugged. “Yeah, well let’s just say the firefight of you guys trying to break in didn’t go too well.” Sean grimaced. “Their thugs were better than us, mostly I guess since none of us really had any military training. Davey did best, wounding the last thug before the guy killed him.” “Ouch.” Davey grimaced. “Yeah, I got hit in the process too.” Sean added, rubbing his stomach again. “So anyway, the scientist went back first as a test. Shevardnadze had a goon assistant who sent him back. When they verified it was successful, the goon sent Shevardnadze back. I was lying there pretty much bleeding to death. They thought I was dead and ignored me. At first, I was just to out of it to really understand what was happening, and by the time I figured out I had to do something, Shevardnadze had gone back. I got the goon with Davey’s gun, and set the time machine on auto before dumping out Shevardnadze’s body and climbing in myself.” “You came back in the middle of class?” I asked with a little confusion. “The machine is supposed to pick a period where you’re asleep…” “I fell asleep in class.” Sean mumbled with a red face. That got all of us to laugh. I seemed to remember Davey having done something similar on one of his trips back in time. “When I woke up, I went right for the nearest phone. I called Mr. Rush like you’d told me, and explained things to him. Somehow he believed me, and more importantly, he got the right people in government to believe him.” “That would make sense.” I said with a look at the surprised Trevor. “He does have many of the right contacts.” “Well, Shevardnadze and the scientist have been back here in time now for three months.” Sean said. “I don’t know for sure if they’ve done anything overt or not, but they could be planning on taking us out.” “How do they know about me?” I asked with a raised eyebrow and Sean ducked his head. “It was one of the things they tricked out of me.” He mumbled as the van pulled to a stop. The door opened a moment later, and a group of soldiers along with a three-star General were waiting for us. Sean and I got out first, and the General frowned at us. “This better not be someone’s idea of a practical joke.” He grumbled to us. “I wish it was.” Sean retorted and the General nodded. “If you will follow me, we’ve got some people waiting inside to have a little chat with the lot of you.” He said in a tone that left no room for argument. Davey squeezed my hand as we followed the senior officer deep into the bowels of the Pentagon. Once again the world had taken a turn for the worse. Could we put it back on the right track? Chapter 20 “I’m tired.” Davey said to me as I entered the medium-sized room that had been hastily turned into sleeping quarters for all of us. Six cot-beds had been arranged with typical military wool blankets and thin pillows. Davey and the others, except Sean, had gotten here first and already the six cots were now arranged in pairs right next to each other. Our bags were at the foot of each set of cots. “So am I.” I said softly, knowing full well our hosts would be listening to every conversation in this room. It was just after two in the morning by the time our interviewers had called a break. Already I’d been through the basic outline of my story, and filled in quite a few details about my plans for this timeline without giving away too many details about the future, or my original timeline. Davey and I sat down on the cots he’d claimed for us while I looked over to where Trevor and Todd were asleep already, and Brandon was half-dozing as he waited for Sean. “Did they say what time they were going to come get us again?” Davey asked around a wide yawn. “Five o’clock for me.” I answered sourly. That was less than three hours away. “Well, let’s get some sleep.” He said as the door opened again and Sean came into the room. Brandon got up and made a beeline for him. They hugged, as Davey and I had, and then chatted quietly before settling down together on their cots. We knew better than to try and trade notes between us. There had always been a possibility that something like this would happen, and we had planned for it in detail. We all knew what to say, and what not to say. Above all, we were always to tell the truth, and if something should not be answered, just refuse to answer it at all. Questions like “Who will win this year’s election?” would be readily answered, while questions about 1992 would receive no comment whatsoever. What the goals of other time travelers were would also be readily answered, but questions about what happens in 2000, or other years would be met with silence. So far, they were going rather easy on us, although the lack of sleep we were going to experience was deliberate. It was precisely five in the morning when we were woken up and taken for a quick breakfast in another room. Then we were shown to a shower that at least helped us wake up a little more before they once again separated us for individual questioning. Some people might have bothered complaining about the treatment, but I knew it was actually rather mild compared to what could be happening right now. “Mr. Breckenridge, please have a seat.” A middle-aged man I had not met before said as I entered the interview room with two soldiers waiting outside as guards. The room had a small table, and six chairs. Five of those chairs were occupied, and I sat in the sixth. None of the men, and they were all men, were those who had questioned me into the early hours of the morning, but I recognized two of them from another timeline. “Mr. Hoskins, Mr. Thornbull, it’s a pleasure to see you.” I said to the two of them and enjoyed the shocked looked on their faces. “You know these men?” the first man who had spoken asked. “Yes, and no.” I said with a slight smile while openly yawning. At least I was twenty now instead of eighty, where the short amount of sleep would have left me stupid with mental fatigue. “I knew them in my previous timeline, but I’ve never met them in the here and now. Mr. Hoskins would have been working in the State Department around this time, if memory serves, and Mr. Thornbull was an expert at the Hungary desk in the CIA.” “Your memory is accurate, Mr. Breckenridge.” The first man said while everyone looked startled while making notes. “Frankly I didn’t know what to believe this morning as I read through the transcripts of your debriefing last night. I trust you got at least some sleep?” “Not enough, but I’ll sleep when there’s more time.” I said with a shrug. “We have a lot of work to do, I believe.” “I am Will Lerner, and I work for the White House.” He said with a nod. “You already know Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Thornbull, and you were right about their current assignments. With Mr. Hoskins from State is Mr. Eldridge, and from the Department of Defense is Mr. Wolfowitz.” “I thought I recognized you, sir.” I said to the last man. Maybe I was more tired than I thought. He was a man I should have recognized, but then again I’d never actually met him in person. “You must imagine how skeptical we all are about what you and Mr. Rule claim to be.” Lerner said carefully. “Still, you have both shared knowledge that should not be known to college students, and given enough examples to lend credibility to your claims. We have some more questions for you this morning.” “Please, I will answer what I can.” I stated. “Good, now why are you refusing to answer certain questions?” Wolfowitz started aggressively, leaning forward as he asked. “Certain questions of a political nature I will refuse to answer.” I shrugged. “I’m not going to see time travel information used for the personal gain of certain individuals.” “But you’ll use it for your own personal gain?” Wolfowitz countered. “Did you not use your knowledge to buy a winning ticket for your… lover’s mother?” “Yes.” I admitted. “Did you not plan to do something similar with an even bigger lottery in the near future?” He continued. “Yes.” I admitted. “So you’ll use your knowledge for your own personal gain, but not for anyone else?” Wolfowitz spoke in clipped tones. “Isn’t that hypocritical?” “Yes, but I’ve never claimed I could not be hypocritical.” I said with a shrug. “But there’s more to it than just financial gain. This country faces issues, and days ahead, that are vastly different than what we are accustomed to facing today. In past timelines, we were ill prepared to adjust our worldview to the new paradigms as they arose. As a result, we stumbled badly in our foreign policy decisions and greatly hurt American interests even though we thought we were doing the right thing. The lottery winnings will be used to help establish a foundation that will hopefully, over the course of several decades, help our country adjust to the changing world and not make the same mistakes. I certainly do not want to see the United States held hostage by foreign nukes planted off our shores, or our soldiers chased out of once-friendly countries.” “And you believe you’re wise enough to make these kinds of decisions?” Lerner asked. “I’ve worked for the United Nations, and the U.S. State Department, as well as on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for most of my adult life.” I replied with a very slight shrug. “For sixty years I was heavily involved in this nation’s foreign relations. For ten years I was the spouse of the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and turned down two direct offers of Ambassadorships for myself. Two different U.S. Presidents asked me to be their Secretary of State, and I refused both times.” “Or so you claim.” Wolfowitz spat out. “We’ve just met, gentlemen, but you will find that nothing I’ve told you so far, or will likely tell you anytime soon is a lie.” I countered. “Proving you’re a time traveler isn’t the easiest thing in the world, nor is knowing how to make the most effective use of information. Sure, it’s possible to change things like who becomes President in a given election, but doing that does not necessarily fix long-term problems. To really fix long-term problems requires a different approach than any real, direct change to the timeline.” “But you are not the only time traveler.” Lerner pointed out. “Not anymore, which is why I’m sharing so much with you now.” I said with a slight shrug of my shoulders. “The Russian time traveler does not have the experience with previous timelines that I have.” “But you claim this is the first time you’ve actually traveled in time.” Hoskins pointed out. “That is true.” I answered. “My husband though, had experienced several different timelines. We were together for around seventy years, and during that time I learned a lot about his experiences. Sean, a different Sean if you will remember, had experienced a similar number of alternate timelines and also contributed to my understanding of the complexities of time travel and changing the future.” “You’ve stated the goal of the Russian time traveler is to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union?” Eldridge spoke up for the first time. “Yes.” I confirmed. “You’ll know better than I how effective we were at changing what happens after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Mr. Shevardnadze was the original funder of time travel that started all of this. His goal then, and I cannot imagine it has changed, was to prop up the Soviet Union and keep it alive past 1991. I would imagine his first steps will be to replace Gorbachev, and to stop the relatively free parliamentary elections in Hungary and Poland early next year.” “Mr. Rule’s debriefing mentioned those events and stated that your efforts to ameliorate the effects of the collapse were less than successful.” Wolfowitz said in a tone of superiority. “I’m still in college, I can’t expect to be able to shift the course of the planet just yet.” I shrugged. “It takes time.” “That’s pretty much what he said.” Lerner noted. “He says that your plans were largely focused on the world after the turn of the century, and even after the first decade of the next century.” “That would be accurate.” I agreed. “My goal isn’t to see any specific person elected or not elected, but to change how we look at the world and our role in the world. Hopefully, people will look at the situation differently, and make different choices, but ultimately it will still be up to them to choose. I will not use my knowledge to force change.” “That is a fine line to walk.” Lerner said with a frown. “Still, you are right about the Soviet time traveler. We are hearing rumblings that a coup is happening as we speak. When we first received Mr. Rule’s strange call, we at first didn’t fully believe it, but we did investigate. Then we started hearing rumblings that something was going on in Moscow, and the agents sent to have a discussion with the scientist Mr. Rule identified encountered him being kidnapped.” “They did?” I stated in surprise, and started to worry as I thought about the timeline where the Chinese had sent assassins after Davey’s family, and mine. That made me really worry. “If they went after him, our families…” “Are under observation and are fine for the present.” Lerner stated. “A massive manhunt is underway at this time. The KGB was forced to use agents from their San Francisco mission, and were easily identified. They are hiding somewhere in the Napa Valley, but we’ll find them and retrieve the scientist. Mr. Rule states that his loyalty to the United States is questionable at best.” “I wouldn’t know for sure, but from what I’ve been told in other timelines, I’d tend to agree with that opinion.” I answered the unspoken question. Lerner noted as he checked something off on his notepad. “How do we counter the moves this Shevardnadze will make?” Hoskins asked after the room had been silent for several moments. “Kill him.” I answered emphatically without hesitation. All four men looked shock at the answer. “In the last timeline, Davey arranged a subterfuge. He convinced President Reagan and his own father that he was a time traveler, and then he convinced them that his young brain couldn’t completely hold the ‘advanced’ knowledge and that he would soon lose it forever. They acted on the information and managed to assassinate all the enemy time travelers before they came back in time, effectively ending their ability to go back into that timeline.” “Doesn’t that create a paradox or something?” Eldridge asked with a pained expression. “The way it was explained to me by another Sean still gives me a headache.” I said honestly and with a bit of sympathy. “Supposedly only one timeline can exist at any given moment, but all the instances of time travel coexist simultaneously, so if a time traveler from 2004 goes back to 1976, he creates a new timeline by any changes he makes, but a time traveler from a previous 2004 still exists and will still arrive in 1981. With enough time travelers, and time lines, it gets very confusing. Sean created this chart that showed all the time travelers and their originating time lines one time. I could recreate it for you, but it doesn’t really help. Why it doesn’t create a paradox I don’t know, but the jamming device we developed in my originating timeline was supposed to stop all other time travel, effectively erasing their ability to affect this timeline. Obviously it failed.” “Yes, it did.” Wolfowitz gloated, but settled down after the other men in the room gave him reproachful looks. “In every time line that Shevardnadze has been allowed to impact, a war has happened that caused huge losses of American life.” I pointed out. “Killing him might prevent that from happening now.” “He has already begun changes in the Soviet Union.” Wolfowitz argued. “Killing him now won’t do any good. We need to stop him from ever coming back. The Rule kid states that he might be able to recreate a time machine and a jamming device.” “That will work.” I agreed instantly. “I could help him with the jamming device.” “Even if it means you won’t be able to come back in time again?” Wolfowitz asked with a gloating expression and I paused for a long moment before meeting his eyes directly. “I’d rather… I’d rather a time line where I did not go back than a timeline altered by Shevardnadze.” I said in a firm voice, but I spoke slowly as if the words pained me greatly. “You know, I almost believe that.” Wolfowitz said after looking at me for another long minute. “Why?” “I’m not selfish enough to put my happiness over the lives of thousands, or millions.” I said with a shrug. “But what about the changes you think need to be made?” Lerner asked. “One thing about history is that it shows us there will always be conflict.” I said with a shrug. “The–the things that happen do cost lives, sometimes even thousands of lives, but none of them are as bad as a possible all-out nuclear war, or a direct war between the Soviet Union and the United States.” “Why is that?” Hoskins asked as he leaned forward slightly with obvious interest. “It’s difficult to believe, but the world really does change tremendously after the collapse of the Soviet Union.” I started carefully. “Twenty years from now, an entire generation will have grown to adulthood who do not remember what it was like for two juggernauts like the United States and USSR to stand opposite each other, both capable of wiping out all life on Earth with one decision. Sure, there are still threats. A city might be nuked, or airplanes might be hijacked and slammed into towers, but a war that ends all life on Earth is a science fiction story usually involving aliens instead of a very real possibility. Kids learn about the Cold War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis and other events and they don’t really understand that all life on Earth really could have ended in the blink of an eye while the Soviet Union and the United States faced off against each other. “Likewise, those of us who lived during the Cold War have a hard time adjusting to a world where the biggest threat to our country is that we might lose a skyscraper, or at worst a single city.” I continued. “We remember the perspective of losing our entire planet, and we subconsciously escalate the threat we face then with the threat we face now. So we react out of proportion to the real threat at hand.” “You say that in the future terrorists manage to strike our cities with nukes?” Wolfowitz asked with a shocked look. “In part because we badly handled the breakup of the Soviet Union, yes.” I confirmed. “Which you are trying to change.” Lerner added. “Yes.” I agreed. “I know on the surface it looks like what I was doing seems solely selfish, and I won’t deny there is a selfish aspect to it, but in the long run it was to be for the betterment of our country, and by extension our world.” “I see.” Lerner nodded. “Thank you for your candor, Mr. Breckenridge. We’ll take a short break for now, and begin again in about an hour, over lunch.” “Thank you for listening.” I said politely as they left the room. A soldier poked his head into the room and I followed him out, back to the room I’d slept in with the others. Sean was there already, as was Davey, although the rest of our friends were gone. “Where’s everyone?” I asked. “Getting a tour.” Davey said with a frown. “I wasn’t invited.” “Why not?” I asked. “For some reason they think I know more than I’m telling.” Davey said with a groan. “They seem to think I’m responsible for all this time travel mess, but it was that other me, wasn’t it?” “You’re right.” I assured him. “It’s not fair.” “Nothing in life is fair.” Sean muttered with a shake of his head. “So, Brian, did they bring up the idea of rebuilding a time machine and another jammer?” “Yes.” I said and Davey let out a groan. “They asked me about it too, like I knew anything!” He moaned. “Still, I told them it was probably for the best, to solve this situation, but that maybe someone should go back just to make sure there wasn’t another time travel device, like you’d planned.” “Which is how I’m here, and we’re all here in the Pentagon instead of in the hospital room.” Sean muttered. “What hospital room?” I asked in alarm and Sean frowned. “I didn’t want to tell the others, but on that night, on the way home from the game, there was an accident.” Sean said sadly. “Todd got hit by a drunk driver while they were walking back, and spent six days in a coma before he died. It was weird seeing him after all these years, but that’s at least one good change, although if we do this plan of building another machine, I don’t know what good it will be in the long run.” “Gentlemen.” A voice called from the doorway and we looked up to see an Army Colonel standing there. “Would you please come with me?” We followed the man through the bowels of the Pentagon and up into the actual halls of the regular portions of the building. Our friends were waiting outside a set of doors that I recognized as leading to the Secretary of Defense’s office, all of them looking a little worried. We waited there, not saying a word until the doors opened and we were escorted inside to find a room mostly empty except for a few Secret Service agents, and the President. “I thought I’d come over here and take a look at you myself.” Ronald Reagan said in a slightly cheerful tone as I stepped forward a pace from my friends and moved to shake his hand. “Mr. President, it’s an honor to meet you.” I said. “My name is Brian Breckenridge. These are my friends.” He shook hands as I introduced each of my friends, and then invited us to sit down in chairs that had been arranged in a circle. He took one of the chairs, and I ended up sitting on his left hand. Sean sat on the other side of him. “I find all this hard to believe, but my people assure me it is genuine.” He said after a moment of silence while we all got settled. “One thing that is bothering me: Why would supposedly smart young men like you be working on the Dukakis campaign?” “He’s a loser, Mr. President.” I said with a chuckle as Davey laughed and gave me a knowing look. “There’s no way he was going to win this campaign, but working on it gave us the start of certain connections that will be needed later on. I hate to tell you this, but Republicans don’t hold on to the oval office forever, and well, the Democrats need a lot more help than the Vice-President.” “They always are in need of help, Mr. Breckenridge.” The President laughed before turning serious. “There appears to be open fighting going on in the Kremlin, and we’re not sure which side is going to come out on top. My advisors tell me that the two of you can make another one of these infernal machines, and put an end to this time travel business once and for all.” “Yes, Mr. President.” Sean said in a slightly awed voice. “I believe the problem was that a frequency was left open for Brian’s transport back. With his help, we can isolate all remaining frequencies and jam those too.” “Are you willing to do this, young man?” He asked me with a very direct gaze. “I understand you have some issues.” “I do, but they pale besides the comparison of a war between the USSR and the USA.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. Davey let out a small whimper that drew his attention. “Do you have a problem with this, Mr. Jones?” The President asked him. “It’s just… my life is better than it would have been without his changes.” Davey said slowly but he shook his head. “Still, put up against a possible war with the Soviet’s, it’d be better for my life to go the way it was than for people to die in a big war.” “I can sympathize with that feeling young man.” The President said with a kindly smile. “I asked myself, just to get an idea of what I was going to be asking you young men to give up, how I would feel if such actions meant I would never be President. In the end, I decided that it would be a price I was willing to pay in order to stop a World War.” “We don’t know a World War is going to happen.” Todd argued and then he blushed when the President turned his attention to him. “What do our two time travelers believe?” President Reagan asked. “There will be a war.” I said at once and Sean nodded his agreement. “If you’re sure about it.” Todd said at last with a sigh. “Now, how long will it take to rebuild this time machine, and what resources will you need?” The President asked us directly and I looked over at Sean, who would be the one doing most of the work. I didn’t know half of what was needed, no, not even a quarter! In the end it took five years to build the machine, and the world was a nightmare. Shevardnadze’s hard-line faction won the shoot-out in the Kremlin, and the Soviet Union was ruled with an iron fist. Protests at the ending of Glasnost and similar Gorbachev programs were brutally crushed, and Hungary never voted out the communists. In 1989, the Berlin Wall never fell, and we came damn close to losing West Berlin itself. The scientist who had invented the time machine was never found, until a CIA agent caught wind of him in Moscow during the final days of 1989. Our agents couldn’t get anywhere near Shevardnadze, but they managed to poison the scientist before he could build another machine for the Soviets. The expected response, a KGB attack on Sean and his family only succeeded in killing Sean’s father. Sean shrugged it off as ‘no big deal’. There was an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, but this time it was backed by the full might of the Soviet Union. Thanks to information we had given our government, and the focused efforts of our intelligence agencies, the Iraqis and Soviets had a little surprise as Iraqi troops barely paused to consolidate Kuwait before pushing into Saudi Arabia. An entire carrier battle group surged into the Gulf, and its planes began bombing the Iraqi troops as soon as they were outside the city of Kuwait. American fighters surged from Germany (after being refueled by planes staged in Israel and Saudi Arabia) engaged Iraq’s air force, slaughtering them in a great air-to-air battle that lasted for twelve hours. It took nearly two weeks for two Marine Amphibious groups to arrive, and by then most of Iraq’s armor in the area had been crushed. The US Marines landed in Kuwait with enough force, and complete air coverage, and the remaining Iraqi troops fled Kuwait like rats from a sinking ship. The Soviet Union, with a bloody nose, pulled back for a little while, licking its wounds while the KGB fomented problems for us in South America. In 1992, George H. W. Bush easily won reelection in a Cold War that wasn’t quite so cold anymore. By the end of 1993, we were conducting our first tests with the new machine. The truth was that Sean was right about me. When it came to the theory behind time travel and its operations, or actually putting it together, I couldn’t help much. However, when it came to operating the machine, or the new ‘jamming’ device, figuring which frequencies, and similar things, I ended up being a lot of help. Poor Davey, Brandon, Trevor, and Todd were stuck being with us, acting as moral support most of the time, although each of them helped in their own way. Todd and Brandon helped with different aspects of the computer components or software, working with the experts the government had assigned us as if they had already completed a full college education in their specific fields. Since they spent the first two years of the project going to classes at Georgetown, that was pretty much the case. Trevor helped in other ways, by helping relieve tension when it built up too high, or asking really basic questions when we were stuck, forcing us to think again in much simpler terms. (He called them stupid questions, but they were far from stupid and helped us solve several problems.) Together, all of us made an impressive team, and when the machine was ready for testing, the military took precautions, but did not deny us all a place in the chamber where the machine was waiting. “You understand, no time travelers.” Roger Sazar, the President’s point man on this project said while we waited for the airlock to cycle. We were actually located in a remote facility in the backwoods of Virginia. This was the bunker built for members of Congress in case of nuclear attack, and had everything needed for our experiments. We had a good, strong, dependable power supply, plenty of food and water, and most importantly in the eyes of the government, hundreds of soldiers to make sure no one went back in time. Our mission was simple, power up the machine, activate the jammer that would keep me, and the others, from going back in time, and then wait to make sure the outside world survived. We had plenty of antennas and other equipment that would allow us to monitor the outside world for a long time before we shut down the bubble and ended our own existence. “We understand.” I repeated for my friends one last time as the huge airlock door, nearly five feet of reinforced steel and concrete swung open. Sean and I led the way in, barely looking at the MRI-type machine surrounded by twenty armed soldiers. Davey and the rest followed us into the control room where a bank of control machines waited for us, and a thick glass window allowed us to monitor events in the machine room. There were more soldiers standing guard in here, and two Generals who nodded at us as we entered. “General Crowley, are we ready to begin?” I asked. As head of the scientific team, I was to have the honor of actually giving the orders, but he was here to countermand anything I might do to stop events. Sure, I’d said I was willing to suffer the consequences, but the government was making sure. “You may proceed.” He said as the airlock door closed with a thud. The room was sealed, and my ears popped as it pressurized to prevent any form of attack from outside. We knew the Soviets had gotten wind of our program, and my knowledge of the timeline where they used nukes in an attempt to stop Davey from going back again warned us that if they knew we were acting today, there would be nuclear war. “Power her up.” I said with a nod to Davey. All of my friends had roles to play today, at the controls of the machine. Sure, we admitted it could be operated with fewer people, but the more hands on deck today, the more likely we could succeed. “Um, General, you might want those soldiers to stand further away from the machine.” Sean said with a bit of muffled laughter. “Why is that, son?” The General asked with a frown. “The machine is a Magnetic Resonance Imager, General.” Trevor reminded him. “It creates a very high-power magnetic field that will…oops, too late.” There was a great clatter, and muffled curses coming from the machine room as soldiers lost bits of metal, and their weapons to the magnetic field of the machine. The equipment flew across the room and attached itself to the machine, and the soldiers cursed as they tried to retrieve their gear. “Damn it!” The General cursed as he turned to the other soldiers in the room. “Go help them. No! Leave your gear here! Can you shut the machine down?” “Begin reducing power to the machine, gradually.” I ordered and Sean began moving a lever on the controls as the remaining soldiers in our control room dropped their weapons, and every bit of metal on their body before heading into the other room to help their comrades. It was a shame really, they were just following orders but it was necessary. “What’s happening?” General Crowley asked as the door between the control room and the machine room closed. “We’ve got a breach in the coolant system!” Todd’s voice sounded alarmed and the two Generals and Sazar, the only men in the room besides my friends, rushed to the control panel and looked out the window to where the soldiers were now choking as some gas spewed from the machine. “Get them out of there!” Sazar shouted, looking around the control panel frantically. “Sorry.” Brandon murmured as he, Davey, and Trevor turned around with small stun guns in their hands. All three men received several shocks before they passed out. Then they were tied up, gagged, and sedated with some drugs from a military first aid kit that would guarantee they would not wake up for a while. Outside the last of the soldiers had succumbed to the gas. “I feel…dirty.” Todd murmured as we looked out at the collapsed soldiers. “None of them should be dead.” Davey murmured softly. “C’mon, we’ve got to clean up in there.” Everyone except Sean and I left the control room after the gas was vented from the other room, and the door opened. The machine was powered down just long enough to remove all the weapons and gear attracted to it, and the collapsed soldiers from locations near the machine. Then it was powered up again to full power. “How much power do we have?” I asked Sean who smiled happily. “More than enough.” He answered. “Let’s get this show on the road then.” I replied and went out to the main room, where Davey kissed me before helping me onto the machine’s platform. He handled the needle himself, and kissed me one last time before my eyes closed and I prepared for another trip back in time. Chapter 21 I opened my eyes and smiled at the sight of my old bedroom. Sunlight was just peaking in through the drapes, and I could clearly make out the football and wrestling posters on the walls, the comforter Mom had changed out when I’d reached fourteen, and the older, smaller dresser I’d had until I entered high school. Yep, I’d come back for a third childhood, and the preliminary evidence showed we’d hit it around the right timeframe. I got out of bed slowly, knowing from the last experience it would take a moment to get accustomed to the younger body. Certainly it felt weird being several inches shorter, and about forty pounds lighter, without quite as much muscle buildup as I had in my early twenties. My morning woody was a little different as well, a little smaller, and a lot more sensitive than I remembered it being even at twenty. After turning on the room light, I got a good glance at the calendar and smiled at the pile of books on my desk while the brand new backpack sat on the chair, waiting to be loaded. Yep, it was the first day of seventh grade, and I’d stayed up late last night getting ready, but not loading my backpack until the morning. “Brian!” Mom’s voice was accompanied by a knock. “You better get a move on or you’re going to be late for your first day!” “I’m up mom!” I shouted back, surprised at how my voice cracked right in the middle of that. Oh yeah, I wasn’t out of puberty yet. I’d been spared that particular curse, for the most part, the last time I’d gone back, but as I began to wake up a little more, I could feel how… unbalanced things felt inside of me. This was going to be weird. “What do you want for breakfast?” She yelled back, and I opened the door, forgetting I was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers and that the front of them was tented a bit. She gave me a look that almost made me blush. “Sorry, pancakes would be nice.” I said with a slight smile and she nodded before moving towards the kitchen while shaking her head. For my part, I grabbed a towel from the hall closet and went to take a shower. It was nice being home, and I felt so relaxed as I cleaned up, and took care of the morning business while wondering what Davey was going to look like at this age. Sure, I could call up a memory, but that had been a different Davey. I was going to get to see the original twelve-year old Davey. “Are you excited, honey?” Mom asked me twenty minutes later after I’d dressed in a new pair of jeans, a nice blue button-down shirt with a sleeveless checkered sweater over it, and my loaded backpack was sitting on the floor next to me as I ate breakfast. “You wouldn’t believe how excited I am.” I told her as Dad came into the room, dressed for work. “Morning Dad!” “Morning Brian.” Dad said with a slight smile. “Oh, I don’t know, I can remember the first time I went to Junior High.” Mom said with a wide smile. “Just don’t forget to say hello to your aunt.” “I won’t.” I groaned playfully and she laughed softly. Fifteen minutes later we were walking outside, towards her car, and I remembered why I’d almost been late on the first day of school. “The tires flat!” Mom groaned as she noticed the driver’s side tire. “You’re going to be late for school!” “If you don’t mind getting Dad to change it for you, I can jog and make it to school on time.” I offered and she frowned. “I don’t want you showing up to your first class all sweaty.” She stated. “Don’t worry mom, get dad to fix the tire and I’ll get to school.” I said as I leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek. I still had to stand on my tiptoes to do that. “Okay, but you be careful!” She yelled. It wasn’t that bad of a jog to school, and I passed the familiar faces of Ronna and Jeanette on the way. They looked young, and were happily talking away to each other, but Davey was nowhere in sight with them as he’d been before. How many times had he told me the story about me bumping into him that first time he came back in time? It was a little disappointing to me that he wasn’t there now, but the sight waiting for me at the end of the bike path more than made up for that lack. “Heya, Bri.” Trevor said with a smile as I came to a stop next to him. “Yo Bri, glad you could make it.” Brandon added with a smile, and then turned back to tickle Sean who was too busy giggling to do more than wave. Todd was laughing at their antics from where he stood next to Trevor. His red hair was longer than I remembered, and he looked like a stoner, but otherwise was very much the Todd I remembered. Davey was standing there, on the opposite side of the circle of friends from me, giving me a very welcome smile. It was so hard not to take him in my arms and kiss him right here and now. He was only slightly overweight, and there was a nice-sized pimple on his right cheek, but he was my Davey, and the best part was the Davey looking out at me through those eyes. It wasn’t the twelve-year old, but the slightly older, slightly more mature Davey from the last timeline. The one who’d managed to make it through the challenges of rough teenage years and become a good man. “Looks like we all made it this time.” Davey said softly. “Yup, just like Brian planned.” Todd added. “You come up with good plans, Bri.” Trevor added with a sigh. “So what happens now? We never got enough time where they weren’t listening to go into too many details about what happens when we all get back.” “We’ll discuss it after school, okay?” I offered. “You mean after flag-football practice.” Brandon pointed out. “Well, what are Sean and I going to do while you boys get all hot and sweaty?” Todd asked. “What about me?” Davey pointed out. “I’m not on the team.” “Like hell you’re not.” Trevor snorted. “You’re signing up today.” Brandon said as he got Sean into a headlock and proceeded to give him a noogie. “As for these two, we could use some pretty cheerleaders.” “I’d watch that if I were you.” Sean growled as he slipped out of the headlock and managed to kick the back of Brandon’s knees, sending him to the ground. We all laughed as Brandon looked up in surprise at his boyfriend. “I learned wrestling in the last timeline, remember?” “Yeah, I remember.” Brandon laughed. “Just checking to see if your runt of a body could still get out of it.” “Runt of a body, you really don’t want any do you?” Sean teased him. “Um, about that.” Brandon said and he looked over at me. “Aren’t we like twelve now?”",

      "content": "“We’re all twelve now, right?” I asked and got nods all around. “Should we be having sex?” Brandon asked. “Well, it’s not like we weren’t playing around at this age anyway.” Trevor said, but then he gave me a look. “Well, most of us were anyway.” “Aren’t we all like virgins again?” Todd asked. “I know I am.” “So am I, physically.” Sean said, but he was grinning at Brandon. “For right now, at least.” “So am I, but I don’t see why we shouldn’t have fun.” I said with a shrug. “I mean, we’re all pretty established in our relationships, right?” “Yeah, that’s for sure.” Davey said with a smile. “Just remember, coming out right now isn’t going to be fun or easy.” Sean reminded all of us. “My parents, and Davey’s at least will have conniption fits and we’re too young to get emancipated yet.” “I hate being young again.” Davey moaned. “You lose so many privileges that being an adult gets you.” “It takes some adjustment.” I agreed. “Some of us have it easier than others, and we should make sure our families get used to us spending a lot of time together. For now, my place, or Trevor’s will be the best place to get together as a group.” “Oh yeah, a lot of trips to the barn.” Brandon said with a leer at Sean. “You really are cute at this age, you know. Then again you’re cute at any age.” “You’re just saying that because your twelve-year old hormones are talking.” Sean teased back, but he was smiling as the bell rang. “Ah, crap, we got class.” Trevor groaned, and we all headed into the school as a group. A few of our ‘friends’ from this time gave us odd looks because Todd, Sean and Davey weren’t normally part of our group, but they’d get used to that in time. Time. We had so much time to plan now, and while it was true I hadn’t been able to do more than lay out the basic elements of how to secure access to the time machine and get us all back here, but I had spent plenty of time over the last years in that other timeline planning on what to do when we got here. First off was to get reestablished in our younger bodies, and our younger lives. There were other things to take care of, but that would take a little bit longer. I intended to make sure that no other time machine could be built, and to do that someone would have to die. The easiest would be the scientist. While my friends had by and large balked at the idea of killing the soldiers and others that would be in the chamber with us, I had been able to adapt those plans to non-lethal means. Sean and Davey, though, had shown no squeamishness at killing, and they would be the ones to help me with the plans for the scientist that had started this whole chain of events. We had years, though, before we needed to take those steps. For now, the most important thing was to just enjoy the fact that instead of being a lonely time traveler, we were all in our younger bodies, and we all remembered our friendships and relationships with each other. There would be no dancing around, trying to reestablish what had been begun in a previous timeline. I just did my best to not think about certain things that couldn’t be changed. Uncle Rich already had AIDS, and he’d die around Christmastime this year. Going back earlier might have changed that, but the fact was we knew that at this age our bodies were able to handle the adult memories of past lives. Going back further endangered that, as Davey learned in my original timeline. Saving Uncle Rich just wasn’t worth that risk. First period English was fun, but jock math was absolute hell for me. By whispered agreement, those of us in that class (Trevor, Davey, and I) agreed we’d get out of it after the first week and into a more advanced math. Davey joined Brandon, Trevor and me for lunch, while Sean and Todd visited with some of their old friends. While we were all good friends as young adults, the truth was that we moved in different circles during Junior and Senior High, and while we were going to be making many changes, they didn’t all need to start on the first day. After practice we all met in a nearby park, sitting together at one of the wooden benches that dotted the area. We had the area pretty much to ourselves, and wouldn’t have to worry about a parent coming in and hearing us talk about things they wouldn’t be prepared to understand. It was pretty obvious the younger hormones were kicking in, because there was a lot of physical contact between the various couples as we sat down to talk. “Ugh, this is going to drive me insane.” Trevor groaned as Todd sat next to him. “You’ve got a barn, invite me to dinner.” Todd teased him and Trevor growled. “You’re coming to dinner.” “Geez, twist my arm, why don’t ya?” Todd laughed. “Where are we going?” Sean asked Brandon. “There’s some bushes over there.” Brandon said with a jerk of his head. “We have those reserved.” Davey added. “Business first?” I asked, hating to break up the horny banter. I knew only part of it was from actual horniness. Most came from the fact that we’d succeeded in fooling several powerful people over several very tense years. “Yeah, okay, how do we prevent World War III?” Davey asked in a mock-serious tone. “We kill the bad Russian.” Trevor offered. “Better yet, we kill the scientist.” Todd offered. “Um, didn’t you guys hesitate at…” I started to suggest but Brandon shook his head. “That was different.” Brandon said. “Those guys were innocent.” “Yeah.” Trevor agreed. “Yup.” Todd added. “Well, we’ve got years before that is necessary.” I pointed out. “In fact, we should probably wait until we’re at least sixteen or seventeen and don’t have to depend on others for transportation.” “But you have an idea about how to do it, right?” Davey asked. “I’m thinking either a car accident, or poison.” I admitted. “I’d lean towards car accident but we have to make sure it’s fatal. We’ll spend a few months observing him and his movements, and work out a more exact plan once we’re older. They don’t come back until 1988, remember?” “That’s right, so there’ll be in plenty of time.” Sean smiled. “Okay, so what about between now and then?” Trevor asked. “Do we just lay low, be normal students or whatever, keep the fact that we’re fucking like bunnies a secret and just live life or do we do something?” “Sean, you said when you came back that my plans to help alleviate the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union didn’t work.” I stated. “Is it fair to say the problem was what I expected, that there wasn’t enough time between 1988 and 1991?” “That was what you decided before I came back.” Sean answered. “You said ground work would have to be made several years earlier in order to get a better impact.” “So, a question for all of us.” I said and was glad that the playfulness had died down. Everyone was as serious as could be right now. “Do we live our lives as normally as possible, not showing we already know what we’re learning in classes, or do we do something different?” “You’re not talking about admitting to the government we’re time travelers, are you?” Davey asked suspiciously. “Hell no.” I snorted. “That’s just asking for trouble, especially once they believe us. No. You know, we’re just an extraordinary group of geniuses who manage to learn very fast and learn at a very accelerated rate. If we play it right, we can be finishing up high school by the time we’re fifteen, and we can be in the right schools, at the right time to advance the right theories to the right people a few years earlier.” “But, our friends…” Todd started to protest and then he sighed. “Why do I see your faces being in my future for decades?” “We’ll make other friends along the way, but at least we’ll always have each other to fall back on.” Davey said with an appreciative look on his face. “I mean, think about what we’ve been through, what we’ve done. I know all of you will always be important to me for the rest of my life.” “Aw, how sweet.” Sean said in a mock-moan, but everyone had embarrassed smiles on their faces. “So how do we do this?” Trevor asked. “I mean, is there anyone who isn’t onboard with this idea?” “Nope.” Several of them said at once. Then everyone looked at me again. Even though Sean had come back in the last timeline, I was still the ‘oldest’ of them, and had all the knowledge of the original Davey Jones at my recall. “For now, we just ace every quiz, every test and we make it very obvious to our teachers that we’re extremely bored with their work.” I explained easily. “They should get the hint within a month, and if any of them don’t we’ll take other steps through my aunt. Their next step should be to give us new assessment tests, where we’ll do everything but the absolutely most difficult questions. I don’t think any of us except maybe Davey and Trevor will have problems with the math parts.” “Yeah, I might fail that part.” Davey said with a chortle. He’d always hated math. “That should give the teachers a conundrum to deal with, and we’ll probably be accused of cheating.” I continued with a laugh. “So, we’ll probably end up taking the tests again, and we should perform about the same. After a lot of head scratching, our parents will probably come talk to us about skipping a grade or two. Maybe even sending all of us to a special school. We should end up freshmen somewhere, and from there it’ll be a few years until we get our high school diplomas and move on to college.” “No sports then.” Trevor said with a frown. “Well, we might be able to figure something out there, although we’ll definitely be at a disadvantage with our lack of development.” I said with a shrug. “We can always do three-on-three.” Davey said, and then blushed as a few of the guys chuckled. “Sorry, not on our backs.” “Don’t get kinky, Jones.” Todd grumbled playfully. “What careers do we get this time?” Sean asked. “I mean, I like physics and all, but I’d really like to go into computers.” “I really want to focus on computers too.” Brandon added. “Some of the stuff that was coming out there before we left, it was pretty damn cool.” “I want to do the political stuff again.” Davey said with a smile and then he shrugged when everyone groaned. “Hey, I like it!” “I know.” Todd added. “I’m not sure what I want to do right now.” “Me neither.” Trevor added. “We don’t have to decide now.” I reminded them. “You’ve got a year or two. Remember, we’re going to know more than other kids our age, but that doesn’t necessarily make us geniuses. We’re still going to have to learn things, but we’ll have a head start. That’s the main thing to remember. When we get back into college, it’ll be slower going again.” “Got it.” Trevor murmured. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, Todd needs to see my barn and what it looked like in 1981.” “Have fun.” Davey leered at them and he grinned at me. “Want to walk me home, Brian? You might not know this, but your place is on the way to where I live now.” “Sure.” I agreed while Brandon and Sean got up, heading for some bushes without even a word to us. “I do love you.” Davey said softly as we began the walk home. “You know, I’ve got some changes to make with my father.” “Stopping him from molesting Jenny, yes.” I agreed. “If we leave too soon for some advanced school, I won’t be able to do that.” Davey said. “Any suggestions on how to go about this?” “Start with Jenny.” I offered and he nodded. “You mean talk to her about inappropriate touching and stuff, and how even if it was your parent you should tell someone, or better yet, scream as loud as you can to stop it from happening?” He threw out several ideas, all of them good. “I think we’re on the right track.” I replied as we kept walking and talking. When we got to my place, we walked up and in the front door together, and for a moment we both totally forgot that my parents had not met him yet. “You’re home late.” Mom said a little tightly. “And who is this?” “Oh, um, yeah, sorry mom.” I said with a wry grin. “This is my new best friend, Davey Jones. I thought you should meet him since you’re going to be seeing a lot of him from now on.” “Well, that was quite an introduction.” Mom said with an odd look on her face, but she smiled at Davey and shook his hand. “I think my son might have just fallen in love.” “It might be puppy love.” Davey said dead-pan. “I better watch it in case he decides to start humping my leg.” The look on mom’s face was priceless, and I couldn’t decide if she was going to not like Davey, or fall over laughing. She ended up laughing so hard there were tears in her eyes. “Oh my, your Uncle Rich is going to love hearing this.” Mom said to me as she began to get control over herself. “That’s your uncle in the City, right?” Davey said to me with a wink. “You’re going to have to take me to meet him sometime.” “How about this weekend?” I asked and looked at mom who was looking at us with surprise. “Do you think Uncle Rich might like some visitors?” “I’m sure he’d love to have you guys visit, but um, Brian, are you sure that…” Mom’s voice trailed off as she looked uncomfortably at Davey. “Don’t worry, ma’am, Brian’s already told me about his gay uncle, and no it doesn’t bother me at all.” Davey said with a smile. “My dad’s the hellfire and brimstone preacher, not me. I tend to take a more relaxed view of the world.” “I see.” She said with a twinkle in her eye. “Brian, where did you find this guy?” “On the way to school.” I answered. “Well, would you boys like a snack or something?” Mom asked as she recovered. “No thanks, ma’am.” Davey said with a smile. “I need to get home before Mom gets off work. She probably expects me to have done my chores instead of goofing off with this lug.” “Well, it was nice to meet you.” Mom said with a genuine smile. “I’ll have to meet your parents some day.” “I’m sure you will, ma’am.” Davey said with a twinkle in his eyes and I walked him to the door. She was still watching us, so we couldn’t kiss, but he did mouth ‘I love you’ before turning and walking away. “He’s quite a character.” Mom repeated when I shut the door. “I take it you had a good first day of school?” “You wouldn’t believe how good of a day.” I told her with a smile. The night was odd, I realized as I had nothing to do, really. The few chores I finished before dinner, and something in me wanted to be out, celebrating with my friends, and with Davey, but I knew that could not happen just yet. I spent several hours watching television with my parents, talking with them a little before heading into my room for bed. Twice while I thought about Davey I managed to jerk off, amazed at the sharpness, the almost overpowering level of sensations that rushed through my body. It really was different. “I don’t mind walking, mom.” I told my mother the next day as I waited for Davey. He showed up with his sister in tow. She really was a cute little girl, but she was giving Davey the oddest looks. It wasn’t until we left her at El Vista and headed on to our own school that I found out why. “When I got home last night, I found she’d gotten into my room, taken all my Star Wars action figures and had them in her room playing with her Barbie dolls.” Davey chuckled. “You should have seen her face. She was sitting there, fully prepared for me to launch into a tirade and for us to get in a fight.” “What did you do?” I asked with a smile. Oh yes, younger siblings could do such challenging things all the time. “I told her that when she was done, she’d better put them back where she found them.” Davey laughed. “Then, later, when Mom got home she whined that I was telling her what to do!” “What did your Mom say?” I asked. “She asked what I’d told Jenny to do, and Jenny told her that I was demanding she put away my toys.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “Mom turned to me and before she could say anything, I said ‘The toys she took out of my room and was playing with in her room.’ Mom turned right back around and told Jenny if she didn’t do what I told her, she would be grounded. I swear, if I’d known I’d get that sort of reaction, I’d have done that the first time around.” “It is nice having an older perspective.” I said. “Yeah, but there’s nice things about being younger again, too.” Davey said with a look I knew all too well. His voice dropped an octave. “I thought I was about to leap out of my body when I came last night thinking about you.” “Yeah, me too.” I admitted with a slight blush. “So, when are we going to sneak off somewhere?” He asked me. “Come over to my house after school.” I told him. “Mom’s going to be gone to her sister’s.” “Sounds good to me.” Davey said with a smile. “We can break your bed in again.” “I like that idea.” I said before we met up with our friends at the end of the bike path across from the school. We were fifteen minutes early, but everyone was there. “We need to talk some more about this whole idea.” Trevor said after we’d gotten the greetings out of the way. “I’m not sure if I want to go this route, and Brian, you’re always talking about how our biggest problems stem from us not fully thinking our way through things. We need to be careful about this.” “I agree.” I told him. “Good.” Todd added his agreement and everyone nodded their heads as well. That afternoon, in my house void of any parents, Davey and I managed to get our clothes off and explore our younger bodies. The equipment wasn’t full grown yet, but oh the feelings they generated! Both of us were far too noisy when we climaxed, and we lay there on the bed, together, panting and totally drained afterwards. “That was too good.” Davey said softly. “I’d forgotten what it was like. No wonder people get screwed up having sex too young. It’s just too intense for thought.” “Yep.” I agreed with him before slipping into a light doze. Fortunately Mom’s car in the driveway woke us both, and we got dressed in plenty of time before she made it inside. “Oh, hi Davey!” Mom said with a smile when we came out of the bedroom. “I didn’t know you were here.” “Brian and I were doing some homework.” Davey said with a theatrical sigh. “Those darn teachers! They’ve already got us doing homework!” “I’m sure you’ll survive.” She said with a little laugh. “Were you serious about going to the City this weekend?” He asked both her and me at the same time. “I did talk to Rich today, and he’s free if you boys wanted to visit.” Mom said with a look at me. “That sounds good.” I agreed. “My parents said I could go, but they want to meet you and Mr. B first.” Davey said to her. “Do you think your parents would like to come over for dinner on Thursday?” Mom asked. “As long as we bring my brat of a sister, they’ll probably be delighted.” Davey said and she laughed. “Oh, you have a sister?” She asked and he answered, talking about Jenny for a good five minutes. Poor Mom, Davey had her number already and she didn’t stand a chance against his manipulations. He’d have her eating out of his hand by the end of the week, and it was fun to watch. Oh yes, this was going to be the best timeline ever. Chapter 22 “I don’t know quite what to say, Brian.” Uncle Rich’s voice was weak, and he looked like death warmed over in his hospital bed. An I.V. line pumped liquids into him, but it was only a matter of time, hours, maybe a day or two if he was really lucky. He knew it as well as I did, sitting in this ward of the hospital in San Francisco. Outside it was Christmas, and people were celebrating the holiday with their families. I was too, in my own way, but it was a far different celebration. “I’m sorry, Uncle Rich.” I said softly, still holding his hand. His grip was weak, but he squeezed my hand as tightly as he could. “Don’t be, boy.” He said before a coughing fit took him. He punched the button on the morphine drip, and sighed as more of the drug flowed into his system. I knew he’d be asleep before long, and it would be wrong to keep Mom out of the room for much longer. Her, and her sister, and my father were all here, but I’d begged a few hours alone with him, and gotten them. “If we’d come back earlier, I might have warned you in time.” I said softly. “But we couldn’t quite arrange it perfectly.” “It’s almost too hard to believe, but you sound like you’re serious, so I’m going to believe you.” Rich said weakly, his voice relaxing as the drug eased his pain. “It certainly explains your sudden stroke of genius and them wanting to skip you ahead a few grades.” “It does, doesn’t it?” I said with a small smile. “Thank you, Uncle Rich. The last few months have been wonderful seeing you so much, you know.” “You’ve been a good nephew, and I like your friend, a lot.” Rich said with a chuckle. “Brenda doesn’t quite see it, but I was damn sure you two were a couple before you told me all this time travel stuff. Fated lovers. Got to love that. You be good to each other, you hear me? Stay faithful to each other too, with this damn disease. I wish you could do something about that.” “We’re trying.” I assured him. “We have to be subtle, but we’re pretty sure we found a way to get the right information to the right people without raising too many questions.” “That’s good.” He said before closing his eyes. His breathing was still shallow, but it was pain-free, and he was obviously asleep. I stood up, kissed his forehead and walked out of the room. “He’s asleep.” I said to Mom, who was standing outside with Aunt Linda and Dad. “Did you two say goodbye?” Mom asked and I nodded, letting the tears slide down my face. We really had said goodbye, and I’d had to ask forgiveness for not coming back further in time to save him. At least he’d given me that forgiveness. “Why don’t we go for a walk, son?” Dad said in a gentle voice as the two women went back into the room. I nodded, and we walked out of the hospital into the cool San Francisco morning. It would have been nice if Davey could have been here, but his parents had firmly put their foot down against his visiting over Christmas. There had been a big enough fight when they’d found out that Uncle Rich was sick, and with what. That had nearly shattered the budding friendship between our parents, but we were working on it. “How are you feeling, son?” Dad asked after we’d gone a few blocks. “Better.” I told him. “So much is changing.” Dad said sadly. “Your mother is going to be grieving for a while. You do understand that it isn’t likely…” “He’ll be gone in hours, or maybe a few days at most.” I said sadly. “I’ll miss him.” “I will too.” Dad said. “He’s a good man. It’s a shame he’s dying.” “It is.” I agreed. “How are you feeling about starting your new school?” Dad asked, changing the subject. “Are you sure you want this? You’ll be far away from home. I don’t know how your mother will deal with you being gone to a boarding school.” “I’ll be coming back every couple of months, and all summer.” I reminded him with a smile. He just shook his head. “I know, it’s not the same, but really, I can get a better education there, and I think that’s what I should do. It’s not like I’m going to be alone, either. That’s why we all decided to stop pretending on our school work, because we realized we weren’t alone, and we had friends.” “You do have an amazing group of friends.” Dad agreed. “Still, your mother and I are going to miss having you around.” “Do you think this… argument over Uncle Rich is going to scuttle the plans you’ve been making with Mr. Jones?” I asked him and Dad looked surprised. “No, oddly enough, I don’t think so.” Dad said. “We even talked about that before we drove up here. You were already in bed, but he called wanting to make sure that I wasn’t so pissed off I was going to pull out. It’s a good idea, a good business plan, and we’ve already gotten the loans approved to get started. He may be a little stuffy about social stuff, but he’s a good talker and will make a good face for the business while I handle all the financial issues.” “Plus Mrs. Jones is a pretty good organizer, isn’t she?” I asked, pleased at how Davey and I had pulled off the project of getting our parents into business together. The combination of all four of them working together would help a lot of things, especially with his sister. His father was going to be too busy, and too happy to fall into the emotional state that had led to him molesting his daughter. “She is, she is.” Dad agreed. “The more I get to know them, the more amazed I am by them as a family. Sandy’s father is a blast.” “Dad, stop trying to use cool words.” I told my father and he laughed. By the time we had returned to the hospital, Mom and Aunt Linda were ready for dinner. After a good meal, everyone returned to Uncle Rich’s room, and it was time. I could feel it in the room, and part of me fell apart as his two sisters each held one of Uncle Rich’s hands. He’d been awake, but not really coherent when we came back from dinner. He’d quieted down and smiled though when they held his hands, and so they stood like that for several hours, none of us moving at all until his eyes closed for the last time, and his lungs exhaled for the very last time. While Dad held Mom, I held Aunt Linda who was crying just as hard as my mother. We cleared the room while nurses and a doctor filed in to do all the official things they have to do, and we tried to comfort the two women. My own eyes were filled with tears, and I had to struggle to remember the forgiveness I’d been given for not stopping this. It really was a sad Christmas, but at least there was some more healing to be done after we returned home to Modesto. We’d pulled in and I was still unloading the car when a familiar brown Buick pulled up in front of our house. Mr. Jones was dressed in one of his best suits, and Mrs. Jones was wearing what looked like a new dress as they got out of the car. Even Davey was wearing a suit, and Jenny had on a very pretty dress as well as they walked up the driveway towards me. “Davey told us of your loss, Brian.” David Jones, Sr. said in a quiet, deep voice. “How are you holding up?” “I’m well, sir.” I said quietly, returning his politeness with politeness of my own. “It went as well as one could hope. Uncle Rich was surrounded by his family up until the very end.” “As it should be.” He said with a slight bow of his head. “Do you think your parents would be up for visitors?” “I think they’ll be happy to see you.” I offered and he smiled slightly as Davey took the suitcase I was holding and I led his family up to my house. Mom and Dad were talking quietly in the dining room when we walked in, and at first they looked wary, but that quickly changed to grateful appreciation for their visitors. “You have no idea how much preaching I had to do.” Davey whispered to me as we stood out on the back porch while the adults were still inside, talking over coffee (and tea for Sandy). Jenny was in the living room watching television. “I took his own damn bible and started pulling out every bible verse I could find about love and forgiveness. Considering we were at Nanny’s, and all the family was there, it turned into a free-for-all bible study session. When Papa came in on my side, I knew I’d won. “I knew you could do it.” I congratulated him softly and he blushed slightly. Making sure our parents stayed on good terms was important to both of us for a variety of reasons. My last time around, I’d taken the approach that I had plenty of years to make changes, but Sean had disabused me of that notion with our failure to stop the mad scientist and the power-hungry communist. Instead of just enjoying our collective new teenage years, we were going to take steps. Besides, as Trevor remarked, it got kind of old after a month. Even I’d forgotten the big differences between being twelve and being seventeen. We all had bed times that were far too early, our parents watched us a lot, a lot more than we were used to having to deal with, and of course none of us could legally drive. What had been a short car drive over to someone’s house turned into twenty or thirty minutes of bike riding, jogging, or begging for a ride from a parent. Sure, the school we were going to had a lot more restrictions in some ways, but in other ways it also had a lot more freedoms for us, and it would accelerate us on the path of making some changes. It was shortly after the New Year, 1982, when we all flew up to our new school with our parents. The school was a very private, very exclusive Military Preparatory Academy in the backwoods of upstate New York. I know most kids get threatened with being sent off to a military school if they are bad, but in this case there couldn’t have been a better fit for all of us. I had heard of the school in my original timeline because I’d worked with one person who had gone there. The man was a career diplomat in the State Department and one of the best at what he did. He had given full credit to the General John Cleveland Robinson Academy for giving him many of the skills he used in his work. As a private school, it accepted only students that it had invited to attend, and I was surprised when we received invitations in late November. Almost never did any school of this type offer mid-term admissions, and for all six of us to receive invitations was an opportunity I hoped we, as a group, would not pass up. After looking at their academic offerings, most of us were onboard with going there (especially since there were scholarships involved so that all of us could afford to attend), but the deciding factor for Trevor was the fact that they did have a football team. The school was your typical private boarding school, located on fairly large grounds that were well maintained, circled by a wall, and had uniformed guards at the front gate. There were four main large, multi-story buildings, and several smaller buildings as well as what looked like a fairly impressive sports complex all visible through the trees as we drove up the main drive. At the main building, an older man dressed in the uniform of an Army Colonel met us, and pleasantly greeted our parents before greeting the six of us who would be attending the school. “I am Colonel Barry Reynolds, the Deputy Superintendent of the Academy, and Professor of Military History.” He said by way of his own introduction. For the next hour, he personally led us on a tour of the facility, mostly directed at our parents. Then after introducing another man who was also an instructor there, we were separated from our parents and the real introductions began. “Each of you should be honored that we are accepting you as students here.” He told us in a stern voice. “You will be the youngest students in our school at this time, and you will have a lot of catching up to do from the beginning. That is why you are here a week before the term begins. We will cut you no slack once the term begins. For the next week you will be drilled in all the things you would have learned since last August regarding how this school operates. Four upper classmen have graciously volunteered to cut their leave period short in order to help prepare you for the new term. You will show them your appreciation by following all their directions to the utmost of your abilities.” He went on like that for several minutes, with all the typical things one might expect about the history and honor of the school. Then he introduced us to the upper classmen, who seemed a little taken aback that three of us were as tall as they were, even though we were five years younger. After a short period of their attempting to establish their dominance with typical bluster, our parents were returned for a lunch served in the dining hall of the school. That was where we were introduced to General Robert Lingstrom, the Superintendent of the school. He was a retired three-star Army General, who listed as part of his resume having worked for ten years at the National Security Agency. That was what had made us go from merely liking the idea of this school to doing my best to make sure everyone signed on with going here. After lunch, our parents gave us all a teary-eyed farewell; at least they were teary eyed while we all sighed with relief to see the rental cars leave. Then the upper classmen descended on us and gave us their version of a military boot camp. I wasn’t sure which disturbed them more, the ease with which all of us handled the push-ups and sit-ups they kept on requiring, the fact that all of us had already perfectly memorized the “General Orders” that all cadets were expected to know, or the fact that later that night none of us were homesick or crying, wanting to go back home. Todd and Sean were the two of us least accepting of the military mindset. I had been in the military myself, albeit as a reserve JAG officer, and Davey took to it like a fish to water. Trevor and Brandon accepted it with mild enjoyment, and although they didn’t really like all of it, Sean and Todd both tolerated it overall. The only thing they really complained about was the haircuts. They did not like having their hair shorn off, but even that they tolerated although I heard quite a few grumbles from them. The only real mistake the school had made was in the room assignments. All cadets lived in a two-person room. Each cadet had his own bunk, locker, wardrobe, and desk. Normally the school assigned cadets to the room, but during the first semester several cadets had ‘dropped out’ of the school, and the cadets left without a roommate had been moved, so there were more than three rooms available. No one had made room assignments for us, and that first day we were led to three available rooms, ordered to select our rooms and stow away our gear. That was a BIG mistake, but one we were extremely happy about because we were three couples and had been worried about how to get the right people to be rooming together. Since they had warned us that whoever we roomed with would be our roommates all through the rest of school, unless one of us dropped out, we were all extremely happy to make sure we roomed with our partner. At least now we would not have to be sneaking between rooms every night. “I don’t know if I can do this, Brian.” Davey moaned halfway through the first week. We were re-folding all of our clothes, mostly uniforms the school had provided. Like the real military, they expected everything folded in a very precise manner, just like our ‘bunks’ had to be made with tight corners precisely at a forty-five degree angle. “Do what?” I asked him. “Make my bed every damn morning, and fold my clothes like this.” Davey sighed. “What about all the other stuff?” I asked him and he laughed. “That shit is easy.” Davey said while laughing. “This is the hard shit.” For a week, the upper classmen tried to run us through what they thought would be hell. They got us up at three in the morning, and kept us going until late at night. There was a lot of physical exercise, but also a lot of mental drills as well. Marching was a big part of every day since it was a big part of the school’s daily routine, and we were drilled constantly on things like every little fact about the school’s namesake, Civil War Union General John Cleveland Robinson. Sunday was a little different for four of us since we were not used to dealing with ‘chapel’ or church services, but it was a requirement that all cadets attend. Davey and Sean snickered at the rest of us over that little aspect. Soon enough the term started, and the real schoolwork began. It took a few weeks for our fellow first-year cadets to warm up to us. At first they were standoffish with us new guys, but the first inter-house game competition in February broke the ice. We beat the sophomore team at nearly every event, and a large part of that was thanks to the athleticism of Trevor, Brandon, Davey and myself. The actual schoolwork was a mixture of easy and difficult subjects. We had no problems in the regular History, English, Math, or various Foreign Language subjects, but the Military History and other military-centered classes proved challenging. By the time Spring Break rolled around, everyone had expressed that they were generally happier at the school than they had been back home in Modesto. Still, it was good for all of us to go home over Spring Break and spend time with our families. For a week, we barely saw each other as we spent time with our individual families, but near the end of the week, it was our families who brought all of us together for a barbecue at a local park. There were about fifty of us altogether, as various grandparents, including my own grandparents who were still alive in this time line, all gathered along with our immediate families. When we returned from a very relaxing, and fun, Spring Break, each of us was called into the Superintendent’s office for one-on-one meetings. Overall, the General was pleased with how we were fitting into the school, but apparently some of the instructors were concerned that portions of our school work were ‘too easy’ for us. He did not like the idea that we were not being ‘challenged’ to develop to our full potential, and wanted to have us be given in-depth assessments by his faculty. That suited all of us just fine, because while some of our courses were challenging, we all knew that most of it was far too easy, and none of us liked the idea of not learning as much as we could. I think part of that was because of the last few years of the last timeline, where we’d raced against the clock to end a situation that threatened the stability of the world in which we lived. We all felt some personal level of responsibility to keep something like that from happening again, and mentally at least, we were all adults. Sure, we still had fun like any other teenagers, and a great deal of sex in the privacy of our own rooms, but we had a purpose, a mission, and we wanted to succeed in that mission. Summer was a fun time for all of us. We were thirteen, and had finished what was effectively our ‘freshman’ year of high school two years early. During that summer we spent a lot of time camping, hiking, fishing (including several trips with Davey’s grandfather), and all the typical summer activities of teenagers. Occasionally we’d have arguments, and fight, but we’d get over it when our tempers calmed down and usually end up laughing over what we fought about. The ‘business’ being started by my family and Davey’s was actually doing quite well. Parts of the idea had come from Davey’s father’s business in the last timeline. David Jones Sr. was proving to be quite a good salesman as he took the idea to companies like Microsoft, which was just starting to rise as a major player, and established giants like IBM. According to their business model it would still be another year before things actually got off the ground, but already they were doing quite well even though they had not yet delivered any finished product. We all ended up going back to the Academy several weeks early for the start of the football training program. The Academy took football quite seriously, and there was quite a bit of grumbling when Trevor ended up on Varsity as second-string quarterback even though he was so young. Davey and I were good, but not quite good enough for the main squad, so we were on the J.V. team along with Brandon. Sean and Todd didn’t arrive until just before school started along with everyone else since they had no interest in playing on the team. Sean’s relationship with his parents was actually better off now than it had been in any other timeline. The distance from them and their not looking over his shoulder all the time was helpful and he actually expressed a grudging change in his desire to see his father meet a grisly fate. Sometimes, distance does make the heart grow fonder. Our term as “Second-Class Cadets” went a lot smoother than our first half-year. We were now accepted by our year-mates as part of their class, and although we only took about half our classes with them, we were no longer strangers. The academic work was much more challenging, largely because our ‘core’ classes were taught in special classes with just the six of us, or sometimes some smaller mix (we all had varying levels of skills in mathematics, so Davey and I ended up in classes with Fourth-Year cadets while the rest were in their own special classes). Trevor enjoyed the football season, even if he only got to play in three games, and only for a total of three quarters. Not everything was perfect. Halfway through the year, Sean ended up before a disciplinary review board for fighting with a Third-Year cadet. The cadet in question was a bully, and had been physically harassing the smaller Sean when Sean unleashed his full fury on the older student. The bully hadn’t stood a chance and ended up in the infirmary with a broken nose while Sean suffered a few bruises. The end result of the disciplinary hearing was that both of them were punished for fighting, but the upper classman received the harsher punishment and a warning that further incidents would result in his removal from school. A much more serious situation arose in the middle of the baseball season. Todd played with us on the team, as did Davey, Brandon, and Trevor. After practice one day, Todd and Trevor disappeared into a little-used shed near the baseball fields and were in the middle of oral sex when a Fourth-Year cadet walked in, finding them. He threatened them with revealing what he’d seen to the faculty if they didn’t ‘service’ him on demand, but was interrupted by the sounds of Davey and I calling out for our friends. Hastily he told them to meet him back there the next day or he’d tell. Naturally Todd and Trevor told us what had happened, and we concocted a plan to deal with the upper classman. I ended up talking with an upper classman on the team after practice, one who we all suspected was gay from the way he took slightly longer looks at everyone in the shower, and we just happened to be walking by the shed as Trevor and Todd were pretty much pushed into the shed by Jason Howell, the cadet who was trying to blackmail them. “Oh no.” Bill Lindstrom, the Fourth-Year I was talking with growled. “What?” I asked. “Wasn’t that two of your friends with Howell?” He asked me. “Yeah.” I agreed, trying to hide my smile. “I can guarantee he’s up to no good.” Lindstrom stated and walked purposefully over to the shed, where we could hear an argument going on inside. “No, we won’t do it!” Trevor’s elevated voice was clearly audible. “I don’t care what you say to people, it’s your word against ours.” “You’ll damn well suck me off, you stupid cocksuckers!” Howell growled at them and Lindstrom got an angry look on his face as he threw the door open and stormed inside. Howell was standing there, his practice pants unbuttoned and half-hard cock flopped out while he stood facing Trevor and Todd. He turned around with a sneer on his face but blanched when he saw Lindstrom. “It’s not what it looks like! I caught these two…” “Stow it, Howell.” Lindstrom growled. “I covered for your ass when I caught you and that First-Year two years ago. Put that fucking thing back in your pants and I better never, ever hear of you harassing anyone again.” Howell stormed out, and I was amazed at our good fortune until Lindstrom turned back to my two friends who were smiling and he managed to give all three of us a glare. “Thank you.” Todd said quickly but was cut off by Lindstrom shaking his head. “Look, let me explain something to the lot of you, and you better sure as hell share it with your friends.” Lindstrom growled. “I know you six think you’re the hottest shit on this campus, but we’re not blind. It’s obvious as hell what you guys do with each other, but as long as you fucking keep it hidden, no one’s going to say anything. Guys like Howell, they’re just looking for a chance to fuck you guys over. You need to be more fucking careful where you do your shit, get it?” “Uh, yeah.” Trevor said with a slightly scared look on his face. “Um, thanks.” “Don’t fucking thank me.” Lindstrom growled. “Someone should have told you guys already. Just fucking tone it down and keep your shit private.” With that he turned and walked out. Later that night, we all had several long discussions and decided to try and tone things down a bit. We had been getting carried away, doing things in places where we could, and in this case, had been caught. After that, we kept it to our rooms, long after lights out for the most part, or managed to use each other as lookouts while the others had some fun. Christmas break of 1982 was fun, and 1983 rolled around without any big surprises for anyone. Davey was growing increasingly worried as the time frame got closer for when his father had started molesting his sister, but he’d done just about everything possible to forestall that from ever happening. He and his sister were a lot closer than they’d ever been before, and they actually corresponded by letter a lot during the school year. By the time summer rolled around, we were all ready for an extended break from the Academy, but Davey and I were a little unprepared for the changes the summer brought. First off, his family was moving in to a home just three doors down from my parents. Then, both of our fathers were gone most of the summer as their business began to take off, and they landed several major contracts with rental firms across the nation. They did take two weeks off towards the tale end of summer, and we were surprised by the trip to Europe. That was when we learned just how well the business was doing. Our families were on the verge of becoming millionaires, and were considering ‘going public’. This time around, there wasn’t likely going to be a need for us to win the lottery. Our families were going to handle that for us just fine. Our third year at the Academy went exceedingly well. In fact, it went way beyond our expectations. Academically, we were very challenged, and for the first time since coming back to this timeline, we all felt like we were being pushed to the full extent of our abilities. Our days were busy, and our nights were spent doing more studying than anything else. During the Spring semester of 1984, there was an elective course that we were allowed to take. The instructor was a retired analyst from the Soviet desk of the CIA. His course was “A History of the USSR and the Future of Communism.” One of the last assignments he gave us towards the end of the course was to write an essay, using full citation of at least eight sources, on what the future held for the Soviet Union. All six of us managed to independently write six essays on the fall of the Soviet Union. None of us collaborated, and although we used some of the same sources for citation, when we reviewed each other’s finished papers, they were different enough that it was obvious we’d each made our own efforts. While all of our conclusions were the same, each of us had reached them in slightly different ways that showed our different way of thinking. Two weeks before the end of the semester, and two weeks after we’d turned in the essays, we were all called into the Superintendent’s office. “Mr. Alstrom was very impressed with the papers each of you wrote.” The retired General said when we were all standing before him. “At first he suspected you’d helped each other with the papers, but after reviewing them he realized you had probably all discussed this topic with each other without having collaborated on what was to be an individual project. Is that correct?” “Yes, sir!” We all answered in unison. “That’s good, I’d hate to think of any of my cadets cheating.” He growled with a warning look at all of us. “Now, Mr. Alstrom was so impressed with your work, that he’s called a few of his friends. I know each of you are much younger than our normal Third-Year cadets, but that shouldn’t hamper your opportunities. When you graduate here after your fourth-year, you will be more than ready for whatever University you choose to attend. Mr. Alstrom has been good enough to cut through the red tape and get an offer extended for each of you to intern with his former employer over the summer. It won’t take up your entire summer, but will be for all but a few weeks. None of you are obligated to accept, but I would consider it a personal favor if as many of you as possible will accept. Young men your age rarely have an opportunity such as this. I won’t lie. Most of what you will be doing will be grunt work, delivering files, making coffee and the like, but you will still learn many things, even if none of you choose it as a career.” “I’ll accept, sir.” Davey said without hesitating. “My parents may not like it all that much, but Dad’s going to be pretty busy except for a few weeks towards the end of summer where he wants to go for another trip. As long as we don’t have to change that, things should work out.” “I’ll contact your parents to make the arrangements.” The General said with a nod and then he looked at me with a raised eyebrow. “Cadet Breckenridge, does this mean you will be going?” “Yes, sir, it does.” I said, and knew from the small smile and nod on his face that he damn well knew Davey and I were a couple, but said nothing. Maybe he thought it was ‘just a phase’, or didn’t even think about it at all, but he did know where one of us went, the other was not far behind. “Count us in too, sir.” Trevor said after sharing a few looks with Todd, whose eyes were bright at the idea of actually getting into the CIA building. “Good choice, gentlemen.” The General said with another short nod. “We might as well go too.” Sean said with a slight sigh. “Excellent.” The General said with a wider grin. “I’ll let Mr. Alstrom know all six of you have accepted. You can expect to receive further details over the next week. Dismissed.” The ‘further details’ amounted to a lot of documents about secrecy that we had to sign, and since we were minors, had to be signed by our parents. Most of what we did that summer really was grunt work. We delivered files, we made coffee, and similar things, but we also talked to several people whose job it was to analyze every bit of data collected about the Soviet Union. Most of them thought we were foolishly naïve children, but we laid some important seeds over the summer. That summer, Davey and I went with our families to West Germany, France, and Italy. It was odd, having traveled to a lot of these countries in other timelines, mostly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the European Union. The checkpoints at different borders that no longer existed after the mid-1990’s were a unique experience, especially after having spent most of the summer at the CIA. Our last year at the Academy was the toughest yet, with our instructors having spent most of the last few years learning our strengths and weaknesses. The school wasn’t really a big one, so they got to know all of their students fairly well, and they used that information mercilessly to challenge us in a variety of ways. In sports, Trevor was the starting quarterback, and even managed to attract the attention of a few college scouts, our faculty members had tipped off the scouts to this amazingly talented fifteen-year old who would be eligible for college next year. Nearly every week, we got at least two or three brochures for several top-notch universities and we began to discuss among ourselves what we would do for the future. That was why in late November of that year, after spending Thanksgiving at home with our families, we all met over at Trevor’s house the day before we were to fly back to school. His parents were both out, visiting some friends, and so we met in their dining room. We had all brought the tons of brochures and letters we’d received from various universities, colleges, and from various other institutions offering scholarships. “First off, I think we need to make a final decision on what to do about our dear friend, the mad scientist.” Sean said with a sarcastic drawl after we were all settled in at the table. “We can plant evidence that points to him working with the Soviets.” I offered. In the last timeline they had been hesitant to kill people, and even though they’d been on board for removal after coming back, offering this way out might be a better option for them. “He can’t invent time travel if he’s in jail for the rest of his life.” “Not good enough.” Sean disagreed with a shake of his head. “He can still do the mathematics, and we all know that with enough money anything is possible. Guys, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. None of you know the man the way I do. He’s obsessed with this, and nothing short of death will stop him. The only way I can see that we guarantee he and Shevardnadze do not meet up would be to make sure he is dead.” “Or Shevardnadze.” Davey added grimly as he nodded his head in agreement. “Of course, we won’t be able to get near Shevardnadze.” “No, which is why the man who first invented time travel is the one who has to die.” Sean said, taking back the discussion. “I think I know just how to do it too. A story in the news last year gave me a good idea. One of the things that bugged me about the guy is that he smokes like a chimney. There were a few times I had to go over to his house first thing in the morning. He’s had the same house since the 1960’s, this little two-bedroom thing built during the depression. The place stank like you wouldn’t believe, and the first thing he did when he got up every morning was to light up a cigarette even before he was out of bed.” “So?” Trevor asked with a confused look. “We know he doesn’t die of cancer.” “No, but he does have a gas stove.” Sean said grimly. “If we got in there, turned off the pilot light at night, made sure all the windows were closed, and left a burner on, he’d blow up when he had his morning smoke.” Davey said with a little grin on his face. “That’s a lot of if’s, there Sean.” “He has bad allergies some times.” Sean said with a shrug. “Part of the reason why the place stank so bad was that he never opens the windows to air it out. It’ll work. I know it.” “If it doesn’t, we can work on a fallback plan.” I offered. Everyone looked uncomfortable, but no one objected. “Now, which of us will do it, and when? We should make sure whoever goes has a good alibi just in case.” “What about his neighbors?” Todd asked with a frown. “Won’t we be risking hurting them too if his house just blows up?” “His nearest neighbor is several hundred yards away.” Sean said with a shrug. “They’ll be fine. And I’ll do it. I know the house. I’ve been in there in the other timeline.” “Won’t he hear you breaking in?” Trevor asked. “I’ve been thinking about this.” Sean said with a grin. “In the nineties, he always kept a spare key under the back door. I bet it’s there in this timeline too. He likes to make his assistants go get things that he might have left at home so he just leaves a spare key where they can find it easily. I’ll wait until he goes to bed, maybe an hour after that, and then I’ll go in, blow out the pilot light and leave the burner on. He’s always making tea in a kettle, so I’ll put the kettle over the burner, make it look like he’d left it on and didn’t realize it or something. That should be enough to throw any possible suspicion off it being foul play.” “What if you’re seen?” Brandon asked. “I don’t want you going to jail.” “I can do it without being seen.” Sean said confidently. “Besides, you guys will be my alibi, right?” “Yeah.” Davey said thoughtfully. “How about we do this over Spring Break? We’ve got that camping trip planned. All of us are planning to go to the DMV together and get our licenses right? And then we’ve already told our families we’re going camping for three days. That’ll give Sean one day to watch the place, and then another to actually do it.” “I’m going with him.” Brandon said fiercely and no one objected. “We’ll be able to give you both good alibis, especially if we go up on a back trail for most of the day.” Trevor added. “Okay, sounds like that’s settled. What’s next?” “College.” I said and everyone looked around nervously for a moment. “Look, I have to wonder if we’ve all been thinking along similar lines.” Trevor said after the silence had almost become uncomfortable. “Don’t get me wrong, I love all you guys. The thing is, we’ve been together, living together, working together, in each other’s pockets for damn near ten years now over two timelines. I’d like to be out on my own for a while, at least the four years it’ll take to finish up an undergraduate degree.” “What about me?” Todd asked with a mock pout and Trevor smiled while Brandon and Sean chuckled. “You know I don’t mean you in that.” Trevor said softly. “I’d just like it to be you and me for a bit, you know. Focus on us more, instead of the group.” “I’d like that too.” Todd agreed. “So would I.” Davey added as he looked at me. “No offense guys.” “It sounds like we’ve been thinking along the same lines.” Brandon chuckled. “So, what school have you picked, Trevor?” “USC.” Trevor said. “They offered me a football scholarship, and they’ve got that film program Todd’s been interested in since the last timeline. Brian, you always said you could work that into your plans.” “I can.” I agreed. “Good.” Todd said with a determined look. “What about you guys, Brandon and Sean?” “MIT, full-ride scholarships for both of us.” Sean said proudly as he held up two letters that he and Brandon had brought. “I’ve got engineering. It’ll be a nice change from Physics now that I don’t have to babysit that bastard again.” “Computer science for me.” Brandon added with a slight shrug. “This time I can get a proper education in the subject.” “Sorry about that.” I said quietly and he chuckled. “Wasn’t your fault, Bri.” Brandon stated. “They just didn’t have a halfway decent program.” “What about you two?” Sean asked with a slightly worried look. “You said you went to Stanford in your first timeline. You going to go there again?” “No.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “He went there so that I could pitch on the baseball team.” “Now there’s a joke.” Trevor chuckled as everyone else laughed. “Davey Jones pitching!” “Shut up.” Davey said defensively. Sure, he could throw a ball halfway decently after years and years of practice with us, but he was nowhere near being pitcher-quality in an amateur league, much less college ball. “We’re going to Whitman College.” I said to cut off the teasing Davey was getting. Everyone looked confused. “I’ve never heard of it.” Brandon stated. “It’s a CIA school.” Davey said. “Well, it’s a school with a program specific for the CIA.” “I thought you were staying away from the CIA after our little internship?” Brandon said to me with a confused look. “He’s doing it because I want to do it.” Davey said. “I like it. I want to do it.” “Which is why we’re going there.” I stated firmly. “But what about the long-range plans?” Trevor asked with a confused expression. “We abandoning them?” “No.” Davey said with a sigh. “I’ll have a couple years in by the mid-nineties, and Brian and I can go back to school, get our Masters degrees and then go over to State. It’s not like the mafia, really.” “If you think you can pull that off.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “Well, I guess that was pretty easy to do.” “Yeah, but don’t worry, we won’t lose touch with each other.” I assured them. “We’ve been through too much for that.” “No fucking shit.” Davey snorted, and we all laughed together before Trevor’s parents got home. Chapter 23 When we graduated from the Robinson Academy, we were part of a graduating class of sixty-three. All sixty-three graduates of the Academy went on to college, something not quite unusual for that school, but unusual in most public schools. Fourteen of those graduates went on to one of the four military Academies. Five (including Sean and Brandon) went to MIT. Most went to Ivy League schools like Yale or Harvard. Davey and I were the only two going to a little school in the heavily wooded area of Washington State where Whitman was located. Or rather, where we had planned to attend when we graduated. “This is weird.” Davey said as we unpacked our bags in the dorm room, two weeks before school started. “Yes, it is.” I agreed with him. We were both halfway through our sixteenth year, and freshmen about to begin our first year in college. “Did you see the house?” Davey asked me and I nodded. The dorm room was one of those on the top floor of the building, providing a spectacular view of the surrounding area. Well, it would be spectacular if you were the least bit interested. At least the dorm room we had been assigned was just the two of us instead of one of the bigger rooms. We had gotten here about an hour ago, and after doing our check-in were almost unpacked. “I did.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out as a sigh. I had not realized until I’d seen it how much I’d loved that house. “This is going to suck.” Davey said as he finished connecting the last connection on his computer and he sat down to boot it up. He had gotten his buzz cut freshened up back in Modesto before we’d left for college. We were supposed to let our hair grow out a bit more, but he’d complained about it itching too much and decided to see if he could get away with one more haircut before the fall semester started. “You want me to remind you it’s your fault?” I said in a tight voice and he actually laughed sharply before shaking his head. “Would it help if I said I was sorry?” He said as he turned around in his chair and gave me a pouting look. “Oh stop that.” I said with irritation and he smiled, knowing I’d already forgiven him. Damn it, what were they thinking? We were only sixteen! “Don’t worry, it’s not like we’re really sixteen.” He said after seeing the expression on my face. I gave another sigh, and nodded my head in agreement. Instead of arguing further I went over and hugged him, giving him a kiss on the top of the head. “I’m going to go for a walk.” I said gently and he nodded as his computer finished booting up and he turned back around. He’d already hooked up the phone line to the 4,800 baud modem and would be making sure everything worked just fine. Shutting the door behind me I went out and took the elevator down to the first floor. With a nod for the sleepy student at the front desk I left the building, barely wincing as the heat hit me like a wall. I’d survived Arizona before, and while I wasn’t happy to be back here instead of nice, cool Washington, it wasn’t going to kill me. We were here early, and except for some athletes, most of the campus was still fairly empty as I walked around the familiar environs of Arizona State. To be honest, I was feeling a little lonely without Trevor, Brandon, Sean, and Todd around. We had made other friends at Robinson, but the six of us had been a fairly insular group for all those years. Now it was just Davey and me here at this school. Both Sean and Brandon had been remote ever since Spring Break, when the two of them had left our campsite for the mission in Livermore. They’d returned very quiet, and had barely spoken a word the rest of the weekend except to say that they were successful. We’d all been quiet for the rest of the week with the realization that we’d all contributed to the killing of another human being, who had not yet done anything. Trevor had confirmed it for us, by speaking with his father when we returned. Trevor had brought up a story in talking with his father about how a student at the Academy had been caught smoking in his room. His father had shaken his head, and commented that smoking was stupid and dangerous. One of his co-workers at the lab had died just a few days before when his pilot light had gone out during the night, and the man had woken up and lit a cigarette. That was all the confirmation we’d needed, and towards the end of summer we’d all breathed a sigh of relief when we’d not heard anything more or any whisper that the death had raised suspicions. After making a circuit of the central part of the campus, I made my way up, past the dormitories and by the stadium. Memories of Trevor playing football there came to the forefront of my mind, and I shook my head while a half-smile flitted onto my face. As much as I wanted to be mad at Davey for getting us into this… situation, I could not really blame him. The Davey Jones I had first met in my original timeline had over a century of experiences behind him, and he’d done just about everything he’d ever dreamed of doing, except maybe making it into space. When I came back in time, I’d known that there would be a lot of challenges, and one of those would be that the Davey Jones I was meeting would not have had those experiences. Davey had told me, in the original timeline, that he’d craved adventure and excitement when he was younger. That had led him into many interesting experiences. In my first trip back in time, Davey had been patient, but after Sean had come back he’d gotten a taste of being involved with ‘the big picture’ in a direct way, and I knew that deep down part of him craved something similar in this timeline. That was why I’d pushed him and my friends to the Robinson Academy. I’d hoped it’s ‘military’ elements would keep him satisfied, but they’d just fed his hunger for something more, and so now here we were, involved with America’s spy agency. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I hoped it wouldn’t have too many effects on the long-range plans for the future. It shouldn’t, but as I’d already learned, the future wasn’t written and even the most prepared or experienced time traveler could run into the unexpected. “You’re back!” Davey said when I came back to our dorm room. He got out of the chair in front of the computer and crossed over to hug me as soon as I’d closed the door behind me. “You smell good.” I said as I caught the scent of the cologne he was wearing. “You’re sweaty, and you smell good too.” Davey said in a familiar, husky tone. Even as I leaned forward a bit more to kiss him comfortably, I could feel him hardening in his jeans. By the time we were done, we were both sweaty, and feeling very good as we laid together on one of the narrow dorm beds. It was a good thing we had four years of practice sleeping together in small beds at the Academy. “I like it when you greet me like that.” I said as I ran a finger along his side. He shivered slightly at the touch. “So you forgive me for getting you into this?” He asked in a very soft tone. “Yes.” I said without hesitation. “Sorry, you know how I get when plans get changed.” “You and your plans.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. It was probably his biggest frustration with me. I didn’t react well when my plans were de-railed or sidetracked. “I’ll get over it like I always do.” I said as I reached around discovered to my joy that he was ready for another round. He sighed as my hand began to stroke him gently. “I love it when you do that.” He said quietly, and it was another hour before we were walking down the hallway to the showers. Two football players were in there, and greeted us with nods before heading out. That night we ate at a restaurant on Mill Avenue before heading to the theater where we watched a movie both of us had already seen in another timeline. Then we headed back to the dorm room. We could have easily afforded the house, or other off-campus living quarters, but our ‘handler’ at the CIA wanted us to live on-campus. Thus we were going to get the ‘full’ experience on campus this year. We were even being encouraged to pledge a frat if the opportunity arose. Davey seemed to like the idea, and if he wanted it, I’d go along with him. “Brian, I’m excited.” Davey said later that night as we lay together in one of the two beds. “Excited?” I asked. “Yeah, excited.” Davey said with a sigh. “Sorry, it’s just, you know, I’ve got this feeling like anything can happen. I know you put a lot of time and effort into your plans, and they’re good plans, but I feel like right now anything can happen and that excites me. Part of me feels like we’re going to be getting to go to school for real now, unlike last time. With all the others around, last time felt like just an extension of high school, but now it’s just us and that’s exciting.” “I understand.” I told him gently and he snuggled up tighter against me. His breathing became regular as he drifted off to sleep, and I was falling asleep soon after. The next morning we had our interview with Professor Lee. He looked no different than he had in the last timeline, and we spent a good hour sitting in his office talking in nothing but Russian. That had been one of our courses for the last four years, giving us both a good reason for being proficient in the language. After we were done, he had signed off on putting us in the advanced-level language courses. With that mission accomplished, we headed back downtown to the coffee shop that we’d enjoyed with our friends in the last timeline. Then, our families showed up in the late afternoon, and we went out with all of them. Jenny was fourteen now, getting ready to start high school. Her parents had offered to send her to a boarding school, but she insisted on going to Downey. Last year, the company our parents started had gone public, and at least on paper they were now millionaires with their stock options. By and large, they hadn’t changed how they lived much, and even Davey’s mother was trying to live her life as if not much had changed, but they did enjoy a few things, like staying at the more expensive Biltmore Resort while in Phoenix, and going out to dinner at the more expensive restaurants in town. They stayed for three days before heading back, and Davey and I got down to business preparing for the upcoming semester. The truth is, I love school. I enjoy learning, even if it’s learning something over again. Each time is a little different, and the classes I had that first semester were all slightly different than those I’d had in the last timeline, and of course different than those I’d had at Stanford. Another thing I had discovered is that while some schools have a deserved reputation for excellence in education, the quality of any education, at any school depended on two primary factors: The desire, or motivation, of the teacher to actually teach and the desire of the student to learn. The finest teacher, with the finest materials, the best-prepared curricula and lessons plans, and the absolute finest in teaching aides is wasted if a student has no desire to learn. Likewise, the best-prepared, highly motivated, eager student is wasting his time if the teacher in front of him has no desire to really teach. Good textbooks, lab equipment, support staff, office hours, money for extra materials and other supporting mechanisms are important, but given two bare essentials: a good teacher and a good student, it is possible to achieve the best in education with little else. That was one of Arizona State’s greatest resources: their professors. For the most part, their professors were eager to teach, and knew their subjects very well. While at many other institutions of higher learning, research was the main goal of professors, here there was still a strong ethos of instructing amongst the professors. By carefully selecting certain professors, both Davey and I managed to construct a course schedule for the first year that kept us interested in our courses. We also developed friendships with several other students. By its very nature, the university’s foreign language programs tended to produce tight-knit groups of students. Studying a language effectively took more than going to class and doing the assigned homework. Watching movies in that language, reading literature in that language, and actually holding conversation in the language was necessary to move from a basic proficiency into actual competence. Many of the students we joined that year had been studying the language together for three years already, and while at first we were interlopers, they quickly grew to accept us as part of their group. Of those students, they were all in their early to mid-twenties, and so there was a slight age gap between us at first, especially when they would go out drinking on the weekends, but as the semester stretched on, it became less of a barrier. Davey and I went home to Modesto for Thanksgiving, and our families seemed to enjoy the tales we had to tell of life at ASU. Davey’s father practically beamed with pride at having his son go to that school. The man was not the same as the David Jones Sr. who had become President, but he was closer to that man than the one in the previous timeline. Davey was understandably proud of him. It was Davey’s mother who cast a little cloud over the holiday with a single comment. “Now that you boys are at a school with girls, have either of you started dating yet?” His mother asked us with a piercing look. My parents looked a little uncomfortable, having figured us out long ago, but his parents were still largely in the dark about the true nature of our relationship. “Mom!” Davey exclaimed with a slight blush. “The youngest girls at ASU are all eighteen or older! I’m jailbait to them!” “Oh.” His mother said with a worried frown. “What about girls from one of the high schools?” “I go to college.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “What mother is going to want her daughter dating a college student?” “That might be a problem.” His mother said with a shake of her head. “Don’t worry, son.” Davey’s father said with a smile. “In just over a year you’ll be eighteen. Plenty of time for that.” “Thanks dad.” Davey said with a shake of his head. His hair, like mine was growing out a bit, and we both needed at least a trim to keep our hair looking neat. We managed to hook up with our friends the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and we all spent most of the day up at Don Pedro Reservoir, sitting in a rented boat in the middle of the lake and talking about the last few months. None of us were extensive letter-writers, and e-mail was still a few years away as a means for us to communicate. Davey and I had a phone in our dorm room, but we were the only couple that had that luxury. So, we spent the day catching up with our friends. “We miss you guys.” Todd said about halfway through the day. “But, well, it’s like we’re learning how to make other friends at school. It’s kind of weird, like maybe that when we were all together we didn’t really need other people so we shut them out. Don’t take it the wrong way, but it’s nice making new friends again.” “It is.” Davey agreed. “Just don’t think we’re going to forget you guys, though.” “No, we’ll always be the best of friends.” Sean agreed while everyone nodded. When we returned to Arizona, almost everyone was focused on the upcoming finals. They were weeks away, and there were still parties every weekend that we both managed to attend. We had gotten invitations to pledge several frats on campus, but Davey had decided (wisely in my opinion) that he didn’t really want to be a ‘frat’. Both of us were certain we’d done well on our finals, and we left Arizona for the extended winter break. Unlike the last timeline, we weren’t taking Winter Session courses, and so we stayed in Modesto from late December all the way until the weekend before Spring Semester started. Our parents now had a big office in downtown Modesto, and we began to realize just how big their business was growing. Dad had mentioned they’d taken the company public a few months ago, but our Christmas presents included stock in their company. When we realized the stock we had been given was valued at nearly a million dollars for each of us, I was floored. This was far better than providing a winning lottery ticket had been. The one troubling point was Davey’s mother and grandmothers both throwing girls at him the entire time we were back in Modesto. He even went on two ‘dates’, and I’d commiserated with him over the awful time he’d had on the dates. Davey wanted to wait until he was eighteen though, before telling them the truth about our relationship. It would make dealing with any fallout from them easier. When school started up, it was proving to be a hectic semester. The other students in our Russian courses were by and large preparing to go to the Soviet Union for the summer. The university’s Russian language program had managed to once again obtain approval from both governments for a summer-length study program at Moscow State University. Many of the students from our classes would be spending the summer there. Davey and I were still too young, by a year, to go, but we knew that next year would be our year to take part in the program. That was why we’d been sent to ASU in the first place. By the end of the semester, we’d managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA, and fully establish ourselves as regular, if a little young, students at ASU. During the summer, Davey and I spent several weeks at an ‘intensive’ Slavic-language program being offered by Rutgers. Davey was in a staged ‘accident’ that resulted in him needing to have some plastic surgery. At first I didn’t like the way his nose had been changed, or the slightly different shape of his eyes, but the changes grew on me after a while. “Dude, I like the new nose.” Trevor said when we met up with him and Todd over the summer. Brandon and Sean were taking summer session courses at MIT, and we’d just missed them by two days. “Shut up.” Davey responded to Trevor sharply. He’d always been a little sensitive about his nose, and now that it was narrower, and no longer had that little ‘hump’ halfway down, I could see him staring at himself in the mirror a lot. His eyes were more almond-shaped now as well, but the changes were less immediately noticeable. “So, other than your face getting smashed up, everything else is alright after your car accident?” Todd asked in a slightly worried tone. “Yes, everything’s fine.” Davey assured our old friends. Not even they were to be told yet about the real reasons why the surgery had happened. For that matter, we didn’t even know the full story yet. Phoenix was still hot when we returned for the new semester. Sure, Modesto got hot during the summer months, but it never got quite as hot as Phoenix. Once again we got a good dorm room and went through the typical routine of unpacking and setting our room up for the next year. Within a few days we were settled in and ready to begin the next round of classes. Last year, we’d finished the highest level of undergraduate Russian language courses that were regularly offered, so this year we were given special upper-division classes where we studied under two professors. We also were assigned as ‘assistants’ to the beginning-level courses, and as the months wore on, found ourselves making a fairly lucrative business in tutoring some students. Most of the students we tutored were freshmen, and were usually only a year or two older than us. That led to a situation that had me very nervous, and caused one of the most serious arguments yet. Matt Stoler was a handsome young man, eighteen, and he kept looking at Davey in a way that made me very nervous. Worse yet, Davey responded to his smiles with smiles of his own, and the body language between the two of them was far more friendly than made me comfortable. “Brian, you worried about me and Todd when we first got together.” Davey said with a hint of scorn in his voice when I broached the topic. “After all these years I’d have thought you could learn to trust me by now.” “I do trust you.” I told him. “I don’t trust Matt.” “It takes two to tango, Brian.” Davey said in a warning tone. His statement worked both ways, really. He was telling me that nothing would happen because he wouldn’t let it, and he was telling me that it took both of us to make our relationship work, or to not work.” “You’re right.” I said with a sigh. “I’m sorry. It’s just that, well, you look so damn good I know you could have any guy you wanted…” “I only want you, Brian.” He said in a tone that made my heart melt. That night I was sure our neighbors heard what we were doing, but we didn’t really care. It was too much fun. It was the day before we left for Thanksgiving when something happened that affirmed my reasons for worrying. Davey was tutoring Matt in our dorm room while I was out supervising a make-up exam for Professor Lee. It was an oral exam, with the students having to recite several poems, and afterwards I spent an extra half-hour with two of them, helping them to fix their pronunciation of certain words. After I was done, I headed back to our dorm room, and was just opening the door when I heard the familiar sounds of two people kissing. There was Davey and Matt, whose back was to me, kissing on my bed! Instead of erupting and making a scene, I started to close the door with a sinking heart when Matt fell to the floor. With the door just open a crack, I couldn’t see much, but I could hear what was being said, and my heart started to climb back out of my feet. Matt was on the floor because Davey had pushed him there. “What do you think you’re doing?” Davey snarled angrily. “I… uh… I thought you were…” Matt stammered with real fright in his voice. “You thought what?” Davey snarled again. “I thought you were… you know… like me.” Matt stammered even more. “You know… gay.” “Yeah, I’m gay.” Davey stated with anger dripping off of every syllable. “What makes you think you can kiss me, though?” “I’m sorry.” Matt said softly. “I just thought if you were gay, you wouldn’t mind hooking up. I mean, everyone says you and Brian are both gay.” “We’re a couple.” Davey said firmly. “I’m not interested in anyone but him. If you knew that we were gay, what made you think I’d cheat on him?” “You’re a guy, aren’t you?” Matt shot back and Davey laughed. “Just because I’m a guy, don’t think that means I’ll cheat on someone I love.” Davey said around his laughter. “Brian and I have been together for longer than you’d believe, and I’m not about to risk my relationship with him, no matter how cute someone is.” “You think I’m cute?” Matt said in a pleased tone. “You’re easy enough on the eyes.” Davey said. “Brian’s better though.” “Oh.” Matt said softly. “I’m sorry I misunderstood.” “Just don’t try something like that again.” Davey said firmly, and I walked away from the room. When I came back an hour later, Davey smiled as I handed him a dozen red roses. “You heard, didn’t you?” Davey asked with a smile. “Yep.” I admitted with a slight blush. “What did you see?” Davey asked curiously. “I opened the door when he was kissing you.” I was blushing furiously now. “And you didn’t make a scene?” Davey asked with a tilt of his head. “I heard you push him to the floor, and stayed around to hear the rest of the conversation.” I admitted, looking at the floor. “So you know you can trust me, don’t you?” Davey said softly, but there was an edge to his voice. “Yes, and I’m sorry I ever doubted you.” I said softly. “You were right though, too, about what he was after.” Davey gave me that much. “Thanks for the roses.” “They’re not half as beautiful as you.” I said, and that got me a very deep, passionate kiss. It was the day after Thanksgiving when Trevor’s father called Davey and invited us to his house that evening. Davey and I were both a little confused when we arrived and found that Trevor and Mrs. Rush were both gone, and two men were waiting with Mr. Rush. We recognized one of them as the ‘handler’ we’d been working with from the CIA. “Mr. Breckenridge, Mr. Jones, this is Walter Ameson, my supervisor.” Richard Long, the handler introduced us to the older man with white hair. “I was surprised when Mr. Long called me and said he needed my help.” Mr. Rush said as we all sat back down. “It has been some years since I had contact with the Agency. I was more surprised when I found out you two boys were involved with them. You have not gotten Trevor involved in whatever this is, have you?” “No, sir.” Davey said cautiously while Long nodded. “What’s going on?” “You two young men have expressed an interest in working with the Agency while you were still in High School.” Ameson explained. “I believe you both remember your summer internships. Your group of friends and you had some strange ideas, but they are starting to appear not to be as far-fetched as we first assumed. Unfortunately, our operations are not geared towards obtaining the kind of information we would need to verify some of the theories that are now being kicked around by our analysts. That is where you come in, Mr. Jones.” “Me?” Davey asked with surprise. “Yes, you.” Mr. Long added. “You’ve been very good about doing what we ask without demanding an explanation. Now, your patience is about to pay off.” “We were quite nervous when Mr. Long brought up this idea, especially since it centered on such a young person.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “Still, you appear to be quite an unusual young man, very mature, and we are going to take this risk.” “What risk?” Davey asked cautiously. “Davey, you were born here in Modesto, right?” Mr. Rush asked. “Yes, at Modesto City Hospital.” Davey stated. “Trevor was born at the same hospital.” Mr. Rush stated. “It was six weeks after you, as you know.” “Yes.” Davey murmured. “My wife and I were at the hospital the same night you were born.” Mr. Rush said and Davey’s eyebrows rose. “In fact, I think I remember seeing your mother brought in to the Labor and Delivery area. She was quite…vocal about wanting you out of her.” “I can imagine.” Davey said with a slightly stunned look on his face. I was surprised too, since this was the first I’d heard of it in three timelines. Trevor’s parents had been there the night Davey was born? “Do you not wonder why we were at the hospital?” Mr. Rush asked and Davey nodded. “You see, my sister was pregnant at almost the same time as my wife. They were only a month apart.” “I’ve never met your sister.” Davey said quietly. “She died in childbirth.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “I’m sorry.” Davey said immediately and Mr. Rush shrugged it off. “She went into labor three weeks early.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “She didn’t know it, but she was bearing twins. Something went wrong inside of her, and she went into labor prematurely. The first boy was delivered without too much trouble, but the second had gotten the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck during the birth process. The hospital was a mess that night with your mother and three other women, all giving birth at the same time. The twins were fraternal, not identical. You do understand the difference?” “Fraternal are from different eggs inseminated at the same time instead of one egg that splits into two separate embryos.” Davey said automatically. “Yes.” Mr. Rush continued. “The second twin died before he could be delivered by emergency cesarean section. My sister also died later that night.” “I’m very sorry.” Davey said quietly. “What happened to the one that survived?” “He was returned to his father.” Mr. Rush frowned. “I am still sorry about that.” Mr. Ameson said to Mr. Rush. “He found out about the delivery and there was nothing we could do to prevent it when he made the demand.” “What does…” Davey began to ask, mostly to cover the fact we already knew Mr. Rush was a defector. In this timeline we were not supposed to know that. “I was not born in the United States.” Mr. Rush said, in Russian. Davey and I both managed to put appropriate expressions of surprise on our faces. “Sereosna?” Davey asked in Russian, the word for ‘seriously’. “Pravda.” Mr. Ameson replied with a slight smile. Simply put, he was saying it was ‘truth’. “My wife and I came to the United States because we did not want our child born under communism.” Mr. Rush continued in English. Then he told the story we’d heard before, except this time we found out that his sister had come with him. From the expression on his face, I could understand why that had never been mentioned before. It seemed the memory was very painful for him, and it explained why he had very rarely spoken of it in any of the timelines. His sister had been a secretary for a mid-level bureaucrat in the Foreign Affairs office. She had helped them arrange their defection, and gone with them. The father of her unborn children was an older man, who would now be in his early sixties, and had not had any children by his wife. After the mother had died in childbirth, he had demanded his son be returned to him, and legally there had been no way to stop him short of creating an international incident. “The boy, Dmitry Verakov, died about a year ago in an auto accident while vacationing in Eastern Europe.” Mr. Ameson continued the story after Mr. Rush fell silent. He took out a picture from a briefcase next to his chair and showed it to us. Several things fell into place at once. “You want to use Davey to get close to this man.” I said while Davey stared at the picture. The young guy in the picture was handsome, and he looked a lot like Davey, in fact, with the changes to Davey’s appearance, I’d have very few doubts they were brothers. “Did the other twin really die?” Davey asked in quiet voice, and Mr. Long chuckled. “Are you thinking maybe you were adopted?” He asked Davey with a very amused expression. “This guy looks a lot like me.” Davey said, pointing at the picture. “Not only that, he has the same blood type as you.” Mr. Ameson added. “Although, if a genetic test were to be done, you’d find that you do not really share his genetics. It is just a fortuitous resemblance, and the fact that your blood type is the same is an even bigger stroke of luck.” “So I’m not really…” Davey’s voice drifted off. “No, you are no relation to Mikhail Markovich Verakov, although when he sees you we believe that he will suspect a great deal.” Mr. Ameson stated. “A check of your blood type will prove that you could be his son, and that will likely be enough for him. He is currently a high-level assistant to the Politburo member responsible for overseeing domestic production of consumer goods in the Soviet Union. As such, he has access to much of the economic data that we have failed to acquire.” “You want me to get him to defect?” Davey asked. “If it’s possible.” Ameson stated. “If not, wiggle your way into his life, his home, and learn as much as you can. Pass that information to Mr. Breckenridge, who will bring it back to the United States. Make Verakov believe that you are his lost son. His wife died two years ago, and his son last year. He is a very lonely man right now.” “And the whole idea is just plain insane.” Davey said with disbelief. “What makes you think I can do this?” “Please, Mr. Jones, you’re quite capable of hiding secrets.” Mr. Long said with a snort. “It took us until two months ago to verify that you and Mr. Breckenridge are homosexuals in a long-term relationship. We still have not been able to find out when that relationship started. Three FBI agents doing background checks on you both failed to uncover that information.” “Matt.” Davey said flatly and Mr. Long grinned. “He didn’t know who he was doing it for, just that he was being paid to see if he could seduce you.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “That is why we are including Mr. Breckenridge in this. We assume you will not wish to go without him.” “Aren’t you worried that Verakov will find out and get mad?” Davey asked. “When it comes to the children of powerful men like him, the Soviet Union will often turn a blind eye.” Ameson stated. “Well, that or they’ll seek to use it as a hammer hanging over his head if he steps out of line. No, both of you should be quite safe when they find out about your relationship.” “You make it sound like it is for certain.” I stated. “Yes, Mr. Breckenridge.” Long said with a grin. “Both of your files will indicate that you were rejected for service with the Agency because of your sexual preference. It is the policy of the United States that homosexuals are not to be trusted.” “But you trust us.” I stated with a raised eyebrow. “Call me an enlightened individual.” Long said with a shrug. “You both are very unique individuals.” Ameson added. “We would not normally even think of such a hairbrained scheme as this, but you are both fairly mature, obviously able to keep secrets without looking like you’re keeping secrets, and have shown yourselves to be dependable. If you accept this plan, this will be the last time we officially meet. The two of you will apply for the Study Abroad program that is scheduled for next summer. You will both be eighteen by then, and legal adults.” “While you are there, you will be invited to attend several events.” Long continued. “At least one of those will be attended by comrade Verakov. He often gets sent in the place of his boss. Make sure that you meet him, and if possible speak to him. Let him take things from there. Mr. Jones, you will use Mr. Breckenridge to pass any information learned out of the Soviet Union. We suggest that if an offer for you to stay with comrade Verakov is made, that you accept. Mr. Breckenridge should be able to pass back and forth between the United States and the Soviet Union every few months.” “Mr. Breckenridge, you will pass your information along through Mr. Rush.” Ameson took up the explanation. “We suggest you write nothing down, nor take any incriminating photographs. Both of you have shown that your memory is near-perfect. That is the safest way for you to pass information to each other. Mr. Rush can put it in written form, and send the reports in through his regular channels.” “You will both be paid for your work, if this succeeds.” Long finished. “We will protect your identities by listing you as being denied for service, but Mr. Rush will receive a significant raise in his living allowance that we pay him. When this is over, I believe you both trust him enough to pay you appropriately.” “We trust him.” Davey didn’t hesitate to reply but he got a worried look on his face. “How long am I supposed to do this for?” “Until Mr. Verakov dies, retires, or the Soviet Union ceases to exist.” Ameson stated and Davey looked at me with a worried expression. “Brian?” “It’s up to you.” I told him. “You’re the one who wanted to get involved with the bloody Agency.” “I… you know… I… uh… I can’t do this. Sorry.” Davey stammered after a moment. “Why not?” Ameson asked with a frown. “I… Brian doesn’t really want to be involved in this cloak and dagger stuff and I won’t drag him along.” Davey said. “You’re right, we are a couple, and we’d have to do this together or not at all.” “Thank you, Davey.” I said quietly, putting a hand on his shoulder and not caring about the other men in the room. “But you know you want to do this, don’t you?” “Yes, but…” Davey protested. “We’ll do it.” I said to Ameson who nodded, although he was obviously trying not to look at my hand on Davey’s shoulder. “Why?” Long said. “It’ll help our country, and Davey really wants to do it.” I said with a shrug. “I like spoiling him.” “I love you.” Davey breathed out in a whisper, and he was smiling from ear to ear. Chapter 24 It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.”",

      "content": "“We’re all twelve now, right?” I asked and got nods all around. “Should we be having sex?” Brandon asked. “Well, it’s not like we weren’t playing around at this age anyway.” Trevor said, but then he gave me a look. “Well, most of us were anyway.” “Aren’t we all like virgins again?” Todd asked. “I know I am.” “So am I, physically.” Sean said, but he was grinning at Brandon. “For right now, at least.” “So am I, but I don’t see why we shouldn’t have fun.” I said with a shrug. “I mean, we’re all pretty established in our relationships, right?” “Yeah, that’s for sure.” Davey said with a smile. “Just remember, coming out right now isn’t going to be fun or easy.” Sean reminded all of us. “My parents, and Davey’s at least will have conniption fits and we’re too young to get emancipated yet.” “I hate being young again.” Davey moaned. “You lose so many privileges that being an adult gets you.” “It takes some adjustment.” I agreed. “Some of us have it easier than others, and we should make sure our families get used to us spending a lot of time together. For now, my place, or Trevor’s will be the best place to get together as a group.” “Oh yeah, a lot of trips to the barn.” Brandon said with a leer at Sean. “You really are cute at this age, you know. Then again you’re cute at any age.” “You’re just saying that because your twelve-year old hormones are talking.” Sean teased back, but he was smiling as the bell rang. “Ah, crap, we got class.” Trevor groaned, and we all headed into the school as a group. A few of our ‘friends’ from this time gave us odd looks because Todd, Sean and Davey weren’t normally part of our group, but they’d get used to that in time. Time. We had so much time to plan now, and while it was true I hadn’t been able to do more than lay out the basic elements of how to secure access to the time machine and get us all back here, but I had spent plenty of time over the last years in that other timeline planning on what to do when we got here. First off was to get reestablished in our younger bodies, and our younger lives. There were other things to take care of, but that would take a little bit longer. I intended to make sure that no other time machine could be built, and to do that someone would have to die. The easiest would be the scientist. While my friends had by and large balked at the idea of killing the soldiers and others that would be in the chamber with us, I had been able to adapt those plans to non-lethal means. Sean and Davey, though, had shown no squeamishness at killing, and they would be the ones to help me with the plans for the scientist that had started this whole chain of events. We had years, though, before we needed to take those steps. For now, the most important thing was to just enjoy the fact that instead of being a lonely time traveler, we were all in our younger bodies, and we all remembered our friendships and relationships with each other. There would be no dancing around, trying to reestablish what had been begun in a previous timeline. I just did my best to not think about certain things that couldn’t be changed. Uncle Rich already had AIDS, and he’d die around Christmastime this year. Going back earlier might have changed that, but the fact was we knew that at this age our bodies were able to handle the adult memories of past lives. Going back further endangered that, as Davey learned in my original timeline. Saving Uncle Rich just wasn’t worth that risk. First period English was fun, but jock math was absolute hell for me. By whispered agreement, those of us in that class (Trevor, Davey, and I) agreed we’d get out of it after the first week and into a more advanced math. Davey joined Brandon, Trevor and me for lunch, while Sean and Todd visited with some of their old friends. While we were all good friends as young adults, the truth was that we moved in different circles during Junior and Senior High, and while we were going to be making many changes, they didn’t all need to start on the first day. After practice we all met in a nearby park, sitting together at one of the wooden benches that dotted the area. We had the area pretty much to ourselves, and wouldn’t have to worry about a parent coming in and hearing us talk about things they wouldn’t be prepared to understand. It was pretty obvious the younger hormones were kicking in, because there was a lot of physical contact between the various couples as we sat down to talk. “Ugh, this is going to drive me insane.” Trevor groaned as Todd sat next to him. “You’ve got a barn, invite me to dinner.” Todd teased him and Trevor growled. “You’re coming to dinner.” “Geez, twist my arm, why don’t ya?” Todd laughed. “Where are we going?” Sean asked Brandon. “There’s some bushes over there.” Brandon said with a jerk of his head. “We have those reserved.” Davey added. “Business first?” I asked, hating to break up the horny banter. I knew only part of it was from actual horniness. Most came from the fact that we’d succeeded in fooling several powerful people over several very tense years. “Yeah, okay, how do we prevent World War III?” Davey asked in a mock-serious tone. “We kill the bad Russian.” Trevor offered. “Better yet, we kill the scientist.” Todd offered. “Um, didn’t you guys hesitate at…” I started to suggest but Brandon shook his head. “That was different.” Brandon said. “Those guys were innocent.” “Yeah.” Trevor agreed. “Yup.” Todd added. “Well, we’ve got years before that is necessary.” I pointed out. “In fact, we should probably wait until we’re at least sixteen or seventeen and don’t have to depend on others for transportation.” “But you have an idea about how to do it, right?” Davey asked. “I’m thinking either a car accident, or poison.” I admitted. “I’d lean towards car accident but we have to make sure it’s fatal. We’ll spend a few months observing him and his movements, and work out a more exact plan once we’re older. They don’t come back until 1988, remember?” “That’s right, so there’ll be in plenty of time.” Sean smiled. “Okay, so what about between now and then?” Trevor asked. “Do we just lay low, be normal students or whatever, keep the fact that we’re fucking like bunnies a secret and just live life or do we do something?” “Sean, you said when you came back that my plans to help alleviate the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union didn’t work.” I stated. “Is it fair to say the problem was what I expected, that there wasn’t enough time between 1988 and 1991?” “That was what you decided before I came back.” Sean answered. “You said ground work would have to be made several years earlier in order to get a better impact.” “So, a question for all of us.” I said and was glad that the playfulness had died down. Everyone was as serious as could be right now. “Do we live our lives as normally as possible, not showing we already know what we’re learning in classes, or do we do something different?” “You’re not talking about admitting to the government we’re time travelers, are you?” Davey asked suspiciously. “Hell no.” I snorted. “That’s just asking for trouble, especially once they believe us. No. You know, we’re just an extraordinary group of geniuses who manage to learn very fast and learn at a very accelerated rate. If we play it right, we can be finishing up high school by the time we’re fifteen, and we can be in the right schools, at the right time to advance the right theories to the right people a few years earlier.” “But, our friends…” Todd started to protest and then he sighed. “Why do I see your faces being in my future for decades?” “We’ll make other friends along the way, but at least we’ll always have each other to fall back on.” Davey said with an appreciative look on his face. “I mean, think about what we’ve been through, what we’ve done. I know all of you will always be important to me for the rest of my life.” “Aw, how sweet.” Sean said in a mock-moan, but everyone had embarrassed smiles on their faces. “So how do we do this?” Trevor asked. “I mean, is there anyone who isn’t onboard with this idea?” “Nope.” Several of them said at once. Then everyone looked at me again. Even though Sean had come back in the last timeline, I was still the ‘oldest’ of them, and had all the knowledge of the original Davey Jones at my recall. “For now, we just ace every quiz, every test and we make it very obvious to our teachers that we’re extremely bored with their work.” I explained easily. “They should get the hint within a month, and if any of them don’t we’ll take other steps through my aunt. Their next step should be to give us new assessment tests, where we’ll do everything but the absolutely most difficult questions. I don’t think any of us except maybe Davey and Trevor will have problems with the math parts.” “Yeah, I might fail that part.” Davey said with a chortle. He’d always hated math. “That should give the teachers a conundrum to deal with, and we’ll probably be accused of cheating.” I continued with a laugh. “So, we’ll probably end up taking the tests again, and we should perform about the same. After a lot of head scratching, our parents will probably come talk to us about skipping a grade or two. Maybe even sending all of us to a special school. We should end up freshmen somewhere, and from there it’ll be a few years until we get our high school diplomas and move on to college.” “No sports then.” Trevor said with a frown. “Well, we might be able to figure something out there, although we’ll definitely be at a disadvantage with our lack of development.” I said with a shrug. “We can always do three-on-three.” Davey said, and then blushed as a few of the guys chuckled. “Sorry, not on our backs.” “Don’t get kinky, Jones.” Todd grumbled playfully. “What careers do we get this time?” Sean asked. “I mean, I like physics and all, but I’d really like to go into computers.” “I really want to focus on computers too.” Brandon added. “Some of the stuff that was coming out there before we left, it was pretty damn cool.” “I want to do the political stuff again.” Davey said with a smile and then he shrugged when everyone groaned. “Hey, I like it!” “I know.” Todd added. “I’m not sure what I want to do right now.” “Me neither.” Trevor added. “We don’t have to decide now.” I reminded them. “You’ve got a year or two. Remember, we’re going to know more than other kids our age, but that doesn’t necessarily make us geniuses. We’re still going to have to learn things, but we’ll have a head start. That’s the main thing to remember. When we get back into college, it’ll be slower going again.” “Got it.” Trevor murmured. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, Todd needs to see my barn and what it looked like in 1981.” “Have fun.” Davey leered at them and he grinned at me. “Want to walk me home, Brian? You might not know this, but your place is on the way to where I live now.” “Sure.” I agreed while Brandon and Sean got up, heading for some bushes without even a word to us. “I do love you.” Davey said softly as we began the walk home. “You know, I’ve got some changes to make with my father.” “Stopping him from molesting Jenny, yes.” I agreed. “If we leave too soon for some advanced school, I won’t be able to do that.” Davey said. “Any suggestions on how to go about this?” “Start with Jenny.” I offered and he nodded. “You mean talk to her about inappropriate touching and stuff, and how even if it was your parent you should tell someone, or better yet, scream as loud as you can to stop it from happening?” He threw out several ideas, all of them good. “I think we’re on the right track.” I replied as we kept walking and talking. When we got to my place, we walked up and in the front door together, and for a moment we both totally forgot that my parents had not met him yet. “You’re home late.” Mom said a little tightly. “And who is this?” “Oh, um, yeah, sorry mom.” I said with a wry grin. “This is my new best friend, Davey Jones. I thought you should meet him since you’re going to be seeing a lot of him from now on.” “Well, that was quite an introduction.” Mom said with an odd look on her face, but she smiled at Davey and shook his hand. “I think my son might have just fallen in love.” “It might be puppy love.” Davey said dead-pan. “I better watch it in case he decides to start humping my leg.” The look on mom’s face was priceless, and I couldn’t decide if she was going to not like Davey, or fall over laughing. She ended up laughing so hard there were tears in her eyes. “Oh my, your Uncle Rich is going to love hearing this.” Mom said to me as she began to get control over herself. “That’s your uncle in the City, right?” Davey said to me with a wink. “You’re going to have to take me to meet him sometime.” “How about this weekend?” I asked and looked at mom who was looking at us with surprise. “Do you think Uncle Rich might like some visitors?” “I’m sure he’d love to have you guys visit, but um, Brian, are you sure that…” Mom’s voice trailed off as she looked uncomfortably at Davey. “Don’t worry, ma’am, Brian’s already told me about his gay uncle, and no it doesn’t bother me at all.” Davey said with a smile. “My dad’s the hellfire and brimstone preacher, not me. I tend to take a more relaxed view of the world.” “I see.” She said with a twinkle in her eye. “Brian, where did you find this guy?” “On the way to school.” I answered. “Well, would you boys like a snack or something?” Mom asked as she recovered. “No thanks, ma’am.” Davey said with a smile. “I need to get home before Mom gets off work. She probably expects me to have done my chores instead of goofing off with this lug.” “Well, it was nice to meet you.” Mom said with a genuine smile. “I’ll have to meet your parents some day.” “I’m sure you will, ma’am.” Davey said with a twinkle in his eyes and I walked him to the door. She was still watching us, so we couldn’t kiss, but he did mouth ‘I love you’ before turning and walking away. “He’s quite a character.” Mom repeated when I shut the door. “I take it you had a good first day of school?” “You wouldn’t believe how good of a day.” I told her with a smile. The night was odd, I realized as I had nothing to do, really. The few chores I finished before dinner, and something in me wanted to be out, celebrating with my friends, and with Davey, but I knew that could not happen just yet. I spent several hours watching television with my parents, talking with them a little before heading into my room for bed. Twice while I thought about Davey I managed to jerk off, amazed at the sharpness, the almost overpowering level of sensations that rushed through my body. It really was different. “I don’t mind walking, mom.” I told my mother the next day as I waited for Davey. He showed up with his sister in tow. She really was a cute little girl, but she was giving Davey the oddest looks. It wasn’t until we left her at El Vista and headed on to our own school that I found out why. “When I got home last night, I found she’d gotten into my room, taken all my Star Wars action figures and had them in her room playing with her Barbie dolls.” Davey chuckled. “You should have seen her face. She was sitting there, fully prepared for me to launch into a tirade and for us to get in a fight.” “What did you do?” I asked with a smile. Oh yes, younger siblings could do such challenging things all the time. “I told her that when she was done, she’d better put them back where she found them.” Davey laughed. “Then, later, when Mom got home she whined that I was telling her what to do!” “What did your Mom say?” I asked. “She asked what I’d told Jenny to do, and Jenny told her that I was demanding she put away my toys.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “Mom turned to me and before she could say anything, I said ‘The toys she took out of my room and was playing with in her room.’ Mom turned right back around and told Jenny if she didn’t do what I told her, she would be grounded. I swear, if I’d known I’d get that sort of reaction, I’d have done that the first time around.” “It is nice having an older perspective.” I said. “Yeah, but there’s nice things about being younger again, too.” Davey said with a look I knew all too well. His voice dropped an octave. “I thought I was about to leap out of my body when I came last night thinking about you.” “Yeah, me too.” I admitted with a slight blush. “So, when are we going to sneak off somewhere?” He asked me. “Come over to my house after school.” I told him. “Mom’s going to be gone to her sister’s.” “Sounds good to me.” Davey said with a smile. “We can break your bed in again.” “I like that idea.” I said before we met up with our friends at the end of the bike path across from the school. We were fifteen minutes early, but everyone was there. “We need to talk some more about this whole idea.” Trevor said after we’d gotten the greetings out of the way. “I’m not sure if I want to go this route, and Brian, you’re always talking about how our biggest problems stem from us not fully thinking our way through things. We need to be careful about this.” “I agree.” I told him. “Good.” Todd added his agreement and everyone nodded their heads as well. That afternoon, in my house void of any parents, Davey and I managed to get our clothes off and explore our younger bodies. The equipment wasn’t full grown yet, but oh the feelings they generated! Both of us were far too noisy when we climaxed, and we lay there on the bed, together, panting and totally drained afterwards. “That was too good.” Davey said softly. “I’d forgotten what it was like. No wonder people get screwed up having sex too young. It’s just too intense for thought.” “Yep.” I agreed with him before slipping into a light doze. Fortunately Mom’s car in the driveway woke us both, and we got dressed in plenty of time before she made it inside. “Oh, hi Davey!” Mom said with a smile when we came out of the bedroom. “I didn’t know you were here.” “Brian and I were doing some homework.” Davey said with a theatrical sigh. “Those darn teachers! They’ve already got us doing homework!” “I’m sure you’ll survive.” She said with a little laugh. “Were you serious about going to the City this weekend?” He asked both her and me at the same time. “I did talk to Rich today, and he’s free if you boys wanted to visit.” Mom said with a look at me. “That sounds good.” I agreed. “My parents said I could go, but they want to meet you and Mr. B first.” Davey said to her. “Do you think your parents would like to come over for dinner on Thursday?” Mom asked. “As long as we bring my brat of a sister, they’ll probably be delighted.” Davey said and she laughed. “Oh, you have a sister?” She asked and he answered, talking about Jenny for a good five minutes. Poor Mom, Davey had her number already and she didn’t stand a chance against his manipulations. He’d have her eating out of his hand by the end of the week, and it was fun to watch. Oh yes, this was going to be the best timeline ever. Chapter 22 “I don’t know quite what to say, Brian.” Uncle Rich’s voice was weak, and he looked like death warmed over in his hospital bed. An I.V. line pumped liquids into him, but it was only a matter of time, hours, maybe a day or two if he was really lucky. He knew it as well as I did, sitting in this ward of the hospital in San Francisco. Outside it was Christmas, and people were celebrating the holiday with their families. I was too, in my own way, but it was a far different celebration. “I’m sorry, Uncle Rich.” I said softly, still holding his hand. His grip was weak, but he squeezed my hand as tightly as he could. “Don’t be, boy.” He said before a coughing fit took him. He punched the button on the morphine drip, and sighed as more of the drug flowed into his system. I knew he’d be asleep before long, and it would be wrong to keep Mom out of the room for much longer. Her, and her sister, and my father were all here, but I’d begged a few hours alone with him, and gotten them. “If we’d come back earlier, I might have warned you in time.” I said softly. “But we couldn’t quite arrange it perfectly.” “It’s almost too hard to believe, but you sound like you’re serious, so I’m going to believe you.” Rich said weakly, his voice relaxing as the drug eased his pain. “It certainly explains your sudden stroke of genius and them wanting to skip you ahead a few grades.” “It does, doesn’t it?” I said with a small smile. “Thank you, Uncle Rich. The last few months have been wonderful seeing you so much, you know.” “You’ve been a good nephew, and I like your friend, a lot.” Rich said with a chuckle. “Brenda doesn’t quite see it, but I was damn sure you two were a couple before you told me all this time travel stuff. Fated lovers. Got to love that. You be good to each other, you hear me? Stay faithful to each other too, with this damn disease. I wish you could do something about that.” “We’re trying.” I assured him. “We have to be subtle, but we’re pretty sure we found a way to get the right information to the right people without raising too many questions.” “That’s good.” He said before closing his eyes. His breathing was still shallow, but it was pain-free, and he was obviously asleep. I stood up, kissed his forehead and walked out of the room. “He’s asleep.” I said to Mom, who was standing outside with Aunt Linda and Dad. “Did you two say goodbye?” Mom asked and I nodded, letting the tears slide down my face. We really had said goodbye, and I’d had to ask forgiveness for not coming back further in time to save him. At least he’d given me that forgiveness. “Why don’t we go for a walk, son?” Dad said in a gentle voice as the two women went back into the room. I nodded, and we walked out of the hospital into the cool San Francisco morning. It would have been nice if Davey could have been here, but his parents had firmly put their foot down against his visiting over Christmas. There had been a big enough fight when they’d found out that Uncle Rich was sick, and with what. That had nearly shattered the budding friendship between our parents, but we were working on it. “How are you feeling, son?” Dad asked after we’d gone a few blocks. “Better.” I told him. “So much is changing.” Dad said sadly. “Your mother is going to be grieving for a while. You do understand that it isn’t likely…” “He’ll be gone in hours, or maybe a few days at most.” I said sadly. “I’ll miss him.” “I will too.” Dad said. “He’s a good man. It’s a shame he’s dying.” “It is.” I agreed. “How are you feeling about starting your new school?” Dad asked, changing the subject. “Are you sure you want this? You’ll be far away from home. I don’t know how your mother will deal with you being gone to a boarding school.” “I’ll be coming back every couple of months, and all summer.” I reminded him with a smile. He just shook his head. “I know, it’s not the same, but really, I can get a better education there, and I think that’s what I should do. It’s not like I’m going to be alone, either. That’s why we all decided to stop pretending on our school work, because we realized we weren’t alone, and we had friends.” “You do have an amazing group of friends.” Dad agreed. “Still, your mother and I are going to miss having you around.” “Do you think this… argument over Uncle Rich is going to scuttle the plans you’ve been making with Mr. Jones?” I asked him and Dad looked surprised. “No, oddly enough, I don’t think so.” Dad said. “We even talked about that before we drove up here. You were already in bed, but he called wanting to make sure that I wasn’t so pissed off I was going to pull out. It’s a good idea, a good business plan, and we’ve already gotten the loans approved to get started. He may be a little stuffy about social stuff, but he’s a good talker and will make a good face for the business while I handle all the financial issues.” “Plus Mrs. Jones is a pretty good organizer, isn’t she?” I asked, pleased at how Davey and I had pulled off the project of getting our parents into business together. The combination of all four of them working together would help a lot of things, especially with his sister. His father was going to be too busy, and too happy to fall into the emotional state that had led to him molesting his daughter. “She is, she is.” Dad agreed. “The more I get to know them, the more amazed I am by them as a family. Sandy’s father is a blast.” “Dad, stop trying to use cool words.” I told my father and he laughed. By the time we had returned to the hospital, Mom and Aunt Linda were ready for dinner. After a good meal, everyone returned to Uncle Rich’s room, and it was time. I could feel it in the room, and part of me fell apart as his two sisters each held one of Uncle Rich’s hands. He’d been awake, but not really coherent when we came back from dinner. He’d quieted down and smiled though when they held his hands, and so they stood like that for several hours, none of us moving at all until his eyes closed for the last time, and his lungs exhaled for the very last time. While Dad held Mom, I held Aunt Linda who was crying just as hard as my mother. We cleared the room while nurses and a doctor filed in to do all the official things they have to do, and we tried to comfort the two women. My own eyes were filled with tears, and I had to struggle to remember the forgiveness I’d been given for not stopping this. It really was a sad Christmas, but at least there was some more healing to be done after we returned home to Modesto. We’d pulled in and I was still unloading the car when a familiar brown Buick pulled up in front of our house. Mr. Jones was dressed in one of his best suits, and Mrs. Jones was wearing what looked like a new dress as they got out of the car. Even Davey was wearing a suit, and Jenny had on a very pretty dress as well as they walked up the driveway towards me. “Davey told us of your loss, Brian.” David Jones, Sr. said in a quiet, deep voice. “How are you holding up?” “I’m well, sir.” I said quietly, returning his politeness with politeness of my own. “It went as well as one could hope. Uncle Rich was surrounded by his family up until the very end.” “As it should be.” He said with a slight bow of his head. “Do you think your parents would be up for visitors?” “I think they’ll be happy to see you.” I offered and he smiled slightly as Davey took the suitcase I was holding and I led his family up to my house. Mom and Dad were talking quietly in the dining room when we walked in, and at first they looked wary, but that quickly changed to grateful appreciation for their visitors. “You have no idea how much preaching I had to do.” Davey whispered to me as we stood out on the back porch while the adults were still inside, talking over coffee (and tea for Sandy). Jenny was in the living room watching television. “I took his own damn bible and started pulling out every bible verse I could find about love and forgiveness. Considering we were at Nanny’s, and all the family was there, it turned into a free-for-all bible study session. When Papa came in on my side, I knew I’d won. “I knew you could do it.” I congratulated him softly and he blushed slightly. Making sure our parents stayed on good terms was important to both of us for a variety of reasons. My last time around, I’d taken the approach that I had plenty of years to make changes, but Sean had disabused me of that notion with our failure to stop the mad scientist and the power-hungry communist. Instead of just enjoying our collective new teenage years, we were going to take steps. Besides, as Trevor remarked, it got kind of old after a month. Even I’d forgotten the big differences between being twelve and being seventeen. We all had bed times that were far too early, our parents watched us a lot, a lot more than we were used to having to deal with, and of course none of us could legally drive. What had been a short car drive over to someone’s house turned into twenty or thirty minutes of bike riding, jogging, or begging for a ride from a parent. Sure, the school we were going to had a lot more restrictions in some ways, but in other ways it also had a lot more freedoms for us, and it would accelerate us on the path of making some changes. It was shortly after the New Year, 1982, when we all flew up to our new school with our parents. The school was a very private, very exclusive Military Preparatory Academy in the backwoods of upstate New York. I know most kids get threatened with being sent off to a military school if they are bad, but in this case there couldn’t have been a better fit for all of us. I had heard of the school in my original timeline because I’d worked with one person who had gone there. The man was a career diplomat in the State Department and one of the best at what he did. He had given full credit to the General John Cleveland Robinson Academy for giving him many of the skills he used in his work. As a private school, it accepted only students that it had invited to attend, and I was surprised when we received invitations in late November. Almost never did any school of this type offer mid-term admissions, and for all six of us to receive invitations was an opportunity I hoped we, as a group, would not pass up. After looking at their academic offerings, most of us were onboard with going there (especially since there were scholarships involved so that all of us could afford to attend), but the deciding factor for Trevor was the fact that they did have a football team. The school was your typical private boarding school, located on fairly large grounds that were well maintained, circled by a wall, and had uniformed guards at the front gate. There were four main large, multi-story buildings, and several smaller buildings as well as what looked like a fairly impressive sports complex all visible through the trees as we drove up the main drive. At the main building, an older man dressed in the uniform of an Army Colonel met us, and pleasantly greeted our parents before greeting the six of us who would be attending the school. “I am Colonel Barry Reynolds, the Deputy Superintendent of the Academy, and Professor of Military History.” He said by way of his own introduction. For the next hour, he personally led us on a tour of the facility, mostly directed at our parents. Then after introducing another man who was also an instructor there, we were separated from our parents and the real introductions began. “Each of you should be honored that we are accepting you as students here.” He told us in a stern voice. “You will be the youngest students in our school at this time, and you will have a lot of catching up to do from the beginning. That is why you are here a week before the term begins. We will cut you no slack once the term begins. For the next week you will be drilled in all the things you would have learned since last August regarding how this school operates. Four upper classmen have graciously volunteered to cut their leave period short in order to help prepare you for the new term. You will show them your appreciation by following all their directions to the utmost of your abilities.” He went on like that for several minutes, with all the typical things one might expect about the history and honor of the school. Then he introduced us to the upper classmen, who seemed a little taken aback that three of us were as tall as they were, even though we were five years younger. After a short period of their attempting to establish their dominance with typical bluster, our parents were returned for a lunch served in the dining hall of the school. That was where we were introduced to General Robert Lingstrom, the Superintendent of the school. He was a retired three-star Army General, who listed as part of his resume having worked for ten years at the National Security Agency. That was what had made us go from merely liking the idea of this school to doing my best to make sure everyone signed on with going here. After lunch, our parents gave us all a teary-eyed farewell; at least they were teary eyed while we all sighed with relief to see the rental cars leave. Then the upper classmen descended on us and gave us their version of a military boot camp. I wasn’t sure which disturbed them more, the ease with which all of us handled the push-ups and sit-ups they kept on requiring, the fact that all of us had already perfectly memorized the “General Orders” that all cadets were expected to know, or the fact that later that night none of us were homesick or crying, wanting to go back home. Todd and Sean were the two of us least accepting of the military mindset. I had been in the military myself, albeit as a reserve JAG officer, and Davey took to it like a fish to water. Trevor and Brandon accepted it with mild enjoyment, and although they didn’t really like all of it, Sean and Todd both tolerated it overall. The only thing they really complained about was the haircuts. They did not like having their hair shorn off, but even that they tolerated although I heard quite a few grumbles from them. The only real mistake the school had made was in the room assignments. All cadets lived in a two-person room. Each cadet had his own bunk, locker, wardrobe, and desk. Normally the school assigned cadets to the room, but during the first semester several cadets had ‘dropped out’ of the school, and the cadets left without a roommate had been moved, so there were more than three rooms available. No one had made room assignments for us, and that first day we were led to three available rooms, ordered to select our rooms and stow away our gear. That was a BIG mistake, but one we were extremely happy about because we were three couples and had been worried about how to get the right people to be rooming together. Since they had warned us that whoever we roomed with would be our roommates all through the rest of school, unless one of us dropped out, we were all extremely happy to make sure we roomed with our partner. At least now we would not have to be sneaking between rooms every night. “I don’t know if I can do this, Brian.” Davey moaned halfway through the first week. We were re-folding all of our clothes, mostly uniforms the school had provided. Like the real military, they expected everything folded in a very precise manner, just like our ‘bunks’ had to be made with tight corners precisely at a forty-five degree angle. “Do what?” I asked him. “Make my bed every damn morning, and fold my clothes like this.” Davey sighed. “What about all the other stuff?” I asked him and he laughed. “That shit is easy.” Davey said while laughing. “This is the hard shit.” For a week, the upper classmen tried to run us through what they thought would be hell. They got us up at three in the morning, and kept us going until late at night. There was a lot of physical exercise, but also a lot of mental drills as well. Marching was a big part of every day since it was a big part of the school’s daily routine, and we were drilled constantly on things like every little fact about the school’s namesake, Civil War Union General John Cleveland Robinson. Sunday was a little different for four of us since we were not used to dealing with ‘chapel’ or church services, but it was a requirement that all cadets attend. Davey and Sean snickered at the rest of us over that little aspect. Soon enough the term started, and the real schoolwork began. It took a few weeks for our fellow first-year cadets to warm up to us. At first they were standoffish with us new guys, but the first inter-house game competition in February broke the ice. We beat the sophomore team at nearly every event, and a large part of that was thanks to the athleticism of Trevor, Brandon, Davey and myself. The actual schoolwork was a mixture of easy and difficult subjects. We had no problems in the regular History, English, Math, or various Foreign Language subjects, but the Military History and other military-centered classes proved challenging. By the time Spring Break rolled around, everyone had expressed that they were generally happier at the school than they had been back home in Modesto. Still, it was good for all of us to go home over Spring Break and spend time with our families. For a week, we barely saw each other as we spent time with our individual families, but near the end of the week, it was our families who brought all of us together for a barbecue at a local park. There were about fifty of us altogether, as various grandparents, including my own grandparents who were still alive in this time line, all gathered along with our immediate families. When we returned from a very relaxing, and fun, Spring Break, each of us was called into the Superintendent’s office for one-on-one meetings. Overall, the General was pleased with how we were fitting into the school, but apparently some of the instructors were concerned that portions of our school work were ‘too easy’ for us. He did not like the idea that we were not being ‘challenged’ to develop to our full potential, and wanted to have us be given in-depth assessments by his faculty. That suited all of us just fine, because while some of our courses were challenging, we all knew that most of it was far too easy, and none of us liked the idea of not learning as much as we could. I think part of that was because of the last few years of the last timeline, where we’d raced against the clock to end a situation that threatened the stability of the world in which we lived. We all felt some personal level of responsibility to keep something like that from happening again, and mentally at least, we were all adults. Sure, we still had fun like any other teenagers, and a great deal of sex in the privacy of our own rooms, but we had a purpose, a mission, and we wanted to succeed in that mission. Summer was a fun time for all of us. We were thirteen, and had finished what was effectively our ‘freshman’ year of high school two years early. During that summer we spent a lot of time camping, hiking, fishing (including several trips with Davey’s grandfather), and all the typical summer activities of teenagers. Occasionally we’d have arguments, and fight, but we’d get over it when our tempers calmed down and usually end up laughing over what we fought about. The ‘business’ being started by my family and Davey’s was actually doing quite well. Parts of the idea had come from Davey’s father’s business in the last timeline. David Jones Sr. was proving to be quite a good salesman as he took the idea to companies like Microsoft, which was just starting to rise as a major player, and established giants like IBM. According to their business model it would still be another year before things actually got off the ground, but already they were doing quite well even though they had not yet delivered any finished product. We all ended up going back to the Academy several weeks early for the start of the football training program. The Academy took football quite seriously, and there was quite a bit of grumbling when Trevor ended up on Varsity as second-string quarterback even though he was so young. Davey and I were good, but not quite good enough for the main squad, so we were on the J.V. team along with Brandon. Sean and Todd didn’t arrive until just before school started along with everyone else since they had no interest in playing on the team. Sean’s relationship with his parents was actually better off now than it had been in any other timeline. The distance from them and their not looking over his shoulder all the time was helpful and he actually expressed a grudging change in his desire to see his father meet a grisly fate. Sometimes, distance does make the heart grow fonder. Our term as “Second-Class Cadets” went a lot smoother than our first half-year. We were now accepted by our year-mates as part of their class, and although we only took about half our classes with them, we were no longer strangers. The academic work was much more challenging, largely because our ‘core’ classes were taught in special classes with just the six of us, or sometimes some smaller mix (we all had varying levels of skills in mathematics, so Davey and I ended up in classes with Fourth-Year cadets while the rest were in their own special classes). Trevor enjoyed the football season, even if he only got to play in three games, and only for a total of three quarters. Not everything was perfect. Halfway through the year, Sean ended up before a disciplinary review board for fighting with a Third-Year cadet. The cadet in question was a bully, and had been physically harassing the smaller Sean when Sean unleashed his full fury on the older student. The bully hadn’t stood a chance and ended up in the infirmary with a broken nose while Sean suffered a few bruises. The end result of the disciplinary hearing was that both of them were punished for fighting, but the upper classman received the harsher punishment and a warning that further incidents would result in his removal from school. A much more serious situation arose in the middle of the baseball season. Todd played with us on the team, as did Davey, Brandon, and Trevor. After practice one day, Todd and Trevor disappeared into a little-used shed near the baseball fields and were in the middle of oral sex when a Fourth-Year cadet walked in, finding them. He threatened them with revealing what he’d seen to the faculty if they didn’t ‘service’ him on demand, but was interrupted by the sounds of Davey and I calling out for our friends. Hastily he told them to meet him back there the next day or he’d tell. Naturally Todd and Trevor told us what had happened, and we concocted a plan to deal with the upper classman. I ended up talking with an upper classman on the team after practice, one who we all suspected was gay from the way he took slightly longer looks at everyone in the shower, and we just happened to be walking by the shed as Trevor and Todd were pretty much pushed into the shed by Jason Howell, the cadet who was trying to blackmail them. “Oh no.” Bill Lindstrom, the Fourth-Year I was talking with growled. “What?” I asked. “Wasn’t that two of your friends with Howell?” He asked me. “Yeah.” I agreed, trying to hide my smile. “I can guarantee he’s up to no good.” Lindstrom stated and walked purposefully over to the shed, where we could hear an argument going on inside. “No, we won’t do it!” Trevor’s elevated voice was clearly audible. “I don’t care what you say to people, it’s your word against ours.” “You’ll damn well suck me off, you stupid cocksuckers!” Howell growled at them and Lindstrom got an angry look on his face as he threw the door open and stormed inside. Howell was standing there, his practice pants unbuttoned and half-hard cock flopped out while he stood facing Trevor and Todd. He turned around with a sneer on his face but blanched when he saw Lindstrom. “It’s not what it looks like! I caught these two…” “Stow it, Howell.” Lindstrom growled. “I covered for your ass when I caught you and that First-Year two years ago. Put that fucking thing back in your pants and I better never, ever hear of you harassing anyone again.” Howell stormed out, and I was amazed at our good fortune until Lindstrom turned back to my two friends who were smiling and he managed to give all three of us a glare. “Thank you.” Todd said quickly but was cut off by Lindstrom shaking his head. “Look, let me explain something to the lot of you, and you better sure as hell share it with your friends.” Lindstrom growled. “I know you six think you’re the hottest shit on this campus, but we’re not blind. It’s obvious as hell what you guys do with each other, but as long as you fucking keep it hidden, no one’s going to say anything. Guys like Howell, they’re just looking for a chance to fuck you guys over. You need to be more fucking careful where you do your shit, get it?” “Uh, yeah.” Trevor said with a slightly scared look on his face. “Um, thanks.” “Don’t fucking thank me.” Lindstrom growled. “Someone should have told you guys already. Just fucking tone it down and keep your shit private.” With that he turned and walked out. Later that night, we all had several long discussions and decided to try and tone things down a bit. We had been getting carried away, doing things in places where we could, and in this case, had been caught. After that, we kept it to our rooms, long after lights out for the most part, or managed to use each other as lookouts while the others had some fun. Christmas break of 1982 was fun, and 1983 rolled around without any big surprises for anyone. Davey was growing increasingly worried as the time frame got closer for when his father had started molesting his sister, but he’d done just about everything possible to forestall that from ever happening. He and his sister were a lot closer than they’d ever been before, and they actually corresponded by letter a lot during the school year. By the time summer rolled around, we were all ready for an extended break from the Academy, but Davey and I were a little unprepared for the changes the summer brought. First off, his family was moving in to a home just three doors down from my parents. Then, both of our fathers were gone most of the summer as their business began to take off, and they landed several major contracts with rental firms across the nation. They did take two weeks off towards the tale end of summer, and we were surprised by the trip to Europe. That was when we learned just how well the business was doing. Our families were on the verge of becoming millionaires, and were considering ‘going public’. This time around, there wasn’t likely going to be a need for us to win the lottery. Our families were going to handle that for us just fine. Our third year at the Academy went exceedingly well. In fact, it went way beyond our expectations. Academically, we were very challenged, and for the first time since coming back to this timeline, we all felt like we were being pushed to the full extent of our abilities. Our days were busy, and our nights were spent doing more studying than anything else. During the Spring semester of 1984, there was an elective course that we were allowed to take. The instructor was a retired analyst from the Soviet desk of the CIA. His course was “A History of the USSR and the Future of Communism.” One of the last assignments he gave us towards the end of the course was to write an essay, using full citation of at least eight sources, on what the future held for the Soviet Union. All six of us managed to independently write six essays on the fall of the Soviet Union. None of us collaborated, and although we used some of the same sources for citation, when we reviewed each other’s finished papers, they were different enough that it was obvious we’d each made our own efforts. While all of our conclusions were the same, each of us had reached them in slightly different ways that showed our different way of thinking. Two weeks before the end of the semester, and two weeks after we’d turned in the essays, we were all called into the Superintendent’s office. “Mr. Alstrom was very impressed with the papers each of you wrote.” The retired General said when we were all standing before him. “At first he suspected you’d helped each other with the papers, but after reviewing them he realized you had probably all discussed this topic with each other without having collaborated on what was to be an individual project. Is that correct?” “Yes, sir!” We all answered in unison. “That’s good, I’d hate to think of any of my cadets cheating.” He growled with a warning look at all of us. “Now, Mr. Alstrom was so impressed with your work, that he’s called a few of his friends. I know each of you are much younger than our normal Third-Year cadets, but that shouldn’t hamper your opportunities. When you graduate here after your fourth-year, you will be more than ready for whatever University you choose to attend. Mr. Alstrom has been good enough to cut through the red tape and get an offer extended for each of you to intern with his former employer over the summer. It won’t take up your entire summer, but will be for all but a few weeks. None of you are obligated to accept, but I would consider it a personal favor if as many of you as possible will accept. Young men your age rarely have an opportunity such as this. I won’t lie. Most of what you will be doing will be grunt work, delivering files, making coffee and the like, but you will still learn many things, even if none of you choose it as a career.” “I’ll accept, sir.” Davey said without hesitating. “My parents may not like it all that much, but Dad’s going to be pretty busy except for a few weeks towards the end of summer where he wants to go for another trip. As long as we don’t have to change that, things should work out.” “I’ll contact your parents to make the arrangements.” The General said with a nod and then he looked at me with a raised eyebrow. “Cadet Breckenridge, does this mean you will be going?” “Yes, sir, it does.” I said, and knew from the small smile and nod on his face that he damn well knew Davey and I were a couple, but said nothing. Maybe he thought it was ‘just a phase’, or didn’t even think about it at all, but he did know where one of us went, the other was not far behind. “Count us in too, sir.” Trevor said after sharing a few looks with Todd, whose eyes were bright at the idea of actually getting into the CIA building. “Good choice, gentlemen.” The General said with another short nod. “We might as well go too.” Sean said with a slight sigh. “Excellent.” The General said with a wider grin. “I’ll let Mr. Alstrom know all six of you have accepted. You can expect to receive further details over the next week. Dismissed.” The ‘further details’ amounted to a lot of documents about secrecy that we had to sign, and since we were minors, had to be signed by our parents. Most of what we did that summer really was grunt work. We delivered files, we made coffee, and similar things, but we also talked to several people whose job it was to analyze every bit of data collected about the Soviet Union. Most of them thought we were foolishly naïve children, but we laid some important seeds over the summer. That summer, Davey and I went with our families to West Germany, France, and Italy. It was odd, having traveled to a lot of these countries in other timelines, mostly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the European Union. The checkpoints at different borders that no longer existed after the mid-1990’s were a unique experience, especially after having spent most of the summer at the CIA. Our last year at the Academy was the toughest yet, with our instructors having spent most of the last few years learning our strengths and weaknesses. The school wasn’t really a big one, so they got to know all of their students fairly well, and they used that information mercilessly to challenge us in a variety of ways. In sports, Trevor was the starting quarterback, and even managed to attract the attention of a few college scouts, our faculty members had tipped off the scouts to this amazingly talented fifteen-year old who would be eligible for college next year. Nearly every week, we got at least two or three brochures for several top-notch universities and we began to discuss among ourselves what we would do for the future. That was why in late November of that year, after spending Thanksgiving at home with our families, we all met over at Trevor’s house the day before we were to fly back to school. His parents were both out, visiting some friends, and so we met in their dining room. We had all brought the tons of brochures and letters we’d received from various universities, colleges, and from various other institutions offering scholarships. “First off, I think we need to make a final decision on what to do about our dear friend, the mad scientist.” Sean said with a sarcastic drawl after we were all settled in at the table. “We can plant evidence that points to him working with the Soviets.” I offered. In the last timeline they had been hesitant to kill people, and even though they’d been on board for removal after coming back, offering this way out might be a better option for them. “He can’t invent time travel if he’s in jail for the rest of his life.” “Not good enough.” Sean disagreed with a shake of his head. “He can still do the mathematics, and we all know that with enough money anything is possible. Guys, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. None of you know the man the way I do. He’s obsessed with this, and nothing short of death will stop him. The only way I can see that we guarantee he and Shevardnadze do not meet up would be to make sure he is dead.” “Or Shevardnadze.” Davey added grimly as he nodded his head in agreement. “Of course, we won’t be able to get near Shevardnadze.” “No, which is why the man who first invented time travel is the one who has to die.” Sean said, taking back the discussion. “I think I know just how to do it too. A story in the news last year gave me a good idea. One of the things that bugged me about the guy is that he smokes like a chimney. There were a few times I had to go over to his house first thing in the morning. He’s had the same house since the 1960’s, this little two-bedroom thing built during the depression. The place stank like you wouldn’t believe, and the first thing he did when he got up every morning was to light up a cigarette even before he was out of bed.” “So?” Trevor asked with a confused look. “We know he doesn’t die of cancer.” “No, but he does have a gas stove.” Sean said grimly. “If we got in there, turned off the pilot light at night, made sure all the windows were closed, and left a burner on, he’d blow up when he had his morning smoke.” Davey said with a little grin on his face. “That’s a lot of if’s, there Sean.” “He has bad allergies some times.” Sean said with a shrug. “Part of the reason why the place stank so bad was that he never opens the windows to air it out. It’ll work. I know it.” “If it doesn’t, we can work on a fallback plan.” I offered. Everyone looked uncomfortable, but no one objected. “Now, which of us will do it, and when? We should make sure whoever goes has a good alibi just in case.” “What about his neighbors?” Todd asked with a frown. “Won’t we be risking hurting them too if his house just blows up?” “His nearest neighbor is several hundred yards away.” Sean said with a shrug. “They’ll be fine. And I’ll do it. I know the house. I’ve been in there in the other timeline.” “Won’t he hear you breaking in?” Trevor asked. “I’ve been thinking about this.” Sean said with a grin. “In the nineties, he always kept a spare key under the back door. I bet it’s there in this timeline too. He likes to make his assistants go get things that he might have left at home so he just leaves a spare key where they can find it easily. I’ll wait until he goes to bed, maybe an hour after that, and then I’ll go in, blow out the pilot light and leave the burner on. He’s always making tea in a kettle, so I’ll put the kettle over the burner, make it look like he’d left it on and didn’t realize it or something. That should be enough to throw any possible suspicion off it being foul play.” “What if you’re seen?” Brandon asked. “I don’t want you going to jail.” “I can do it without being seen.” Sean said confidently. “Besides, you guys will be my alibi, right?” “Yeah.” Davey said thoughtfully. “How about we do this over Spring Break? We’ve got that camping trip planned. All of us are planning to go to the DMV together and get our licenses right? And then we’ve already told our families we’re going camping for three days. That’ll give Sean one day to watch the place, and then another to actually do it.” “I’m going with him.” Brandon said fiercely and no one objected. “We’ll be able to give you both good alibis, especially if we go up on a back trail for most of the day.” Trevor added. “Okay, sounds like that’s settled. What’s next?” “College.” I said and everyone looked around nervously for a moment. “Look, I have to wonder if we’ve all been thinking along similar lines.” Trevor said after the silence had almost become uncomfortable. “Don’t get me wrong, I love all you guys. The thing is, we’ve been together, living together, working together, in each other’s pockets for damn near ten years now over two timelines. I’d like to be out on my own for a while, at least the four years it’ll take to finish up an undergraduate degree.” “What about me?” Todd asked with a mock pout and Trevor smiled while Brandon and Sean chuckled. “You know I don’t mean you in that.” Trevor said softly. “I’d just like it to be you and me for a bit, you know. Focus on us more, instead of the group.” “I’d like that too.” Todd agreed. “So would I.” Davey added as he looked at me. “No offense guys.” “It sounds like we’ve been thinking along the same lines.” Brandon chuckled. “So, what school have you picked, Trevor?” “USC.” Trevor said. “They offered me a football scholarship, and they’ve got that film program Todd’s been interested in since the last timeline. Brian, you always said you could work that into your plans.” “I can.” I agreed. “Good.” Todd said with a determined look. “What about you guys, Brandon and Sean?” “MIT, full-ride scholarships for both of us.” Sean said proudly as he held up two letters that he and Brandon had brought. “I’ve got engineering. It’ll be a nice change from Physics now that I don’t have to babysit that bastard again.” “Computer science for me.” Brandon added with a slight shrug. “This time I can get a proper education in the subject.” “Sorry about that.” I said quietly and he chuckled. “Wasn’t your fault, Bri.” Brandon stated. “They just didn’t have a halfway decent program.” “What about you two?” Sean asked with a slightly worried look. “You said you went to Stanford in your first timeline. You going to go there again?” “No.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “He went there so that I could pitch on the baseball team.” “Now there’s a joke.” Trevor chuckled as everyone else laughed. “Davey Jones pitching!” “Shut up.” Davey said defensively. Sure, he could throw a ball halfway decently after years and years of practice with us, but he was nowhere near being pitcher-quality in an amateur league, much less college ball. “We’re going to Whitman College.” I said to cut off the teasing Davey was getting. Everyone looked confused. “I’ve never heard of it.” Brandon stated. “It’s a CIA school.” Davey said. “Well, it’s a school with a program specific for the CIA.” “I thought you were staying away from the CIA after our little internship?” Brandon said to me with a confused look. “He’s doing it because I want to do it.” Davey said. “I like it. I want to do it.” “Which is why we’re going there.” I stated firmly. “But what about the long-range plans?” Trevor asked with a confused expression. “We abandoning them?” “No.” Davey said with a sigh. “I’ll have a couple years in by the mid-nineties, and Brian and I can go back to school, get our Masters degrees and then go over to State. It’s not like the mafia, really.” “If you think you can pull that off.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “Well, I guess that was pretty easy to do.” “Yeah, but don’t worry, we won’t lose touch with each other.” I assured them. “We’ve been through too much for that.” “No fucking shit.” Davey snorted, and we all laughed together before Trevor’s parents got home. Chapter 23 When we graduated from the Robinson Academy, we were part of a graduating class of sixty-three. All sixty-three graduates of the Academy went on to college, something not quite unusual for that school, but unusual in most public schools. Fourteen of those graduates went on to one of the four military Academies. Five (including Sean and Brandon) went to MIT. Most went to Ivy League schools like Yale or Harvard. Davey and I were the only two going to a little school in the heavily wooded area of Washington State where Whitman was located. Or rather, where we had planned to attend when we graduated. “This is weird.” Davey said as we unpacked our bags in the dorm room, two weeks before school started. “Yes, it is.” I agreed with him. We were both halfway through our sixteenth year, and freshmen about to begin our first year in college. “Did you see the house?” Davey asked me and I nodded. The dorm room was one of those on the top floor of the building, providing a spectacular view of the surrounding area. Well, it would be spectacular if you were the least bit interested. At least the dorm room we had been assigned was just the two of us instead of one of the bigger rooms. We had gotten here about an hour ago, and after doing our check-in were almost unpacked. “I did.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out as a sigh. I had not realized until I’d seen it how much I’d loved that house. “This is going to suck.” Davey said as he finished connecting the last connection on his computer and he sat down to boot it up. He had gotten his buzz cut freshened up back in Modesto before we’d left for college. We were supposed to let our hair grow out a bit more, but he’d complained about it itching too much and decided to see if he could get away with one more haircut before the fall semester started. “You want me to remind you it’s your fault?” I said in a tight voice and he actually laughed sharply before shaking his head. “Would it help if I said I was sorry?” He said as he turned around in his chair and gave me a pouting look. “Oh stop that.” I said with irritation and he smiled, knowing I’d already forgiven him. Damn it, what were they thinking? We were only sixteen! “Don’t worry, it’s not like we’re really sixteen.” He said after seeing the expression on my face. I gave another sigh, and nodded my head in agreement. Instead of arguing further I went over and hugged him, giving him a kiss on the top of the head. “I’m going to go for a walk.” I said gently and he nodded as his computer finished booting up and he turned back around. He’d already hooked up the phone line to the 4,800 baud modem and would be making sure everything worked just fine. Shutting the door behind me I went out and took the elevator down to the first floor. With a nod for the sleepy student at the front desk I left the building, barely wincing as the heat hit me like a wall. I’d survived Arizona before, and while I wasn’t happy to be back here instead of nice, cool Washington, it wasn’t going to kill me. We were here early, and except for some athletes, most of the campus was still fairly empty as I walked around the familiar environs of Arizona State. To be honest, I was feeling a little lonely without Trevor, Brandon, Sean, and Todd around. We had made other friends at Robinson, but the six of us had been a fairly insular group for all those years. Now it was just Davey and me here at this school. Both Sean and Brandon had been remote ever since Spring Break, when the two of them had left our campsite for the mission in Livermore. They’d returned very quiet, and had barely spoken a word the rest of the weekend except to say that they were successful. We’d all been quiet for the rest of the week with the realization that we’d all contributed to the killing of another human being, who had not yet done anything. Trevor had confirmed it for us, by speaking with his father when we returned. Trevor had brought up a story in talking with his father about how a student at the Academy had been caught smoking in his room. His father had shaken his head, and commented that smoking was stupid and dangerous. One of his co-workers at the lab had died just a few days before when his pilot light had gone out during the night, and the man had woken up and lit a cigarette. That was all the confirmation we’d needed, and towards the end of summer we’d all breathed a sigh of relief when we’d not heard anything more or any whisper that the death had raised suspicions. After making a circuit of the central part of the campus, I made my way up, past the dormitories and by the stadium. Memories of Trevor playing football there came to the forefront of my mind, and I shook my head while a half-smile flitted onto my face. As much as I wanted to be mad at Davey for getting us into this… situation, I could not really blame him. The Davey Jones I had first met in my original timeline had over a century of experiences behind him, and he’d done just about everything he’d ever dreamed of doing, except maybe making it into space. When I came back in time, I’d known that there would be a lot of challenges, and one of those would be that the Davey Jones I was meeting would not have had those experiences. Davey had told me, in the original timeline, that he’d craved adventure and excitement when he was younger. That had led him into many interesting experiences. In my first trip back in time, Davey had been patient, but after Sean had come back he’d gotten a taste of being involved with ‘the big picture’ in a direct way, and I knew that deep down part of him craved something similar in this timeline. That was why I’d pushed him and my friends to the Robinson Academy. I’d hoped it’s ‘military’ elements would keep him satisfied, but they’d just fed his hunger for something more, and so now here we were, involved with America’s spy agency. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I hoped it wouldn’t have too many effects on the long-range plans for the future. It shouldn’t, but as I’d already learned, the future wasn’t written and even the most prepared or experienced time traveler could run into the unexpected. “You’re back!” Davey said when I came back to our dorm room. He got out of the chair in front of the computer and crossed over to hug me as soon as I’d closed the door behind me. “You smell good.” I said as I caught the scent of the cologne he was wearing. “You’re sweaty, and you smell good too.” Davey said in a familiar, husky tone. Even as I leaned forward a bit more to kiss him comfortably, I could feel him hardening in his jeans. By the time we were done, we were both sweaty, and feeling very good as we laid together on one of the narrow dorm beds. It was a good thing we had four years of practice sleeping together in small beds at the Academy. “I like it when you greet me like that.” I said as I ran a finger along his side. He shivered slightly at the touch. “So you forgive me for getting you into this?” He asked in a very soft tone. “Yes.” I said without hesitation. “Sorry, you know how I get when plans get changed.” “You and your plans.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. It was probably his biggest frustration with me. I didn’t react well when my plans were de-railed or sidetracked. “I’ll get over it like I always do.” I said as I reached around discovered to my joy that he was ready for another round. He sighed as my hand began to stroke him gently. “I love it when you do that.” He said quietly, and it was another hour before we were walking down the hallway to the showers. Two football players were in there, and greeted us with nods before heading out. That night we ate at a restaurant on Mill Avenue before heading to the theater where we watched a movie both of us had already seen in another timeline. Then we headed back to the dorm room. We could have easily afforded the house, or other off-campus living quarters, but our ‘handler’ at the CIA wanted us to live on-campus. Thus we were going to get the ‘full’ experience on campus this year. We were even being encouraged to pledge a frat if the opportunity arose. Davey seemed to like the idea, and if he wanted it, I’d go along with him. “Brian, I’m excited.” Davey said later that night as we lay together in one of the two beds. “Excited?” I asked. “Yeah, excited.” Davey said with a sigh. “Sorry, it’s just, you know, I’ve got this feeling like anything can happen. I know you put a lot of time and effort into your plans, and they’re good plans, but I feel like right now anything can happen and that excites me. Part of me feels like we’re going to be getting to go to school for real now, unlike last time. With all the others around, last time felt like just an extension of high school, but now it’s just us and that’s exciting.” “I understand.” I told him gently and he snuggled up tighter against me. His breathing became regular as he drifted off to sleep, and I was falling asleep soon after. The next morning we had our interview with Professor Lee. He looked no different than he had in the last timeline, and we spent a good hour sitting in his office talking in nothing but Russian. That had been one of our courses for the last four years, giving us both a good reason for being proficient in the language. After we were done, he had signed off on putting us in the advanced-level language courses. With that mission accomplished, we headed back downtown to the coffee shop that we’d enjoyed with our friends in the last timeline. Then, our families showed up in the late afternoon, and we went out with all of them. Jenny was fourteen now, getting ready to start high school. Her parents had offered to send her to a boarding school, but she insisted on going to Downey. Last year, the company our parents started had gone public, and at least on paper they were now millionaires with their stock options. By and large, they hadn’t changed how they lived much, and even Davey’s mother was trying to live her life as if not much had changed, but they did enjoy a few things, like staying at the more expensive Biltmore Resort while in Phoenix, and going out to dinner at the more expensive restaurants in town. They stayed for three days before heading back, and Davey and I got down to business preparing for the upcoming semester. The truth is, I love school. I enjoy learning, even if it’s learning something over again. Each time is a little different, and the classes I had that first semester were all slightly different than those I’d had in the last timeline, and of course different than those I’d had at Stanford. Another thing I had discovered is that while some schools have a deserved reputation for excellence in education, the quality of any education, at any school depended on two primary factors: The desire, or motivation, of the teacher to actually teach and the desire of the student to learn. The finest teacher, with the finest materials, the best-prepared curricula and lessons plans, and the absolute finest in teaching aides is wasted if a student has no desire to learn. Likewise, the best-prepared, highly motivated, eager student is wasting his time if the teacher in front of him has no desire to really teach. Good textbooks, lab equipment, support staff, office hours, money for extra materials and other supporting mechanisms are important, but given two bare essentials: a good teacher and a good student, it is possible to achieve the best in education with little else. That was one of Arizona State’s greatest resources: their professors. For the most part, their professors were eager to teach, and knew their subjects very well. While at many other institutions of higher learning, research was the main goal of professors, here there was still a strong ethos of instructing amongst the professors. By carefully selecting certain professors, both Davey and I managed to construct a course schedule for the first year that kept us interested in our courses. We also developed friendships with several other students. By its very nature, the university’s foreign language programs tended to produce tight-knit groups of students. Studying a language effectively took more than going to class and doing the assigned homework. Watching movies in that language, reading literature in that language, and actually holding conversation in the language was necessary to move from a basic proficiency into actual competence. Many of the students we joined that year had been studying the language together for three years already, and while at first we were interlopers, they quickly grew to accept us as part of their group. Of those students, they were all in their early to mid-twenties, and so there was a slight age gap between us at first, especially when they would go out drinking on the weekends, but as the semester stretched on, it became less of a barrier. Davey and I went home to Modesto for Thanksgiving, and our families seemed to enjoy the tales we had to tell of life at ASU. Davey’s father practically beamed with pride at having his son go to that school. The man was not the same as the David Jones Sr. who had become President, but he was closer to that man than the one in the previous timeline. Davey was understandably proud of him. It was Davey’s mother who cast a little cloud over the holiday with a single comment. “Now that you boys are at a school with girls, have either of you started dating yet?” His mother asked us with a piercing look. My parents looked a little uncomfortable, having figured us out long ago, but his parents were still largely in the dark about the true nature of our relationship. “Mom!” Davey exclaimed with a slight blush. “The youngest girls at ASU are all eighteen or older! I’m jailbait to them!” “Oh.” His mother said with a worried frown. “What about girls from one of the high schools?” “I go to college.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “What mother is going to want her daughter dating a college student?” “That might be a problem.” His mother said with a shake of her head. “Don’t worry, son.” Davey’s father said with a smile. “In just over a year you’ll be eighteen. Plenty of time for that.” “Thanks dad.” Davey said with a shake of his head. His hair, like mine was growing out a bit, and we both needed at least a trim to keep our hair looking neat. We managed to hook up with our friends the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and we all spent most of the day up at Don Pedro Reservoir, sitting in a rented boat in the middle of the lake and talking about the last few months. None of us were extensive letter-writers, and e-mail was still a few years away as a means for us to communicate. Davey and I had a phone in our dorm room, but we were the only couple that had that luxury. So, we spent the day catching up with our friends. “We miss you guys.” Todd said about halfway through the day. “But, well, it’s like we’re learning how to make other friends at school. It’s kind of weird, like maybe that when we were all together we didn’t really need other people so we shut them out. Don’t take it the wrong way, but it’s nice making new friends again.” “It is.” Davey agreed. “Just don’t think we’re going to forget you guys, though.” “No, we’ll always be the best of friends.” Sean agreed while everyone nodded. When we returned to Arizona, almost everyone was focused on the upcoming finals. They were weeks away, and there were still parties every weekend that we both managed to attend. We had gotten invitations to pledge several frats on campus, but Davey had decided (wisely in my opinion) that he didn’t really want to be a ‘frat’. Both of us were certain we’d done well on our finals, and we left Arizona for the extended winter break. Unlike the last timeline, we weren’t taking Winter Session courses, and so we stayed in Modesto from late December all the way until the weekend before Spring Semester started. Our parents now had a big office in downtown Modesto, and we began to realize just how big their business was growing. Dad had mentioned they’d taken the company public a few months ago, but our Christmas presents included stock in their company. When we realized the stock we had been given was valued at nearly a million dollars for each of us, I was floored. This was far better than providing a winning lottery ticket had been. The one troubling point was Davey’s mother and grandmothers both throwing girls at him the entire time we were back in Modesto. He even went on two ‘dates’, and I’d commiserated with him over the awful time he’d had on the dates. Davey wanted to wait until he was eighteen though, before telling them the truth about our relationship. It would make dealing with any fallout from them easier. When school started up, it was proving to be a hectic semester. The other students in our Russian courses were by and large preparing to go to the Soviet Union for the summer. The university’s Russian language program had managed to once again obtain approval from both governments for a summer-length study program at Moscow State University. Many of the students from our classes would be spending the summer there. Davey and I were still too young, by a year, to go, but we knew that next year would be our year to take part in the program. That was why we’d been sent to ASU in the first place. By the end of the semester, we’d managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA, and fully establish ourselves as regular, if a little young, students at ASU. During the summer, Davey and I spent several weeks at an ‘intensive’ Slavic-language program being offered by Rutgers. Davey was in a staged ‘accident’ that resulted in him needing to have some plastic surgery. At first I didn’t like the way his nose had been changed, or the slightly different shape of his eyes, but the changes grew on me after a while. “Dude, I like the new nose.” Trevor said when we met up with him and Todd over the summer. Brandon and Sean were taking summer session courses at MIT, and we’d just missed them by two days. “Shut up.” Davey responded to Trevor sharply. He’d always been a little sensitive about his nose, and now that it was narrower, and no longer had that little ‘hump’ halfway down, I could see him staring at himself in the mirror a lot. His eyes were more almond-shaped now as well, but the changes were less immediately noticeable. “So, other than your face getting smashed up, everything else is alright after your car accident?” Todd asked in a slightly worried tone. “Yes, everything’s fine.” Davey assured our old friends. Not even they were to be told yet about the real reasons why the surgery had happened. For that matter, we didn’t even know the full story yet. Phoenix was still hot when we returned for the new semester. Sure, Modesto got hot during the summer months, but it never got quite as hot as Phoenix. Once again we got a good dorm room and went through the typical routine of unpacking and setting our room up for the next year. Within a few days we were settled in and ready to begin the next round of classes. Last year, we’d finished the highest level of undergraduate Russian language courses that were regularly offered, so this year we were given special upper-division classes where we studied under two professors. We also were assigned as ‘assistants’ to the beginning-level courses, and as the months wore on, found ourselves making a fairly lucrative business in tutoring some students. Most of the students we tutored were freshmen, and were usually only a year or two older than us. That led to a situation that had me very nervous, and caused one of the most serious arguments yet. Matt Stoler was a handsome young man, eighteen, and he kept looking at Davey in a way that made me very nervous. Worse yet, Davey responded to his smiles with smiles of his own, and the body language between the two of them was far more friendly than made me comfortable. “Brian, you worried about me and Todd when we first got together.” Davey said with a hint of scorn in his voice when I broached the topic. “After all these years I’d have thought you could learn to trust me by now.” “I do trust you.” I told him. “I don’t trust Matt.” “It takes two to tango, Brian.” Davey said in a warning tone. His statement worked both ways, really. He was telling me that nothing would happen because he wouldn’t let it, and he was telling me that it took both of us to make our relationship work, or to not work.” “You’re right.” I said with a sigh. “I’m sorry. It’s just that, well, you look so damn good I know you could have any guy you wanted…” “I only want you, Brian.” He said in a tone that made my heart melt. That night I was sure our neighbors heard what we were doing, but we didn’t really care. It was too much fun. It was the day before we left for Thanksgiving when something happened that affirmed my reasons for worrying. Davey was tutoring Matt in our dorm room while I was out supervising a make-up exam for Professor Lee. It was an oral exam, with the students having to recite several poems, and afterwards I spent an extra half-hour with two of them, helping them to fix their pronunciation of certain words. After I was done, I headed back to our dorm room, and was just opening the door when I heard the familiar sounds of two people kissing. There was Davey and Matt, whose back was to me, kissing on my bed! Instead of erupting and making a scene, I started to close the door with a sinking heart when Matt fell to the floor. With the door just open a crack, I couldn’t see much, but I could hear what was being said, and my heart started to climb back out of my feet. Matt was on the floor because Davey had pushed him there. “What do you think you’re doing?” Davey snarled angrily. “I… uh… I thought you were…” Matt stammered with real fright in his voice. “You thought what?” Davey snarled again. “I thought you were… you know… like me.” Matt stammered even more. “You know… gay.” “Yeah, I’m gay.” Davey stated with anger dripping off of every syllable. “What makes you think you can kiss me, though?” “I’m sorry.” Matt said softly. “I just thought if you were gay, you wouldn’t mind hooking up. I mean, everyone says you and Brian are both gay.” “We’re a couple.” Davey said firmly. “I’m not interested in anyone but him. If you knew that we were gay, what made you think I’d cheat on him?” “You’re a guy, aren’t you?” Matt shot back and Davey laughed. “Just because I’m a guy, don’t think that means I’ll cheat on someone I love.” Davey said around his laughter. “Brian and I have been together for longer than you’d believe, and I’m not about to risk my relationship with him, no matter how cute someone is.” “You think I’m cute?” Matt said in a pleased tone. “You’re easy enough on the eyes.” Davey said. “Brian’s better though.” “Oh.” Matt said softly. “I’m sorry I misunderstood.” “Just don’t try something like that again.” Davey said firmly, and I walked away from the room. When I came back an hour later, Davey smiled as I handed him a dozen red roses. “You heard, didn’t you?” Davey asked with a smile. “Yep.” I admitted with a slight blush. “What did you see?” Davey asked curiously. “I opened the door when he was kissing you.” I was blushing furiously now. “And you didn’t make a scene?” Davey asked with a tilt of his head. “I heard you push him to the floor, and stayed around to hear the rest of the conversation.” I admitted, looking at the floor. “So you know you can trust me, don’t you?” Davey said softly, but there was an edge to his voice. “Yes, and I’m sorry I ever doubted you.” I said softly. “You were right though, too, about what he was after.” Davey gave me that much. “Thanks for the roses.” “They’re not half as beautiful as you.” I said, and that got me a very deep, passionate kiss. It was the day after Thanksgiving when Trevor’s father called Davey and invited us to his house that evening. Davey and I were both a little confused when we arrived and found that Trevor and Mrs. Rush were both gone, and two men were waiting with Mr. Rush. We recognized one of them as the ‘handler’ we’d been working with from the CIA. “Mr. Breckenridge, Mr. Jones, this is Walter Ameson, my supervisor.” Richard Long, the handler introduced us to the older man with white hair. “I was surprised when Mr. Long called me and said he needed my help.” Mr. Rush said as we all sat back down. “It has been some years since I had contact with the Agency. I was more surprised when I found out you two boys were involved with them. You have not gotten Trevor involved in whatever this is, have you?” “No, sir.” Davey said cautiously while Long nodded. “What’s going on?” “You two young men have expressed an interest in working with the Agency while you were still in High School.” Ameson explained. “I believe you both remember your summer internships. Your group of friends and you had some strange ideas, but they are starting to appear not to be as far-fetched as we first assumed. Unfortunately, our operations are not geared towards obtaining the kind of information we would need to verify some of the theories that are now being kicked around by our analysts. That is where you come in, Mr. Jones.” “Me?” Davey asked with surprise. “Yes, you.” Mr. Long added. “You’ve been very good about doing what we ask without demanding an explanation. Now, your patience is about to pay off.” “We were quite nervous when Mr. Long brought up this idea, especially since it centered on such a young person.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “Still, you appear to be quite an unusual young man, very mature, and we are going to take this risk.” “What risk?” Davey asked cautiously. “Davey, you were born here in Modesto, right?” Mr. Rush asked. “Yes, at Modesto City Hospital.” Davey stated. “Trevor was born at the same hospital.” Mr. Rush stated. “It was six weeks after you, as you know.” “Yes.” Davey murmured. “My wife and I were at the hospital the same night you were born.” Mr. Rush said and Davey’s eyebrows rose. “In fact, I think I remember seeing your mother brought in to the Labor and Delivery area. She was quite…vocal about wanting you out of her.” “I can imagine.” Davey said with a slightly stunned look on his face. I was surprised too, since this was the first I’d heard of it in three timelines. Trevor’s parents had been there the night Davey was born? “Do you not wonder why we were at the hospital?” Mr. Rush asked and Davey nodded. “You see, my sister was pregnant at almost the same time as my wife. They were only a month apart.” “I’ve never met your sister.” Davey said quietly. “She died in childbirth.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “I’m sorry.” Davey said immediately and Mr. Rush shrugged it off. “She went into labor three weeks early.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “She didn’t know it, but she was bearing twins. Something went wrong inside of her, and she went into labor prematurely. The first boy was delivered without too much trouble, but the second had gotten the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck during the birth process. The hospital was a mess that night with your mother and three other women, all giving birth at the same time. The twins were fraternal, not identical. You do understand the difference?” “Fraternal are from different eggs inseminated at the same time instead of one egg that splits into two separate embryos.” Davey said automatically. “Yes.” Mr. Rush continued. “The second twin died before he could be delivered by emergency cesarean section. My sister also died later that night.” “I’m very sorry.” Davey said quietly. “What happened to the one that survived?” “He was returned to his father.” Mr. Rush frowned. “I am still sorry about that.” Mr. Ameson said to Mr. Rush. “He found out about the delivery and there was nothing we could do to prevent it when he made the demand.” “What does…” Davey began to ask, mostly to cover the fact we already knew Mr. Rush was a defector. In this timeline we were not supposed to know that. “I was not born in the United States.” Mr. Rush said, in Russian. Davey and I both managed to put appropriate expressions of surprise on our faces. “Sereosna?” Davey asked in Russian, the word for ‘seriously’. “Pravda.” Mr. Ameson replied with a slight smile. Simply put, he was saying it was ‘truth’. “My wife and I came to the United States because we did not want our child born under communism.” Mr. Rush continued in English. Then he told the story we’d heard before, except this time we found out that his sister had come with him. From the expression on his face, I could understand why that had never been mentioned before. It seemed the memory was very painful for him, and it explained why he had very rarely spoken of it in any of the timelines. His sister had been a secretary for a mid-level bureaucrat in the Foreign Affairs office. She had helped them arrange their defection, and gone with them. The father of her unborn children was an older man, who would now be in his early sixties, and had not had any children by his wife. After the mother had died in childbirth, he had demanded his son be returned to him, and legally there had been no way to stop him short of creating an international incident. “The boy, Dmitry Verakov, died about a year ago in an auto accident while vacationing in Eastern Europe.” Mr. Ameson continued the story after Mr. Rush fell silent. He took out a picture from a briefcase next to his chair and showed it to us. Several things fell into place at once. “You want to use Davey to get close to this man.” I said while Davey stared at the picture. The young guy in the picture was handsome, and he looked a lot like Davey, in fact, with the changes to Davey’s appearance, I’d have very few doubts they were brothers. “Did the other twin really die?” Davey asked in quiet voice, and Mr. Long chuckled. “Are you thinking maybe you were adopted?” He asked Davey with a very amused expression. “This guy looks a lot like me.” Davey said, pointing at the picture. “Not only that, he has the same blood type as you.” Mr. Ameson added. “Although, if a genetic test were to be done, you’d find that you do not really share his genetics. It is just a fortuitous resemblance, and the fact that your blood type is the same is an even bigger stroke of luck.” “So I’m not really…” Davey’s voice drifted off. “No, you are no relation to Mikhail Markovich Verakov, although when he sees you we believe that he will suspect a great deal.” Mr. Ameson stated. “A check of your blood type will prove that you could be his son, and that will likely be enough for him. He is currently a high-level assistant to the Politburo member responsible for overseeing domestic production of consumer goods in the Soviet Union. As such, he has access to much of the economic data that we have failed to acquire.” “You want me to get him to defect?” Davey asked. “If it’s possible.” Ameson stated. “If not, wiggle your way into his life, his home, and learn as much as you can. Pass that information to Mr. Breckenridge, who will bring it back to the United States. Make Verakov believe that you are his lost son. His wife died two years ago, and his son last year. He is a very lonely man right now.” “And the whole idea is just plain insane.” Davey said with disbelief. “What makes you think I can do this?” “Please, Mr. Jones, you’re quite capable of hiding secrets.” Mr. Long said with a snort. “It took us until two months ago to verify that you and Mr. Breckenridge are homosexuals in a long-term relationship. We still have not been able to find out when that relationship started. Three FBI agents doing background checks on you both failed to uncover that information.” “Matt.” Davey said flatly and Mr. Long grinned. “He didn’t know who he was doing it for, just that he was being paid to see if he could seduce you.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “That is why we are including Mr. Breckenridge in this. We assume you will not wish to go without him.” “Aren’t you worried that Verakov will find out and get mad?” Davey asked. “When it comes to the children of powerful men like him, the Soviet Union will often turn a blind eye.” Ameson stated. “Well, that or they’ll seek to use it as a hammer hanging over his head if he steps out of line. No, both of you should be quite safe when they find out about your relationship.” “You make it sound like it is for certain.” I stated. “Yes, Mr. Breckenridge.” Long said with a grin. “Both of your files will indicate that you were rejected for service with the Agency because of your sexual preference. It is the policy of the United States that homosexuals are not to be trusted.” “But you trust us.” I stated with a raised eyebrow. “Call me an enlightened individual.” Long said with a shrug. “You both are very unique individuals.” Ameson added. “We would not normally even think of such a hairbrained scheme as this, but you are both fairly mature, obviously able to keep secrets without looking like you’re keeping secrets, and have shown yourselves to be dependable. If you accept this plan, this will be the last time we officially meet. The two of you will apply for the Study Abroad program that is scheduled for next summer. You will both be eighteen by then, and legal adults.” “While you are there, you will be invited to attend several events.” Long continued. “At least one of those will be attended by comrade Verakov. He often gets sent in the place of his boss. Make sure that you meet him, and if possible speak to him. Let him take things from there. Mr. Jones, you will use Mr. Breckenridge to pass any information learned out of the Soviet Union. We suggest that if an offer for you to stay with comrade Verakov is made, that you accept. Mr. Breckenridge should be able to pass back and forth between the United States and the Soviet Union every few months.” “Mr. Breckenridge, you will pass your information along through Mr. Rush.” Ameson took up the explanation. “We suggest you write nothing down, nor take any incriminating photographs. Both of you have shown that your memory is near-perfect. That is the safest way for you to pass information to each other. Mr. Rush can put it in written form, and send the reports in through his regular channels.” “You will both be paid for your work, if this succeeds.” Long finished. “We will protect your identities by listing you as being denied for service, but Mr. Rush will receive a significant raise in his living allowance that we pay him. When this is over, I believe you both trust him enough to pay you appropriately.” “We trust him.” Davey didn’t hesitate to reply but he got a worried look on his face. “How long am I supposed to do this for?” “Until Mr. Verakov dies, retires, or the Soviet Union ceases to exist.” Ameson stated and Davey looked at me with a worried expression. “Brian?” “It’s up to you.” I told him. “You’re the one who wanted to get involved with the bloody Agency.” “I… you know… I… uh… I can’t do this. Sorry.” Davey stammered after a moment. “Why not?” Ameson asked with a frown. “I… Brian doesn’t really want to be involved in this cloak and dagger stuff and I won’t drag him along.” Davey said. “You’re right, we are a couple, and we’d have to do this together or not at all.” “Thank you, Davey.” I said quietly, putting a hand on his shoulder and not caring about the other men in the room. “But you know you want to do this, don’t you?” “Yes, but…” Davey protested. “We’ll do it.” I said to Ameson who nodded, although he was obviously trying not to look at my hand on Davey’s shoulder. “Why?” Long said. “It’ll help our country, and Davey really wants to do it.” I said with a shrug. “I like spoiling him.” “I love you.” Davey breathed out in a whisper, and he was smiling from ear to ear. Chapter 24 It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.”",

      "content": "“We’re all twelve now, right?” I asked and got nods all around. “Should we be having sex?” Brandon asked. “Well, it’s not like we weren’t playing around at this age anyway.” Trevor said, but then he gave me a look. “Well, most of us were anyway.” “Aren’t we all like virgins again?” Todd asked. “I know I am.” “So am I, physically.” Sean said, but he was grinning at Brandon. “For right now, at least.” “So am I, but I don’t see why we shouldn’t have fun.” I said with a shrug. “I mean, we’re all pretty established in our relationships, right?” “Yeah, that’s for sure.” Davey said with a smile. “Just remember, coming out right now isn’t going to be fun or easy.” Sean reminded all of us. “My parents, and Davey’s at least will have conniption fits and we’re too young to get emancipated yet.” “I hate being young again.” Davey moaned. “You lose so many privileges that being an adult gets you.” “It takes some adjustment.” I agreed. “Some of us have it easier than others, and we should make sure our families get used to us spending a lot of time together. For now, my place, or Trevor’s will be the best place to get together as a group.” “Oh yeah, a lot of trips to the barn.” Brandon said with a leer at Sean. “You really are cute at this age, you know. Then again you’re cute at any age.” “You’re just saying that because your twelve-year old hormones are talking.” Sean teased back, but he was smiling as the bell rang. “Ah, crap, we got class.” Trevor groaned, and we all headed into the school as a group. A few of our ‘friends’ from this time gave us odd looks because Todd, Sean and Davey weren’t normally part of our group, but they’d get used to that in time. Time. We had so much time to plan now, and while it was true I hadn’t been able to do more than lay out the basic elements of how to secure access to the time machine and get us all back here, but I had spent plenty of time over the last years in that other timeline planning on what to do when we got here. First off was to get reestablished in our younger bodies, and our younger lives. There were other things to take care of, but that would take a little bit longer. I intended to make sure that no other time machine could be built, and to do that someone would have to die. The easiest would be the scientist. While my friends had by and large balked at the idea of killing the soldiers and others that would be in the chamber with us, I had been able to adapt those plans to non-lethal means. Sean and Davey, though, had shown no squeamishness at killing, and they would be the ones to help me with the plans for the scientist that had started this whole chain of events. We had years, though, before we needed to take those steps. For now, the most important thing was to just enjoy the fact that instead of being a lonely time traveler, we were all in our younger bodies, and we all remembered our friendships and relationships with each other. There would be no dancing around, trying to reestablish what had been begun in a previous timeline. I just did my best to not think about certain things that couldn’t be changed. Uncle Rich already had AIDS, and he’d die around Christmastime this year. Going back earlier might have changed that, but the fact was we knew that at this age our bodies were able to handle the adult memories of past lives. Going back further endangered that, as Davey learned in my original timeline. Saving Uncle Rich just wasn’t worth that risk. First period English was fun, but jock math was absolute hell for me. By whispered agreement, those of us in that class (Trevor, Davey, and I) agreed we’d get out of it after the first week and into a more advanced math. Davey joined Brandon, Trevor and me for lunch, while Sean and Todd visited with some of their old friends. While we were all good friends as young adults, the truth was that we moved in different circles during Junior and Senior High, and while we were going to be making many changes, they didn’t all need to start on the first day. After practice we all met in a nearby park, sitting together at one of the wooden benches that dotted the area. We had the area pretty much to ourselves, and wouldn’t have to worry about a parent coming in and hearing us talk about things they wouldn’t be prepared to understand. It was pretty obvious the younger hormones were kicking in, because there was a lot of physical contact between the various couples as we sat down to talk. “Ugh, this is going to drive me insane.” Trevor groaned as Todd sat next to him. “You’ve got a barn, invite me to dinner.” Todd teased him and Trevor growled. “You’re coming to dinner.” “Geez, twist my arm, why don’t ya?” Todd laughed. “Where are we going?” Sean asked Brandon. “There’s some bushes over there.” Brandon said with a jerk of his head. “We have those reserved.” Davey added. “Business first?” I asked, hating to break up the horny banter. I knew only part of it was from actual horniness. Most came from the fact that we’d succeeded in fooling several powerful people over several very tense years. “Yeah, okay, how do we prevent World War III?” Davey asked in a mock-serious tone. “We kill the bad Russian.” Trevor offered. “Better yet, we kill the scientist.” Todd offered. “Um, didn’t you guys hesitate at…” I started to suggest but Brandon shook his head. “That was different.” Brandon said. “Those guys were innocent.” “Yeah.” Trevor agreed. “Yup.” Todd added. “Well, we’ve got years before that is necessary.” I pointed out. “In fact, we should probably wait until we’re at least sixteen or seventeen and don’t have to depend on others for transportation.” “But you have an idea about how to do it, right?” Davey asked. “I’m thinking either a car accident, or poison.” I admitted. “I’d lean towards car accident but we have to make sure it’s fatal. We’ll spend a few months observing him and his movements, and work out a more exact plan once we’re older. They don’t come back until 1988, remember?” “That’s right, so there’ll be in plenty of time.” Sean smiled. “Okay, so what about between now and then?” Trevor asked. “Do we just lay low, be normal students or whatever, keep the fact that we’re fucking like bunnies a secret and just live life or do we do something?” “Sean, you said when you came back that my plans to help alleviate the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union didn’t work.” I stated. “Is it fair to say the problem was what I expected, that there wasn’t enough time between 1988 and 1991?” “That was what you decided before I came back.” Sean answered. “You said ground work would have to be made several years earlier in order to get a better impact.” “So, a question for all of us.” I said and was glad that the playfulness had died down. Everyone was as serious as could be right now. “Do we live our lives as normally as possible, not showing we already know what we’re learning in classes, or do we do something different?” “You’re not talking about admitting to the government we’re time travelers, are you?” Davey asked suspiciously. “Hell no.” I snorted. “That’s just asking for trouble, especially once they believe us. No. You know, we’re just an extraordinary group of geniuses who manage to learn very fast and learn at a very accelerated rate. If we play it right, we can be finishing up high school by the time we’re fifteen, and we can be in the right schools, at the right time to advance the right theories to the right people a few years earlier.” “But, our friends…” Todd started to protest and then he sighed. “Why do I see your faces being in my future for decades?” “We’ll make other friends along the way, but at least we’ll always have each other to fall back on.” Davey said with an appreciative look on his face. “I mean, think about what we’ve been through, what we’ve done. I know all of you will always be important to me for the rest of my life.” “Aw, how sweet.” Sean said in a mock-moan, but everyone had embarrassed smiles on their faces. “So how do we do this?” Trevor asked. “I mean, is there anyone who isn’t onboard with this idea?” “Nope.” Several of them said at once. Then everyone looked at me again. Even though Sean had come back in the last timeline, I was still the ‘oldest’ of them, and had all the knowledge of the original Davey Jones at my recall. “For now, we just ace every quiz, every test and we make it very obvious to our teachers that we’re extremely bored with their work.” I explained easily. “They should get the hint within a month, and if any of them don’t we’ll take other steps through my aunt. Their next step should be to give us new assessment tests, where we’ll do everything but the absolutely most difficult questions. I don’t think any of us except maybe Davey and Trevor will have problems with the math parts.” “Yeah, I might fail that part.” Davey said with a chortle. He’d always hated math. “That should give the teachers a conundrum to deal with, and we’ll probably be accused of cheating.” I continued with a laugh. “So, we’ll probably end up taking the tests again, and we should perform about the same. After a lot of head scratching, our parents will probably come talk to us about skipping a grade or two. Maybe even sending all of us to a special school. We should end up freshmen somewhere, and from there it’ll be a few years until we get our high school diplomas and move on to college.” “No sports then.” Trevor said with a frown. “Well, we might be able to figure something out there, although we’ll definitely be at a disadvantage with our lack of development.” I said with a shrug. “We can always do three-on-three.” Davey said, and then blushed as a few of the guys chuckled. “Sorry, not on our backs.” “Don’t get kinky, Jones.” Todd grumbled playfully. “What careers do we get this time?” Sean asked. “I mean, I like physics and all, but I’d really like to go into computers.” “I really want to focus on computers too.” Brandon added. “Some of the stuff that was coming out there before we left, it was pretty damn cool.” “I want to do the political stuff again.” Davey said with a smile and then he shrugged when everyone groaned. “Hey, I like it!” “I know.” Todd added. “I’m not sure what I want to do right now.” “Me neither.” Trevor added. “We don’t have to decide now.” I reminded them. “You’ve got a year or two. Remember, we’re going to know more than other kids our age, but that doesn’t necessarily make us geniuses. We’re still going to have to learn things, but we’ll have a head start. That’s the main thing to remember. When we get back into college, it’ll be slower going again.” “Got it.” Trevor murmured. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, Todd needs to see my barn and what it looked like in 1981.” “Have fun.” Davey leered at them and he grinned at me. “Want to walk me home, Brian? You might not know this, but your place is on the way to where I live now.” “Sure.” I agreed while Brandon and Sean got up, heading for some bushes without even a word to us. “I do love you.” Davey said softly as we began the walk home. “You know, I’ve got some changes to make with my father.” “Stopping him from molesting Jenny, yes.” I agreed. “If we leave too soon for some advanced school, I won’t be able to do that.” Davey said. “Any suggestions on how to go about this?” “Start with Jenny.” I offered and he nodded. “You mean talk to her about inappropriate touching and stuff, and how even if it was your parent you should tell someone, or better yet, scream as loud as you can to stop it from happening?” He threw out several ideas, all of them good. “I think we’re on the right track.” I replied as we kept walking and talking. When we got to my place, we walked up and in the front door together, and for a moment we both totally forgot that my parents had not met him yet. “You’re home late.” Mom said a little tightly. “And who is this?” “Oh, um, yeah, sorry mom.” I said with a wry grin. “This is my new best friend, Davey Jones. I thought you should meet him since you’re going to be seeing a lot of him from now on.” “Well, that was quite an introduction.” Mom said with an odd look on her face, but she smiled at Davey and shook his hand. “I think my son might have just fallen in love.” “It might be puppy love.” Davey said dead-pan. “I better watch it in case he decides to start humping my leg.” The look on mom’s face was priceless, and I couldn’t decide if she was going to not like Davey, or fall over laughing. She ended up laughing so hard there were tears in her eyes. “Oh my, your Uncle Rich is going to love hearing this.” Mom said to me as she began to get control over herself. “That’s your uncle in the City, right?” Davey said to me with a wink. “You’re going to have to take me to meet him sometime.” “How about this weekend?” I asked and looked at mom who was looking at us with surprise. “Do you think Uncle Rich might like some visitors?” “I’m sure he’d love to have you guys visit, but um, Brian, are you sure that…” Mom’s voice trailed off as she looked uncomfortably at Davey. “Don’t worry, ma’am, Brian’s already told me about his gay uncle, and no it doesn’t bother me at all.” Davey said with a smile. “My dad’s the hellfire and brimstone preacher, not me. I tend to take a more relaxed view of the world.” “I see.” She said with a twinkle in her eye. “Brian, where did you find this guy?” “On the way to school.” I answered. “Well, would you boys like a snack or something?” Mom asked as she recovered. “No thanks, ma’am.” Davey said with a smile. “I need to get home before Mom gets off work. She probably expects me to have done my chores instead of goofing off with this lug.” “Well, it was nice to meet you.” Mom said with a genuine smile. “I’ll have to meet your parents some day.” “I’m sure you will, ma’am.” Davey said with a twinkle in his eyes and I walked him to the door. She was still watching us, so we couldn’t kiss, but he did mouth ‘I love you’ before turning and walking away. “He’s quite a character.” Mom repeated when I shut the door. “I take it you had a good first day of school?” “You wouldn’t believe how good of a day.” I told her with a smile. The night was odd, I realized as I had nothing to do, really. The few chores I finished before dinner, and something in me wanted to be out, celebrating with my friends, and with Davey, but I knew that could not happen just yet. I spent several hours watching television with my parents, talking with them a little before heading into my room for bed. Twice while I thought about Davey I managed to jerk off, amazed at the sharpness, the almost overpowering level of sensations that rushed through my body. It really was different. “I don’t mind walking, mom.” I told my mother the next day as I waited for Davey. He showed up with his sister in tow. She really was a cute little girl, but she was giving Davey the oddest looks. It wasn’t until we left her at El Vista and headed on to our own school that I found out why. “When I got home last night, I found she’d gotten into my room, taken all my Star Wars action figures and had them in her room playing with her Barbie dolls.” Davey chuckled. “You should have seen her face. She was sitting there, fully prepared for me to launch into a tirade and for us to get in a fight.” “What did you do?” I asked with a smile. Oh yes, younger siblings could do such challenging things all the time. “I told her that when she was done, she’d better put them back where she found them.” Davey laughed. “Then, later, when Mom got home she whined that I was telling her what to do!” “What did your Mom say?” I asked. “She asked what I’d told Jenny to do, and Jenny told her that I was demanding she put away my toys.” Davey laughed with a shake of his head. “Mom turned to me and before she could say anything, I said ‘The toys she took out of my room and was playing with in her room.’ Mom turned right back around and told Jenny if she didn’t do what I told her, she would be grounded. I swear, if I’d known I’d get that sort of reaction, I’d have done that the first time around.” “It is nice having an older perspective.” I said. “Yeah, but there’s nice things about being younger again, too.” Davey said with a look I knew all too well. His voice dropped an octave. “I thought I was about to leap out of my body when I came last night thinking about you.” “Yeah, me too.” I admitted with a slight blush. “So, when are we going to sneak off somewhere?” He asked me. “Come over to my house after school.” I told him. “Mom’s going to be gone to her sister’s.” “Sounds good to me.” Davey said with a smile. “We can break your bed in again.” “I like that idea.” I said before we met up with our friends at the end of the bike path across from the school. We were fifteen minutes early, but everyone was there. “We need to talk some more about this whole idea.” Trevor said after we’d gotten the greetings out of the way. “I’m not sure if I want to go this route, and Brian, you’re always talking about how our biggest problems stem from us not fully thinking our way through things. We need to be careful about this.” “I agree.” I told him. “Good.” Todd added his agreement and everyone nodded their heads as well. That afternoon, in my house void of any parents, Davey and I managed to get our clothes off and explore our younger bodies. The equipment wasn’t full grown yet, but oh the feelings they generated! Both of us were far too noisy when we climaxed, and we lay there on the bed, together, panting and totally drained afterwards. “That was too good.” Davey said softly. “I’d forgotten what it was like. No wonder people get screwed up having sex too young. It’s just too intense for thought.” “Yep.” I agreed with him before slipping into a light doze. Fortunately Mom’s car in the driveway woke us both, and we got dressed in plenty of time before she made it inside. “Oh, hi Davey!” Mom said with a smile when we came out of the bedroom. “I didn’t know you were here.” “Brian and I were doing some homework.” Davey said with a theatrical sigh. “Those darn teachers! They’ve already got us doing homework!” “I’m sure you’ll survive.” She said with a little laugh. “Were you serious about going to the City this weekend?” He asked both her and me at the same time. “I did talk to Rich today, and he’s free if you boys wanted to visit.” Mom said with a look at me. “That sounds good.” I agreed. “My parents said I could go, but they want to meet you and Mr. B first.” Davey said to her. “Do you think your parents would like to come over for dinner on Thursday?” Mom asked. “As long as we bring my brat of a sister, they’ll probably be delighted.” Davey said and she laughed. “Oh, you have a sister?” She asked and he answered, talking about Jenny for a good five minutes. Poor Mom, Davey had her number already and she didn’t stand a chance against his manipulations. He’d have her eating out of his hand by the end of the week, and it was fun to watch. Oh yes, this was going to be the best timeline ever. Chapter 22 “I don’t know quite what to say, Brian.” Uncle Rich’s voice was weak, and he looked like death warmed over in his hospital bed. An I.V. line pumped liquids into him, but it was only a matter of time, hours, maybe a day or two if he was really lucky. He knew it as well as I did, sitting in this ward of the hospital in San Francisco. Outside it was Christmas, and people were celebrating the holiday with their families. I was too, in my own way, but it was a far different celebration. “I’m sorry, Uncle Rich.” I said softly, still holding his hand. His grip was weak, but he squeezed my hand as tightly as he could. “Don’t be, boy.” He said before a coughing fit took him. He punched the button on the morphine drip, and sighed as more of the drug flowed into his system. I knew he’d be asleep before long, and it would be wrong to keep Mom out of the room for much longer. Her, and her sister, and my father were all here, but I’d begged a few hours alone with him, and gotten them. “If we’d come back earlier, I might have warned you in time.” I said softly. “But we couldn’t quite arrange it perfectly.” “It’s almost too hard to believe, but you sound like you’re serious, so I’m going to believe you.” Rich said weakly, his voice relaxing as the drug eased his pain. “It certainly explains your sudden stroke of genius and them wanting to skip you ahead a few grades.” “It does, doesn’t it?” I said with a small smile. “Thank you, Uncle Rich. The last few months have been wonderful seeing you so much, you know.” “You’ve been a good nephew, and I like your friend, a lot.” Rich said with a chuckle. “Brenda doesn’t quite see it, but I was damn sure you two were a couple before you told me all this time travel stuff. Fated lovers. Got to love that. You be good to each other, you hear me? Stay faithful to each other too, with this damn disease. I wish you could do something about that.” “We’re trying.” I assured him. “We have to be subtle, but we’re pretty sure we found a way to get the right information to the right people without raising too many questions.” “That’s good.” He said before closing his eyes. His breathing was still shallow, but it was pain-free, and he was obviously asleep. I stood up, kissed his forehead and walked out of the room. “He’s asleep.” I said to Mom, who was standing outside with Aunt Linda and Dad. “Did you two say goodbye?” Mom asked and I nodded, letting the tears slide down my face. We really had said goodbye, and I’d had to ask forgiveness for not coming back further in time to save him. At least he’d given me that forgiveness. “Why don’t we go for a walk, son?” Dad said in a gentle voice as the two women went back into the room. I nodded, and we walked out of the hospital into the cool San Francisco morning. It would have been nice if Davey could have been here, but his parents had firmly put their foot down against his visiting over Christmas. There had been a big enough fight when they’d found out that Uncle Rich was sick, and with what. That had nearly shattered the budding friendship between our parents, but we were working on it. “How are you feeling, son?” Dad asked after we’d gone a few blocks. “Better.” I told him. “So much is changing.” Dad said sadly. “Your mother is going to be grieving for a while. You do understand that it isn’t likely…” “He’ll be gone in hours, or maybe a few days at most.” I said sadly. “I’ll miss him.” “I will too.” Dad said. “He’s a good man. It’s a shame he’s dying.” “It is.” I agreed. “How are you feeling about starting your new school?” Dad asked, changing the subject. “Are you sure you want this? You’ll be far away from home. I don’t know how your mother will deal with you being gone to a boarding school.” “I’ll be coming back every couple of months, and all summer.” I reminded him with a smile. He just shook his head. “I know, it’s not the same, but really, I can get a better education there, and I think that’s what I should do. It’s not like I’m going to be alone, either. That’s why we all decided to stop pretending on our school work, because we realized we weren’t alone, and we had friends.” “You do have an amazing group of friends.” Dad agreed. “Still, your mother and I are going to miss having you around.” “Do you think this… argument over Uncle Rich is going to scuttle the plans you’ve been making with Mr. Jones?” I asked him and Dad looked surprised. “No, oddly enough, I don’t think so.” Dad said. “We even talked about that before we drove up here. You were already in bed, but he called wanting to make sure that I wasn’t so pissed off I was going to pull out. It’s a good idea, a good business plan, and we’ve already gotten the loans approved to get started. He may be a little stuffy about social stuff, but he’s a good talker and will make a good face for the business while I handle all the financial issues.” “Plus Mrs. Jones is a pretty good organizer, isn’t she?” I asked, pleased at how Davey and I had pulled off the project of getting our parents into business together. The combination of all four of them working together would help a lot of things, especially with his sister. His father was going to be too busy, and too happy to fall into the emotional state that had led to him molesting his daughter. “She is, she is.” Dad agreed. “The more I get to know them, the more amazed I am by them as a family. Sandy’s father is a blast.” “Dad, stop trying to use cool words.” I told my father and he laughed. By the time we had returned to the hospital, Mom and Aunt Linda were ready for dinner. After a good meal, everyone returned to Uncle Rich’s room, and it was time. I could feel it in the room, and part of me fell apart as his two sisters each held one of Uncle Rich’s hands. He’d been awake, but not really coherent when we came back from dinner. He’d quieted down and smiled though when they held his hands, and so they stood like that for several hours, none of us moving at all until his eyes closed for the last time, and his lungs exhaled for the very last time. While Dad held Mom, I held Aunt Linda who was crying just as hard as my mother. We cleared the room while nurses and a doctor filed in to do all the official things they have to do, and we tried to comfort the two women. My own eyes were filled with tears, and I had to struggle to remember the forgiveness I’d been given for not stopping this. It really was a sad Christmas, but at least there was some more healing to be done after we returned home to Modesto. We’d pulled in and I was still unloading the car when a familiar brown Buick pulled up in front of our house. Mr. Jones was dressed in one of his best suits, and Mrs. Jones was wearing what looked like a new dress as they got out of the car. Even Davey was wearing a suit, and Jenny had on a very pretty dress as well as they walked up the driveway towards me. “Davey told us of your loss, Brian.” David Jones, Sr. said in a quiet, deep voice. “How are you holding up?” “I’m well, sir.” I said quietly, returning his politeness with politeness of my own. “It went as well as one could hope. Uncle Rich was surrounded by his family up until the very end.” “As it should be.” He said with a slight bow of his head. “Do you think your parents would be up for visitors?” “I think they’ll be happy to see you.” I offered and he smiled slightly as Davey took the suitcase I was holding and I led his family up to my house. Mom and Dad were talking quietly in the dining room when we walked in, and at first they looked wary, but that quickly changed to grateful appreciation for their visitors. “You have no idea how much preaching I had to do.” Davey whispered to me as we stood out on the back porch while the adults were still inside, talking over coffee (and tea for Sandy). Jenny was in the living room watching television. “I took his own damn bible and started pulling out every bible verse I could find about love and forgiveness. Considering we were at Nanny’s, and all the family was there, it turned into a free-for-all bible study session. When Papa came in on my side, I knew I’d won. “I knew you could do it.” I congratulated him softly and he blushed slightly. Making sure our parents stayed on good terms was important to both of us for a variety of reasons. My last time around, I’d taken the approach that I had plenty of years to make changes, but Sean had disabused me of that notion with our failure to stop the mad scientist and the power-hungry communist. Instead of just enjoying our collective new teenage years, we were going to take steps. Besides, as Trevor remarked, it got kind of old after a month. Even I’d forgotten the big differences between being twelve and being seventeen. We all had bed times that were far too early, our parents watched us a lot, a lot more than we were used to having to deal with, and of course none of us could legally drive. What had been a short car drive over to someone’s house turned into twenty or thirty minutes of bike riding, jogging, or begging for a ride from a parent. Sure, the school we were going to had a lot more restrictions in some ways, but in other ways it also had a lot more freedoms for us, and it would accelerate us on the path of making some changes. It was shortly after the New Year, 1982, when we all flew up to our new school with our parents. The school was a very private, very exclusive Military Preparatory Academy in the backwoods of upstate New York. I know most kids get threatened with being sent off to a military school if they are bad, but in this case there couldn’t have been a better fit for all of us. I had heard of the school in my original timeline because I’d worked with one person who had gone there. The man was a career diplomat in the State Department and one of the best at what he did. He had given full credit to the General John Cleveland Robinson Academy for giving him many of the skills he used in his work. As a private school, it accepted only students that it had invited to attend, and I was surprised when we received invitations in late November. Almost never did any school of this type offer mid-term admissions, and for all six of us to receive invitations was an opportunity I hoped we, as a group, would not pass up. After looking at their academic offerings, most of us were onboard with going there (especially since there were scholarships involved so that all of us could afford to attend), but the deciding factor for Trevor was the fact that they did have a football team. The school was your typical private boarding school, located on fairly large grounds that were well maintained, circled by a wall, and had uniformed guards at the front gate. There were four main large, multi-story buildings, and several smaller buildings as well as what looked like a fairly impressive sports complex all visible through the trees as we drove up the main drive. At the main building, an older man dressed in the uniform of an Army Colonel met us, and pleasantly greeted our parents before greeting the six of us who would be attending the school. “I am Colonel Barry Reynolds, the Deputy Superintendent of the Academy, and Professor of Military History.” He said by way of his own introduction. For the next hour, he personally led us on a tour of the facility, mostly directed at our parents. Then after introducing another man who was also an instructor there, we were separated from our parents and the real introductions began. “Each of you should be honored that we are accepting you as students here.” He told us in a stern voice. “You will be the youngest students in our school at this time, and you will have a lot of catching up to do from the beginning. That is why you are here a week before the term begins. We will cut you no slack once the term begins. For the next week you will be drilled in all the things you would have learned since last August regarding how this school operates. Four upper classmen have graciously volunteered to cut their leave period short in order to help prepare you for the new term. You will show them your appreciation by following all their directions to the utmost of your abilities.” He went on like that for several minutes, with all the typical things one might expect about the history and honor of the school. Then he introduced us to the upper classmen, who seemed a little taken aback that three of us were as tall as they were, even though we were five years younger. After a short period of their attempting to establish their dominance with typical bluster, our parents were returned for a lunch served in the dining hall of the school. That was where we were introduced to General Robert Lingstrom, the Superintendent of the school. He was a retired three-star Army General, who listed as part of his resume having worked for ten years at the National Security Agency. That was what had made us go from merely liking the idea of this school to doing my best to make sure everyone signed on with going here. After lunch, our parents gave us all a teary-eyed farewell; at least they were teary eyed while we all sighed with relief to see the rental cars leave. Then the upper classmen descended on us and gave us their version of a military boot camp. I wasn’t sure which disturbed them more, the ease with which all of us handled the push-ups and sit-ups they kept on requiring, the fact that all of us had already perfectly memorized the “General Orders” that all cadets were expected to know, or the fact that later that night none of us were homesick or crying, wanting to go back home. Todd and Sean were the two of us least accepting of the military mindset. I had been in the military myself, albeit as a reserve JAG officer, and Davey took to it like a fish to water. Trevor and Brandon accepted it with mild enjoyment, and although they didn’t really like all of it, Sean and Todd both tolerated it overall. The only thing they really complained about was the haircuts. They did not like having their hair shorn off, but even that they tolerated although I heard quite a few grumbles from them. The only real mistake the school had made was in the room assignments. All cadets lived in a two-person room. Each cadet had his own bunk, locker, wardrobe, and desk. Normally the school assigned cadets to the room, but during the first semester several cadets had ‘dropped out’ of the school, and the cadets left without a roommate had been moved, so there were more than three rooms available. No one had made room assignments for us, and that first day we were led to three available rooms, ordered to select our rooms and stow away our gear. That was a BIG mistake, but one we were extremely happy about because we were three couples and had been worried about how to get the right people to be rooming together. Since they had warned us that whoever we roomed with would be our roommates all through the rest of school, unless one of us dropped out, we were all extremely happy to make sure we roomed with our partner. At least now we would not have to be sneaking between rooms every night. “I don’t know if I can do this, Brian.” Davey moaned halfway through the first week. We were re-folding all of our clothes, mostly uniforms the school had provided. Like the real military, they expected everything folded in a very precise manner, just like our ‘bunks’ had to be made with tight corners precisely at a forty-five degree angle. “Do what?” I asked him. “Make my bed every damn morning, and fold my clothes like this.” Davey sighed. “What about all the other stuff?” I asked him and he laughed. “That shit is easy.” Davey said while laughing. “This is the hard shit.” For a week, the upper classmen tried to run us through what they thought would be hell. They got us up at three in the morning, and kept us going until late at night. There was a lot of physical exercise, but also a lot of mental drills as well. Marching was a big part of every day since it was a big part of the school’s daily routine, and we were drilled constantly on things like every little fact about the school’s namesake, Civil War Union General John Cleveland Robinson. Sunday was a little different for four of us since we were not used to dealing with ‘chapel’ or church services, but it was a requirement that all cadets attend. Davey and Sean snickered at the rest of us over that little aspect. Soon enough the term started, and the real schoolwork began. It took a few weeks for our fellow first-year cadets to warm up to us. At first they were standoffish with us new guys, but the first inter-house game competition in February broke the ice. We beat the sophomore team at nearly every event, and a large part of that was thanks to the athleticism of Trevor, Brandon, Davey and myself. The actual schoolwork was a mixture of easy and difficult subjects. We had no problems in the regular History, English, Math, or various Foreign Language subjects, but the Military History and other military-centered classes proved challenging. By the time Spring Break rolled around, everyone had expressed that they were generally happier at the school than they had been back home in Modesto. Still, it was good for all of us to go home over Spring Break and spend time with our families. For a week, we barely saw each other as we spent time with our individual families, but near the end of the week, it was our families who brought all of us together for a barbecue at a local park. There were about fifty of us altogether, as various grandparents, including my own grandparents who were still alive in this time line, all gathered along with our immediate families. When we returned from a very relaxing, and fun, Spring Break, each of us was called into the Superintendent’s office for one-on-one meetings. Overall, the General was pleased with how we were fitting into the school, but apparently some of the instructors were concerned that portions of our school work were ‘too easy’ for us. He did not like the idea that we were not being ‘challenged’ to develop to our full potential, and wanted to have us be given in-depth assessments by his faculty. That suited all of us just fine, because while some of our courses were challenging, we all knew that most of it was far too easy, and none of us liked the idea of not learning as much as we could. I think part of that was because of the last few years of the last timeline, where we’d raced against the clock to end a situation that threatened the stability of the world in which we lived. We all felt some personal level of responsibility to keep something like that from happening again, and mentally at least, we were all adults. Sure, we still had fun like any other teenagers, and a great deal of sex in the privacy of our own rooms, but we had a purpose, a mission, and we wanted to succeed in that mission. Summer was a fun time for all of us. We were thirteen, and had finished what was effectively our ‘freshman’ year of high school two years early. During that summer we spent a lot of time camping, hiking, fishing (including several trips with Davey’s grandfather), and all the typical summer activities of teenagers. Occasionally we’d have arguments, and fight, but we’d get over it when our tempers calmed down and usually end up laughing over what we fought about. The ‘business’ being started by my family and Davey’s was actually doing quite well. Parts of the idea had come from Davey’s father’s business in the last timeline. David Jones Sr. was proving to be quite a good salesman as he took the idea to companies like Microsoft, which was just starting to rise as a major player, and established giants like IBM. According to their business model it would still be another year before things actually got off the ground, but already they were doing quite well even though they had not yet delivered any finished product. We all ended up going back to the Academy several weeks early for the start of the football training program. The Academy took football quite seriously, and there was quite a bit of grumbling when Trevor ended up on Varsity as second-string quarterback even though he was so young. Davey and I were good, but not quite good enough for the main squad, so we were on the J.V. team along with Brandon. Sean and Todd didn’t arrive until just before school started along with everyone else since they had no interest in playing on the team. Sean’s relationship with his parents was actually better off now than it had been in any other timeline. The distance from them and their not looking over his shoulder all the time was helpful and he actually expressed a grudging change in his desire to see his father meet a grisly fate. Sometimes, distance does make the heart grow fonder. Our term as “Second-Class Cadets” went a lot smoother than our first half-year. We were now accepted by our year-mates as part of their class, and although we only took about half our classes with them, we were no longer strangers. The academic work was much more challenging, largely because our ‘core’ classes were taught in special classes with just the six of us, or sometimes some smaller mix (we all had varying levels of skills in mathematics, so Davey and I ended up in classes with Fourth-Year cadets while the rest were in their own special classes). Trevor enjoyed the football season, even if he only got to play in three games, and only for a total of three quarters. Not everything was perfect. Halfway through the year, Sean ended up before a disciplinary review board for fighting with a Third-Year cadet. The cadet in question was a bully, and had been physically harassing the smaller Sean when Sean unleashed his full fury on the older student. The bully hadn’t stood a chance and ended up in the infirmary with a broken nose while Sean suffered a few bruises. The end result of the disciplinary hearing was that both of them were punished for fighting, but the upper classman received the harsher punishment and a warning that further incidents would result in his removal from school. A much more serious situation arose in the middle of the baseball season. Todd played with us on the team, as did Davey, Brandon, and Trevor. After practice one day, Todd and Trevor disappeared into a little-used shed near the baseball fields and were in the middle of oral sex when a Fourth-Year cadet walked in, finding them. He threatened them with revealing what he’d seen to the faculty if they didn’t ‘service’ him on demand, but was interrupted by the sounds of Davey and I calling out for our friends. Hastily he told them to meet him back there the next day or he’d tell. Naturally Todd and Trevor told us what had happened, and we concocted a plan to deal with the upper classman. I ended up talking with an upper classman on the team after practice, one who we all suspected was gay from the way he took slightly longer looks at everyone in the shower, and we just happened to be walking by the shed as Trevor and Todd were pretty much pushed into the shed by Jason Howell, the cadet who was trying to blackmail them. “Oh no.” Bill Lindstrom, the Fourth-Year I was talking with growled. “What?” I asked. “Wasn’t that two of your friends with Howell?” He asked me. “Yeah.” I agreed, trying to hide my smile. “I can guarantee he’s up to no good.” Lindstrom stated and walked purposefully over to the shed, where we could hear an argument going on inside. “No, we won’t do it!” Trevor’s elevated voice was clearly audible. “I don’t care what you say to people, it’s your word against ours.” “You’ll damn well suck me off, you stupid cocksuckers!” Howell growled at them and Lindstrom got an angry look on his face as he threw the door open and stormed inside. Howell was standing there, his practice pants unbuttoned and half-hard cock flopped out while he stood facing Trevor and Todd. He turned around with a sneer on his face but blanched when he saw Lindstrom. “It’s not what it looks like! I caught these two…” “Stow it, Howell.” Lindstrom growled. “I covered for your ass when I caught you and that First-Year two years ago. Put that fucking thing back in your pants and I better never, ever hear of you harassing anyone again.” Howell stormed out, and I was amazed at our good fortune until Lindstrom turned back to my two friends who were smiling and he managed to give all three of us a glare. “Thank you.” Todd said quickly but was cut off by Lindstrom shaking his head. “Look, let me explain something to the lot of you, and you better sure as hell share it with your friends.” Lindstrom growled. “I know you six think you’re the hottest shit on this campus, but we’re not blind. It’s obvious as hell what you guys do with each other, but as long as you fucking keep it hidden, no one’s going to say anything. Guys like Howell, they’re just looking for a chance to fuck you guys over. You need to be more fucking careful where you do your shit, get it?” “Uh, yeah.” Trevor said with a slightly scared look on his face. “Um, thanks.” “Don’t fucking thank me.” Lindstrom growled. “Someone should have told you guys already. Just fucking tone it down and keep your shit private.” With that he turned and walked out. Later that night, we all had several long discussions and decided to try and tone things down a bit. We had been getting carried away, doing things in places where we could, and in this case, had been caught. After that, we kept it to our rooms, long after lights out for the most part, or managed to use each other as lookouts while the others had some fun. Christmas break of 1982 was fun, and 1983 rolled around without any big surprises for anyone. Davey was growing increasingly worried as the time frame got closer for when his father had started molesting his sister, but he’d done just about everything possible to forestall that from ever happening. He and his sister were a lot closer than they’d ever been before, and they actually corresponded by letter a lot during the school year. By the time summer rolled around, we were all ready for an extended break from the Academy, but Davey and I were a little unprepared for the changes the summer brought. First off, his family was moving in to a home just three doors down from my parents. Then, both of our fathers were gone most of the summer as their business began to take off, and they landed several major contracts with rental firms across the nation. They did take two weeks off towards the tale end of summer, and we were surprised by the trip to Europe. That was when we learned just how well the business was doing. Our families were on the verge of becoming millionaires, and were considering ‘going public’. This time around, there wasn’t likely going to be a need for us to win the lottery. Our families were going to handle that for us just fine. Our third year at the Academy went exceedingly well. In fact, it went way beyond our expectations. Academically, we were very challenged, and for the first time since coming back to this timeline, we all felt like we were being pushed to the full extent of our abilities. Our days were busy, and our nights were spent doing more studying than anything else. During the Spring semester of 1984, there was an elective course that we were allowed to take. The instructor was a retired analyst from the Soviet desk of the CIA. His course was “A History of the USSR and the Future of Communism.” One of the last assignments he gave us towards the end of the course was to write an essay, using full citation of at least eight sources, on what the future held for the Soviet Union. All six of us managed to independently write six essays on the fall of the Soviet Union. None of us collaborated, and although we used some of the same sources for citation, when we reviewed each other’s finished papers, they were different enough that it was obvious we’d each made our own efforts. While all of our conclusions were the same, each of us had reached them in slightly different ways that showed our different way of thinking. Two weeks before the end of the semester, and two weeks after we’d turned in the essays, we were all called into the Superintendent’s office. “Mr. Alstrom was very impressed with the papers each of you wrote.” The retired General said when we were all standing before him. “At first he suspected you’d helped each other with the papers, but after reviewing them he realized you had probably all discussed this topic with each other without having collaborated on what was to be an individual project. Is that correct?” “Yes, sir!” We all answered in unison. “That’s good, I’d hate to think of any of my cadets cheating.” He growled with a warning look at all of us. “Now, Mr. Alstrom was so impressed with your work, that he’s called a few of his friends. I know each of you are much younger than our normal Third-Year cadets, but that shouldn’t hamper your opportunities. When you graduate here after your fourth-year, you will be more than ready for whatever University you choose to attend. Mr. Alstrom has been good enough to cut through the red tape and get an offer extended for each of you to intern with his former employer over the summer. It won’t take up your entire summer, but will be for all but a few weeks. None of you are obligated to accept, but I would consider it a personal favor if as many of you as possible will accept. Young men your age rarely have an opportunity such as this. I won’t lie. Most of what you will be doing will be grunt work, delivering files, making coffee and the like, but you will still learn many things, even if none of you choose it as a career.” “I’ll accept, sir.” Davey said without hesitating. “My parents may not like it all that much, but Dad’s going to be pretty busy except for a few weeks towards the end of summer where he wants to go for another trip. As long as we don’t have to change that, things should work out.” “I’ll contact your parents to make the arrangements.” The General said with a nod and then he looked at me with a raised eyebrow. “Cadet Breckenridge, does this mean you will be going?” “Yes, sir, it does.” I said, and knew from the small smile and nod on his face that he damn well knew Davey and I were a couple, but said nothing. Maybe he thought it was ‘just a phase’, or didn’t even think about it at all, but he did know where one of us went, the other was not far behind. “Count us in too, sir.” Trevor said after sharing a few looks with Todd, whose eyes were bright at the idea of actually getting into the CIA building. “Good choice, gentlemen.” The General said with another short nod. “We might as well go too.” Sean said with a slight sigh. “Excellent.” The General said with a wider grin. “I’ll let Mr. Alstrom know all six of you have accepted. You can expect to receive further details over the next week. Dismissed.” The ‘further details’ amounted to a lot of documents about secrecy that we had to sign, and since we were minors, had to be signed by our parents. Most of what we did that summer really was grunt work. We delivered files, we made coffee, and similar things, but we also talked to several people whose job it was to analyze every bit of data collected about the Soviet Union. Most of them thought we were foolishly naïve children, but we laid some important seeds over the summer. That summer, Davey and I went with our families to West Germany, France, and Italy. It was odd, having traveled to a lot of these countries in other timelines, mostly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the European Union. The checkpoints at different borders that no longer existed after the mid-1990’s were a unique experience, especially after having spent most of the summer at the CIA. Our last year at the Academy was the toughest yet, with our instructors having spent most of the last few years learning our strengths and weaknesses. The school wasn’t really a big one, so they got to know all of their students fairly well, and they used that information mercilessly to challenge us in a variety of ways. In sports, Trevor was the starting quarterback, and even managed to attract the attention of a few college scouts, our faculty members had tipped off the scouts to this amazingly talented fifteen-year old who would be eligible for college next year. Nearly every week, we got at least two or three brochures for several top-notch universities and we began to discuss among ourselves what we would do for the future. That was why in late November of that year, after spending Thanksgiving at home with our families, we all met over at Trevor’s house the day before we were to fly back to school. His parents were both out, visiting some friends, and so we met in their dining room. We had all brought the tons of brochures and letters we’d received from various universities, colleges, and from various other institutions offering scholarships. “First off, I think we need to make a final decision on what to do about our dear friend, the mad scientist.” Sean said with a sarcastic drawl after we were all settled in at the table. “We can plant evidence that points to him working with the Soviets.” I offered. In the last timeline they had been hesitant to kill people, and even though they’d been on board for removal after coming back, offering this way out might be a better option for them. “He can’t invent time travel if he’s in jail for the rest of his life.” “Not good enough.” Sean disagreed with a shake of his head. “He can still do the mathematics, and we all know that with enough money anything is possible. Guys, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. None of you know the man the way I do. He’s obsessed with this, and nothing short of death will stop him. The only way I can see that we guarantee he and Shevardnadze do not meet up would be to make sure he is dead.” “Or Shevardnadze.” Davey added grimly as he nodded his head in agreement. “Of course, we won’t be able to get near Shevardnadze.” “No, which is why the man who first invented time travel is the one who has to die.” Sean said, taking back the discussion. “I think I know just how to do it too. A story in the news last year gave me a good idea. One of the things that bugged me about the guy is that he smokes like a chimney. There were a few times I had to go over to his house first thing in the morning. He’s had the same house since the 1960’s, this little two-bedroom thing built during the depression. The place stank like you wouldn’t believe, and the first thing he did when he got up every morning was to light up a cigarette even before he was out of bed.” “So?” Trevor asked with a confused look. “We know he doesn’t die of cancer.” “No, but he does have a gas stove.” Sean said grimly. “If we got in there, turned off the pilot light at night, made sure all the windows were closed, and left a burner on, he’d blow up when he had his morning smoke.” Davey said with a little grin on his face. “That’s a lot of if’s, there Sean.” “He has bad allergies some times.” Sean said with a shrug. “Part of the reason why the place stank so bad was that he never opens the windows to air it out. It’ll work. I know it.” “If it doesn’t, we can work on a fallback plan.” I offered. Everyone looked uncomfortable, but no one objected. “Now, which of us will do it, and when? We should make sure whoever goes has a good alibi just in case.” “What about his neighbors?” Todd asked with a frown. “Won’t we be risking hurting them too if his house just blows up?” “His nearest neighbor is several hundred yards away.” Sean said with a shrug. “They’ll be fine. And I’ll do it. I know the house. I’ve been in there in the other timeline.” “Won’t he hear you breaking in?” Trevor asked. “I’ve been thinking about this.” Sean said with a grin. “In the nineties, he always kept a spare key under the back door. I bet it’s there in this timeline too. He likes to make his assistants go get things that he might have left at home so he just leaves a spare key where they can find it easily. I’ll wait until he goes to bed, maybe an hour after that, and then I’ll go in, blow out the pilot light and leave the burner on. He’s always making tea in a kettle, so I’ll put the kettle over the burner, make it look like he’d left it on and didn’t realize it or something. That should be enough to throw any possible suspicion off it being foul play.” “What if you’re seen?” Brandon asked. “I don’t want you going to jail.” “I can do it without being seen.” Sean said confidently. “Besides, you guys will be my alibi, right?” “Yeah.” Davey said thoughtfully. “How about we do this over Spring Break? We’ve got that camping trip planned. All of us are planning to go to the DMV together and get our licenses right? And then we’ve already told our families we’re going camping for three days. That’ll give Sean one day to watch the place, and then another to actually do it.” “I’m going with him.” Brandon said fiercely and no one objected. “We’ll be able to give you both good alibis, especially if we go up on a back trail for most of the day.” Trevor added. “Okay, sounds like that’s settled. What’s next?” “College.” I said and everyone looked around nervously for a moment. “Look, I have to wonder if we’ve all been thinking along similar lines.” Trevor said after the silence had almost become uncomfortable. “Don’t get me wrong, I love all you guys. The thing is, we’ve been together, living together, working together, in each other’s pockets for damn near ten years now over two timelines. I’d like to be out on my own for a while, at least the four years it’ll take to finish up an undergraduate degree.” “What about me?” Todd asked with a mock pout and Trevor smiled while Brandon and Sean chuckled. “You know I don’t mean you in that.” Trevor said softly. “I’d just like it to be you and me for a bit, you know. Focus on us more, instead of the group.” “I’d like that too.” Todd agreed. “So would I.” Davey added as he looked at me. “No offense guys.” “It sounds like we’ve been thinking along the same lines.” Brandon chuckled. “So, what school have you picked, Trevor?” “USC.” Trevor said. “They offered me a football scholarship, and they’ve got that film program Todd’s been interested in since the last timeline. Brian, you always said you could work that into your plans.” “I can.” I agreed. “Good.” Todd said with a determined look. “What about you guys, Brandon and Sean?” “MIT, full-ride scholarships for both of us.” Sean said proudly as he held up two letters that he and Brandon had brought. “I’ve got engineering. It’ll be a nice change from Physics now that I don’t have to babysit that bastard again.” “Computer science for me.” Brandon added with a slight shrug. “This time I can get a proper education in the subject.” “Sorry about that.” I said quietly and he chuckled. “Wasn’t your fault, Bri.” Brandon stated. “They just didn’t have a halfway decent program.” “What about you two?” Sean asked with a slightly worried look. “You said you went to Stanford in your first timeline. You going to go there again?” “No.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “He went there so that I could pitch on the baseball team.” “Now there’s a joke.” Trevor chuckled as everyone else laughed. “Davey Jones pitching!” “Shut up.” Davey said defensively. Sure, he could throw a ball halfway decently after years and years of practice with us, but he was nowhere near being pitcher-quality in an amateur league, much less college ball. “We’re going to Whitman College.” I said to cut off the teasing Davey was getting. Everyone looked confused. “I’ve never heard of it.” Brandon stated. “It’s a CIA school.” Davey said. “Well, it’s a school with a program specific for the CIA.” “I thought you were staying away from the CIA after our little internship?” Brandon said to me with a confused look. “He’s doing it because I want to do it.” Davey said. “I like it. I want to do it.” “Which is why we’re going there.” I stated firmly. “But what about the long-range plans?” Trevor asked with a confused expression. “We abandoning them?” “No.” Davey said with a sigh. “I’ll have a couple years in by the mid-nineties, and Brian and I can go back to school, get our Masters degrees and then go over to State. It’s not like the mafia, really.” “If you think you can pull that off.” Brandon said with a shake of his head. “Well, I guess that was pretty easy to do.” “Yeah, but don’t worry, we won’t lose touch with each other.” I assured them. “We’ve been through too much for that.” “No fucking shit.” Davey snorted, and we all laughed together before Trevor’s parents got home. Chapter 23 When we graduated from the Robinson Academy, we were part of a graduating class of sixty-three. All sixty-three graduates of the Academy went on to college, something not quite unusual for that school, but unusual in most public schools. Fourteen of those graduates went on to one of the four military Academies. Five (including Sean and Brandon) went to MIT. Most went to Ivy League schools like Yale or Harvard. Davey and I were the only two going to a little school in the heavily wooded area of Washington State where Whitman was located. Or rather, where we had planned to attend when we graduated. “This is weird.” Davey said as we unpacked our bags in the dorm room, two weeks before school started. “Yes, it is.” I agreed with him. We were both halfway through our sixteenth year, and freshmen about to begin our first year in college. “Did you see the house?” Davey asked me and I nodded. The dorm room was one of those on the top floor of the building, providing a spectacular view of the surrounding area. Well, it would be spectacular if you were the least bit interested. At least the dorm room we had been assigned was just the two of us instead of one of the bigger rooms. We had gotten here about an hour ago, and after doing our check-in were almost unpacked. “I did.” I said after taking a deep breath and letting it out as a sigh. I had not realized until I’d seen it how much I’d loved that house. “This is going to suck.” Davey said as he finished connecting the last connection on his computer and he sat down to boot it up. He had gotten his buzz cut freshened up back in Modesto before we’d left for college. We were supposed to let our hair grow out a bit more, but he’d complained about it itching too much and decided to see if he could get away with one more haircut before the fall semester started. “You want me to remind you it’s your fault?” I said in a tight voice and he actually laughed sharply before shaking his head. “Would it help if I said I was sorry?” He said as he turned around in his chair and gave me a pouting look. “Oh stop that.” I said with irritation and he smiled, knowing I’d already forgiven him. Damn it, what were they thinking? We were only sixteen! “Don’t worry, it’s not like we’re really sixteen.” He said after seeing the expression on my face. I gave another sigh, and nodded my head in agreement. Instead of arguing further I went over and hugged him, giving him a kiss on the top of the head. “I’m going to go for a walk.” I said gently and he nodded as his computer finished booting up and he turned back around. He’d already hooked up the phone line to the 4,800 baud modem and would be making sure everything worked just fine. Shutting the door behind me I went out and took the elevator down to the first floor. With a nod for the sleepy student at the front desk I left the building, barely wincing as the heat hit me like a wall. I’d survived Arizona before, and while I wasn’t happy to be back here instead of nice, cool Washington, it wasn’t going to kill me. We were here early, and except for some athletes, most of the campus was still fairly empty as I walked around the familiar environs of Arizona State. To be honest, I was feeling a little lonely without Trevor, Brandon, Sean, and Todd around. We had made other friends at Robinson, but the six of us had been a fairly insular group for all those years. Now it was just Davey and me here at this school. Both Sean and Brandon had been remote ever since Spring Break, when the two of them had left our campsite for the mission in Livermore. They’d returned very quiet, and had barely spoken a word the rest of the weekend except to say that they were successful. We’d all been quiet for the rest of the week with the realization that we’d all contributed to the killing of another human being, who had not yet done anything. Trevor had confirmed it for us, by speaking with his father when we returned. Trevor had brought up a story in talking with his father about how a student at the Academy had been caught smoking in his room. His father had shaken his head, and commented that smoking was stupid and dangerous. One of his co-workers at the lab had died just a few days before when his pilot light had gone out during the night, and the man had woken up and lit a cigarette. That was all the confirmation we’d needed, and towards the end of summer we’d all breathed a sigh of relief when we’d not heard anything more or any whisper that the death had raised suspicions. After making a circuit of the central part of the campus, I made my way up, past the dormitories and by the stadium. Memories of Trevor playing football there came to the forefront of my mind, and I shook my head while a half-smile flitted onto my face. As much as I wanted to be mad at Davey for getting us into this… situation, I could not really blame him. The Davey Jones I had first met in my original timeline had over a century of experiences behind him, and he’d done just about everything he’d ever dreamed of doing, except maybe making it into space. When I came back in time, I’d known that there would be a lot of challenges, and one of those would be that the Davey Jones I was meeting would not have had those experiences. Davey had told me, in the original timeline, that he’d craved adventure and excitement when he was younger. That had led him into many interesting experiences. In my first trip back in time, Davey had been patient, but after Sean had come back he’d gotten a taste of being involved with ‘the big picture’ in a direct way, and I knew that deep down part of him craved something similar in this timeline. That was why I’d pushed him and my friends to the Robinson Academy. I’d hoped it’s ‘military’ elements would keep him satisfied, but they’d just fed his hunger for something more, and so now here we were, involved with America’s spy agency. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I hoped it wouldn’t have too many effects on the long-range plans for the future. It shouldn’t, but as I’d already learned, the future wasn’t written and even the most prepared or experienced time traveler could run into the unexpected. “You’re back!” Davey said when I came back to our dorm room. He got out of the chair in front of the computer and crossed over to hug me as soon as I’d closed the door behind me. “You smell good.” I said as I caught the scent of the cologne he was wearing. “You’re sweaty, and you smell good too.” Davey said in a familiar, husky tone. Even as I leaned forward a bit more to kiss him comfortably, I could feel him hardening in his jeans. By the time we were done, we were both sweaty, and feeling very good as we laid together on one of the narrow dorm beds. It was a good thing we had four years of practice sleeping together in small beds at the Academy. “I like it when you greet me like that.” I said as I ran a finger along his side. He shivered slightly at the touch. “So you forgive me for getting you into this?” He asked in a very soft tone. “Yes.” I said without hesitation. “Sorry, you know how I get when plans get changed.” “You and your plans.” Davey said with a slight chuckle. It was probably his biggest frustration with me. I didn’t react well when my plans were de-railed or sidetracked. “I’ll get over it like I always do.” I said as I reached around discovered to my joy that he was ready for another round. He sighed as my hand began to stroke him gently. “I love it when you do that.” He said quietly, and it was another hour before we were walking down the hallway to the showers. Two football players were in there, and greeted us with nods before heading out. That night we ate at a restaurant on Mill Avenue before heading to the theater where we watched a movie both of us had already seen in another timeline. Then we headed back to the dorm room. We could have easily afforded the house, or other off-campus living quarters, but our ‘handler’ at the CIA wanted us to live on-campus. Thus we were going to get the ‘full’ experience on campus this year. We were even being encouraged to pledge a frat if the opportunity arose. Davey seemed to like the idea, and if he wanted it, I’d go along with him. “Brian, I’m excited.” Davey said later that night as we lay together in one of the two beds. “Excited?” I asked. “Yeah, excited.” Davey said with a sigh. “Sorry, it’s just, you know, I’ve got this feeling like anything can happen. I know you put a lot of time and effort into your plans, and they’re good plans, but I feel like right now anything can happen and that excites me. Part of me feels like we’re going to be getting to go to school for real now, unlike last time. With all the others around, last time felt like just an extension of high school, but now it’s just us and that’s exciting.” “I understand.” I told him gently and he snuggled up tighter against me. His breathing became regular as he drifted off to sleep, and I was falling asleep soon after. The next morning we had our interview with Professor Lee. He looked no different than he had in the last timeline, and we spent a good hour sitting in his office talking in nothing but Russian. That had been one of our courses for the last four years, giving us both a good reason for being proficient in the language. After we were done, he had signed off on putting us in the advanced-level language courses. With that mission accomplished, we headed back downtown to the coffee shop that we’d enjoyed with our friends in the last timeline. Then, our families showed up in the late afternoon, and we went out with all of them. Jenny was fourteen now, getting ready to start high school. Her parents had offered to send her to a boarding school, but she insisted on going to Downey. Last year, the company our parents started had gone public, and at least on paper they were now millionaires with their stock options. By and large, they hadn’t changed how they lived much, and even Davey’s mother was trying to live her life as if not much had changed, but they did enjoy a few things, like staying at the more expensive Biltmore Resort while in Phoenix, and going out to dinner at the more expensive restaurants in town. They stayed for three days before heading back, and Davey and I got down to business preparing for the upcoming semester. The truth is, I love school. I enjoy learning, even if it’s learning something over again. Each time is a little different, and the classes I had that first semester were all slightly different than those I’d had in the last timeline, and of course different than those I’d had at Stanford. Another thing I had discovered is that while some schools have a deserved reputation for excellence in education, the quality of any education, at any school depended on two primary factors: The desire, or motivation, of the teacher to actually teach and the desire of the student to learn. The finest teacher, with the finest materials, the best-prepared curricula and lessons plans, and the absolute finest in teaching aides is wasted if a student has no desire to learn. Likewise, the best-prepared, highly motivated, eager student is wasting his time if the teacher in front of him has no desire to really teach. Good textbooks, lab equipment, support staff, office hours, money for extra materials and other supporting mechanisms are important, but given two bare essentials: a good teacher and a good student, it is possible to achieve the best in education with little else. That was one of Arizona State’s greatest resources: their professors. For the most part, their professors were eager to teach, and knew their subjects very well. While at many other institutions of higher learning, research was the main goal of professors, here there was still a strong ethos of instructing amongst the professors. By carefully selecting certain professors, both Davey and I managed to construct a course schedule for the first year that kept us interested in our courses. We also developed friendships with several other students. By its very nature, the university’s foreign language programs tended to produce tight-knit groups of students. Studying a language effectively took more than going to class and doing the assigned homework. Watching movies in that language, reading literature in that language, and actually holding conversation in the language was necessary to move from a basic proficiency into actual competence. Many of the students we joined that year had been studying the language together for three years already, and while at first we were interlopers, they quickly grew to accept us as part of their group. Of those students, they were all in their early to mid-twenties, and so there was a slight age gap between us at first, especially when they would go out drinking on the weekends, but as the semester stretched on, it became less of a barrier. Davey and I went home to Modesto for Thanksgiving, and our families seemed to enjoy the tales we had to tell of life at ASU. Davey’s father practically beamed with pride at having his son go to that school. The man was not the same as the David Jones Sr. who had become President, but he was closer to that man than the one in the previous timeline. Davey was understandably proud of him. It was Davey’s mother who cast a little cloud over the holiday with a single comment. “Now that you boys are at a school with girls, have either of you started dating yet?” His mother asked us with a piercing look. My parents looked a little uncomfortable, having figured us out long ago, but his parents were still largely in the dark about the true nature of our relationship. “Mom!” Davey exclaimed with a slight blush. “The youngest girls at ASU are all eighteen or older! I’m jailbait to them!” “Oh.” His mother said with a worried frown. “What about girls from one of the high schools?” “I go to college.” Davey said with a shake of his head. “What mother is going to want her daughter dating a college student?” “That might be a problem.” His mother said with a shake of her head. “Don’t worry, son.” Davey’s father said with a smile. “In just over a year you’ll be eighteen. Plenty of time for that.” “Thanks dad.” Davey said with a shake of his head. His hair, like mine was growing out a bit, and we both needed at least a trim to keep our hair looking neat. We managed to hook up with our friends the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and we all spent most of the day up at Don Pedro Reservoir, sitting in a rented boat in the middle of the lake and talking about the last few months. None of us were extensive letter-writers, and e-mail was still a few years away as a means for us to communicate. Davey and I had a phone in our dorm room, but we were the only couple that had that luxury. So, we spent the day catching up with our friends. “We miss you guys.” Todd said about halfway through the day. “But, well, it’s like we’re learning how to make other friends at school. It’s kind of weird, like maybe that when we were all together we didn’t really need other people so we shut them out. Don’t take it the wrong way, but it’s nice making new friends again.” “It is.” Davey agreed. “Just don’t think we’re going to forget you guys, though.” “No, we’ll always be the best of friends.” Sean agreed while everyone nodded. When we returned to Arizona, almost everyone was focused on the upcoming finals. They were weeks away, and there were still parties every weekend that we both managed to attend. We had gotten invitations to pledge several frats on campus, but Davey had decided (wisely in my opinion) that he didn’t really want to be a ‘frat’. Both of us were certain we’d done well on our finals, and we left Arizona for the extended winter break. Unlike the last timeline, we weren’t taking Winter Session courses, and so we stayed in Modesto from late December all the way until the weekend before Spring Semester started. Our parents now had a big office in downtown Modesto, and we began to realize just how big their business was growing. Dad had mentioned they’d taken the company public a few months ago, but our Christmas presents included stock in their company. When we realized the stock we had been given was valued at nearly a million dollars for each of us, I was floored. This was far better than providing a winning lottery ticket had been. The one troubling point was Davey’s mother and grandmothers both throwing girls at him the entire time we were back in Modesto. He even went on two ‘dates’, and I’d commiserated with him over the awful time he’d had on the dates. Davey wanted to wait until he was eighteen though, before telling them the truth about our relationship. It would make dealing with any fallout from them easier. When school started up, it was proving to be a hectic semester. The other students in our Russian courses were by and large preparing to go to the Soviet Union for the summer. The university’s Russian language program had managed to once again obtain approval from both governments for a summer-length study program at Moscow State University. Many of the students from our classes would be spending the summer there. Davey and I were still too young, by a year, to go, but we knew that next year would be our year to take part in the program. That was why we’d been sent to ASU in the first place. By the end of the semester, we’d managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA, and fully establish ourselves as regular, if a little young, students at ASU. During the summer, Davey and I spent several weeks at an ‘intensive’ Slavic-language program being offered by Rutgers. Davey was in a staged ‘accident’ that resulted in him needing to have some plastic surgery. At first I didn’t like the way his nose had been changed, or the slightly different shape of his eyes, but the changes grew on me after a while. “Dude, I like the new nose.” Trevor said when we met up with him and Todd over the summer. Brandon and Sean were taking summer session courses at MIT, and we’d just missed them by two days. “Shut up.” Davey responded to Trevor sharply. He’d always been a little sensitive about his nose, and now that it was narrower, and no longer had that little ‘hump’ halfway down, I could see him staring at himself in the mirror a lot. His eyes were more almond-shaped now as well, but the changes were less immediately noticeable. “So, other than your face getting smashed up, everything else is alright after your car accident?” Todd asked in a slightly worried tone. “Yes, everything’s fine.” Davey assured our old friends. Not even they were to be told yet about the real reasons why the surgery had happened. For that matter, we didn’t even know the full story yet. Phoenix was still hot when we returned for the new semester. Sure, Modesto got hot during the summer months, but it never got quite as hot as Phoenix. Once again we got a good dorm room and went through the typical routine of unpacking and setting our room up for the next year. Within a few days we were settled in and ready to begin the next round of classes. Last year, we’d finished the highest level of undergraduate Russian language courses that were regularly offered, so this year we were given special upper-division classes where we studied under two professors. We also were assigned as ‘assistants’ to the beginning-level courses, and as the months wore on, found ourselves making a fairly lucrative business in tutoring some students. Most of the students we tutored were freshmen, and were usually only a year or two older than us. That led to a situation that had me very nervous, and caused one of the most serious arguments yet. Matt Stoler was a handsome young man, eighteen, and he kept looking at Davey in a way that made me very nervous. Worse yet, Davey responded to his smiles with smiles of his own, and the body language between the two of them was far more friendly than made me comfortable. “Brian, you worried about me and Todd when we first got together.” Davey said with a hint of scorn in his voice when I broached the topic. “After all these years I’d have thought you could learn to trust me by now.” “I do trust you.” I told him. “I don’t trust Matt.” “It takes two to tango, Brian.” Davey said in a warning tone. His statement worked both ways, really. He was telling me that nothing would happen because he wouldn’t let it, and he was telling me that it took both of us to make our relationship work, or to not work.” “You’re right.” I said with a sigh. “I’m sorry. It’s just that, well, you look so damn good I know you could have any guy you wanted…” “I only want you, Brian.” He said in a tone that made my heart melt. That night I was sure our neighbors heard what we were doing, but we didn’t really care. It was too much fun. It was the day before we left for Thanksgiving when something happened that affirmed my reasons for worrying. Davey was tutoring Matt in our dorm room while I was out supervising a make-up exam for Professor Lee. It was an oral exam, with the students having to recite several poems, and afterwards I spent an extra half-hour with two of them, helping them to fix their pronunciation of certain words. After I was done, I headed back to our dorm room, and was just opening the door when I heard the familiar sounds of two people kissing. There was Davey and Matt, whose back was to me, kissing on my bed! Instead of erupting and making a scene, I started to close the door with a sinking heart when Matt fell to the floor. With the door just open a crack, I couldn’t see much, but I could hear what was being said, and my heart started to climb back out of my feet. Matt was on the floor because Davey had pushed him there. “What do you think you’re doing?” Davey snarled angrily. “I… uh… I thought you were…” Matt stammered with real fright in his voice. “You thought what?” Davey snarled again. “I thought you were… you know… like me.” Matt stammered even more. “You know… gay.” “Yeah, I’m gay.” Davey stated with anger dripping off of every syllable. “What makes you think you can kiss me, though?” “I’m sorry.” Matt said softly. “I just thought if you were gay, you wouldn’t mind hooking up. I mean, everyone says you and Brian are both gay.” “We’re a couple.” Davey said firmly. “I’m not interested in anyone but him. If you knew that we were gay, what made you think I’d cheat on him?” “You’re a guy, aren’t you?” Matt shot back and Davey laughed. “Just because I’m a guy, don’t think that means I’ll cheat on someone I love.” Davey said around his laughter. “Brian and I have been together for longer than you’d believe, and I’m not about to risk my relationship with him, no matter how cute someone is.” “You think I’m cute?” Matt said in a pleased tone. “You’re easy enough on the eyes.” Davey said. “Brian’s better though.” “Oh.” Matt said softly. “I’m sorry I misunderstood.” “Just don’t try something like that again.” Davey said firmly, and I walked away from the room. When I came back an hour later, Davey smiled as I handed him a dozen red roses. “You heard, didn’t you?” Davey asked with a smile. “Yep.” I admitted with a slight blush. “What did you see?” Davey asked curiously. “I opened the door when he was kissing you.” I was blushing furiously now. “And you didn’t make a scene?” Davey asked with a tilt of his head. “I heard you push him to the floor, and stayed around to hear the rest of the conversation.” I admitted, looking at the floor. “So you know you can trust me, don’t you?” Davey said softly, but there was an edge to his voice. “Yes, and I’m sorry I ever doubted you.” I said softly. “You were right though, too, about what he was after.” Davey gave me that much. “Thanks for the roses.” “They’re not half as beautiful as you.” I said, and that got me a very deep, passionate kiss. It was the day after Thanksgiving when Trevor’s father called Davey and invited us to his house that evening. Davey and I were both a little confused when we arrived and found that Trevor and Mrs. Rush were both gone, and two men were waiting with Mr. Rush. We recognized one of them as the ‘handler’ we’d been working with from the CIA. “Mr. Breckenridge, Mr. Jones, this is Walter Ameson, my supervisor.” Richard Long, the handler introduced us to the older man with white hair. “I was surprised when Mr. Long called me and said he needed my help.” Mr. Rush said as we all sat back down. “It has been some years since I had contact with the Agency. I was more surprised when I found out you two boys were involved with them. You have not gotten Trevor involved in whatever this is, have you?” “No, sir.” Davey said cautiously while Long nodded. “What’s going on?” “You two young men have expressed an interest in working with the Agency while you were still in High School.” Ameson explained. “I believe you both remember your summer internships. Your group of friends and you had some strange ideas, but they are starting to appear not to be as far-fetched as we first assumed. Unfortunately, our operations are not geared towards obtaining the kind of information we would need to verify some of the theories that are now being kicked around by our analysts. That is where you come in, Mr. Jones.” “Me?” Davey asked with surprise. “Yes, you.” Mr. Long added. “You’ve been very good about doing what we ask without demanding an explanation. Now, your patience is about to pay off.” “We were quite nervous when Mr. Long brought up this idea, especially since it centered on such a young person.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “Still, you appear to be quite an unusual young man, very mature, and we are going to take this risk.” “What risk?” Davey asked cautiously. “Davey, you were born here in Modesto, right?” Mr. Rush asked. “Yes, at Modesto City Hospital.” Davey stated. “Trevor was born at the same hospital.” Mr. Rush stated. “It was six weeks after you, as you know.” “Yes.” Davey murmured. “My wife and I were at the hospital the same night you were born.” Mr. Rush said and Davey’s eyebrows rose. “In fact, I think I remember seeing your mother brought in to the Labor and Delivery area. She was quite…vocal about wanting you out of her.” “I can imagine.” Davey said with a slightly stunned look on his face. I was surprised too, since this was the first I’d heard of it in three timelines. Trevor’s parents had been there the night Davey was born? “Do you not wonder why we were at the hospital?” Mr. Rush asked and Davey nodded. “You see, my sister was pregnant at almost the same time as my wife. They were only a month apart.” “I’ve never met your sister.” Davey said quietly. “She died in childbirth.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “I’m sorry.” Davey said immediately and Mr. Rush shrugged it off. “She went into labor three weeks early.” Mr. Rush said sadly. “She didn’t know it, but she was bearing twins. Something went wrong inside of her, and she went into labor prematurely. The first boy was delivered without too much trouble, but the second had gotten the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck during the birth process. The hospital was a mess that night with your mother and three other women, all giving birth at the same time. The twins were fraternal, not identical. You do understand the difference?” “Fraternal are from different eggs inseminated at the same time instead of one egg that splits into two separate embryos.” Davey said automatically. “Yes.” Mr. Rush continued. “The second twin died before he could be delivered by emergency cesarean section. My sister also died later that night.” “I’m very sorry.” Davey said quietly. “What happened to the one that survived?” “He was returned to his father.” Mr. Rush frowned. “I am still sorry about that.” Mr. Ameson said to Mr. Rush. “He found out about the delivery and there was nothing we could do to prevent it when he made the demand.” “What does…” Davey began to ask, mostly to cover the fact we already knew Mr. Rush was a defector. In this timeline we were not supposed to know that. “I was not born in the United States.” Mr. Rush said, in Russian. Davey and I both managed to put appropriate expressions of surprise on our faces. “Sereosna?” Davey asked in Russian, the word for ‘seriously’. “Pravda.” Mr. Ameson replied with a slight smile. Simply put, he was saying it was ‘truth’. “My wife and I came to the United States because we did not want our child born under communism.” Mr. Rush continued in English. Then he told the story we’d heard before, except this time we found out that his sister had come with him. From the expression on his face, I could understand why that had never been mentioned before. It seemed the memory was very painful for him, and it explained why he had very rarely spoken of it in any of the timelines. His sister had been a secretary for a mid-level bureaucrat in the Foreign Affairs office. She had helped them arrange their defection, and gone with them. The father of her unborn children was an older man, who would now be in his early sixties, and had not had any children by his wife. After the mother had died in childbirth, he had demanded his son be returned to him, and legally there had been no way to stop him short of creating an international incident. “The boy, Dmitry Verakov, died about a year ago in an auto accident while vacationing in Eastern Europe.” Mr. Ameson continued the story after Mr. Rush fell silent. He took out a picture from a briefcase next to his chair and showed it to us. Several things fell into place at once. “You want to use Davey to get close to this man.” I said while Davey stared at the picture. The young guy in the picture was handsome, and he looked a lot like Davey, in fact, with the changes to Davey’s appearance, I’d have very few doubts they were brothers. “Did the other twin really die?” Davey asked in quiet voice, and Mr. Long chuckled. “Are you thinking maybe you were adopted?” He asked Davey with a very amused expression. “This guy looks a lot like me.” Davey said, pointing at the picture. “Not only that, he has the same blood type as you.” Mr. Ameson added. “Although, if a genetic test were to be done, you’d find that you do not really share his genetics. It is just a fortuitous resemblance, and the fact that your blood type is the same is an even bigger stroke of luck.” “So I’m not really…” Davey’s voice drifted off. “No, you are no relation to Mikhail Markovich Verakov, although when he sees you we believe that he will suspect a great deal.” Mr. Ameson stated. “A check of your blood type will prove that you could be his son, and that will likely be enough for him. He is currently a high-level assistant to the Politburo member responsible for overseeing domestic production of consumer goods in the Soviet Union. As such, he has access to much of the economic data that we have failed to acquire.” “You want me to get him to defect?” Davey asked. “If it’s possible.” Ameson stated. “If not, wiggle your way into his life, his home, and learn as much as you can. Pass that information to Mr. Breckenridge, who will bring it back to the United States. Make Verakov believe that you are his lost son. His wife died two years ago, and his son last year. He is a very lonely man right now.” “And the whole idea is just plain insane.” Davey said with disbelief. “What makes you think I can do this?” “Please, Mr. Jones, you’re quite capable of hiding secrets.” Mr. Long said with a snort. “It took us until two months ago to verify that you and Mr. Breckenridge are homosexuals in a long-term relationship. We still have not been able to find out when that relationship started. Three FBI agents doing background checks on you both failed to uncover that information.” “Matt.” Davey said flatly and Mr. Long grinned. “He didn’t know who he was doing it for, just that he was being paid to see if he could seduce you.” Ameson said with a shake of his head. “That is why we are including Mr. Breckenridge in this. We assume you will not wish to go without him.” “Aren’t you worried that Verakov will find out and get mad?” Davey asked. “When it comes to the children of powerful men like him, the Soviet Union will often turn a blind eye.” Ameson stated. “Well, that or they’ll seek to use it as a hammer hanging over his head if he steps out of line. No, both of you should be quite safe when they find out about your relationship.” “You make it sound like it is for certain.” I stated. “Yes, Mr. Breckenridge.” Long said with a grin. “Both of your files will indicate that you were rejected for service with the Agency because of your sexual preference. It is the policy of the United States that homosexuals are not to be trusted.” “But you trust us.” I stated with a raised eyebrow. “Call me an enlightened individual.” Long said with a shrug. “You both are very unique individuals.” Ameson added. “We would not normally even think of such a hairbrained scheme as this, but you are both fairly mature, obviously able to keep secrets without looking like you’re keeping secrets, and have shown yourselves to be dependable. If you accept this plan, this will be the last time we officially meet. The two of you will apply for the Study Abroad program that is scheduled for next summer. You will both be eighteen by then, and legal adults.” “While you are there, you will be invited to attend several events.” Long continued. “At least one of those will be attended by comrade Verakov. He often gets sent in the place of his boss. Make sure that you meet him, and if possible speak to him. Let him take things from there. Mr. Jones, you will use Mr. Breckenridge to pass any information learned out of the Soviet Union. We suggest that if an offer for you to stay with comrade Verakov is made, that you accept. Mr. Breckenridge should be able to pass back and forth between the United States and the Soviet Union every few months.” “Mr. Breckenridge, you will pass your information along through Mr. Rush.” Ameson took up the explanation. “We suggest you write nothing down, nor take any incriminating photographs. Both of you have shown that your memory is near-perfect. That is the safest way for you to pass information to each other. Mr. Rush can put it in written form, and send the reports in through his regular channels.” “You will both be paid for your work, if this succeeds.” Long finished. “We will protect your identities by listing you as being denied for service, but Mr. Rush will receive a significant raise in his living allowance that we pay him. When this is over, I believe you both trust him enough to pay you appropriately.” “We trust him.” Davey didn’t hesitate to reply but he got a worried look on his face. “How long am I supposed to do this for?” “Until Mr. Verakov dies, retires, or the Soviet Union ceases to exist.” Ameson stated and Davey looked at me with a worried expression. “Brian?” “It’s up to you.” I told him. “You’re the one who wanted to get involved with the bloody Agency.” “I… you know… I… uh… I can’t do this. Sorry.” Davey stammered after a moment. “Why not?” Ameson asked with a frown. “I… Brian doesn’t really want to be involved in this cloak and dagger stuff and I won’t drag him along.” Davey said. “You’re right, we are a couple, and we’d have to do this together or not at all.” “Thank you, Davey.” I said quietly, putting a hand on his shoulder and not caring about the other men in the room. “But you know you want to do this, don’t you?” “Yes, but…” Davey protested. “We’ll do it.” I said to Ameson who nodded, although he was obviously trying not to look at my hand on Davey’s shoulder. “Why?” Long said. “It’ll help our country, and Davey really wants to do it.” I said with a shrug. “I like spoiling him.” “I love you.” Davey breathed out in a whisper, and he was smiling from ear to ear. Chapter 24 It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.”",

      "content": "“They would not be interested in the likes of me.” Verakov said with a snort. “I know nothing of military secrets. My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.” “They would not be interested in the likes of me.” Verakov said with a snort. “I know nothing of military secrets. My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. Chapter 25 “I do not think you understand the importance of being able to dream of a better life.” Davey said to his ‘father’ as we rode in the car back into Moscow. For the past week we’d stayed in the dacha while the old man took the time ‘off’ from work. Not that he did no work. He had an office in the dacha, and spent many hours on the phone when he was not entertaining the two of us. It had now been a few days more than three weeks since that first trip out to the dacha, and we were now heading back into Moscow for the official ‘results’ of the test. Davey and I were both nervous, since we couldn’t see how the CIA would have been able to fake those results. “You do not understand the importance of knowing your place in life, and being assured that you will have safety and security when you are old and infirm.” Verakov countered Davey’s assertion. “What good are silken dreams when they do not put food on your table or a roof over your head?” “What good is a roof over your head when you know your children will never achieve more than you have?” Davey retorted. This particular argument had been raging for two days now, and both of them were enjoying it immensely. If I had to be honest, I was enjoying it too. “In America you can have both.” I added my voice to the argument, drawing looks from both of them. There were smiles on both their faces. The truth was I liked Verakov, probably more than I liked this timeline’s version of Davey’s father. “Social security guarantees the elderly will have money in their retirement, although they do not have to depend on that alone. They can save, have their own pensions to supplement what they get from the state. If they are smart enough to purchase their own home while they are working, they will have paid it off by the time they retire, and are even more free to enjoy the fruits of a life of labor.” “But you have millions of homeless.” Verakov pounced with a wolfish smile. “Millions of your elderly, and your mentally ill roam your streets and sleep in doorways while trying to stay warm! Your Social Security does not save them!” “There is no homelessness in the Soviet Union?” Davey shot back. “None worth mentioning.” Verakov snorted. “Again, I ask what use are there dreams of yours when you can not feed your hungry or shelter your homeless?” “How much grain is being imported this year from the United States?” I asked and the man blinked at me before laughing. “No system is perfect, but we are getting there.” He countered with a slight shrug. It was true the Soviet Union imported grain every year from the United States. Their collective farming system was…inefficient in the extreme. They should have been able to grow enough food to feed their own people, but they didn’t. In some cases, it wasn’t the collectives that were the problem though. Some grew more than enough food, but that food rotted in storage because there were no trucks to take it where it was needed. It was facts like these that had ultimately led to the fall of the Soviet Union, and while we might argue about them with Verakov, we didn’t want them to change anytime soon. In less than six months, the beginning of the end would happen for the Soviet Union with the first elections in Hungary and Poland. Then the Berlin Wall would fall, and within two years of that, the Soviet Union would cease to exist. An idea was beginning to form in my head, an avenue of opportunity that had never been available to us before, but was now opening. One of the things my original Davey had always tried to change was the fallout of the Soviet collapse. He had achieved some success with that in my original timeline. Sean had told me that I had been less successful in the last timeline. Maybe, just maybe, this opportunity here with Verakov could be translated into better success down the road. “Not even the United States is perfect.” Davey admitted with a shrug of his own and Verakov nodded. “Too many people are too blinded by their patriotism to see the need for improvement in their own system of government.” Verakov stated flatly. “Maybe they fear being arrested here.” I added in as a jibe and Verakov frowned at me. “For some that is a concern, but not for those who belong to the Party and seek to further the goals of the Party.” Verakov’s voice was flat as he spoke. “To look at the Party with a critical eye, seeking to improve the dialectic is the responsibility of all Party members. We are here.” “Amazing.” Davey said as we got out of the car and looked around at the Kremlin. We had been to Red Square when we first arrived, and seen the Tomb of Lenin with its long line of tourists, but to actually be in front of the working Kremlin, where the Soviet Union, and later the Russian Federation were governed was absolutely amazing. “Do you actually work here?” “No, my offices are nearby, not in the Kremlin itself.” Verakov said kindly. “Come, you have your papers?” “Da.” Davey said as he pulled the green passbook from his suit pocket. We were both wearing our best suits today. Davey’s passbook was new, something given to him just last week by Verakov. I had received a similar one. Neither were our American passports. These were documents that actually allowed us more freedom in Moscow than most of its own citizens enjoyed. A middle-aged officer looked them over carefully before allowing us entry into the building itself. Walking through the building was different than walking through the Capitol in Washington, or even the White House. Those buildings were full of history, and you knew they were the center of power for a mighty government, but the Kremlin had even more history, and at times like now, just as much power. It was more ostentatious, and in a way more humbling. We were led to a room deep in the Kremlin, where Verakov introduced us to Yuri Maslyukov, his ‘superior’. I recognized his name as the head of the State Planning Committee, and was surprised because I had been led to believe that Verakov worked for a different branch of the government. The State Planning Committee was responsible for implementing the long-range economic plans of the Soviet Union, and was one of their most important economic bodies. “They are waiting for the two of you.” Maslyukov stated after polite words had been exchanged, and Verakov led Davey into another room while I remained, as it was clearly intended with Maslyukov. When they were gone, the man turned to me, looking me over twice before speaking again. “Walk with me.” “Yes, comrade.” I said with a slight nod as he led the way out of the room and back down the hallway of the Kremlin. “In that room, a doctor and an official from the Foreign Office are telling your friend and mine that the young man is indeed the lost twin son.” Maslyukov said in Russian after we had turned a corner. He stopped walking and gave me a very direct look. “It is of course, a lie.” “Excuse me?” I exclaimed in English and he nodded before starting to walk again. I had to hurry a few steps to catch up. “Why are they telling them this if it is a lie?” “Mika has worked hard for the Rodina all of his life.” Maslyukov stated in a matter-of-fact tone. “The Rodina likes to repay those who serve it, and the last few years have not been kind to him. For the last year, his work has not been as it should, and I was considering replacing him. It was only a few months ago that I took this position, and we have important work to accomplish. I need him, his knowledge, and his skills, but only if he is able to work hard. Your… friend has given new life to him. Mika believes the boy is his son, and his work the last few weeks has never been better.” “Then why are you telling me the truth?” I asked him with incredulity. So the CIA hadn’t been able to fake the test. But… how did they get this result? Or did they just expect it to happen and hope for the best? My incredulity was real right now. “You are both very smart young men.” Maslyukov began his explanation with a compliment. “The fact that the two of you are perverts would normally be a barrier, but in this case we will overlook this fact.” “Why?” I asked directly and got a direct answer. “Mika, with his new son at hand, will do valuable work for several more years before he retires.” Maslyukov’s answer was simple. “When he retires, you can tell your friend the truth, and the two of you can return to your country, or stay. If you stay, honorable work will be found for the both of you, and as long as you do not make your perversion public, we will overlook it and not punish you as the law requires. In staying, at least until Mika retires, you will live comfortably and have the gratitude of the Soviet people.” “Aren’t you worried we might be spies?” I asked him, just to see his response. “Nyet.” He snorted in the negative. “You are too young, although we do know you wished to work for the CIA but were rejected. Mika has already told you we know this.” “I don’t want to give up my American citizenship.” I stated flatly. “I do not think Davey will either. I do know I will want to be able to visit my family from time to time.” “All that is being arranged.” Malsyukov stated. “You will both be granted diplomatic passports. The American State Department does not wish an international incident, although they deny any switch in babies was ever made.” “They’re right.” I reminded him and he chuckled. “But we will never tell them that.” He replied. “Sergei Mikhailovich, as your friend is being told his real name should be, will be granted Soviet citizenship. You will be a legal resident of the Soviet Union. Tomorrow you will visit the American Ambassador and tell him that these arrangements are acceptable to you. Both of you will be granted visas to return to the United States for a few weeks each year, and naturally any foreign vacations you take with Mika will be permitted. When Mika is retired, you will tell your friend, but not before! Then you may decide whether to stay, or leave forever.” “Why are you doing this?” I asked him sharply, and with a deliberately suspicious tone. “You believe the Soviet Union is this gigantic creature that does not care about its people.” Maslyukov stated flatly. “You are wrong. You Americans claim your government, what is the phrase? Oh yes, ‘Of the people, by the people, for the people’ but it is not the people your government serves, it is your economy. We run our economy so that it serves the needs of our people, not some corporations or a select few. Spend the next few years learning the true Soviet Union, not the villain your propaganda has shown you. We truly care for our people, and Mika has served us long and faithfully. In some ways, we have failed him. Our doctors failed to cure his wife of cancer, but then even your doctors often fail with that. Americans die all the time in accidents like that which took the life of Dmitry Mikhailovich. The difference is that we will give him something to replace those losses.” “By lying to him.” I stated and he chuckled again. I realized that we were essentially walking in a big circle as we passed the doorway that led to the room where Davey was right now. “Some lies are not wrong.” Malsyukov shrugged. “Some lies can do more good than harm. Do you not lie to your parents about your relationship with Sergei Mikhailovich?” “My parents know.” I said with a shrug. “His do not.” It was a statement, not a question. Yes, Davey had told Verakov that. “No, they don’t.” I stated. “Why not?” Maslyukov asked. “They wouldn’t understand it.” I said sourly. “So for you two, telling the lie to them is okay?” He asked with another chuckle. “When is a lie acceptable to you and when is it not?” “We’ll be lying to them when we tell them this story is true.” I stated and he nodded. “It will hurt them a lot.” “Will they not hurt when they learn their son will never give them grandchildren?” Maslyukov retaliated, and I had to smile at his persistence. He was right of course. Everyone lied, and we always believed our reasons for lying were valid, even necessary. “I am not Russian, or Soviet, or Communist.” I said with a shrug. “Why should I care to help you maintain your form of government?” “Ah, a real question at last.” Malsyukov said. “We will give you and your friend a comfortable life, more comfortable than you would have in the United States even.” “I don’t care about that.” I said with a shake of my head. “You are not interested in money?” He asked with a raised eyebrow. “Are you sure you are American?” “We can have all that in the United States.” I answered. “Then what if I were to tell you that you and Sergei Mikhailovich have broken Soviet law?” He said in a sterner voice. “You can be sent to the gulag for five years for the things you have done in the bedroom of Mika’s dacha. Not even your State Department would seek to stop such a sentence.” “You will lose Verakov’s services if you do that.” I retorted. “We will lose him anyway, to depression, if you do not cooperate.” He countered. That should be enough protesting to make it look real. “Okay.” I said after meeting his stare for several minutes. “As I said before, you are a smart young man.” Malsyukov said more jovially, clapping me on the shoulder. “Now, why don’t you join your friend and his father? Remember, he must believe what he has been told.” “I won’t tell him the truth, not until Verakov retires.” I said firmly and the man nodded once before opening the door for me. Davey was sitting in the room, in a chair next to Verakov, but smiled and leapt to his feet when he saw me. “Brian, it’s true!” He said in a tone of disbelief, but there was a smile on his face. “Can you believe it?” “I don’t know what to believe.” I answered in Russian. “This sounds like some story out of a Tom Clancy novel.” “Pravda.” Davey agreed with a chuckle. Verakov also stood and turned to face me. “Let me introduce you to my son, Sergei Mikhailovich.” Verakov said with a hand on Davey’s shoulder. “That is the name we would have given him if he had come to us, as he should have, eighteen years ago.” “I understand.” I said calmly. “What happens now?” “I don’t know.” Davey said with a frown. “How am I going to tell Mom and Dad? And Jenny? Do we stay here?” “I would like to get to know my son, if you are willing.” Verakov said firmly. “Both of you will always be welcome in my home.” “The Soviet Union will welcome one of its own sons home, and his friend.” The older man who was in the room said gravely. “I am Yuri Andreiich Nerov, from Foreign Affairs. We have already spoken with the American State Department. I believe you have been told of the agreements made, if this remains quiet and out of the Western media?” “Yes.” I agreed. “What do you think, Brian?” Davey asked me in English. “He says we can attend Moscow State for our degrees, if we wish. We’ll even have an apartment near campus, together! They will honor our credits from Arizona State.” “I’ll do whatever you want.” I said simply. “You should get to know him better if he really is your father.” “I think… it’s not like we won’t be able to go back.” Davey said. “I just don’t look forward to telling Mom and Dad.” “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” I replied in English and he nodded. “Come, this calls for a celebration.” Nerov said as he walked over to a low credenza with several bottles on it. He poured Vodka of course, and we all toasted father and son. Two nights later we were at the U.S. Embassy in a rather uncomfortable situation. At first two mid-level State Department officials grilled us over and over again on what was really going on, and on our decision to stay in the USSR. Then the ambassador himself got us alone in his office and pulled out the big guns. The long-distance telephone call to Davey’s parents, and then my parents, was anything but comfortable. They wanted us home, especially Davey’s parents who didn’t understand why he wouldn’t believe that they knew he was their son. This whole situation was stressful to them, and Davey knew through our secret tapping system that the test results were really a lie. Fooling his parents wasn’t easy, and it was only the promise of a visit over Christmas that kept them from going to the media immediately. Verakov took us to the Black Sea resort that was the favorite of members of the Politburo and their senior staff. Whatever his humble beginnings, Uncle Mikhail, as he insisted I call him, was one of the elite of Soviet society now, and lived a fairly comfortable life. Even while relaxing on the beaches of the Black Sea, though, he was working and Davey and I learned a lot about his work just from overheard conversations. We learned even more from the philosophical conversations that Davey had with the man while we settled into life in his dacha. The man was intent on convincing Davey that communism was the right way to govern a society, and Davey was proving a capable debater. He deftly steered their discussions into areas where the man actually revealed quite a bit about economic production in the Soviet Union, and the problems they faced. Occasionally I would get involved in the conversations, but I tended to give ground easier than Davey did. When classes began again at Moscow State, we were enrolled the same as any other students, or at least any other students of the elite. The required courses on Marxism-Leninism were non-negotiable, as were the math requirements harsher than their American counterparts. Davey was chagrined to learn he would be taking more math than he would have at Arizona State. Then there was the fact that everyone now called him Sergei. Even I called him by that name, only using his real name when we were having sex. It took him two weeks into the semester until he answered to it as he would to his real name. My name was also ‘russianized’, with people taking to calling me Yuri for some reason. I never quite got the connection, but Davey insisted that if he had to go by Sergei, I would answer to Yuri. When December rolled around, we learned just how cold a Russian winter could be. Both of us were happy to get on the Aeroflot flight that would eventually take us back to California. It was a long flight, with a stopover in Japan before we landed in San Francisco where both of our parents met us. His folks whisked him away with barely a word for me, while my mother kept on touching me to make sure I was really there. “What is really going on, Brian?” Dad asked when we were in the car and driving back towards Modesto. Davey had called, and written his parents every week, just as I had done, and their responses had become more and more distressful as time went by. Mikhail Verakov had not been happy to let us go, but seemed confident we would return. “You were told about Davey’s birth.” I answered in English that was actually a bit rusty. “Don’t tell me you believe that story?” Mom snorted. “Does it matter if we do or not?” I asked. “The Russians do, and Verakov believes it. You know how bad the story would make our government look if it ever got out. It’s just easier to let things happen this way. It’s not like they’re going to make Davey live there forever.” “What do you mean?” Dad asked. “And that’s Davey. Why are you staying?” “Would you leave Mom?” I asked him with a snort and he shook his head. “As for what I mean, well, when Davey and I graduate from college, things will change. Verakov will have gotten to know Davey for a few years, and he’ll be less… needy is the word I think. He’s just asked Davey for a few years to get to know him. He’s lost all his family you know.” “That doesn’t mean he has a right to take other people’s family.” Mom said sternly. I could only imagine what Davey was getting. “Well, both you and Davey have appointments with psychologists who specialize in dealing with Stockholm Syndrome. We’ll get you set right.” “You think we were taken hostage?” I asked, surprised by my own parents. “What other explanation is there?” Mom said and I laughed. This was going to be fun. In the end, it was Trevor’s father who took both parents aside for several long conversations. When he was done with them, our parents gave us dirty looks, but didn’t protest when we packed our bags to return to Moscow. Davey’s parents were downright frosty to both of us, not even taking him to the airport. It was on the flight back I learned that they finally knew exactly what our relationship was, and they’d threatened him with being disowned if he didn’t dump me. Then they blamed my parents for the whole mess, and I wasn’t sure how that was going to affect the business they all operated as a group. Mika was happy to see Davey when we landed in Moscow. It was even colder than it had been when we left. Oddly, Davey looked more comfortable here than he had the entire time in California. This whole thing was going to take years to smooth over when everything was done. I’d left nearly two hundred pages of hastily typed notes for Mr. Rush before we left, and I hoped whatever information was in there was worth the cost Davey, and to a less extent, I, would be paying for this – emotional as well as physical. Twice over the next year, I met Alexei Shevardnadze. It was eerie standing in the same room with the person who had caused so much trouble in previous timelines. The scientist was dead, though, and there was no need to kill the Russian this time. Still, it was interesting to know that I could have done it if it was necessary. As 1989 progressed, the discussions between Mika and Davey became less and less frequent. If you read Pravda, or watched the government news, you might not know that Hungary and Poland had elected non-communist governments. Nor would you truly understand that the Berlin Wall no longer existed. Still, news of those events percolated on the campus of Moscow State, and on the streets of the city itself. Knowing what was coming, and seeing the effects of those events on the populace was interesting. The signs were everywhere of the cracks in the foundations of the Soviet Union if you knew what to look for, but its leadership went along like nothing had changed. That year I went home for two weeks in the summer, and had several long talks with Mr. Rush, as well as leaving him a two-hundred page book on everything Davey and I were observing. In those notes were predictions that within the next few years, major changes would be seen in Soviet government. They didn’t come right out and say the Soviet Union was going to crack like an egg, but they hinted at it. That summer, we went to Samarra with Mika, and Davey got to meet several ‘cousins’ that still lived in the region. It was a closed region, where few if any Westerners had ever visited, and when I went back for Christmas, again alone, Mr. Rush seemed quite enthralled with my notes from the visit there. 1990 was going to be a long year for the Soviet Union, and I had front-row seats with Davey for the excitement. The 1988 reforms of Gorbachev, allowing for the first time since 1922 private property, private ownership of business and manufacturing plants were starting to have their effect on the national economy. Mika was at the heart of the storm, and while we stayed in the Moscow apartment that had been provided, we barely saw him during the week. On the weekends he looked like he was aging every week, growing older and older. Davey took to worrying over his health more than anything else. One thing I’d always underestimated was the news programs. As time went by, the reforms of Gorbachev relaxed the Communist party control over the media. For the first time, the Soviet people were learning some of the sordid history of their nation. From Stalin’s purges to the abysmally high suicide rate, information that had been kept from them was becoming public, and shaking the faith of the average citizen on the street. Since the early days of the cold war, the United States had tried telling Soviet citizens about these atrocities and problems, but their broadcasts reached few people inside the nation, and were believed by even fewer. Several of those we met who were near our age group could sing every song by American (and British) rock bands that they heard over the pirate American broadcasts, but would laugh about stories of Stalin’s atrocities, until they heard about it on Moscow news. By the time we were ready to graduate with our degrees from Moscow State, I was quite certain that I wanted to stay and watch this all the way through. It was still winter outside, and there was a lot of snow on the ground when we went to a dinner at Mika’s house. Maslyukov was there, with his wife, as were several other apparatchiks who worked with the two men. It was a semi-formal affair, but the discussion took a surprising turn after the dinner itself was over, and we sat in a room sipping cognac in front of the fire. “Do you know what our work is right now?” Maslyukov asked Davey and I after taking a puff on his cigarette. So far Davey and I had both resisted taking up smoking, which all these men did with relish. “I have a few thoughts.” Davey admitted. “There is much privatization of businesses going on now and you play some role in that.” “We are supposed to be supporting the private ownership of business and manufacturing while still maintaining control.” Maslyukov stated sourly. “It does not go well. Production is still down, and our economy worsens instead of improves.” “Maybe you have the wrong people buying the businesses.” Davey said quickly, hitting a key point I’d shared with him about the problems of post-Soviet Russia. “What do you mean?” Maslyukov asked. “Who is buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “Those with the resources to do so, Sergei.” Mika stated with a chuckle. “You know this already, or should.” “Yes, but why are they buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “What is their motivation for owning them?” “To make money.” Maslyukov, a true communist said it with a frown. “That is the problem. They do not care about the good of the nation, they care first about making more money.” “That is always the problem with capitalism, but it does work.” Davey said. “The problem is not just with production, it’s with distribution, which is still state-controlled, and it is with the ownership. Here in Moscow, the small restaurants and other types of businesses that are opening are flourishing. That is because they can buy the goods they need to sell, and because they live here. They care about not only making a profit, but doing right by their neighbors who are their customers. A person in Moscow who buys a factory in Samarra does not care about the people in Samarra. He cares about his factory making money.” “So how do you solve this?” Maslyukov asked with real interest. “No one in Samarra has money to buy the factory.” “No one.” Davey said with emphasis on the second word. “Establish a fund to help the workers in the factory take out a loan and collectively buy the factory. If the workers of the factory own it, depend on it for their lives, and receive back the fruits of their labor from dividend payments, they will work harder. They will vote to hire managers that know what they are doing, and get rid of those who do not.” “But that does not solve the transportation problems.” I added. “What good does it do to make more automobiles if you cannot move them to where people can afford to buy them?” “How would you improve our transportation, my young man American friend?” Maslyukov asked. Should I reply honestly, and take the risk of actually helping the Soviet Union? No, the suggestion would only speed up its end, or be a contributing factor to that end. “Much the same way as what Sergei suggested.” I explained. “Truck drivers do not care if they arrive on time if they are not being rewarded for their work. Enable them to achieve their own control over their own work. Establish a fund that will loan them the money to buy their own trucks. You won’t really be spending any more money than you already did to buy the truck the first time. You are just moving money around on paper. Charge them a little interest. They will own the truck, and be able to offer their services to those who have goods to move at a fair price. Monitor their prices, and those that cheat too much can be punished. In English we call it ‘gouging’. “But there isn’t really infrastructure to support all that.” Davey said with a sigh. “The roads are awful, and fueling stations are not all that common. They would have to be privatized too in order to make this work.” “That is the problem.” I agreed with him. “You cannot just turn one part of the economy into private business without also converting those that support such businesses. A puzzle is only little pieces until you put them all together to form a whole.” “Yes, it is as you have said, Mika.” Maslyukov said. “Looking at only one tree has blinded us to the whole forest.” “It is something we should think about.” Mika added, and the conversation changed to the weather and when we thought spring would finally arrive. By summer, Davey and I found ourselves in positions I had not expected: working as assistants to Mika. Certainly we were very junior, and watched very, very closely, but we found some of our suggestions actually being considered, and one or two implemented. I was certain they would not help strengthen the Soviet Union, but held my breath just the same. That summer Davey did not go back to America at all. His family was still not speaking to him, and my parents explained that David Jones Sr. had quit working for their budding corporation, even though he still owned a fair amount of stock. It wasn’t quite clear what he was doing, but he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. Mr. Rush was not alone when I went to visit him this time. Mr. Long was there as well, and I had a direct debriefing that summer that lasted almost all of the two weeks. I barely had time to spend a day with Trevor and Todd as well as Brandon and Sean, all of whom were busy with their own lives. Todd was working on movie sets, trying to become a director. Trevor was drafted by L.A. and playing professional football as a backup quarterback. Brandon and Sean were starting up their own computer firm and had settled in Massachusetts. Before I returned, there was one more meeting with Mr. Long, who told me to keep doing what we were doing. There were several people at the CIA who now believed it was entirely possible the Soviet Union could collapse any day now, and they were looking forward to seeing it become reality. He was even more excited about our new jobs, and was considering setting up a system whereby we could sneak information out more frequently. Davey was happy to see me when I returned, and he had a very worried look on his face as he met me at Moscow’s airport. “What’s wrong?” I asked him, switching back to Russian easily now. “It’s father.” Davey said with a frown as we walked to the waiting car. He had started calling Mika that last year. Never any shorter name, always ‘father’. “What is it?” I asked him. “He is in the hospital.” Davey said sadly. “The doctors say it is only a matter of time.” “I’m sorry.” I said as we got in the car. “Are we going to see him?” “Yes, he’s been asking for you.” Davey said with a slight smile. “He misses his ‘third’ son.” “I missed him too.” I said, and was only partly surprised at the truth of that statement. Chapter 26 We buried Mikhail Verakov twelve days after I returned to Moscow. Like so many other Russian men, he died from lung cancer and pneumonia. Over the last few years, I had seen the close bond that had developed between Davey and this man, and so I wasn’t surprised at how hard Davey took the man’s death. Mika was not Davey’s real father, and Davey knew that, but he loved the man anyway for a variety of reasons. Part of it had to do with the unconditional love that Mika had always given him. Even at its best, Davey’s relationships with his parents had always been conditioned by a variety of factors. They had certain expectations of him in every timeline, and he was constantly struggling with them in one way or another, even when they accepted him, and our relationship. He had to prove to them that he wasn’t a disappointment even though he was gay. With Mika, there had been none of that. The old man had accepted Davey, or Sergei as he’d always called Davey, as Davey was, without condition. Davey did not have to do anything to please the man, or to be loved by the man. All he had to do was be there. It was certainly a far easier relationship for Davey. Davey spoke at the funeral, which was attended by a lot more people than we had expected. It wasn’t a religious service of course, and many of the people were dignitaries of the Soviet government. After the funeral, we even spoke a few words with the Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev. That was quite an eye-opening experience for both of us since we had rarely even seen the man before and certainly never spoken to him directly. Davey and I didn’t speak about the future after the funeral, but rather I comforted him while he cried. I’d been there with him in my original timeline after his parents had each passed away, and knew he took these types of situations very hard. The future could wait while he grieved. We spent that night at Mika’s dacha out in the foothills instead of at our apartment. There, on the mantle over the fireplace, new pictures had been added in recent years, pictures of Mika and Davey, and even a few of me up there as well. In all of them, Mika’s lips were curled upwards. “You have a visitor, Sergei.” Lina, Mika’s older housekeeper said on the morning of the third day. Mika’s driver was no longer around, but she was still here, taking care of the house and helping to fix our meals while we stayed. She was a widower, and her children were grown and had families of their own now. Her work here had been a semi-retirement for her, and I idly wondered what would happen for her now. For that matter, what would happen with this house? “Who is it?” Davey asked in a soft voice. “Comrade Maslyukov is here.” She responded. “Please, bring him in.” Davey said quickly, turning from the picture on the fireplace and straightening his shirt. We were both wearing dark slacks, and Davey was in a white dress shirt while I was wearing a light green polo. Both of us straightened our hair a bit before heading down the stairs. “Comrade Maslyukov, welcome.” Davey said formally as we came into the living room. “Comrade Verakov, you have my condolences.” Maslyukov said with a short nod to Davey before he turned to me. “Comrade Breckenridge, you have honored our agreement over the last few years. I am here to honor my part now.” “You are referring to the fact that Comrade Verakov was not really my father.” Davey said calmly and Maslyukov shot me an accusing glare. “Please, Comrade, I knew from the beginning that he was not. Yuri did not have to tell me anything. I think in the end, even he knew that I was not his other son, but it did not matter. Family is more than blood, sometimes. Mika needed family, and he was a good man who deserved to have a family. I was honored to give him that.” “Interesting.” Maslyukov said as he sat down hard. Davey nodded and crossed to the small bar, pouring three shots of vodka and handing one to me before giving one to the older man. We toasted the memory of the departed and Maslyukov downed his quickly. “I liked him the first time I met him, and knew he was a good man.” Davey continued his explanation calmly. “He seemed so lonely, and did not deserve that. When I saw how he was able to accept me as I am, without judgment, I knew I would give him what he wanted: a son.” “This is a copy of his will.” Maslyukov said after he had digested Davey’s words. He took out a folded paper from his suit coat and handed it to Davey. “You will see that he has left you all of his possession. They are not as much as your American father has, but you can live comfortably in the USSR with this.” “Are we still welcome here?” Davey asked. “It is a fiction that I am a son of the Soviet Union.” “It is fiction, yes, but the records all say now that it is a fact.” Maslyukov shrugged. “If you wish to stay, if both of you wish to stay, you will be welcome. I am worried for the future.” “Why?” I asked, speaking for the first time in this conversation. Maslyukov held out the tumbler he had emptied, and waited while Davey filled it for him. The older man downed it again and looked out the large windows behind us and motioned for both Davey and I to sit. We did, sitting next to each other on the couch. “I fear the Union is crumbling.” Maslyukov’s voice was faint. When both Davey and I looked nervous he chuckled. “The listening devices were removed last year. Neither of you have said, or done, anything that our spies have disapproved. They were quite upset that you were not spies.” “There were no military secrets for us to steal.” Davey shrugged and Maslyukov chuckled again. “It is possible the American government has been looking in the wrong places for our secrets all these years.” Maslyukov stated in a sad tone. “I never thought to see the day when the Union would be crumbling. The Germans talk of reunification with the capitalist brothers. The European states talk of independence, and even the Baltic states are grumbling that they were once sovereign. I fear that only tanks and soldiers will keep them in the Union, and this is not the 1950’s. Gorbachev is not Kruschev, to crush them under his boots and force them to comply. As things stand now, the Union will not survive more than five years.” “I would give it two at most.” I said, taking a risk. Maslyukov gave me a hard look and then nodded abruptly. “That is a bet I will not take.” He grumbled. “You have proven to be quite intelligent, both of you.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Sergei, I fear for what comes.” Maslyukov stated. “I wonder what will happen to the Rodina if the Union dissolves. Will we become capitalists only concerned about making more rubles and discard our principles?” “That is a possibility.” Davey said with a frown. “Mika and I had many conversations about the dangers of unfettered capitalism. I do not agree with communism, I believe you know that.” “Yes.” Maslyukov agreed. “Mika said you might make a socialist, but never a communist.” “True.” Davey agreed bluntly. “Even socialism though, does not work, in my belief. It is more accurate to say I believe in controlled capitalism. A field where any man may achieve his dreams, but all have the chance to play the game.” “Yes, Mika told me of this.” Maslyukov said with a shake of his head. “That is why I would ask you two to stay. You will never rise to a position like mine, or even that of Mika, but I would listen to your ideas as we struggle to keep the Union alive. Can you stomach that, even though you were born American?” “What if the Union does not survive?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow. “What then?” “Then, you will help build a new Rodina.” Maslyukov said with a shrug. Before coming to Moscow, I’d have never expected to hear a Russian say something like this. Davey and I hadn’t spoken about the future, but he obviously had been thinking about it, and reached some decisions. I knew him, and could reason out what his thinking might be without having to talk it out. He knew I was always worried about the days after the fall of the Soviet Union. As Sean had said, my plans for trying to help from the outside had failed. Maybe working from the inside would see a different result. The long range plans would be affected of course, but they had been centered on more than just the United States. They were not about setting up a third political party in the United States, or getting any one individual elected. No, the plans were about changing how people looked at the world, and about the role of government and the individual. It was about taking responsibility for ourselves as individuals, and as a society. “I am willing to stay.” I said after we had all remained silent for a long time. Davey nodded, and Maslyukov nodded. “Then I will see the two of you in my office next Monday.” Maslyukov as he stood up and prepared to leave. “We have much work to do.” He wasn’t lying, either. There was a lot of work to do. Over the next few weeks, and months, we butted head with several different factors. First of course, was that this was still the Soviet Union, and its bureaucracy was filled with loyal communists. Gorbachev said he wanted private ownership, but those who had to implement such things considered private ownership anathema. Then there was corruption. Corruption had always been a part of the bureaucracy. To one extent or another, it was always a factor no matter the form of government. That was why, in the United States, anti-corruption laws were so important. One of the reasons America’s form of government worked was because corruption was limited, kept under relative control. The fact that every year there was at least one corrupt lawmaker getting caught was a testament to how well the system worked, not necessarily to its failure. Failure was when corruption happened and was never caught. In the more authoritarian USSR, corruption was far more rampant. Those in authority had more power, and in many cases investigators were either hamstrung in their ability to root it out, or had no interest. Blatant corruption of course was dealt with, and every so often the government would trot out an excessively corrupt bureaucrat as an example, but few of those in power feared being hauled off to prison. The changing rules on property and business ownership meant that more and more people were seeing opportunities to make a quick ruble, and many of them lacked any sense of ethics. We were still outsiders for the most part, and while they called us ‘Sergei’ and ‘Yuri’, and we all spoke mostly Russian, those we worked with and for rarely forgot that we were not really Russian. It was a barrier for us, but not an insurmountable one. Davey’s relationship with his family back in the States continued unchanged. They didn’t speak to him, and he didn’t speak to them. My parents told me that Mr. Jones had patched up his relationship with them, and gone back to work at the company that Dad still ran. When I visited them towards the end of Spring, they questioned me intently on why I was staying in the USSR. At Mr. Rush’s house, Mr. Long was waiting expectantly for me. I had another long series of reports for him, and he was most interested in hearing about Maslyukov’s statement regarding the USSR crumbling. He explained how he was filtering our reports through several different channels, making it almost impossible to track down where they came from, which was a good thing because I knew of at least one spy that was operating within the CIA at this time. I could have warned him about that person, but I had not come up with a way to explain how I knew about that person, while not creating the expectation that I would know of other things. Davey and I continued a comfortable existence in Moscow by and large. Occasionally, some woman from work would express an interest in one of us, but would look somewhere else when we showed no interest. At night, we would occasionally go out with groups of co-workers, or Russian friends from University. Both of us enjoyed the many theaters in Moscow. Not the movie theaters, but the stage plays, ballets, and even the opera, although Davey didn’t like operas nearly as much as I did. Back in March of 1990, Gorbachev had sent tanks into Lithuania to prop up the communist government. Later in that same year, Latvia and Estonia began the process of declaring their independence, and the tanks did not roll in to stop them. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, we watched along with the rest of the world as the United States rallied together an impressive coalition to throw Iraq out of that small country. When the battle began in early 1991, our friends in Moscow reacted with shock at the total collapse of Saddam’s largely Soviet-supplied and trained military. While the world was occupied watching what was happening in the Middle East, the KGB and Soviet Army troops again took to the streets in Lithuania. Their nationalist media was going further than the other states in pushing for independence. Maslyukov remained tight-lipped about the meetings of the Central Committee, but we could tell they were growing more and more intense and fractured. There were days that Davey and I held our breaths, or had to bite our tongues to keep from revealing too much knowledge of what was right around the corner. While US troops mopped up operations in Iraq and Kuwait, the Soviet Union voted. Davey was technically a citizen, and actually got to take part in the vote. It was in March of 1991 that nearly eighty percent of Soviet citizens voted to keep the Soviet Union, albeit in a reformed manner. Most of the ‘breakaway’ states didn’t want to lose access to the larger Russian markets that full independence would bring. What they wanted was less central-control from Moscow, and more local control. Maslyukov breathed a sigh of relief that his Soviet Union had passed a major crisis and survived. I didn’t tell him what was right around the corner. Boris Yeltsin was running for the office of President of the Russian SFSR against Nikolai Ryzhkov. Mikhail Gorbachev was supporting Ryzhkov, but we both knew it was Yeltsin that would win, and in a few months stand up to the tanks of the Soviet Union. Davey and I, still using our system of tapping out messages just in case there was someone listening, discussed whether we should get involved in the campaign or not. In the end we went to Maslyukov with the matter. “Why do you want to support Yeltsin?” Maslyukov asked. Just a few years ago, elections like these, where you had several different candidates, and only one of them a member of the Communist Party would not have been possible. “I believe he will win.” Davey answered. “Yes, but why do you want to support him?” Maslyukov pushed and Davey looked at him with a confused expression for a moment. “This is not America, Sergei. Supporting the wrong candidate here is much more dangerous, especially for one who works for the Soviet Union. No, don’t get that look on your face my young friend. This is no longer the old Soviet Union. Lefortovo will not be graced with your presence just for supporting Yeltsin. Still, I might be told that your work is no longer needed here, and I will find it hard to disagree.” “We will miss working for you, comrade.” Davey said quietly, but firmly. “There are other jobs in Moscow, though.” “Especially if you helped with the right campaign.” Maslyukov nodded and then he sighed. “We will have to keep in contact.” “Of course.” Davey said with a smile. With that we left the office, and returned to work for the afternoon. That night we went home to the large townhouse that we had purchased, partly with money from Davey’s inheritance, and partly through selling some of the stocks we had received via our parents. It was one of those old eighteenth-century homes, with huge rooms, carved borders, and tall, narrow doors. Lina had dinner ready, as usual, when we got home. She had accepted our offer to live with us after Mika had died. She was now retired, receiving her pension from the state, but stayed with us for free, as well as received a small stipend to supplement her income. In return, she cooked dinner for us, and did most of the basic cleaning. Here she was close enough to her adult children that she could visit them, and her grandchildren nearly every day. It was a good arrangement that worked for all of us. The timeline was moving along so smoothly, heading straight in the direction that we expected, and even I had to admit that being where we were, at the center of change in Russia and the collapse of the Soviet Union was a breathtaking experience. Moscow was flooded with more foreigners than ever before, many of them ‘consultants’ brought in to help with the reforms of Gorbachev. It was amusing watching them struggle with the Soviet bureaucrats, so stuck in their ways, and yet knowing that change was on the horizon. Davey and I were both welcomed into the Yeltsin camp with open arms and many shots of vodka. Both of us were quite surprised that on our first day we got to sit down with Boris Yeltsin himself for nearly thirty minutes, talking about his vision of the future. Neither of us was surprised by his continued dedication to communism. The collapse of communism was by and large an accident of fate more than anything else. In order to understand how it happened, it is necessary to understand how the ordinary Russian perceived leadership. Maybe it was because of the repeated Mongol invasions, followed by Hitler’s greatest mistake of World War II where he invaded and devastated Russia before being thrown back, but the average Russian prefers strong leadership. Ideas and concepts such as communism or democracy, or feeding the poor, or even justice often take a second seat in who a Russian will support compared to the ‘strength’ of the candidate. Will the candidate be strong? Will they be able to lead Russia (or the Soviet Union) against all enemies? This theory of Russian electioneering was originally something I’d learned from the first Davey I had met. However, it had been proven over several lifetimes. The Soviet Union collapsed, according to this theory, not because of a failure of communism so much as a failure of leadership. Gorbachev took a fatal blow in public opinion when his own deputies managed to seize control from him. His deputies who took over failed to garner enough support from the public, and from the military. Yeltsin was able to seize the initiative, and because both Gorbachev and the coup plotters were pro-communist, the only alternative was to do away with the crumbling system. The only winners in that showdown were Yeltsin and his supporters, and Yeltsin won because he was seen showing strength and being victorious. Years later, when Putin took the reins of power from an ailing Yeltsin, it was his strength that allowed him to stay in power long after he should have left the position. His strength gave his viewpoints an air of legitimacy, and so he stayed in power. No one could muster the appearance of strength for many years in order to challenge him. Working on the election was an invigorating experience for both of us. It was different from American elections, but at the same time there were some core fundamentals that were unchanged. Controlling the message of the campaign was just as important, if not more important in these elections, and that was where I found my niche in working with Yeltsin’s senior advisors. Davey’s gift for writing found him working with the speechwriters for Yeltsin’s addresses, and after his victory (which was unsurprising for us), we found ourselves in middle-level positions of the administration of the Russian state government. It wasn’t too difficult for us to obtain visas for our friends to come out and visit us the week before the coup we expected to happen. Trevor was the most difficult to arrange, mostly because his parents were defectors, but even he was able to obtain a visa in this age of perestroika. They arrived on a British Airways flight in Moscow’s main airport, and Davey and I were there to meet them. The changes in our friends over the past several years were shocking to us in many ways. We had kept in touch by letters, and the occasional phone call, but seeing them after all these years was different. Trevor’s brown hair was cut short, and he was in great physical shape. Todd’s hair was longer, and paler red than it had been years ago. Brandon’s hair was longer, nearly touching his shoulders, and he was slimmer than I had expected. Sean’s hair was darker, and his freckles had started to fade, but he was actually more built up than Brandon. “Look at you two.” Trevor said with a smile after we had all hugged in the middle of the airport’s concourse after they had passed through customs without too much trouble. “What?” Davey asked in English. “You look… Russian.” Trevor said, also in English. He alone of our friends had any fluency in Russian. “We have been here for a few years.” I replied with a slight smile, and found it odd to be speaking English after using Russian almost exclusively all these years. Actually, I’d used English on my visits home, but speaking it here, in Moscow, felt truly odd. “Let’s get out of here.” “You’re going to love our house.” Davey promised them as we made our way out and found two taxis that would take us to the house. Davey rode in a car with Trevor and Todd while I went with Brandon and Sean in the other taxi. “Wow, it’s nicer than I thought.” Sean said as we drove down the road. “Moscow is very beautiful, especially in the summer.” I replied to his statement and heard a grunt from the driver. He was trying to take us the longer way to our destination and I spoke to him briefly in Russian. The driver frowned, but nodded and turned back to the shorter path. “Are we really going to the ballet tomorrow night?” Brandon asked with a slight grin on his face. “Yes.” I assured him. “That will be fun.” Sean agreed. The chatter continued like that, with no references to the real reason for their visit. I played the good tour guide, pointing out important historical sights along the way to the house, and when we reached it, I paid the driver off with a very slight tip since he’d tried to cheat us. “Can we talk freely here?” Trevor asked in English once we’d gotten inside the house and were all sitting in the living room. Lina was visiting her grandchildren today, and so we had the house to ourselves. “Yes.” Davey assured them. “Why’d you want us here?” Brandon asked with a frown. “Not that it’s not good to see you guys again. I mean, we haven’t gotten together at all in years, so why now?” “You know the coup is about to happen.” Davey said with a frown. “We thought you’d want to see it in person.” “Well, kind of.” Trevor shrugged. “But, what does this all have to do with our long-range plans? Why are you two here instead of in the U.S.?” “I think I overlooked something important in those plans.” I said with a sigh and looked up to see their expressions of surprise. “What would that be?” Sean asked with a little half-smile. “I’ve made the typical mistake of American hubris.” I said with a shrug. “In the planning, I looked at things too much from a solely American perspective, always at changing things from the outside, not the inside of other nations. Look, this has always been about changing the perspective of people so that they look at the world from a larger perspective. How do we think we can make that change from solely within the United States?” “So you’re going to try to make changes here in the Soviet Union?” Trevor asked in a tone of disbelief. “No, from the Russian Federation.” Davey countered. “The Soviet Union must end, that is obvious. History records its fate over and over again. It is an unsustainable system. What we’re going to do is try to cut down on the initial corruption and growth of the crime syndicates after the Soviet collapse. We’re in position now to do that, all we have to do is wait for the change in power to happen by the end of this year.” “What we’re going to need though is your help.” I added. “Here we have influence, and frankly we are well off enough that we can lead comfortable lives, but we won’t have the capital to really make some of the differences we need to make.” “How are things going on your end?” Davey asked them. “We’re good.” Trevor said with a smile at Todd, and the two of them clasped hands briefly. It was sweet to see their fondness for each other had not changed. “I’ve been picked up by the Rams, and I’ve already had the conversation with the coach. If the story breaks about us as a couple, they aren’t going to drop me. We don’t plan on breaking the story anytime soon, but it’s a good contract.” “I’ve got good news for you as well.” Todd said with a grin. “You might actually get to see some original movies for once without having to wait for the 21st Century. I’ve signed a good deal for a script I found, and if it works out, well, we’ll be well on the way to having a comfortable financial base between what I make and what Trevor makes.” “We’re doing damn good too.” Sean said firmly with a wink at Brandon. “None of us are going to have to turn to the lottery trick this time around, that’s for sure.” “So you’re wanting to take our hard-earned money, are you?” Brandon asked with mock severity. “We’re wanting you to invest it wisely.” Davey countered with a smile for Brandon. “It’s a perfect opportunity to get in on the ground floor.” “There’s more to the world than just Russia and the United States.” Trevor replied with a frown. “Yes, but maintaining the balance of two superpowers is important.” I countered. “Let’s face it, nature abhors a vacuum, and the unbridled supremacy of the United States during the 1990’s and early 21st Century is part of what got our homeland into so much trouble in those later years, during my original timeline. A stronger Russia on the international stage in the mid to late-1990’s and early 21st Century can make a huge difference, like it did in the 2020’s and 2030’s before the vacuum after Putin’s assassination.” “Do you really think you can accelerate Russian growth and domination so quickly?” Trevor asked with a frown. “It’s not a matter of accelerating its growth so much as it is stopping its decline.” Davey countered with a grin. “The 1990’s, under Yeltsin, was a time of massive decline, especially in the first five years. Yeltsin couldn’t be bothered to handle the little details, and those were what killed the Russian Federation. He cared only about the ‘big picture’, not all the little things that let the crime syndicates gain too much power, and slowed the economic growth of the country. Along with the associated corruption that was allowed to happen, well it was a mess in those early years.” “That is where Sergei and I will make the difference.” I added. “Sergei?” Brandon asked. “Who is Sergei?” “That’s my Russian name.” Davey shrugged and I blushed. Normally I didn’t slip up like that, but for some reason it was happening more and more lately. “Sorry.” I said with a blush. “Being here, now, gives you a reason for helping to invest in Russia’s economy in the near future.” Davey added. “Now will be the time that a little bit of money can make a huge difference, and Trevor, your public sports position will be helpful too, especially if your parent’s story comes out in public after the collapse.” “They won’t like that.” Trevor frowned. “No, but it will help.” Davey countered. “Part of the initial problem is that every bit of help the United States offers at this point in time comes with a price tag that the Russian government cannot pay. Instead of treating Russia like a potential partner, they try to treat this country like a defeated enemy, and that’s something on your end that needs to change.” “I’m just a sports figure.” Trevor countered. “Hell, right now I’m not even on the ‘A’ list of things.” “No, but you’re in the best position to get the press to look at you and to listen.” I countered and Trevor frowned. “You’re asking a lot, you know.” He said with resignation. “We know.” Davey assured him. “What about Shevardnadze?” Sean asked. “Any sign he did come back in time?” “None.” I answered quickly. “It appears the jamming of the frequency he and the scientist used did work, without affecting the frequency you used, or the one that we all used the last time.” “That’s good.” Sean said with a sigh. “He’d have been back for a few years by now.” “Yes.” Davey agreed. “Look, I know this isn’t easy for any of us, but remember, this is why we did come back. We need to make the world a better place, and the only way to do that is to make sure it stays balanced.” “I agree.” Todd said with a frown. “Part of me doesn’t like it, because it feels like we’re being disloyal to the United States, but you’re right. In the long run the best thing is for the United States to have competition in the international stage.” “The same goes for any country.” Davey said. “No matter what we do, the United States must remain strong and independent.” “We agree on that.” Sean said with a nod of his head. “Now that we’ve got that out of the way, how about showing us some of Moscow?” Trevor asked. “Have you two taken up smoking?” “No!” Davey nearly shouted. “But I bet you drink vodka.” Todd laughed. “Konyechna!” I said, slipping back into Russian without even thinking about it, and Davey translated for me with a laugh. He got up and brought a bottle of vodka along with several glasses, and we proceeded to teach our friends some of the best Russian toasts we had learned over the years. It was funny watching Todd and Sean stagger around, barely able to walk as we went to dinner at a nearby restaurant later than night. They were all tired from the flight, and the plan was for them to go to bed after they’d eaten. Trevor ordered for himself, but we translated for the others and after dinner everyone was asleep within minutes upon our return to the house. “I love you.” Davey whispered as he curled up against me and fell asleep. It felt surprising good to be surrounded by our friends, and the nervousness that had been growing in me over the last few weeks faded away. Knowing the coup was coming, and that the end result was going to be good for everyone was one thing, but I kept worrying that something could still happen to Davey and I, caught in the middle of the coup. Having our friends here made it seem a much more remote possibility. Chapter 27 They were angry, and yet at the same time they were happy. The crowds that surged around us were a veritable flux of emotions ranging from extreme anger to almost giddiness about the things going on around them. Certainly it was far more emotion than we had ever seen before from the normally stoic Muscovites. So far, everything was going pretty much as we had expected. Senior members of the Soviet leadership had arrested Mikhail Gorbachev and declared an emergency across the nation. Boris Yeltsin was leading popular protests here in Moscow that started out somewhat muted, but when the army failed to open fire, erupted into full-scale public outrage the likes of which Russia had not seen since 1917. Of course there were differences. Those differences included our presence among the senior staff advising Boris Yeltsin. Say what you will about the man, and historians have always had plenty to say about him, but Boris Yeltsin understood opportunity, politics, and the feelings of the average Russian citizen. He knew that no matter what happened, from this point on his political nemesis Mikhail Gorbachev was ruined as a leader. The Russian people didn't follow weak leaders. They admired strength, dedication, and would often overlook political ideology if the leaders were strong enough. Because of the coup, Mikhail Gorbachev would never be viewed as a strong leader. Boris Yeltsin, by standing up to the coup plotters, was granted an aura of strength that resonated with the general public, and they were listening to his calls for meaningful reforms. Davey, our friends, and I made only a few contributions to the events of those days. In the five minutes the two of us had alone with him in the first day of the coup, he listened to our passionate speech about dealing with corruption. We spent three of those five minutes doing our best to convince him corruption was a big enough problem that it must be dealt with quickly once the coup was ended. \"Do you have plans on how to do this?\" He asked us with a shrewd look when we were done. \"Da.\" Davey said firmly. We were seated in Yeltsin's office and had brought briefcases with us. My lover took a large folder out of his briefcase and put it on the Russian President's desk. Yeltsin frowned before picking up the file that was five inches thick, and leafed through the first set of handwritten pages barely skimming over the text. \"You have detailed plans.\" He said simply as he shut the file and handed it back to Davey who took it quickly. It was a good thing Yeltsin had not looked past the first fifteen handwritten pages, because most of the rest was just filler, used to make it look thicker. We had counted on his disinterest in details and the thickness was really meant to just impress him. \"Give me a one-page paper with talking points.\" \"Will these do?\" Davey asked, pulling another piece of paper out of his briefcase and handing it to the President. Yeltsin looked over the handwritten paper quickly and then nodded. \"You come prepared.\" He stated gruffly. \"We believe this is a very important issue.\" I said firmly and he nodded again. \"Many of my closest advisors will not be happy with this.\" He stated. \"In the interest of moving forward into a new era, it might be good to offer a general amnesty for past wrongs.\" Davey suggested with a shrug. \"Include Black Marketers and others in the amnesty.\" I added. \"We can use their skills. They are able to move goods past the borders, under the noses of security while we cannot move goods from farms or factories to the markets on the legal roads.\" \"You two will organize this.\" He said firmly, giving us everything we had hoped for, and more. \"I will see you outside.\" \"Thank you, Mr. President.\" Davey said as we stood and left the room. The other contribution that we made came on the day Boris Yeltsin stood on the tank in Red Square. There were tears in my eyes, and the eyes of our friends who stood with us, near Yeltsin himself as he climbed on the tank. Here was history being made, and we hoped that with only slight changes it would truly make the world a better place. In the last timeline, our children had never really understood the concept of the Soviet Union and the threat that it posed to the world. They grew up in a world where the Soviet system of government had been thrown on the trash pile of history. For those of us in the previous generation, and the generation before that, we understood the danger represented by the Soviets. It was about more than just nuclear weapons being pointed at each other, and global games of brinkmanship. For as long as there had been countries and governments, such games were played. The dangers of the Soviet era were about more than just geopolitics. It represented a philosophy, an outlook on life that was antithetical to all the principles most Americans held dear. At its core, communism eliminated the ability to make a better life for yourself through your choices and actions. Yes, you were allowed some choices, but it regulated your choices, and your rewards for excellence. It eliminated the rewards inimical in doing a job to the best of your abilities. Whether you were a doctor, a factory worker, or a farm worker, it left you in the same situation. What motivation was there for a person to excel in their field? Further, it required a strict adherence to the communist philosophy. Those who dissented, or believed otherwise where shunted aside, and not given the opportunities of others who at least mouthed loyalty to the communist party. That was one reason for the inherit corruption that existed in the Soviet government. \"This is absolutely amazing.\" Todd whispered in English as we watched Yeltsin berate the troops for supporting the corrupt coup plotters. Around us the crowd surged again, and I smiled at Davey, wanting to hold his hand, but knowing better than to make such a public display of affection. His smile told me everything I needed to know, although when it turned into a frown, I began to grow worried until I noticed he was looking over my shoulder. \"What is it?\" I asked in English and he shook his head, his eyes scanning the buildings behind me. When he turned, I was surprised by his actions and started to turn and look in the direction he'd been looking, but was distracted by him running towards the tank. Davey leaped into the air, tackling Yeltsin and pulling him to the ground. For a wild moment, I thought he'd gone crazy, but I'd caught the flash of something hitting the tank, and heard the grunt from Brandon. \"Sniper!\" Davey yelled in Russian as he covered Yeltsin's body with his own while the President's security people swarmed the two of them. Sean was trying to hold up the much taller Brandon, and Todd, Trevor and I rushed over to them. Brandon was bleeding from his left shoulder, and I figured out what had happened quickly. Davey had seen the flash of a scoped rifle in the buildings behind us, figured out there was a sniper there, and acted, figuring the target was Boris Yeltsin. The bullet had ricochet off the tank, and hit Brandon. Fortunately, the wound wasn't bad, and appeared to have missed anything vital. Around us, the crowd went wild as they realized someone had just tried to shoot Yeltsin. What had been a relatively peaceful demonstration turned into a full-scale riot, and the soldiers as well as the policemen who had been standing by were suddenly fighting for their lives against the angry civilians. Somewhere another shot rang out, and then another. \"We've got to get out of here.\" I said as we were jostled by the crowd that was swaying in every direction. Trevor nodded, picking Brandon up and putting him into a fireman's carry as the rest of us tried to clear a path. Yeltsin, and Davey, were already being hustled out of the area by security people loyal to Yeltsin, and we were left to fend for ourselves. It took nearly two hours to reach a hospital, and only my government identification got Brandon in to see a doctor. The hospital was overcrowded in the extreme, and Moscow was literally on fire from the rioting. While we waited for word on Brandon, and tried to comfort a very worried Sean, we watched the sky glowing red with distant fires. A ring of militia had cordoned off the hospital, just as they were doing with important locations throughout the city. All the television and radio stations were silent, and I was wondering what had gone wrong when a black car was admitted past the security ring. Several uniformed KGB officers got out, and I knew instinctively they were here for me. Chapter 28 The KGB was an organization not hemmed in by stupid considerations like the Geneva Convention, the International Agreement on Human Rights or any of the other numerous considerations in how to treat a prisoner. When Brian arrived at Lubyanka prison they made it clear to him that he would tell them what they wanted to know, and they started the process with their fists. Part of him hoped that Davey would somehow come for him, but on the second day they gave him copies of Pravda, the main newspaper. Later that day they threw in copies of the New York Times. Yeltsin was dead, Gorbachev had ceded power to the men who had started the coup, and their hopes for a better future were dead as well. If they thought that news would break him, they were wrong. Nor did he believe the claims that Davey and the others had been captured. He wouldn't believe anything they told him about Davey until they showed Brian his lover's body, alive or dead. The beatings continued for several days, and then they began the next course of treatment. Brian remembered the War on Terror and the secrets that came out of the second Bush that caused him to be a one-term President. Davey's father had spent a great deal of time rebuilding the US reputation after the extent of how America had tortured people became widely known. The man had barely been able to prevent the former President from being tried on War Crimes charges, but eventually the furor died down. These men didn't care about any of those things. Nor were they constrained by the semantics that limited the United States in its interrogation of terrorists. There were worst things than waterboarding, sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation and loud rock music. They worked faster too, and before a week was out, Brian was ready to tell them everything he knew, give them every answer that they wanted. They didn't believe him. As he stuttered out his confession of time travel and the intention of forging a stronger, more independent Russia in the years ahead, his interrogators didn't bother stifling their laughter. Brian would have laughed too, but it wasn't that type of situation. That was when they decided to start on his fingers, tearing his fingernails off with a device that had probably been invented by the Spanish Inquisition. The same men laughed at his screams of pain, and his stuttering insistence in Russian that every word he said was true. He didn't know how long the next phase of torture lasted, but when it ended he was little more than a bleeding wreck of a human being. That was when they started giving him morphine for the pain, and even after his fingers started healing, they kept giving him the wonderful, blissful pain medicine. Brian knew he was becoming addicted, but the desire for the sweet feeling of numbness and total release from the physical confines of his body had him craving for more, begging for more when they suddenly stopped giving him the drug. All sense of time had left him when the pains of withdrawal began to cramp his stomach, and he lost the tasteless gruel they had fed him for breakfast. For days he went through withdrawal, nausea, cramps, and the awful sweats filled his days and nights while he begged for some form of relief. When the worst of the withdrawal symptoms had passed, his wishes were granted and a soldier came in to give him another shot of the drug. \"You will wash yourself today.\" The guard said as he left Brian's small cell. The door opened a little later, and another soldier brought in several basins and washrags that Brian used to clean himself. His body was beginning to recover, and even his fingernails were beginning to grow again as he washed the crusted blood off of them. His hair had been shaved off to guard against lice in this place. The bruises on his face had largely healed, leaving only the palest of splotches on his once-pristine skin. Davey might not have liked what he saw if he could see Brian at that moment, but with the morphine in his system, Brian cared little about his lover's thoughts. All of that hurt, and only the numbing drug coursing through him let him look at himself in the small mirror they had provided. \"He will shave you.\" A guard said after Brian had dressed in the faded black jumpsuit they provided him. They shoved in a kid with a shaved head like Brian's, wearing faded jeans and a dingy shirt. The boy was barely eighteen, if he was even that old, and his hands were only slightly steadier than Brian's would have been on the razor. Still, he managed to shave off Brian's growing beard with only a few nicks, and then the guard was taking him away. They came for Brian a few minutes later, leading him through the narrow concrete hallways up into the ‘proper' area of the complex. The room they left him in was small, with bare concrete walls and a chair on either side of the table. He followed their instructions to sit in one of the chairs and didn't move as they chained him to it as they'd done before. He sat in the room for a long time, long enough for the effects of the morphine to start fading, and he was preparing himself once again for the withdrawals that would come when it left his system. It was obvious this was done on purpose, so that whenever his interrogator came in, he would be more cooperative, hoping they would give him more of the drug. That was what the small corner of his brain that still worked objectively told him while the greater part of him began plotting how he could make them happy so he would stop hurting. \"Greetings, comrade.\" An older man said in Russian as he entered the room. Brian had not seen the older, overweight man with the slightly bald head before. \"Privyet.\" Brian replied, also in Russian. He wasn't sure if he could even speak in anything but the most basic English anymore. \"You are looking better, comrade.\" The man said as he sat down across from Brian and placed a stack of papers on the table. \"Thank you.\" Brian said as politely as he could manage. \"I believe you should be a writer of fiction, comrade, with the story you have spun for your interrogators.\" The man continued. \"I am Colonel Bradikov, and your case of treason has been given to me to handle. Cooperate with me and you will find me a much better person than your previous handlers.\" \"I will cooperate.\" Brian murmured and hated himself for the words as soon as they left his mouth. The shakes were beginning again already, though, and he knew cooperation was the only way to get more. \"Yes, you will.\" Bradikov agreed. \"Even in your stories, there are grains of truth, and together we will work out those grains of truth. There will be no more interrogation sessions. Just you and I here in this room. Work with me, and you will be given better food, allowed to clean yourself, and of course, medicine for your pain.\" \"What do you want from me?\" Brian asked sadly, knowing he would do whatever the man wanted now that he had promised Brian more morphine. Part of him wondered how he'd gotten to this point so quickly, but most of him didn't care. \"Truth.\" Bradikov said simply. \"Your story is a sad one, of course. You were born to Soviet dissidents, raised in the United States and sent here as a spy to undermine the Motherland. Almost you succeeded and manipulated Comrade Yeltsin into betraying the People. Now you have seen the error of your ways and beg for the opportunity to serve the People in some way to make amends. Your confession will earn you your life, and the opportunity to work hard for the good of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… that's not…\" A spark rose in Brian, trying to resist, but it faded as the shakes grew worse. \"It is the truth, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently. \"The Soviet Union is strong, despite your treason. Your confession will help the People see the truth, and know their true enemy, the United States and its greedy capitalists. You are a product of their lies, but acted out of a true desire to better the people. That is commendable, and you will live out your life in the forests of Siberia with many others of your fellow misguided anarchists. Together you might one day earn your way back into the grand society of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… I…\" Brian stammered and then frowned. There had been nothing said about Davey, or the others, and he felt a glimmer of hope. If they were free, they could build another time machine and go back in time again. They could obliterate this timeline and start afresh. He held little doubt they would find the Brian of that timeline and he would help them, so it mattered little what he did now. \"Okay. You are right.\" \"Very good, comrade.\" Bradikov smiled and he got up, crossing over to Brian's side. With a key he took out of a pocket, he unlocked Brian's shackles. As Brian rubbed his wrists, the man took a needle out of his pocket, setting it down in front of Brian with a gentle smile. \"Here, comrade, for your pain.\" \"I…thank you.\" Brian stammered out as he blushed, ashamed for the greed that filled him. He did snatch the needle though, and injected himself so that he could feel the sweet release of the drug coursing through his system. \"You are very welcome, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently as he watched Brian closely. Brian was lost in the sweet numbing sensations of the drug, and didn't mind when the guards came to escort him back to his cell. Every day after that, Bradikov would summon Brian and they would go over his ‘confession' in detail. Certainly it was as filled with fiction as anything, but Brian only protested when they tried to pin everything on Davey. That protest earned him a week in his cell going through the pains of withdrawals, and then they dragged him back to Bradikov who demanded that Brian agree with the confession that would place most of the blame on Davey. When Brian didn't break, he was sent back to his cell for another week. After a month of this, when Brian had made it through the worst of the withdrawals and his head was beginning to clear up enough that he could almost think straight again, Bradikov realized his approach wasn't working. The beatings resumed, and his fingernails that had almost finished re-growing were ripped off again. Then they forcibly injected him with more drugs, stronger drugs this time. Having to guess from the effects on him, they were stepping him up to pure heroin or something similar. \"I always assumed that perverts like you only cared about the physical things.\" Bradikov said after doctors had spent a month nursing Brian back from the brink of death. His body still craved drugs, but his mind was clearer than it had been since he'd been taken to this hell hole. There had been times in the last few weeks that he couldn't remember his own name, but he'd never forgotten Davey's. \"You have no idea what we have been through together.\" Brian murmured in Russian. \"You have chased each other across time and space according to your story.\" Bradikov huffed. \"Your friends have tried to free you, by the way, with the backing of the new American President, but to no avail. It would have been easier on you to have another to blame, but we will proceed with your confession.\" \"Nyet.\" Brian protested. \"It is too late for anything else.\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have recorded your confessions, and you look quite healthy and convincing on the video. It will be better if you stand before the court and repeat your confession, but either way, it will be done. Cooperate, and you will lead the rest of your life in a work camp. Resist and you will face the firing squad for your treason.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" Brian murmured. \"You believe your friend will build another time machine and erase all that has happened?\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have learned the Australians believe their wild story, even if the Americans do not. We know better. Our top physicists assure us that it is impossible. Truly though, if you believe we will all cease to exist when they are done, what does it matter if you cooperate?\" \"I will do it.\" Brian murmured and ignored the smile on Bradikov's face. When the Colonel set a full needle in front of him, Brian turned his face away from the small thing. \"What, you have beaten your addictions?\" Bradikov laughed and Brian frowned. Oh how he wanted that needle, but he knew better than to take it now. He'd never, in all his life used drugs like this, and he knew he never would again. \"Not all of them.\" Brian sighed, yet he did not take the needle that was offered. \"You are a man of many surprises.\" Bradikov laughed. The work camp he went to after his trial was deep in the Siberian forests. Warm during the summer, freezing cold in the winter, he lived in one of five long barracks buildings with others that had been arrested and exiled following the pro-democracy demonstrations. They were well-guarded day and night, although the work of cutting trees and preparing them for shipping left Brian too tired to even contemplate escape. The food was horrible, and the company even worse. Brian found himself facing angry people that blamed him for their being here. When he fought them off one against one, or two against one, five of the toughest brutes in the camp jumped him. Still, he injured three of them badly enough they were in the primitive medical clinic alongside him. By the time his broken ribs healed and he was put back to work with the logging crews, he'd earned grudging respect. Most of the camp drank the home-brewed alcohol every night, passing their lives into oblivion. Brian stayed away from it with the well-earned aversion he now held to all types of drugs, not just heroin or morphine. The idea of being drunk was as abhorrent now as getting wasted on a needle full of heroin which was somehow plentiful in this place. His biggest hope, as the months and then the years went by was that Davey and the others would one day finish their time machine and end the misery of this existence. Even that hope grew dim as the years went by and many of the camp's worst drunks began dying in the harsh winters. He'd long ago taken young Misha, the thirteen-year old boy that was the youngest inmate in the camp under his wing and to his bed. Not for sex, but rather to stay warm during the freezing nights that claimed so many lives. Without his protection, Misha would have long since died although he did drink himself into a stupor nearly every night. He wasn't even a legal adult, and knew he'd die in this place. The few times he'd reached out to Brian for sexual release, he'd been gently rebuffed, but never strayed from Brian's bed. When Misha began to cough at night, Brian grew worried. Part of his mind warned that he should not let Misha sleep in his bed if he was sick, but Brian cared for the boy, the one bright spot in this miserable existence. Misha was a symbol to him, a symbol that even here in this hell hole he could make the world a slightly better place for even one person. Three weeks later, Misha was in the hospital wing as pneumonia claimed his life, and Brian was soon in a bed there as well as pneumonia took root in his own lungs. Modern antibiotics could have healed both of them, but the camp's doctor would not waste them on prisoners. Only guards got that sort of treatment. Even the food rations of sick prisoners were cut so that the food would go to other, stronger workers. Brian knew he was going to die, and welcomed the delirium as his fever began to grow. They were sweet dreams in the delirium, dreams of Davey and a few other men raiding the camp, freeing him and somehow sneaking him out of the camp. Dreams of a time machine, and whispered assurances that everything was going to be okay. He had the dream several times, and when the last one happened, he knew it was going to be the last dream ever. His body was weak and he no longer even tried to cough up the fluid that was filling his lungs. As he drifted off to sleep, he hoped that he would drown from the fluid in his lungs and die dreaming of his Davey. \"Brian.\" Oh great, instead of dreams about Davey, he was now having dreams about his mother. At least they would distract him from the realities of the cold Siberian winter, and he could feel the warmness of his childhood bed. Hearing his name in English sounded odd, after all these years though, and he wondered why he was dreaming in English. He hadn't dreamed in that language in a long, long time. \"Wake up, Brian!\" \"Nyet.\" Brian murmured as another male voice was added to the dream voice of his mother's. He told them in Russian that he loved his dreams more than reality. \"What language is that?\" His mother's voice asked as he dreamed of feeling her cool hand on his forehead. \"He has a fever. Feel his forehead. Oh dear, he's sick on the first day of school.\" Thinking of the first day of school made him think of Davey. Ah, this was better after all. His last dream before he died would be about the first day of middle school, where he and Davey always seemed to meet for the ‘first time' in a timeline. That would be a wonderful thing to dream about, to dream about the future of their lives together in a new timeline, even if it never came to reality. \"Now who could that be?\" Brian's father's voice sounded worried and Brian thought he could hear the chimes of the doorbell. \"Oh, hello.\" Brian's mother's voice was filled with surprise and worry. \"Brandon, Trevor, we didn't expect to see you here. Brian's not feeling to well.\" \"That's what we figured.\" Came the familiar voice of Trevor. \"Mrs. Breckenridge, these are some of our friends, Sean Rule, Todd Williams and Davey Jones. They came with us to get Brian and take him to school.\" \"I'm afraid he's too sick to go to school.\" Brian's mother said. \"Beloved, open your eyes.\" Davey said in Russian, and his voice sounded much younger. This was a good dream, Brian decided and opened his eyes to see a twelve-year old Davey Jones smiling at him. \"Young again, you look so young again.\" Brian said and was surprised that his chest didn't hurt. Naturally he spoke in Russian. \"What language is that?\" Brian's mother asked in a slightly high voice. \"It's Russian.\" Trevor answered. \"Brian doesn't speak Russian.\" She snapped. \"He does now.\" Trevor answered. \"Look, there are some things we should probably share with you. Why don't we go into the living room and we'll try to explain while Davey helps Brian.\" \"What's wrong with him?\" Brian heard his mother ask. \"He's had a rough couple of years.\" Brandon answered sadly, but Davey was taking all of Brian's attention. \"This is a nice dream.\" Brian said as he lifted his hand and ran a finger along Davey's cheek. His lover was always a little overweight at this age, but he still looked wonderful. \"It isn't a dream.\" Davey whispered in Russian. \"Yes it is.\" Brian said. \"It's my last dream. The pneumonia is going to kill me, I know it and I'm okay with it. You'll finish the time machine and make this awful timeline go away. Just don't mess up the next one, okay? I'd hate for that version of me to go through this hell. Still, I didn't betray you. Never you.\" \"I know love, I know.\" Davey whispered softly as he bent down and planted a kiss on Brian's nose. \"We did build the machine, and before we used it, we got you out of that damn place. It was close, and you were right, the pneumonia was killing you. Still, we were able to bribe the right people and found out where you were being held. The mercenaries we hired were good, and we got you out with the KGB hot on our trail.\" \"They didn't believe me about the time machine.\" Brian murmured. \"They figured it out in the end, and they believed alright.\" Davey laughed. \"They tried assaulting the facility, but we held them off, with the help of the Australians. Who would have believed it, the Australians helping us when our own country turned their backs on us?\" \"What did you have to give them?\" Brian asked, playing along with the wonderful dream. \"Our solemn promise to not try changing the course of history again.\" Davey laughed. \"I expected them to demand one of their own go back, but they laughed and said they knew better than to mess with history. The only reason they helped us at all was because the Soviet Union was starting to duke it out with Europe and the United States. Their economy was still shit, and they had to stir up trouble in order to keep things under control.\" \"Sounds awful.\" Brian murmured, just letting himself get lost in those wonderful blue eyes that he'd dreamed about, and was still dreaming about. \"Your temperature is dropping.\" Davey said softly. \"Sean was worried that your fever in the other timeline would be replicated here because you believed you were sick. At the end you were delirious, and even though your body is healthy in the here and now, the mind has an awful lot of control over how the body works, and I know you've been through hell.\" \"We've all been through hell.\" Brian murmured, letting himself feel Davey's hand on his chest, and relishing the smile. This was definitely the best of his delirious dreams. \"This is the last time, I promise.\" Davey whispered. \"We set it so we got back here a week before you, and we had time to prepare for today.\" \"What do you mean?\" Brian asked with a frown and something deep inside began whispering to him that this was real, not another dream. It certainly felt more real than any other dream he'd had. \"We made a promise to the Australians, and we're going to keep that promise.\" Davey said with a firm expression. \"No more mucking with the timeline, for the most part. No more trying to save people from AIDS, or stopping Osama bin Laden, or getting rid of the second Bush Presidency. If people are stupid enough to vote for the man, then they're going to have to live with the consequences.\" \"But…\" Brian's voice trailed off and he realized that Davey had said the last in English. The language was coming back to him, slowly but surely. \"No buts, love.\" Davey said in a soft whisper. \"Some things will change. The others are telling your mother and father right now. They need to know because we'll need their help making sure my father doesn't do… some of the stupid things he's done before. Papa knows too. He's a smart man and he's proven in the past he can help us, and he is, you know.\" \"Let me guess, he won some money on a bet.\" Brian laughed softly, and English felt a little odd on his tongue, but good as well. This was how it should be. \"It worked, and it's enough to get things started.\" Davey said. \"No one will be rich, but we will be able to get our families off the ground in their own businesses. There will be fights when they figure it out about us, but we can win those fights as well. No going to the President though, no warning him about the future, or the next President, or the one after that. We let those events play out as they will.\" \"Is that not a little selfish of us?\" Brian asked as he sat up and leaned against his headboard to look at Davey. \"I think we've earned the selfishness.\" Davey sighed. \"What about making the world a better place?\" Brian asked determinedly. \"I didn't go through all that to just give up.\" \"What would you have us do?\" Davey asked with exasperation. \"I don't want to lose you again.\" \"Maybe, maybe there's another way.\" Brian asked with a shrug. \"I don't know, but if we really are here, well there has to be a way. We've always tried changing things from the top. Maybe we can change them from the bottom.\" \"It's worth trying.\" Davey said gently and he leaned forward until their lips met. Brian's mind was still hazy, and he knew there would be a lot of issues for him to overcome. His treatment at the hands of the Soviets had been bad, and would require a lot of time to undo all the problems he had experienced. As their kiss deepened, and he felt his love and passion for Davey grow again, he knew that it was something they would be able to do together. Together they could conquer the world. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The End.",

My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.” “They would not be interested in the likes of me.” Verakov said with a snort. “I know nothing of military secrets. My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. Chapter 25 “I do not think you understand the importance of being able to dream of a better life.” Davey said to his ‘father’ as we rode in the car back into Moscow. For the past week we’d stayed in the dacha while the old man took the time ‘off’ from work. Not that he did no work. He had an office in the dacha, and spent many hours on the phone when he was not entertaining the two of us. It had now been a few days more than three weeks since that first trip out to the dacha, and we were now heading back into Moscow for the official ‘results’ of the test. Davey and I were both nervous, since we couldn’t see how the CIA would have been able to fake those results. “You do not understand the importance of knowing your place in life, and being assured that you will have safety and security when you are old and infirm.” Verakov countered Davey’s assertion. “What good are silken dreams when they do not put food on your table or a roof over your head?” “What good is a roof over your head when you know your children will never achieve more than you have?” Davey retorted. This particular argument had been raging for two days now, and both of them were enjoying it immensely. If I had to be honest, I was enjoying it too. “In America you can have both.” I added my voice to the argument, drawing looks from both of them. There were smiles on both their faces. The truth was I liked Verakov, probably more than I liked this timeline’s version of Davey’s father. “Social security guarantees the elderly will have money in their retirement, although they do not have to depend on that alone. They can save, have their own pensions to supplement what they get from the state. If they are smart enough to purchase their own home while they are working, they will have paid it off by the time they retire, and are even more free to enjoy the fruits of a life of labor.” “But you have millions of homeless.” Verakov pounced with a wolfish smile. “Millions of your elderly, and your mentally ill roam your streets and sleep in doorways while trying to stay warm! Your Social Security does not save them!” “There is no homelessness in the Soviet Union?” Davey shot back. “None worth mentioning.” Verakov snorted. “Again, I ask what use are there dreams of yours when you can not feed your hungry or shelter your homeless?” “How much grain is being imported this year from the United States?” I asked and the man blinked at me before laughing. “No system is perfect, but we are getting there.” He countered with a slight shrug. It was true the Soviet Union imported grain every year from the United States. Their collective farming system was…inefficient in the extreme. They should have been able to grow enough food to feed their own people, but they didn’t. In some cases, it wasn’t the collectives that were the problem though. Some grew more than enough food, but that food rotted in storage because there were no trucks to take it where it was needed. It was facts like these that had ultimately led to the fall of the Soviet Union, and while we might argue about them with Verakov, we didn’t want them to change anytime soon. In less than six months, the beginning of the end would happen for the Soviet Union with the first elections in Hungary and Poland. Then the Berlin Wall would fall, and within two years of that, the Soviet Union would cease to exist. An idea was beginning to form in my head, an avenue of opportunity that had never been available to us before, but was now opening. One of the things my original Davey had always tried to change was the fallout of the Soviet collapse. He had achieved some success with that in my original timeline. Sean had told me that I had been less successful in the last timeline. Maybe, just maybe, this opportunity here with Verakov could be translated into better success down the road. “Not even the United States is perfect.” Davey admitted with a shrug of his own and Verakov nodded. “Too many people are too blinded by their patriotism to see the need for improvement in their own system of government.” Verakov stated flatly. “Maybe they fear being arrested here.” I added in as a jibe and Verakov frowned at me. “For some that is a concern, but not for those who belong to the Party and seek to further the goals of the Party.” Verakov’s voice was flat as he spoke. “To look at the Party with a critical eye, seeking to improve the dialectic is the responsibility of all Party members. We are here.” “Amazing.” Davey said as we got out of the car and looked around at the Kremlin. We had been to Red Square when we first arrived, and seen the Tomb of Lenin with its long line of tourists, but to actually be in front of the working Kremlin, where the Soviet Union, and later the Russian Federation were governed was absolutely amazing. “Do you actually work here?” “No, my offices are nearby, not in the Kremlin itself.” Verakov said kindly. “Come, you have your papers?” “Da.” Davey said as he pulled the green passbook from his suit pocket. We were both wearing our best suits today. Davey’s passbook was new, something given to him just last week by Verakov. I had received a similar one. Neither were our American passports. These were documents that actually allowed us more freedom in Moscow than most of its own citizens enjoyed. A middle-aged officer looked them over carefully before allowing us entry into the building itself. Walking through the building was different than walking through the Capitol in Washington, or even the White House. Those buildings were full of history, and you knew they were the center of power for a mighty government, but the Kremlin had even more history, and at times like now, just as much power. It was more ostentatious, and in a way more humbling. We were led to a room deep in the Kremlin, where Verakov introduced us to Yuri Maslyukov, his ‘superior’. I recognized his name as the head of the State Planning Committee, and was surprised because I had been led to believe that Verakov worked for a different branch of the government. The State Planning Committee was responsible for implementing the long-range economic plans of the Soviet Union, and was one of their most important economic bodies. “They are waiting for the two of you.” Maslyukov stated after polite words had been exchanged, and Verakov led Davey into another room while I remained, as it was clearly intended with Maslyukov. When they were gone, the man turned to me, looking me over twice before speaking again. “Walk with me.” “Yes, comrade.” I said with a slight nod as he led the way out of the room and back down the hallway of the Kremlin. “In that room, a doctor and an official from the Foreign Office are telling your friend and mine that the young man is indeed the lost twin son.” Maslyukov said in Russian after we had turned a corner. He stopped walking and gave me a very direct look. “It is of course, a lie.” “Excuse me?” I exclaimed in English and he nodded before starting to walk again. I had to hurry a few steps to catch up. “Why are they telling them this if it is a lie?” “Mika has worked hard for the Rodina all of his life.” Maslyukov stated in a matter-of-fact tone. “The Rodina likes to repay those who serve it, and the last few years have not been kind to him. For the last year, his work has not been as it should, and I was considering replacing him. It was only a few months ago that I took this position, and we have important work to accomplish. I need him, his knowledge, and his skills, but only if he is able to work hard. Your… friend has given new life to him. Mika believes the boy is his son, and his work the last few weeks has never been better.” “Then why are you telling me the truth?” I asked him with incredulity. So the CIA hadn’t been able to fake the test. But… how did they get this result? Or did they just expect it to happen and hope for the best? My incredulity was real right now. “You are both very smart young men.” Maslyukov began his explanation with a compliment. “The fact that the two of you are perverts would normally be a barrier, but in this case we will overlook this fact.” “Why?” I asked directly and got a direct answer. “Mika, with his new son at hand, will do valuable work for several more years before he retires.” Maslyukov’s answer was simple. “When he retires, you can tell your friend the truth, and the two of you can return to your country, or stay. If you stay, honorable work will be found for the both of you, and as long as you do not make your perversion public, we will overlook it and not punish you as the law requires. In staying, at least until Mika retires, you will live comfortably and have the gratitude of the Soviet people.” “Aren’t you worried we might be spies?” I asked him, just to see his response. “Nyet.” He snorted in the negative. “You are too young, although we do know you wished to work for the CIA but were rejected. Mika has already told you we know this.” “I don’t want to give up my American citizenship.” I stated flatly. “I do not think Davey will either. I do know I will want to be able to visit my family from time to time.” “All that is being arranged.” Malsyukov stated. “You will both be granted diplomatic passports. The American State Department does not wish an international incident, although they deny any switch in babies was ever made.” “They’re right.” I reminded him and he chuckled. “But we will never tell them that.” He replied. “Sergei Mikhailovich, as your friend is being told his real name should be, will be granted Soviet citizenship. You will be a legal resident of the Soviet Union. Tomorrow you will visit the American Ambassador and tell him that these arrangements are acceptable to you. Both of you will be granted visas to return to the United States for a few weeks each year, and naturally any foreign vacations you take with Mika will be permitted. When Mika is retired, you will tell your friend, but not before! Then you may decide whether to stay, or leave forever.” “Why are you doing this?” I asked him sharply, and with a deliberately suspicious tone. “You believe the Soviet Union is this gigantic creature that does not care about its people.” Maslyukov stated flatly. “You are wrong. You Americans claim your government, what is the phrase? Oh yes, ‘Of the people, by the people, for the people’ but it is not the people your government serves, it is your economy. We run our economy so that it serves the needs of our people, not some corporations or a select few. Spend the next few years learning the true Soviet Union, not the villain your propaganda has shown you. We truly care for our people, and Mika has served us long and faithfully. In some ways, we have failed him. Our doctors failed to cure his wife of cancer, but then even your doctors often fail with that. Americans die all the time in accidents like that which took the life of Dmitry Mikhailovich. The difference is that we will give him something to replace those losses.” “By lying to him.” I stated and he chuckled again. I realized that we were essentially walking in a big circle as we passed the doorway that led to the room where Davey was right now. “Some lies are not wrong.” Malsyukov shrugged. “Some lies can do more good than harm. Do you not lie to your parents about your relationship with Sergei Mikhailovich?” “My parents know.” I said with a shrug. “His do not.” It was a statement, not a question. Yes, Davey had told Verakov that. “No, they don’t.” I stated. “Why not?” Maslyukov asked. “They wouldn’t understand it.” I said sourly. “So for you two, telling the lie to them is okay?” He asked with another chuckle. “When is a lie acceptable to you and when is it not?” “We’ll be lying to them when we tell them this story is true.” I stated and he nodded. “It will hurt them a lot.” “Will they not hurt when they learn their son will never give them grandchildren?” Maslyukov retaliated, and I had to smile at his persistence. He was right of course. Everyone lied, and we always believed our reasons for lying were valid, even necessary. “I am not Russian, or Soviet, or Communist.” I said with a shrug. “Why should I care to help you maintain your form of government?” “Ah, a real question at last.” Malsyukov said. “We will give you and your friend a comfortable life, more comfortable than you would have in the United States even.” “I don’t care about that.” I said with a shake of my head. “You are not interested in money?” He asked with a raised eyebrow. “Are you sure you are American?” “We can have all that in the United States.” I answered. “Then what if I were to tell you that you and Sergei Mikhailovich have broken Soviet law?” He said in a sterner voice. “You can be sent to the gulag for five years for the things you have done in the bedroom of Mika’s dacha. Not even your State Department would seek to stop such a sentence.” “You will lose Verakov’s services if you do that.” I retorted. “We will lose him anyway, to depression, if you do not cooperate.” He countered. That should be enough protesting to make it look real. “Okay.” I said after meeting his stare for several minutes. “As I said before, you are a smart young man.” Malsyukov said more jovially, clapping me on the shoulder. “Now, why don’t you join your friend and his father? Remember, he must believe what he has been told.” “I won’t tell him the truth, not until Verakov retires.” I said firmly and the man nodded once before opening the door for me. Davey was sitting in the room, in a chair next to Verakov, but smiled and leapt to his feet when he saw me. “Brian, it’s true!” He said in a tone of disbelief, but there was a smile on his face. “Can you believe it?” “I don’t know what to believe.” I answered in Russian. “This sounds like some story out of a Tom Clancy novel.” “Pravda.” Davey agreed with a chuckle. Verakov also stood and turned to face me. “Let me introduce you to my son, Sergei Mikhailovich.” Verakov said with a hand on Davey’s shoulder. “That is the name we would have given him if he had come to us, as he should have, eighteen years ago.” “I understand.” I said calmly. “What happens now?” “I don’t know.” Davey said with a frown. “How am I going to tell Mom and Dad? And Jenny? Do we stay here?” “I would like to get to know my son, if you are willing.” Verakov said firmly. “Both of you will always be welcome in my home.” “The Soviet Union will welcome one of its own sons home, and his friend.” The older man who was in the room said gravely. “I am Yuri Andreiich Nerov, from Foreign Affairs. We have already spoken with the American State Department. I believe you have been told of the agreements made, if this remains quiet and out of the Western media?” “Yes.” I agreed. “What do you think, Brian?” Davey asked me in English. “He says we can attend Moscow State for our degrees, if we wish. We’ll even have an apartment near campus, together! They will honor our credits from Arizona State.” “I’ll do whatever you want.” I said simply. “You should get to know him better if he really is your father.” “I think… it’s not like we won’t be able to go back.” Davey said. “I just don’t look forward to telling Mom and Dad.” “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” I replied in English and he nodded. “Come, this calls for a celebration.” Nerov said as he walked over to a low credenza with several bottles on it. He poured Vodka of course, and we all toasted father and son. Two nights later we were at the U.S. Embassy in a rather uncomfortable situation. At first two mid-level State Department officials grilled us over and over again on what was really going on, and on our decision to stay in the USSR. Then the ambassador himself got us alone in his office and pulled out the big guns. The long-distance telephone call to Davey’s parents, and then my parents, was anything but comfortable. They wanted us home, especially Davey’s parents who didn’t understand why he wouldn’t believe that they knew he was their son. This whole situation was stressful to them, and Davey knew through our secret tapping system that the test results were really a lie. Fooling his parents wasn’t easy, and it was only the promise of a visit over Christmas that kept them from going to the media immediately. Verakov took us to the Black Sea resort that was the favorite of members of the Politburo and their senior staff. Whatever his humble beginnings, Uncle Mikhail, as he insisted I call him, was one of the elite of Soviet society now, and lived a fairly comfortable life. Even while relaxing on the beaches of the Black Sea, though, he was working and Davey and I learned a lot about his work just from overheard conversations. We learned even more from the philosophical conversations that Davey had with the man while we settled into life in his dacha. The man was intent on convincing Davey that communism was the right way to govern a society, and Davey was proving a capable debater. He deftly steered their discussions into areas where the man actually revealed quite a bit about economic production in the Soviet Union, and the problems they faced. Occasionally I would get involved in the conversations, but I tended to give ground easier than Davey did. When classes began again at Moscow State, we were enrolled the same as any other students, or at least any other students of the elite. The required courses on Marxism-Leninism were non-negotiable, as were the math requirements harsher than their American counterparts. Davey was chagrined to learn he would be taking more math than he would have at Arizona State. Then there was the fact that everyone now called him Sergei. Even I called him by that name, only using his real name when we were having sex. It took him two weeks into the semester until he answered to it as he would to his real name. My name was also ‘russianized’, with people taking to calling me Yuri for some reason. I never quite got the connection, but Davey insisted that if he had to go by Sergei, I would answer to Yuri. When December rolled around, we learned just how cold a Russian winter could be. Both of us were happy to get on the Aeroflot flight that would eventually take us back to California. It was a long flight, with a stopover in Japan before we landed in San Francisco where both of our parents met us. His folks whisked him away with barely a word for me, while my mother kept on touching me to make sure I was really there. “What is really going on, Brian?” Dad asked when we were in the car and driving back towards Modesto. Davey had called, and written his parents every week, just as I had done, and their responses had become more and more distressful as time went by. Mikhail Verakov had not been happy to let us go, but seemed confident we would return. “You were told about Davey’s birth.” I answered in English that was actually a bit rusty. “Don’t tell me you believe that story?” Mom snorted. “Does it matter if we do or not?” I asked. “The Russians do, and Verakov believes it. You know how bad the story would make our government look if it ever got out. It’s just easier to let things happen this way. It’s not like they’re going to make Davey live there forever.” “What do you mean?” Dad asked. “And that’s Davey. Why are you staying?” “Would you leave Mom?” I asked him with a snort and he shook his head. “As for what I mean, well, when Davey and I graduate from college, things will change. Verakov will have gotten to know Davey for a few years, and he’ll be less… needy is the word I think. He’s just asked Davey for a few years to get to know him. He’s lost all his family you know.” “That doesn’t mean he has a right to take other people’s family.” Mom said sternly. I could only imagine what Davey was getting. “Well, both you and Davey have appointments with psychologists who specialize in dealing with Stockholm Syndrome. We’ll get you set right.” “You think we were taken hostage?” I asked, surprised by my own parents. “What other explanation is there?” Mom said and I laughed. This was going to be fun. In the end, it was Trevor’s father who took both parents aside for several long conversations. When he was done with them, our parents gave us dirty looks, but didn’t protest when we packed our bags to return to Moscow. Davey’s parents were downright frosty to both of us, not even taking him to the airport. It was on the flight back I learned that they finally knew exactly what our relationship was, and they’d threatened him with being disowned if he didn’t dump me. Then they blamed my parents for the whole mess, and I wasn’t sure how that was going to affect the business they all operated as a group. Mika was happy to see Davey when we landed in Moscow. It was even colder than it had been when we left. Oddly, Davey looked more comfortable here than he had the entire time in California. This whole thing was going to take years to smooth over when everything was done. I’d left nearly two hundred pages of hastily typed notes for Mr. Rush before we left, and I hoped whatever information was in there was worth the cost Davey, and to a less extent, I, would be paying for this – emotional as well as physical. Twice over the next year, I met Alexei Shevardnadze. It was eerie standing in the same room with the person who had caused so much trouble in previous timelines. The scientist was dead, though, and there was no need to kill the Russian this time. Still, it was interesting to know that I could have done it if it was necessary. As 1989 progressed, the discussions between Mika and Davey became less and less frequent. If you read Pravda, or watched the government news, you might not know that Hungary and Poland had elected non-communist governments. Nor would you truly understand that the Berlin Wall no longer existed. Still, news of those events percolated on the campus of Moscow State, and on the streets of the city itself. Knowing what was coming, and seeing the effects of those events on the populace was interesting. The signs were everywhere of the cracks in the foundations of the Soviet Union if you knew what to look for, but its leadership went along like nothing had changed. That year I went home for two weeks in the summer, and had several long talks with Mr. Rush, as well as leaving him a two-hundred page book on everything Davey and I were observing. In those notes were predictions that within the next few years, major changes would be seen in Soviet government. They didn’t come right out and say the Soviet Union was going to crack like an egg, but they hinted at it. That summer, we went to Samarra with Mika, and Davey got to meet several ‘cousins’ that still lived in the region. It was a closed region, where few if any Westerners had ever visited, and when I went back for Christmas, again alone, Mr. Rush seemed quite enthralled with my notes from the visit there. 1990 was going to be a long year for the Soviet Union, and I had front-row seats with Davey for the excitement. The 1988 reforms of Gorbachev, allowing for the first time since 1922 private property, private ownership of business and manufacturing plants were starting to have their effect on the national economy. Mika was at the heart of the storm, and while we stayed in the Moscow apartment that had been provided, we barely saw him during the week. On the weekends he looked like he was aging every week, growing older and older. Davey took to worrying over his health more than anything else. One thing I’d always underestimated was the news programs. As time went by, the reforms of Gorbachev relaxed the Communist party control over the media. For the first time, the Soviet people were learning some of the sordid history of their nation. From Stalin’s purges to the abysmally high suicide rate, information that had been kept from them was becoming public, and shaking the faith of the average citizen on the street. Since the early days of the cold war, the United States had tried telling Soviet citizens about these atrocities and problems, but their broadcasts reached few people inside the nation, and were believed by even fewer. Several of those we met who were near our age group could sing every song by American (and British) rock bands that they heard over the pirate American broadcasts, but would laugh about stories of Stalin’s atrocities, until they heard about it on Moscow news. By the time we were ready to graduate with our degrees from Moscow State, I was quite certain that I wanted to stay and watch this all the way through. It was still winter outside, and there was a lot of snow on the ground when we went to a dinner at Mika’s house. Maslyukov was there, with his wife, as were several other apparatchiks who worked with the two men. It was a semi-formal affair, but the discussion took a surprising turn after the dinner itself was over, and we sat in a room sipping cognac in front of the fire. “Do you know what our work is right now?” Maslyukov asked Davey and I after taking a puff on his cigarette. So far Davey and I had both resisted taking up smoking, which all these men did with relish. “I have a few thoughts.” Davey admitted. “There is much privatization of businesses going on now and you play some role in that.” “We are supposed to be supporting the private ownership of business and manufacturing while still maintaining control.” Maslyukov stated sourly. “It does not go well. Production is still down, and our economy worsens instead of improves.” “Maybe you have the wrong people buying the businesses.” Davey said quickly, hitting a key point I’d shared with him about the problems of post-Soviet Russia. “What do you mean?” Maslyukov asked. “Who is buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “Those with the resources to do so, Sergei.” Mika stated with a chuckle. “You know this already, or should.” “Yes, but why are they buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “What is their motivation for owning them?” “To make money.” Maslyukov, a true communist said it with a frown. “That is the problem. They do not care about the good of the nation, they care first about making more money.” “That is always the problem with capitalism, but it does work.” Davey said. “The problem is not just with production, it’s with distribution, which is still state-controlled, and it is with the ownership. Here in Moscow, the small restaurants and other types of businesses that are opening are flourishing. That is because they can buy the goods they need to sell, and because they live here. They care about not only making a profit, but doing right by their neighbors who are their customers. A person in Moscow who buys a factory in Samarra does not care about the people in Samarra. He cares about his factory making money.” “So how do you solve this?” Maslyukov asked with real interest. “No one in Samarra has money to buy the factory.” “No one.” Davey said with emphasis on the second word. “Establish a fund to help the workers in the factory take out a loan and collectively buy the factory. If the workers of the factory own it, depend on it for their lives, and receive back the fruits of their labor from dividend payments, they will work harder. They will vote to hire managers that know what they are doing, and get rid of those who do not.” “But that does not solve the transportation problems.” I added. “What good does it do to make more automobiles if you cannot move them to where people can afford to buy them?” “How would you improve our transportation, my young man American friend?” Maslyukov asked. Should I reply honestly, and take the risk of actually helping the Soviet Union? No, the suggestion would only speed up its end, or be a contributing factor to that end. “Much the same way as what Sergei suggested.” I explained. “Truck drivers do not care if they arrive on time if they are not being rewarded for their work. Enable them to achieve their own control over their own work. Establish a fund that will loan them the money to buy their own trucks. You won’t really be spending any more money than you already did to buy the truck the first time. You are just moving money around on paper. Charge them a little interest. They will own the truck, and be able to offer their services to those who have goods to move at a fair price. Monitor their prices, and those that cheat too much can be punished. In English we call it ‘gouging’. “But there isn’t really infrastructure to support all that.” Davey said with a sigh. “The roads are awful, and fueling stations are not all that common. They would have to be privatized too in order to make this work.” “That is the problem.” I agreed with him. “You cannot just turn one part of the economy into private business without also converting those that support such businesses. A puzzle is only little pieces until you put them all together to form a whole.” “Yes, it is as you have said, Mika.” Maslyukov said. “Looking at only one tree has blinded us to the whole forest.” “It is something we should think about.” Mika added, and the conversation changed to the weather and when we thought spring would finally arrive. By summer, Davey and I found ourselves in positions I had not expected: working as assistants to Mika. Certainly we were very junior, and watched very, very closely, but we found some of our suggestions actually being considered, and one or two implemented. I was certain they would not help strengthen the Soviet Union, but held my breath just the same. That summer Davey did not go back to America at all. His family was still not speaking to him, and my parents explained that David Jones Sr. had quit working for their budding corporation, even though he still owned a fair amount of stock. It wasn’t quite clear what he was doing, but he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. Mr. Rush was not alone when I went to visit him this time. Mr. Long was there as well, and I had a direct debriefing that summer that lasted almost all of the two weeks. I barely had time to spend a day with Trevor and Todd as well as Brandon and Sean, all of whom were busy with their own lives. Todd was working on movie sets, trying to become a director. Trevor was drafted by L.A. and playing professional football as a backup quarterback. Brandon and Sean were starting up their own computer firm and had settled in Massachusetts. Before I returned, there was one more meeting with Mr. Long, who told me to keep doing what we were doing. There were several people at the CIA who now believed it was entirely possible the Soviet Union could collapse any day now, and they were looking forward to seeing it become reality. He was even more excited about our new jobs, and was considering setting up a system whereby we could sneak information out more frequently. Davey was happy to see me when I returned, and he had a very worried look on his face as he met me at Moscow’s airport. “What’s wrong?” I asked him, switching back to Russian easily now. “It’s father.” Davey said with a frown as we walked to the waiting car. He had started calling Mika that last year. Never any shorter name, always ‘father’. “What is it?” I asked him. “He is in the hospital.” Davey said sadly. “The doctors say it is only a matter of time.” “I’m sorry.” I said as we got in the car. “Are we going to see him?” “Yes, he’s been asking for you.” Davey said with a slight smile. “He misses his ‘third’ son.” “I missed him too.” I said, and was only partly surprised at the truth of that statement. Chapter 26 We buried Mikhail Verakov twelve days after I returned to Moscow. Like so many other Russian men, he died from lung cancer and pneumonia. Over the last few years, I had seen the close bond that had developed between Davey and this man, and so I wasn’t surprised at how hard Davey took the man’s death. Mika was not Davey’s real father, and Davey knew that, but he loved the man anyway for a variety of reasons. Part of it had to do with the unconditional love that Mika had always given him. Even at its best, Davey’s relationships with his parents had always been conditioned by a variety of factors. They had certain expectations of him in every timeline, and he was constantly struggling with them in one way or another, even when they accepted him, and our relationship. He had to prove to them that he wasn’t a disappointment even though he was gay. With Mika, there had been none of that. The old man had accepted Davey, or Sergei as he’d always called Davey, as Davey was, without condition. Davey did not have to do anything to please the man, or to be loved by the man. All he had to do was be there. It was certainly a far easier relationship for Davey. Davey spoke at the funeral, which was attended by a lot more people than we had expected. It wasn’t a religious service of course, and many of the people were dignitaries of the Soviet government. After the funeral, we even spoke a few words with the Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev. That was quite an eye-opening experience for both of us since we had rarely even seen the man before and certainly never spoken to him directly. Davey and I didn’t speak about the future after the funeral, but rather I comforted him while he cried. I’d been there with him in my original timeline after his parents had each passed away, and knew he took these types of situations very hard. The future could wait while he grieved. We spent that night at Mika’s dacha out in the foothills instead of at our apartment. There, on the mantle over the fireplace, new pictures had been added in recent years, pictures of Mika and Davey, and even a few of me up there as well. In all of them, Mika’s lips were curled upwards. “You have a visitor, Sergei.” Lina, Mika’s older housekeeper said on the morning of the third day. Mika’s driver was no longer around, but she was still here, taking care of the house and helping to fix our meals while we stayed. She was a widower, and her children were grown and had families of their own now. Her work here had been a semi-retirement for her, and I idly wondered what would happen for her now. For that matter, what would happen with this house? “Who is it?” Davey asked in a soft voice. “Comrade Maslyukov is here.” She responded. “Please, bring him in.” Davey said quickly, turning from the picture on the fireplace and straightening his shirt. We were both wearing dark slacks, and Davey was in a white dress shirt while I was wearing a light green polo. Both of us straightened our hair a bit before heading down the stairs. “Comrade Maslyukov, welcome.” Davey said formally as we came into the living room. “Comrade Verakov, you have my condolences.” Maslyukov said with a short nod to Davey before he turned to me. “Comrade Breckenridge, you have honored our agreement over the last few years. I am here to honor my part now.” “You are referring to the fact that Comrade Verakov was not really my father.” Davey said calmly and Maslyukov shot me an accusing glare. “Please, Comrade, I knew from the beginning that he was not. Yuri did not have to tell me anything. I think in the end, even he knew that I was not his other son, but it did not matter. Family is more than blood, sometimes. Mika needed family, and he was a good man who deserved to have a family. I was honored to give him that.” “Interesting.” Maslyukov said as he sat down hard. Davey nodded and crossed to the small bar, pouring three shots of vodka and handing one to me before giving one to the older man. We toasted the memory of the departed and Maslyukov downed his quickly. “I liked him the first time I met him, and knew he was a good man.” Davey continued his explanation calmly. “He seemed so lonely, and did not deserve that. When I saw how he was able to accept me as I am, without judgment, I knew I would give him what he wanted: a son.” “This is a copy of his will.” Maslyukov said after he had digested Davey’s words. He took out a folded paper from his suit coat and handed it to Davey. “You will see that he has left you all of his possession. They are not as much as your American father has, but you can live comfortably in the USSR with this.” “Are we still welcome here?” Davey asked. “It is a fiction that I am a son of the Soviet Union.” “It is fiction, yes, but the records all say now that it is a fact.” Maslyukov shrugged. “If you wish to stay, if both of you wish to stay, you will be welcome. I am worried for the future.” “Why?” I asked, speaking for the first time in this conversation. Maslyukov held out the tumbler he had emptied, and waited while Davey filled it for him. The older man downed it again and looked out the large windows behind us and motioned for both Davey and I to sit. We did, sitting next to each other on the couch. “I fear the Union is crumbling.” Maslyukov’s voice was faint. When both Davey and I looked nervous he chuckled. “The listening devices were removed last year. Neither of you have said, or done, anything that our spies have disapproved. They were quite upset that you were not spies.” “There were no military secrets for us to steal.” Davey shrugged and Maslyukov chuckled again. “It is possible the American government has been looking in the wrong places for our secrets all these years.” Maslyukov stated in a sad tone. “I never thought to see the day when the Union would be crumbling. The Germans talk of reunification with the capitalist brothers. The European states talk of independence, and even the Baltic states are grumbling that they were once sovereign. I fear that only tanks and soldiers will keep them in the Union, and this is not the 1950’s. Gorbachev is not Kruschev, to crush them under his boots and force them to comply. As things stand now, the Union will not survive more than five years.” “I would give it two at most.” I said, taking a risk. Maslyukov gave me a hard look and then nodded abruptly. “That is a bet I will not take.” He grumbled. “You have proven to be quite intelligent, both of you.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Sergei, I fear for what comes.” Maslyukov stated. “I wonder what will happen to the Rodina if the Union dissolves. Will we become capitalists only concerned about making more rubles and discard our principles?” “That is a possibility.” Davey said with a frown. “Mika and I had many conversations about the dangers of unfettered capitalism. I do not agree with communism, I believe you know that.” “Yes.” Maslyukov agreed. “Mika said you might make a socialist, but never a communist.” “True.” Davey agreed bluntly. “Even socialism though, does not work, in my belief. It is more accurate to say I believe in controlled capitalism. A field where any man may achieve his dreams, but all have the chance to play the game.” “Yes, Mika told me of this.” Maslyukov said with a shake of his head. “That is why I would ask you two to stay. You will never rise to a position like mine, or even that of Mika, but I would listen to your ideas as we struggle to keep the Union alive. Can you stomach that, even though you were born American?” “What if the Union does not survive?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow. “What then?” “Then, you will help build a new Rodina.” Maslyukov said with a shrug. Before coming to Moscow, I’d have never expected to hear a Russian say something like this. Davey and I hadn’t spoken about the future, but he obviously had been thinking about it, and reached some decisions. I knew him, and could reason out what his thinking might be without having to talk it out. He knew I was always worried about the days after the fall of the Soviet Union. As Sean had said, my plans for trying to help from the outside had failed. Maybe working from the inside would see a different result. The long range plans would be affected of course, but they had been centered on more than just the United States. They were not about setting up a third political party in the United States, or getting any one individual elected. No, the plans were about changing how people looked at the world, and about the role of government and the individual. It was about taking responsibility for ourselves as individuals, and as a society. “I am willing to stay.” I said after we had all remained silent for a long time. Davey nodded, and Maslyukov nodded. “Then I will see the two of you in my office next Monday.” Maslyukov as he stood up and prepared to leave. “We have much work to do.” He wasn’t lying, either. There was a lot of work to do. Over the next few weeks, and months, we butted head with several different factors. First of course, was that this was still the Soviet Union, and its bureaucracy was filled with loyal communists. Gorbachev said he wanted private ownership, but those who had to implement such things considered private ownership anathema. Then there was corruption. Corruption had always been a part of the bureaucracy. To one extent or another, it was always a factor no matter the form of government. That was why, in the United States, anti-corruption laws were so important. One of the reasons America’s form of government worked was because corruption was limited, kept under relative control. The fact that every year there was at least one corrupt lawmaker getting caught was a testament to how well the system worked, not necessarily to its failure. Failure was when corruption happened and was never caught. In the more authoritarian USSR, corruption was far more rampant. Those in authority had more power, and in many cases investigators were either hamstrung in their ability to root it out, or had no interest. Blatant corruption of course was dealt with, and every so often the government would trot out an excessively corrupt bureaucrat as an example, but few of those in power feared being hauled off to prison. The changing rules on property and business ownership meant that more and more people were seeing opportunities to make a quick ruble, and many of them lacked any sense of ethics. We were still outsiders for the most part, and while they called us ‘Sergei’ and ‘Yuri’, and we all spoke mostly Russian, those we worked with and for rarely forgot that we were not really Russian. It was a barrier for us, but not an insurmountable one. Davey’s relationship with his family back in the States continued unchanged. They didn’t speak to him, and he didn’t speak to them. My parents told me that Mr. Jones had patched up his relationship with them, and gone back to work at the company that Dad still ran. When I visited them towards the end of Spring, they questioned me intently on why I was staying in the USSR. At Mr. Rush’s house, Mr. Long was waiting expectantly for me. I had another long series of reports for him, and he was most interested in hearing about Maslyukov’s statement regarding the USSR crumbling. He explained how he was filtering our reports through several different channels, making it almost impossible to track down where they came from, which was a good thing because I knew of at least one spy that was operating within the CIA at this time. I could have warned him about that person, but I had not come up with a way to explain how I knew about that person, while not creating the expectation that I would know of other things. Davey and I continued a comfortable existence in Moscow by and large. Occasionally, some woman from work would express an interest in one of us, but would look somewhere else when we showed no interest. At night, we would occasionally go out with groups of co-workers, or Russian friends from University. Both of us enjoyed the many theaters in Moscow. Not the movie theaters, but the stage plays, ballets, and even the opera, although Davey didn’t like operas nearly as much as I did. Back in March of 1990, Gorbachev had sent tanks into Lithuania to prop up the communist government. Later in that same year, Latvia and Estonia began the process of declaring their independence, and the tanks did not roll in to stop them. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, we watched along with the rest of the world as the United States rallied together an impressive coalition to throw Iraq out of that small country. When the battle began in early 1991, our friends in Moscow reacted with shock at the total collapse of Saddam’s largely Soviet-supplied and trained military. While the world was occupied watching what was happening in the Middle East, the KGB and Soviet Army troops again took to the streets in Lithuania. Their nationalist media was going further than the other states in pushing for independence. Maslyukov remained tight-lipped about the meetings of the Central Committee, but we could tell they were growing more and more intense and fractured. There were days that Davey and I held our breaths, or had to bite our tongues to keep from revealing too much knowledge of what was right around the corner. While US troops mopped up operations in Iraq and Kuwait, the Soviet Union voted. Davey was technically a citizen, and actually got to take part in the vote. It was in March of 1991 that nearly eighty percent of Soviet citizens voted to keep the Soviet Union, albeit in a reformed manner. Most of the ‘breakaway’ states didn’t want to lose access to the larger Russian markets that full independence would bring. What they wanted was less central-control from Moscow, and more local control. Maslyukov breathed a sigh of relief that his Soviet Union had passed a major crisis and survived. I didn’t tell him what was right around the corner. Boris Yeltsin was running for the office of President of the Russian SFSR against Nikolai Ryzhkov. Mikhail Gorbachev was supporting Ryzhkov, but we both knew it was Yeltsin that would win, and in a few months stand up to the tanks of the Soviet Union. Davey and I, still using our system of tapping out messages just in case there was someone listening, discussed whether we should get involved in the campaign or not. In the end we went to Maslyukov with the matter. “Why do you want to support Yeltsin?” Maslyukov asked. Just a few years ago, elections like these, where you had several different candidates, and only one of them a member of the Communist Party would not have been possible. “I believe he will win.” Davey answered. “Yes, but why do you want to support him?” Maslyukov pushed and Davey looked at him with a confused expression for a moment. “This is not America, Sergei. Supporting the wrong candidate here is much more dangerous, especially for one who works for the Soviet Union. No, don’t get that look on your face my young friend. This is no longer the old Soviet Union. Lefortovo will not be graced with your presence just for supporting Yeltsin. Still, I might be told that your work is no longer needed here, and I will find it hard to disagree.” “We will miss working for you, comrade.” Davey said quietly, but firmly. “There are other jobs in Moscow, though.” “Especially if you helped with the right campaign.” Maslyukov nodded and then he sighed. “We will have to keep in contact.” “Of course.” Davey said with a smile. With that we left the office, and returned to work for the afternoon. That night we went home to the large townhouse that we had purchased, partly with money from Davey’s inheritance, and partly through selling some of the stocks we had received via our parents. It was one of those old eighteenth-century homes, with huge rooms, carved borders, and tall, narrow doors. Lina had dinner ready, as usual, when we got home. She had accepted our offer to live with us after Mika had died. She was now retired, receiving her pension from the state, but stayed with us for free, as well as received a small stipend to supplement her income. In return, she cooked dinner for us, and did most of the basic cleaning. Here she was close enough to her adult children that she could visit them, and her grandchildren nearly every day. It was a good arrangement that worked for all of us. The timeline was moving along so smoothly, heading straight in the direction that we expected, and even I had to admit that being where we were, at the center of change in Russia and the collapse of the Soviet Union was a breathtaking experience. Moscow was flooded with more foreigners than ever before, many of them ‘consultants’ brought in to help with the reforms of Gorbachev. It was amusing watching them struggle with the Soviet bureaucrats, so stuck in their ways, and yet knowing that change was on the horizon. Davey and I were both welcomed into the Yeltsin camp with open arms and many shots of vodka. Both of us were quite surprised that on our first day we got to sit down with Boris Yeltsin himself for nearly thirty minutes, talking about his vision of the future. Neither of us was surprised by his continued dedication to communism. The collapse of communism was by and large an accident of fate more than anything else. In order to understand how it happened, it is necessary to understand how the ordinary Russian perceived leadership. Maybe it was because of the repeated Mongol invasions, followed by Hitler’s greatest mistake of World War II where he invaded and devastated Russia before being thrown back, but the average Russian prefers strong leadership. Ideas and concepts such as communism or democracy, or feeding the poor, or even justice often take a second seat in who a Russian will support compared to the ‘strength’ of the candidate. Will the candidate be strong? Will they be able to lead Russia (or the Soviet Union) against all enemies? This theory of Russian electioneering was originally something I’d learned from the first Davey I had met. However, it had been proven over several lifetimes. The Soviet Union collapsed, according to this theory, not because of a failure of communism so much as a failure of leadership. Gorbachev took a fatal blow in public opinion when his own deputies managed to seize control from him. His deputies who took over failed to garner enough support from the public, and from the military. Yeltsin was able to seize the initiative, and because both Gorbachev and the coup plotters were pro-communist, the only alternative was to do away with the crumbling system. The only winners in that showdown were Yeltsin and his supporters, and Yeltsin won because he was seen showing strength and being victorious. Years later, when Putin took the reins of power from an ailing Yeltsin, it was his strength that allowed him to stay in power long after he should have left the position. His strength gave his viewpoints an air of legitimacy, and so he stayed in power. No one could muster the appearance of strength for many years in order to challenge him. Working on the election was an invigorating experience for both of us. It was different from American elections, but at the same time there were some core fundamentals that were unchanged. Controlling the message of the campaign was just as important, if not more important in these elections, and that was where I found my niche in working with Yeltsin’s senior advisors. Davey’s gift for writing found him working with the speechwriters for Yeltsin’s addresses, and after his victory (which was unsurprising for us), we found ourselves in middle-level positions of the administration of the Russian state government. It wasn’t too difficult for us to obtain visas for our friends to come out and visit us the week before the coup we expected to happen. Trevor was the most difficult to arrange, mostly because his parents were defectors, but even he was able to obtain a visa in this age of perestroika. They arrived on a British Airways flight in Moscow’s main airport, and Davey and I were there to meet them. The changes in our friends over the past several years were shocking to us in many ways. We had kept in touch by letters, and the occasional phone call, but seeing them after all these years was different. Trevor’s brown hair was cut short, and he was in great physical shape. Todd’s hair was longer, and paler red than it had been years ago. Brandon’s hair was longer, nearly touching his shoulders, and he was slimmer than I had expected. Sean’s hair was darker, and his freckles had started to fade, but he was actually more built up than Brandon. “Look at you two.” Trevor said with a smile after we had all hugged in the middle of the airport’s concourse after they had passed through customs without too much trouble. “What?” Davey asked in English. “You look… Russian.” Trevor said, also in English. He alone of our friends had any fluency in Russian. “We have been here for a few years.” I replied with a slight smile, and found it odd to be speaking English after using Russian almost exclusively all these years. Actually, I’d used English on my visits home, but speaking it here, in Moscow, felt truly odd. “Let’s get out of here.” “You’re going to love our house.” Davey promised them as we made our way out and found two taxis that would take us to the house. Davey rode in a car with Trevor and Todd while I went with Brandon and Sean in the other taxi. “Wow, it’s nicer than I thought.” Sean said as we drove down the road. “Moscow is very beautiful, especially in the summer.” I replied to his statement and heard a grunt from the driver. He was trying to take us the longer way to our destination and I spoke to him briefly in Russian. The driver frowned, but nodded and turned back to the shorter path. “Are we really going to the ballet tomorrow night?” Brandon asked with a slight grin on his face. “Yes.” I assured him. “That will be fun.” Sean agreed. The chatter continued like that, with no references to the real reason for their visit. I played the good tour guide, pointing out important historical sights along the way to the house, and when we reached it, I paid the driver off with a very slight tip since he’d tried to cheat us. “Can we talk freely here?” Trevor asked in English once we’d gotten inside the house and were all sitting in the living room. Lina was visiting her grandchildren today, and so we had the house to ourselves. “Yes.” Davey assured them. “Why’d you want us here?” Brandon asked with a frown. “Not that it’s not good to see you guys again. I mean, we haven’t gotten together at all in years, so why now?” “You know the coup is about to happen.” Davey said with a frown. “We thought you’d want to see it in person.” “Well, kind of.” Trevor shrugged. “But, what does this all have to do with our long-range plans? Why are you two here instead of in the U.S.?” “I think I overlooked something important in those plans.” I said with a sigh and looked up to see their expressions of surprise. “What would that be?” Sean asked with a little half-smile. “I’ve made the typical mistake of American hubris.” I said with a shrug. “In the planning, I looked at things too much from a solely American perspective, always at changing things from the outside, not the inside of other nations. Look, this has always been about changing the perspective of people so that they look at the world from a larger perspective. How do we think we can make that change from solely within the United States?” “So you’re going to try to make changes here in the Soviet Union?” Trevor asked in a tone of disbelief. “No, from the Russian Federation.” Davey countered. “The Soviet Union must end, that is obvious. History records its fate over and over again. It is an unsustainable system. What we’re going to do is try to cut down on the initial corruption and growth of the crime syndicates after the Soviet collapse. We’re in position now to do that, all we have to do is wait for the change in power to happen by the end of this year.” “What we’re going to need though is your help.” I added. “Here we have influence, and frankly we are well off enough that we can lead comfortable lives, but we won’t have the capital to really make some of the differences we need to make.” “How are things going on your end?” Davey asked them. “We’re good.” Trevor said with a smile at Todd, and the two of them clasped hands briefly. It was sweet to see their fondness for each other had not changed. “I’ve been picked up by the Rams, and I’ve already had the conversation with the coach. If the story breaks about us as a couple, they aren’t going to drop me. We don’t plan on breaking the story anytime soon, but it’s a good contract.” “I’ve got good news for you as well.” Todd said with a grin. “You might actually get to see some original movies for once without having to wait for the 21st Century. I’ve signed a good deal for a script I found, and if it works out, well, we’ll be well on the way to having a comfortable financial base between what I make and what Trevor makes.” “We’re doing damn good too.” Sean said firmly with a wink at Brandon. “None of us are going to have to turn to the lottery trick this time around, that’s for sure.” “So you’re wanting to take our hard-earned money, are you?” Brandon asked with mock severity. “We’re wanting you to invest it wisely.” Davey countered with a smile for Brandon. “It’s a perfect opportunity to get in on the ground floor.” “There’s more to the world than just Russia and the United States.” Trevor replied with a frown. “Yes, but maintaining the balance of two superpowers is important.” I countered. “Let’s face it, nature abhors a vacuum, and the unbridled supremacy of the United States during the 1990’s and early 21st Century is part of what got our homeland into so much trouble in those later years, during my original timeline. A stronger Russia on the international stage in the mid to late-1990’s and early 21st Century can make a huge difference, like it did in the 2020’s and 2030’s before the vacuum after Putin’s assassination.” “Do you really think you can accelerate Russian growth and domination so quickly?” Trevor asked with a frown. “It’s not a matter of accelerating its growth so much as it is stopping its decline.” Davey countered with a grin. “The 1990’s, under Yeltsin, was a time of massive decline, especially in the first five years. Yeltsin couldn’t be bothered to handle the little details, and those were what killed the Russian Federation. He cared only about the ‘big picture’, not all the little things that let the crime syndicates gain too much power, and slowed the economic growth of the country. Along with the associated corruption that was allowed to happen, well it was a mess in those early years.” “That is where Sergei and I will make the difference.” I added. “Sergei?” Brandon asked. “Who is Sergei?” “That’s my Russian name.” Davey shrugged and I blushed. Normally I didn’t slip up like that, but for some reason it was happening more and more lately. “Sorry.” I said with a blush. “Being here, now, gives you a reason for helping to invest in Russia’s economy in the near future.” Davey added. “Now will be the time that a little bit of money can make a huge difference, and Trevor, your public sports position will be helpful too, especially if your parent’s story comes out in public after the collapse.” “They won’t like that.” Trevor frowned. “No, but it will help.” Davey countered. “Part of the initial problem is that every bit of help the United States offers at this point in time comes with a price tag that the Russian government cannot pay. Instead of treating Russia like a potential partner, they try to treat this country like a defeated enemy, and that’s something on your end that needs to change.” “I’m just a sports figure.” Trevor countered. “Hell, right now I’m not even on the ‘A’ list of things.” “No, but you’re in the best position to get the press to look at you and to listen.” I countered and Trevor frowned. “You’re asking a lot, you know.” He said with resignation. “We know.” Davey assured him. “What about Shevardnadze?” Sean asked. “Any sign he did come back in time?” “None.” I answered quickly. “It appears the jamming of the frequency he and the scientist used did work, without affecting the frequency you used, or the one that we all used the last time.” “That’s good.” Sean said with a sigh. “He’d have been back for a few years by now.” “Yes.” Davey agreed. “Look, I know this isn’t easy for any of us, but remember, this is why we did come back. We need to make the world a better place, and the only way to do that is to make sure it stays balanced.” “I agree.” Todd said with a frown. “Part of me doesn’t like it, because it feels like we’re being disloyal to the United States, but you’re right. In the long run the best thing is for the United States to have competition in the international stage.” “The same goes for any country.” Davey said. “No matter what we do, the United States must remain strong and independent.” “We agree on that.” Sean said with a nod of his head. “Now that we’ve got that out of the way, how about showing us some of Moscow?” Trevor asked. “Have you two taken up smoking?” “No!” Davey nearly shouted. “But I bet you drink vodka.” Todd laughed. “Konyechna!” I said, slipping back into Russian without even thinking about it, and Davey translated for me with a laugh. He got up and brought a bottle of vodka along with several glasses, and we proceeded to teach our friends some of the best Russian toasts we had learned over the years. It was funny watching Todd and Sean stagger around, barely able to walk as we went to dinner at a nearby restaurant later than night. They were all tired from the flight, and the plan was for them to go to bed after they’d eaten. Trevor ordered for himself, but we translated for the others and after dinner everyone was asleep within minutes upon our return to the house. “I love you.” Davey whispered as he curled up against me and fell asleep. It felt surprising good to be surrounded by our friends, and the nervousness that had been growing in me over the last few weeks faded away. Knowing the coup was coming, and that the end result was going to be good for everyone was one thing, but I kept worrying that something could still happen to Davey and I, caught in the middle of the coup. Having our friends here made it seem a much more remote possibility. Chapter 27 They were angry, and yet at the same time they were happy. The crowds that surged around us were a veritable flux of emotions ranging from extreme anger to almost giddiness about the things going on around them. Certainly it was far more emotion than we had ever seen before from the normally stoic Muscovites. So far, everything was going pretty much as we had expected. Senior members of the Soviet leadership had arrested Mikhail Gorbachev and declared an emergency across the nation. Boris Yeltsin was leading popular protests here in Moscow that started out somewhat muted, but when the army failed to open fire, erupted into full-scale public outrage the likes of which Russia had not seen since 1917. Of course there were differences. Those differences included our presence among the senior staff advising Boris Yeltsin. Say what you will about the man, and historians have always had plenty to say about him, but Boris Yeltsin understood opportunity, politics, and the feelings of the average Russian citizen. He knew that no matter what happened, from this point on his political nemesis Mikhail Gorbachev was ruined as a leader. The Russian people didn't follow weak leaders. They admired strength, dedication, and would often overlook political ideology if the leaders were strong enough. Because of the coup, Mikhail Gorbachev would never be viewed as a strong leader. Boris Yeltsin, by standing up to the coup plotters, was granted an aura of strength that resonated with the general public, and they were listening to his calls for meaningful reforms. Davey, our friends, and I made only a few contributions to the events of those days. In the five minutes the two of us had alone with him in the first day of the coup, he listened to our passionate speech about dealing with corruption. We spent three of those five minutes doing our best to convince him corruption was a big enough problem that it must be dealt with quickly once the coup was ended. \"Do you have plans on how to do this?\" He asked us with a shrewd look when we were done. \"Da.\" Davey said firmly. We were seated in Yeltsin's office and had brought briefcases with us. My lover took a large folder out of his briefcase and put it on the Russian President's desk. Yeltsin frowned before picking up the file that was five inches thick, and leafed through the first set of handwritten pages barely skimming over the text. \"You have detailed plans.\" He said simply as he shut the file and handed it back to Davey who took it quickly. It was a good thing Yeltsin had not looked past the first fifteen handwritten pages, because most of the rest was just filler, used to make it look thicker. We had counted on his disinterest in details and the thickness was really meant to just impress him. \"Give me a one-page paper with talking points.\" \"Will these do?\" Davey asked, pulling another piece of paper out of his briefcase and handing it to the President. Yeltsin looked over the handwritten paper quickly and then nodded. \"You come prepared.\" He stated gruffly. \"We believe this is a very important issue.\" I said firmly and he nodded again. \"Many of my closest advisors will not be happy with this.\" He stated. \"In the interest of moving forward into a new era, it might be good to offer a general amnesty for past wrongs.\" Davey suggested with a shrug. \"Include Black Marketers and others in the amnesty.\" I added. \"We can use their skills. They are able to move goods past the borders, under the noses of security while we cannot move goods from farms or factories to the markets on the legal roads.\" \"You two will organize this.\" He said firmly, giving us everything we had hoped for, and more. \"I will see you outside.\" \"Thank you, Mr. President.\" Davey said as we stood and left the room. The other contribution that we made came on the day Boris Yeltsin stood on the tank in Red Square. There were tears in my eyes, and the eyes of our friends who stood with us, near Yeltsin himself as he climbed on the tank. Here was history being made, and we hoped that with only slight changes it would truly make the world a better place. In the last timeline, our children had never really understood the concept of the Soviet Union and the threat that it posed to the world. They grew up in a world where the Soviet system of government had been thrown on the trash pile of history. For those of us in the previous generation, and the generation before that, we understood the danger represented by the Soviets. It was about more than just nuclear weapons being pointed at each other, and global games of brinkmanship. For as long as there had been countries and governments, such games were played. The dangers of the Soviet era were about more than just geopolitics. It represented a philosophy, an outlook on life that was antithetical to all the principles most Americans held dear. At its core, communism eliminated the ability to make a better life for yourself through your choices and actions. Yes, you were allowed some choices, but it regulated your choices, and your rewards for excellence. It eliminated the rewards inimical in doing a job to the best of your abilities. Whether you were a doctor, a factory worker, or a farm worker, it left you in the same situation. What motivation was there for a person to excel in their field? Further, it required a strict adherence to the communist philosophy. Those who dissented, or believed otherwise where shunted aside, and not given the opportunities of others who at least mouthed loyalty to the communist party. That was one reason for the inherit corruption that existed in the Soviet government. \"This is absolutely amazing.\" Todd whispered in English as we watched Yeltsin berate the troops for supporting the corrupt coup plotters. Around us the crowd surged again, and I smiled at Davey, wanting to hold his hand, but knowing better than to make such a public display of affection. His smile told me everything I needed to know, although when it turned into a frown, I began to grow worried until I noticed he was looking over my shoulder. \"What is it?\" I asked in English and he shook his head, his eyes scanning the buildings behind me. When he turned, I was surprised by his actions and started to turn and look in the direction he'd been looking, but was distracted by him running towards the tank. Davey leaped into the air, tackling Yeltsin and pulling him to the ground. For a wild moment, I thought he'd gone crazy, but I'd caught the flash of something hitting the tank, and heard the grunt from Brandon. \"Sniper!\" Davey yelled in Russian as he covered Yeltsin's body with his own while the President's security people swarmed the two of them. Sean was trying to hold up the much taller Brandon, and Todd, Trevor and I rushed over to them. Brandon was bleeding from his left shoulder, and I figured out what had happened quickly. Davey had seen the flash of a scoped rifle in the buildings behind us, figured out there was a sniper there, and acted, figuring the target was Boris Yeltsin. The bullet had ricochet off the tank, and hit Brandon. Fortunately, the wound wasn't bad, and appeared to have missed anything vital. Around us, the crowd went wild as they realized someone had just tried to shoot Yeltsin. What had been a relatively peaceful demonstration turned into a full-scale riot, and the soldiers as well as the policemen who had been standing by were suddenly fighting for their lives against the angry civilians. Somewhere another shot rang out, and then another. \"We've got to get out of here.\" I said as we were jostled by the crowd that was swaying in every direction. Trevor nodded, picking Brandon up and putting him into a fireman's carry as the rest of us tried to clear a path. Yeltsin, and Davey, were already being hustled out of the area by security people loyal to Yeltsin, and we were left to fend for ourselves. It took nearly two hours to reach a hospital, and only my government identification got Brandon in to see a doctor. The hospital was overcrowded in the extreme, and Moscow was literally on fire from the rioting. While we waited for word on Brandon, and tried to comfort a very worried Sean, we watched the sky glowing red with distant fires. A ring of militia had cordoned off the hospital, just as they were doing with important locations throughout the city. All the television and radio stations were silent, and I was wondering what had gone wrong when a black car was admitted past the security ring. Several uniformed KGB officers got out, and I knew instinctively they were here for me. Chapter 28 The KGB was an organization not hemmed in by stupid considerations like the Geneva Convention, the International Agreement on Human Rights or any of the other numerous considerations in how to treat a prisoner. When Brian arrived at Lubyanka prison they made it clear to him that he would tell them what they wanted to know, and they started the process with their fists. Part of him hoped that Davey would somehow come for him, but on the second day they gave him copies of Pravda, the main newspaper. Later that day they threw in copies of the New York Times. Yeltsin was dead, Gorbachev had ceded power to the men who had started the coup, and their hopes for a better future were dead as well. If they thought that news would break him, they were wrong. Nor did he believe the claims that Davey and the others had been captured. He wouldn't believe anything they told him about Davey until they showed Brian his lover's body, alive or dead. The beatings continued for several days, and then they began the next course of treatment. Brian remembered the War on Terror and the secrets that came out of the second Bush that caused him to be a one-term President. Davey's father had spent a great deal of time rebuilding the US reputation after the extent of how America had tortured people became widely known. The man had barely been able to prevent the former President from being tried on War Crimes charges, but eventually the furor died down. These men didn't care about any of those things. Nor were they constrained by the semantics that limited the United States in its interrogation of terrorists. There were worst things than waterboarding, sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation and loud rock music. They worked faster too, and before a week was out, Brian was ready to tell them everything he knew, give them every answer that they wanted. They didn't believe him. As he stuttered out his confession of time travel and the intention of forging a stronger, more independent Russia in the years ahead, his interrogators didn't bother stifling their laughter. Brian would have laughed too, but it wasn't that type of situation. That was when they decided to start on his fingers, tearing his fingernails off with a device that had probably been invented by the Spanish Inquisition. The same men laughed at his screams of pain, and his stuttering insistence in Russian that every word he said was true. He didn't know how long the next phase of torture lasted, but when it ended he was little more than a bleeding wreck of a human being. That was when they started giving him morphine for the pain, and even after his fingers started healing, they kept giving him the wonderful, blissful pain medicine. Brian knew he was becoming addicted, but the desire for the sweet feeling of numbness and total release from the physical confines of his body had him craving for more, begging for more when they suddenly stopped giving him the drug. All sense of time had left him when the pains of withdrawal began to cramp his stomach, and he lost the tasteless gruel they had fed him for breakfast. For days he went through withdrawal, nausea, cramps, and the awful sweats filled his days and nights while he begged for some form of relief. When the worst of the withdrawal symptoms had passed, his wishes were granted and a soldier came in to give him another shot of the drug. \"You will wash yourself today.\" The guard said as he left Brian's small cell. The door opened a little later, and another soldier brought in several basins and washrags that Brian used to clean himself. His body was beginning to recover, and even his fingernails were beginning to grow again as he washed the crusted blood off of them. His hair had been shaved off to guard against lice in this place. The bruises on his face had largely healed, leaving only the palest of splotches on his once-pristine skin. Davey might not have liked what he saw if he could see Brian at that moment, but with the morphine in his system, Brian cared little about his lover's thoughts. All of that hurt, and only the numbing drug coursing through him let him look at himself in the small mirror they had provided. \"He will shave you.\" A guard said after Brian had dressed in the faded black jumpsuit they provided him. They shoved in a kid with a shaved head like Brian's, wearing faded jeans and a dingy shirt. The boy was barely eighteen, if he was even that old, and his hands were only slightly steadier than Brian's would have been on the razor. Still, he managed to shave off Brian's growing beard with only a few nicks, and then the guard was taking him away. They came for Brian a few minutes later, leading him through the narrow concrete hallways up into the ‘proper' area of the complex. The room they left him in was small, with bare concrete walls and a chair on either side of the table. He followed their instructions to sit in one of the chairs and didn't move as they chained him to it as they'd done before. He sat in the room for a long time, long enough for the effects of the morphine to start fading, and he was preparing himself once again for the withdrawals that would come when it left his system. It was obvious this was done on purpose, so that whenever his interrogator came in, he would be more cooperative, hoping they would give him more of the drug. That was what the small corner of his brain that still worked objectively told him while the greater part of him began plotting how he could make them happy so he would stop hurting. \"Greetings, comrade.\" An older man said in Russian as he entered the room. Brian had not seen the older, overweight man with the slightly bald head before. \"Privyet.\" Brian replied, also in Russian. He wasn't sure if he could even speak in anything but the most basic English anymore. \"You are looking better, comrade.\" The man said as he sat down across from Brian and placed a stack of papers on the table. \"Thank you.\" Brian said as politely as he could manage. \"I believe you should be a writer of fiction, comrade, with the story you have spun for your interrogators.\" The man continued. \"I am Colonel Bradikov, and your case of treason has been given to me to handle. Cooperate with me and you will find me a much better person than your previous handlers.\" \"I will cooperate.\" Brian murmured and hated himself for the words as soon as they left his mouth. The shakes were beginning again already, though, and he knew cooperation was the only way to get more. \"Yes, you will.\" Bradikov agreed. \"Even in your stories, there are grains of truth, and together we will work out those grains of truth. There will be no more interrogation sessions. Just you and I here in this room. Work with me, and you will be given better food, allowed to clean yourself, and of course, medicine for your pain.\" \"What do you want from me?\" Brian asked sadly, knowing he would do whatever the man wanted now that he had promised Brian more morphine. Part of him wondered how he'd gotten to this point so quickly, but most of him didn't care. \"Truth.\" Bradikov said simply. \"Your story is a sad one, of course. You were born to Soviet dissidents, raised in the United States and sent here as a spy to undermine the Motherland. Almost you succeeded and manipulated Comrade Yeltsin into betraying the People. Now you have seen the error of your ways and beg for the opportunity to serve the People in some way to make amends. Your confession will earn you your life, and the opportunity to work hard for the good of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… that's not…\" A spark rose in Brian, trying to resist, but it faded as the shakes grew worse. \"It is the truth, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently. \"The Soviet Union is strong, despite your treason. Your confession will help the People see the truth, and know their true enemy, the United States and its greedy capitalists. You are a product of their lies, but acted out of a true desire to better the people. That is commendable, and you will live out your life in the forests of Siberia with many others of your fellow misguided anarchists. Together you might one day earn your way back into the grand society of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… I…\" Brian stammered and then frowned. There had been nothing said about Davey, or the others, and he felt a glimmer of hope. If they were free, they could build another time machine and go back in time again. They could obliterate this timeline and start afresh. He held little doubt they would find the Brian of that timeline and he would help them, so it mattered little what he did now. \"Okay. You are right.\" \"Very good, comrade.\" Bradikov smiled and he got up, crossing over to Brian's side. With a key he took out of a pocket, he unlocked Brian's shackles. As Brian rubbed his wrists, the man took a needle out of his pocket, setting it down in front of Brian with a gentle smile. \"Here, comrade, for your pain.\" \"I…thank you.\" Brian stammered out as he blushed, ashamed for the greed that filled him. He did snatch the needle though, and injected himself so that he could feel the sweet release of the drug coursing through his system. \"You are very welcome, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently as he watched Brian closely. Brian was lost in the sweet numbing sensations of the drug, and didn't mind when the guards came to escort him back to his cell. Every day after that, Bradikov would summon Brian and they would go over his ‘confession' in detail. Certainly it was as filled with fiction as anything, but Brian only protested when they tried to pin everything on Davey. That protest earned him a week in his cell going through the pains of withdrawals, and then they dragged him back to Bradikov who demanded that Brian agree with the confession that would place most of the blame on Davey. When Brian didn't break, he was sent back to his cell for another week. After a month of this, when Brian had made it through the worst of the withdrawals and his head was beginning to clear up enough that he could almost think straight again, Bradikov realized his approach wasn't working. The beatings resumed, and his fingernails that had almost finished re-growing were ripped off again. Then they forcibly injected him with more drugs, stronger drugs this time. Having to guess from the effects on him, they were stepping him up to pure heroin or something similar. \"I always assumed that perverts like you only cared about the physical things.\" Bradikov said after doctors had spent a month nursing Brian back from the brink of death. His body still craved drugs, but his mind was clearer than it had been since he'd been taken to this hell hole. There had been times in the last few weeks that he couldn't remember his own name, but he'd never forgotten Davey's. \"You have no idea what we have been through together.\" Brian murmured in Russian. \"You have chased each other across time and space according to your story.\" Bradikov huffed. \"Your friends have tried to free you, by the way, with the backing of the new American President, but to no avail. It would have been easier on you to have another to blame, but we will proceed with your confession.\" \"Nyet.\" Brian protested. \"It is too late for anything else.\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have recorded your confessions, and you look quite healthy and convincing on the video. It will be better if you stand before the court and repeat your confession, but either way, it will be done. Cooperate, and you will lead the rest of your life in a work camp. Resist and you will face the firing squad for your treason.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" Brian murmured. \"You believe your friend will build another time machine and erase all that has happened?\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have learned the Australians believe their wild story, even if the Americans do not. We know better. Our top physicists assure us that it is impossible. Truly though, if you believe we will all cease to exist when they are done, what does it matter if you cooperate?\" \"I will do it.\" Brian murmured and ignored the smile on Bradikov's face. When the Colonel set a full needle in front of him, Brian turned his face away from the small thing. \"What, you have beaten your addictions?\" Bradikov laughed and Brian frowned. Oh how he wanted that needle, but he knew better than to take it now. He'd never, in all his life used drugs like this, and he knew he never would again. \"Not all of them.\" Brian sighed, yet he did not take the needle that was offered. \"You are a man of many surprises.\" Bradikov laughed. The work camp he went to after his trial was deep in the Siberian forests. Warm during the summer, freezing cold in the winter, he lived in one of five long barracks buildings with others that had been arrested and exiled following the pro-democracy demonstrations. They were well-guarded day and night, although the work of cutting trees and preparing them for shipping left Brian too tired to even contemplate escape. The food was horrible, and the company even worse. Brian found himself facing angry people that blamed him for their being here. When he fought them off one against one, or two against one, five of the toughest brutes in the camp jumped him. Still, he injured three of them badly enough they were in the primitive medical clinic alongside him. By the time his broken ribs healed and he was put back to work with the logging crews, he'd earned grudging respect. Most of the camp drank the home-brewed alcohol every night, passing their lives into oblivion. Brian stayed away from it with the well-earned aversion he now held to all types of drugs, not just heroin or morphine. The idea of being drunk was as abhorrent now as getting wasted on a needle full of heroin which was somehow plentiful in this place. His biggest hope, as the months and then the years went by was that Davey and the others would one day finish their time machine and end the misery of this existence. Even that hope grew dim as the years went by and many of the camp's worst drunks began dying in the harsh winters. He'd long ago taken young Misha, the thirteen-year old boy that was the youngest inmate in the camp under his wing and to his bed. Not for sex, but rather to stay warm during the freezing nights that claimed so many lives. Without his protection, Misha would have long since died although he did drink himself into a stupor nearly every night. He wasn't even a legal adult, and knew he'd die in this place. The few times he'd reached out to Brian for sexual release, he'd been gently rebuffed, but never strayed from Brian's bed. When Misha began to cough at night, Brian grew worried. Part of his mind warned that he should not let Misha sleep in his bed if he was sick, but Brian cared for the boy, the one bright spot in this miserable existence. Misha was a symbol to him, a symbol that even here in this hell hole he could make the world a slightly better place for even one person. Three weeks later, Misha was in the hospital wing as pneumonia claimed his life, and Brian was soon in a bed there as well as pneumonia took root in his own lungs. Modern antibiotics could have healed both of them, but the camp's doctor would not waste them on prisoners. Only guards got that sort of treatment. Even the food rations of sick prisoners were cut so that the food would go to other, stronger workers. Brian knew he was going to die, and welcomed the delirium as his fever began to grow. They were sweet dreams in the delirium, dreams of Davey and a few other men raiding the camp, freeing him and somehow sneaking him out of the camp. Dreams of a time machine, and whispered assurances that everything was going to be okay. He had the dream several times, and when the last one happened, he knew it was going to be the last dream ever. His body was weak and he no longer even tried to cough up the fluid that was filling his lungs. As he drifted off to sleep, he hoped that he would drown from the fluid in his lungs and die dreaming of his Davey. \"Brian.\" Oh great, instead of dreams about Davey, he was now having dreams about his mother. At least they would distract him from the realities of the cold Siberian winter, and he could feel the warmness of his childhood bed. Hearing his name in English sounded odd, after all these years though, and he wondered why he was dreaming in English. He hadn't dreamed in that language in a long, long time. \"Wake up, Brian!\" \"Nyet.\" Brian murmured as another male voice was added to the dream voice of his mother's. He told them in Russian that he loved his dreams more than reality. \"What language is that?\" His mother's voice asked as he dreamed of feeling her cool hand on his forehead. \"He has a fever. Feel his forehead. Oh dear, he's sick on the first day of school.\" Thinking of the first day of school made him think of Davey. Ah, this was better after all. His last dream before he died would be about the first day of middle school, where he and Davey always seemed to meet for the ‘first time' in a timeline. That would be a wonderful thing to dream about, to dream about the future of their lives together in a new timeline, even if it never came to reality. \"Now who could that be?\" Brian's father's voice sounded worried and Brian thought he could hear the chimes of the doorbell. \"Oh, hello.\" Brian's mother's voice was filled with surprise and worry. \"Brandon, Trevor, we didn't expect to see you here. Brian's not feeling to well.\" \"That's what we figured.\" Came the familiar voice of Trevor. \"Mrs. Breckenridge, these are some of our friends, Sean Rule, Todd Williams and Davey Jones. They came with us to get Brian and take him to school.\" \"I'm afraid he's too sick to go to school.\" Brian's mother said. \"Beloved, open your eyes.\" Davey said in Russian, and his voice sounded much younger. This was a good dream, Brian decided and opened his eyes to see a twelve-year old Davey Jones smiling at him. \"Young again, you look so young again.\" Brian said and was surprised that his chest didn't hurt. Naturally he spoke in Russian. \"What language is that?\" Brian's mother asked in a slightly high voice. \"It's Russian.\" Trevor answered. \"Brian doesn't speak Russian.\" She snapped. \"He does now.\" Trevor answered. \"Look, there are some things we should probably share with you. Why don't we go into the living room and we'll try to explain while Davey helps Brian.\" \"What's wrong with him?\" Brian heard his mother ask. \"He's had a rough couple of years.\" Brandon answered sadly, but Davey was taking all of Brian's attention. \"This is a nice dream.\" Brian said as he lifted his hand and ran a finger along Davey's cheek. His lover was always a little overweight at this age, but he still looked wonderful. \"It isn't a dream.\" Davey whispered in Russian. \"Yes it is.\" Brian said. \"It's my last dream. The pneumonia is going to kill me, I know it and I'm okay with it. You'll finish the time machine and make this awful timeline go away. Just don't mess up the next one, okay? I'd hate for that version of me to go through this hell. Still, I didn't betray you. Never you.\" \"I know love, I know.\" Davey whispered softly as he bent down and planted a kiss on Brian's nose. \"We did build the machine, and before we used it, we got you out of that damn place. It was close, and you were right, the pneumonia was killing you. Still, we were able to bribe the right people and found out where you were being held. The mercenaries we hired were good, and we got you out with the KGB hot on our trail.\" \"They didn't believe me about the time machine.\" Brian murmured. \"They figured it out in the end, and they believed alright.\" Davey laughed. \"They tried assaulting the facility, but we held them off, with the help of the Australians. Who would have believed it, the Australians helping us when our own country turned their backs on us?\" \"What did you have to give them?\" Brian asked, playing along with the wonderful dream. \"Our solemn promise to not try changing the course of history again.\" Davey laughed. \"I expected them to demand one of their own go back, but they laughed and said they knew better than to mess with history. The only reason they helped us at all was because the Soviet Union was starting to duke it out with Europe and the United States. Their economy was still shit, and they had to stir up trouble in order to keep things under control.\" \"Sounds awful.\" Brian murmured, just letting himself get lost in those wonderful blue eyes that he'd dreamed about, and was still dreaming about. \"Your temperature is dropping.\" Davey said softly. \"Sean was worried that your fever in the other timeline would be replicated here because you believed you were sick. At the end you were delirious, and even though your body is healthy in the here and now, the mind has an awful lot of control over how the body works, and I know you've been through hell.\" \"We've all been through hell.\" Brian murmured, letting himself feel Davey's hand on his chest, and relishing the smile. This was definitely the best of his delirious dreams. \"This is the last time, I promise.\" Davey whispered. \"We set it so we got back here a week before you, and we had time to prepare for today.\" \"What do you mean?\" Brian asked with a frown and something deep inside began whispering to him that this was real, not another dream. It certainly felt more real than any other dream he'd had. \"We made a promise to the Australians, and we're going to keep that promise.\" Davey said with a firm expression. \"No more mucking with the timeline, for the most part. No more trying to save people from AIDS, or stopping Osama bin Laden, or getting rid of the second Bush Presidency. If people are stupid enough to vote for the man, then they're going to have to live with the consequences.\" \"But…\" Brian's voice trailed off and he realized that Davey had said the last in English. The language was coming back to him, slowly but surely. \"No buts, love.\" Davey said in a soft whisper. \"Some things will change. The others are telling your mother and father right now. They need to know because we'll need their help making sure my father doesn't do… some of the stupid things he's done before. Papa knows too. He's a smart man and he's proven in the past he can help us, and he is, you know.\" \"Let me guess, he won some money on a bet.\" Brian laughed softly, and English felt a little odd on his tongue, but good as well. This was how it should be. \"It worked, and it's enough to get things started.\" Davey said. \"No one will be rich, but we will be able to get our families off the ground in their own businesses. There will be fights when they figure it out about us, but we can win those fights as well. No going to the President though, no warning him about the future, or the next President, or the one after that. We let those events play out as they will.\" \"Is that not a little selfish of us?\" Brian asked as he sat up and leaned against his headboard to look at Davey. \"I think we've earned the selfishness.\" Davey sighed. \"What about making the world a better place?\" Brian asked determinedly. \"I didn't go through all that to just give up.\" \"What would you have us do?\" Davey asked with exasperation. \"I don't want to lose you again.\" \"Maybe, maybe there's another way.\" Brian asked with a shrug. \"I don't know, but if we really are here, well there has to be a way. We've always tried changing things from the top. Maybe we can change them from the bottom.\" \"It's worth trying.\" Davey said gently and he leaned forward until their lips met. Brian's mind was still hazy, and he knew there would be a lot of issues for him to overcome. His treatment at the hands of the Soviets had been bad, and would require a lot of time to undo all the problems he had experienced. As their kiss deepened, and he felt his love and passion for Davey grow again, he knew that it was something they would be able to do together. Together they could conquer the world. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The End.",

      "content": "“They would not be interested in the likes of me.” Verakov said with a snort. “I know nothing of military secrets. My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. It was going to be another hot, bright, glorious day. Davey and I made our tenth and final lap around the track, and slowed from our slow run to a fast walk as we began to cool down. Both of us were wearing the red and gold sweat suits of ASU, as we normally did on our morning run. There were a few other students around, but most of them stayed far away from us. “It’s going to be hot, today.” Davey said in Russian. It had been four weeks since the last time we spoke English, just before getting on the plane that brought us here, to Moscow. That first morning here, at Moscow State University, when we’d gotten up for our regular morning run had caused quite a stir. Our ‘minders’ weren’t too thrilled with the fact that we’d managed to slip out in our red and gold sweats and make our way to the track where we ran two and a half miles before anyone knew we were gone. Our sweats had blended in with the communist red fairly well. Now though, a young man no older than us, wearing the uniform of the Moscow police, stood near the stands keeping a close eye on the two of us. He, or someone like him, was there every morning, and I was pretty sure that attractive woman who always started her run ten minutes after us, and finished right behind us was also assigned to keep an eye on us. It was almost funny, the way they kept a watch on Americans here in Moscow. You’d almost think we were all spies or something. “Who is doing the guest lecture today?” I asked Davey as I stretched out while we turned back towards the ‘dormitory’ we American students shared. It was more like an Army barracks, a piss-poor one at that. Whoever said communists didn’t know anything about making a buck got it wrong, considering the outrageous amount we’d paid for ‘lodging’ in a barracks the Army would consider sub-standard. “A man named Verakov.” Davey said with a shrug. “I heard he is some sort of economist or something. Professor Vernon wasn’t sure.” “Another lecture about the great triumphs of the working people.” I said with a little eye roll. He laughed at the comment and shook his head. “They do beat the drum a lot.” Davey said in what was probably a mangled translation of an American expression. We were studying ‘conversational’ Russian, and learning just how much even our education was lacking when it came to sounding like a native. “Verakov.” I said with a frown as we neared the barracks. “Didn’t we meet him at that party two weeks ago? He’s older, in his sixth decade.” “Yes, I think we did.” Davey said with a frown for whoever was watching or listening. There was a hint of mischief in his eyes. We had indeed met our target two weeks ago, and the man had not taken his eyes off of Davey for the rest of the night. Two days later we noticed a few new faces in the entourage that followed us whenever we left campus. We entered the building where most of our fellow students were just getting up, endured the cold showers since hot water never seemed to work, and quickly got dressed for the day. One lesson learned early on was to make sure our clothes were firmly locked up. Brad Wilson had lost three pairs of jeans because he didn’t lock his locker. Our American Professor met us in the dining hall where we were subjected to food that was about the same as could be expected in any cafeteria, and took the regulatory head count along with one of his Russian colleagues. After Jennifer Armstrong had managed to sneak out one night with a young comrade, they were extra careful about making sure we were all where we were supposed to be. The morning propaganda began after breakfast with a course in ‘Reading Russian Literature’. Naturally all the material we were reading dealt with Marxism/Leninism, as currently defined by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Davey and I had been playing a subtle game in this class, starting off with vociferous skepticism and scorn for the reading material. As the weeks went by, we kept asking questions, and getting interesting answers. Instead of tearing the sometimes weak answers apart, we pretended as if they were making us think. It had created a slight rift between us and the other American students who sometimes sniggered at the material we were given to read, but it set what we thought might be the right image. We had to be careful to not go overboard with the whole thing, but to keep it believable. Obviously we were well-watched as a group here on campus, but whether anyone took really detailed notes on us we weren’t sure of yet. “Today we have a special guest who will be able to answer a few of the questions posed by comrade Jones and comrade Breckenridge.” Professor Natasha Borisnaya Karesova said proudly. She was a tall woman, with brown hair and a well-connected father. On the first day of class she had proudly told us that he worked at the KGB. Professor Vernon had warned us that her father didn’t just work there, but was very senior in that organization’s structure. “I am honored to welcome to my classroom, Deputy Assistant Mikhail Markovich Verakov.” Davey barely hid the smile that flittered onto his face as we clapped for the man who entered the room. He was old, in his sixties and looked older yet. Verakov had straight, white hair that oddly enough reminded me of Davey’s hair as he grew older in the last timeline. Almost, looking at this man, I could believe he was Davey’s real father. The only thing was, I knew for a fact that Davey was the son of David Jones Sr. There could never be any doubt of that in my mind. “I understand this class has asked questions on how the Five-Year plan handles consumer products.” Verakov said, in Russian of course. His eyes were latched onto Davey already, and the entire time he spoke, his eyes never wandered far from my husband, even when others were asking questions. His answers, truth to tell, were not very illuminating, and certainly nothing important enough that the U.S. government would itch to know, but at the end of the class, when all the other students were leaving, Comrade Verakov made his move. “Comrade Jones, can you give me a moment of your time, please?” Verakov asked politely, and several other students paused to look at Davey before pushing past him. “You may remember, we met several weeks ago.” “I remember, sir.” Davey said politely. Verakov’s gaze flickered in recognition that I was standing behind and slightly to the right of Davey. “This would be your friend, Brian Breckenridge.” Verakov stated, more than asked. “I understand the two of you often come as a pair.” “True.” Davey said while trying not to laugh at the double entendre of those words. The slight flutter of Verakov’s lips made me wonder if maybe he’d intended them that way. Every time I’d seen the man so far, his eyes had looked haunted, but now, there was something else there. “What can we do for you, sir?” “Please, call me Mikhail.” The older man said politely. “I was curious. Where are you from?” “I attend Arizona State University.” Davey answered. “No, no, I know which school you attend, but where were you born?” Verakov asked. “I was born in Modesto, California.” Davey said. “My family still lives there. It is a small town, about 136 kilometers south of Sacramento, the state capitol.” “I know where this Modesto is located.” Verakov’s voice was tight now. “My son was born there.” “Seriously?” Davey said in a tone that expressed disbelief. “Yes, yes, in January of 1967.” The man said in a very sad tone. “Ya Tojhe!” Davey exclaimed excitedly, ‘me too’. “Come, we will eat lunch together.” Verakov said and he paused with a look towards me. “Your comrade as well.” “Uh…” That came out in English from Davey and he looked at me with a slightly worried expression. Maybe he should have become an actor, because he even had me fooled. “Do not worry, it will be okay with those who might worry.” Verakov said in a kindly, almost fatherly way. “Come, both of you, I believe you will enjoy this lunch.” It was barely an hour and a half after breakfast, and nowhere near lunch time, but we followed the man out of the building and into a waiting car. There was a uniformed driver to hold the door open for us, and we both got slightly nervous looks on our faces as we joined the man in the back seat. “One of the privileges of serving the Rodina.” He said with a soft sigh as the vehicle drove off. “Tell me of your parents, David Davidovich.” Davey talked, in Russian, talking about his parents, his father’s early career as a preacher, now abandoned in favor of business. Their constant moving when he was younger, his sister, and so on until he talked about being advanced in schooling so that we finished high school at sixteen. Verakov rarely interrupted, and I realized we were outside Moscow as Davey talked about graduating and beginning Arizona State. That was when he looked out the windows at a large monument we were passing. “What is that? Where are we?” “We are outside Moscow.” Verakov said and Davey got a worried look on his face. I hoped my expression looked as genuine. “That is the monument built to honor the place where Heroes of the Soviet Union stopped the Nazi pigs in the Great War.” “We aren’t supposed to leave Moscow…” Davey said in a worried tone the monument faded from view. “You are authorized for today.” Verakov said firmly. “We will be in my dacha soon, in the foothills, where we will eat lunch. Tell me Brian Emmetovich, what about your family? Were you born in Modesto as well?” “Yes, even the same hospital as Davey, but a week later.” I answered, and now it was my turn to tell my life’s story. He nodded politely, but clearly was not as interested in me as he was in Davey. Several times his hand lifted, as if to touch Davey, but he put it back down in his lap until we pulled up in front of a medium-sized house, more like a cabin or lodge, in a wooded area. After the driver opened the door, we followed him inside the dacha. It was fairly spacious, and well-made. The wood walls were covered in pictures, and the furniture looked comfortable, if slightly worn. He showed us into what looked like a living room, with a fireplace, empty in the heat of summer, and we sat on a couch while he sat near us in an armchair. “My wife, Ilianya.” He said with a wave of a hand to a picture on the mantle of the fireplace. “She passed away several years ago. Dmitry was heartbroken, as was I.” “My condolences.” Davey said softly in Russian. “You speak Russian well, for someone not born Russian.” Verakov complimented Davey who blushed at the praise. “You said your son was born in Modesto?” Davey asked. “Your wife and you were visiting?” “My wife and I never journeyed to the United States.” Verakov said sadly. “Then how…” Davey started to ask, but Verakov stood up and went to the picture of his wife, looking at it fondly. “No matter how we tried, we never did have children.” Verakov began his story in a sad tone. “During the Great War, I worked in a factory at Samarra. After the war, I became a manager, and from there was promoted quickly. Several years before you, and my son were born, I was promoted to work with the Foreign Office on issues of Trade. While there, I spent many long weeks away from my wife. “No matter my excuses, I was unfaithful to my wife.” He sounded like he truly regretted that. “I love her, loved her, very much, but that was not enough to keep me from straying. Mina was a lovely girl, and she was ambitious. When she found I would not leave my wife for her, she helped her brother defect to the United States and joined him there. When it happened, I did not know she was pregnant with my child, my children.” “Children?” Davey asked. “I thought you said you had a son.” “She died in your Modesto, giving birth to my son, Dmitry.” Verakov continued in a very flat tone as he looked over at another picture, of the now-dead Dmitry. He picked it up and crossed the room to hand it to Davey. “Dmitry had a twin, who I was told died in childbirth, along with Mina.” “He’s a handsome man.” Davey said cautiously while I looked over his shoulder at the picture. “He looks like you Davey.” I said with what I hoped sounded like genuine surprise. “Yes, I believe were he alive today he would look much like you.” Verakov said with a look of anticipation in his eyes, and a look of pain. “If he were alive?” Davey asked. “He died in an accident over a year ago.” Verakov’s eyes were slightly wet. “The doctors tried, but could not save him.” “It’s amazing how much he looks like me.” Davey said. “Yes.” Verakov agreed again. “I think there is a reason for that.” “My parents…” Davey began cautiously. “When I was twelve, I believed I was…what is the word? Adopted.” Verakov had to correct him on the word he used, or at least the correct tense, but Davey just nodded. “Yes, adopted.” Davey continued. “They are both shorter than I was at that age, and have dark hair and dark eyes. I look very little like them. They showed me my birth papers, showing I was their son.” “Papers like that can be forged.” Verakov said flatly. “When I saw you, it was like looking at my Dmitry again. You have a smile much like him.” “But I’m not exactly like him.” Davey said as he looked at the picture. “We look similar, but not the same.” “Not all twins look exactly alike.” Verakov answered. “There is a way we can tell with much more certainty.” “You think I’m…how would they have done that?” Davey asked. “Mayhap the woman you know as mother did give birth, but the child died during or right after birth.” Verakov said slowly. “That is very possible, and Mina died after giving birth to two boys, fraternal twins. She wanted her children to live in the United States, with her brother. This way at least one child would do that.” “Who’s her brother?” Davey asked. “I don’t know any Russians in Modesto.” “You would know him as Mr. Rush, father of your friend, Trevor.” Verakov said and we looked at him with mock surprise. He smiled at us. “Yes, since I first saw you I have been asking many questions, and our intelligence services have found many answers very quickly. I know much about you, David, and your… friend next to you. Do you know why your CIA refused your application to work there?” “No.” Davey whispered with wide eyes. “It is because the two of you are… to be polite, involved.” Verakov said without showing any discomfort. “It is not something appreciated in the Rodina, either, but for those with enough rank, their children are often allowed their own… pleasures. I do not… approve, but we do not shun you because of that. We would not have known if your government had not found out and rejected you for their service.” “You know our government would be interested in knowing that you were able to find this out.” I said with narrowed eyes and he smiled at me. “Yes, they would.” He said with a shrug. “You may tell them, if you wish, as long as you agree to some things.” “What things?” Davey asked suspiciously. “What do you think of a government that would hide a son from his father?” Verakov asked. “We don’t know if I’m the other son.” Davey stated flatly. “I will have a doctor here soon who will give us a preliminary test first.” Verakov said with a wave of his hand. “It will at least tell us if it is possible that we are related. A more detailed test will be taken later. All I ask is that you agree to take the first test. If it proves we cannot be related, you will be free to go.” “You mean to test the type of his blood.” I said calmly. “Yes.” Verakov replied. “What if it says we might be related?” Davey asked. “Your classes here end in two weeks.” Verakov stated. “That is correct.” Davey confirmed. “The test will take at least three weeks.” Verakov said. “If the first says it is possible, I will ask you to stay until the second test is done. Please understand, I am an old man. If you are my second son, stolen from me on the day you were born, you are all the family I have left.” “I already have a family.” Davey said flatly. “They love me. Do you expect me to turn my back on them?” “No.” Verakov said stonily. “But, they are only your family because you were stolen from me!” “If I am your son.” Davey insisted. “If.” Verakov allowed. “Please, as I said. I am an old man. My family is gone. If you are indeed my second son, I would like to get to know you.” “What about Brian?” Davey asked defensively. “As long as you visit with me, he is welcome.” Verakov said. “Do not… flaunt yourselves and no one will say anything or do anything to either of you.” “I almost wish I could be your son.” Davey said softly as he looked at the picture of Dmitry again. “I always wondered what it would be like to have a brother. No, I do not think I am your son.” “We will see.” Verakov said firmly. “Now, are you hungry? Let me show you my home.” In the United States, it might have been considered a slightly above-average place, but by the standards we’d seen in Moscow, the place was quite spacious. In addition to the driver who waited with the car, there was also a housekeeper/cook who took care of the home for the elderly man. Lunch was the best food we’d eaten since coming to Moscow, if you didn’t count a few of the parties we’d attended. Verakov might not be at the top of the ‘elite’ of Soviet society, but he was rather far up the ladder. After lunch was when a doctor came, with a syringe. Davey barely winced as the man took two samples of blood before doing the same with Verakov. Ten minutes later, he and Verakov were holding a hushed discussion just out of earshot. It wasn’t long before Verakov escorted the doctor over to where I sat with Davey, looking out the windows of the living room at the woods behind the house. “Your blood type is within expected range of Comrade Verakov’s.” The doctor said in a thick accent that I recognized now as being Ukrainian. His words were really unnecessary because for the first time since we’d met him, Verakov was smiling. An American wouldn’t recognize it quite as a smile, but for a Russian he might as well have been grinning from ear to ear. “It is possible the two of you are related. Your samples will be taken to a facility in Moscow where we will run further tests. The results will take at least three weeks.” “Thank you, comrade doctor.” Davey said with barely a nod of his head. Verakov himself escorted the middle-aged man out while Davey shared a look with me. My lover reached out and touched the back of my hand, quickly tapping out a message in Morse code. When we had known exactly what type of game the Agency wanted us to play here, we had thought of ways to communicate that couldn’t be overheard by microphones, caught by camera, or intercepted and read. In the end, we’d come up with tapping out messages with fingers against skin, hidden from view. It wasn’t perfect, and long messages took a while, but at least we could ‘talk’ without others hearing. ‘Do we?’ Davey asked in his tapping. Four letters with the interrogative quite clear from the look on his face. “You pick.” I tapped back quickly as Verakov reentered the room. My eyes told Davey, even as our hands separated that I would support him in whatever decision he made. A little voice inside of me was saying that Davey was having doubts about trying to fool this man. Not likely because we couldn’t do it, but rather because he was a nice man who had been given a series of hard blows by fate. I knew Davey, and his conscious had to be tearing him up inside. “If you wish to have another doctor confirm this, I can make sure it is arranged.” Verakov said calmly to Davey as we looked up at him. “I…I can’t believe this is happening.” Davey said quietly. “It is hard to believe. How do you know it is not a trick? Maybe… maybe the CIA is trying to trick you, or both of us.” “They would not be interested in the likes of me.” Verakov said with a snort. “I know nothing of military secrets. My work is in determining what our factories can produce, and not even our military factories. What does the West care how many cars we can make, or how many radios, or how many cooking pans for our wives to use?” “You would be surprised how important those things can be.” Davey said with a sigh, but Verakov shook his head. “No, it is not likely.” Verakov said with a look at me. “The Americans do not trust boys like you. They believe our evil agents will seduce you and use you for our own evil designs.” The look on his face as he said that, and the tone of his voice is what caused both Davey and I to laugh slightly. Verakov’s smile reappeared on his face, little more than the edges of his lips quirking up, but combined with the look in his eyes, it was easy to understand he was feeling happy. That caused a slight feeling of guilt but I pushed that aside. No matter my feelings about doing this, no matter whether it was a waste of time or not, we were expected to perform a duty here, and I would perform that duty well. “What happens now?” Davey asked in a quiet voice. “Do you expect me to call you father?” “No.” Verakov said as he sat down in his armchair again. “Now, I believe, you should return to University. You have both missed most of your classes today. I would expect my son, and his friend, to earn good marks in class. You have the weekend off. I know your group was planning several tours, and to see the ballet. If you do not mind, instead you will come here. Until we have the results of the final test, we will learn about each other.” “What about after?” Davey asked. “We’re supposed to leave in a few weeks.” “After your classes are done, you will be invited to stay with me.” Verakov said calmly. “We have missed eighteen years and have much to catch up on.” “What if I want to go back to the United States?” Davey asked. “I am an American you know. I was born there, raised there.” “Yes, you were born there, and raised there, but you are also Russian.” The man said sternly. He was tense, but relaxed slightly as he took a deep breath. “You are an adult. From you was stolen the opportunity to know your brother. He would have liked you. I suspected he was like you, you know, preferring boys to girls, but he never said anything.” “My parents don’t really know, either.” Davey said with a rueful chuckle. “They keep asking when I’m going to date a girl.” “Ah, I see.” Verakov said slowly. “You will never have to hide anything from me. I am lucky to have this chance to know you, and would rather know you as you are instead of as my dreams would make you. Just knowing you will be enough for me. That is all I ask. Spend time with me, allow me to get to know you, and you me. If, after some time has passed, you wish to return, you will be able to return to the United States. If, as I hope, you choose to stay here, you will attend Moscow State, and you will find many opportunities open for you in the Soviet Union. We are not the villains your government would have you believe we are.” “I–I can do that much.” Davey said with a sigh. “Brian?” “I’m not going anywhere without you.” I said to him and Verakov nodded. “I will look forward to getting to know you too.” Verakov said. “I confess I am confused. I always thought among your kind one of you had to be the woman and one the man, but you both look fine young men.” “Oh god, how do we talk about this in Russian?” Davey asked in English as he laughed quietly. “Very, very carefully.” I answered him in the same language before shifting back to Russian. “I think we will all have a lot to learn.” Poor Professor Vernon was fit to be tied when we arrived back on the Moscow State campus. He was pacing back and forth in front of a building when the vehicle we were riding in came to a stop near him. The uniformed driver got out, opened the door for us and the Professor gaped at us as we got out. Unfortunately for us, the vehicle had barely pulled away before he started in on the two of us. “What is going on here?” He screamed in Russian. “Where have you been? Who was in that car?” “We were invited to visit a relative.” Davey said calmly and the man stopped his ranting to stare at Davey. “Who are you related to?” He asked in English. “Apparently to Comrade Verakov.” Davey answered with a shake of his head. We left the good Professor standing there, gaping with a mouth wide open as we entered the barracks that we called home here. There were a lot of questions from our fellow students, but we managed to brush them off while working on the ‘assignments’ that we had missed. We tapped out a rather long discussion, our longest yet that night. Davey shared my concerns about the old man. He, like me, felt bad for deceiving him, but was not deterred. If he was younger, had not lived at least part of one lifetime already, he would have been facing a bigger moral quandary, but he had learned some simple truths that most people learned as they got older. Very rarely were opponents, or enemies, ‘bad’ people. They are merely people, human beings with good traits, and bad traits. Their actions can be bad, or evil even, but those actions do not necessarily make the individual themselves ‘bad’. Davey’s father was a prime example. His molesting his daughter was an act of evil. That alone did not make him a bad person. In a timeline where that was prevented, Davey’s father ended up being one of the best Presidents in United States history. In this timeline, he was fast becoming an important businessman, achieving great things. Davey could understand that Verakov might be a nice old man, worthy of sympathy, and maybe even respect for the things he had achieved in life. Still, by his actions, he was a person contributing to a bad system of government. His contributions propped up a government that abused its own people, and threatened the liberties of people all over the world. Men who held certain beliefs in what a government should, and should not be for its people founded the United States. They rebelled against a near-tyrannical King and Parliament in order to establish a government that had, at its core, certain beliefs. The Declaration of Independence stated it best: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Davey and I both understood these core principles, and knew that the Soviet system of government was wrong. That was why it had to fail, as history had already determined it time and again. Making sure that it happened again in this timeline was a worthy goal, even if it meant deceiving a nice old man who had suffered great loss already. Classes the next day were interesting in several ways. Our fellow American students were still burning up with curiosity about what had happened with us the day before. The Soviet Professors treated Davey, and me to a lesser extent, with a little more respect. How much did they know? What had they been told? Or were they just reacting to us leaving and returning in a government vehicle? Thursday afternoon, Professor Karesova invited us to attend a meeting of the campus Party with her. Professor Vernon’s eyebrows shot through his fading hairline when he was told we would be attending with her. The meeting itself reminded me more of a Bible Study than anything else. An older man ‘preached’ about the historic dialectic and its inevitable victory over capitalism. Davey and I received several side-long looks from those there, mostly faculty, but remained silent for the most part. We did remember to thank Karesova for inviting us afterwards though. On Friday, we’d no sooner walked out of our last classroom than a young man in Soviet uniform met us. He was very polite in inviting us to follow him, and he led us to a waiting vehicle much like the one we’d ridden in earlier in the week. He even held the door open for us as we got inside. There was no one waiting inside for us, but the young soldier got into the driver’s seat and quickly sped off campus. Neither of us relaxed until we passed the monument we’d seen last time, and were certain we were heading for Verakov’s dacha. I wasn’t sure about Davey, but this whole spy business was just a little bit hard on my nerves. When it was all over, I was going to make sure we never did anything like this again. Chapter 25 “I do not think you understand the importance of being able to dream of a better life.” Davey said to his ‘father’ as we rode in the car back into Moscow. For the past week we’d stayed in the dacha while the old man took the time ‘off’ from work. Not that he did no work. He had an office in the dacha, and spent many hours on the phone when he was not entertaining the two of us. It had now been a few days more than three weeks since that first trip out to the dacha, and we were now heading back into Moscow for the official ‘results’ of the test. Davey and I were both nervous, since we couldn’t see how the CIA would have been able to fake those results. “You do not understand the importance of knowing your place in life, and being assured that you will have safety and security when you are old and infirm.” Verakov countered Davey’s assertion. “What good are silken dreams when they do not put food on your table or a roof over your head?” “What good is a roof over your head when you know your children will never achieve more than you have?” Davey retorted. This particular argument had been raging for two days now, and both of them were enjoying it immensely. If I had to be honest, I was enjoying it too. “In America you can have both.” I added my voice to the argument, drawing looks from both of them. There were smiles on both their faces. The truth was I liked Verakov, probably more than I liked this timeline’s version of Davey’s father. “Social security guarantees the elderly will have money in their retirement, although they do not have to depend on that alone. They can save, have their own pensions to supplement what they get from the state. If they are smart enough to purchase their own home while they are working, they will have paid it off by the time they retire, and are even more free to enjoy the fruits of a life of labor.” “But you have millions of homeless.” Verakov pounced with a wolfish smile. “Millions of your elderly, and your mentally ill roam your streets and sleep in doorways while trying to stay warm! Your Social Security does not save them!” “There is no homelessness in the Soviet Union?” Davey shot back. “None worth mentioning.” Verakov snorted. “Again, I ask what use are there dreams of yours when you can not feed your hungry or shelter your homeless?” “How much grain is being imported this year from the United States?” I asked and the man blinked at me before laughing. “No system is perfect, but we are getting there.” He countered with a slight shrug. It was true the Soviet Union imported grain every year from the United States. Their collective farming system was…inefficient in the extreme. They should have been able to grow enough food to feed their own people, but they didn’t. In some cases, it wasn’t the collectives that were the problem though. Some grew more than enough food, but that food rotted in storage because there were no trucks to take it where it was needed. It was facts like these that had ultimately led to the fall of the Soviet Union, and while we might argue about them with Verakov, we didn’t want them to change anytime soon. In less than six months, the beginning of the end would happen for the Soviet Union with the first elections in Hungary and Poland. Then the Berlin Wall would fall, and within two years of that, the Soviet Union would cease to exist. An idea was beginning to form in my head, an avenue of opportunity that had never been available to us before, but was now opening. One of the things my original Davey had always tried to change was the fallout of the Soviet collapse. He had achieved some success with that in my original timeline. Sean had told me that I had been less successful in the last timeline. Maybe, just maybe, this opportunity here with Verakov could be translated into better success down the road. “Not even the United States is perfect.” Davey admitted with a shrug of his own and Verakov nodded. “Too many people are too blinded by their patriotism to see the need for improvement in their own system of government.” Verakov stated flatly. “Maybe they fear being arrested here.” I added in as a jibe and Verakov frowned at me. “For some that is a concern, but not for those who belong to the Party and seek to further the goals of the Party.” Verakov’s voice was flat as he spoke. “To look at the Party with a critical eye, seeking to improve the dialectic is the responsibility of all Party members. We are here.” “Amazing.” Davey said as we got out of the car and looked around at the Kremlin. We had been to Red Square when we first arrived, and seen the Tomb of Lenin with its long line of tourists, but to actually be in front of the working Kremlin, where the Soviet Union, and later the Russian Federation were governed was absolutely amazing. “Do you actually work here?” “No, my offices are nearby, not in the Kremlin itself.” Verakov said kindly. “Come, you have your papers?” “Da.” Davey said as he pulled the green passbook from his suit pocket. We were both wearing our best suits today. Davey’s passbook was new, something given to him just last week by Verakov. I had received a similar one. Neither were our American passports. These were documents that actually allowed us more freedom in Moscow than most of its own citizens enjoyed. A middle-aged officer looked them over carefully before allowing us entry into the building itself. Walking through the building was different than walking through the Capitol in Washington, or even the White House. Those buildings were full of history, and you knew they were the center of power for a mighty government, but the Kremlin had even more history, and at times like now, just as much power. It was more ostentatious, and in a way more humbling. We were led to a room deep in the Kremlin, where Verakov introduced us to Yuri Maslyukov, his ‘superior’. I recognized his name as the head of the State Planning Committee, and was surprised because I had been led to believe that Verakov worked for a different branch of the government. The State Planning Committee was responsible for implementing the long-range economic plans of the Soviet Union, and was one of their most important economic bodies. “They are waiting for the two of you.” Maslyukov stated after polite words had been exchanged, and Verakov led Davey into another room while I remained, as it was clearly intended with Maslyukov. When they were gone, the man turned to me, looking me over twice before speaking again. “Walk with me.” “Yes, comrade.” I said with a slight nod as he led the way out of the room and back down the hallway of the Kremlin. “In that room, a doctor and an official from the Foreign Office are telling your friend and mine that the young man is indeed the lost twin son.” Maslyukov said in Russian after we had turned a corner. He stopped walking and gave me a very direct look. “It is of course, a lie.” “Excuse me?” I exclaimed in English and he nodded before starting to walk again. I had to hurry a few steps to catch up. “Why are they telling them this if it is a lie?” “Mika has worked hard for the Rodina all of his life.” Maslyukov stated in a matter-of-fact tone. “The Rodina likes to repay those who serve it, and the last few years have not been kind to him. For the last year, his work has not been as it should, and I was considering replacing him. It was only a few months ago that I took this position, and we have important work to accomplish. I need him, his knowledge, and his skills, but only if he is able to work hard. Your… friend has given new life to him. Mika believes the boy is his son, and his work the last few weeks has never been better.” “Then why are you telling me the truth?” I asked him with incredulity. So the CIA hadn’t been able to fake the test. But… how did they get this result? Or did they just expect it to happen and hope for the best? My incredulity was real right now. “You are both very smart young men.” Maslyukov began his explanation with a compliment. “The fact that the two of you are perverts would normally be a barrier, but in this case we will overlook this fact.” “Why?” I asked directly and got a direct answer. “Mika, with his new son at hand, will do valuable work for several more years before he retires.” Maslyukov’s answer was simple. “When he retires, you can tell your friend the truth, and the two of you can return to your country, or stay. If you stay, honorable work will be found for the both of you, and as long as you do not make your perversion public, we will overlook it and not punish you as the law requires. In staying, at least until Mika retires, you will live comfortably and have the gratitude of the Soviet people.” “Aren’t you worried we might be spies?” I asked him, just to see his response. “Nyet.” He snorted in the negative. “You are too young, although we do know you wished to work for the CIA but were rejected. Mika has already told you we know this.” “I don’t want to give up my American citizenship.” I stated flatly. “I do not think Davey will either. I do know I will want to be able to visit my family from time to time.” “All that is being arranged.” Malsyukov stated. “You will both be granted diplomatic passports. The American State Department does not wish an international incident, although they deny any switch in babies was ever made.” “They’re right.” I reminded him and he chuckled. “But we will never tell them that.” He replied. “Sergei Mikhailovich, as your friend is being told his real name should be, will be granted Soviet citizenship. You will be a legal resident of the Soviet Union. Tomorrow you will visit the American Ambassador and tell him that these arrangements are acceptable to you. Both of you will be granted visas to return to the United States for a few weeks each year, and naturally any foreign vacations you take with Mika will be permitted. When Mika is retired, you will tell your friend, but not before! Then you may decide whether to stay, or leave forever.” “Why are you doing this?” I asked him sharply, and with a deliberately suspicious tone. “You believe the Soviet Union is this gigantic creature that does not care about its people.” Maslyukov stated flatly. “You are wrong. You Americans claim your government, what is the phrase? Oh yes, ‘Of the people, by the people, for the people’ but it is not the people your government serves, it is your economy. We run our economy so that it serves the needs of our people, not some corporations or a select few. Spend the next few years learning the true Soviet Union, not the villain your propaganda has shown you. We truly care for our people, and Mika has served us long and faithfully. In some ways, we have failed him. Our doctors failed to cure his wife of cancer, but then even your doctors often fail with that. Americans die all the time in accidents like that which took the life of Dmitry Mikhailovich. The difference is that we will give him something to replace those losses.” “By lying to him.” I stated and he chuckled again. I realized that we were essentially walking in a big circle as we passed the doorway that led to the room where Davey was right now. “Some lies are not wrong.” Malsyukov shrugged. “Some lies can do more good than harm. Do you not lie to your parents about your relationship with Sergei Mikhailovich?” “My parents know.” I said with a shrug. “His do not.” It was a statement, not a question. Yes, Davey had told Verakov that. “No, they don’t.” I stated. “Why not?” Maslyukov asked. “They wouldn’t understand it.” I said sourly. “So for you two, telling the lie to them is okay?” He asked with another chuckle. “When is a lie acceptable to you and when is it not?” “We’ll be lying to them when we tell them this story is true.” I stated and he nodded. “It will hurt them a lot.” “Will they not hurt when they learn their son will never give them grandchildren?” Maslyukov retaliated, and I had to smile at his persistence. He was right of course. Everyone lied, and we always believed our reasons for lying were valid, even necessary. “I am not Russian, or Soviet, or Communist.” I said with a shrug. “Why should I care to help you maintain your form of government?” “Ah, a real question at last.” Malsyukov said. “We will give you and your friend a comfortable life, more comfortable than you would have in the United States even.” “I don’t care about that.” I said with a shake of my head. “You are not interested in money?” He asked with a raised eyebrow. “Are you sure you are American?” “We can have all that in the United States.” I answered. “Then what if I were to tell you that you and Sergei Mikhailovich have broken Soviet law?” He said in a sterner voice. “You can be sent to the gulag for five years for the things you have done in the bedroom of Mika’s dacha. Not even your State Department would seek to stop such a sentence.” “You will lose Verakov’s services if you do that.” I retorted. “We will lose him anyway, to depression, if you do not cooperate.” He countered. That should be enough protesting to make it look real. “Okay.” I said after meeting his stare for several minutes. “As I said before, you are a smart young man.” Malsyukov said more jovially, clapping me on the shoulder. “Now, why don’t you join your friend and his father? Remember, he must believe what he has been told.” “I won’t tell him the truth, not until Verakov retires.” I said firmly and the man nodded once before opening the door for me. Davey was sitting in the room, in a chair next to Verakov, but smiled and leapt to his feet when he saw me. “Brian, it’s true!” He said in a tone of disbelief, but there was a smile on his face. “Can you believe it?” “I don’t know what to believe.” I answered in Russian. “This sounds like some story out of a Tom Clancy novel.” “Pravda.” Davey agreed with a chuckle. Verakov also stood and turned to face me. “Let me introduce you to my son, Sergei Mikhailovich.” Verakov said with a hand on Davey’s shoulder. “That is the name we would have given him if he had come to us, as he should have, eighteen years ago.” “I understand.” I said calmly. “What happens now?” “I don’t know.” Davey said with a frown. “How am I going to tell Mom and Dad? And Jenny? Do we stay here?” “I would like to get to know my son, if you are willing.” Verakov said firmly. “Both of you will always be welcome in my home.” “The Soviet Union will welcome one of its own sons home, and his friend.” The older man who was in the room said gravely. “I am Yuri Andreiich Nerov, from Foreign Affairs. We have already spoken with the American State Department. I believe you have been told of the agreements made, if this remains quiet and out of the Western media?” “Yes.” I agreed. “What do you think, Brian?” Davey asked me in English. “He says we can attend Moscow State for our degrees, if we wish. We’ll even have an apartment near campus, together! They will honor our credits from Arizona State.” “I’ll do whatever you want.” I said simply. “You should get to know him better if he really is your father.” “I think… it’s not like we won’t be able to go back.” Davey said. “I just don’t look forward to telling Mom and Dad.” “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” I replied in English and he nodded. “Come, this calls for a celebration.” Nerov said as he walked over to a low credenza with several bottles on it. He poured Vodka of course, and we all toasted father and son. Two nights later we were at the U.S. Embassy in a rather uncomfortable situation. At first two mid-level State Department officials grilled us over and over again on what was really going on, and on our decision to stay in the USSR. Then the ambassador himself got us alone in his office and pulled out the big guns. The long-distance telephone call to Davey’s parents, and then my parents, was anything but comfortable. They wanted us home, especially Davey’s parents who didn’t understand why he wouldn’t believe that they knew he was their son. This whole situation was stressful to them, and Davey knew through our secret tapping system that the test results were really a lie. Fooling his parents wasn’t easy, and it was only the promise of a visit over Christmas that kept them from going to the media immediately. Verakov took us to the Black Sea resort that was the favorite of members of the Politburo and their senior staff. Whatever his humble beginnings, Uncle Mikhail, as he insisted I call him, was one of the elite of Soviet society now, and lived a fairly comfortable life. Even while relaxing on the beaches of the Black Sea, though, he was working and Davey and I learned a lot about his work just from overheard conversations. We learned even more from the philosophical conversations that Davey had with the man while we settled into life in his dacha. The man was intent on convincing Davey that communism was the right way to govern a society, and Davey was proving a capable debater. He deftly steered their discussions into areas where the man actually revealed quite a bit about economic production in the Soviet Union, and the problems they faced. Occasionally I would get involved in the conversations, but I tended to give ground easier than Davey did. When classes began again at Moscow State, we were enrolled the same as any other students, or at least any other students of the elite. The required courses on Marxism-Leninism were non-negotiable, as were the math requirements harsher than their American counterparts. Davey was chagrined to learn he would be taking more math than he would have at Arizona State. Then there was the fact that everyone now called him Sergei. Even I called him by that name, only using his real name when we were having sex. It took him two weeks into the semester until he answered to it as he would to his real name. My name was also ‘russianized’, with people taking to calling me Yuri for some reason. I never quite got the connection, but Davey insisted that if he had to go by Sergei, I would answer to Yuri. When December rolled around, we learned just how cold a Russian winter could be. Both of us were happy to get on the Aeroflot flight that would eventually take us back to California. It was a long flight, with a stopover in Japan before we landed in San Francisco where both of our parents met us. His folks whisked him away with barely a word for me, while my mother kept on touching me to make sure I was really there. “What is really going on, Brian?” Dad asked when we were in the car and driving back towards Modesto. Davey had called, and written his parents every week, just as I had done, and their responses had become more and more distressful as time went by. Mikhail Verakov had not been happy to let us go, but seemed confident we would return. “You were told about Davey’s birth.” I answered in English that was actually a bit rusty. “Don’t tell me you believe that story?” Mom snorted. “Does it matter if we do or not?” I asked. “The Russians do, and Verakov believes it. You know how bad the story would make our government look if it ever got out. It’s just easier to let things happen this way. It’s not like they’re going to make Davey live there forever.” “What do you mean?” Dad asked. “And that’s Davey. Why are you staying?” “Would you leave Mom?” I asked him with a snort and he shook his head. “As for what I mean, well, when Davey and I graduate from college, things will change. Verakov will have gotten to know Davey for a few years, and he’ll be less… needy is the word I think. He’s just asked Davey for a few years to get to know him. He’s lost all his family you know.” “That doesn’t mean he has a right to take other people’s family.” Mom said sternly. I could only imagine what Davey was getting. “Well, both you and Davey have appointments with psychologists who specialize in dealing with Stockholm Syndrome. We’ll get you set right.” “You think we were taken hostage?” I asked, surprised by my own parents. “What other explanation is there?” Mom said and I laughed. This was going to be fun. In the end, it was Trevor’s father who took both parents aside for several long conversations. When he was done with them, our parents gave us dirty looks, but didn’t protest when we packed our bags to return to Moscow. Davey’s parents were downright frosty to both of us, not even taking him to the airport. It was on the flight back I learned that they finally knew exactly what our relationship was, and they’d threatened him with being disowned if he didn’t dump me. Then they blamed my parents for the whole mess, and I wasn’t sure how that was going to affect the business they all operated as a group. Mika was happy to see Davey when we landed in Moscow. It was even colder than it had been when we left. Oddly, Davey looked more comfortable here than he had the entire time in California. This whole thing was going to take years to smooth over when everything was done. I’d left nearly two hundred pages of hastily typed notes for Mr. Rush before we left, and I hoped whatever information was in there was worth the cost Davey, and to a less extent, I, would be paying for this – emotional as well as physical. Twice over the next year, I met Alexei Shevardnadze. It was eerie standing in the same room with the person who had caused so much trouble in previous timelines. The scientist was dead, though, and there was no need to kill the Russian this time. Still, it was interesting to know that I could have done it if it was necessary. As 1989 progressed, the discussions between Mika and Davey became less and less frequent. If you read Pravda, or watched the government news, you might not know that Hungary and Poland had elected non-communist governments. Nor would you truly understand that the Berlin Wall no longer existed. Still, news of those events percolated on the campus of Moscow State, and on the streets of the city itself. Knowing what was coming, and seeing the effects of those events on the populace was interesting. The signs were everywhere of the cracks in the foundations of the Soviet Union if you knew what to look for, but its leadership went along like nothing had changed. That year I went home for two weeks in the summer, and had several long talks with Mr. Rush, as well as leaving him a two-hundred page book on everything Davey and I were observing. In those notes were predictions that within the next few years, major changes would be seen in Soviet government. They didn’t come right out and say the Soviet Union was going to crack like an egg, but they hinted at it. That summer, we went to Samarra with Mika, and Davey got to meet several ‘cousins’ that still lived in the region. It was a closed region, where few if any Westerners had ever visited, and when I went back for Christmas, again alone, Mr. Rush seemed quite enthralled with my notes from the visit there. 1990 was going to be a long year for the Soviet Union, and I had front-row seats with Davey for the excitement. The 1988 reforms of Gorbachev, allowing for the first time since 1922 private property, private ownership of business and manufacturing plants were starting to have their effect on the national economy. Mika was at the heart of the storm, and while we stayed in the Moscow apartment that had been provided, we barely saw him during the week. On the weekends he looked like he was aging every week, growing older and older. Davey took to worrying over his health more than anything else. One thing I’d always underestimated was the news programs. As time went by, the reforms of Gorbachev relaxed the Communist party control over the media. For the first time, the Soviet people were learning some of the sordid history of their nation. From Stalin’s purges to the abysmally high suicide rate, information that had been kept from them was becoming public, and shaking the faith of the average citizen on the street. Since the early days of the cold war, the United States had tried telling Soviet citizens about these atrocities and problems, but their broadcasts reached few people inside the nation, and were believed by even fewer. Several of those we met who were near our age group could sing every song by American (and British) rock bands that they heard over the pirate American broadcasts, but would laugh about stories of Stalin’s atrocities, until they heard about it on Moscow news. By the time we were ready to graduate with our degrees from Moscow State, I was quite certain that I wanted to stay and watch this all the way through. It was still winter outside, and there was a lot of snow on the ground when we went to a dinner at Mika’s house. Maslyukov was there, with his wife, as were several other apparatchiks who worked with the two men. It was a semi-formal affair, but the discussion took a surprising turn after the dinner itself was over, and we sat in a room sipping cognac in front of the fire. “Do you know what our work is right now?” Maslyukov asked Davey and I after taking a puff on his cigarette. So far Davey and I had both resisted taking up smoking, which all these men did with relish. “I have a few thoughts.” Davey admitted. “There is much privatization of businesses going on now and you play some role in that.” “We are supposed to be supporting the private ownership of business and manufacturing while still maintaining control.” Maslyukov stated sourly. “It does not go well. Production is still down, and our economy worsens instead of improves.” “Maybe you have the wrong people buying the businesses.” Davey said quickly, hitting a key point I’d shared with him about the problems of post-Soviet Russia. “What do you mean?” Maslyukov asked. “Who is buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “Those with the resources to do so, Sergei.” Mika stated with a chuckle. “You know this already, or should.” “Yes, but why are they buying these businesses?” Davey asked him. “What is their motivation for owning them?” “To make money.” Maslyukov, a true communist said it with a frown. “That is the problem. They do not care about the good of the nation, they care first about making more money.” “That is always the problem with capitalism, but it does work.” Davey said. “The problem is not just with production, it’s with distribution, which is still state-controlled, and it is with the ownership. Here in Moscow, the small restaurants and other types of businesses that are opening are flourishing. That is because they can buy the goods they need to sell, and because they live here. They care about not only making a profit, but doing right by their neighbors who are their customers. A person in Moscow who buys a factory in Samarra does not care about the people in Samarra. He cares about his factory making money.” “So how do you solve this?” Maslyukov asked with real interest. “No one in Samarra has money to buy the factory.” “No one.” Davey said with emphasis on the second word. “Establish a fund to help the workers in the factory take out a loan and collectively buy the factory. If the workers of the factory own it, depend on it for their lives, and receive back the fruits of their labor from dividend payments, they will work harder. They will vote to hire managers that know what they are doing, and get rid of those who do not.” “But that does not solve the transportation problems.” I added. “What good does it do to make more automobiles if you cannot move them to where people can afford to buy them?” “How would you improve our transportation, my young man American friend?” Maslyukov asked. Should I reply honestly, and take the risk of actually helping the Soviet Union? No, the suggestion would only speed up its end, or be a contributing factor to that end. “Much the same way as what Sergei suggested.” I explained. “Truck drivers do not care if they arrive on time if they are not being rewarded for their work. Enable them to achieve their own control over their own work. Establish a fund that will loan them the money to buy their own trucks. You won’t really be spending any more money than you already did to buy the truck the first time. You are just moving money around on paper. Charge them a little interest. They will own the truck, and be able to offer their services to those who have goods to move at a fair price. Monitor their prices, and those that cheat too much can be punished. In English we call it ‘gouging’. “But there isn’t really infrastructure to support all that.” Davey said with a sigh. “The roads are awful, and fueling stations are not all that common. They would have to be privatized too in order to make this work.” “That is the problem.” I agreed with him. “You cannot just turn one part of the economy into private business without also converting those that support such businesses. A puzzle is only little pieces until you put them all together to form a whole.” “Yes, it is as you have said, Mika.” Maslyukov said. “Looking at only one tree has blinded us to the whole forest.” “It is something we should think about.” Mika added, and the conversation changed to the weather and when we thought spring would finally arrive. By summer, Davey and I found ourselves in positions I had not expected: working as assistants to Mika. Certainly we were very junior, and watched very, very closely, but we found some of our suggestions actually being considered, and one or two implemented. I was certain they would not help strengthen the Soviet Union, but held my breath just the same. That summer Davey did not go back to America at all. His family was still not speaking to him, and my parents explained that David Jones Sr. had quit working for their budding corporation, even though he still owned a fair amount of stock. It wasn’t quite clear what he was doing, but he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. Mr. Rush was not alone when I went to visit him this time. Mr. Long was there as well, and I had a direct debriefing that summer that lasted almost all of the two weeks. I barely had time to spend a day with Trevor and Todd as well as Brandon and Sean, all of whom were busy with their own lives. Todd was working on movie sets, trying to become a director. Trevor was drafted by L.A. and playing professional football as a backup quarterback. Brandon and Sean were starting up their own computer firm and had settled in Massachusetts. Before I returned, there was one more meeting with Mr. Long, who told me to keep doing what we were doing. There were several people at the CIA who now believed it was entirely possible the Soviet Union could collapse any day now, and they were looking forward to seeing it become reality. He was even more excited about our new jobs, and was considering setting up a system whereby we could sneak information out more frequently. Davey was happy to see me when I returned, and he had a very worried look on his face as he met me at Moscow’s airport. “What’s wrong?” I asked him, switching back to Russian easily now. “It’s father.” Davey said with a frown as we walked to the waiting car. He had started calling Mika that last year. Never any shorter name, always ‘father’. “What is it?” I asked him. “He is in the hospital.” Davey said sadly. “The doctors say it is only a matter of time.” “I’m sorry.” I said as we got in the car. “Are we going to see him?” “Yes, he’s been asking for you.” Davey said with a slight smile. “He misses his ‘third’ son.” “I missed him too.” I said, and was only partly surprised at the truth of that statement. Chapter 26 We buried Mikhail Verakov twelve days after I returned to Moscow. Like so many other Russian men, he died from lung cancer and pneumonia. Over the last few years, I had seen the close bond that had developed between Davey and this man, and so I wasn’t surprised at how hard Davey took the man’s death. Mika was not Davey’s real father, and Davey knew that, but he loved the man anyway for a variety of reasons. Part of it had to do with the unconditional love that Mika had always given him. Even at its best, Davey’s relationships with his parents had always been conditioned by a variety of factors. They had certain expectations of him in every timeline, and he was constantly struggling with them in one way or another, even when they accepted him, and our relationship. He had to prove to them that he wasn’t a disappointment even though he was gay. With Mika, there had been none of that. The old man had accepted Davey, or Sergei as he’d always called Davey, as Davey was, without condition. Davey did not have to do anything to please the man, or to be loved by the man. All he had to do was be there. It was certainly a far easier relationship for Davey. Davey spoke at the funeral, which was attended by a lot more people than we had expected. It wasn’t a religious service of course, and many of the people were dignitaries of the Soviet government. After the funeral, we even spoke a few words with the Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev. That was quite an eye-opening experience for both of us since we had rarely even seen the man before and certainly never spoken to him directly. Davey and I didn’t speak about the future after the funeral, but rather I comforted him while he cried. I’d been there with him in my original timeline after his parents had each passed away, and knew he took these types of situations very hard. The future could wait while he grieved. We spent that night at Mika’s dacha out in the foothills instead of at our apartment. There, on the mantle over the fireplace, new pictures had been added in recent years, pictures of Mika and Davey, and even a few of me up there as well. In all of them, Mika’s lips were curled upwards. “You have a visitor, Sergei.” Lina, Mika’s older housekeeper said on the morning of the third day. Mika’s driver was no longer around, but she was still here, taking care of the house and helping to fix our meals while we stayed. She was a widower, and her children were grown and had families of their own now. Her work here had been a semi-retirement for her, and I idly wondered what would happen for her now. For that matter, what would happen with this house? “Who is it?” Davey asked in a soft voice. “Comrade Maslyukov is here.” She responded. “Please, bring him in.” Davey said quickly, turning from the picture on the fireplace and straightening his shirt. We were both wearing dark slacks, and Davey was in a white dress shirt while I was wearing a light green polo. Both of us straightened our hair a bit before heading down the stairs. “Comrade Maslyukov, welcome.” Davey said formally as we came into the living room. “Comrade Verakov, you have my condolences.” Maslyukov said with a short nod to Davey before he turned to me. “Comrade Breckenridge, you have honored our agreement over the last few years. I am here to honor my part now.” “You are referring to the fact that Comrade Verakov was not really my father.” Davey said calmly and Maslyukov shot me an accusing glare. “Please, Comrade, I knew from the beginning that he was not. Yuri did not have to tell me anything. I think in the end, even he knew that I was not his other son, but it did not matter. Family is more than blood, sometimes. Mika needed family, and he was a good man who deserved to have a family. I was honored to give him that.” “Interesting.” Maslyukov said as he sat down hard. Davey nodded and crossed to the small bar, pouring three shots of vodka and handing one to me before giving one to the older man. We toasted the memory of the departed and Maslyukov downed his quickly. “I liked him the first time I met him, and knew he was a good man.” Davey continued his explanation calmly. “He seemed so lonely, and did not deserve that. When I saw how he was able to accept me as I am, without judgment, I knew I would give him what he wanted: a son.” “This is a copy of his will.” Maslyukov said after he had digested Davey’s words. He took out a folded paper from his suit coat and handed it to Davey. “You will see that he has left you all of his possession. They are not as much as your American father has, but you can live comfortably in the USSR with this.” “Are we still welcome here?” Davey asked. “It is a fiction that I am a son of the Soviet Union.” “It is fiction, yes, but the records all say now that it is a fact.” Maslyukov shrugged. “If you wish to stay, if both of you wish to stay, you will be welcome. I am worried for the future.” “Why?” I asked, speaking for the first time in this conversation. Maslyukov held out the tumbler he had emptied, and waited while Davey filled it for him. The older man downed it again and looked out the large windows behind us and motioned for both Davey and I to sit. We did, sitting next to each other on the couch. “I fear the Union is crumbling.” Maslyukov’s voice was faint. When both Davey and I looked nervous he chuckled. “The listening devices were removed last year. Neither of you have said, or done, anything that our spies have disapproved. They were quite upset that you were not spies.” “There were no military secrets for us to steal.” Davey shrugged and Maslyukov chuckled again. “It is possible the American government has been looking in the wrong places for our secrets all these years.” Maslyukov stated in a sad tone. “I never thought to see the day when the Union would be crumbling. The Germans talk of reunification with the capitalist brothers. The European states talk of independence, and even the Baltic states are grumbling that they were once sovereign. I fear that only tanks and soldiers will keep them in the Union, and this is not the 1950’s. Gorbachev is not Kruschev, to crush them under his boots and force them to comply. As things stand now, the Union will not survive more than five years.” “I would give it two at most.” I said, taking a risk. Maslyukov gave me a hard look and then nodded abruptly. “That is a bet I will not take.” He grumbled. “You have proven to be quite intelligent, both of you.” “Thank you.” Davey said. “Sergei, I fear for what comes.” Maslyukov stated. “I wonder what will happen to the Rodina if the Union dissolves. Will we become capitalists only concerned about making more rubles and discard our principles?” “That is a possibility.” Davey said with a frown. “Mika and I had many conversations about the dangers of unfettered capitalism. I do not agree with communism, I believe you know that.” “Yes.” Maslyukov agreed. “Mika said you might make a socialist, but never a communist.” “True.” Davey agreed bluntly. “Even socialism though, does not work, in my belief. It is more accurate to say I believe in controlled capitalism. A field where any man may achieve his dreams, but all have the chance to play the game.” “Yes, Mika told me of this.” Maslyukov said with a shake of his head. “That is why I would ask you two to stay. You will never rise to a position like mine, or even that of Mika, but I would listen to your ideas as we struggle to keep the Union alive. Can you stomach that, even though you were born American?” “What if the Union does not survive?” Davey asked with a raised eyebrow. “What then?” “Then, you will help build a new Rodina.” Maslyukov said with a shrug. Before coming to Moscow, I’d have never expected to hear a Russian say something like this. Davey and I hadn’t spoken about the future, but he obviously had been thinking about it, and reached some decisions. I knew him, and could reason out what his thinking might be without having to talk it out. He knew I was always worried about the days after the fall of the Soviet Union. As Sean had said, my plans for trying to help from the outside had failed. Maybe working from the inside would see a different result. The long range plans would be affected of course, but they had been centered on more than just the United States. They were not about setting up a third political party in the United States, or getting any one individual elected. No, the plans were about changing how people looked at the world, and about the role of government and the individual. It was about taking responsibility for ourselves as individuals, and as a society. “I am willing to stay.” I said after we had all remained silent for a long time. Davey nodded, and Maslyukov nodded. “Then I will see the two of you in my office next Monday.” Maslyukov as he stood up and prepared to leave. “We have much work to do.” He wasn’t lying, either. There was a lot of work to do. Over the next few weeks, and months, we butted head with several different factors. First of course, was that this was still the Soviet Union, and its bureaucracy was filled with loyal communists. Gorbachev said he wanted private ownership, but those who had to implement such things considered private ownership anathema. Then there was corruption. Corruption had always been a part of the bureaucracy. To one extent or another, it was always a factor no matter the form of government. That was why, in the United States, anti-corruption laws were so important. One of the reasons America’s form of government worked was because corruption was limited, kept under relative control. The fact that every year there was at least one corrupt lawmaker getting caught was a testament to how well the system worked, not necessarily to its failure. Failure was when corruption happened and was never caught. In the more authoritarian USSR, corruption was far more rampant. Those in authority had more power, and in many cases investigators were either hamstrung in their ability to root it out, or had no interest. Blatant corruption of course was dealt with, and every so often the government would trot out an excessively corrupt bureaucrat as an example, but few of those in power feared being hauled off to prison. The changing rules on property and business ownership meant that more and more people were seeing opportunities to make a quick ruble, and many of them lacked any sense of ethics. We were still outsiders for the most part, and while they called us ‘Sergei’ and ‘Yuri’, and we all spoke mostly Russian, those we worked with and for rarely forgot that we were not really Russian. It was a barrier for us, but not an insurmountable one. Davey’s relationship with his family back in the States continued unchanged. They didn’t speak to him, and he didn’t speak to them. My parents told me that Mr. Jones had patched up his relationship with them, and gone back to work at the company that Dad still ran. When I visited them towards the end of Spring, they questioned me intently on why I was staying in the USSR. At Mr. Rush’s house, Mr. Long was waiting expectantly for me. I had another long series of reports for him, and he was most interested in hearing about Maslyukov’s statement regarding the USSR crumbling. He explained how he was filtering our reports through several different channels, making it almost impossible to track down where they came from, which was a good thing because I knew of at least one spy that was operating within the CIA at this time. I could have warned him about that person, but I had not come up with a way to explain how I knew about that person, while not creating the expectation that I would know of other things. Davey and I continued a comfortable existence in Moscow by and large. Occasionally, some woman from work would express an interest in one of us, but would look somewhere else when we showed no interest. At night, we would occasionally go out with groups of co-workers, or Russian friends from University. Both of us enjoyed the many theaters in Moscow. Not the movie theaters, but the stage plays, ballets, and even the opera, although Davey didn’t like operas nearly as much as I did. Back in March of 1990, Gorbachev had sent tanks into Lithuania to prop up the communist government. Later in that same year, Latvia and Estonia began the process of declaring their independence, and the tanks did not roll in to stop them. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, we watched along with the rest of the world as the United States rallied together an impressive coalition to throw Iraq out of that small country. When the battle began in early 1991, our friends in Moscow reacted with shock at the total collapse of Saddam’s largely Soviet-supplied and trained military. While the world was occupied watching what was happening in the Middle East, the KGB and Soviet Army troops again took to the streets in Lithuania. Their nationalist media was going further than the other states in pushing for independence. Maslyukov remained tight-lipped about the meetings of the Central Committee, but we could tell they were growing more and more intense and fractured. There were days that Davey and I held our breaths, or had to bite our tongues to keep from revealing too much knowledge of what was right around the corner. While US troops mopped up operations in Iraq and Kuwait, the Soviet Union voted. Davey was technically a citizen, and actually got to take part in the vote. It was in March of 1991 that nearly eighty percent of Soviet citizens voted to keep the Soviet Union, albeit in a reformed manner. Most of the ‘breakaway’ states didn’t want to lose access to the larger Russian markets that full independence would bring. What they wanted was less central-control from Moscow, and more local control. Maslyukov breathed a sigh of relief that his Soviet Union had passed a major crisis and survived. I didn’t tell him what was right around the corner. Boris Yeltsin was running for the office of President of the Russian SFSR against Nikolai Ryzhkov. Mikhail Gorbachev was supporting Ryzhkov, but we both knew it was Yeltsin that would win, and in a few months stand up to the tanks of the Soviet Union. Davey and I, still using our system of tapping out messages just in case there was someone listening, discussed whether we should get involved in the campaign or not. In the end we went to Maslyukov with the matter. “Why do you want to support Yeltsin?” Maslyukov asked. Just a few years ago, elections like these, where you had several different candidates, and only one of them a member of the Communist Party would not have been possible. “I believe he will win.” Davey answered. “Yes, but why do you want to support him?” Maslyukov pushed and Davey looked at him with a confused expression for a moment. “This is not America, Sergei. Supporting the wrong candidate here is much more dangerous, especially for one who works for the Soviet Union. No, don’t get that look on your face my young friend. This is no longer the old Soviet Union. Lefortovo will not be graced with your presence just for supporting Yeltsin. Still, I might be told that your work is no longer needed here, and I will find it hard to disagree.” “We will miss working for you, comrade.” Davey said quietly, but firmly. “There are other jobs in Moscow, though.” “Especially if you helped with the right campaign.” Maslyukov nodded and then he sighed. “We will have to keep in contact.” “Of course.” Davey said with a smile. With that we left the office, and returned to work for the afternoon. That night we went home to the large townhouse that we had purchased, partly with money from Davey’s inheritance, and partly through selling some of the stocks we had received via our parents. It was one of those old eighteenth-century homes, with huge rooms, carved borders, and tall, narrow doors. Lina had dinner ready, as usual, when we got home. She had accepted our offer to live with us after Mika had died. She was now retired, receiving her pension from the state, but stayed with us for free, as well as received a small stipend to supplement her income. In return, she cooked dinner for us, and did most of the basic cleaning. Here she was close enough to her adult children that she could visit them, and her grandchildren nearly every day. It was a good arrangement that worked for all of us. The timeline was moving along so smoothly, heading straight in the direction that we expected, and even I had to admit that being where we were, at the center of change in Russia and the collapse of the Soviet Union was a breathtaking experience. Moscow was flooded with more foreigners than ever before, many of them ‘consultants’ brought in to help with the reforms of Gorbachev. It was amusing watching them struggle with the Soviet bureaucrats, so stuck in their ways, and yet knowing that change was on the horizon. Davey and I were both welcomed into the Yeltsin camp with open arms and many shots of vodka. Both of us were quite surprised that on our first day we got to sit down with Boris Yeltsin himself for nearly thirty minutes, talking about his vision of the future. Neither of us was surprised by his continued dedication to communism. The collapse of communism was by and large an accident of fate more than anything else. In order to understand how it happened, it is necessary to understand how the ordinary Russian perceived leadership. Maybe it was because of the repeated Mongol invasions, followed by Hitler’s greatest mistake of World War II where he invaded and devastated Russia before being thrown back, but the average Russian prefers strong leadership. Ideas and concepts such as communism or democracy, or feeding the poor, or even justice often take a second seat in who a Russian will support compared to the ‘strength’ of the candidate. Will the candidate be strong? Will they be able to lead Russia (or the Soviet Union) against all enemies? This theory of Russian electioneering was originally something I’d learned from the first Davey I had met. However, it had been proven over several lifetimes. The Soviet Union collapsed, according to this theory, not because of a failure of communism so much as a failure of leadership. Gorbachev took a fatal blow in public opinion when his own deputies managed to seize control from him. His deputies who took over failed to garner enough support from the public, and from the military. Yeltsin was able to seize the initiative, and because both Gorbachev and the coup plotters were pro-communist, the only alternative was to do away with the crumbling system. The only winners in that showdown were Yeltsin and his supporters, and Yeltsin won because he was seen showing strength and being victorious. Years later, when Putin took the reins of power from an ailing Yeltsin, it was his strength that allowed him to stay in power long after he should have left the position. His strength gave his viewpoints an air of legitimacy, and so he stayed in power. No one could muster the appearance of strength for many years in order to challenge him. Working on the election was an invigorating experience for both of us. It was different from American elections, but at the same time there were some core fundamentals that were unchanged. Controlling the message of the campaign was just as important, if not more important in these elections, and that was where I found my niche in working with Yeltsin’s senior advisors. Davey’s gift for writing found him working with the speechwriters for Yeltsin’s addresses, and after his victory (which was unsurprising for us), we found ourselves in middle-level positions of the administration of the Russian state government. It wasn’t too difficult for us to obtain visas for our friends to come out and visit us the week before the coup we expected to happen. Trevor was the most difficult to arrange, mostly because his parents were defectors, but even he was able to obtain a visa in this age of perestroika. They arrived on a British Airways flight in Moscow’s main airport, and Davey and I were there to meet them. The changes in our friends over the past several years were shocking to us in many ways. We had kept in touch by letters, and the occasional phone call, but seeing them after all these years was different. Trevor’s brown hair was cut short, and he was in great physical shape. Todd’s hair was longer, and paler red than it had been years ago. Brandon’s hair was longer, nearly touching his shoulders, and he was slimmer than I had expected. Sean’s hair was darker, and his freckles had started to fade, but he was actually more built up than Brandon. “Look at you two.” Trevor said with a smile after we had all hugged in the middle of the airport’s concourse after they had passed through customs without too much trouble. “What?” Davey asked in English. “You look… Russian.” Trevor said, also in English. He alone of our friends had any fluency in Russian. “We have been here for a few years.” I replied with a slight smile, and found it odd to be speaking English after using Russian almost exclusively all these years. Actually, I’d used English on my visits home, but speaking it here, in Moscow, felt truly odd. “Let’s get out of here.” “You’re going to love our house.” Davey promised them as we made our way out and found two taxis that would take us to the house. Davey rode in a car with Trevor and Todd while I went with Brandon and Sean in the other taxi. “Wow, it’s nicer than I thought.” Sean said as we drove down the road. “Moscow is very beautiful, especially in the summer.” I replied to his statement and heard a grunt from the driver. He was trying to take us the longer way to our destination and I spoke to him briefly in Russian. The driver frowned, but nodded and turned back to the shorter path. “Are we really going to the ballet tomorrow night?” Brandon asked with a slight grin on his face. “Yes.” I assured him. “That will be fun.” Sean agreed. The chatter continued like that, with no references to the real reason for their visit. I played the good tour guide, pointing out important historical sights along the way to the house, and when we reached it, I paid the driver off with a very slight tip since he’d tried to cheat us. “Can we talk freely here?” Trevor asked in English once we’d gotten inside the house and were all sitting in the living room. Lina was visiting her grandchildren today, and so we had the house to ourselves. “Yes.” Davey assured them. “Why’d you want us here?” Brandon asked with a frown. “Not that it’s not good to see you guys again. I mean, we haven’t gotten together at all in years, so why now?” “You know the coup is about to happen.” Davey said with a frown. “We thought you’d want to see it in person.” “Well, kind of.” Trevor shrugged. “But, what does this all have to do with our long-range plans? Why are you two here instead of in the U.S.?” “I think I overlooked something important in those plans.” I said with a sigh and looked up to see their expressions of surprise. “What would that be?” Sean asked with a little half-smile. “I’ve made the typical mistake of American hubris.” I said with a shrug. “In the planning, I looked at things too much from a solely American perspective, always at changing things from the outside, not the inside of other nations. Look, this has always been about changing the perspective of people so that they look at the world from a larger perspective. How do we think we can make that change from solely within the United States?” “So you’re going to try to make changes here in the Soviet Union?” Trevor asked in a tone of disbelief. “No, from the Russian Federation.” Davey countered. “The Soviet Union must end, that is obvious. History records its fate over and over again. It is an unsustainable system. What we’re going to do is try to cut down on the initial corruption and growth of the crime syndicates after the Soviet collapse. We’re in position now to do that, all we have to do is wait for the change in power to happen by the end of this year.” “What we’re going to need though is your help.” I added. “Here we have influence, and frankly we are well off enough that we can lead comfortable lives, but we won’t have the capital to really make some of the differences we need to make.” “How are things going on your end?” Davey asked them. “We’re good.” Trevor said with a smile at Todd, and the two of them clasped hands briefly. It was sweet to see their fondness for each other had not changed. “I’ve been picked up by the Rams, and I’ve already had the conversation with the coach. If the story breaks about us as a couple, they aren’t going to drop me. We don’t plan on breaking the story anytime soon, but it’s a good contract.” “I’ve got good news for you as well.” Todd said with a grin. “You might actually get to see some original movies for once without having to wait for the 21st Century. I’ve signed a good deal for a script I found, and if it works out, well, we’ll be well on the way to having a comfortable financial base between what I make and what Trevor makes.” “We’re doing damn good too.” Sean said firmly with a wink at Brandon. “None of us are going to have to turn to the lottery trick this time around, that’s for sure.” “So you’re wanting to take our hard-earned money, are you?” Brandon asked with mock severity. “We’re wanting you to invest it wisely.” Davey countered with a smile for Brandon. “It’s a perfect opportunity to get in on the ground floor.” “There’s more to the world than just Russia and the United States.” Trevor replied with a frown. “Yes, but maintaining the balance of two superpowers is important.” I countered. “Let’s face it, nature abhors a vacuum, and the unbridled supremacy of the United States during the 1990’s and early 21st Century is part of what got our homeland into so much trouble in those later years, during my original timeline. A stronger Russia on the international stage in the mid to late-1990’s and early 21st Century can make a huge difference, like it did in the 2020’s and 2030’s before the vacuum after Putin’s assassination.” “Do you really think you can accelerate Russian growth and domination so quickly?” Trevor asked with a frown. “It’s not a matter of accelerating its growth so much as it is stopping its decline.” Davey countered with a grin. “The 1990’s, under Yeltsin, was a time of massive decline, especially in the first five years. Yeltsin couldn’t be bothered to handle the little details, and those were what killed the Russian Federation. He cared only about the ‘big picture’, not all the little things that let the crime syndicates gain too much power, and slowed the economic growth of the country. Along with the associated corruption that was allowed to happen, well it was a mess in those early years.” “That is where Sergei and I will make the difference.” I added. “Sergei?” Brandon asked. “Who is Sergei?” “That’s my Russian name.” Davey shrugged and I blushed. Normally I didn’t slip up like that, but for some reason it was happening more and more lately. “Sorry.” I said with a blush. “Being here, now, gives you a reason for helping to invest in Russia’s economy in the near future.” Davey added. “Now will be the time that a little bit of money can make a huge difference, and Trevor, your public sports position will be helpful too, especially if your parent’s story comes out in public after the collapse.” “They won’t like that.” Trevor frowned. “No, but it will help.” Davey countered. “Part of the initial problem is that every bit of help the United States offers at this point in time comes with a price tag that the Russian government cannot pay. Instead of treating Russia like a potential partner, they try to treat this country like a defeated enemy, and that’s something on your end that needs to change.” “I’m just a sports figure.” Trevor countered. “Hell, right now I’m not even on the ‘A’ list of things.” “No, but you’re in the best position to get the press to look at you and to listen.” I countered and Trevor frowned. “You’re asking a lot, you know.” He said with resignation. “We know.” Davey assured him. “What about Shevardnadze?” Sean asked. “Any sign he did come back in time?” “None.” I answered quickly. “It appears the jamming of the frequency he and the scientist used did work, without affecting the frequency you used, or the one that we all used the last time.” “That’s good.” Sean said with a sigh. “He’d have been back for a few years by now.” “Yes.” Davey agreed. “Look, I know this isn’t easy for any of us, but remember, this is why we did come back. We need to make the world a better place, and the only way to do that is to make sure it stays balanced.” “I agree.” Todd said with a frown. “Part of me doesn’t like it, because it feels like we’re being disloyal to the United States, but you’re right. In the long run the best thing is for the United States to have competition in the international stage.” “The same goes for any country.” Davey said. “No matter what we do, the United States must remain strong and independent.” “We agree on that.” Sean said with a nod of his head. “Now that we’ve got that out of the way, how about showing us some of Moscow?” Trevor asked. “Have you two taken up smoking?” “No!” Davey nearly shouted. “But I bet you drink vodka.” Todd laughed. “Konyechna!” I said, slipping back into Russian without even thinking about it, and Davey translated for me with a laugh. He got up and brought a bottle of vodka along with several glasses, and we proceeded to teach our friends some of the best Russian toasts we had learned over the years. It was funny watching Todd and Sean stagger around, barely able to walk as we went to dinner at a nearby restaurant later than night. They were all tired from the flight, and the plan was for them to go to bed after they’d eaten. Trevor ordered for himself, but we translated for the others and after dinner everyone was asleep within minutes upon our return to the house. “I love you.” Davey whispered as he curled up against me and fell asleep. It felt surprising good to be surrounded by our friends, and the nervousness that had been growing in me over the last few weeks faded away. Knowing the coup was coming, and that the end result was going to be good for everyone was one thing, but I kept worrying that something could still happen to Davey and I, caught in the middle of the coup. Having our friends here made it seem a much more remote possibility. Chapter 27 They were angry, and yet at the same time they were happy. The crowds that surged around us were a veritable flux of emotions ranging from extreme anger to almost giddiness about the things going on around them. Certainly it was far more emotion than we had ever seen before from the normally stoic Muscovites. So far, everything was going pretty much as we had expected. Senior members of the Soviet leadership had arrested Mikhail Gorbachev and declared an emergency across the nation. Boris Yeltsin was leading popular protests here in Moscow that started out somewhat muted, but when the army failed to open fire, erupted into full-scale public outrage the likes of which Russia had not seen since 1917. Of course there were differences. Those differences included our presence among the senior staff advising Boris Yeltsin. Say what you will about the man, and historians have always had plenty to say about him, but Boris Yeltsin understood opportunity, politics, and the feelings of the average Russian citizen. He knew that no matter what happened, from this point on his political nemesis Mikhail Gorbachev was ruined as a leader. The Russian people didn't follow weak leaders. They admired strength, dedication, and would often overlook political ideology if the leaders were strong enough. Because of the coup, Mikhail Gorbachev would never be viewed as a strong leader. Boris Yeltsin, by standing up to the coup plotters, was granted an aura of strength that resonated with the general public, and they were listening to his calls for meaningful reforms. Davey, our friends, and I made only a few contributions to the events of those days. In the five minutes the two of us had alone with him in the first day of the coup, he listened to our passionate speech about dealing with corruption. We spent three of those five minutes doing our best to convince him corruption was a big enough problem that it must be dealt with quickly once the coup was ended. \"Do you have plans on how to do this?\" He asked us with a shrewd look when we were done. \"Da.\" Davey said firmly. We were seated in Yeltsin's office and had brought briefcases with us. My lover took a large folder out of his briefcase and put it on the Russian President's desk. Yeltsin frowned before picking up the file that was five inches thick, and leafed through the first set of handwritten pages barely skimming over the text. \"You have detailed plans.\" He said simply as he shut the file and handed it back to Davey who took it quickly. It was a good thing Yeltsin had not looked past the first fifteen handwritten pages, because most of the rest was just filler, used to make it look thicker. We had counted on his disinterest in details and the thickness was really meant to just impress him. \"Give me a one-page paper with talking points.\" \"Will these do?\" Davey asked, pulling another piece of paper out of his briefcase and handing it to the President. Yeltsin looked over the handwritten paper quickly and then nodded. \"You come prepared.\" He stated gruffly. \"We believe this is a very important issue.\" I said firmly and he nodded again. \"Many of my closest advisors will not be happy with this.\" He stated. \"In the interest of moving forward into a new era, it might be good to offer a general amnesty for past wrongs.\" Davey suggested with a shrug. \"Include Black Marketers and others in the amnesty.\" I added. \"We can use their skills. They are able to move goods past the borders, under the noses of security while we cannot move goods from farms or factories to the markets on the legal roads.\" \"You two will organize this.\" He said firmly, giving us everything we had hoped for, and more. \"I will see you outside.\" \"Thank you, Mr. President.\" Davey said as we stood and left the room. The other contribution that we made came on the day Boris Yeltsin stood on the tank in Red Square. There were tears in my eyes, and the eyes of our friends who stood with us, near Yeltsin himself as he climbed on the tank. Here was history being made, and we hoped that with only slight changes it would truly make the world a better place. In the last timeline, our children had never really understood the concept of the Soviet Union and the threat that it posed to the world. They grew up in a world where the Soviet system of government had been thrown on the trash pile of history. For those of us in the previous generation, and the generation before that, we understood the danger represented by the Soviets. It was about more than just nuclear weapons being pointed at each other, and global games of brinkmanship. For as long as there had been countries and governments, such games were played. The dangers of the Soviet era were about more than just geopolitics. It represented a philosophy, an outlook on life that was antithetical to all the principles most Americans held dear. At its core, communism eliminated the ability to make a better life for yourself through your choices and actions. Yes, you were allowed some choices, but it regulated your choices, and your rewards for excellence. It eliminated the rewards inimical in doing a job to the best of your abilities. Whether you were a doctor, a factory worker, or a farm worker, it left you in the same situation. What motivation was there for a person to excel in their field? Further, it required a strict adherence to the communist philosophy. Those who dissented, or believed otherwise where shunted aside, and not given the opportunities of others who at least mouthed loyalty to the communist party. That was one reason for the inherit corruption that existed in the Soviet government. \"This is absolutely amazing.\" Todd whispered in English as we watched Yeltsin berate the troops for supporting the corrupt coup plotters. Around us the crowd surged again, and I smiled at Davey, wanting to hold his hand, but knowing better than to make such a public display of affection. His smile told me everything I needed to know, although when it turned into a frown, I began to grow worried until I noticed he was looking over my shoulder. \"What is it?\" I asked in English and he shook his head, his eyes scanning the buildings behind me. When he turned, I was surprised by his actions and started to turn and look in the direction he'd been looking, but was distracted by him running towards the tank. Davey leaped into the air, tackling Yeltsin and pulling him to the ground. For a wild moment, I thought he'd gone crazy, but I'd caught the flash of something hitting the tank, and heard the grunt from Brandon. \"Sniper!\" Davey yelled in Russian as he covered Yeltsin's body with his own while the President's security people swarmed the two of them. Sean was trying to hold up the much taller Brandon, and Todd, Trevor and I rushed over to them. Brandon was bleeding from his left shoulder, and I figured out what had happened quickly. Davey had seen the flash of a scoped rifle in the buildings behind us, figured out there was a sniper there, and acted, figuring the target was Boris Yeltsin. The bullet had ricochet off the tank, and hit Brandon. Fortunately, the wound wasn't bad, and appeared to have missed anything vital. Around us, the crowd went wild as they realized someone had just tried to shoot Yeltsin. What had been a relatively peaceful demonstration turned into a full-scale riot, and the soldiers as well as the policemen who had been standing by were suddenly fighting for their lives against the angry civilians. Somewhere another shot rang out, and then another. \"We've got to get out of here.\" I said as we were jostled by the crowd that was swaying in every direction. Trevor nodded, picking Brandon up and putting him into a fireman's carry as the rest of us tried to clear a path. Yeltsin, and Davey, were already being hustled out of the area by security people loyal to Yeltsin, and we were left to fend for ourselves. It took nearly two hours to reach a hospital, and only my government identification got Brandon in to see a doctor. The hospital was overcrowded in the extreme, and Moscow was literally on fire from the rioting. While we waited for word on Brandon, and tried to comfort a very worried Sean, we watched the sky glowing red with distant fires. A ring of militia had cordoned off the hospital, just as they were doing with important locations throughout the city. All the television and radio stations were silent, and I was wondering what had gone wrong when a black car was admitted past the security ring. Several uniformed KGB officers got out, and I knew instinctively they were here for me. Chapter 28 The KGB was an organization not hemmed in by stupid considerations like the Geneva Convention, the International Agreement on Human Rights or any of the other numerous considerations in how to treat a prisoner. When Brian arrived at Lubyanka prison they made it clear to him that he would tell them what they wanted to know, and they started the process with their fists. Part of him hoped that Davey would somehow come for him, but on the second day they gave him copies of Pravda, the main newspaper. Later that day they threw in copies of the New York Times. Yeltsin was dead, Gorbachev had ceded power to the men who had started the coup, and their hopes for a better future were dead as well. If they thought that news would break him, they were wrong. Nor did he believe the claims that Davey and the others had been captured. He wouldn't believe anything they told him about Davey until they showed Brian his lover's body, alive or dead. The beatings continued for several days, and then they began the next course of treatment. Brian remembered the War on Terror and the secrets that came out of the second Bush that caused him to be a one-term President. Davey's father had spent a great deal of time rebuilding the US reputation after the extent of how America had tortured people became widely known. The man had barely been able to prevent the former President from being tried on War Crimes charges, but eventually the furor died down. These men didn't care about any of those things. Nor were they constrained by the semantics that limited the United States in its interrogation of terrorists. There were worst things than waterboarding, sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation and loud rock music. They worked faster too, and before a week was out, Brian was ready to tell them everything he knew, give them every answer that they wanted. They didn't believe him. As he stuttered out his confession of time travel and the intention of forging a stronger, more independent Russia in the years ahead, his interrogators didn't bother stifling their laughter. Brian would have laughed too, but it wasn't that type of situation. That was when they decided to start on his fingers, tearing his fingernails off with a device that had probably been invented by the Spanish Inquisition. The same men laughed at his screams of pain, and his stuttering insistence in Russian that every word he said was true. He didn't know how long the next phase of torture lasted, but when it ended he was little more than a bleeding wreck of a human being. That was when they started giving him morphine for the pain, and even after his fingers started healing, they kept giving him the wonderful, blissful pain medicine. Brian knew he was becoming addicted, but the desire for the sweet feeling of numbness and total release from the physical confines of his body had him craving for more, begging for more when they suddenly stopped giving him the drug. All sense of time had left him when the pains of withdrawal began to cramp his stomach, and he lost the tasteless gruel they had fed him for breakfast. For days he went through withdrawal, nausea, cramps, and the awful sweats filled his days and nights while he begged for some form of relief. When the worst of the withdrawal symptoms had passed, his wishes were granted and a soldier came in to give him another shot of the drug. \"You will wash yourself today.\" The guard said as he left Brian's small cell. The door opened a little later, and another soldier brought in several basins and washrags that Brian used to clean himself. His body was beginning to recover, and even his fingernails were beginning to grow again as he washed the crusted blood off of them. His hair had been shaved off to guard against lice in this place. The bruises on his face had largely healed, leaving only the palest of splotches on his once-pristine skin. Davey might not have liked what he saw if he could see Brian at that moment, but with the morphine in his system, Brian cared little about his lover's thoughts. All of that hurt, and only the numbing drug coursing through him let him look at himself in the small mirror they had provided. \"He will shave you.\" A guard said after Brian had dressed in the faded black jumpsuit they provided him. They shoved in a kid with a shaved head like Brian's, wearing faded jeans and a dingy shirt. The boy was barely eighteen, if he was even that old, and his hands were only slightly steadier than Brian's would have been on the razor. Still, he managed to shave off Brian's growing beard with only a few nicks, and then the guard was taking him away. They came for Brian a few minutes later, leading him through the narrow concrete hallways up into the ‘proper' area of the complex. The room they left him in was small, with bare concrete walls and a chair on either side of the table. He followed their instructions to sit in one of the chairs and didn't move as they chained him to it as they'd done before. He sat in the room for a long time, long enough for the effects of the morphine to start fading, and he was preparing himself once again for the withdrawals that would come when it left his system. It was obvious this was done on purpose, so that whenever his interrogator came in, he would be more cooperative, hoping they would give him more of the drug. That was what the small corner of his brain that still worked objectively told him while the greater part of him began plotting how he could make them happy so he would stop hurting. \"Greetings, comrade.\" An older man said in Russian as he entered the room. Brian had not seen the older, overweight man with the slightly bald head before. \"Privyet.\" Brian replied, also in Russian. He wasn't sure if he could even speak in anything but the most basic English anymore. \"You are looking better, comrade.\" The man said as he sat down across from Brian and placed a stack of papers on the table. \"Thank you.\" Brian said as politely as he could manage. \"I believe you should be a writer of fiction, comrade, with the story you have spun for your interrogators.\" The man continued. \"I am Colonel Bradikov, and your case of treason has been given to me to handle. Cooperate with me and you will find me a much better person than your previous handlers.\" \"I will cooperate.\" Brian murmured and hated himself for the words as soon as they left his mouth. The shakes were beginning again already, though, and he knew cooperation was the only way to get more. \"Yes, you will.\" Bradikov agreed. \"Even in your stories, there are grains of truth, and together we will work out those grains of truth. There will be no more interrogation sessions. Just you and I here in this room. Work with me, and you will be given better food, allowed to clean yourself, and of course, medicine for your pain.\" \"What do you want from me?\" Brian asked sadly, knowing he would do whatever the man wanted now that he had promised Brian more morphine. Part of him wondered how he'd gotten to this point so quickly, but most of him didn't care. \"Truth.\" Bradikov said simply. \"Your story is a sad one, of course. You were born to Soviet dissidents, raised in the United States and sent here as a spy to undermine the Motherland. Almost you succeeded and manipulated Comrade Yeltsin into betraying the People. Now you have seen the error of your ways and beg for the opportunity to serve the People in some way to make amends. Your confession will earn you your life, and the opportunity to work hard for the good of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… that's not…\" A spark rose in Brian, trying to resist, but it faded as the shakes grew worse. \"It is the truth, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently. \"The Soviet Union is strong, despite your treason. Your confession will help the People see the truth, and know their true enemy, the United States and its greedy capitalists. You are a product of their lies, but acted out of a true desire to better the people. That is commendable, and you will live out your life in the forests of Siberia with many others of your fellow misguided anarchists. Together you might one day earn your way back into the grand society of the Soviet Union.\" \"I… I…\" Brian stammered and then frowned. There had been nothing said about Davey, or the others, and he felt a glimmer of hope. If they were free, they could build another time machine and go back in time again. They could obliterate this timeline and start afresh. He held little doubt they would find the Brian of that timeline and he would help them, so it mattered little what he did now. \"Okay. You are right.\" \"Very good, comrade.\" Bradikov smiled and he got up, crossing over to Brian's side. With a key he took out of a pocket, he unlocked Brian's shackles. As Brian rubbed his wrists, the man took a needle out of his pocket, setting it down in front of Brian with a gentle smile. \"Here, comrade, for your pain.\" \"I…thank you.\" Brian stammered out as he blushed, ashamed for the greed that filled him. He did snatch the needle though, and injected himself so that he could feel the sweet release of the drug coursing through his system. \"You are very welcome, comrade.\" Bradikov said gently as he watched Brian closely. Brian was lost in the sweet numbing sensations of the drug, and didn't mind when the guards came to escort him back to his cell. Every day after that, Bradikov would summon Brian and they would go over his ‘confession' in detail. Certainly it was as filled with fiction as anything, but Brian only protested when they tried to pin everything on Davey. That protest earned him a week in his cell going through the pains of withdrawals, and then they dragged him back to Bradikov who demanded that Brian agree with the confession that would place most of the blame on Davey. When Brian didn't break, he was sent back to his cell for another week. After a month of this, when Brian had made it through the worst of the withdrawals and his head was beginning to clear up enough that he could almost think straight again, Bradikov realized his approach wasn't working. The beatings resumed, and his fingernails that had almost finished re-growing were ripped off again. Then they forcibly injected him with more drugs, stronger drugs this time. Having to guess from the effects on him, they were stepping him up to pure heroin or something similar. \"I always assumed that perverts like you only cared about the physical things.\" Bradikov said after doctors had spent a month nursing Brian back from the brink of death. His body still craved drugs, but his mind was clearer than it had been since he'd been taken to this hell hole. There had been times in the last few weeks that he couldn't remember his own name, but he'd never forgotten Davey's. \"You have no idea what we have been through together.\" Brian murmured in Russian. \"You have chased each other across time and space according to your story.\" Bradikov huffed. \"Your friends have tried to free you, by the way, with the backing of the new American President, but to no avail. It would have been easier on you to have another to blame, but we will proceed with your confession.\" \"Nyet.\" Brian protested. \"It is too late for anything else.\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have recorded your confessions, and you look quite healthy and convincing on the video. It will be better if you stand before the court and repeat your confession, but either way, it will be done. Cooperate, and you will lead the rest of your life in a work camp. Resist and you will face the firing squad for your treason.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" Brian murmured. \"You believe your friend will build another time machine and erase all that has happened?\" Bradikov laughed. \"We have learned the Australians believe their wild story, even if the Americans do not. We know better. Our top physicists assure us that it is impossible. Truly though, if you believe we will all cease to exist when they are done, what does it matter if you cooperate?\" \"I will do it.\" Brian murmured and ignored the smile on Bradikov's face. When the Colonel set a full needle in front of him, Brian turned his face away from the small thing. \"What, you have beaten your addictions?\" Bradikov laughed and Brian frowned. Oh how he wanted that needle, but he knew better than to take it now. He'd never, in all his life used drugs like this, and he knew he never would again. \"Not all of them.\" Brian sighed, yet he did not take the needle that was offered. \"You are a man of many surprises.\" Bradikov laughed. The work camp he went to after his trial was deep in the Siberian forests. Warm during the summer, freezing cold in the winter, he lived in one of five long barracks buildings with others that had been arrested and exiled following the pro-democracy demonstrations. They were well-guarded day and night, although the work of cutting trees and preparing them for shipping left Brian too tired to even contemplate escape. The food was horrible, and the company even worse. Brian found himself facing angry people that blamed him for their being here. When he fought them off one against one, or two against one, five of the toughest brutes in the camp jumped him. Still, he injured three of them badly enough they were in the primitive medical clinic alongside him. By the time his broken ribs healed and he was put back to work with the logging crews, he'd earned grudging respect. Most of the camp drank the home-brewed alcohol every night, passing their lives into oblivion. Brian stayed away from it with the well-earned aversion he now held to all types of drugs, not just heroin or morphine. The idea of being drunk was as abhorrent now as getting wasted on a needle full of heroin which was somehow plentiful in this place. His biggest hope, as the months and then the years went by was that Davey and the others would one day finish their time machine and end the misery of this existence. Even that hope grew dim as the years went by and many of the camp's worst drunks began dying in the harsh winters. He'd long ago taken young Misha, the thirteen-year old boy that was the youngest inmate in the camp under his wing and to his bed. Not for sex, but rather to stay warm during the freezing nights that claimed so many lives. Without his protection, Misha would have long since died although he did drink himself into a stupor nearly every night. He wasn't even a legal adult, and knew he'd die in this place. The few times he'd reached out to Brian for sexual release, he'd been gently rebuffed, but never strayed from Brian's bed. When Misha began to cough at night, Brian grew worried. Part of his mind warned that he should not let Misha sleep in his bed if he was sick, but Brian cared for the boy, the one bright spot in this miserable existence. Misha was a symbol to him, a symbol that even here in this hell hole he could make the world a slightly better place for even one person. Three weeks later, Misha was in the hospital wing as pneumonia claimed his life, and Brian was soon in a bed there as well as pneumonia took root in his own lungs. Modern antibiotics could have healed both of them, but the camp's doctor would not waste them on prisoners. Only guards got that sort of treatment. Even the food rations of sick prisoners were cut so that the food would go to other, stronger workers. Brian knew he was going to die, and welcomed the delirium as his fever began to grow. They were sweet dreams in the delirium, dreams of Davey and a few other men raiding the camp, freeing him and somehow sneaking him out of the camp. Dreams of a time machine, and whispered assurances that everything was going to be okay. He had the dream several times, and when the last one happened, he knew it was going to be the last dream ever. His body was weak and he no longer even tried to cough up the fluid that was filling his lungs. As he drifted off to sleep, he hoped that he would drown from the fluid in his lungs and die dreaming of his Davey. \"Brian.\" Oh great, instead of dreams about Davey, he was now having dreams about his mother. At least they would distract him from the realities of the cold Siberian winter, and he could feel the warmness of his childhood bed. Hearing his name in English sounded odd, after all these years though, and he wondered why he was dreaming in English. He hadn't dreamed in that language in a long, long time. \"Wake up, Brian!\" \"Nyet.\" Brian murmured as another male voice was added to the dream voice of his mother's. He told them in Russian that he loved his dreams more than reality. \"What language is that?\" His mother's voice asked as he dreamed of feeling her cool hand on his forehead. \"He has a fever. Feel his forehead. Oh dear, he's sick on the first day of school.\" Thinking of the first day of school made him think of Davey. Ah, this was better after all. His last dream before he died would be about the first day of middle school, where he and Davey always seemed to meet for the ‘first time' in a timeline. That would be a wonderful thing to dream about, to dream about the future of their lives together in a new timeline, even if it never came to reality. \"Now who could that be?\" Brian's father's voice sounded worried and Brian thought he could hear the chimes of the doorbell. \"Oh, hello.\" Brian's mother's voice was filled with surprise and worry. \"Brandon, Trevor, we didn't expect to see you here. Brian's not feeling to well.\" \"That's what we figured.\" Came the familiar voice of Trevor. \"Mrs. Breckenridge, these are some of our friends, Sean Rule, Todd Williams and Davey Jones. They came with us to get Brian and take him to school.\" \"I'm afraid he's too sick to go to school.\" Brian's mother said. \"Beloved, open your eyes.\" Davey said in Russian, and his voice sounded much younger. This was a good dream, Brian decided and opened his eyes to see a twelve-year old Davey Jones smiling at him. \"Young again, you look so young again.\" Brian said and was surprised that his chest didn't hurt. Naturally he spoke in Russian. \"What language is that?\" Brian's mother asked in a slightly high voice. \"It's Russian.\" Trevor answered. \"Brian doesn't speak Russian.\" She snapped. \"He does now.\" Trevor answered. \"Look, there are some things we should probably share with you. Why don't we go into the living room and we'll try to explain while Davey helps Brian.\" \"What's wrong with him?\" Brian heard his mother ask. \"He's had a rough couple of years.\" Brandon answered sadly, but Davey was taking all of Brian's attention. \"This is a nice dream.\" Brian said as he lifted his hand and ran a finger along Davey's cheek. His lover was always a little overweight at this age, but he still looked wonderful. \"It isn't a dream.\" Davey whispered in Russian. \"Yes it is.\" Brian said. \"It's my last dream. The pneumonia is going to kill me, I know it and I'm okay with it. You'll finish the time machine and make this awful timeline go away. Just don't mess up the next one, okay? I'd hate for that version of me to go through this hell. Still, I didn't betray you. Never you.\" \"I know love, I know.\" Davey whispered softly as he bent down and planted a kiss on Brian's nose. \"We did build the machine, and before we used it, we got you out of that damn place. It was close, and you were right, the pneumonia was killing you. Still, we were able to bribe the right people and found out where you were being held. The mercenaries we hired were good, and we got you out with the KGB hot on our trail.\" \"They didn't believe me about the time machine.\" Brian murmured. \"They figured it out in the end, and they believed alright.\" Davey laughed. \"They tried assaulting the facility, but we held them off, with the help of the Australians. Who would have believed it, the Australians helping us when our own country turned their backs on us?\" \"What did you have to give them?\" Brian asked, playing along with the wonderful dream. \"Our solemn promise to not try changing the course of history again.\" Davey laughed. \"I expected them to demand one of their own go back, but they laughed and said they knew better than to mess with history. The only reason they helped us at all was because the Soviet Union was starting to duke it out with Europe and the United States. Their economy was still shit, and they had to stir up trouble in order to keep things under control.\" \"Sounds awful.\" Brian murmured, just letting himself get lost in those wonderful blue eyes that he'd dreamed about, and was still dreaming about. \"Your temperature is dropping.\" Davey said softly. \"Sean was worried that your fever in the other timeline would be replicated here because you believed you were sick. At the end you were delirious, and even though your body is healthy in the here and now, the mind has an awful lot of control over how the body works, and I know you've been through hell.\" \"We've all been through hell.\" Brian murmured, letting himself feel Davey's hand on his chest, and relishing the smile. This was definitely the best of his delirious dreams. \"This is the last time, I promise.\" Davey whispered. \"We set it so we got back here a week before you, and we had time to prepare for today.\" \"What do you mean?\" Brian asked with a frown and something deep inside began whispering to him that this was real, not another dream. It certainly felt more real than any other dream he'd had. \"We made a promise to the Australians, and we're going to keep that promise.\" Davey said with a firm expression. \"No more mucking with the timeline, for the most part. No more trying to save people from AIDS, or stopping Osama bin Laden, or getting rid of the second Bush Presidency. If people are stupid enough to vote for the man, then they're going to have to live with the consequences.\" \"But…\" Brian's voice trailed off and he realized that Davey had said the last in English. The language was coming back to him, slowly but surely. \"No buts, love.\" Davey said in a soft whisper. \"Some things will change. The others are telling your mother and father right now. They need to know because we'll need their help making sure my father doesn't do… some of the stupid things he's done before. Papa knows too. He's a smart man and he's proven in the past he can help us, and he is, you know.\" \"Let me guess, he won some money on a bet.\" Brian laughed softly, and English felt a little odd on his tongue, but good as well. This was how it should be. \"It worked, and it's enough to get things started.\" Davey said. \"No one will be rich, but we will be able to get our families off the ground in their own businesses. There will be fights when they figure it out about us, but we can win those fights as well. No going to the President though, no warning him about the future, or the next President, or the one after that. We let those events play out as they will.\" \"Is that not a little selfish of us?\" Brian asked as he sat up and leaned against his headboard to look at Davey. \"I think we've earned the selfishness.\" Davey sighed. \"What about making the world a better place?\" Brian asked determinedly. \"I didn't go through all that to just give up.\" \"What would you have us do?\" Davey asked with exasperation. \"I don't want to lose you again.\" \"Maybe, maybe there's another way.\" Brian asked with a shrug. \"I don't know, but if we really are here, well there has to be a way. We've always tried changing things from the top. Maybe we can change them from the bottom.\" \"It's worth trying.\" Davey said gently and he leaned forward until their lips met. Brian's mind was still hazy, and he knew there would be a lot of issues for him to overcome. His treatment at the hands of the Soviets had been bad, and would require a lot of time to undo all the problems he had experienced. As their kiss deepened, and he felt his love and passion for Davey grow again, he knew that it was something they would be able to do together. Together they could conquer the world. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The End.",
