And created by visual mad scientists John Jennings and Damian Duffy to boot? Fantastic. To see Butler’s work presented in this way is deliciously harrowing. The very medium of the graphic novel already electrifies words and images. Tell one of Octavia’s most immersive, relatable tales through this medium and you have fire. This is an exciting moment in storytelling. Octavia Butler, Level 2. I first came across Octavia’s work around 2001, when I was well on my way to identifying as a black female writer of speculative fiction. I was attending the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers’ Workshop at Michigan State University, and the organizers had brought my group to the local bookstore. As I strolled through the aisles, something extraordinary caught my eye, something I’d only ever seen once before in the science fiction and fantasy section of a bookstore: a cover featuring a dark-skinned black woman. I was staring at Wild Seed by Octavia Estelle Butler. There was only one copy of the book there on that fateful day. I grabbed it, clasped it to my chest as if someone was going to snatch it from me, quickly bought it, and ran to my dorm room to start reading. That was the beginning of my bingeing on Octavia Butler’s works. In the previous weeks at Clarion, I had just begun writing about an angry Nigerian woman in pre-colonial Nigeria who’d been run out of her village because she’d developed the ability to fly. I was one of only two people of color in the writing group, and I was uncomfortable about workshopping my story. Plus, I’d never read a purely speculative story set anywhere on the continent of Africa that addressed womanhood and patriarchy bluntly. When I look back, it’s clear to me that I discovered Octavia right when I needed her. Reading Wild Seed, a story that featured an ageless shape-shifting Nigerian woman, blew my mind.

      "content": "Seed proved that what I was writing was okay, that people like me could be a part of this canon. This was a very big deal to me. Sometime during those few weeks at the Clarion workshop, I learned that Octavia had once taught there, which meant that the organizers could reach her. I immediately asked if they could track her down. Within a day, I was on the phone with the great Octavia Butler, babbling my way through a conversation I don’t remember; I was so starstruck. What I do remember was that Octavia was incredibly kind and liked to crack jokes. That wasn’t the last time we spoke to each other. When the 9/11 attacks happened, I found myself having a surreal email exchange with her. I kept those emails. What she said about terrorists still applies (and was an important theme in Kindred ): One of my favorite quotes—so sadly true—is from Steve Biko: “The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.” There is also the sad reality that it takes very little to set off young men who want to feel powerful and important, but who are either unwilling or unable to find constructive outlets for their energies. Testosterone poisoning. And men have the nerve to complain about women’s hormonal mood swings. In 2005, I had a long conversation with Octavia when I interviewed her about her vampire novel Fledgling ; later that year, I met her in person (for the first and only time) when she came to Chicago State University. Octavia’s email address was butler8star@qwest.net. For a long time after her shocking, sudden passing on February 24, 2006, I continued to send emails to that address, consoling myself by talking to her. Then one sad day, the emails started bouncing back. Thankfully, she left us with so many questions to ponder. Like, what would you do if you were suddenly pulled into the past and had to find a way to survive? v",

      "content": "ABOUT OCTAVIA E. BUTLER She described herself as, “I’m black, I’m solitary, I’ve always been an outsider”—but she left off “extraordinary.” Octavia Estelle Butler was indeed a most extraordinary writer. Often referred to as the “grande dame of science fiction,” she is the author of a short story collection and more than a dozen novels, which have been translated into ten languages. Her work garnered two Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and the PEN Lifetime Achievement Award. She was the first science fiction writer to win a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship. Butler was born in Pasadena, California, on June 22, 1947. A graduate of Pasadena Community College, she also attended California State University and UCLA. When she participated in the Clarion Science Fiction Writing Workshop, she attracted the attention of the famous science fiction writer and editor Harlan Ellison, who gave her a typewriter and bought Butler’s first professional story. Butler began writing as a child and was an avid reader of science fiction— which she couldn’t help but notice never included characters like herself. Many of her novels, such as Kindred , feature strong, black, female protagonists struggling with complicated issues of survival. She was a master of powerful, realistic prose that supported inventive genre narratives, and most important explored the deepest, often disturbing possibilities of human relationships. A list of Octavia Butler’s books can be found on page 240. 238",

BUTLER She described herself as, “I’m black, I’m solitary, I’ve always been an outsider”—but she left off “extraordinary.” Octavia Estelle Butler was indeed a most extraordinary writer. Often referred to as the “grande dame of science fiction,” she is the author of a short story collection and more than a dozen novels, which have been translated into ten languages. Her work garnered two Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and the PEN Lifetime Achievement Award. She was the first science fiction writer to win a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship. Butler was born in Pasadena, California, on June 22, 1947. A graduate of Pasadena Community College, she also attended California State University and UCLA. When she participated in the Clarion Science Fiction Writing Workshop, she attracted the attention of the famous science fiction writer and editor Harlan Ellison, who gave her a typewriter and bought Butler’s first professional story. Butler began writing as a child and was an avid reader of science fiction— which she couldn’t help but notice never included characters like herself. Many of her novels, such as Kindred , feature strong, black, female protagonists struggling with complicated issues of survival. She was a master of powerful, realistic prose that supported inventive genre narratives, and most important explored the deepest, often disturbing possibilities of human relationships.
