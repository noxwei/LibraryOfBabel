This was the first book written in the Library of Doom series. The books are not numbered. They can be read in any order. But this was the first, the beginning of a long and exciting journey. The great Library itself was inspired by a number of libraries, museums, and creepy bookstores that I’ve visited over the years: the Library of Congress, Sir John Soane’s Museum (this place is crazy!), and the main New York Public Library (the one with the lions). I also used to browse a bookstore in Minneapolis, now closed, called Biermaier’s Books. It had creaky old floors and shelves up to the ceiling. I once snuck down to the basement and found more books hidden there than were in the store!",

      "content": "A PAGE FROM THE LIBRARY OF DOOM LIBRARIES The Library of Congress in Washington, DC, United States, contains more than twenty-five million books. It also has four million maps and twelve million photographs on file. The world’s most overdue library book was borrowed from a British university in 1668. The book was returned in 1956 but no fine was charged! The Library of Alexandria in Egypt was considered the greatest library of ancient times. It held more than seven hundred thousand rolls of paper, which is how books were written then. In 1731, Benjamin Frankin opened the world’s first “members only” library. Thanks to Ben, people still use library cards.",

This was the first book written in the Library of Doom series. The books are not numbered. They can be read in any order. But this was the first, the beginning of a long and exciting journey. The great Library itself was inspired by a number of libraries, museums, and creepy bookstores that I’ve visited over the years: the Library of Congress, Sir John Soane’s Museum (this place is crazy!), and the main New York Public Library (the one with the lions). I also used to browse a bookstore in Minneapolis, now closed, called Biermaier’s Books. It had creaky old floors and shelves up to the ceiling. I once snuck down to the basement and found more books hidden there than were in the store!",
