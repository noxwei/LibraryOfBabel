      "title": "– I. The Meeting –",
      "content": "– I. The Meeting – Year 2017 Nicolas was preparing himself for another day at the university. He took his blue backpack with black stripes, full of books, a computer and his Smartphone, in which he could always check his e-mails and text messages sent by friends from college. He drank a glass of milk and took two bites of the sandwich prepared by his mother. He was running late as usual, to get to the bus for his classes. “Nicolas, wait! I need to talk to you.” Lorena shouted, unable to reach him. She looked at the door and saw that he was already inside the bus. She thought it would be better to talk to him at night, since he rarely sat at the table to have breakfast. *** In the bus, Nicolas thought that Monday would be another ordinary day, but many things were about to change in his life. He had white skin, blue eyes, medium and sharp nose, average lips, with the upper being slightly thicker than the lower; he was 5’10”, thin and his hair was dark brown. Romantic, he enjoyed physics and astronomy. His dream was to become a great physician and discover the secrets of the universe. He was studying Physics at the University of California, in Los Angeles, where he lived. The campus was crowded; students and teachers walked everywhere to get to the classrooms. Right at the entrance, Nicolas met his friend Sanchez, a Mexican-born American. His friend always wore his black hair combed to the right side, covering his big forehead. He was 5’11” and spoke the language with perfection, because he lived most of his life in the United States. “Hi, Nick. Today we’re going to meet a new student who got transferred from another university. We’ll also start that discipline we enrolled at in the beginning of the semester, do you remember? And the girl is on the same class. “This course took so much time to begin that I thought it was going to be cancelled. I’m anxious to learn his new subject and to meet the new student.” Nicolas replied. The first three periods of class had passed and the students could barely hide the curiosity about the next class, as well as the freshman, whose beauty had been already commented. At eleven o’clock, they heard the bell announcing the end of the class. Few students left, but many entered the new class. They were excited to learn new things. Finally, the coordinator of the physics department, Doctor Finken, walked into the room and said. “From now on, Cosmology, the science of the Universe, will be taught for those who signed up in the beginning of the period. The course’s coordinator had some problems filling in this position and that is the reason this class did not start yet. Fortunately, we found a very competent professional, who studies the outer space and the great secrets presently known by men. Dr. Carlsson Glein is a PhD in Cosmology.” The coordinator walked toward the door and opened it. “Come in, Doctor Glein.” The professor entered the classroom and looked at the group who were still starring at the door, because a surprisingly beautiful figure was standing in there. It was the new student who everybody was talking about it. When the coordinator, Doctor Finken, noticed the shadow that the new student placed over the Cosmology teacher, he said: “I’ll take the opportunity to introduce our new student, Zara.” And she walked into the room. Nicolas observed her and noticed that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Her hair was red, thick, reaching her shoulders; she had white and smooth skin, blue eyes, full lips and sculptural body, like it was the creation of an artist. She seemed to be around 25 or 30 years old and 5’7”. He soon became mesmerized and tried, with no success, to hide his surprise. Sanchez was sitting beside him and said astonished. “Wow! Nicolas, now the course will become more interesting. What a beauty.” “I’m surprised too. She’s gorgeous!” Zara looked around class and stared at Nicolas like she was trying to read his own thoughts. Then, she walked to the only vacant chair in the room, right by his side. “I’ll leave you alone with your class, Dr. Glein. I hope they like Cosmology.” Said Dr. Finken. “It’s fine. I’m sure they’ll like to study it, because the knowledge about the Universe is amazing.” He introduced himself to the class and began to explain the different subjects he was going to teach. It’s a science that studies the Universe structure, composition and its evolution. “As the noble Dr. Finken said, I graduated in physics, with a PhD in Cosmology. Today I’m going to make a brief introduction about the outer space, but before that I’d like everyone in this class to introduce themselves so we can get more comfortable during our course. We can start by the first one on my left.” The students began to introduce themselves, and it was Nicholas turn. “My name is Nicolas, but you can call me Nick. People here in college call me geek, but I don’t like labels. I dream of being a great physicist and to travel to the space.” Everyone began to laugh, and a student called Adam, who was sitting in the fourth chair on the right corner, said ironically. “You should become an astronaut. I think you’re in the wrong course.” “No more comments.” The professor intervened. “I ask you to be brief or we won’t be able to finish the presentations.” “Nicolas, don’t worry about the space trips.” Zara told him in a low voice, while other student was introducing himself. “Sometimes what we dream can be very close to us.” The boy didn’t understand what she meant but he was still observing everything with curiosity. During the student’s presentations, Zara looked deeply into Nicolas eyes, and he felt something different when he looked at her. A chill inside his chest, and his heart was beating so fast, things that he had never felt before. He wondered where someone with such beauty could come from. “It can’t be. She’s not looking at me. It must be a wrong impression. A woman like her would never get interested in a guy like me.” Nicolas thought. *** Later at home, after his homework he went downstairs to have dinner with his mother and his sister. “My son, today I wanted to give you a good morning kiss, but when I came downstairs you had already left. Why don’t you wake up earlier? So there would be some time for us to talk in the morning. All this rush isn’t good. I feel so lonely since your father has passed.” “That’s okay, mom. I’ll try to wake up a little earlier. We really only have time to talk at night, besides, I also want to give a good morning kiss to Sophia, even if she is not awake.” Sophia smiled happily. She was 8 years old and after her father’s death, she became her mother’s best friend and worshiped her brother. *** During the weekends, Nicolas liked to ride his bike around the city. There was a lot of green everywhere and beautiful landscapes to be admired. Along the way it was possible to find natural springs, that ran through bamboo pipes left by the owners of the sites along the trails. Whenever he got tired, he stopped; leaned the bike on a three and put both hands under the water that poured in abundance and drank it, until his thirsty was quenched. Then, he picked up the bike and kept going hearing the birds singing, which contrasted with the silence of the woods. On Sunday, he was strolling and some heavy drops of water began to fall from the sky. It was almost dark. He felt that nice smell of wet land and increased the speed to get to his home faster. But the rain got stronger and he decided to stop and rest, taking shelter beneath an abandoned hut. That was when, suddenly, a person came into his direction, also trying to escape the rain. As it was coming closer, he could notice it was a woman. Even in the darkness of the night he noticed he knew her. She stopped under the hut and said: “What a storm! Thank God we found this shelter.” “We were lucky, because I guess there isn’t any other in miles.” Nicolas said. “You are the new student, Zara.” “Hi, Nick. Is your name, right? It is nice of you to remember me. You even know my name.” “Yes, I am the student who wants to be an astronaut. Although the other students were laughing, something tells me that in a few decades, space travel will be very common. About your name, I’m sure all the students had already learned it; it’s not usual that a student caused so much admiration on her first day.” Zara blushed with the praise and replied. “Thank you, Nick. Can I call you that? I like your name.” “Yes, you can. It’s nice that you like my name.” “Don’t worry about the comments. There’s always someone to criticize us. Sometimes life changes so much and so fast that we can’t waste time with other people’s opinion.” There was a moment of complete silence; only the singing of the birds and the sound of the raindrops could be heard. They began to look at each other just like in the classroom. The rain was increasing, and he couldn’t hide the attraction he was feeling. She put her bike on the ground and got closer to him. Nicolas touched Zara’s soft skin and her eyes seemed to bewitch him. When the raindrops touched her body, a smell of jasmine made the atmosphere more pleasant. There was nothing else around and the boy let his emotions take over, as happened only a few times in his life. Everything was like a dream and he didn’t want to wake up; he kissed the lips that have messed so much with his heart. They surrendered to that infinite moment and that was the best thing that happened to them. Generally, when he met someone, Nick wasn’t used to feel something so intense, but with Zara everything was different. He had never met a woman with so much experience. He wondered what he could do to make her fall in love with him and stay by his side. It wasn’t enough to only admire her at the college, with a sudden passion; he became closer to her with the intensity of the kiss they shared. She interrupted his line of thoughts, which mingled with his dreams. “Nicolas, it’s getting late. I have to go, because we have classes in the morning. I’ll see you tomorrow.” “That’s okay, Zara. I really liked to see you. I’ll count the hours until tomorrow.” She touched his lips and smiled softly. Since the rain had already stopped, she grabbed her bike and left. The boy arrived home with shining eyes and a huge grin on his face, and Lorena noticed that something different had happened in that Sunday’s ride. “Son, will you tell me what is going on?” “I’ve never seen you so happy!” Sophia exclaimed. “Well... I... met... A person while I was riding my biking. I guess I am... in love.” Mother and daughter smiled understanding that something new happened with Nicolas, and it would certainly make him very happy. At that night, the young student went to bed early, dreaming of the serendipity meeting at the hut. Next day he had breakfast with his mother before his classes. When he was on the bus, he thought about his reaction to see Zara again. “Does she really feel something for me? Or was that only a quick moment?” He couldn’t control his emotions. Nicolas decided not to tell anything to his friends. They certainly wouldn’t believe and would laugh telling him that was only a fruit of his imagination. Sanchez came into the room and saw his friend ready for the class. “You’ve arrived early, my friend. You always wait in the courtyard until everyone is inside. What happened?” “Nothing. I’m just sitting here, thinking about life.” They kept talking until Dr. Glein entered the classroom. He greeted everyone and began his speech, explaining how the Theory of the Relativity worked. The students observed his explanations with attention, but Nicolas was looking at Zara, who was sitting by his side again, stared at her beautiful eyes and remembered the date they had in the previous day. She was also looking at Nicolas, returning the smile. At break time, he looked for her in the school’s courtyard. “May I talk to you for a moment?” “Yes. Let’s go to the cafeteria.” “I can’t forget what happened between us and I’d like to see you again on the weekend.” “I also liked very much what happened with us. Would you like to meet me in the same trail we met on Sunday? Is that okay?” “Sure... I... I’ll be there in the hut.” Zara knew that Nicolas also liked her and, somehow, she was also getting involved with him, who was at least ten years younger. However, it seemed that she knew him for some time. They began to meet every weekend and Sundays were always happy days. They shared kisses, caresses and rode their bikes, enjoying every moment together. After some weeks of relationship, Nicolas began to feel curious about the woman who changed his life. She noticed it was the perfect moment to tell a special secret that would change his view of the world. “Nicolas, I have something to tell you. I’m not from here. I live in a very distant place.” “I was curious to know where you came from. You have a different beauty, as if you lived in a Nordic country. Please, go on...” “In fact, I came from a place much farther away than just a country. I’m from a planet called Vida, in the Andromeda galaxy, many light-years away from here. As you would say: I’m an astronaut! I would like you to meet some people who travel with me. Would you like to join me?” “What is all this madness? Is the dream falling apart? She might be mentally disturbed. This would explain everything. All that love can’t be real, anyway, the boy thought, devastated because he couldn’t believe in what she was saying. Nick didn’t understand why she was telling that. It was obviously not true, but she seemed very smart and very secure to be crazy. Was everything a kind of joke? A game? Maybe she only wanted to play a trick on him. Since there wasn’t anybody around, he pretended to believe, and answered with an ironic voice: “Are they close?” “Close your eyes.” She said smiling, holding his hands. In an instant, they were in another place. They were inside a hi-tech spaceship and no longer in that abandoned hut. The boy was shocked! If that was really a ship, he was certainly taken to the control room. The technology that could be seen was something amazing, and he could observe a number of instruments which functions he could barely imagine. One of the walls was partly made of transparent glass, which allowed the crew to observe the exterior. He came closer and saw that they were parked next to a cloud, which was probably hiding the flying object. Looking from above, everything seemed extremely small. He couldn’t see, but the aircraft had a discoid shape, which favored the aerodynamics of motion in outer space, making it easy to travel at high speed. Holographic screens lined the edges of the room, reflecting lights of all colors and shades. It was all very intriguing. Still feeling lost; he admired everything around him, inside the ship. Perplexed, he recognized the Milky Way, slowly turning in a projected holograph. This image highlighted a blue planet, which was located right in the Arm of Orion. He could recognize this planet in any image. It was the Earth. “The most beautiful and perfect planet of the Universe.” he thought while he analyzed the image projected in three dimensions. And he also recognized the Andromeda galaxy. A planet stood out in this holography, as if it was being monitored. There was something special about it and he was curious, however, he wasn’t comfortable to ask Zara, since he was so lost within his thoughts. He continued to observe the things around him. The glass walls and holographic screens covered a lot of the space but he also noticed something made of silver, a clear shade, which reflected light and spread it through the entire place. Those surfaces were smooth and shiny. “Is this some kind of technology to save energy?” He wondered. The size of that control room was something that also intrigued Nicolas; the room seemed to have more than a hundred square meters, and he soon imagined the size of the whole ship. He couldn’t see any buttons or bars and apparently the entire control was managed by haplographies. He felt a scent of jasmine in the air, Zara’s perfume. “What a nice smell!” he thought while breathing the pure air of the ship. Nicolas was still amazed and took some time to believe in what he was seeing. Everything was new, intriguing, and he couldn’t understand what was around him, although he was trying to absorb it all. Zara, noticing the young man’s insecurity, began to explain. “Nicolas, calm down. I know it’s too much, but I’ll explain everything to you.” His was lost, just staring through the ship. He couldn’t believe that what she said it wasn’t a joke, but the truth. There was more to know than he ever imagined. He was still confused, without understanding exactly what was going on, but he turned to Zara, waiting to hear the rest of the explanation. “We’re here in a mission, and I needed to find you, for a very special reason, that I’ll explain later. I joined the college where you study as a student and it was easy to get transferred, because we can access the IT systems of the Earth information. I did this with the purpose to get close to you. But when I secured this human body, I had the same sensations and wishes you have! It was inevitable to feel something for you; I surrendered myself with no inhibitions and it was great. Keep calm, please. Our commandant Sivoc will explain things better for you. Don’t be afraid.” He couldn’t understand what she was saying, but there wasn’t much time to think, because three men approached from a door he hadn’t noticed before. Judging by the technology he could see in the ship, he deduced that those beings weren’t from Earth either. And despite Zara’s words, that were trying to calm him down, he began to sweat, and his heart began to race. Nervous, he was considering a thousand possibilities, “Will they suck my mind or make any kind of experience? Will they take me into a trip through the space? I’m going to wake up, I must be dreaming. I trust in Zara, but now I know that I don’t really know her. What if this trust isn’t deserved? And what if her, along with these three unknown men, want to harm me?” There was no more time for his conclusions. Soon, one of them approached and, judging by his attitude it was clear to understand that he was the commandant. “Greetings! My name is Sivoc; I’m the commandant of this ship. We came from a planet located in a galaxy close to the Milky Way.” The commandant had a human appearance. He was an Asian, very tall and wore a navy blue uniform with a cloth that shone when touched by the light. He had a serious semblance and he was concerned when he looked at the other members of the ship, who stood behind him, in silence. Zara was also there, only observing the scene that was happening. “I’m... My name is Nicolas. I live here in Los Angeles.” He answered, quivering. The commandant smiled, trying to make him feel more comfortable. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you in person, Nicolas. We already know a lot about you, but let me introduce you the rest of the crew. This is Drako, the responsible for the trip’s control instruments and he is also our information engineer. The other one is Tibor, chief of security. The only female crewmember is Zara, the doctor of the mission and the genetic engineer, and you already meet her.” Nicolas looked at each one while they were being introduced. They all looked like humans, like Zara and Sivoc. Drako used hair cut close to the scalp; he was also very tall. He barely showed any reaction when Nick greeted him and he quickly went back to the navigation system, from where he could control everything with just his fingertips on the holographic panels of the ship. The last member, Tibor, was the tallest and had a very serious semblance; his skin was clear and framed by muscled that showed a lot of strength. “We come from the planet Vida, which is three millions years distant from your planet. I am talking about the light speed, of course.” Added Sivoc. Nicolas observed his hosts with attention, and there would be things, to be revealed later, which would leave him much more surprised than that vision, but at that moment he didn’t know about it yet. He continued observing the ship’s equipments, which were still so impressive, but it looks like the navigator could control all the tasks by the power of his mind, telepathically. “Drako, get us out of here, immediately.” Said Sivoc, trying to not get too much attention. He turned to Nicolas and explained his request: “Although the space technology from the Earth government is somewhat outdated for our standards, they have special radar that can detect us. And it important to no reveal our presence and we need to get out of here with some urgency. You can be assured, however, that we’ll not do you any harm.” The vehicle began to takeoff at high speed and rose into the sky. Nicolas was looking at the Moon through the window and saw that it was getting closer. In a matter of seconds, it began to grow and became more beautiful. Soon, he was looking at its craters, and they were huge and gray, like a big and sandy desert, without water and no life at all. Suddenly, the ship stopped. After traveling to the exosphere, he felt his body and soul relaxing a little, noticing that his dream had finally became reality, and it was much better than he had seen in books and movies. For the first time in his life, he was capable to observe closely the grandiosity of the cosmos: the sun and its brightness, the planets in our Solar System, the stars so distant. It was magnificent. The Moon was clear, illuminated by the sun, with rays of light shining around. It was a wonderful image; raters of different shapes and sizes were visible from inside the ship. The boy already liked to admire the natural satellite in the days of full moon, even by distance, but it was even so much better to look closely. On the right he could see the blue planet he called home, the giant home of billions of human beings. He felt like an astronaut, and then he thought about how euphoric they must have felt when they saw our planet and satellite, for the first time. After that, he left his admiration aside and began to think again in the reason of this contact. “What could those beings from outer space want with a person like me, an ordinary student who has no connections with scientific or technological researches?” For an instant, he observed Zara and remembered the kisses and the embraces they shared. She looked him in the eyes as she always did since they met and sweetly smiled, as if she understood his thoughts. Nicolas answered with a smile, but deep inside he was scared. Sivoc, as if he knew what Nicolas was thinking, soon approached and began to explain what the purpose of the mission was. “Nicolas, I know it sounds very weird the way we’ve approached you and especially the fact that we brought you inside the ship with no further explanations. The truth is that we need you to help us to solve a serious problem in our planet.” The human didn’t understand anything. All that mystery had no connection to him. He always dreamed about knowing the universe; but he never intended to travel to other planets, especially with people he barely knew. Regarding Zara, he didn’t even know if she was the woman he imagined. “How can I be useful to these beings that have so much technology?” he reflected. “Many of our ancestors had landed here on Earth.” Drako joined the conversation. “We have information that the government of your planet tried to capture us to obtain information about our technology and knowledge. We’re here in a mission, and you can help us to protect our planet.” That was when Nicolas became more confused. “How can I succeed in protect their planet? As I can see, they could be much more useful to help my planet, showing a way to preserve human life, especially regarding the population and consumption growth and to shortage of food and water. They have much more technology and knowledge. More than I have, obviously.” He thought. Zara approached him and said: “The truth is that we are actually humans, just like you but from the future.” He became astonished with that revelation. Those instants inside the ship seemed like hours, it was as if time had stopped. Nicolas was more comfortable. Maybe it was an effect of the pure oxygen he was breathing, which made him feel as if nothing around him mattered. That was definitely a unique experience, he couldn’t understand what was happening, but he was paying attention to the information. After knowing about something so tremendous, he needed to know more, and Zara continued: “According to you time calendar, live on the Century 641. We managed to travel in time due to the technological advances of our people. We discovered gaps in space-time, what the physicists of your planet call warm-holes. We travel these long distances between our planets very quickly.” Sivoc interrupted the conversation. “Zara, we’d better be honest with Nicolas. He need to trust us, and the truth about our mission will show him that our intentions are the best possible and that we come in good faith. First tell him our main purpose, and then reveal the whole story from the beginning, so our visitor will understand better why we are here and our connection with his planet. Besides, we know he is in danger. The other ship from our planet is looking for him and they won’t have the same compassion for Nicolas.”",

      "title": "– II. The Revelation –",
      "content": "– II. The Revelation – Nicolas didn’t know what was going on and was perplexed taking in the revelations. He looked at Sivoc with attention, waiting for the promised explanations, and trying very hard to understand what was being said. But what he wanted the most was to know why he was there. “In fact, Nicolas, you have an organic defense that’s completely different from the other human beings.” Sivoc said. “This unique feature made you became the object our future studies.” The boy became bewildered with the revelation! “How come he was different from the other human beings?” Nicolas thought. “The information about you contained in the medical files and shared in networks made you known as the bearer of the most powerful biological defense among all earthling beings on Earth.” The commandant continued his explanations while the boy looked at him with attention, avid for more. “Your blood contains an extraordinary series of lymphocytes, like no one else. Such series was called X-Lymphocytes, and it makes you immunologically strong against infections and diseases of all kinds.” Everything suddenly made sense to Nicolas. After all, while many colleagues had flu and other diseases, so common during childhood and teenager years like viruses, he had never got sick. He even pretended some indispositions to ditch classes, but the truth was that he had never been sick. “The future scientists concluded that some genetic mutation had happened in your defense cells, which would explain how your organism managed to develop this healing power.” Sivoc explained. “I guess I already know what they want with me. They would certainly want to make experiences with my blood in their planet. I don’t want to travel with them. I need to find a way to get out of here. I can’t lose the family I love so much! But how will I escape?” Nicolas considered. There was an explanation for such healing ability, but it would be revealed only in the future, and the group would still experience many adventures, before the secrets of the X-Lymphocytes were unraveled. Zara noticed the boy’s affliction and asked Sivoc to continue to explain everything to him. “Please, tell Nick about our purposes. He’s a good person and will understand we’re being sincere.” And then he continued: “We came for you as a request from the governor of our planet, the king Zador II. The princess Isadora, daughter of our king, contracted a rare disease caused by a virus. Not even the most modern resources available in the planet Vida were enough to cure her. However, we knew you existed and we also knew about the X-Lymphocytes. Since we owned the technology necessary to travel to the past using the gap of space and the mechanisms of fold space, we decided to reach you, the earthling being with the strongest immunologic defense. Even in our time, there was no other human with such capacity.” Nicolas had no idea of what was happening, especially because the strength of his immunological system would be discovered only a few years later. He noticed that he was somehow special, but he couldn’t understand how much. And he still feared what they could really want from him, because he didn’t want to become a laboratory rat and go through numerous and painful experiments. “King Zador II would certainly feel very pleased with those who could help to cure his daughter, and a large reward was offered. Thus, in a meeting with his counselors, he asked us to prepared two teams to travel to the past and find you.” “The team I am charge of was chosen by the counselor Kenan, very loyal to the king. He elected us based in our scientific and technological knowledge. They gave us the ship Science II, this one in which we’re right now.” At this moment, Sivoc opened his arms making Nicola’s eyes wander around the ship. “The other team was chosen by Mirov, a counselor who plans to steal the throne behind the king’s back, based in his military skills. They received the ship Challenge I, and his commandment Merko is a very experienced military ambitious, who is capable of anything to achieve his goals.” “Luckily, Challenge I had to go through some repairs and we were able to leave first. That’s why we reached you before them. Our purpose is simple we want to take you to our planet so you can donate a small quantity of your medulla cells. These cells are our only hope to cure the princess.” Nicolas was impressed with revelation. “So I won’t need to be a bait of experiments? They only need a donation?” the boy thought. While still thinking, the commandant continued: “Our biggest problem is that if the princess dies, the king will have no successors. The rules of our planet are clear. The new governor will have to be chosen among the members of the council. That was why Mirov wanted to separate a team, as a way to earn more prestige. We fear that the real intention of the crew Challenge is to eliminate you, destroying the only chance to save the princess. So, we want to protect you and assure the survival of our future queen.” At this moment, Zara decided to speak and tell him some more compelling arguments. “The virus that attacked Isadora seems to be a fairly aggressive mutant of the same virus that had already taken her mother’s life. It attacks the blood cells and can’t be fought by any of the traditional forms known by doctors. The princess is anemic and getting weaker every day. We believe that only the lymphocytes of your medulla may save her, because they’re very strong and resistant.” Nicolas felt himself very satisfied for being able to contribute in some way to help Isadora. At first he feared what they could do to him, but now that he knew they only wanted to save another life, and that he could help with a simple donation, he couldn’t deny the request. The sensation of saving a little girl life is a unique and he could barely wait to do it. Zara was introducing to him not only a completely different world, but also a way to be a better human.” “Tell me about her.” Nicolas knew that there were more important questions to be asked; all of them were fighting inside his mind. But at that moment, that was the only question that came out from his lips. “She’s a beautiful 7 years old girl, with lovely and kind face. She likes to play and really hopes to be cured.” Zara answered. “So, Nick, will you come with us? Please, help us to save our princess.” After knowing the real reason of the trip, Nicolas began to think how good would be to save a person, especially a girl’s life. He loved his sister and he could never think about her being sick and not helping. He had already decided. They were asking so little of him and it would be a pleasure to help in Isadora’s cure. He said: “If it is up to me she will be fine. I’ll do everything I can.” He said, with his altruistic spirit. “But promise me that you’ll bring me back. I need to take care of my mother and my sister. I’m the only one left in their lives and I can’t stay away from them.” “We’ll bring you back, I promise.” The boy was relieved after hearing from Zara the promise that they would bring him back home. He thought he would live the biggest adventure of his life, and then he could return to his family, on Earth. Nicolas had thousands of questions to make, but while he thought about them, a little robot, in the shape of a dog, leaned at his feet. “What’s that?” he asked, smiling, finding everything incredible. Now that his fears had vanished, he was very calm, and the curiosity returned in full swing. The robot’s approximation helped to relieve the mood, which was a little heavy because of the fear for the princess’ life. “I was scared when this thing touched me.” “We have some robots in our planet which are just like the old pets. They serve as companies, friends and also as weapons. This is Little Wolf. Sometimes he even participates in missions with us. But normally he stays inside here taking care of the ship and not allowing anybody inside.” “He’s scratching his head in my legs. It seems that he likes me.” Nicolas said, petting the head of the small creature, just like a dog from Earth. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t save all of the Earth animals. However, those we could not save from extinction, we managed to clone using the DNA and the robotic technology, creating bionic beings with some features of the extinct animal. Little Wolf had the gene responsible for that kind and domestic attitude, very peculiar to the Earth dogs. But don’t be fooled, Little Wolf’s eyes fire a laser of high precision and range. His bridle is equipped with infra and ultra sound hearing. He can be very useful in some missions. And he is a good companion, but also a very useful weapon.” Immediately, Nicolas moved away from Little Wolf, thinking it would be better not play with him. On Earth, the pets were definitely less dangerous. Zara smiled, reading his thoughts. The boy was much calmer and also happy to be able to help these people. And that robot made him sure that there was a lot to learn with that team. He would donate some cells to save a child, and he would be glad to do some good, and was sure he would learn a lot with during the trip.",

      "content": "III. The Development of the Human Being Sivoc knew they wouldn’t be able to stay there for long. The danger was stalking them in more than one form and it was necessary to think of a safe place to stay. The Earth government was eager to capture them, targeting the advanced technology they possessed. On the other hand, Merko and its soldiers were also on the way and would never work together with them. While Sivoc, Drako and Tibor talked about the best strategy to protect themselves, Nicolas and Zara stayed away from the discussion. Zara knew the commander’s desire to tell the young man about the transformation of the human being, the way it had evolved until what it was about to become in the future. She thought that was the best moment to begin to tell her story: “Nick, I’m so glad you agreed to help us. While the rest of the crew is busy I would like to tell you a bit more about the evolution of the human species. Would you like to hear?” Nicolas’s eyes beamed with expectation of learning! “Please, Zara, I’d love to hear more about what happened. However, I imagine that the human being hasn’t changed much, since you have the appearance of a normal person.” The geneticist laughed with his statement. It was funny, but made sense, after all, he haven’t seen the real shape of the crew yet. “You are wrong, but I will start this story from the beginning. We know all the biological mechanism of the species in this planet, so we don’t need to make experiments with humans. When we perform our missions, the main purposes are to collect gens so our planet can recover extinct breed by cloning. The Science II has an immense database with most of the terrestrial genomes.” “I’ll explain briefly how we develop ourselves from the modern Homo sapiens. The human brain has a surprisingly capacity for data storage. With the advance of information technology and the increase of the human knowledge, brain development was accelerated by each generation.” The boy listened to what Zara was saying and felt completely immersed in an unknown and fantastic world. Every moment, he became more and more curious. “Therefore, the inventions and technologies grow exponentially, and the human mind has developed more quickly, making the brain and, consequently the skull, a lot bigger in comparison with the face. Due to changes in the eating patterns that have already started in the last two centuries, the jaws began to atrophy because of the lack of chewing food, since became more industrialized and soft. Without the movement of chewing the last teeth of each series of arcades, incisors, premolars and molars have disappeared, becoming only dental elements for residues. The jaw was reduced to the size we have in the future because of the reduction of its function.” Nicolas had never heard about that in his short life existence. ‘What is Zara referring to? Will we become bigheaded with small chins?’ He thought. With her telepathic abilities, the geneticist noticed that he clearly understood how human evolution had occurred. And she decided to continue the conversation telepathically: “Your conclusion about the future is correct. That’s why I said that we are the future of the human race.” “Zara, you’re reading my mind and talking to me telepathically. This is simply fantastic. I’d love to do that too!” He was really impressed with such ability, but also confused. “I don’t understand! How can you be so evolved if look exactly like the people I know?” She smiled and, telepathically, began to tell Nicolas about how man destroyed the terrestrial ecosystem: “I’ll get there, but first I have more things to tell. We know that the sun around which the Earth still moves will last around 6 billion years, but in order to preserve the planet is necessary that the humans are aware of the renewal of ecosystems. In a few decades, man will begin to use nuclear energy more often, since there will be no alternative to supply the lack of oil. He will dominate the technology of nuclear fusion, which will allow a multiplication of energy sources and increase of radiation. However, with the ineffectiveness of the methods of radioactive control, mainly by countries, which will use this method without total understanding, there will be a greater destruction of the ozone layer. Consequently, a greater amount of solar radiation will enter the planet and will drastically modify the climatic conditions. This will make it hard on the planet survival and a search for another planet to become a base will start. It will become necessary the use of domes with filtered oxygen and protection against solar and cosmic radiation. With this, the work of heating the air through the nostrils, to better absorb the oxygen, will be extinct, determining the nasal atrophy and reducing the nose into two small holes in the middle of the face.” Nicolas tried to imagine how this human being from the future would be, but it wasn’t easy. And Zara still had things to say: “The binocular vision of the humans also suffered some adaptations. When the man finally began to live in space, his vision had to be adapted to this new lifestyle, improving perception of depth to see well and to see the most distant objects. This made the eyeballs becomes more distant and bigger. Human fingers also have atrophied due to the modification of the labor methods because with the automation of the productions there was no need for manual work. Across the generations, the function of the fingers was lost and the hand was left with only three fingers, without fingernails. With the use of telepathy to communicate, the ears degenerated and reduced the size for the entrance of sounds.” The boy imagined himself with the mentioned features and feared that what he had just heard was true. Maybe if he told it to his college friends, he would be called crazy. Nobody would believe, even if it were the truth. He looked at the aliens and couldn’t see such changes. ‘Are they using some kind of costume?’ thought the boy. It was difficult to accept everything that took place in several millenniums in just a few hours. While Zara and Nicolas talked about the evolution of the human being, Sivoc and the others decided to leave the exosphere and hide the ship at sea. They were trying to deceive Merko and find the best moment to return to the planet Life. They needed to leave the ionosphere with safety and this was the best alternative. Listening to the conversation between the two, Sivoc decided to interfere, summarizing the matter: “When you get to our planet,” said the commander, “you’ll see how we value the environment. We recycle everything that’s possible and take care of our race, animals and vegetables. Besides, we don’t make war with other species. The military force exists to protect the planet against possible alien threats, meteors or problems involving the planet, like epidemics or environmental disasters. Are you ready to see the appearance of the human being of our time?” Nicolas just nodded, agreeing. Telepathically, the captain asked everyone to put some kind of sunglasses in their eyes. Then, he ordered that they assumed their real appearances. That was when the young boy really understood everything. They were using a different appearance not to scare him, since their original form was really impressive, so different than what he was used, just the way Zara explained with so many details. Minutes after watching them, the boy looked at Zara and a tear fell from his eyes. He thought: “Like had ever happened in my life, when I think I will have a serious relationship, everything ends. Zara and I have nothing in common; I just now see how different we are.” She noticed Nick’s disappointment when she saw his sad semblance and told everyone telepathically to become human again. She felt something new for the human, an emotion she had never experienced before. After returning to the form of the beautiful woman for whom Nicolas had fallen in love, she saw him smile with the same innocence of young man she met in college. Somehow, seeing her as a human being, similar to him, gave him some hope of perpetuating the love he felt. However, the young man was amused with the use of this transmutation technology and pondered: ‘Would it be also possible for me to use these glasses and turn me into whomever I want to be? It’s unbelievable!’ Sivoc ordered Drako to take the ship into the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, at a latitude and longitude next the city of Tampico. While the ship was moving there, he showed to the boy how gravity worked: “With the knowledge initiated by the Theory of Relativity, by a scientist of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein, it was possible to understand the balance of space-time-gravity. Scientists managed to study the changes that large celestial bodies, with mass and weight sufficiently able to deform the space-time, can cause in the universe, creating gravitational fields. The propulsion engines of folds we use are able to create a bubble around the ship, contracting the space in front of it and expanding the space left behind. This allows achieving large intergalactic distances respecting the law of general relativity that doesn’t allow that objects with large mass travel almost at the speed of light. We managed to create an artificial gravity using discoid ships which have rotational centrifuge speed, which creates a gravitational force similar to the Earth and to the Planet Vida, and benefits the structure and the blood circulation of the human body.” We traveled through wormholes formed from the space-time curvatures between opposing gravitational fields forming passage bridges between distant galaxies.” Nicolas was a Physics student and loved those issues about time traveling, life in other planets, and the law of relativity, energy sources and artificial gravity. To listen and to know that those explanations were actually used was just wonderful. Zara enthusiastically showed the galaxy where they lived in the virtual screen. She pointed her planet, which was located at a similar distance to our Earth to the sun. That was Vida, the planet where they all lived. She accessed a few images, and Nicolas could observe that the planet had some resemblance with Earth, because there was a lot of water and of green areas with different types of forests. “Andromeda is a spiral galaxy and is located about 2.9 million light years away from the solar system, to which the Earth belongs.” Explained the geneticist. “It’s the closest galaxy from the Milky Way and it was named is due to the Constellation of Andromeda, which the galaxy belongs.” This constellation has its name originated from the mythological princess Andromeda. This galaxy is also known as Messier 31 and its number of stars is twice bigger than in our galaxy.” She finished by saying that with the environmental degradation of the Earth, the man was forced to look for other places in the space to live, and conditions of other planets in the Milky Way weren’t adequate to the terrestrial life. First the human being created a colony on the moon, then in Mars and, with the knowledge he was acquiring, he could go farther and farther. “This place was the best we found.” She explained. “Since we could produce water from large glaciers and we managed to heat the planet with sources of energy from nuclear fusion. This caused a cycle of evaporation of water, which added to forest plantations, genetically designed, and established a continuing photosynthesis, also due to a privileged position of the planet Vida, in relation to the sun of our system. We also managed to save some species of animals and plants that we take with us on our trips throughout the space. There are still several domestic animals on our planet, which in the future are also different from how you know today. They all have suffered changes with the evolution process. With a quite diverse database of DNA, it became possible to clone several extinct species and recover much of the lost biodiversity.” Said the doctor, who at that time was no longer the simple beautiful woman he had met while trying to escape the rain, but someone who captivated him more and more. *** While the crew of the ship was talking, the Multinational Space Station observed on its radar the presence of an UFO in the Earth’s stratosphere region. “Attention, control mission on Earth. There is a presence of a ship near the Siberian region. Is there any air-fighter available in the area?” Asked the French commander, Raonut, head of multinational space station. “Listening loud and clear, orbital station command. Here speaks the commandant of the Russian space mission, in Moscow. We have two Sukhoi fighters ready to intercept. Please confirm the order of destruction.” Said the head of the Russian space mission, Sergey Yurich. “We have two F16 fighters near Germany. We’ll send it immediately.” Said Lieutenant Colonel Smith, from American command.” “Try to capture the ship and the crew and. It would be a milestone in human history. If they are hostile, you can destroy the ship.” Raonut confirmed. “Okay, let’s execute the mission.” Yurich replied. “Understood.” Said the American space control mission. *** Drako, watching the conversation kept his attention on the ship’s holograms. “Commander Sivoc, we were identified by radars of the Multinational Space Station. Four fighters are coming our way. We need to get away as quickly as possible. Two of them are coming from the East and more two are moving west.” “Take us to the orbit of Jupiter. There we’ll be invisible to the radars.” Ordered Sivoc. In a spectacular speed, they left the Earth’s orbit and reached Jupiter, crossing the belt of meteors and entered the orbit of the satellite Ganymede. *** “Orbital Station, Yurich speaking from Russian Space Command on Earth.” “I hear loud and clear.” Raonut replied. “The UFO just disappeared from our radars. Can you see it?” “Negative, Yurich. I will ask the European and American commands to try to locate them.” “Smith in listening. I also missed the target on the radar. Abort the mission.”",

      "content": "IV. Another Ship on its Way to Earth Meanwhile, the ship Challenge I was ready to leave. The coordinates were already set on the wormhole formed near Jupiter’s moon, Calisto, where the gravitational curvatures between Andromeda and the Milky Way galaxy could be found. There was located the other bridge of space-time. Merko was anxious because of the delay and Mirov gave the final instructions: “Commander Merko, don’t forget to keep me updated through my particular communication channel. I want you to report the information about the mission directly to me. The other ship is unable to perform this kind of mission. If the people from Earth attack them, they will be captured; they are not prepared for the fight. Tibor can’t protect them alone.” “Lord Counselor, me and my team will do our best to get to the Earth with safety. No one will stop me from achieving my purposes.” “I want you to bring him dead or alive. If he dies, separate the bone marrow in the ship cryogenic laboratory, because what matters is the blood and his special defense cells.” Radof, Mirov’s assistant, got surprised with the order of his master; he knew that saving the princess’s life was not in his plans. When Mirov left to his chambers he talked to him after reading his thoughts: “I need the commander to bring me the earthling anyway. I need him to complete my plan to dominate the kingdom. Merko has to trust my noble intentions. Although everyone fears him for his strength and force, he is a man of principles. I’ll change the boy’s marrow bone and by the time the girl needs it the most it will be too late.” “Very insightful, sir. No one will suspect your plan and choosing Merko was a masterpiece.” “The commander has never failed. The conviction that he’ll conduct an honorable mission will help him achieve success. Now be quiet and prepare the communication room in my chamber so we can monitor everything.” Challenge I descended into the Earth’s atmosphere at high speed. They arrived in Alaska, where there was an extraterrestrial base inside a mountain. A huge door opened among the snow castles, allowing the ship to enter without any problems. Captain Crom reported to his commander: “Sir, having one of our bases here is highly strategic. We became immune to the Earth radars and we still have a place to hide ourselves and prepare our military tactics. We need to worry only in finding the earthling, without fearing for our safety.” “Previous missions were performed in order to build this. We visited Earth several times, that’s why we know the place very well. It is extremely important that we focus only on our mission. We’ll leave in a few moments.” The crew of Challenge I didn’t know the whereabouts of Sivoc’s team, but they believed that they had arrived on Earth before. However, it was necessary to seek information about the target. Merko and his team, all in human form, teleported themselves to the city of Los Angeles. They synchronized the coordinates and pressed some kind of watch they were wearing on their wrists. The technologies used on the sunglasses and watches teleportation were similar. When they entered the gravitational field of a planet, a satellite robot was able to absorb the cosmic radiation of the stars and use it as an energy source. A chip located in the sunglasses scanned and read the DNA of the cell or tissue of the human whose identity they desired to copy the robot processed the information. The information about the current latitude and longitude had to be transferred to the satellite in order to materialize the DNA anywhere in that area. Crom had the files with all the information about the mission: “Commander Merko, I’ve got some information with names, photographs and addresses of students who study with the human. We can try to get some information from them.” Merko raised a pen and an icon signal holography with the information they were discussing showed up on the screen. He touched one side of the picture and accessed the conversations between Nicolas and his friends on social networks, looking for something that would reveal the whereabouts of the earthling. The two of them leaned from the files and study the best strategy after and, after a lot of much deliberation, they reached a consensus. “Let’s find some information on the boy’s residence. His mother probably knows where he is.” Merko said. They went toward Nicolas’ house, in the suburbs of the city. Lorena was at home, and Sophia was at school. While the others members of the search group were watching the surroundings, Merko and Crom veiled themselves as police investigators and knocked on the door. They were dressed in black suit and tie, wearing polished black shoes, had their hair neatly combed and had identification badges with fake names. The mother answered the door, worried about the presence of investigators in her house. Thinking the worst, her eyes were filled by tears. For a moment, Merko looked at Lorena and felt something different, as if he already knew her from somewhere. But he decided to ignore the feeling and turn his attention to the search. Lorena also felt something different about the tall, strong man. His smell wasn’t strange to her, who was watching her closely, and she was trying to remember from where. Since they were police detectives, she thought she probably knew him from somewhere on the streets of Los Angeles. “Did anything happen to my son? He disappeared a few days ago and we don’t know anything about it.” “Madam, we came here exactly to seek information about your son. There was a report about his disappearance made by a friend from college, and our chief requested that our personal investigation. Do you know where he is?” “But... I thought you knew something about Nicolas. He disappeared and we’re waiting for some news that can give us some hope.” Crom looked at Merko raising his eyebrows. The commander telepathically read Lorena’s mind and found out that she really knew nothing that could help them. So they quickly said goodbye and left her alone. It was difficult to get any clue about the boy, and they needed to find him and complete the mission before the princess’s life faded. Crom was also concerned with their discretion while searching for their target on Earth: “Commander, it’s important not to leave traces of our presence here. We know that there is a special team investigating ETs, the Alpha-Omega, which could cause us problems. I still remember that story about the issues you had with them, when your best friend died in a mission here on this planet. We must be brief and objective.” Alpha-Omega was a secret team of the American government responsible for investigating any trace of alien presence around the Earth. Because they were directly linked to the Pentagon, they could request support from national security forces. When they imprisoned some specimen they used the secret military basis of Arizona, in the area 51 for seclusion and studies. “Dear Crom, you’re right. I’m a bit over the top with my actions and you are right, we will end up leaving traces. Let’s be subtler and try to go unnoticed. Then, Crom had an idea and spoke to the commander: “Why don’t you ask your contact in our planet about Sivocs’ coordinates? There is no greater advantage than information. He told you that they are here already.” “You are right. It’s a good idea.” He replied. Then Merko made contact with the counselor and said: “Mr. Mirov, I need help. I would like to find a way to penetrate the information system of the Council and discover where the ship Science II is.” “I’ll see what I can do.” The counselor confirmed. As they found no signs of the boy at the University, or around Los Angeles, they all agree that there was no other way to find him without further information. They decided to wait and monitor possible communications between Nicolas and his mother, or some info about Science II. .",

      "title": "– V. Nicolas and Zara –",
      "content": "– V. Nicolas and Zara – Nicolas looked everything around him and stared at Zara. She was a beautiful and intelligent woman that had messed with his deepest feelings. Afraid that Merko might want to capture the young man, Zara decided to create an alternative plan. She would conceive a child and carry the secret of Nicolas defenses in her own body. She was also attracted by his beauty and kindness, and was determined to keep him safe. Following the orders of the King and his advisor, Kenan, was her desire. He had walked and dressed strangely, but it didn’t matter. Deep in her heart, she was touched, but she felt upset because the laws of the planet Vida didn’t allow a romantic involvement with a human being from the past. She always kept her focus on the missions, but this time the feeling was very strong. Nicolas had never been able to have a girlfriend. When he met a girl he liked, he started to talk about the stars and always included some scientific explanation in his conversations. They ended up leaving him alone. Zara also had problems in finding a good man from her planet. When she saw someone new, she kept scanning their minds and hearts, to see if something attracted her, and, in most cases, she felt that they were superficial in their ideas romantic goals. *** Drako contacted the advisor Kenan, that warned him that commander Merko was already in Los Angeles. Then he approached the other crew members and reported: “Commander Sivoc, the Challenge I is already on Earth and Merko and his team are searching the city of Los Angeles. What should we do?” “Sooner or later, he’ll discover where you are. We need a strategy. We cannot hide the ship from Merko.” Sivoc replied. Listening to the information about the imminent danger, Zara began to feel palpitations on her heart. Fear rose through her spine and she began to sweat cold, her forehead becoming wet. The others looked at each other for a moment, worried. Even the tips of her fingers were pulsing, and she felt so many sensations that she could hardly think of anything. Suddenly she couldn’t swallow and thought that something terrible would happen. Nicolas looked at her, she was pale and her body was under severe stress. After a few minutes she began to demonstrate control of the situation and even seemed to enjoy the adrenaline circulating in her body. Gradually, she was getting back to normal. Nicolas was impressed with the changes in the doctor’s behavior: “What happened to you?” “Never mind, Nick. This happens to me once in a while. In the beginning, I got scared and panicked, but now I know that nothing will happen and I actually enjoy the temporary sensation of energy that provides me. It’s an anxiety crisis. I got nervous knowing that Merko is so close. Everyone knows he’s very successful in his missions.” “The humans from Earth also experience these kinds of reactions, especially in stressful situations.” The boy replied. “This is a reaction to the release of neurotransmitters into the bloodstream, just like the attack and defense against the dangers of our ancestors who hunted and lived in caves. These are our psychic and animal identities mixed with the evolution. This reaction, which could even paralyze many humans, is just another obstacle, even for the most evolved beings, to be overcome with our emotional growth.” Zara added. “I thought these psychological problems, such as anxiety crisis and depression, didn’t exist in the future.” Nick said. “The human mind is a great source of learning. Individuals have to live their own emotions. Of course we have problems in the future that are the results of our choices and decisions in life. In our ship, we have medications for all kinds of physical and psychological disorders, however, in this case the best remedy is to learn to use our own thoughts to deal with the conflicts and try to solve them.” Zara concluded. “How can I be close to a woman so beautiful from such a different land? She’s the most beautiful woman I ever saw. How can she be from another planet but still being a human being? And besides it all she’s so smart!” Reflected Nicolas. He was confused, but he was completely charmed and bewitched by her; the scent of jasmine made him curious, because he liked the fragrance and always felt it when she was. The two of them talked quietly while the other members of the crew moved away to the other side of the room. “I approached you first, with the purpose of having a child, but our meeting was so exciting that and after all I could not stop thinking about you. With you by my side, despite our age difference, I am 32 years old, I feel like a young woman full of dreams and hopes. The feelings that we have in our hearts remain the same, in the past and also in the future.” With these words, Nicolas felt a chill and asked: “But why having my child?” “I came to you because I needed to take your genetic code with me. If you didn’t come with me, there would be a second chance for Princess Isadora.” “Everything seemed so real, but now... I feel I was nothing but a mission!” he said. “Please, don’t you ever think that! When I met you, I felt something very deep in my soul. What I did was for love, first for you, then for the princess of my world. But if something serious happened, I needed to have another plan to save little Isadora’s and that’s why I decided to get pregnant.” “Are... you pregnant?” “Yes! I already can feel it inside of me. Deep in my gut. And... I feel happy for the opportunity to be a mother.” Her words radiated, like something he never felt before. She had fallen in love with him. And he didn’t know if he wanted to protect himself from something so beautiful. But how could he feel in love with someone from another planet, whose appearance weren’t real? Many secrets about Nicola’s past would be revealed and he would understand why he fell in love with Zara. She continued to speak: “Although I’m taking the stem cells from our son, we’d also like you to go with us to guarantee the solution of our problem. We think that making a transplant of your bone marrow is the best way to save princess Isadora.” Now Nicolas was afraid to be separated from this beautiful and unique woman. He wanted to help in whatever they needed, but he couldn’t lose her, once he had found her, just like as a grain of gold in the desert. He placed his right hand over hers. Zara looked at Sivoc and saw that he was talking to Tibor and Drako. She gently pulled her hand. “Will you come with me? If you do, I’ll do anything for you.” He said. “My dear Nick, I have my life on my planet, my job, my mission, my parents and my brothers. I don’t know if I would able to live away from them, and there’s another problem. The laws of my planet forbid a person to have a relationship with humans from the past in the missions we perform.” “Please, just think about it. You’re not on your planet and we are thousands of light-years away from it. Look at what I’m doing! I’m also leaving my family to go to a place that I don’t know, putting my trust on you.” Zara didn’t expect that this short time relationship messed so much with her mind. Nicolas didn’t understand where he found so many words and feelings when he spoke to her. He soon realized that he was in love with an alien woman. Sivoc decided to interrupt their conversation and requested: “Zara, come with me to the clinic. We need to talk.” Once there, he began to say: “I know that at first you planned to take a child with the genetic code with you, however, you know that we’re not allowed to have any kid of romantic relationships with our ancestors. This is against the ethics of our mission.” “Commander, I don’t really know what’s happening, or even what will be the consequences. However, I got pregnant from because the counselor Kenan requested. His friendship with King Zadora II is so great that he put the life of Princess Isadora above all. I’m a little confused about what I feel for Nicolas. But I’ll try to solve this situation.” Zara said with an aching heart. “We can’t allow a loving union between people of different eras. This could change the future and create temporal paradoxes, and the consequences are unpredictable. I’ve seen some emotional involvement in your acts. Why using an alternative plan when taking him would already solve the problem?” Asked the commander. “Commander, if we have any problem and we can’t transplant the bone marrow, the cells will be taken from the umbilical cord of the child that I carry. Thus, this plan is another guarantee for the success of the mission. This idea came from the counselor Kenan and it was in secret between us, so no one knew until I could achieve it. We have to keep it as a secret.” Sivoc was satisfied because the alternative plan was auspicious and, besides, was made by chief of the mission. *** Back in the control room, Sivoc talks with his fellows about the future: “In a few weeks there will be a gap in space-time, with a new gravitational cycle, and it will be positioned precisely between the planets Jupiter and Vida. We can make a perfect trip back to our planet.” The waiting time made Tibor concerned about the training of the earthling for a possible fight against Merko’s team, so he said: “We need to be alert and prepared for Merko’s arrival. He will save no efforts to take Nicolas with him. I’m thinking of training the earthling so that he can defend himself against a possible attack. Do you agree, Nick?” He asked. “Certainly, especially because I don’t see any other way.” He laughed. “I’ll always be by your side.” Zara told him. “We have many ways to defend ourselves, but the crew Challenge is very well trained.” Then, they understood that it was necessary to prepare Nicolas for Merko’s arrival because the waiting time until the gap was open would be long. *** The Counselor Mirov was monitoring the communications of Science II with Vida and had intercepted the message from the advisor Kenan. Mirov contacted Merko and said: “Commander Merko, the girl won’t survive for too long without proper treatment. King Zador is very affected by the situation. We need to help him because the Council has yet to decide what will be done in case the king become unable to govern, because of his daughter’s illness. Everyone knows how much he cares for her.” “Certainly, with another loss, the King will fall into a deep depression. My chances of governing will be big if we execute this mission. I need my plan to work so I can stand out among the members of the Royal Council.” The counselor thought. “We managed to intercept a communication from the ship and Sivoc.” “Please, give me the coordinates.” Merko asked. “Radof still didn’t manage to establish precisely where the signal came from. But, according to him, in a few hours it will be possible to get this information. Wait for my contact.” “Yes, Mr. Advisor! We’re anxiously waiting.” Answered the commander. *** In a meeting, the crew of the ship Science II agreed that some other measures would be necessary for the survival of the human. “We could put a chip in Nicolas and he can turn into one of us, including voice, movements and knowledge about space technology, self-defense and fly our ships!” Drako said. “So, he would have the information about interplanetary travel acquired during these thousands years.” Tibor came walking toward them and said: “We’d add all the theories of combat in this cybernetic implantation. Then we’ll proceed with your training. Someone needs to teach this kid how to defend himself from the dangers that are about to come. I’d love to do it!” “What you think about it, Nicholas?” Zara asked. “Will I learn to read minds like you do?” “Yes, but you’ll have to make some adjustments on your mind, and you’ll also know the main techniques of fight. Tibor will train you.” “I’m a little scared. Do you believe things can go wrong?” “My dear Nick, I’ll take care of you personally. I’m an specialist in this type of surgery.” Zara replied smiling carefully. Nicolas smiled in return. He was curious to use the technology of his new friends, and learning how to fight was a privilege for a young man. And they began to make the preparations for the procedure to implant the chips in Nicolas. Zara used a pistol with a sedative in his arm in order to him relax. Then gave him an anesthetic and put him on the operating table. The capsule with a chip was inserted in the brain, between the union of the frontal bone and the two parietal bones beneath the scalp, reaching the region of the brain responsible for the control of the thoughts. This would improve his vision, hearing, and smell, intellectual and cognitive abilities. An implant of another chip in the hippocampus has been done to improve and multiply his memory. A few hours later, the boy woke up and thought: “It seems that many things have changed in my head. Everything I see brings me more information.” Zara began to explain to him about the procedures: “We put in your iris the ability of genetic transmutation. You can become one of us when you need. For this, you’ll use these special glasses, which when placed in your eyes, will activate your transformation.” She looked at his reactions when she talked, he was a little scared, but willing to live the experience. “On the right side there is a red button, which when it’s pressed activates the transformation.” The glasses were black and he kept them carefully in his pocket, anxiously waiting to use them. The boy began to realize that he knew the mechanism of functioning of all the things that he looked at and touched. His mind had become faster. In the first moments he seemed a little confused, and didn’t understand what the others were saying. He stopped, fixed his eyes on the things and scrutinized their contents and then he came back to be himself. He smiled and felt the power that the knowledge provided to him. Now it was time to return to the social world and prepare him for the difficult days that were about to come. Zara put her hand on Nicolas’ right hand. He took him to the front of the ship and tried to help him: “Don’t worry about so many changes, Nick. I will stand by your side to help you to. Better than to know how to fight is the knowledge that can help you find solutions to unusual problems.” Tibor also gave Nicolas a watch that was able to teleport him directly to the ship or any other place on Earth. A blue selector of light indicated the ship and the selected the latitude and longitude of the place coordinates. After the first transport, the instrument created a memory that was subsequently selected with a single touch. Then, Tibor began to train him expecting some possible problems facing the commander Merko and his staff, experts in many fights. .",

      "content": "– VI. The Almost Ordinary Life in New York – The aliens from Science II continued to plan how to hide until the day they would return to their planet. Sivoc knew that Merko would find their ship and, therefore, together with the team he decided that it would be safer to leave the ship and just move to New York, a city with a large number of inhabitants. They were trying to hide among so many people. Sivoc rented an apartment next to Madison Square Garden, on 8th Avenue, and the four aliens decided to wait there, together with the earthling, for the right moment to teleport themselves to the ship and make the journey back home. The commandant asked everyone to go out as little as possible. Drako entered the terrestrial identification systems, and they all received new identities. *** At night, on a Friday, Zara and Nicolas went to the movies. In the sky, a full moon created an atmosphere and made them even closer. He saw only her beauty that attracted him from the first time, and he didn’t want to think that soon things could change. The two of them were walking through the Central Park when Zara held his hand and said: “Nicolas, I don’t know if we should have a relationship like this.” “But, Zara, nothing matters more to me than being by your side, here or anywhere.” And soon he touched her lips, kissing her and tasting all the honey that came from her mouth. The trees around them covered the path with the leaves that autumn left, and the fresh air was the best he had ever breathed. They decided to watch a romantic movie, since Zara never saw that like humans on Earth. On the planet Vida everything was planned and artificial compared to the kind of life she was experiencing. When the movie finished, they returned to the apartment. Zara was worried about the commander’s reaction but the desire was stronger. She remembered the times they met the hut and her need to be near him. Besides, Sivoc, Drako and Tibor were at the city, and that was the perfect opportunity for the two them to stay together. Nicolas prepared a plate with many and took to Zara’s bed in a cozy room in the apartment. He also opened a bottle of red wine and served it to his beloved one. Before eating, he touched her red hair and kissed her, feeling the heat of her body. “You like to feel different flavors at the same time.” Zara teased. “Despite the divine taste of this wine, I still prefer the taste of the honey in your mouth.” Nicolas whispered. He lay down beside her and touched the white skin of her shoulders. He kissed her neck removing, with his fingers, the soft hair from her blue eyes. He kissed her full lips and looked at her briefly, like a male hypnotizes his female. Zara’s movements showed her sensuality and fragility. Nicolas put aside his shyness and feeling once again the scent of jasmine; he pulled the strap of her lilac blouse and undressed her. For few times in his life he felt excited and absolutely happy. Zara also reached her release felt a thrill that this time everything was different. She didn’t have to stop, because she felt pleasure and comfort with a sense of reward for being next to him. They smiled and lived one of the happiest nights of their lives. “I love you!” She confessed, whispering in his ear. “I want to live my life beside you. I love you too.” After making love without feeling thinking about the time, Zara lay down over Nicolas, and they slept embraced throughout the entire night. *** Meanwhile, the three aliens walked through the city streets. At night, there were many open bars and they decided to go into one of them. A neon light at the entrance announced the name of the bar: Night Drink Bar. Sivoc wore jeans and brown leather coat. Tibor and Drako wore black leather jackets. When they entered the bar, all the customers looked at them because they were tall and handsome. It didn’t took long until three pretty women sat at the table with them: “Can we join you?” One of them asked. “As you wish.” Drako said, smiling. “You are outsiders, aren’t you? You act different from the people that live here in town.” Said the nicest of the three women, Sonja. “We came from a land very far away. We’re just stopping by.” Sivoc said. “If you want, we can show you the most beautiful places here.” Sonja replied. Tibor took a double shot of whiskey in a single gulp. Drako did the same and told the others: “Wow! This drink is really good. I’ll ask have another one.” “Take it easy. We can’t be distracted because Merko may appear at any moment. Don’t forget we are on a mission.” Sivoc also replied using telepathy. The three men from the planet Vida continued to have fun that night and dated the women. The music was pleasant and they decided to enjoy that evening at the bar. Drako and Tibor were distracted and relaxed, impressed by how the humans of that time were able to have fun. Sivoc also enjoyed the night, but remained very alert. *** Nicolas was training with Tibor all kinds of fights daily. Although he had the theories in his mind, he also needed to train his body and acquire physical fitness, to harmonize his body and learn how to dominate his inner energy. They attended a Martial Arts Academy on the 5th Avenue every morning. From the first exercises, in a few days he already showed a good physical performance and managed to practice his teachings with others at the gym. One day, one the teachers named Alex, who since the beginning had shown some animosity towards Nick called him for a fight, and he was unable to resist the invitation. Tibor didn’t interrupt, because he thought his student needed to be tested. The teacher hit him, but the boy began to feel that he knew which places to hit in the opponent’s body and didn’t hesitate. Alex was very good with his legs and arms and defended himself very well. The fight was difficult, and Nicolas thought about how he could knock him down. Without hesitation, he grabbed the arms of his opponent, and using the boost of his strength threw him to the ground. Soon, he jumped to immobilize him and hugged his neck to perform an arm lock, naked choke and managed to finish the blow. That was when Alex quickly hit his leg three times, giving up the fight. So, Nicolas apologized and offered his hand to lift him up. “Yeah, master Tibor, your student learns fast and is using the right arm and the arm lock very easily, very good.” Said the astonished teacher. After noticing that the earthling was very advanced in the techniques, Tibor decided to take him to a desert place for them to practice in harsh environment using the best weapons they possessed. From that day, the two pressed their watches and teleported themselves to a deserted place in the Grand Canyon, in the state of Arizona. They trained in the gym and then went to the desert every day. Tibor taught him how to use weapons and a spear, which was formed from some kind of pen that was unfolded, with two ends of the laser beams. There was a laser pistol and a ring of sound waves that was used to unbalance the opponent, and also a baton that released cosmic rays towards its targets. These were very powerful weapons. The essence of Tibor’s training was to show his student that the most important thing in the art of combat training was to maintain the honor, character and selflessness.",

      "title": "– VII. The Danger is Near –",
      "content": "– VII. The Danger is Near – Nicolas and Zara took a Saturday afternoon off and went for a in the Central Park. At this day, several famous actors were preparing to perform in a play outdoors. It was a normal thing for the New Yorkers and tourists to wait in queues for hours to watch the show. As they walked hand in hand, he looked at Zara and suggested: “What if we watched this play? The author is a famous English writer of the sixteenth century, William Shakespeare.” “I loved the idea.” Zara replied. “But we have to wait in this long line because I heard someone saying that people got here early in the morning.” “No problem. In your company I don’t notice the changes on the clock. I’ll let Sivoc know that we’ll arrive a little later tonight.” Zara got in touch with the commander so he wouldn’t be worried and explained they would watch a play at the park. Sivoc asked them to be careful and avoid any kind of problem. The couple stood in line with the people who waited anxiously for the start of the event, in an open-air amphitheater, in the middle of the park that had become a local tradition. Nicolas bought ice cream for the two of them, and they spend the nice moments together. They watched the play and after the show, were walking quietly, when Zara said: “Nick, we need to go back. It’s very late.” Nicolas loved when she called him Nick; he thought that it was a loving way of Zara calling him. “Are you okay, Zara?” “Not so much. I feel a little weird, but I believe I’ll get better.” She said, closing her eyes and breathing a little deeper. “Even dominating the anxiety crisis, the consequences aren’t easy to control. I’m also not feeling very well probably because of the pregnancy.” He looked deeply at her with such tenderness, although he was concerned about her condition. In fact, he wanted to protect her in every way. His hand was on hers, rubbing with his thumb on her hand. She seemed to be a strong woman, but she was fragile and he wanted to take care of her. The hours passed while they were together and it was already dark. Suddenly, three men approached them and one of them said: “Two lovebirds lost in the park, what a beautiful couple you make. Give us all your money now, without hesitation.” “Do not worry, Zara.” Nicolas said. “It’s okay.” “Now! We’re not joking, be fast.” The other boy said, pointing a gun to them. Zara held Nicola’s hand and began to sweat. Her forehead was wet and her fingers throbbed. She felt her heart beating fast and swallowed hard. This time it was difficult to stop the symptoms with her mental strength. Nicolas looked at the boy in front of him, with anger, and soon his gun began to levitate. The same happened with the weapons of the others, which were threw more than ten meters away. Then the three men began to be raised off the ground. The boy watched and lifted them up, leaving them scared and screaming. They were thrown up to the top of twenty-five meters tree, near the bridge. They stood there hanging like fruits. Zara slowly returned to normal, and then Nick said: “What was that? I’m really scared! How did you manage to pull those men as if they were feathers so high in the trees?” “It wasn’t me. I’d never be able to do this. I think you’re the one who did it!” Zara replied. “Let’s run, Nick, we can’t be seen. We need to get out of here fast. There is a subway entrance right ahead where we can hide and teleport ourselves to home.” Then, they arrived at the apartment. Zara was impressed with what she saw, because basically no one in her planet had the power of telekinesis. She only knew one person who could do that: Merko. Almost everyone knew how to use telepathy, but telekinesis was a very special skill. She heard on planet Vida that Merko was able to move objects and throw them against his opponents. Some reported that he could canalize the cosmic radiation and launch powerful rays with his hands, disintegrating his enemies. Besides, he had the ability to control the force of gravity. He had become a legend in his planet. In the comfort of the apartment, the boy continued to talk about how they escaped from the three men: “You said you believe it was me who did that. How could I? What kind of power is that?” “It’s telekinesis. The power to dominate the gravitational forces.” “Zara, you must have this power, and you can only use it in moments of high emotional tension or anger.” “No, Nick. It was you. Somehow you developed this ability. I know only one person on my planet that can do this and everyone fears him. Later we’ll have to understand this better. For me, it would be impossible to believe if I didn’t see with my own eyes. You will have to control this power, because it’s very dangerous.” “Who has this power?” “Merko, the man who’s looking for you. Do you understand now why we are so concerned about his arrival and the consequences for all of us?” The boy nodded. He was afraid because he didn’t understand the reason of his power and how he managed to use it so effectively. He was tired and looking at the doctor, he said: “I’m feeling exhausted.” “Please go rest, we need to relax, especially you. The telekinesis requires a lot of energy, even more from someone untrained like you.” Zara explained. *** Nicolas went to his room planning to sleep, although it was still a little early. Using telekinesis really had used all of his strength. Already in bed, he thought for a few moments about how much he missed his mother Lorena and his sister Sophia and he started to cry. “How will I be able to stay away from them? How long will it take until I can go back home? I miss my family. I wish I could get in touch to say that I’m okay, but I know it would only expose them to danger. Sivoc’s right, it’s better to leave them without news. I just hope they’re not suffering too much.” These and other reflections, about the family he had to leave behind, tormented him while he fell into a deep sleep. *** Zara looked at Nicolas for a moment when he was sleeping. She wondered what had happened during their walk and decided to tell her friends, who were resting in the living room. After reporting the fact to Sivoc, Drako and Tibor, the last one said: “Sure this ability is incredible, and the implant of the chips can’t be the source of this power.” “But what’s the explanation for this?” Sivoc asked. “Drako, you’re the specialist in Information Systems, would you know how to answer me?” “I don’t know anything about telekinesis. I just heard the stories about Merko’s power, as everyone in the planet. I’ve never seen how it works and, for me, it was a legend.” Drako said. “Anyway, even not knowing the origin of such force, we need to train the earthling. I’ll help him to channel this power and use it as best as possible without losing so much energy.” Everyone agreed with Tibor’s words, and Zara was glad, because with the good use of this power, he could defend himself better. Thus, she decided to tell the news about his new training when Nicolas woke up.",

      "content": "VIII. Nicolas’ Extraterrestrial Shape When he woke up, Zara told him about the necessity to learn how to use his new power. He agreed and Tibor started training him on the same day in the desert, where they went daily for heavier workouts with laser guns. Tibor asked him to move a large stone that was positioned on top of a mountain. “Nicolas, you are able to use the cosmic energies released on the planet by the stars and channel them into your body. Concentrate on this strength and have faith in your power. Let this energy flow through your guts and throw your hands against the object you want to move or destroy.” The boy did exactly what he said, focusing his mind on the stone and trying to pull the energy of the Cosmos. Although he felt a strong shaking inside his body that spread throughout his blood stream, nothing different happened. “I can’t do that again. I wasn’t the one who did it.” “Concentrate yourself and believe you’re capable. You’ll do it if you want.” Tibor replied. However, the boy couldn’t do it and he wanted to give up. His instructor insisted that it was possible and also knew that believing was the principle of any mental strength. He insisted so much that Nicolas looked at him with anger and blurted: “There’s no use in stay here trying. You’re asking too much from me, when the truth is that my life changed and I don’t know if this is what I want. I want to go back to my normal life! You’re all crazy to believe that I am able to move objects.” “Now, look again at that stone and move it.” Tibor ordered, taking advantage of the opportunity of the release of the anger he just provided. The boy looked at the stone with three meters of diameter and felt the energy circle through his body. The object began to rise from the mountain, when he raised his left hand. The stone seemed to be made of Styrofoam and with his right hand, Nicolas released a cosmic blue beam in the direction of the stone and smashed it into pieces. “Wow! Didn’t I tell you could? After using this force several times, you’ll able to master it, and this will make part of your life and will help you to defend the dangers that are about to come.” The boy felt stronger. He understood that something quite extraordinary happened in his life and he’d have to learn to live with his new powers. *** Life in New York was quiet and they had to be very discreet not to reveal their position. Sivoc met the crew of the ship, including Nicolas, who the captain already saw as part of his team. The confrontation with Merko should be imminent they had to discuss the strategy. Would a confrontation be better? “What is it, Commander?” Tibor asked. “I received a message from our planet telling me that Merko already has information about our location. I believe that there’s no other way to deal with his team but face them, they always managed to get to their targets.” Sivoc replied. “I’m sure we can fight against them, I’m going to prepare the earthling to defend himself and we all have knowledge of self-defense.” Tibor said. “I still think we’d better try to escape, because this fight is dangerous and we can all die. Maybe we can hide ourselves; we’ll have enough time until the day of our trip back home.” Zara said. “I’ll try to find out whatever I can about the location of Merko’s ship.” Drako interrupted. “Things seem to be more difficult for us. Kenan said that probably there is a traitor among them, he discovered that someone managed to intercept our communications with the planet Vida.” “I think the best thing to do now would be to teleport ourselves to Science II, where the communication and tracking equipment is being kept. We need to contact Kenan once again and this will only be possible from there.” “Good point, Drako. I think this is the best option at the moment. Let’s all go to the ship, so no one will be caught off guard or alone here.” Sivoc agreed. “Nicolas, this is a good opportunity for you to transform yourself for the first time. You need to adapt to the new extraterrestrial form that you’ll use on the planet Vida. You’ll have to live like everyone else.” Zara said. So, they all positioned their glasses, synchronized their clocks and returned to the ship. Nicolas also had to put his transmutation glasses, which he had won from his extraterrestrial friends, right after the surgery. He felt as if he was one of them. He didn’t quite understand why, but he acquired a great fondness with them.” He looked through the window that reflected his forms and noticed that his large eyes had more lateral field of vision. His big brain seemed disproportionate to the rest of the body. He raised his hand and saw the three fingers that now he possessed. He stuck his tongue out and noticed it was small, suited to its oral cavity. Now he was the one who was transformed, so he got scared and wondered if he would be able to get back to his human form. He put his fingers over the nostrils, which were only two small holes. “Where are my ears? And what if the others disappear and leave me here with this form? How will I live my life like this?” He wondered. Although a few weeks have passed since his operation, Nicolas hadn’t seen his new form yet. He was appalled and amazed at the same time. He never thought that he could go through so many experiences and adventures in his life at the same time. Discovering life on other planets, state-of-the-art technologies and explanations about the evolution of mankind. He imagined that when he arrived at the planet Vida, he would certainly discover more things. *** Meanwhile, on the planet Vida, the King Zador II thought of his daughter and wanted some news about the search of the earthling on the planet Earth. He really trusted in Kenan, one of his counselors who were the son of a close friend of his father. Kenan had great confidence in Sivoc, because of his missions, always putting the value the life factor. Kenan, as per the King request decided to contact the Science II ship. At that time, all of them were already inside the ship when a red light in the holographic screen started flashing, accompanied by an intermittent beep. It was the advisor appearing on the screen.” “Someone answer please.” He said. “Listening, Lord Kenan.” Drako answered. “Did you find the earthling?” “Yes, sir. He’s under our care.” Sivoc said. “We’re waiting for the next space-time gap that should occur very soon.” “Watch out for Merko’s team. They must be close. I hope you can accomplish the mission without problems. King Zador told me that he’s hoping for the success of your team.” Kenan replied. *** Immediately Radof took the communications interceptor device to his master and they discovered the location. Within minutes, they identified exactly where the signal came from. Mirov contacted Merko informing the news about Sivoc’s ship. Merko’s intention was to capture the earthling, kidnapping him. And freeze the crew of Science II inside their ship. They would be back to the planet Vida one year after the success of the mission of Challenge I. So, they wouldn’t create problems. The danger was coming closer! *** Once they finished the contact with Kenan, the crew of Science II returned to New York. Still gathered, they discussed all the possibilities and decided that the best alternative was to remain hidden. Without detection they tried to continue the life they had in that great city. For safety, they left a recording system activated to protect them from a possible sabotage, if Merko found Science II. Little Wolf, the robot-dog was also on the ship to defend it from possible intruders. One day, Drako went to a lottery and hit the jackpot and earned a good fortune. A few days later, he went to the bank to receive it and distributed money to his friends. Everyone needed some money to survive in the planet. Sivoc, noticing what he had done, decided to question him while the others listened with attention: “Where did you get so much money, Drako?” “Sir, I researched in the past database the winning numbers from the day before yesterday and use them. I thought we could use the money to survive here in this planet. Everything here has a price.” “I believe your intentions were good, because you wanted to help us in our mission. But I don’t think that a competitive advantage over the others participants of the betting is fair. You must return what you won.” They all were surprised, and Tibor was already looking at his beautiful watch, which he bought at a store on 5th Avenue. They were embarrassed by the order of their master and in fact they knew nothing about the origin of the amounts distributed by Drako. “But, sir! I haven’t done anything wrong.” “You know that our principles about acquiring things by dishonest means. Return what you won to its real owners.” Zara decided to intercede: “Commander, it’d be better if he distributed what’s left of the amount to charity organizations, it would be difficult to explain to the lottery why he was returning the award. They could find it strange and inform the press, which would cause us a big problem. We can split a small amount for our survival here on this planet just what is necessary to fulfill our mission. If we make copies of their currency would also be a questionable mean of acquiring resources. Tomorrow we should make a deposit for an institution that supports abandoned children or a Non-governmental organization that works with refugees from wars. “Sir, I agree with Zara,” since our mission has to be discreet, distributing the proceeds for the people who needed will be the best solution, and no one will know where the resources came from. We just need to know the bank account of the NGO.” Nicolas said. “Okay. I think it’s the best decision. Do like they said, Drako. Search in the database files, which institutions are in need of financial help and their respective bank accounts. However, I don’t want you to take this kind of decision again without consulting me first.” Tibor looked at his beautiful watch and, embarrassed, asked: “Sir, how will I be able to return this watch?” “Fine. You can have this one. I wouldn’t know what to do with it. Honestly, Tibor, our teleportation watches are much more beautiful.” Sivoc replied and continued, smiling. “Besides, isn’t it heavy for your arm to use two watches?” Tibor was quiet and hid one arm behind his back with half a smile in his face. *** Nicolas wanted to be active while they waited for the day to travel to planet Vida. Reluctantly, Sivoc allowed him to find an activity. However, he was quite firm in the need for him to be discreet and to keep away from problems, to do not catch the attention especially of his enemies. This was even more critical now that they knew about the boy’s telekinetic powers, which needed to be controlled at all costs. Nicolas began working as an intern in the Laboratory of Technology Research in Gravitational Physics. He couldn’t stay away from physics, which, professionally, was what he loved the most. Working as an intern he could see the researches without disobeying the orders of the commander. On his first day of work, using the fake name of Carlos Miguelito, and ID prepared by Drako, he was cleaning one of the labs and listened with attention to the explanations of the professor of Quantum Physics, who was showing the trainees the gravitational fields of the Relativity Theory. He imagined himself as a college student asking the teacher about the evolution and the possible reaction to think that the human being would evolve into what society considered as an alien. For a few moments he stared at the board, traveling in his own thoughts: He imagined himself attending the class when he decided to ask: “Professor, have you ever wondered how would it be if the man evolved following the tendency of the brain enlargement of primates from which we descend? And the atrophy of the dental arches by changing our eating habits, reduction of the size of the fingers for the use of robotics? Absence of nails by the loss of the claw function?” “What do you mean, boy? Carlos Miguelito, right?” The teacher said: “Go ahead, I want to hear what you have to say.” “Yes, sir.” Nicolas replied. “What if, crossing the warp space-time-gravity, we could go back to the past using the modern ships, with discoid shape, to travel the universe in all directions? Have you ever imagined that flying plates can be piloted by evolved humans from the future?” “My young boy, this is impossible. You must be joking”. The professor replied smiling. He continued to laugh for a few seconds and said: “You have a very fertile imagination. Imagine if aliens were ourselves, the human beings? This is crazy.” He returned to reality, grabbed his broom and continued to clean the lab. Deep inside he wondered: “A few days ago I would agree with you. This is good, the secret of my friends are safe.”",

      "content": "– IX. The Alpha-Omega Team – At one night, everyone was watching television. The Anchor of the TV news was talking about the episode that happened at the Multinational Space Station: “A few days ago, the radar of the Multinational Space Station recorded the presence of an UFO near our planet. Later another unknown ship also invaded our airspace leaving all countries on alert. The worldwide intelligence agencies are investigating the case.” “That episode occurred with the detection of our presence. We must avoid any situation that may expose us.” Sivoc declared. Zara spoke again about the episode in the park: “Commander, I’m still afraid about that day when Nicolas and I were walking in the Central Park and the gang attacked us. Don’t you think that the event will draw attention? Maybe someone saw what happened.” “Not even on our planet, with all the psychic evolution is easy to find someone who has the ability to use telekinesis. They say that only the commander Merko owns such power. It seems that his mind can emit electromagnetic waves capable of modifying the gravitational field around the objects and even to manipulate the energies contained in the molecules of the environment.” Sivoc affirmed. “What happened can put our mission at risk. In this case, you acted in self-defense. This power, maybe it was caused because of the implantation of the chip we performed in the boy. However, this situation is fantastic. You are right this can attract agents that capture aliens in this planet. Imagine if they put their hands in our ship, laser guns, sunglasses, transformation and teleportation watches... Logically, they will use reverse engineering to advance technologically.” *** But it was too late. The Alpha-Omega government team, specialized in extraterrestrial affairs, had moved to the center of space control. A couple of agents were in charge of the case, Collin Netil and Ann Soliver. They talked about the fact that was leaked to the entire press: “Agent Netil, some aspects surprise me in this case. Why two ships would appear in the space within a few days? Are they still here on Earth?” “We’ll request a report of all occurrences to the FBI and ask for information from the governments of other countries. Ann, I believe we have a great case of alien presence to investigate. Imagine if we can put our hands on these extraterrestrials equipment and capture some specimens to study?” The team members decided to make a report about what had happened. Besides studying the cases of extraterrestrial appearances on the planet, one of the major purposes of the organization was to capture the visitors, make biological researches on them and possibly analyze and assimilate their technologies with the intention of acquiring scientific and military knowledge. “Where are their ships? Are they already infiltrated among us? We need to map the entire planet and use all available radar systems to locate them. We have so many doubts about this case.” Agent Soliver said. As soon as they requested the police reports, which showed abnormal happenings, they received information about the incident in Central Park and the unusual way his tormentors hanged them on a tree. The men reported in testimony that a couple made them levitate as well as their weapons and escaped. When the Agent Collin Netil received the email, he immediately ordered: “Get the experts to make a total scan at the scene. We’ll record all the testimonies and make a throughout survey. Check if there were cameras in the area. Our chief will love this case.” When they reached the place, a team of the federal police investigators was already working on the case. Thompson, from the FBI, went to Agent Netil and to Agent Soliver and said: “Who are you and how did you enter into a restricted area of investigation?” Collin showed his badge: NETIL, COLLIN FEDERAL AGENT – LEVEL 1 ALPHA OMEGA TEAM – PENTAGON “Never heard of such agents in our government! I’ll call the Federal Bureau of investigation. Wait a minute, please.” Immediately he called and confirmed that this organization was directly tied to the General Staff of the National Security Forces, of course he allowed their presence onto their investigations. The agents finished the report and took it to the chief who was anxiously waiting for some relevant information. He was an old man, about 67 years old, with a mustache and gray hair, calm and with a rough voice. He was already retired, but still worked and was passionate about such issues. Because of his experience, the government allowed him to continue accompanying this type of case. It was a strategic advantage. His name was Ronald Steighen. He was intimately familiar with issues related to his agency, he had already captured and studied several alien specimens and to work there was his greatest pleasure. “Sir, here is the report with our primary conclusions about the case.” Collin said. “This ET wants to become a warrior of justice to confront criminals. If we’re lucky, he’ll appear again. And his will to do justice will be its Achilles’ heel, the weakness which will make us catch him.” Ann pronounced. Ronald looked at the report and analyzed each sentence: “This is not a specimen easy to be caught. It is well trained and knows how to use his weapons. He raised his victims into the air with ease. Create a profile of our ET. Let’s wait for his movements and identify him; we need to study his area of expertise, physical space, modus operandi, relationships and weaknesses. We know that they can turn into human beings like us. I already found one of them more than twenty years ago. He had this power to move objects. Is he back?” “Chief, I’d like you to tell us this story. It may be relevant in this case.” “I’ll tell it at another time. He nearly destroyed an entire military base and even managed to escape. I don’t like to talk about it. You’ll have to use intelligence and surprise factor. They are made of flesh and blood. We’ve already managed to capture and take some of them to the military base in Arizona. In another occasion I’ll tell all the details, but now we don’t have time. We need to capture them. I want a report about the investigations.” “Chief, there were no cameras in the crime scene. We only have testimonies of people who saw the action and they are defending the alien.” Colin reported. Make a sketch and place it in all the police stations as national security priority. Surely we’ll catch him.” Ronald spoke, punching the table. “Agent Soliver, scan the blocks near the place and put undercover agents at strategic points. I want to know every detail related to this case, did you hear? Anything! One more thing: Use these special infrared glasses, because when they are transmuted into terrestrial form, they emit radiation that can be perceived with the use of these optical devices.” *** The building of the newspaper “The Los Angeles’ Voice was located only two blocks ahead from where the Alfa-Omega was based. The chief editor, Albert Dither, was walking from one side to the other, waiting for his best journalist to return from the reporting about the case of the gang in New York, who had been levitated in a tree by an unknown couple. “Would he be a Special Forces soldier, who coincidentally was in that place?” His thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of reporter Andrew Thomas. “Sir, I got some information about the case. It’s not much more than what was published in the newspapers. It seems that they used a special kind of antigravity technology.” “Look for this kid and the woman who was with him. Come on, I need more information about this event. I see a great headline!” Dither said. “Chief, you must be joking. If we announce the presence of aliens, the credibility of our newspaper will drop to zero.” “But if we get the evidences, the effect can be better than expected. Have you ever thought of the possibility that we can prove the alien presence here on Earth?” “Yes, sir. Now I understand why you managed to become the chief. To go after unprecedented and fantastic news has always been your ideal. I’ll look for evidences with my team. Soon I’ll return with the results.”",

      "content": "– X. The Sky and the Stars – When they discovered the location of the Science II, Merko and his team teleported themselves to their ship in Alaska and go directly to the deep of the oceans. During the trip the commander Merko sat in a chair on the ship and began to remember his last mission on Earth, exactly twenty-three years ago on the Earth calendar. He came to the planet with his friend Silion to test the space folds and the possibility of time travel. They were flying over Canada and the United States, before landing on the secret base in Alaska. During this flight, they were intercepted by the U.S. Air Force, which captured his friend in order to make experiments and study. That memory made him sad. He could still hear in his mind, repeatedly, a conversation with his friend shortly before the incident. “Merko, when we return to our planet I intend to live in peace with my wife and my two sons. This life keeps me away from the people I love most. It’s time to stop.” “I can’t believe you’re willing to retire, Silion.” Merko replied smiling. He felt his heart aching, and tears came to his eyes. The memories made him miss his friend from the bottom of his heart. There was a self-destruct mechanism created by the scientists of the planet Vida. All the time travelers were equipped with a heart and brain paralyzing substance, activated by electrical and hormonal waves of thought. In a situation of imminent threat they needed to focus their thoughts in death for three minutes and it would occur. Everyone who traveled to the past, especially to the planet Earth, received an implant with a chip that released this substance, so, when captured they weren’t used in experiments or delivered their military, technological or scientific knowledge. The discovery of such knowledge could provide harmful consequences for human beings, altering the story by changing the Earth’s past. *** Every night, Nicolas loved to walk with Zara around the streets of New York, such as the 5th and Madison Avenue. They walked arm in arm, like an ordinary couple. She hadn’t mentioned anything about with him on Earth again, and he preferred to let everything happen naturally, although, sometimes he felt anxious for her decision. On a Friday night, they stopped and sat on a bench to talk. Zara looked at the stars and said: “Nicolas, do you like to look at the stars?” “I like it, but when we went up with the ship, I could see the Earth from above and this was one of the most beautiful things I had seen. It’s all so magnificent and I thought how small we are.” He said, very close to her. He was so happy around her and talking about something he loved. “And to think that although the Milky Way has thousands of stars, planet Earth is placed in a solar system, located right in the “Arm of Orion”. The Sun is a star considered of fifth magnitude. The Alnilam star is six times greater than the Sun. The Antares star is three hundred and eight times larger than the Sun, and the Betelgeuse star is five hundred ninety-one times larger than the Earth’s Sun.” Zara said, with her face looking up. Her eyes were shining. “Do you have astronauts?” “The word ‘astronaut’ means traveler of the stars, but the moon is the farthest place to which man traveled in your time, so far. All of us, on our planet, are trained since youth in the astronomical sciences, because space and time travels are needed.” “And what about the black holes, do you have knowledge of them?” Nicolas asked, hugging her. “In the midst of our galaxies, and many others, there is probably a black hole, with approximately four million solar masses. That is what keeps the galaxy uniform. We aren’t sucked into them because of the rotation of the galaxy, as we are not sucked into the sun, because the translation of the Earth. The rotation of the solar system around the core of the Milky Way has a period of two hundred million years. It is believed that the black hole is a very dense body mass with large gravitational energy, and that not even light is able to escape it. That’s why he is black, because it has no light. It’s sucked to its gravity.” They remained silence for some time, watching the sky, feeling the sensation that the beautiful night was offering. The wind blew gently on their faces. “That’s how galaxies and planets work. Everyone needs to be on the move to keep their orbits and avoid being sucked by their suns, black holes and translational centers.” The doctor explained. “This galaxy, the Milky Way, performs rotational movements around itself, bringing the small galaxies into its orbit, while it rotates around its own core.” “This knowledge about outer space makes it so beautiful, that is easy to feel humble looking at it. A thousand years ago, the human being would find it impossible to use computers, cell phones, aircrafts, submarines and many other appliances and machines, which are routine in the present time. So when you get to planet Vida, you’ll see how we have are evolved. But for you, Nicolas, who studies physics, everything will be wonderful, especially our relationship with the environment and the new forms of energy.” They continued to look at the stars in the sky and tears flowed from Zara’s eyes. She missed her family and her home, which was so distant in her galaxy. Nicolas promptly wiped her tears with a handkerchief and asked her: “What is it, dear? What makes you cry?” “I’m remembering of my loved ones, in my planet.” Answered her, willing to disguise how much she missed them. This made Nicolas thought how painful would it be for her to have to move away from her world to live her life beside him. Trying not to be sad by her memories, she continued to talk about the stars: “Here in the northern hemisphere sky, we can clearly see my galaxy, M31, in the Andromeda constellation. You can also see the Ursa Major constellation, with seven major stars, that one with a square and a tail to the left side. Watch it.” She said looking up with attention, snuggling in the arms of Nicolas. She could feel the heart of her beloved pounding and knew that, deep inside, one day they could be happy, if it wasn’t for the difference between their worlds. “How beautiful is the immensity of the sky, especially on a night like this.” Added the boy. “That’s the constellation Ursa Minor, with a square, a tail facing up, and the star Polaris in the top, indicating north. But, in the southern hemisphere, there are also very beautiful stars.” “We could synchronize our watches and go to some country of the South America and to enjoy the night.” He suggested. His young and wild spirit together with the curiosity of knowing his own world better, really appreciated everything together with Zara. She was thinking about the dangers of moving away from the rest of the group, but thought about the moment she was living and soon agreed. “And where will we go?” She asked. “Let’s go to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Corcovado, where the Christ the Redeemer is. The view from there is amazing. They say that the landscapes of mountains mingle with the beauty of the sea creating an ecological paradise.” They synchronized their watches to the correct latitude and longitude and, in an instant, they were in the desired location. They materialized at the top of the stairs of the Christ the Redeemer, contemplating the beautiful landscape of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It didn’t take too long and they were already fixing their eyes in the southern sky. A couple who was kissing and drinking something sitting at the restaurant table, on that place during the evening, saw them appear out of nowhere, and the woman said: “Did you see what I saw? That couple came out of nowhere.” “Are they spirits or real people? Is there something wrong with our drinks?” Asked the man throwing away the beer that was in his glass. “We’d better get out of here.” Said the woman. Zara ignored the couple because she heard them say they would leave. Besides, she didn’t intend to stay there for too long. Then she began to describe the constellations of the heavens of the South American continent: “That constellation of four star in the shape of a cross is the Crux. There’s a fifth star called Intrometida, which means Intrusive in Portuguese.” “The names of the stars are Acrux, Gacrux, Mimosa, Pálida and Intrometida, which is the smaller one. The biggest part of the cross points to south and was widely used by mariners in the past.” “That’s why the Crux is part of the flags of several countries in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia, Brazil, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.” Nick commented. “Up above, we see the Three Mary’s, which are those stars aligned. They are part of Orion’s belt. The names of the stars are Mintaka, Alnilam and Alnitaka. They have a very strong light. To the North of the Three Mary’s, you can see the Betelgeuse star, and to the south, the Sirius star.” “Yeah, you know the sky of our planet very well!” He said, surprised. “It couldn’t be different, because for a traveler, to know the ways is an obligation.” Zara replied. “Besides, astronomy is a required subject in our schools.” Nicolas, in fact, was really enjoying everything he heard, while he stood staring at Zara’s blue eyes... That was the heaven he most admired. Then, slowly he began to approach his lips and kissed her deeply, at that moment, he forgot everything. He again felt the scent of jasmine that pleased him so much, and he finally decided to ask: “Zara, why do you always smell like jasmine?” “In the future, I researched a lot about you and I knew that your favorite scent was jasmine. So, I decided to use it to please you, which has always my biggest purpose.” Nicolas returned his lips toward hers. Then she put her finger on Nicolas’ lips and said: “We have to get out of here and return to New York. Our friends will be worried if we lose the contact. Let’s go, please, Nick.” Although he was happy in the company of Zara and observing the celestial firmament he admired so much, he knew it was necessary to go back. Always thinking about his mother Loraine and his beloved sister Sophia, he imagined how would they be, but he was oriented by Sivoc not to get in touch with anyone. At least for now, he couldn’t leave clues for Merko’s team. Besides, they also promised to bring Nicolas back to nearest time of his encounter with Zara in the past, when they returned from the Planet Vida. In other words, when he returned his disappearance wouldn’t be noticed by anyone. So, they synchronized their watches to return to New York. They met their friends in the apartment, where they gathered, customarily, to talk about the latest events in safety. Some drinks and food couldn’t be found on the planet Vida, which had a restricted diet of pre-made food and lots of pills. There wasn’t the same flavor provided by our foods. So, Nicolas ordered a delicious pizza, which would be accompanied by a special wine. An explosion of flavor that all aliens began to love. With each passing day, the boy introduced to his new friends all the diverse cuisine that was in the city where they were hidden. The aliens were pleased with the food and dishes of all kinds, with the gastronomy from nearly every country in the world. Those were unparalleled flavors that their palates weren’t accustomed to feel. In addition, tours to cinemas, theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainments made their visit to our planet very pleasant. This pleasure was completely new. They only knew the history of their ancestors. *** On a Sunday, Nicolas invited his friends to go to a huge amusement park that was in the city. The rollercoaster was kilometric. The boy challenged them to the adventure and everyone looked at each other nervous. Tibor said: “This is easy for me. I’ll buy five tickets.” So he ran to the box office. Zara was afraid, but decided to let the adrenaline rush. They all went to the rollercoaster and returned disheveled and agitated. Nicolas invited Zara to ride a Ferris wheel and when they were up there, he showed the beauty of the city to her, what ended up creating a romantic mood. When they stopped, they kissed with passion. It was amazing to notice the adrenaline of his lover, and also introducing her the good things of his world. He felt complete beside her and wished immensely that such moment didn’t come to an end. *** On another occasion, Nicolas took Zara to watch a movie that she enjoyed a lot. It was a novel and the meeting was very nice, with popcorn and soda, while they played and talked about nothing important. When he discovered that she liked the cinema and that her favorite movies were the romances, the boy decided he would take her to enjoy that kind of entertainment whenever possible. He knew he was somehow part of her life and that the pleasure they shared was genuine and unconditional. *** Nicolas also wanted to introduce the other beauties of our planet to Zara. “Zara, the people from your planet seem a little tense. They’re always talking about environmental destruction and degradation of the hydro resources of the Earth. Here on my planet there are many wonderful things to be done and seen. From the past to the present, humans were born, genius or not, and fought hard to turn people into what we are today. Freedom of opinion, the end of prejudice in all its forms, the search for the cure of many diseases that killed thousands of people were some of the reasons for these humans to fight so much. Revolutions in thought with great men and women who had stood out in history resulted in the achievement of equality rights and freedom of their nations. Even today, there are still fights in countries because of democracy and the basic rights of the human society. We still have many problems to solve, but there are wonderful people willing to do their part to improve our systems.” He paused for a moment, kissing her lightly on the lips and continued. “I would like to enjoy these moments we have together and take you to see other places. Then, he held Zara’s hand. They both pressed their watches and their first was at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The night was falling and the lights began to be turned on. She was dazzled by the sight and said: “What a beautiful thing, Nicolas. I didn’t know you were so romantic.” “Here in Paris we are behind the time of New York. We’ll have dinner at a restaurant on top of the tower. The view is unbelievable.” After a tasty dinner, the boy decided to make another surprise for his lover. “Honey, close your eyes, I’ll take you to another wonderful place.” So they went to the Taj Mahal Palace, one of the most popular monuments of India. The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum located in Agra, considered one of the Seven Wonders of the modern world. With their walls full of with semi-precious stones, the dome has gold strands, which impress the visitors. They say it was built to house the body of the wife of a powerful sultan of the country in which it is located. “Nicolas, it looks a bit like the Palace of the King Zador II, on my planet. It’s beautiful and magnificent, and the clothing of the people are very different from those used in other countries.” Said the doctor. “Here on Earth there are different traditions. So many races and cultures are a great opportunity for the human being to live with differences and develop their spirituality. That’s what makes our world so special.” After that, they returned to U.S.A. to meet the other members of the team. Sivoc observed with attention that Nicolas and Zara wanted to be together all the time and there was nothing more to do to prevent the relationship of the two of them. He knew there were reports in his planet about other encounters between humans of different ages and the result was unpredictable. He imagined that it was actually possible to have hybrid terrestrial beings living among children of humans and extraterrestrial beings of the future. Although they transmuted themselves to accomplish their missions, their new bodies provided a loving approximation for the people from Earth. “When love dominates the mind and heart, anything is possible. Humans will always fall in love, because this is the formula for the perpetuation of the human race.” Reflected the commander. He remembered his wife Laiza and his kids. He thought about how hard it was to conquer her because, at the time, her family didn’t allow their marriage. Since he was a traveler scientist, her parents knew she would only be able to stay with her family while her husband was on a mission. That wasn’t what they wanted to Laiza. However, now she was his great love and everything he did was for the sake of his family. Therefore, he didn’t know if he had the right to interfere in the love that was born between Zara and Nicolas.",

      "content": "– XI. The Other Mission of Merko – While Merko rested in his ship, he began to remember his previous mission with his friend Silion. At that time, they came to test the effects of magnetic and gravitational fields over the people from planet Vida. Besides, they were also experiencing the accuracy of time-space travel. When they were on the American desert in New Mexico, they were attacked by the North American Air Force. “Enable the anti-radars shield of the ship, Silion.” Merko ordered. “Barrier enabled. Commander, a red light on the control panel is showing a failure in the shell.” Silion said. “Quick, turn on the force field.” Merko warned. “Let’s get out of here fast and try to get to the Exosphere, put the ship at full speed.” Before they could escape, two F-16 fighters were prepared for the attack, and one of them managed to hit the ship. In the moments that proceeded the fall of ship in the American desert, Merko teleported himself away from the place. He tried to take Silion with him, but his friend was seriously injured, so he couldn’t save him, although he had done his best. The Americans took the ship and a wounded Silion to an Army base in Arizona. There, they began to make experiences. His friend, even wounded, managed to communicate telepathically and was about to kill himself when Merko asked for a chance to try to save him. The men of the Alpha-Omega secret team arrived in their white overalls and injected a substance into the bloodstream of Silion. They removed samples of his skin, bone marrow and one rare strain of hair. All of this was sent to the lab. “This is weird, their blood is red, just like ours!” said Ronald, the chief of staff that accompanied everything from a control room. The same man who would command, in the future, the investigation about Nicolas and Zara. “Let’s decipher the mysteries of these extraterrestrial beings and, who knows, maybe later they may reveal their technology. The department wants to know how they manage to travel through universe.” “We need to know their technologies. They must own very powerful weapons that will be able to subdue our enemies. So we’ll be several steps ahead of the other governments of the Earth.” Spoke Keith, one of the scientists from Alpha-Omega group, who was standing next to Ronald. “Be very careful with our specimen. I want four men on guard, 24 hours a day, taking turns.” Said the chief. “But, sir, we are in the Base 51 of U.S. Army. It is the most secure place on the planet! It was designed to protect the president and his family even against attacks with nuclear bombs. There’s no risk with the alien here inside, we don’t need to take extra measures of protection.” Keith said. “Never underestimate the enemy. That’s how we lose battles and even wars.” agent Ronald replied. “As soon as the medication kicks in, let’s start the interrogation. Take care of the injuries and try to recover his consciousness.” Ordered one of the team’s doctors. Silion, still hostage, pondered how those people were ignorant. “If the primates had red blood, like Australopithecus, why would my blood be different? Instead of trying an approximation, they just want my people’s technology and our weapons to subjugate other nations. How underdeveloped they are! I must do something to set me free.” He thought at last. “Please, Silion don’t give up now! I believe I found a way to get there.” Merko communicated telepathically with his close friend. “My friend, we were instructed to end up our own lives in case of being captured. We know that our contacts can cause fatal consequences for the evolution of the human race.” Silion replied. “Please hold on a little longer, I need only one more day. Please give me a chance to execute my plan.” Merko always sought a solution to the unexpected problems and used to accomplish his missions, no matter how difficult they were. So, he teleported himself, touching the blue watch he had on his wrist, to reach the base 51, put on his glasses, turned himself up and watched the movement of everyone who entered there. “How’s the situation in there?” He asked anxiously, telepathically. “There are many men in white clothes, preparing to examine me. However, they seem to be waiting for someone.” Silion said. In fact, the agents were waiting for someone, agent Ronald and agent Keith, who were preparing them for the interrogation. Although the Alpha-Omega staff belonged to the government, they had to work secretly; in the case of peaceful contact with extraterrestrials from other nations the government wouldn’t be politically harmed. The capture and incarceration mission was executed by the military, which had well prepared basis and good logistics, while team members of the Alpha-Omega group, who were subordinated to the Pentagon, performed the part of researches, communication and intelligence. So, Merko saw a major, who had entered the place with an army vehicle and, for fifteen minutes, remained in the background. When he came out, he started to follow him. He kept teleported himself to the places where the soldier was heading, and was planning to take his place. Quietly, he arrived at the soldier’s house. Still in the garden of the residence, he approached the man with a laser gun he was carrying. The major passed out, and Merko scraped some cells from the inner portion of his cheeks and sent his genetic information to a chip adapted to their glasses of genetic transmutation. Immediately, he became a perfect copy of the major and decided to disintegrate him with his laser gun, so there wouldn’t be any evidence of his death. Someone in the window called him suddenly, and he could see it was a beautiful woman. “Hi, John. I thought you wouldn’t leave that damned base. The government is crazy to build these places underground. Besides, if some catastrophe happens they are the only ones who’ll be saved. And what they will do in an empty world? Come on, please, I made a delicious dinner.” Merko walked around the room admiring the neat place, with a roaring fireplace in the background. The place seemed comfortable with dim lights and candles. “It’s a very nice place”, he thought. There were pictures of the major with Lorena, his wife. She had curly golden hair, smooth white skin like peach and a beauty worthy of a goddess. “Come on, baby, take a hot bath. Everything is already prepared upstairs, but hurry, because the dinner is ready and I found that red wine that you love in the cellar.” Lorena said. Merko, without saying a word, went upstairs as a servant and took his hot bath. He quickly returned and soon realized that the sound he emitted was the perfect voice of the major. He thought how much the genetic engineering and nanotechnology worked well. “Let’s have dinner, honey. Today you’re so quiet. Did anything happen?” She asked. “No, I’m just tired.” He answered. “Wait until after dinner that I will give you that massage you love.” Said the beautiful woman. He then experienced the taste of that delicious wine with a delicious dinner and soon began to yawn, showing fatigue. They went up to the bedroom, and Lorena began to kiss him, and they made love, making Merko forget his friend and everything around him. When they woke up, he put on the uniform of the soldier and was on his way to the base, only thinking about saving his friend. “Where have you been, Merko? For a moment I thought you had left. I’m in trouble, and it seems that experience is imminent. The movement here is big.” Silion said telepathically. “Wait, I’m coming.” Promptly, Merko replied. With the insignia of the soldier, he entered the camp and he had to calibrate the coordinates of teleportation to get to his friend and then escape. He knew his laser gun was very powerful, but he also knew it would be difficult to fight with all the soldiers, so he needed a good strategy. Already infiltrated on the base, he decided to take one of the men in white that would examine Silion. He immobilized and took him to a room. He disintegrated him along with the clothes of the major and continued walking, now transfigured in that new figure, following his purpose. He knew he could become any person and still could, if necessary use a power that few in his planet possessed or knew how to use, the telekinesis, the ability to move objects with psychic force. This ability always made him weak and he would only use it in extreme situations. He approached a room covered by glass on all sides. He could see four men around a table where a being was laid. He soon realized that he was in the right place. They were about to inject a substance into Silion’s arm, when Merko teleported himself into the room and, with four blows in fatal regions, he shoot down all opponents. “How do you feel?” He asked to Silion. “Very weak and wounded. I think you’d better go alone.” Meanwhile, in a room nearby, a general and his staff were following the procedure. The agents Ronald and Keith were preparing the equipment for the experiments with the specimen but at that moment were in another room next to the general. “General, there’s something wrong. A man is freeing our specimen and appears to be running.” Said the captain of the operation. “Ring the alarm. It looks like we’ve got luck. Probably we’ll catch two fish with one bait.” Said the general with a smile. A large operation soldiers invaded the research room. All escape routes were closed. Merko placed Silion over his shoulders when he said: “My friend, my life cycle is almost over. Please save your life. Use the laser on me and teleport yourself to the ship. They didn’t manage to get any information from me, you arrived just in time. They took my transmutation recognition infrared glasses, but it won’t make any difference if you escape. Go to Challenge I fast. It’s already programmed to take you back. At this point, the ship was already ready; it was repaired by self-healing robots.” With tearful eyes, Merko disintegrated his friend. When he was preparing himself to press the button of his watch, he noticed that there was someone behind him, ready to attack. It was a Ranger Sergeant. And then two more soldiers appeared. Merko decided to face them because he wanted to avenge the death of his best friend. “Where is your friend? Did he escape or is hiding?” The sergeant asked with irony. Soon they realized that the aliens had the ability to turn into humans. While Merko prepared himself for the attack, someone hit him from behind and he got a bit stunned. But the struggle was just the beginning. With his great skill, he struck deadly blows at everyone, one after another. Suddenly, there came many others and he had to use the telekinesis, moving all the objects of the place against its rivals, including pointing their weapons to each other. They all stood still for a moment with the guns in the air, pointing at them. When the general arrived at the main entrance, holding a grenade, he said: “You’d better surrender, or I’ll throw this grenade and kill us all.” “This is for my friend Silion, who you have imprisoned and murdered.” Merko replied. With the power of his mind, he removed the lock pin of the grenade. The general looked terrified and said: “You’re totally crazy! We’ll all die together.” In the experiences room of the Army Base, everything was blown. Only the agents Ronald and Keith managed to escape unharmed from the explosion, because they were on the command room, which was isolated and protected by armored walls. From their refuge, they observed the damage that the alien had made in the military base. They observed everything being destroyed, his friends losing their lives, and they couldn’t do anything at that time besides watching, submissive, to all the destruction caused by the alien. Immediately after removing the pin from the grenade, and even before the big explosion that destroyed part of the military complex, Merko pressed the button of his watch and reached his ship. He knew that, unlike the military, he wasn’t bound to that room and wasn’t taking any risk with the grenade. Now his friend was avenged. He prepared himself to return to space. He checked all the controls of the ship and went up with an unbelievable speed. He left behind his great friend Silion and the beautiful Lorena, who briefly was the best thing that happened in his whole life. While he reflected on the mission, though about how Silion was always ready to protect him and willing to go anywhere with his friend. Several times he had saved his life and he wasn’t able to repay. His eyes watered with sadness. He also couldn’t stop thinking about the beautiful Lorena. He didn’t understand how he been able to feel attraction for a woman from the past. However, she was so lovely and beautiful that he couldn’t stop thinking about her. If he could go back in time, maybe he wouldn’t have gone away and would take the major’s place. On his planet he could never be happy with anyone and, deep in his heart, he felt that he could be happy with Lorena. Living as an impostor, however, wasn’t a pleasant idea to him, even though that woman was capable of messing with his heart, hardened by failed relationships. The commander has programmed his ship to enter the space-time bridge with warp speed and ordered to Z8, the central computer of the ship: “Z8, take the ship home safely. I want to rest a bit. Just call me in case of an emergency.” “Yes, commander.” Z8 replied. *** While the Challenge I was heading for the planet Vida, under the command of Z8, Merko could rest. But his mind couldn’t relax, and he was plagued by several memories of moments spent beside Silion. One adventure that went back and forth had happened five years ago. A giant meteor was on a collision course with the planet Vida. All the alternatives to intercept and destroy it had been discarded by the Royal Council. There was only one chance to deflect the asteroid: Using a powerful laser beam that could bombard and destroy it from the planet Vida while it was still thousands of miles away from the fatal encounter. The Challenge II ship, which was coupled to a laser gun, however, was defective, and engineers worked tirelessly to fix it. There was no time to solve the problem of repairing the ship, and the gun couldn’t be removed or transported to another vehicle in a time. As they were all condemned to death with the imminent destruction of the planet, Merko fierce entered his ship Challenge I and decided to leave in order to project himself against the meteor. He would try to use the own Challenge I, heading toward the celestial body, being tangential to one of its ends in order to get it out of his route. His computer, Z8, had calculated the exact time and point of impact in which they would get the highest percentage of success in the mission of saving the planet Vida. The commander didn’t say goodbye to anyone, knowing that many would try to stop him from continuing with his suicide mission. He entered his ship and departed at an extraordinary speed toward the asteroid, which was still at a safe distance to change its course. Silion watched his friend in his last moments. He knew Merko very well and knew that something strange was about to happen. Before he left, they talked: “Merko, why haven’t you talked to anyone lately? What’s on your mind, my friend?” “I’m worried about the arrival of Meteor X26. I believe it will be impossible to stop it and we’ll all die. I must think of a way out.” “Our engineers will be able to recover the Challenge II on time. The weapons are ready and only the reactor still needs to be repaired.” “Dear Silion, when they repair the ship it will be too late. There’s no time left, X26 is close to a point where we won’t be able to stop it. We both know that very well! We don’t need to fool ourselves with false hopes. There’s no time to wait for the Challenge II to be repaired.” Silion lowered his head, feeling sad, and let Merko alone. He knew that in difficult situations, the commander used to make wise decisions and that he would find a way out. A few hours later, he looked for him again and found out that his ship was gone. Silion had a bad feeling and imagined that the captain had left for death. At an incredible speed, Merko had programmed his ship to a course against the large asteroid. The commander was traveling with tears in his eyes, thinking about everything he had left behind. At the same time, he hoped that the impact was enough to save the planet and all its inhabitants. Silion quickly went to meet the engineers that recovered the ship’s reactors. He asked for urgency in the repair and accelerated all the steps of the maintenance process. Merko could already see the monster X26, that seemed voracious on it purpose. Silently, he said goodbye to his life. When the ship approached, a few miles away, he heard a voice shouting in a holograph that appeared in front of him: “My friend Merko, open the way, because I’ll use the laser in this meteor!” He only had time to observe the powerful red ray passing near his ship and hit X26 with surgical precision. The asteroid passed close to Merko’s ship, and he felt the effect of its passage. The meteor moved away from the planet Vida and everyone was saved, including the commander who had been so close to surrender his life for his planet. “You’re crazy, Merko. You would sacrifice yourself for humanity. I’d really miss you, my friend. “Thanks again, Silion. You always appear when I need the most. I was really willing to give my life for the continuation of the human race, but I confess I’m happy to continue living. Let’s go home to celebrate my return. *** After losing his close friend, Silion, Merko remembered returning to planet Vida, the moment his life was saved. In memory of Silion, because he knew that would be his friend’s will, he decided to continue his current mission, doing what he liked. He loved the space travels. To contemplate the big bright stars, planets and their satellites was his greatest pleasure. Those visions were what most impressed Merko. When he had to execute some mission and let the adrenaline circulate through his veins, that was what really made him happy. He wished one day he could find a woman with an adventurous spirit that would complete his life, but had no hopes. He had already tried before and failed. He couldn’t forget that woman from the past. There was something different about her that messed with the captain. But he didn’t knew that a woman like Lorena was a treasure that is not easily found, nor on Earth, neither in the planet Vida. *** On Earth, Lorena couldn’t understand what had happened to the army major, John, her husband, who disappeared suddenly. After a useless wait, she decided to move from the state. She left Arizona, where her husband worked, and moved to Los Angeles to raise her child. She didn’t understand what had happened to John after that unforgettable night they spent together. The next morning, he left to work with his usual mysterious behavior. She had no idea what exactly he was doing in that military base, from where he never returned. The army had no concrete news and just informed that her husband was missing. She began to be supported by the government, but she really missed the man she had lost. She was also sorry because she hadn’t been able to make a funeral and give a decent goodbye to the man she had loved, the father of her only child. She was very sad, but continued to raise her son, Nicolas. With great difficulty she managed to educate him and now she paid the University where he studied. Some years later, Sophia was born, which was a blessing and she also struggled to give her a good education. She was very proud of her kids, because they both were excellent students, didn’t get involved with bad companies and had clear purposes to succeed in life: Nicolas wanted to become a great physics, and Sophia dreamed of being an environmental engineer. Despite how much she missed her husband, Lorena had managed to overcome her fears. She raised her kids very well, who were growing up healthy and with good characters. But she still missed a great love in her life.",

      "content": "– XII. Lorena’s Sadness – Twelve years after the disappearance of the major, Lorena met a gentleman who charmed her in a birthday party of one of Nicolas’ friends from school. His name was Robert. Since she had already spent many years alone, she decided to give herself a chance and try another relationship. She was excited at the prospect of loving and being loved again. Mr. Robert was a good man. He was a civil engineer, who was always involved in large projects and, as Lorena, was also a widower. He had beautiful green eyes and dark brown hair, wore a mustache, which was already slightly grizzled, and was extremely charming. When he saw Lorena, he immediately became fascinated with her golden hair and her beauty. He asked her out and she accepted, because besides being elegant, he was also an educated and interesting man. Robert fell in love and did everything to get Lorena, who also surrendered herself to her new love. They both tried to be happy again. After two years, Lorena gave birth to a daughter called Sophia, who became her great friend; when she was not at school, she wanted to go with her mother everywhere. Robert also loved his daughter and did everything to please her. He helped her raising Nicolas, advising him and acting like he was his real father. Together they formed a happy family. However, Robert died shortly after Sophia’s birth, because of a massive heart attack, which occurred during one of his trips. He worked very hard and was always stressed, although he was almost retiring. That was another pain for the young woman to carry in her life marked by irreparable losses. Thus, Lorena became a widow of two husbands. Robert was a great companion, although she hadn’t felt for him the overwhelming love she felt for the major who had disappeared so many years ago. Now, besides the pain of losing two men, her son had also disappeared. She loved the boy and was completely lost without him. That was what happened with the major; he simply disappeared and was considered dead. She knew she couldn’t resist the same pain again. At least she had been able to provide a funeral to Robert, saying goodbye and whenever she missed him she could go to her husband’s grave to pray. She needed at least to find the body of her son. She didn’t lose the hope of finding him alive, but she knew the chances were few, because Nick had always been a very responsible kid and would have already gotten in touch if he could do it. Lorena did everything she could to try to find her son. She placed advertisements in all the newspapers, informed the FBI about his disappearance and went to the University to seek for clues and understand why her son, who was so dedicated haven’t shown up for a few weeks. She and Sophia were alone, but Lorena found strength to continue to live and to look for her son. After several months, she finally received a mysterious email from Nicolas. “Mother, I love you. Don’t worry, I’m fine. But I can’t go back now; I’m involved with a problem related to a friend. Please, don’t tell anyone that you spoke to me. Keep pretending I’m missing. For our sake and little Sophia’s. Soon, everything will be solved. Kisses from your son who loves you more than anything, Nicolas.” *** Nicolas always knew he shouldn’t get in touch with his mother. From the beginning, however, he tried to think of alternatives to calm Lorena down. After talking a lot with Drako, who was an expert in Information Systems, the two of them managed to create a way to send an untraceable email, so that Merko couldn’t use the message to get to him. They still needed a few weeks and many meetings to convince Sivoc that it would be safe to send the email. As soon as it was possible, Nicolas managed to send a message to his mother. *** After seeing that e-mail, Lorena felt a mix of sensations. On one hand, she was relieved to know that her son was alive, but then she was worried about losing him. She decided to wait, because there was nothing else to do about Nicolas. She had to trust her son, who always knew how to be responsible. At school, he was a model student with good grades and never brought trouble home. He always made his mother proud with his virtues, morals and common sense. Certainly, something very strange was happening. And although she trusted her son, Lorena couldn’t remove all the anguish of her heart, after all, she was pretty worried.",

      "title": "– XIII. The Confrontation –",
      "content": "– XIII. The Confrontation – Merko, Crom and the others from his team reached the position of the ship on the bottom of the sea, in the Gulf of Mexico. They positioned the Challenge I beside it and entered the Science II teleporting themselves, but nobody was there. With a paralyzing gun, they left the robot dog, Little Wolf, out of action. Only his eyes were moving from side to side watching the movements of the invaders. That was when Merko said: “Crom, check in the central computer the last location they were transported from the ship. There must be some record of their position.” So, they managed to know what would be the next step: to follow the coordinates of the teleportation position registered in the ship. However, Drako had placed false records of latitude and longitude on the computers boards in order to distract them. Merko and his team didn’t anticipate the intelligence of the Information System’s expert and headed to the places indicated in the ship’s computer, moving away from the ones they were pursuing. The trick used by Drako was a way for Sivoc’s team to gain some time and hide while waiting for the opening day of the wormhole near Calisto moon, where intergalactic positions would become perfect for the trip back. Merko and his soldiers looked around and realized they were in the Red Square, the tourist site most famous and visited of Russia. The big streets of Moscow starting on this square and were heading to several places. They observed many tourists who admired the beauties of the place. The tour guides showed all the buildings around, which were historically important. Merko and the others put the infrared glasses to find signs of transmuted people, but couldn’t see them. They walked through the crowd with their sunglasses and didn’t detect the presence of their targets. “Mr. Commander, I can’t understand why they would come to this place so far from home and from the boys country. I observed in other records of the ship, and the places don’t make sense. Istanbul in Turkey, Tokyo in Japan...” “You don’t need to continue. Drako had duped us. He’s very smart and I didn’t think that this hunt would be easy. Let’s go back to our ship and think of some strategy. We need a better plan to find them.” *** Without achieving success in finding them, Merko again decided to contact Mirov, the organizer and advisor of his mission. “Counselor, I’d like to know if you got any other information about the target. We’re very close to it, but your help would be of great value at this time.” “Merko, give me a few hours to try to gather as much information as possible. I’ll contact you as soon as possible.” “I’m waiting for new information, counselor.” After some hours, Mirov returned the contact with good news. “Radof only got some information in the Royal Palace. They are in the country where the earthling lives, but that was the only thing I could discover. Certainly they’re hidden.” “Understood, Mr. Counselor. I’ll use this information the best way I can. We’ll find the earthling soon and we’ll succeed in our mission.” With this, they realized how difficult it would be to find them. They wouldn’t reveal themselves so easily and were certainly taking all the necessary precautions to remain hidden. Merko decided to trace a research strategy to track them. *** For the luck of Sivoc’s crew, they were all hidden. Sivoc, Drako and Zara rested in the apartment while Nicolas and Tibor trained in the martial arts academy. Sivoc was quiet, listening to classical music, which came from the radio and felt like it was penetrating deep into his soul making him relax. It was a symphony of Beethoven. “Simply a magnificent work of art!” He thought. The apartment in which he and his crew lived was large, with three bedrooms. The living room had the walls painted in the color of sand, with a comfortable sofa and a recliner. In his bedroom, there was a large window with a wonderful view of the city, where they spend a lot of time watching the frantic “coming and going” of the people. Living there, waiting for the days to go by, he never imagined that his rival Merko was searching at all the databases for any information, no matter how small, to look for the place where they were hidden. Crom, using regular tools of search, found some news about the episode that occurred in New York with the gang who levitated and remained suspended in a tree. The strange event caught the attention of the sensationalist media and was reported in all major newspapers online. Noticing that this was important evidence, he ran to his commandant and questioned him: “Mr. Merko, I think I found some important information about our target. Look at this fact in the city of New York.” “Brilliant, Captain Crom. A couple that imprisoned bandits by levitating them. It sounds like telekinesis. But how is it possible? The members of Science II don’t have this power. However, this fact is obviously related to them. Hurry, prepare all men. We’ll teleport ourselves there. I’m sure we’ll find more clues about Sivoc and his crew.” *** Merko and his team were in New York to try to find Nicolas. As the episode found in the newspapers had happened in Central Park, they decided to start their search there. They were all dressed with a costume that would make them go unnoticed amidst the crowd: jeans, blazers and black shoes. All the information about the clothing of the time and place had been obtained in the database of the ship. “Merko, we need to observe how they live here so we can create a capture plan. While we look for someone in the crowd, we can already devise strategies to make the capture as soon as we find them.” Crom said. “Okay. I know this is you specialty and I trust the task to you.” Merko replied. They spent hours in the park every day, observing the movement of people with their infrared glasses, which would reveal if there were a transmuted among them. After several days of observation, during which Merko’s men were positioned in strategic places to get a better reach and a larger view of the park, they saw a man with the red image showing heat and radiation. It was the signal that they needed to detect a transmuted. They observed the man, who entered into a food store and it was Drako. He looked everywhere and, although he was using his infrared glasses, he couldn’t distinguish his tormentors in front of an intense crowd. At the same time, the men of the Alpha-Omega team were also setting up a stakeout in several places of the city, but only the agent Netil had the glasses, a unique pair they had stolen from Silion, the alien captured years earlier. Even using reverse engineering they weren’t capable to copy the equipment. Thus, Alpha-Omega team had greater difficulty in the search for the aliens, because with only a pair of glasses, they couldn’t scan a very large area, so they would need to wait for some extraordinary event to reveal the presence of visitors from space. With a distance, Crom followed Drako for several blocks, taking great care not to be seen. He realized that he also carried the glasses and he had to be very cautious in his pursuit. Still hidden, he saw Drako entering a building, probably the apartment where he and his team were hiding. Crom reported to Merko, informing the location. After a brief meeting, during which an alien continued to peek the building, they decided that the best thing to do was to observe that place day and night, because it was certainly Sivoc’s hideout, so, they would find Nicolas there. It would be necessary surveillance of twenty-four hours, so all the movements could be detected and they could trace all the details of the routine of the residents of the building. After a few days, they knew exactly what the routine of every member of Science II was. Merko didn’t want to wait much longer, because he knew that in a few days they would have to cross the space-time passage. He left two soldiers guarding Sivoc, Drako and Zara, and decided to invade the gym where Nicolas and Tibor were, along with Crom and another soldier. *** One of Merko’s soldiers had already followed Nicolas and Tibor to the gym which they attended every day and had the coordinates of the location. After making sure that everything was right and informing its plans once again to Crom and the soldier would go with him, Merko and his companions teleported to the place. He saw the earthling entering the academy of fights, followed by Tibor. When Nicolas was training, Tibor came to him and said: “I’m having a bad feeling, boy. Whatever it is, if there is a problem, try to teleport yourself next to Zara, because she’ll know what to do.” Some seconds after Tibor’s warning, the three men invaded the academy. Alex approached one of them and asked who they were, but Merko, without listening, struck him in his throat. He moved away and continued to fight. Tibor asked Nicolas to get away and soon he was facing Crom, while Merko didn’t take his eyes off his main target, the earthling whose special defense cells were interesting to the inhabitants of the planet Vida. Tibor quickly sent a telepathic signal of danger to everyone from his team and started fighting with Crom. The fight seemed endless because of their mutual capacity. Tibor managed to immobilize Crom with a technical arm lock, a blow often used by the police to immobilize and knock out their opponent. Crom fell unconscious on the floor. Nicolas struggled with one of the soldiers and also managed to knock him down, but Merko got rid of Alex and quickly got to the earthling. When the young man grabbed him by the arm, the experienced soldier reversed the advantage by bending his arm and holding his neck with two fingers of his right hand, leaving him unconscious. “Tibor, you should be one of my officers!” Merko said. “I don’t agree with your methods.” Tibor replied promptly. The two of them approached, after Merko laid the unconscious Nicolas carefully in one of the closest walls. First, the commander tried a Kung-fu blow in Tibor’s throat, but his defense of Karate-do with the top of his right hand, threw a blow in Merko’s stomach. Despite the great skill of his opponent, Merko prepared an attack that no one had managed to escape before. It was an advanced blow, Aikido style. Tibor tried to hit him at the height of his liver, but his opponent turned around holding his arm, making him to hit his head against the wall and fall unconscious. Meanwhile, the members of the academy watched it all, perplexed, and thought it was a workout or some demonstration. They only noticed realized that the attacks were serious when Merko looked at them and pulled his laser gun, scaring them all and making them flee in terror. “Commander, we’d better stop now.” Crom warned Merko when he saw that everybody of the academy was running for their lives. He was getting up slowly; still dazed by the blow he had received. “The situation is already under control and we can’t catch even more attention to our existence. We need to get out of here quickly.” They used only the paralyzing rays to immobilize those who were present and to avoid major problems. They synchronized their watches to get out of there soon. Merko was furious because he didn’t like to leave witnesses to his actions during missions, but he remained silent. He, Crom, and the soldier who came as a support, teleported themselves to the ship carrying Nicolas as prisoner. The boy woke up inside the ship, on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. He looked through the window of the living room where he was and saw sharks and stingrays swimming around. He woke up a bit confused, but gradually began to remember what had happened in the gym. The air in the room was very clean; it seemed composed only of oxygen, which provided him a good sensation when breathing. Soon, however, his attention turned to the place where he was and he could notice that it was some kind of compartment of the ship similar to a bedroom. There was very few furniture, with only one place to lie and another one to sit, both with the shape that allowed the perfect fitting of a person. Nicolas was still watching the place of his captivity, when he heard somebody asking for permission to enter. “Welcome to Challenge I!” At this moment, Nicolas realized he was a prisoner and that his life could be in danger. The conversation was telepathic and the boy couldn’t avoid listening. “Looks like you really like technology. In the future we have the most powerful computers ever seen. But the telepathy used among us, from Planet Vida, and other powers of the mind that you do not know, can only be used by us and not by machines. It is a power inherent to the nature of our thoughts. To let the machines think can be very dangerous.” He paused for a moment, because he noticed the curious eyes of the young man. “I was forgetting to introduce myself; I am Commander Merko, from the planet Vida. As for you, there’s no need to presentations. We all know you.” “I haven’t heard good things about you.” Nicolas replied, frowning, not feeling comfortable with the unexpected presence of his visitor. “I don’t intend to please people. I want to have my job well done. Get comfortable, because in a few days, we’ll travel to planet Vida.” His tormentor left the room and the automatic door closed soon after his departure. Nicolas was scared. As soon as the commander exited, he felt his capacity was recovered. He had been stunned after the fight in the gym and a bit confused to see himself in a strange place. The shock of the unexpected encounter with the feared commander Merko, but, he cleared his mind. The boy was afraid with his imprisonment and wanted to get out of there anyway. He created many plans of escape in his thoughts, but the truth is that he didn’t know the ship Challenge and wouldn’t be easy to leave. Finally, he chose to use telekinesis, which, although it left him extremely tired, was the only trick he had. He concentrated on the objects he saw in the room and made them move to test the powers trained with Tibor. He moved the bed, which was released from the wall, and a table that levitated from the ground. He made them both spin. Then placed them back in their positions and felt himself in control of his mental strength. He looked at the door and opened it. Not very confident, but hopeful, he began to walk through the halls of the ship, slowly and scared, he thought about how he would manage to escape. Another door stood before him and, again he managed to open it. Behind the door, however, a tall shadow denounced Merko’s presence, which surprised the boy in time of the escape. He quickly looked at him, holding his arm tightly. “How did you escape from the room? The door was programmed for you not to leave.” Said the commander, confused to see the earthling wandering through the corridors of the ship. “Reading your mind I can figure out what happened.” Nicolas tried to use his telekinesis to move Merko up, but the commander seemed to annul his strength. He felt Merko invading his mind and was unable to hide his thoughts. “I see I’m not the only one who has the power of telekinesis. A simple earthling with such skill, how can it be? This is very strange.” The commander continued to analyze Nicolas’ mind, looking for answers, but he found out that the boy knew nothing about the source of his powers. He decided to put him it in the room again, but this time he prepared a prison with laser bars, that wouldn’t allow a new opportunity. “Somehow, the earthling managed to acquire the power of telekinesis and almost escaped.” Said Merko to Crom when he returned to the control room, after leaving the earthling trapped in the new cell immune to telekinesis. “How is it possible, Commander? I thought you were the one who had this ability.” “I definitely don’t know. When we get to planet Vida, I’ll ask our scientists to discover what happened to him. I won’t rest until we find out his secret.” Merko showed great concern over the discovery. He gesticulated a lot and seemed very nervous. He had never known anyone else who had this ability. “From what I noticed in his mind, not even he knows the source of his power. We’ll take him in safety and save our princess, this is our priority. Then, we’ll solve the other problem. I won’t allow anyone to have such power.” “The space-time gap will open in three Earth days, Commander.” “We need to prepare the ship for the voyage, Crom. Order the computer to analyze and optimize all operating systems immediately.” Merko said. Nicolas stood alone and realized that he was a prisoner, and the place wasn’t just a room but a cell. The furniture were embedded on the wall, in niches proportional to their sizes, where they automatically entered after being used. Nicolas’ sense of admiration for the ship’s technologies was shared with his fears, and how much he missed Zara and his family. “What happened to Zara and my friends? Are they alive?” He pondered. Sometimes, during the day, Merko went to the earthling’s room to make sure everything was okay. He worried about his health, because he had to take him in good conditions for the surgery. After the escape attempt, he was also interested in studying him, because the power of the earthling surprised him. XIV. Waiting for the Trip Sivoc, Drako and Zara arrived at the gym and there was Tibor, unconscious and lying on the ground. Around him, several students were unconscious; some of them seemed not to be breathing anymore. “Take care of Tibor and the others who are alive, we need to get out of here as soon as possible.” Sivoc said. “Why did you take so long?” Tibor asked while standing up. He was still quite dizzy and a little confused. “There were two men of Merko’s team watching us. I asked help to Drako and we managed to neutralize them, but it cost us some time that seemed very precious. We used laser handcuffs and imprisoned them in our apartment.” Sivoc replied. “Now, what do we do?” Zara asked, feeling anxious. “We’ll remove any trace of our presence here on Earth and return home, to outline a new plan. In three days, the portal will open near the planet Jupiter and the Calisto moon and we need to get to planet Vida along with Merko’s team. Nicolas’ life is in danger, because we don’t know what they will do after the removal of his bone marrow. Certainly, Councilor Mirov won’t obey the order of King Zador II to bring the earthling back to Earth safely.” Sivoc said. Tibor teleported himself first and was resting in the ship, recovering from the fight and from his injuries, while the others finished all the necessary adjustments for the departure. “Drako, did you manage to warn the emergency services to come to the academy and help the wounded?” Asked Zara. “Affirmative, doctor. I have taken all the necessary arrangements. There is no way to track us and everyone had been advised.” As they prepared to leave, the Alpha-Omega team entered the academy, Collin, Ann, and several Special Forces soldiers of the American army. With the special infrared glasses, Collin had followed the aliens, what led them directly to the place of the struggle. When they notice the aliens were still there, they began to use weapons of electrical discharge to try to immobilize and possibly capture them. Collin and Sivoc began a body fight, and Zara teleported herself holding agent Ann behind. Drako used a weapon of sound waves he had pulled from underneath his jacket and the soldiers fell to the ground. Sivoc managed to dominate the agent who fainted. Then Drako and Sivoc looked at agent Ann, who raised her arms and surrendered. Sivoc didn’t want Zara to fight because it was risky for the embryo she carried in her womb. They used a sleeping radius in everyone and a white smoke covered the environment of the academy while they returned to the ship. *** Sivoc’s team fled immediately. They knew that the military reinforcements were on the way. They removed any sign of their presence in New York and decided to teleport themselves to the ship, where they would finish the preparations for the trip. They also needed to verify if the ship had been found by Merko or had been sabotaged. They took the two soldiers of Merko’s team they had imprisoned in Sivoc’s apartment and put them in a cell in the ship Science II. They couldn’t let the m behind on the planet at the mercy of the extraterrestrial capture agents. “Where is Nicolas?” After ensuring the safety of everyone who was present, Zara couldn’t stop thinking about him. They must be waiting for the opening of the wormhole somewhere on the planet. Our chance to save the boy will be to follow them to the planet Vida.” Sivoc replied. “Somehow I feel that he is alive”, thought the doctor. The Science II had been carefully checked, in every single detail, so everyone’s safety could be guaranteed. Zara was the first to realize that Little Wolf had been immobilized. So, everyone knew that Merko and his men had been there. “Certainly he used the computers of the ship to try to find our coordinates of teleport. But Drako camouflaged the data, I have no idea how they managed to find us. What it’s really weird, however, is the fact that they let us live. It doesn’t match with Merko’s methods.” Sivoc concluded. Drako prepared the ship for the voyage back to their planet and repaired the robot dog. He searched for some information on the nature of the monitors that could show what the plans of Merko were, but there was nothing important in the records about his presence. Zara went to her room and began to telepathically focus, hoping to establish contact with her love. She couldn’t lose hope of finding him alive and well. *** Merko’s military ship wasn’t far from Science II. Inside the vehicle, Nicolas was also focused, doing the meditation exercises taught by Tibor. There wasn’t much to do as a prisoner and this was his only hope, although it was small, to get some contact with his friends. “Nick, can you hear me?” Zara said, telepathically. “Yes, I can hear you, Zara! I’m so relieved to get some contact with you. I was already losing hope, because I’m trying to communicate for hours.” “Are you all right, my dear? Are you badly injured?” “I’m fine. I’m not hurt, but I’m locked in a cell.” “On Merko’s ship?” “Exactly.” Nicolas confirmed. “I’m somewhere on the bottom of the sea. There are fish and marine animals everywhere. I can’t say more than that. But where are you?” The communication between the two was difficult due to the presence of many rocks in place. It didn’t matter to Nicolas and Zara, because they were both calmer knowing they were fine. However, they couldn’t imagine that Challenge I and Science II were so close, because Merko’s plan was to capture Sivoc and his team and freeze them when they were together. “I’m in the ship Science II.” “Zara, are you okay? Is Tibor there with you?” “He is Nick. Tibor is still a little stunned, but he had no serious injuries. We are all fine here in the ship.” “Zara, I’m afraid! Can you help me?” “We can’t know what your exact location is, but we will try to reach you on our planet. Take care and be quiet, Merko is very dangerous. We will do everything we can to rescue you, Nick.” Zara replied. *** Merko managed to telepathically intercept the communication between the earthling and Zara and knew that the crew of the Science II had already arrived. He immediately called Crom and two other men to invade the ship and capture the crew. They materialized in the infirmary of the ship Science II and, with a pistol, they froze Tibor, who was resting and recovering from his injuries. “One less, Commander.” Crom said. “Let’s get the others.” “Crom, proceed with discretion. The surprise will be our greatest ally.” They went to the engineering room and turned off the entire propulsion system of the ship, inactivating it for the flight. They also released the other two soldiers of their team who had been imprisoned. “Sir, I programmed the ship to restart the engines in one Earth year, according to your plan.” Sivoc was with Drako in the control room when all the systems turned off. Everything went dark, and the emergency lights lit, leaving the place dimly illuminated. Drako, realizing that something was wrong, had the brilliant idea to turn off the Little Wolf for the programmed period of a day. If anything happened, the robot would return to its active duty on the next day and could follow the rescue protocol configured on its system. Within minutes, Merko, Crom and his soldiers were in the control room. They pointed their guns at Sivoc and Drako, while another soldier pointed his gun at Tibor, who was taken there already frozen, as a hostage, to persuade the surrender of the remaining crew of the Science II. “If you make a move, we’ll shoot Tibor.” Merko said, pointing a laser gun at him. Sivoc and Drako stopped and were also frozen. Crom went toward Zara’s room to catch the doctor. “What do you want now? Haven’t you got exactly what you wanted? You imprisoned Nicolas, who was under our care, when our mission was almost accomplished.” “You’ll sleep on this ship for one year, doctor. When you get to planet Vida, we’ll have already finished the mission and you won’t be on our way. Commander Merko and I will be promoted by saving Princess Isadora.” “You’re crazy. Don’t you know that the adviser Mirov is not a trustworthy person? He’s selfish, wicked and will certainly sacrifice the earthling. Please, Crom, don’t do it. You and Merko will regret for delivering a helpless earthling to Mirov like a worm.” “You don’t know what you’re saying, Zara. The purpose of our mission is to save the princess, and Mirov himself will take care of it. We won’t hurt the earthling.” After that, Crom pointed his cryogenic gun at Zara and froze her within seconds. He put his hand on her and they teleported to the control room, where all the crewmembers of Science II were already frozen. Merko and his team took everyone to the cryogenic chambers, which were used for long trips to preserve the bodies and keep them alive until the arrival. They scheduled the unfreezing and the revitalization of the crew for a year and, so, they also planned Science II for the trip. Merko and the others returned to their ship. *** Nicolas tried to speak with Zara again, but with no success. He didn’t know that from now on he was alone and unprotected, but he felt a little pain in his chest as if something was wrong. Crom took Challenge I to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a place known as Mariana Trench, more than eleven thousand meters deep. There, any team that could be looking for them wouldn’t reach them, and it would be possible to wait for the right time for the long-awaited return to their planet. Merko asked Crom to contact his master on the planet Vida and tell him they were on their way. *** Mirov was anxious. Everything was happening as he had planned. He would sabotage the bone marrow transplant that would save Princess Isadora and would kill the earthling during the procedure blaming the surgeons. With the death of Princess Isadora, the King would go into depression and would be weakened. Then, he would ask to his servant, infiltrated on the personal service of the king, to poison him. So, there would be only Kenan as an obstacle, but this one wouldn’t cause him trouble, because he was old. He would let the counselor rot in a prison and would take all the power for himself. Nobody knew Mirov’s plans, not even Merko, who was loyal to Zador’s Kingdom and he believed he was only efficiently following the orders of the King. Despite eliminate his opponents in his mission, and leave no traces of this presence, Merko always wanted to perform his jobs effectively and with responsibility. He had qualities like honor and respect, and devoted his life to his King. He planned to freeze and postpone the trip Science II’s crew to avoid obstructions to his plan and to immobilize his rivals in that mission. He couldn’t imagine, however, that he was helping a traitor.",

      "content": "– XV. The Arrival at Planet Vida – The ship Challenge I emerged from the sea and flew at a super speed towards the opening timeline that was formed between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. It traveled in propulsion, with the engines of space warp. In the control room, Crom said: “Mr. Commander, we achieved a good pass and approached our planet. Let’s prepare for the arrival.” *** Nicolas looked through a window formed by a material similar to glass and contemplated the wonders of the Universe. When they approached the planet Vida, the boy gasped admiring the solar system, which was the new home of mankind. He saw how the planet Vida was similar to Earth. “They always said that there were planets similar to ours, but this is too equal, even with water in abundant quantities. I see forests, waterfalls and different birds flying between the trees; flowers of many qualities and beautiful mountains creating landscapes like the ones in Earth and the ocean surrounding the continent. And that’s weird... apparently the continent is only one, like in the early days of our planet.” He shared feelings of fear, anguish and admiration in his mind and heart. He didn’t know what would happen from there, because Zara was no longer at his side with her friends to protect him. He was alone and feared what the future would hold. *** In the ship Sicence II, one day after the freezing of the crew, the bright eyes of Little Wolf lit a red light. He searched for Drako throughout the ship and didn’t find him. The smart robot dog launched a holographic image with radar that came from his muzzle and saw the signs of the presence of the four-crew members of the ship in the laboratory. He went there and the door opened. He observed them frozen in their cryogenic chambers for a few seconds. He looked at Drako, groaned and pressed the button to open the chamber with his right foot. Drako began to unfreeze, regaining his consciousness, coughing. Wet, he rose scared. “What happened? Little Wolf... You... What a good dog! Thank you. Let’s unfreeze the others.” Drako began to release the other and soon they were all ready and gathered to plan a way to save Nicolas. Sivoc ordered Drako: “Go to the engineering room and connect all the ship’s systems. We need to prepare our departure immediately. The portal is now open, and we need to take advantage to travel as soon as possible. Congratulations, Drako, for the brilliant idea to program Little Wolf to release us. Our chances of saving the Nicolas and Princess Isadora increased due to this.” “Thanks to Little Wolf and Drako, we’ll have the opportunity to reach Merko’s ship. Tibor, let’s go to the infirmary. I need to take care of you.” Zara said. The ship Science II departed for the planet Vida and approached the orbit of the planet, Sivoc contacted the advisor Kenan. “Mr. Counselor, we’ve arrived to our planet.” “Is the earthling with you?” Asked Kenan. “No, sir. Merko’s team intercepted us and now Nicolas is under his custody.” “Certainly Mirov has a plan in mind for the earthling. We need to find out what it is.” Said the Counselor, concerned. *** In the king’s palace, they reported that the earthling had arrived, and he was very hopeful. Isadora was in his bed, and the king was watching her in her sleep. He thought how beautiful she was. She seemed to smile while sleeping and let out soft gasps during sleep. So, the king called Kenan and said: “Please, make a report of the situation. I want to know how the earthling is and when we begin the preparations for the surgery.” “Your majesty, I’ll bring all the answers as soon as possible.” Answered Kenan, who quickly searched for Mirov to ask him about the earthling. “How are you, Mirov? I’ve heard that Merko and his team arrived from the planet Earth.” “Yes, Kenan. Everything went as planned. Merko and his entire team are fine, and the earthling is healthy and ready for the surgery.” Mirov replied. “I don’t understand why you took the earthling from Sivoc’s custody. You could have gathered your forces and helped the scientific team to accomplish their purpose. It wasn’t necessary the use of force in this mission, and the team of Science II had the situation under control. Instead of this, you acted with pride and calculation, risking the success of the plan.” Kenan said, closing his fists. “You know how commander Merko likes to act in his missions. The important thing is that he always fulfills his orders.” Mirov replied. “What matters now is the possibility to save the princess. Let’s start the preparations as soon as possible. I’ll give the orders for the surgical team to be ready to start anytime.” Kenan knew Zara would bring the genetic information of the earthling in her womb and was prepared for any nasty plan of Mirov. *** The king remained in his palace, walking from one side to the other, anxious about the possibility, now concrete, to save his beloved daughter. Tonight he couldn’t sleep. He took advantage of the insomnia to look to what his people had built over generations. The royal palace was a good example of how much they had evolved since the time from where the boy was coming. Everything was planned as a system of sustainable environment just like all the houses and apartments of the planet Vida. They used the maximum possible of glassy materials in its construction, with cells for absorption of solar energy. Miniature nuclear reactors for each housing unit ensured the necessary energy. All the water used on the entire planet was recycled. The integrity of this green technology was deployed all over the planet and not just in the palace. But the royal house had some perks too. The palace was the most luxurious place on planet Vida. It was a castle with three floors, big enough to house three thousand people. Even in the future, the monarchy favored the royal family. The main room had about a thousand square meters; it was gleaming and had many crystals. It was flanked by entries of corridors, which leaded to thirteen bedrooms, all prepared with luxury and comfort for guests and the royal family. The presence of gardens, trees, lakes and fountains provided the beauty to the outside part of the beautiful place. From the balcony of his room, the biggest in the palace, the king had a privileged view of a garden, which vegetation marveled those who could observe it. The front garden of the palace also had a large fountain around it, from which the big ships of visitors arrived to the palace. On the sky, the king observed the ships that worked with clean energy: they used cells of nuclear reactors of hydrogen that powered the entire fleet. Again the thoughts of the monarch turned to improvements experienced by his people. There was almost no private transport, to avoid the excess of traffic, what made the traffic jams almost nonexistent. All the green area of the planet was preserved, with reforestation and management of existing forests whenever necessary. However, this didn’t occur very often, because the use of paper was avoided to the maximum, the inhabitants of the planet used digital images and documents almost exclusively. The security for the inhabitants of the planet was also quite effective. Police used paralyzing rays, and the prisons weren’t overcrowded, they functioned as centers of rehabilitation and work with for those few who were sent there. Only soldiers used weapons, and, even then, such use was not so frequent. Education, health and safety had improved much in comparison to the past. In contrast, the psychological problems of the future human beings had increased, maybe because the society was more open and prone to treatments and because of some prejudice in the past. They evolved a lot until they accept to talk about their mental problems without fear. This was one of the major problems of this society. Fortunately, the health system was very good and could treat all the cases of psychological problems of the planet’s inhabitants. The king sighed hopeful. The planet Vida was progressing in a way that made him proud. He knew he was a good monarch and was doing everything in his power to make the lives of his servants easier and enjoyable. Besides, he also guaranteed, with the help of his advisers that all measures of ecological prevention were taken in order to keep the environment in which they lived healthy. And he always reinforced it with awareness programs the importance of the environmental preservation with those who lived in Vida. Now, the only problem for which they still hadn’t found any solution would be solved. His beloved daughter would be healed and he could live in peace. He couldn’t wait to see the result of the surgery.",

      "content": "– XVI. In King Zador’s Palace – Nicolas was in a room in the building of the advisors, beside the royal palace, when Mirov and Kenan came to meet him. He kept his alien form not to contradict Merko. The boy was anxious to leave his condition of prisoner. The counselors entered his room, which was watched by two security guards. “So, earthling, how was the trip?” Kenan asked to break the ice. “Sivoc’s team treated me with great respect and education. Merko brutally fought with us and imprisoned me in his ship. I think you should look for Zara and the others, they may be in trouble or in danger.” Nicolas did not trust anyone at this point, based on Merko’s actions he felt he could be among enemies. “We brought him here in order to save our princess with his defense cells, as you should already know.” Kenan said to the counselor. “Zara explained everything to me and I promptly accepted to do everything I can to help. However, now I’m full of doubts about the true purpose of my visit to this planet.” “Wanting or not you have no other option than to help us. “ Mirov declared. “Please, Mirov, this is not how we do things here.” Kenan wanted to calm the earthling down and show that the inhabitants of Vida were good hosts and never wanted to harm him. “The kid must be comfortable, and stress wouldn’t help to keep his cellular defenses healthy. The king would never approve to force the earthling against his will.” “Kenan, you don’t need to give me moral lessons. I just want to finish what we started and save the princess.” Mirov replied with a silly look. “I hope you have in mind that I am also a human being and I have the right to express my will.” The boy interrupted, annoyed with the discussion, which seemed to exclude him, and afraid about what they could do with him. “I intend, however, to help healing the princess.” “There’s no need to rush, all the preparations are being made for everything to happen as perfectly as possible.” Mirov said, staring into Nicolas’ eyes. “We’re not being educated, we forgot to introduce ourselves. I’m Kenan, and this one beside me and is Mirov.” Kenan said, showing the counselor at his side. “We are the king Zador II’s counselors, who would like to meet you too. It is a pleasure to welcome you on our planet.” “It will be my pleasure to help your princess. I just want to be treated like the human being I am, with respect and dignity.” Said Nicolas, feeling a little angered by the treatment he had been receiving since Merko’s team captured him. “I apologize and ask for your comprehension because of the situation we’re going through. We are all concerned about the life of our princess, which is hanging by a thread. You are the one who can save her, our last hope.” Explained Kenan while Mirov just frowning, watching the conversation. “You are a guest here on our planet, so you can consider yourself as a free human being. We’ll be more careful now to show our true hospitality. We’re a very welcoming people, and you’ll be very well treated here in Vida. I only ask you not to leave the royal palace, because we need to protect you and keep you healthy for the surgery. I believe you want to meet the members of the Science II again.” “But how...?” Mirov interrupted. “Where are they? I thought they were still on planet Earth.” “They had just arrived safe and sound here on the planet.” Kenan looked at Nicolas with a smile and then turned to face his partner on the royal council. “Why did you get so surprised, Mirov? Would there be any reason for them not being here?” Mirov was speechless and just nodded with his head negatively. He was furious for being insulted in front of the earthling and to know that Science II was back to the planet. He needed to do whatever was possible to follow through with his original plan and get the throne. Nicolas was thrilled with the possibility to see Zara, and relieved that his friends from Science II were well and safe on the same planet as him. After being trapped by the commander Merko, he thought he would never see the woman who was now the reason of his existence, or any of his new friends. He was anxiously waiting for this moment. *** Then, Kenan, Mirov and Nicolas went to the royal palace along with the security guards. They were greeted by a royal reception and Nicolas noticed that the king and his daughter were waiting to meet him. Zador II was short and wore a golden robe that covered his slender back. His chin seemed more tapered than the other of the inhabitants of Vida. He wore no crown. As a symbol of his power he held a golden bat in his hands. His face was grayish-white and his glace seemed tired, due to his daughter health problems. The girl was even thinner, but very beautiful. She was lying in a bed beside her father’s seat and stood up as soon as the visitor came close. Nicolas could see she was a very frail girl with curious blue eyes that showed her will to live, but were flanked by heavy dark circles which revealed the terrible disease the girl was struggling. On the next week would be her birthday, and the best present was the recovery of her health. “Hello, Nicolas, nice to meet you. I’m Princess Isadora. I hope you’re enjoying our planet and that you’re being well treated here. “Nice to meet you, Nicolas. I’m the king Zador II, ruler of the planet Vida that hosts you now. My dear young man, excuse us for bringing you for the future like this, but we really need your help. I’ve heard that Merko escorted you, and he, sometimes, overreact in his attitudes.” “It is a pleasure to meet you, your Royal Highness, Princess.” Nicolas took a little bow to the girls, who immediately lie down on her bed again. She looked extremely fragile. He turned to the king and took a slightly longer bow. “It’s a pleasure to be in your presence, your majesty. The staff of Sivoc, who found me on Earth first, treated me very well. They explained the situation of the princess and my greatest desire is to help in every way possible. That’s what I told them when they asked me about my will. However, since Merko captured me, I lost my freedom, which is so dear to me, and I’ve been treated as a prisoner, which displeases me a lot. I believe the best for Merko and his team would be to collaborate with Sivoc, I’d have come to planet Vida very willingly to help your daughter. I just wish to be free at this time. I have no reason to run away. Besides, I don’t know how to return to the past, or to my galaxy.” “My daughter and I would like you to have dinner with us tonight. It would be a pleasure to welcome you in the palace, Nicolas. You’re free here in this planet and we’ll only protect you to maintain your integrity and ensure the success of the mission.” Said the king. “I don’t want you to think you’re a prisoner and I apologize for any oversight of our search teams. The eagerness to bring the solution to the princess’ problem may have hindered the way they treated you. “Apologies accepted your majesty. It will be a pleasure to dine at your company.” *** In the scientific building, which stood near the royal palace, Sivoc, Zara, Drako and Tibor were gathered to decide what to do. “Sivoc, what do you think it will happen now with Nicolas?” Asked Zara. “I don’t know, but judging by how Merko took him from us on Earth, anything can happen. On the other hand, I think Merko wanted to bring him safety to the planet Vida and fulfill the mission for which he was assigned. The greatest danger lies in the intentions of director Mirov. This man is unpredictable.” “And what can we do to help you?” Asked the doctor. “We have to be aware of this surgery and try to protect the earthling.” Said the commander. “Let’s go, Tibor. You, Drako, Zara and me will talk to the king and explain everything that happened. Counselor Kenan will certainly hear us.” *** They went to the royal palace, but were prevented from entering by the officers who were guarding the entrance. “You can’t enter the palace. These are Counselor Mirov’s orders.” Sivoc was stunned, because he always had free access to the palace. Telepathically he called Counselor Kenan and they stood waiting for him.” “Please, release the entry for these people. Sivoc and his team work with me.” Kenan arrived breathless, rushing to help his teammates. “The King is very satisfied and hopeful with Merko’s mission. What happened there? How did they manage to get the earthling from you?” “Mr. Counselor, Merko and his soldiers attacked us and took the earthling by force from our custody.” Told Sivoc. “He even killed some people in Earth, almost altering the course of history and disregarding the ethical rules of time travel. It seems strange to me that Counselor Mirov is giving orders preventing our entry into the palace. It was the first time this has happened since we began to work for the government.” “Very quirky and dangerous this attitude of Merko, but what makes me worried now is Mirov’s attitude. What is he planning? I don’t understand why he used so much force to perform this mission. When I heard that he took the earthling from your team, I questioned Counselor Mirov about his methods.” Kenan said. “I believe you’d be able to perfectly finish this mission without Merko’s intervention. I also don’t understand why Mirov doesn’t want you near the palace. I’ve already been suspicious of his attitudes for some time, so I asked Zara to prepare an alternative plan. But we’d better not talk about this for now. It’s our secret. I’ll take the case to the king, as soon as we finish the surgical process and we finally have the solution for the princess’ problem.” “We have to keep an eye on Counselor Mirov.” Sivoc said. “I fear that his intentions aren’t good and that Nicolas is in danger. We can put one of our men to protect the earthling with those who are already there to maintain his integrity and ensure the success of the mission.” “Okay, good idea, Sivoc. Who do you suggest, commandant?” “Tibor, with no doubt. He recovered from the fights against the crew and is already prepared to return to work. I trust him completely.” “Please, use the intelligence and avoid the use of force.” Replied the counselor. “Does anyone of you want to see Nicolas? I knew you became good friends. Of course Zara has one more reason, because she bears a fruit of his life inside her. Don’t comment about the child, not even telepathically. That would be very dangerous for everyone.” “Of course, sir.” Zara said. “None of us will mention the subject from now on, and we’ll be very discreet. I really wish to see Nicolas.” “To avoid problems, I think it would be better if only Zara saw him for a while. She will take the news that everyone is fine, and after the surgery the others will be able to see him too.” Zara looked at her friends, who nodded in agreement. Everyone knew that there was a bigger involvement between him and her, so, the first one to see him should be her. “I’ll be waiting in the garden in front of the palace.” Said the doctor. “Okay, Zara. I’ll be back to pick you up as soon as you receive the king’s permission for the visit. Tibor, I ask you to wait here as well, because I will put you as Nicolas’ bodyguard as soon as possible. The others are dismissed.” Everyone nodded while Kenan quickly returned to the palace. *** After dinner, Kenan approached the king and discreetly asked permission to take the earthling to meet Zara. “I’m glad they all came back fine. No doubt you have my permission. However, I ask that everyone should be getting ready for the big day tomorrow. Will Zara attend the surgery?” Asked the king. “No, your majesty. She is very tired because of the mission and needs to recover. However, I ask permission for Tibor to integrate Nicolas’ security team. He is a man full I trust completely and I believe it is necessary.” Kenan said. “Certainly, Counselor Kenan. I allow Tibor to integrate Nicolas’ security team. Ask him to accompany the earthling in his meeting with Zara. But it’s a brief encounter, because the kid is also tired from the trip and will have to face a complicated surgery tomorrow.” “Understood, your majesty. It will be a quick meeting. I myself will accompany him with Tibor.” *** Kenan and Tibor escorted Nicolas to the royal garden. Mirov, who followed them to the gate, but let them go when he saw Sivoc and his team at the palace entrance, observed them. Zara saw Nicolas coming in the alien form and got very happy, with a big smile, and tears came to her eyes. Nicolas ran and hugged her. “My dear, how I missed you!” Exclaimed the doctor. “Zara, I was desperate to see you. What about our son?” “It’s a daughter. We can’t mention this because it’s our secret and it can be dangerous.” “I hope she’s beautiful and smart like her mother.” “You’re very gentle.” Zara said smiling. “Everything’s alright with me and her, but from now we won’t talk about this anymore. Mirov has spies everywhere. We need to be discreet.” “Please, this meeting has to be brief.” Kenan interrupted. “The boy needs to rest for the surgery tomorrow. Tibor, you are now in charge of his safety. I’ll leave now and let you talk freely.” “Thank you for the opportunity, Counselor.” Zara said while Kenan was already leaving. “We’ll be together after my surgery and we have a lot to talk about.” Nicolas said. “Once we save the princess, I’d like you to come with me to Earth. We can’t change the fact that either here or over there, there will be a transformation of our destinies or maybe is our destiny to go through this transformation.” “I’ll go with you wherever you want. The sensation of losing you I had after Merko took you. I felt I must stay at your side. But it must stay between us. It is against our rules to become involved with people from the past and not change the history. But we can’t think about it now, because some of us can read minds, even without authorization. Let’s wait for right time to think about it.” Zara said. “It will be difficult, but I will try, and our daughter will be born on the planet Earth with us.” Nicolas replied, smiling. Sivoc and Drako just waved to Nicolas. “Drako, monitor all the communications from the palace, the Council and also from the scientific building. Do everything with secrecy. The king has already given permission for us to have the control of Nicolas’ security. Many lives depend on it. If there is any plan to undermine the success of the surgery, we have to figure out and fast, because soon they will begin the bone marrow transplant that will give the princess the blood cells to cure her. Tibor will be next to the earthling all the time to guarantee his safety. “All right, Commander.” *** The Alpha-Omega team of the U.S. government began to investigate the events that took place at gym. Many witnesses reported how the fights happened and the use of paralyzing guns caught the attention of everyone who was there. The research team of extraterrestrial cases quickly went to the place. Agent Netil and agent Soliver were investigating the surroundings in New York. There was no doubt that those technologies of paralyzing rays were not from Earth. The chief of the team himself, Mr. Ronald Steighen, decided to personally go to the place in search for alien remains. The event coincided with the use of antigravity in the prison of the Central Park’s gang. Some activity in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico was noticed by radar, but they found no traces of aliens in the region. The agents of the Alpha-Omega did everything but didn’t manage to find any alien or concrete proof of their visit. *** Journalist Andrew Thomas also attended the place and was prevented from taking pictures or interviewing people involved in the case. The press was prohibited from approaching, because they argued that the case was of national security nature. Andrew reported the fact to his boss, who told him: “There’s something very strange to prevent the work of the press. They said that people were motionless as statues and sophisticated weapons, that didn’t seem to be from our planet. How I wish I could find out the truth about these facts! Andrew, stay tuned for any chance to get information about this case. Don’t forget to investigate the levitation of the Central Park’s gang too. I’m foreseeing a connection between the two cases. It seems the end of a rope that, if pulled, it’ll bring us a great gift.” “Mr. Dither, I will do everything possible to investigate the facts and bring you good news.” *** In Mirov’s room, the counselor approached his assistant and said: “Radof, everything is set for the operation. Do your part as agreed. Enter the operating room and replace the marrow for the other I sent you. If needed, take someone else with you.” “Yes, sir. Merko is responsible for the security of the building where the surgery is being done. Since he’s subordinate to you, I believe that there will be problems.” Little did they know that their evil plan had been registered by the robot-bird placed by Drako to fly throughout Counselor Mirov’s room.",

      "title": "– XVII. The Surgery –",
      "content": "– XVII. The Surgery – The big day arrived, and Nicolas was been carefully prepared for surgery. The best surgeons were chosen for the operation. The anesthesiologist put the mask over the nostrils of the earthling and he fell asleep while the anesthetic liquor was applied in one of the veins in his left arm. Then, he slept deeply and his life was placed in the hands of the best surgeons of the planet Vida. A red light lit on Merko’s sunglasses. He put them on, and a holographic image was projected in front of him. Mirov got in touch, ordering him to watch over the earthling, so that the whole plan could work with perfection. Drako intercepted the communication and immediately communicated Sivoc, who oriented Tibor to protect Nicolas. “Tibor, don’t stop watching the earthling. Don’t allow the entrance of anyone, and if Merko try anything, you have orders to disintegrate him. During yesterday’s dinner, we put a nano-robot with a super load of nano-explosives in commander Merko’s food. At this point, it must have adhered to the lining of his intestines, where it will remain for thirty- six hours before being expelled. Just push the booster pen that’s in your pocket and he’ll blow up. *** Already outside the operating room, Tibor looked at the laser pen, which was placed on his blouse and adjusted it carefully. “I’m sorry for what happened.” Said Merko approaching. “You know that I have to fulfill my missions and, for that, I’m capable of doing whatever it takes.” “Who knows? Maybe we’ll have a rematch...” Tibor said. “We need to protect the earthling, and this is our priority. My duty is to serve the king Zador II and I’ll do whatever it takes to help Princess Isadora.” “I have nothing against you, Tibor. On the contrary, I admire you for your loyalty and dedication. Let’s work together; I also yearn to serve my king.” Merko said. “Merko” Counselor Mirov said telepathically, communicating with the soldier “My servant will go to the operating room, under my orders, to see the boy. I want to make sure that the whole process will happen with no problems. Please offer protection and security to him.” “Tibor, another communication was made. Mirov sent his servant, Radof. He asked the help of Merko. Don’t let anyone enter the operating room. It’s an express order.” Drako said, communicating telepathically. It seemed that the rematch was imminent. While Merko and Tibor watched the surgery through a glass wall, apparently, everything was fine. The surgeons and nurses worked with perfection. Merko and Tibor watched and observed in the holographic screen in front of them, which showed the blood characteristics, blood pressure, the DNA of the defense cells of Nicolas and all his vital data. So, Merko looked at holography and stared at the DNA of the earthling’s white blood cells. “That’s weird... the purine and pyrimidine bases of the chromosome string of the white blood cells follow the same sequences than mine. It can’t be.” Merko said to himself. Merko knew his DNA’s strand because it was what he liked to study at the Military College: his own DNA sequence of his defense cells. “But this could only be possible if he was my son.” He thought again. He remembered Lorena, the night of love he had when he took the place of the major he killed. The age of the earthling coincided with the time of his visit on Earth. “This is my son! Now I understand why his form looks so much like my manners. I let him grow up without a father, abandoned his mother and yet he became a good human being.” Reflected Merko. Tibor realized that Merko was too agitated and decided to talk to him: “What’s going on?” “I’m sure this earthling is my son.” He said. “How can it be?” Tibor replied. “You must be joking.” But Tibor knew that Merko was a serious soldier, of few words, and didn’t used to make jokes. “It’s a long story. I executed a mission on Earth twenty-three years ago, before this earthling was born. I became involved with a woman in the same country where Nicolas lives and now I see the DNA of his defense cells in the holography, it’s very similar to mine. In the mission, I took the place of his father, a major in the U.S. Army, and I ended up having a relationship with his mother. Please, Tibor, that was my secret, you know we can’t relate to people from the past. This could ruin my career.” “There’s no doubt, he is your son. The DNA doesn’t lie.” Said a surprised Tibor. “You’re the first person I know who decorated its DNA sequence. About keeping secrets, don’t worry, that’s what I do best.” “It was my hobby in college, decorating the DNA sequence of my white blood cells. Although it’s rare, I have holographic memory. Thanks for keeping my secret. I still need to think about what I will do about it.” “I think we have a problem here, Merko. Drako informed me that Mirov ordered his servant to enter the room and swapped Nicolas’ marrow by another one that won’t save the princess.” Tibor said alarmed. Since Merko had trusted him to tell an important secret, he thought he could rely on the integrity of the commander to make him understand Mirov’s dark purposes. “Please, let’s work together and protect him. I ask for your help, Merko, because now it’s the safety of your son and the Princess Isadora. Let’s forget the past. The reason now is far more relevant to all of us and we are on the same side.” “I always dreamed of having a son. Now I understand how good is the feeling of being a father and the reason why this boy have such good defense, bearing the lymphocytes X. Probably it was the result of the miscegenation between the man of the past with the man of the future, combining their genetic.” Reflected Merko. “I can’t let the son I had just conquered take any risk.” “We have reasons to believe that Counselor Mirov doesn’t want the princess to be saved. That’s why we are monitoring the communications in the royal palace with the authorization of the monarch. We can’t allow the entrance of anyone. I was sent to protect the earthling.” Tibor said. Merko shook hands with Tibor and smiling, he said: “We’re on the same side. Consider me your friend. We’ll keep my son safe and ensure that the princess will receive what she needs to be healed.” *** In the operating room, Nicolas was quite sedated, and the operation was happening normally. The surgeons removed the bone marrow of the earthling and began the suture’s maneuvers. Meanwhile, other surgeons anesthetized princess Isadora, who was now sleeping deeply. “I received the order to prepare the sedation of the princess, because the earthling surgery is ending, and the material will be brought soon. We can start the first incisions and then move forward to the operation.” Said the surgeon chief. The doctors looked at the monitors positioned in haplographies and all the vital signs of the girl were in order. In the operating room of the earthling, the surgeons have completed the last suture, and the material removed from Nicolas was ready to be transported to the room where Isadora was. It was carefully placed in a container. The most delicate part of Nicolas’ operation had ended, but Isadora’s was just beginning. *** One of the surgeons took the material and waited to confirm the identity of who would carry it. He expected the final order of the surgeon chief, which chose the nurse and, for security reasons, he would summon him as soon as the patient was surgically prepared for transplantation. Mirov searched for information about the nurse. One of his spies identified who would collect the material, and Radof, after obtaining them, went to the nursing room and called him to warn that it was time to collect the material of the surgery and carry it to the room of the receiving patient. While the nurse walked down the hospital corridor, Radof stealthily approached as if he were escorting him and suddenly pushed him into a room. He disintegrated him with a laser, and, collecting his saliva, transmuted himself into the young man. Radof walked into the operating room taking the false marrow in a sealed container, equal to the one that would carry Nicolas’ lymphocytes. The next step would be to replace the material surgically removed from the earthling, when it was being transported to the room, in a hallway near there, where the princess’ surgery was being performed. He just had to exchange the containers and sabotage the mission. So he arrived in the operating room to sneak in and perform the malicious exchange. Mirov’s plan would be completed and his boss would be pleased. “Nobody gets in here, only doctors.” With a gruff voice, Merko prevented Radof from entering. “What? I’m the nurse that will collect the material to take it to the room where the princess is.” “I can’t allow that anyone enters before checking the information. Our priority is the safety of Princess Isadora and our visitor.” Merko replied. “I have orders not to let anyone enter.” Merko personally sought information about the nurse who would take the material and noted that the young man was the person that the holographic image of the hospital’s computer reported. “The information match, you can enter.” “Please, Tibor, accompany the material until the surgery and don’t take your eyes off him. I’d like that you and Crom also watch the princess’ surgery. It’s our duty to protect the daughter of our king. I’ll be here watching Nicolas.” Radof, after collecting Nicolas’ bone marrow, walked, holding a briefcase in his hand, which had the two containers. His intention was to discharge the material at the first opportunity he could find, however, Tibor and Crom were escorting him attention. Suddenly, Drako contacted Tibor: “One of Mirov’s assistants, Radof, left the council chamber some time ago, went to the operating room and I didn’t see him on palace’s camera nor in the hospital’s. I have a single record of him passing through the corridors of the nursing’s sector. Did you find him?” “There’s no sign of him so far.” “Stay tuned, Tibor, because he’s close. I heard his conversation with Counselor Mirov, planning to do some harm to the princess.” “Leave it with me; I’m personally watching all the details of the transportation of the material for the princess’ surgery.” Radof heard the conversation and, startled, was already preparing himself to shoot Tibor with his laser gun. But until they didn’t discover his transmutation, he could proceed with the plan. Tibor decided to warn Merko, and he said: “I imagine he may have transmuted into any employee of the hospital. Do you have infrared glasses of recognition?” “Yes, Commander Merko. I never get out without my equipment.” “So put them, I will do the same.” Tibor immediately put on his glasses and looked at Radof, whom already had a laser pointed at him and Crom. “Don’t speak any word or you will be disintegrated. Keep walking calmly as if nothing had happened. I want you to leave me at the entrance of the surgery room where the princess is.” “We need to create a plan to neutralize him without damaging the donor’s material.” He communicated telepathically with Crom. “Be calm, we’ll think of some way out.” Before they could think of anything else, Merko materialized behind Radof and hit his neck, taking the laser gun and leaving him passed out. “Get the donated material carefully. I received a strange communication from Counselor Mirov about his assistant saying he would come to the operating room, asking me to protect him. But he was taking too long to appear. In addition, the surgeon who operated Nicolas told me he hadn’t called the nurse yet and asked me if I was the one who had called him. And the material was already going into the other room; I imagined that there would be the crime scene and I now see that I was right.” He removed Radof’s glasses and he assumed his normal appearance. “Thanks, Merko. For a moment I thought it would be my end.” “That’s what friends are for. Crom, take the material to the princess’ room immediately. Tibor, arrest this man. After the end of the surgical procedures, I’ll settle up the score with Counselor Mirov.” *** Mirov was afflicted and walked from one side to the other. “Why is my incompetent servant taking so long? He’s not even informing me the facts.” Mirov decided to contact Merko to try to get some information. “Commander Merko, is everything going well in the earthling’s surgery?” “Yes sir, Counselor Mirov. In a while, I’ll personally explain the details of the operation for you. Wait for me.” “I’ll call the captain of the royal guard, Fizard. He’s also in my team. I promised him the post of commander of planetary troops when I’m the new monarch, and now I need to ask for his support.” Mirov thought. “Captain, something happened to my servant, Radof, because he doesn’t communicate with me.” Mirov told captain Fizard. “I want you to discover and report to me how things are in the hospital. Don’t forget that you will be my commander when I’m the new king.” “If something goes wrong with the original plan, I’ll try to harm the girl’s recovery after surgery. Maybe a poison... I need to find an alternative.” Mirov thought. *** Meanwhile, Zara was worried in one of the waiting rooms of the hospital. She tried to communicate with everyone, but they asked her to wait, because they were committed to preserve the safety of Nicolas and the Princess. Sivoc didn’t want her to be bored because of her pregnancy and wanted her to wait until the end of surgery. “I do not understand why so many secrets. Is something serious happening? But Sivoc knows what he does. I’ll keep waiting for more information. I must remain calm!” She thought, as she tried to keep her emotions under control.",

      "title": "– XVIII. Mirov’s Escape –",
      "content": "– XVIII. Mirov’s Escape – Once again, Drako had recorded the entire conversation with his robot-bird. The evidence against Mirov began to accumulate. “Commander Sivoc, we managed to intercept another communication between Mirov and captain Fizard. They are planning to harm the princess and take the power. I have the recordings here with me.” Drako said. “Thank you, Drako. Great work. I knew that Counselor Mirov had someone else collaborating with his plan. Fizard? I believed he was a good man, but I see he’s ambitious.” Sivoc immediately delivered the recording to Counselor Kenan and they took it to the king Zador II. “How can it be? I know Mirov for so many years and believed in his loyalty. Now I understand that the suggestion to send a second ship for the mission was part of his interest in harming the success of the surgery. He wanted to, somehow, intervene with dark purposes.” “Yes, your majesty. His will to take power and harm the princess was the heart of all the confusion created on planet Earth and orchestrated by the Counselor Mirov.” The king, furious, ordered to arrest Mirov and the captain Fizard, who had prepared an escape if the counselor was arrested. *** A friend of Radof, Croiff, who worked in the royal service, heard the conversation between the king and the Counselor Kenan, so he knew about the order to arrest Counselor Mirov and the captain Fizard. He immediately warned them. Without hesitating, Mirov used one of the secret exits of the palace to try to escape. Beneath the floor of the royal file room, there was a trap door where a staircase led to a tunnel that trespassed the entire palace and the capital, and led to a forest on the north side of the planet. Mirov found the escape route as a kid and used to play hide and seek with the brothers of the king Zador II. There was a picture on the wall with a portrait of the father of King Zador II, King Zador I, and the button that opened the trapdoor was located in his right eye. The place where he arrived was called Mutant Forest, because the plants, trees and animals that lived there suffered mutations that turned them into murderous vegetation. All the results of genetic experiments, which were unsuccessful, were sent there, because it was not allowed to kill living beings on the planet, even if they were consequences of such experiences. Few people managed to escape from this place. “It was very easy to escape. Few people know this escape route.” Mirov thought. “This forest is very dangerous. I have to be careful. But what about the captain Fizard? Where is he? I need get in touch with him to take me to a safer place.” Suddenly, a dark shadow covered him and he looked above, terrified. A teleporting red ray hit him and when he noticed, he was inside a cell in Merko’s ship. “Where did you intend to go, sir?” Asked the commander. “You came to the place where I like to train my soldiers: the Mutant Forest. I know all the palace’s routes of escape and put my men to search for you in all of them as soon as I learned about your escape. Consider yourself a prisoner of the King Zador II. You’ll be judged for betrayal and will certainly rot in prison.” “You, Merko, work for me and has no right to arrest me.” “Mr. Mirov, I must warn you that from now on you lost your job as counselor. Consider yourself arrested by the royal guard. You and your servant, Radof, will be imprisoned in the building of the Penitentiary of Custody and Rehabilitation. I believe you already know it, but just to remind you that the cells are protected with laser beams and it’s impossible to escape. You’ll pay, Mirov, for having conspired against the king Zador II.” *** Captain Fizard, saw movement in the royal palace, and fled as far as possible, helped by some military friends. He intended to stay hidden until things settle down in the kingdom of Zador II. For this, he gathered some men he trusted and decided to create a small army of renegades within the Mutant Forest, in Sector 13. Merko himself had trained them and he knew very well the ways to survive in that jungle. Captain Fizard and his men reached the desired point within the Mutant Forest with his escape ship. Bionic robots, half human and half machine looked above seeing the arrival of the new residents who fled and rushed to attack them. “Captain, I see some points moving in our pursuit in the holographic radar.” He warned the pilot of the ship to escape. “Will it be Merko and his men?” “I don’t believe so, certainly they are still working on the capture of Counselor Mirov. He is the primary target. Analyze the coordinates of the objects that are in motion and show me in the main screen.” Fizard could see five killers’ beings pursuing their ship. He focused them and realized they were monstrous. One of them jumped up and grabbed the ship, destabilizing it. “Prepare the ship’s shield of protection and create a field of sound waves to drive them away.” Ordered the captain to Dargan, a soldier trained by Merko who has joined the fugitive. Once the field of sound waves was turned on, the creature fell off the ship putting its hands over its ears, trying to protect itself from the deafening vibrations. “Lord, can I eliminate them with the laser beams of the ship?” Asked Dargan. “It won’t be necessary. The vibratory sound field is enough. They’ll take long time to recover. Maybe they can be useful in the future.” Deep in the forest, there was a military base built underneath the ground, with three floors, which was abandoned. There, the captain Fizard and seven trained soldiers who had fled with him were settled. They were waiting for an opportunity to return to their families. For now, they needed to wait. What mattered now was survival. *** When Merko returned from his mission, Sivoc came to him and asked: “Merko, did you managed to capture Captain Fizard or have any clue that may lead us to him?” “No, Sivoc. Probably he and his cronies fled to the worst part of the Mutant Forest, where I trained them. We can’t find them, because I was the one who taught them to survive and hide in that barren place. However, we can consider that the fugitives are already stuck where they are. It is not easy to survive there and they’ll go through some bad times. We can go after them when everything is calmer here. Now we need to focus on the main purpose, which is to save the princess.” “Let’s check if everything went well with Nicolas and Isadora.” “No doubt. I have many reasons for wanting them both to be well.” Answered Merko following Sivoc to Nicolas’ room.",

      "content": "– XIX. The Success of the Surgery – After a few weeks, the Princess Isadora began to regain her health, and the doctors protected her from any contact, until her immune system was fully restored. It seemed that the surgery had been a success and that the princess was safe. Nicolas also recovered from his surgery, and Zara went to visit him in the hospital. When she entered his room, Zara asked the nurses to leave them alone. As she was a doctor, they all agreed. There were still a few guards in the corridor to protect him and fulfill the promise of the King to get him safely to Earth. Mirov and Radof have been arrested, but the captain Fizard was still missing and was considered a threat. Although he was a bit weak, he touched Zara’s face. She approached and kissed him. “How’s the princess?” He asked. “Did we succeed?” “Yes. Thanks to you, she is safe and sound. Thank you, my dear, for coming here to do good for a girl you didn’t know.” “I’m very glad that everything went well. I’d do it for anyone, especially for a sick girl and to attend your request. What about our daughter? Is she okay? And you?” “We’re good. I decided to take you personally to Earth. After arriving there, I’ll find an excuse for us to be together forever. I’ll say goodbye to my relatives here on planet Vida, but I want to come back some day to visit them. Our daughter will be born on your planet. If she is born here, they’ll find out that you are the father and I’ll be punished. Counselor Kenan will help us because he planned everything and knew the risks. My belly still can’t be seen and I gained a little weight to disguise. Did you notice?” She turned aside so Nicolas could look at her. He examined her completely and said: “I love you anyway. You are the most beautiful mother of this planet and of the Earth. I’ll take care of you every day and I’ll be a great dad. I promise!” His life made sense now, and the passion for Zara added to his parental love filled his heart. *** After another week, they were greeted at the Royal Palace with a feast provided by the king and his daughter. Zador II was happy with the recovery of Isadora and could make plans to his reign and his daughter’s again. Merko met Nicolas at the party: “Young earthling, how are you? You recovered very well from surgery, as I see.” “I’m fine, Mr. Commander. The surgery was a success and it wasn’t necessary to kidnap me from Sivoc’s team. Besides, they are far more polite than you.” Nicolas replied, still angry at Merko’s methods. “I’m sorry, young man. I have this military way of being and I will try to improve my attitude. I hope you forgive me.” He replied. “What about the people you killed in your missions? Will you also apologize to their families?” Nicolas asked. “In war, it is “do or die”. I am trained for defense and attack, but I’m retiring. You don’t need to worry about it. But... I need to tell you a secret.” “A secret?” Nicolas was quite curious. “You can talk, sir. I’m listening.” “I met your mother, Lorena, during one of my missions on Earth and we had a relationship during this period. This happened 23 years ago. And...” “What are you trying to say with this? You look nervous.” Nicolas interrupted. “I am your father. Ok, I said!” The two became silent for a moment, and the boy simply didn’t believe. “That’s impossible.” He thought. “Your lymphocytes X are the result of the interbreeding of our genes.” Merko began to explain. “There was a recombination between the future and the past. Your chain of DNA is the same as mine. I discovered it during his surgery, because I know very well my chromosomal strain of defense cells and, when I saw them in the holography, I could be sure that it’s identical to yours.” “I...” The earthling was speechless before such revelation. “This also explains the telekinesis. I saw personally when you used your power in my ship, Nicolas. Let me take you to a place on the planet Vida where I can show you something very interesting.” Merko held Nicolas’ watch with his left hand, and with the right he synchronized the teleport with his own watch. “You press the button of your watch, son. Can I call you like this?” It still sounded a bit strange to Nicolas to hear Merko calling him this way. He didn’t answer the question, but pressed the button curious. Then, father and son reached a distant place from the capital. Nicolas looked around and there was nobody there, only a forest with few trees and plants. Merko climbed next to a mountain. The boy was worried and didn’t know what to expect from that man who seemed to be mysterious; whose reputation and past actions didn’t make him reliable. Then, Merko raised his hands slightly pointing to the sky and pulled the cosmic energy, directing it to the mountain. Nicolas was amazed watching a ray of blue colorcast by his father, who blew up a portion of the top of the mountain with more than one meter of diameter with tremendous force. Witnessing Merko’s power, the boy could feel that all the things said about the commander were true. “Did you understand what the telekinetic energy is and why you own it? We can control the cosmic energy, move objects and control the gravitational fields around them. I’ll teach you to use this strength and dominate it.” Merko said, approaching to Nicolas. “Can I give you a hug, son? As a father...” “No problem, although I feel confused about it. I thought my father was...” Merko and the earthling hugged each other for a few minutes in a deep and touching silence. The father felt a new emotion, a feeling of having done something good in his life, and Nicolas felt protected by a strong father and a figure he had never known. Merko omitted the circumstances of how he met Lorena, because Nicolas would never understand his means to achieve the objectives of the mission. “I’d like to see your mother again. I’ve never felt something so true for a person as I felt for her.” “She lives with my sister. But I don’t think she’ll be interested in you, especially after so many years. And you are an alien!” Nicolas answered. “We’ll see. You know I can turn myself into the earthling I want. About being alien, you know I’m a human from the future and you’re also a hybrid of a human from the past with one from the future, I mean, you are also half alien. But it seems to me that I have a jealous son.” Merko and Nicolas became good friends, and when he knew about Nicolas’ return to the planet Earth with Zara, he decided to help, escorting them. However, what he really wanted was to see Lorena again and remember the best moments with a woman in his life. He also wanted to stay on the planet Earth, conquer the woman of his life and try to be happy with her. *** On the day of Nicolas’ departure, again the king insisted on having a party in tribute to their heroes. Merko and Zara, as a request of Kenan, were chosen to escort the earthling back to Earth. The palace was adorned with the most beautiful flowers of the season, and the guests came from the uttermost parts of the planet Vida. The food was plentiful and tasty, prepared by the great masters of the royal cooking. Princess Isadora was smiling and happy to have her health back and to live like a normal child. She was very grateful to the earthling who had given her what was most precious in her life: health. The king Zador II gifted Nicolas with a ring of communication by high power radio, so he could ask for help if he ever needed. A channel would be opened so they could talk and they’d be able keep their friendship. Nobody imagined that Merko and Zara were planning to stay there and live as ordinary human beings. However, Sivoc, Tibor and Drako suspected that maybe they’d never see them again. It was a good chance for the two extraterrestrial beings to travel and remain on the planet that once had belonged to their ancestors. Sivoc, instead of communicating the fact to the Council, preferred to keep the secret with his team, in which he really trusted. When he returned to Earth, in any other mission, if possible, he certainly would visit them, for old times’ sake. Everyone on the planet treated them as heroes for saving the life of Princess Isadora. After the party, they said goodbye. Sivoc, Drako and Tibor hugged Zara and Nicolas for a long time. The doctor cried and told everyone that she would miss the missions that her team performed on other planets. Nicolas thanked his new friends for the protection on the planet Earth and also on planet Vida, during his surgery. Tibor approached Merko, shook his hand and said: “Take good care of the earthling and Zara. Maybe one day we’ll visit you on your new planet. We are always here if you need some help.” “I’d like to execute some mission by your side, Tibor. Everyone always told me a lot of good things about you, and certainly we would succeed if we work together. But now I’m retiring to take care of my new family. Don’t worry! You have a friend now.” Merko shook hands with Sivoc and Drako. The king and the princess thanked Nicolas again for his help. Kenan took Nicolas’ and Zara’s hands and blessed them, saying: “I trusted you with this mission knowing that the doctor was competent. Take the earthling safely and protect him so he won’t be in danger on his planet. Keep our secret well and Merko will also protect you. Hope to see you soon.” They all accompanied them to the ship Challenge I and, with sad eyes, they finally saw the ship take off, knowing that they would miss them. They traveled with Merko’s ship, entering the space-time gap, and returned to Earth.",

      "content": "– XX. Back to Earth – When they arrived on the planet Earth, Merko entered the deepest part of the sea, by the side of the Pacific Ocean, since members of the Alpha-Omega team were monitoring the Atlantic side. The aliens hid the ship. “Z8, put the ship in a latent state.” Merko ordered the ship’s computer. “Confirm if the robot satellites are in orbit on the planet and put them in the invisible module. Keep the contacts with the planet Vida and contact us if necessary.” “Yes sir, Commander Merko. All actions had been executed.” Said a computer’s female voice. They teleported to Los Angeles and materialized in the Chinatown’s subway. Merko put his glasses and chose to become a man about 48 years old, dark brown eyes, broad shoulders, strong physique, 6’1”, the male type that Lorena dreamed of finding. Zara returned to be the beautiful woman who charmed Nicolas on their first meeting and the earthling returned to his normal form. Together they entered the train as normal humans, but even Nicolas, who now knew he was a hybrid, between human beings from the past and from the future, already felt like an “alien”. “Nicolas, would you mind if I came to see your mother?” Asked Merko. “Obviously not. If I want to marry an alien, why couldn’t my mother do the same? Especially now that I am also an alien.” He answered. “Since my own son is giving me his permission, I’ll date your mother again.” “Will she accept? You are very self-confident.” “I will do everything possible.” *** Merko and Zara went to a hotel in Los Angeles. Until they found a definitive place to live they would be staying at that hotel, not far from Nicolas’ house. Everything was new to them; the people, the home, the new planet and they needed some time to adapt themselves. When they returned to planet Earth, they timed their return to the approximate point of Nicolas’ disappearance, as they had agreed. This would improve the chances of a return to normalcy in his life. So Nicolas came back shortly after his disappearance and many problems that occurred after his departure, like Lorena and his sister’s concern would be abbreviated with his arrival, preventing his mother to warn the police and receiving the message. Besides, it would also be good to make the biggest traces of extraterrestrial presence on Earth disappear, like what happened in Central Park and at the gym, so that the attention of the Alpha-Omega team wouldn’t be so close. Nicolas said goodbye to them and went home, he needed to meet his family again. He missed his mother and his sister very much and seeing them was what he wanted. He knew that the two of them should be worried about him and he just wanted to show them that there was no reason for concern. He put his hands in his pocket and didn’t find his keys. He had probably lost them. So, he went toward the house and knocked on the door. Lorena promptly opened it and froze when she saw her son, who she feared she had lost. She began to weep and embraced him. “My dear son, where have you been during this time? It doesn’t matter! I just want to hug you, feel you.” Tears ran down through Lorena’s cheeks, which showed a big relief to finally have her son back. “Mother, I’m sorry for not giving news in the recent days. Don’t cry, it wasn’t that long.” “My son, for a mother every second is precious. And you have always been very responsible; you had never done anything like this before. I was very concerned about the lack of news and feared the worst.” “Calm down, now I’m back, safe and sound.” “Why did you disappear, my son? Why did you leave me so worried? “I met a woman and had to travel to help her solve a problem. Forgive me for not warning you. There was a sick person in her family, and we had to find an effective treatment as soon as possible to save her. It was a seven year-old girl named Isadora.” “A seven years old girl? How is she? Is she better?” Asked Lorena showing concern. “Don’t worry, mom. The girl is healed and all the effort we made to help her had a great result. She is well and happy. We were very pleased to be able to save her.” Lorena smiled with satisfaction, realizing that the education she had given to her son turned him into a good man. She couldn’t hold back the flood of tears and cried desperately, giving a tight hug in her firstborn. At first, the boy was frightened by his mother’s attitude, but soon understood and hugged her, filling her with kisses and caressing her for the first time since he had left her without news and worried. At this moment, Sophia, who had just heard her brother’s voice, came running to meet him. She jumped on his neck, embraced and kissed him, saying: “My brother, you’re back. I love you! I missed you so much!” “I love you.” Nicolas replied and was so thrilled that his voice was choked. He embraced his sister and mother in a triple hug. He also missed that he spent many months away from those whom he loved so much. Even if they missed him only for some days, for him it had been months. He needed that comforting hug. “Next time, my son, that you need to travel and solve some problems, please let us knows so that we won’t be suffering without news. We are a family. We can’t stay apart. And it doesn’t cost anything, isn’t it?” “I’m sorry, mom. And I promise I won’t do that anymore. However, I have good news.” “I bet it’s related to that woman you mentioned, isn’t it?” “Does Nicolas have a girlfriend?” Asked a curious Sophia. “The two are right. I have a girlfriend and I am very happy with Zara. Soon I’ll introduce her for you two. The three women in my life need to meet and I’m sure you’ll be good friends.” Mother and daughter were curious to know the woman who conquered Nicolas’ heart. They knew he was a good man, but he had no luck with women and they hoped that this time he had found a good partner. He certainly deserved it. That was a wonderful evening with the family together again. There were endless conversations over dinner, prepared by Lorena especially for her son; with the food he liked the most. They talked about everything, but the subject always came back to Zara. They were all anxious for that meeting. *** Nicolas wanted to take Zara to meet his mother and Sophia one week after his return. The boy asked his mother to prepare a dinner, so he would invite his girlfriend to meet the family. Lorena was a great cook and prepared a delicious duck with orange and roasted potatoes washed down by Port wine. Sophia and her mother waited anxious to know the one that had conquered Nicolas’ heart. The doorbell rang and Sophia ran to the door to answer it. “It must be her.” Said the reckless girl. “Take it easy, darling. Let Nick welcome her. After all, she’s his girlfriend.” Lorena challenged. “Okay, Mom. Let me open it.” Said the boy already heading to the door. Nicolas received Zara, which looked lovely. She wore jeans and a red shirt, which despite being simple was elegant. He kissed her mouth lightly and hugged her. Then he took her hand and, realizing that she was nervous about meeting her new family, he led her gently towards his mother. “Zara, this is my mother.” “Nice to meet you, Zara. I’m glad to know you. I see you’ve been making my son very happy.” The beauty of her daughter in law enchanted Lorena. “The pleasure is all mine. In fact, is your son who makes me happy.” “This is Sophia, my sister. Isn’t she beautiful?” “I think she’s much prettier than you said, Nick.” Sophia blushed and hugged Zara. She smiled at her, somewhat embarrassed. She was very happy to meet her sister in law. “My brother has good taste and knew how to choose a beautiful girlfriend.” “Your family is very friendly, Nick. I hope they like me.” “I love you, Zara. And I want you to be part of my family. Do you all agree?” “It’ll be a pleasure.” Lorena replied. Sophia just moved her head as a sign of approval. The dinner was magnificent! The three women get along very well and Zara already seemed to be part of the family. She praised Lorena’s food and took some time to talk to Sophia, who showed her room and some of her projects in school. At the end of the night, Nicolas and Zara went to his room to talk a bit and make plans for their new life. *** One day, when Lorena was on the way to her work as a hairdresser, Merko allowed himself to bump into her, knocking the purse of the beautiful woman down. He calmly picked it up and said: “Please, excuse me. I was nervous when I saw you, because I think you have a beauty from another planet.” She smiled at his words and they began a long conversation. Merko suggested they met at night to get to know each other, and Lorraine promptly accepted. She was glad to see her son, Nicolas, and meet her daughter in law. Now, what still missed, to complete her life, was a man who loved and protected her. It was quite providential to find such a classy and gentle man on the way to work. Of course she would accept to go out with him and hoped it was a wonderful evening. At night, Merko picked Lorena at her home. She had given her address after the long conversation they had on their cell phones during the afternoon. She looked stunning in a black dress with a neckline. She was even more beautiful than Merko remembered. For their first date, Merko searched enough on the Internet and even got tips from Nicolas and Zara. Everything had to be perfect and he chose a very elegant restaurant to take that one he already knew to be the woman of his life. “Is your name Merko? It’s a different name! What about your last name? You haven’t told me what it is.” Lorena said while they waited for the order they had made to the waiter, tasting a delicious wine. “It’s Merko Silion.” Suddenly he answered deciding to use the friend’s name to honor him. ‘Lorena, you look beautiful tonight! I’m glad you agreed to go out with me.” Merko changed the subject, because he couldn’t reveal too much of his personal life. The two of them took the opportunity to enjoy the great food while they chatted about amenities. They talked about their musical tastes, movies and even a little bit of their personal lives. Merko used all his charm to conquer the beautiful women. The conversation was so good, that after finishing the meal they didn’t want to leave. They headed to a square near the restaurant where they could spend a little more time together. Both enjoyed each other’s company a lot and didn’t want to say goodbye. Sitting on a bench at that square, they watched people passing by, the beautiful flowers of the season in the top of the trees and exchanged significant glances. Merko touched her right hand. Since she didn’t move, he held her gently. He looked at Lorena and, not resisting her full lips, he promptly kissed her, feeling sensations that his life would become very special from that moment. The couple completed each other and enjoyed that unique moment of extreme happiness. Merko kept many secrets in his mind that, if revealed, they would obviously destroy those magical moments. But it wasn’t the time to think about how he would reveal his life to Lorena. It was necessary to enjoy the chemistry that existed between them. *** At the Pentagon, the chief Ronald Steighen and the agents Netil and Soliver were gathered to review all the evidence they had collected from the alien presence on the planet. They didn’t find a concrete conclusion; however, they made a report with all the information gathered during the investigation. They would keep their eyes open, waiting for some opportunity to capture, with the help of security forces, aliens from other planets, their ships and weapons. *** Dither, the editor, asked his journalist, Thomas, to discover why the government was protecting so much the information about the presence of aliens on Earth. An informant from the Air Force told the editor about the episode of the invasion of the Earth’s airspace by UFOs. He learned that two alien’s spaceships were detected by the radars of the Multinational Space Station and then disappeared without explanation. Probably, there were aliens on our planet. The journalist waited for more evidence of the extraterrestrial presence here on Earth in order to give the news that would shake the way that humans saw the world. *** Zara, Nicolas and Merko vowed to keep their identities in secret and managed to live like normal people. Merko opened a company of security values and personal protection. He worked during the day and at night went to Lorena’s house to date her. She thought about him as protective man and imagined he had appeared in her life to complete all her dreams as a woman. He was actually the other half that would complete her, the one that would protect her for the rest of her life. A man transformed by the power of love. *** After all the adventures he lived, it was time for Nicolas to go back to his studies in physics. When he returned to college, he met Sanchez. “Where have you been, Nicolas?” Sanchez asked when he saw his friend. “We missed you. You have a lot to catch up on. During this time you were absent, a lot of things was thought to us, the students. Coincidentally, Zara didn’t show up at college. What a strange thing!” “If I told you everything I’ve been through during this period, you wouldn’t believe.” Replied the boy with a mysterious air. “But let’s say I made an important trip to meet new people from other places.” “I didn’t understand what you mean by that.” Sanchez said confusing. “Okay. Maybe someday I’ll explain it to you better.” While they talked in the middle of the courtyard of the college, few students from the same course, including George and Adam, came closer to him. “Nicolas, you are here? You disappeared. What happened? Did you have any psychic outbreak?” Adam asked with a sarcastic tone. “Let’s say I took a time to relax my mind.” He answered without getting embarrassed with the mean comment. That was when the beautiful Zara came walking toward them with her heavenly blue eyes and a beautiful silhouette, which the pregnancy hasn’t been able to modify yet. Everyone on the campus stared at her as she walked toward Nicolas. She kissed him on the lips and said: “Nick, my dear... Do you want to introduce me to your friends? I study in this college, but it seems that you’re the only one I know.” “Of course, my love.” He said, proudly. “This is Zara.” He turned to those who had mocked him minutes before, to introduce his girlfriend. He had a smile, and the happiness was stamped in his face. “She is a new student who came transferred from another university from the East Coast. Do you remember her? She entered our university little time ago to study physics there. We’re together.” Everyone was perplexed and amazed by the lucky of the boy they teased so much in college for being weird and unable to captivate any girl. “What did you see in him, Zara?” George wanted to know. “Let’s say I can read his mind, so I know things about him that no one else is able to know.” Zara replied with half a smile. “Come on, Nick, we need to have dinner together tonight. You promised me a romantic dinner, remember?” And they were all amazed watching the two lovers leaving embraced. Sanchez looked at the couple and thought: Now I understand why Nicolas disappeared during this time with the new student. They know how to enjoy life! *** At night, Nicolas and Zara got out for the highly anticipated romantic dinner and chose an Italian restaurant where she really enjoyed the food. Her pregnancy made her insatiably hungry, although it was still very early. “Zara, what name will we choose for our daughter?” The boy took the opportunity to talk about the baby. “I’d like we called her Helen. It is a strong name. What do you think?” “I like this name. It’s certainly beautiful like her mother. We’ll do everything to make her a happy girl.” She smiled feeling the happiness in the glance of her love, and read in his mind the desire to take care of the daughter who was in her womb. “My love, we need to tell your mother about my pregnancy. We can’t wait too long or she will discover by herself and may be disappointed because we didn’t reveal the truth.” “We’ll tell her next weekend. We’ve already scheduled that picnic and I think it will be the ideal moment to tell about our little Helen. I’m sure that both my mother and my sister will be happy to hear the news.” “It will really be a perfect time!” The rest of the night was really enjoyed by the couple, who now lived romantic moments, with a lot of passion, involved in total harmony. *** Zara changed to medical school after making some tests and proving to be capable. She soon stood out as a student, with great grades, but she couldn’t go beyond what would seem ordinary to the eyes of other students or teachers. Her desire was to specialize in Genetics to be able to return to practice her profession according to the law on the planet Earth. Those feelings of anxiety that she once felt were now so rare, that she didn’t mentioned them anymore. Maybe it was the fruit of the passion she felt for Nicolas and also the joy of being a mother. The boy noticed that Zara was better from those symptoms of anxiety and avoided talking about it. Soon she would have to take a leave from college because of pregnancy. The doctor’s belly was slowly growing but her pregnancy was healthy. Nicolas noticed that she was eating well when they went out for dinner or for a snack, but he tried to make her feel comfortable. *** Merko and Lorena went out a lot and everything was quite new to him, because the habits of fun and the rides were quite different from what he was accustomed to do on the planet Vida. When he saw police cars passing by and heard telepathically the communications about crimes, he felt an almost irresistible urge to chase criminals. Then, he calmed himself down and thought he shouldn’t get involved in the problems. He turned to the woman he loved and they had fun, as a happy couple. *** On the planet Vida, everything seemed to be normal after the arrest of the villain Mirov. However, even arrested he stayed walking from one side to the other in his cell, thinking of a way to escape. His servant, Radof, was nervous in the next cell and, one day, he asked: “Master, why are you so anxious?” “Shut up, Radof. I need to think of a way to get out of here. Where is Captain Fizard? He cowardly hid himself; when, in fact, he’s our only chance to escape.” “I don’t understand what you’re saying, master. You can’t escape.” “Be quiet. Let me think.” Mirov continued his eternal walk in the space where he was imprisoned, articulating a Machiavellian plan to escape from there and, with it, be able get revenge from his enemies. *** Meanwhile, on Earth, Nicolas and Zara were already thinking about the possibility of living together, because it would be the natural consequence of their relationship, especially now, with the arrival of the girl who would change their lives.",

      "content": "– XXI. The Wedding – Earth – Year 2017 After so many adventures, Nicolas and Zara only wanted to live a normal life, enjoy their romance and the daughter who would soon be born. They were living in a house on the outskirts of Los Angeles, not far from Lorena, because they wanted to keep living near her. Nicolas went back to study Physics was a bright student, very interested in cosmology and the curvature of space-time, which would allow time travel in the future. Zara continued to study medicine until her due date. Lorena insisted that the two lovers should marry in a church, but her son didn’t care for it and neither did Zara. Marriage on her old planet was very simple. Merko didn’t want to interfere because he didn’t even know what was like a weeding in a church. But since Nicolas’ mother kept asking them both for a traditional ceremony and they were already living together they decided to do it. *** The boy went to a jewelry store and bought a pair of gold wedding rings. Since he would marry Zara in a few weeks, according to his mother’s desire, he would like to give his fiancée a perfect gem. For the occasion more than special he invited his beloved for a dinner with candles at a restaurant on Melrose Avenue. The place was specialized for couple’s celebrations, especially at night, because there was a dim light over the tables, which provided a romantic atmosphere. A large chandelier of crystals was positioned in the middle of the hall and a vase with red flowers was neatly placed on each table. Two violinists played soft songs. Nicolas wore black pants, white shirt and a dark brown blazer. His shoes were black and polished. Zara wore an indigo blue dress reaching her knees with a white shoe. “Zara, do you want to marry a simple Earthman?” Nicolas asked after kneeling in front of her with a small velvet box in his hands. “Of course I do.” She was visibly touched. “I want to marry the most handsome man on this planet.” He put a beautiful engagement ring on her finger and she did the same. Nicolas touched her face and pulled her down for a tender kiss. Tears began to fall down her face. Tears of joy, representing her happiness to live and experience the great love she felt for Nicolas. *** They choose a temple in Salt Lake for the wedding ceremony. The place was one of the most beautiful chapels in the city with several coconut trees adorning the side road to the church. This one had been recently renovated and was painted yellow outside contrasting with the columns painted in white. The inner walls had light beige coating, alternating with other colors in a slightly darker beige color. Statues of saints over pedestals were standing behind the pulpits. White flowers behind the altar provided an air of peace with the help of the angels. Lorena was in charge of the preparations and went to the best shops in Los Angeles to choose the dress with Zara. They spent hours on the search. Finally, the doctor decided for a white dress with pearls around her collar and crystals that were shining softly on the light. Lorena and Sophia didn’t seem able to talk about other thing and Zara was also so happy, surrounded by the atmosphere. The women prepared the clothes, the party and enjoyed the good fortune that a wedding brings. The long-awaited day finally arrived. The guests were anxious to enter the church and everyone wanted to see the arrival of the bride. Sanchez was among the guests, along with college students, teachers and all of the family’s friends. Almost all the men were dressed in suits and the women wore long dresses, each one more beautiful than the other. White and yellow flowers were placed around the main hall, and Nicolas could see that some of flowers were jasmine. Seven young people were behind the altar of the church with their violins, cellos and piano. The godparents positioned themselves side by side in the first three rows of the church where they were standing awaiting the arrival of the bride. The maestro sang the song “Ave Maria” by Johann Sebastian Bach and Charles Gounod, which was wonderful in the ears of all people that attended the ceremony. The groom felt the scent of jasmine and waited for his lover beside his mother. The bridesmaid and groomsmen started to walk and everyone was just paying attention to them. The music stopped for a few seconds and an absolute silence filled the room. It was the anticipation of the arrival of the bride. Nicolas was anxious and stared at the doorway of the church waiting for Zara. Lorena was at his side with a light pink dress with a strap on the left shoulder and white shoes. Seeing that tears were flowing from her eyes, Nicolas took a handkerchief from his jacket pocket and gave her. Sophia entered when the music began to play, sung by a chorus of voices of the singers who were standing on a mezzanine. She wore a white dress and a small wreath, and threw petals of red flowers on the way through which the bride would pass. The musicians started to play the wedding march by Mendelssohn. Merko entered the temple arm in arm with Zara, who wore her beautiful white dress with veil and bouquet of flowers on her hand. She smiled happily at Nicolas. Merko wore a black suit with a light blue shirt and gray tie with black stripes. He would prefer to use military clothing, but the suit made him feel important in the middle of all these people. Zara looked and smiled to everyone on the left and the right side of the hall and realized that at that time she was the center of attention. She was grinning happily and showing them her joy and fulfillment. As she walked, she thanked everyone’s presence with a nod, beaming and saying: “Thank you.” Her eyes showed all the emotion she was feeling when walking towards the altar. Nicolas was holding Lorena arm on the left side of the altar. Lorena’s smile was incessant and she let her son go when Zara arrived. He hugged Merko, that after kissing the bride on her cheek he went to stand by Lorena on the right side of the altar. The groom finally and tenderly kissed Zara’s forehead. Lorena was thrilled, almost crying with the whole scene. Merko was nervous not knowing what to do and was just staying close to Lorena. He gave her his arm and she leaned on him, proud to be with her husband at that moment. Sophia was standing in the front row and felt that from that moment on she had gained a sister, whom she considered beautiful and she knew she was going to be a good friend and a counselor. The girl was very happy to be part of the first wedding in the family, which looked just like a fairy tale. Bride and groom were positioned on the altar and stared at each other lovingly, like there was no one around them. The priest asked everyone to join him in a prayer and bless the couple when they were confessing their love for each other. The altar boy held the Bible while the priest proceeded with ceremony. He told Nicolas to repeat after him and he was so nervous and anxious that he had problems to follow the simple instructions. Zara also repeated the words of love and loyalty that brought hope and joy to her heart. The ceremony was very beautiful and everyone was so happy for the young couple. Everywhere in the church you could see someone wiping some tears. Unmarried women waited anxious for the moment when the bride would throw the bouquet, which, according to tradition, would give luck to the one who got it. It was the time for the rings, and another bridesmaid entered the hall carrying it on a small white satin pillow embroidered with lace. Step by step, everyone watched the little girl who was now the center of attention. Upon reaching the altar, she gently handed to the couple the symbol of their union. After hearing the words of the priest, the couple exchanged the rings and shared a passionate kiss. Now they were married according to the laws of men from the planet Earth. When they left the church, Zara turned her back, and the women anxiously waited for the bouquet. She counted until to three and threw it. A college friend from the university got the flowers and smiled with the luck that the tradition promised her. A limousine was waiting for the couple while the guests threw rice grains on the bride and groom, which represent abundance. Everything had been planned by Lorena to provide an air of beauty and perfect joy. *** After the wedding, there was a party at a club in the region. It was a wonderful place with a lake surrounded by green grass, full of white swans. A white bridge passed over the lake and made the place even more magical. At night the light of the garden were accentuated by the beauty of the arrangements placed throughout the ballroom. Plenty of food and drinks were served to the while everyone was dancing to the music that was being played electronically. Then, the stage was opened and a band playing live songs surprised the guests. Everyone was shocked with the good news. The young couple had the privilege to dance the first song on the dance floor and soon many joined them dancing and celebrating their union. Sanchez walked toward Nicolas and Zara to greet them: “Congratulations, Nicolas, for this time of happiness. I could never imagine you would date a beautiful student who arrived at our college. Congratulations for you too, Zara. I wish a lot of happiness to the couple! And I ask you to take good care of my friend. He’s a special guy!” “Thanks, Sanchez. I’ll wait for your visit and I’d like you to come to my new home. One of these days, I’ll be at your wedding...” Nicolas replied smiling. “Thank you, Sanchez. Friends of my husband are my friends too.” Lorena asked the music to stop for a moment and got the microphone from the stage saying: “Let’s make a toast for the bride and the groom and their happiness!” Everyone raised their glasses of champagne and shouted aloud: “Congratulations to the new family!” Zara and Nicolas stared at each other, happy, and kissed for a few seconds in the middle of the hall. Then the audience clapped and everyone smiled happily. The party was wonderful, and everything worked according to Lorena’s plan. Now she was very happy because her son was married to a good girl. But she was wondering: Why the bride’s family did not attend the ceremony, not even one person? Merko read her mind and approaching said: “Honey, you look worried. What happened? The party is beautiful, your son is happy, there is no reason to be concerned today.” “Oh, my love, I can’t stop thinking about the reasons that prevented the girl’s family to attend the wedding.” “Lorena, we’ve already talked about this. She only has her parents. They came to America when they were both very young and lost contact with the rest of the family. They are very old and couldn’t make it to the wedding. One day we’ll go visit them and you will understand what I mean.” Merko said, hugging and kissing her. Thought if she knew Zara’s parents, she would faint with the surprise. He thought smiled. “Why are you laughing, Merko?” “It’s nothing, my love. I’m just happy for this moment and was thinking about your silly concern.” He replied, kissing her tenderly on the lips. Grabbing her by the arms, he led her to the dance floor, adding: “Come on, let’s celebrate this special day!” Merko and Lorena were on the dance floor when he affectionately touched her face with his, and whispered in her ear: “I want to enjoy this wonderful moment and ask you to marry me. Will you agree to be my wife?” He said looking directly into her eyes. “Of course I agree my love. I want to live with you forever!” Merko and Lorena decided to get married in a simple ceremony at the registry office of the city, and that he now moved to her house.",

      "title": "– XXII. Helen’s birth –",
      "content": "– XXII. Helen’s birth – After a few months passed Zara belly began to grow, and she was now eight months pregnant. The preparations for the birth of the child were being made, and everyone was anxious for Helen’s arrival. During one beautiful night Nicolas spoke with Zara on the balcony about the arrival of their baby. “Zara, do you think our daughter will be born in the human form or will she have the evolved appearance like the people from your planet?” “I have done prenatal work at our ship, while you and Merko just talked about the stars and the cosmos. I see that you always get lost on the subjects when you two are talking, and even more when he is teaching you how to fly. That’s why I have kept the details out and just said that everything is okay with our daughter. And it is true, you don’t need to worry, Helen is fine. But it’s important that we discuss the future of our daughter. Z8 showed me that the gene predominant is in his earthly form. I prefer to be in our laboratory inside the ship because I think it’s safer to her and to avoid any problem. The doctor’s in Earth would never understand if they saw a baby with alien features. I had some doubts about the genetic dominance of our races. She is hybrid like you are and she’ll also be born in the same way you did, she will be the daughter of a hybrid human and an evolved human from the future. This will facilitate her life here on earth, because she won’t have to wear transmutation glasses. She’ll need them only if she decides to become an evolved human, or maybe, someday, if we travel to planet Vida. After knowing that our daughter will have human features like everybody else here in earth, I can find a doctor to do the last prenatal tests, and help me with the final weeks of pregnancy.” “Let us choose an obstetrician as soon as possible here in Los Angeles. Your teachers should know a good medical professional to indicate us. I’m glad you made the preliminary tests in the ship.” “I’ll take a license from college stop my classes for a few months. Despite being a doctor on my planet, I need to study medicine according to the rules of this country in order to work here and get a degree in Genetics one day.” “I’m sure we will be very happy!” Nicolas said, rubbing her huge belly and kissing her on the lips.” “It looks like someone heard what you said.” Zara commented feeling Helen kicking. “This name I chose means torch or light and is derived from Greek mythology. Helen was the daughter of Zeus and Leda – a demigod. I think it is a name with a beautiful pronunciation and its history is even more beautiful!” “Have you been studying ancient history?” “I always wanted to choose the name of our daughter, so I looked for one that could express the light this girl will bring into our lives.” “I like this name and everything else that comes from you.” Nicolas kissed her belly to show his affection for his daughter. He smiled with happiness. He felt he was living moments of glory by winning a beautiful wife and a daughter, a gift that would be born from their love. *** The date of the birth approached, and Zara already felt that at any moment her bag would burst. She began to feel the pressure increasing day by day and in the last prenatal exam she was told by her doctor to take antihypertensive drugs to prevent the risk of eclampsia. The increased blood pressure could reduce the amniotic fluid, called oligohydramnios, and it also could cause fetal distress putting the baby’s life in danger. Zara knew all of this, and she and Nicolas decided that due to the proximity of the birth it would be better to be in the hospital until the time the baby was born. Lorena was in the hospital with Zara while she was preparing herself for Helen’s arrival. Nicolas also took a leave from college to be able to follow the delivery. Several 3D ultrasounds were performed to verify the position of the fetus and the girl’s heart rate was monitored to see if she responded well to medication. After a few days at the hospital it was finally time for the delivery. The future father was nervous because it was his first time. Zara was also anxious, and the personal experience of being a mother was something new and challenging for her, despite being a doctor and having seen and tracked multiple births on her planet. The obstetrician preferred to make a cesarean section due to the risks, and the couple readily agreed. The recovery would take a little longer because of the sutures, but the reduction of the risks would be worth it. Merko and Sophia were visiting them in the hospital, and Lorena remained next to the Zara. The doctor examined the pregnant woman along with the nursing staff and she was transferred to the operating room. Pre-anesthetic was done, and only after the anesthesia the father could enter the room to closely monitor the medical procedures. Nicolas put the clothes to enter the operating room and took his camera to film all the magical moments and all the details. The labor began, and Zara was half asleep under the effects of sedatives, when a cry of newborn echoed in the operating room. Helen was born. The father looked at his daughter, still bloody and bathed by the fluids from her mother’s womb, and smiled with joy. He couldn’t contain the feeling that took hold of his soul. My God, it’s not possible. Thank you for this moment. My daughter was born! Nicolas said in a prayer just in his mind. The pediatrician saw the child providing her the first care and then the nurse wrapped the baby; put her in the lap of the father who was awkwardly trying to find a best position to hold her. The mother remained in the obstetric center, waiting for the end of the C-section. Outside, the relatives were asking questions to the doctors every time someone came out of the surgery area, and they telling the good news: “A beautiful girl was born; the baby and her mother are well.” “I hope the father is well too because he was so nervous that he probably needed medical attention.” Merko said smiling. “Stop with it, honey. My son is fine and certainly is in heaven with the birth of his first daughter.” Helen received a pink bracelet, just like Zara, with the same identification code of the mother, and was taken to a recovery room and inside an incubator for 30 minutes to return to ideal body temperature. The curtain opened and the family was able to meet the baby. Soon after, the nursing staff took the first anthropometric measurements and gave the first vaccines to protect the child. Meanwhile, Zara was taken to a recovery room and remained there for an hour, after they took the baby to stay with her and start encouraging her to the first breastfeeding. The mother, seeing that her daughter had already taken her bath and smelled like a baby, was mesmerized by joy and could only smile. She was still half asleep because of the effect of the anesthesia. Then, they were taken to the room where they could receive visitors. Lorena had separate kits with clothes for the baby like diapers and socks. So, after each bath they just had to pick up and use a kit that was already prepared. She had chosen, together with Zara, girl clothes and each one was more beautiful than the other. They also had won many gifts from friends who visited them, and, mostly, they were baby clothes. “People really like to give child’s clothes as gifts. I love it!” Zara thought whenever she won them. Nicolas stayed all the time beside his wife, who was feeding the baby. He took her little one in his lap, feeling how good it was to be a father and promising to protect and care for his daughter. “What a beautiful baby!” Lorena said, seeing her granddaughter for the first time. “I brought a hot pink blanket for this adorable baby who was just born. Can I hold her a little bit?” “It is obvious that you can take her, my mother in law.” Lorena took the girl in her arms and smelled that delicious scent of baby. “What a delight to be able to hold a child in my arms again. Especially after knowing that is my granddaughter!” After some time with Helen in her arms, she asked Merko: “Honey, hold her for a moment too. Feel how good it is to have a baby in your arms.” Merko looked nervous at the child, and with shake hands got her. Lorena said: “Put her on the left arm and support her with you right hand underneath.” The girl was sleeping peacefully showing how comfortable she was on in his arms. “What a cute little thing!” Merko said. “Merko, you’re good with kids.” Nicolas said smiling. Merko smiled back enjoying that single moment which he may never have lived if he didn’t make the decision to travel back with Nicolas and Zara to the planet Earth. Then Sophia took her in her arms and was delighted since it was the first time she held up a baby. Zara looked at her with tenderness apparently she did could spend hours and hours just holding Helen. “Bath time.” Said the nurse upon entering the room. “I’ll take care of Helen and I want everyone to wait outside for a while, please.” Everyone left, while the nurse took care of the baby and put a bandage on her navel. Then she left Helen with Zara, who began to feed the baby with the precious colostrum that came with the first drops of her breast milk. After a few minutes, the family who had been having a snack in the cafeteria outside the hospital returned. “She has blue eyes like her mother.” Nicolas announced. Seeing his granddaughter, Merko understood he had made the right decision to return to planet Earth, and Zara was also happy with her love.",

      "content": "– XXIII. The Family – Earth – Year 2028 Nicolas’ family had increased since he met Zara and his father, Merko, who was transformed with his security company and now lived with Lorena and Sophia in Bel Air – in an upscale residential neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Nicolas and Zara also moved to this neighborhood, to be closer to his family. The doctor had a degree and was working on a clinic in downtown Los Angeles. Nicolas began to work in the Physics Research Center in California, also in the same city. Helen was 10 years old and had light brown hair. She liked to wear her hair braided, and when she let it loose, it got very curly. Sophia, now 18, was preparing herself to attend the Environmental Engineering Course at college, and was determined to be a great engineer. Zara always guided her in her career, which was promising, and taught her the importance of preserving ecosystems for the future of humanity. Lorena and Merko lived happily, taking care of the little Helen, while Nicolas dedicated himself to his work. Over the time Merko started to work less in his security firm. He believed it was time to enjoy life besides the people he loved. Helen excelled in school, studying many subjects and learning them easily. Zara, besides working in her clinic, also began teaching Medical Genetics and working on research projects at the same university where Nicolas worked, however, what she really liked was the genetic research; but even if she was part of some project, she couldn’t advance with innovations beyond the time in which she now lived. Her knowledge exceeded the boundaries of her time, but she should not change the chronology of scientific discoveries. Therefore, she developed projects of researches compatible with the level of development of the time she was living. She couldn’t let all her knowledge erupt in the work, because it would create a time paradox of immeasurable proportions. “Nicolas sometimes I want to move a bit with the knowledge that is far behind in Biogenetic. We are in the XXI century, and I could just show humanity the cure for many diseases such as cancer and neurological degeneration. I see people looking for the cure of these illnesses, and I could help a little, maybe just showing them the correct direction. We could save thousands of lives.” “Zara, this would go against the ethics and the laws that control the temporal space travel. Life is already complicated because of the facts that we don’t anticipate, how more complicated it will become if we change the course of history?” “How many lives we could save accelerating scientific processes? But you’re right, dear Nick. We have no right to change history. It’s already enough the effort we make to change events with our own existence.” “The important thing, Zara, is that we’re together. Our lives and our family are gifts from heaven. And we do what we like.” At this time, he touched the skin of her hand and pulled her to him, kissing her lips with everything. They remained kissing for a few minutes as if it were the first time. After hugging him Zara thought about her own family: “I miss my father and brother who are living in Vida. I’ll try to open a communication channel with them at night, to see if everything is okay.” “Don’t worry. We can go to the ship with Merko because he wants to check if everything is in order in the case of an emergency. So you can talk to your family using the ships communication’s tools. *** Some years had passed, since her arrival on planet Earth, and the longing began to tighten Zara’s heart, which kept remembering her relatives and friends from the other planet. She often spoke with the closest people she knew by the apparatus of Merko’s ship, which was still hidden. But after so many years, the conversation began to seem too distant and insufficient to placate the longing, which increased more and more. She watched the stars for hours at night and looked toward the Andromeda galaxy. During one night, someone approached her from behind and put both hands on her eyes: “Can you guess who it is?” “Of course, you fool. I could recognize these hands and this voice anywhere.” She said, putting her hands over his and smiled as she turned. “Were you watching your galaxy? The sky is very bright tonight.” “And the moon is full. I got lost in time and stay here for hours looking at the sky and missed all the life I left behind on my planet. I wonder if they are alright.” “I believe so. Merko will contact Drako and you can ask for permission to visit them in person. So we’ll know all the news.” “I like our life here on Earth. You and Helen complete me, but I would like to visit the ones I left in there.” “When Merko decided to go we’ll go with him. It will be better, because he’s an expert in interstellar navigation.” “I’ll wait anxiously for this opportunity. I hope it won’t too long, because I miss them so much.” “We could take Helen with us. She loves to talk about the stars and I’m sure it would be a huge surprise to her.” Nicolas suggested. “I don’t know. I think it’s too early for her to understand how we are different from other humans. One day we’ll have to reveal the truth, but there will be the right time and place. What about Lorena and Sophia? Do you think they should know about us?” “No...! Definitely not, they would freak out! Imagine when they see you and Merko in your real alien form? They may not accept this could destroy our family. And how will Merko explain the fact that he’s my father? It’s better to leave things as they are. If we are traveling, we can find an excuse and we can go back in time arriving here by the time we left.” “I agree with you, sweetheart. It would be wiser not to comment with Lorena and Sophia about our planet and keep our lives normal. As for Helen, one day we’ll tell her with more details and after preparing her.” “I trust you dear. Everything happens at the right time. For the good of us all.” Nicolas pulled her close to him and hugged her. Then held her hand and stood up. They went to Helen’s room and she was sleeping deep, and they went to their own room to rest and sleep. He knew he had to find a way to take her to visit her planet. He had promised some time ago that he would take her to see her beloved ones and felt she needed to see them. Zara had adapted very well to her new home. She enjoyed her work at the University and caring for her husband and daughter, Helen, but she still missed her home planet and those she had left behind. *** While Nicolas spoke with Zara at the University, Merko took Helen to school. In the back seat of the car, she asked: “Grandpa, why are you always looking at the sky at night, when you are on the balcony of your house?” “My little Helen, the most beautiful things of this world and what I love more after you and your grandmother of course are the stars!” “One of these days, will you take me to the planetarium? I’d like to know a little more of the galaxies beyond what I learn in school. I feel that something up there attracts me.” “Of course I can take you, dear.” On the following weekend, Merko fulfilled his promise and took her to the planetarium. It was a circular shaped building with a large ball at the top imitating a planet, which could be seen for almost the entire neighborhood. During the night, the building had many colored lights, projecting different shapes and bright designs including over the sphere. Tourists circulated through the ground floor, where panels showed the various exhibitions and lectures that took place there. Many schools were visiting in groups. Merko and Helen entered a video room where a teacher from the planetary gave a demonstration lesson about the origin of the universe. There were pictures on screens positioning in the four walls around them, planets and stars hanging from the ceiling above. He spoke and showed the planets and images projected on all sides. After seeing the galaxies, pictures of dinosaurs appeared, and Helen got a little scared. “Grandpa Merko, what horrible creatures! Did they really exist? How could humans live here, if these terrible animals dominated the planet?” “My granddaughter, humans appeared here thousands of years after these animals were destroyed.” “How did they disappear?” “It’s a long story. Maybe someday I’ll tell you. But today, we need to take our time to learn about the universe.” Merko replied, knowing there was a good story that would take hours to be told. “Okay. I won’t forget that you promised to tell me this story. I’m enjoying this place so much that I don’t even know where to look. The universe is wonderful!” Helen said with a look of admiration. Merko sat on a bench with her and the two of them were enjoying an ice cream when he began to tell a story about his adventures, when he needed to deflect a meteor from their planet, and Silion, his great friend, had saved him from certain death. He used the figure of a galaxies traveling hero for her to imagine how it happened. It wasn’t yet the right moment for the girl to know who her grandfather really was. So he used fictional characters. “Grandpa, your stories seem to have actually happened. I love to hear you talking about these adventures.” Suddenly she looked at the main gate and said: “Look, Grandpa, what a cool toy! Could you buy one of these toys that looked like our galaxy?” The toy consisted in eight planets, accompanied by a sun made of a material similar to acrylic, simulating our solar system. They had the colors, shapes and size characteristics of the stars and were very similar to the real ones. “We’ll buy one when we leave here.” Merko replied. They entered another room that was showing the pictures of how the planet was formed with its volcanoes. A melon was placed in a screen, split in half; its shell represented the earth’s crust, and its interior was the outer and inner garment; its center, the solid core surrounded by the outer liquid core. The speaker explained that the Earth’s core, full of metal, was responsible for the Earth’s magnetic field. Then he showed how comets can pass near the planet Earth and how they are bright and, sometimes, visible to the naked eye. The images and explanations left the girl’s eyes widened with so much attention, and her grandfather felt that sooner or later the evolved human condition would erupt in Helen and nothing would be able to prevent it. *** At night, Zara went to Helen’s room and the girl’s toys, which imitated the planets and the sun from our Orion arm, were spinning around the room, while the little one slept her deepest sleep. She seemed to smile as she slept. Zara ran down the stairs and called Nicolas and Merko to show them what had happened. “Nick, Merko! Come with me to Helen’s room and see with your own eyes.” “It is simply magnificent! Helen is, in a way, using telekinetic powers without realizing it, while sleeping.” Said Merko impressed with what he saw. “Will she be able to develop this skill if she’s awake?” Commented Nicolas, who was also amazed. “We need to teach her how to control these powers. Imagine if she does something like this close to other kids at school?” Zara completed. “This could put her in a difficult position and put her in danger.” They were worried about the safety of the girl. Now there was one more reason for maintaining the secret identities of Nicolas’ extraterrestrial family members, who lived on planet Earth. The future held many dangers they would have to face, and the union would be the best way to survive what was about to come. – The End –",

      "title": "– I. The Meeting –",
      "content": "– I. The Meeting – Year 2017 Nicolas was preparing himself for another day at the university. He took his blue backpack with black stripes, full of books, a computer and his Smartphone, in which he could always check his e-mails and text messages sent by friends from college. He drank a glass of milk and took two bites of the sandwich prepared by his mother. He was running late as usual, to get to the bus for his classes. “Nicolas, wait! I need to talk to you.” Lorena shouted, unable to reach him. She looked at the door and saw that he was already inside the bus. She thought it would be better to talk to him at night, since he rarely sat at the table to have breakfast. *** In the bus, Nicolas thought that Monday would be another ordinary day, but many things were about to change in his life. He had white skin, blue eyes, medium and sharp nose, average lips, with the upper being slightly thicker than the lower; he was 5’10”, thin and his hair was dark brown. Romantic, he enjoyed physics and astronomy. His dream was to become a great physician and discover the secrets of the universe. He was studying Physics at the University of California, in Los Angeles, where he lived. The campus was crowded; students and teachers walked everywhere to get to the classrooms. Right at the entrance, Nicolas met his friend Sanchez, a Mexican-born American. His friend always wore his black hair combed to the right side, covering his big forehead. He was 5’11” and spoke the language with perfection, because he lived most of his life in the United States. “Hi, Nick. Today we’re going to meet a new student who got transferred from another university. We’ll also start that discipline we enrolled at in the beginning of the semester, do you remember? And the girl is on the same class. “This course took so much time to begin that I thought it was going to be cancelled. I’m anxious to learn his new subject and to meet the new student.” Nicolas replied. The first three periods of class had passed and the students could barely hide the curiosity about the next class, as well as the freshman, whose beauty had been already commented. At eleven o’clock, they heard the bell announcing the end of the class. Few students left, but many entered the new class. They were excited to learn new things. Finally, the coordinator of the physics department, Doctor Finken, walked into the room and said. “From now on, Cosmology, the science of the Universe, will be taught for those who signed up in the beginning of the period. The course’s coordinator had some problems filling in this position and that is the reason this class did not start yet. Fortunately, we found a very competent professional, who studies the outer space and the great secrets presently known by men. Dr. Carlsson Glein is a PhD in Cosmology.” The coordinator walked toward the door and opened it. “Come in, Doctor Glein.” The professor entered the classroom and looked at the group who were still starring at the door, because a surprisingly beautiful figure was standing in there. It was the new student who everybody was talking about it. When the coordinator, Doctor Finken, noticed the shadow that the new student placed over the Cosmology teacher, he said: “I’ll take the opportunity to introduce our new student, Zara.” And she walked into the room. Nicolas observed her and noticed that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Her hair was red, thick, reaching her shoulders; she had white and smooth skin, blue eyes, full lips and sculptural body, like it was the creation of an artist. She seemed to be around 25 or 30 years old and 5’7”. He soon became mesmerized and tried, with no success, to hide his surprise. Sanchez was sitting beside him and said astonished. “Wow! Nicolas, now the course will become more interesting. What a beauty.” “I’m surprised too. She’s gorgeous!” Zara looked around class and stared at Nicolas like she was trying to read his own thoughts. Then, she walked to the only vacant chair in the room, right by his side. “I’ll leave you alone with your class, Dr. Glein. I hope they like Cosmology.” Said Dr. Finken. “It’s fine. I’m sure they’ll like to study it, because the knowledge about the Universe is amazing.” He introduced himself to the class and began to explain the different subjects he was going to teach. It’s a science that studies the Universe structure, composition and its evolution. “As the noble Dr. Finken said, I graduated in physics, with a PhD in Cosmology. Today I’m going to make a brief introduction about the outer space, but before that I’d like everyone in this class to introduce themselves so we can get more comfortable during our course. We can start by the first one on my left.” The students began to introduce themselves, and it was Nicholas turn. “My name is Nicolas, but you can call me Nick. People here in college call me geek, but I don’t like labels. I dream of being a great physicist and to travel to the space.” Everyone began to laugh, and a student called Adam, who was sitting in the fourth chair on the right corner, said ironically. “You should become an astronaut. I think you’re in the wrong course.” “No more comments.” The professor intervened. “I ask you to be brief or we won’t be able to finish the presentations.” “Nicolas, don’t worry about the space trips.” Zara told him in a low voice, while other student was introducing himself. “Sometimes what we dream can be very close to us.” The boy didn’t understand what she meant but he was still observing everything with curiosity. During the student’s presentations, Zara looked deeply into Nicolas eyes, and he felt something different when he looked at her. A chill inside his chest, and his heart was beating so fast, things that he had never felt before. He wondered where someone with such beauty could come from. “It can’t be. She’s not looking at me. It must be a wrong impression. A woman like her would never get interested in a guy like me.” Nicolas thought. *** Later at home, after his homework he went downstairs to have dinner with his mother and his sister. “My son, today I wanted to give you a good morning kiss, but when I came downstairs you had already left. Why don’t you wake up earlier? So there would be some time for us to talk in the morning. All this rush isn’t good. I feel so lonely since your father has passed.” “That’s okay, mom. I’ll try to wake up a little earlier. We really only have time to talk at night, besides, I also want to give a good morning kiss to Sophia, even if she is not awake.” Sophia smiled happily. She was 8 years old and after her father’s death, she became her mother’s best friend and worshiped her brother. *** During the weekends, Nicolas liked to ride his bike around the city. There was a lot of green everywhere and beautiful landscapes to be admired. Along the way it was possible to find natural springs, that ran through bamboo pipes left by the owners of the sites along the trails. Whenever he got tired, he stopped; leaned the bike on a three and put both hands under the water that poured in abundance and drank it, until his thirsty was quenched. Then, he picked up the bike and kept going hearing the birds singing, which contrasted with the silence of the woods. On Sunday, he was strolling and some heavy drops of water began to fall from the sky. It was almost dark. He felt that nice smell of wet land and increased the speed to get to his home faster. But the rain got stronger and he decided to stop and rest, taking shelter beneath an abandoned hut. That was when, suddenly, a person came into his direction, also trying to escape the rain. As it was coming closer, he could notice it was a woman. Even in the darkness of the night he noticed he knew her. She stopped under the hut and said: “What a storm! Thank God we found this shelter.” “We were lucky, because I guess there isn’t any other in miles.” Nicolas said. “You are the new student, Zara.” “Hi, Nick. Is your name, right? It is nice of you to remember me. You even know my name.” “Yes, I am the student who wants to be an astronaut. Although the other students were laughing, something tells me that in a few decades, space travel will be very common. About your name, I’m sure all the students had already learned it; it’s not usual that a student caused so much admiration on her first day.” Zara blushed with the praise and replied. “Thank you, Nick. Can I call you that? I like your name.” “Yes, you can. It’s nice that you like my name.” “Don’t worry about the comments. There’s always someone to criticize us. Sometimes life changes so much and so fast that we can’t waste time with other people’s opinion.” There was a moment of complete silence; only the singing of the birds and the sound of the raindrops could be heard. They began to look at each other just like in the classroom. The rain was increasing, and he couldn’t hide the attraction he was feeling. She put her bike on the ground and got closer to him. Nicolas touched Zara’s soft skin and her eyes seemed to bewitch him. When the raindrops touched her body, a smell of jasmine made the atmosphere more pleasant. There was nothing else around and the boy let his emotions take over, as happened only a few times in his life. Everything was like a dream and he didn’t want to wake up; he kissed the lips that have messed so much with his heart. They surrendered to that infinite moment and that was the best thing that happened to them. Generally, when he met someone, Nick wasn’t used to feel something so intense, but with Zara everything was different. He had never met a woman with so much experience. He wondered what he could do to make her fall in love with him and stay by his side. It wasn’t enough to only admire her at the college, with a sudden passion; he became closer to her with the intensity of the kiss they shared. She interrupted his line of thoughts, which mingled with his dreams. “Nicolas, it’s getting late. I have to go, because we have classes in the morning. I’ll see you tomorrow.” “That’s okay, Zara. I really liked to see you. I’ll count the hours until tomorrow.” She touched his lips and smiled softly. Since the rain had already stopped, she grabbed her bike and left. The boy arrived home with shining eyes and a huge grin on his face, and Lorena noticed that something different had happened in that Sunday’s ride. “Son, will you tell me what is going on?” “I’ve never seen you so happy!” Sophia exclaimed. “Well... I... met... A person while I was riding my biking. I guess I am... in love.” Mother and daughter smiled understanding that something new happened with Nicolas, and it would certainly make him very happy. At that night, the young student went to bed early, dreaming of the serendipity meeting at the hut. Next day he had breakfast with his mother before his classes. When he was on the bus, he thought about his reaction to see Zara again. “Does she really feel something for me? Or was that only a quick moment?” He couldn’t control his emotions. Nicolas decided not to tell anything to his friends. They certainly wouldn’t believe and would laugh telling him that was only a fruit of his imagination. Sanchez came into the room and saw his friend ready for the class. “You’ve arrived early, my friend. You always wait in the courtyard until everyone is inside. What happened?” “Nothing. I’m just sitting here, thinking about life.” They kept talking until Dr. Glein entered the classroom. He greeted everyone and began his speech, explaining how the Theory of the Relativity worked. The students observed his explanations with attention, but Nicolas was looking at Zara, who was sitting by his side again, stared at her beautiful eyes and remembered the date they had in the previous day. She was also looking at Nicolas, returning the smile. At break time, he looked for her in the school’s courtyard. “May I talk to you for a moment?” “Yes. Let’s go to the cafeteria.” “I can’t forget what happened between us and I’d like to see you again on the weekend.” “I also liked very much what happened with us. Would you like to meet me in the same trail we met on Sunday? Is that okay?” “Sure... I... I’ll be there in the hut.” Zara knew that Nicolas also liked her and, somehow, she was also getting involved with him, who was at least ten years younger. However, it seemed that she knew him for some time. They began to meet every weekend and Sundays were always happy days. They shared kisses, caresses and rode their bikes, enjoying every moment together. After some weeks of relationship, Nicolas began to feel curious about the woman who changed his life. She noticed it was the perfect moment to tell a special secret that would change his view of the world. “Nicolas, I have something to tell you. I’m not from here. I live in a very distant place.” “I was curious to know where you came from. You have a different beauty, as if you lived in a Nordic country. Please, go on...” “In fact, I came from a place much farther away than just a country. I’m from a planet called Vida, in the Andromeda galaxy, many light-years away from here. As you would say: I’m an astronaut! I would like you to meet some people who travel with me. Would you like to join me?” “What is all this madness? Is the dream falling apart? She might be mentally disturbed. This would explain everything. All that love can’t be real, anyway, the boy thought, devastated because he couldn’t believe in what she was saying. Nick didn’t understand why she was telling that. It was obviously not true, but she seemed very smart and very secure to be crazy. Was everything a kind of joke? A game? Maybe she only wanted to play a trick on him. Since there wasn’t anybody around, he pretended to believe, and answered with an ironic voice: “Are they close?” “Close your eyes.” She said smiling, holding his hands. In an instant, they were in another place. They were inside a hi-tech spaceship and no longer in that abandoned hut. The boy was shocked! If that was really a ship, he was certainly taken to the control room. The technology that could be seen was something amazing, and he could observe a number of instruments which functions he could barely imagine. One of the walls was partly made of transparent glass, which allowed the crew to observe the exterior. He came closer and saw that they were parked next to a cloud, which was probably hiding the flying object. Looking from above, everything seemed extremely small. He couldn’t see, but the aircraft had a discoid shape, which favored the aerodynamics of motion in outer space, making it easy to travel at high speed. Holographic screens lined the edges of the room, reflecting lights of all colors and shades. It was all very intriguing. Still feeling lost; he admired everything around him, inside the ship. Perplexed, he recognized the Milky Way, slowly turning in a projected holograph. This image highlighted a blue planet, which was located right in the Arm of Orion. He could recognize this planet in any image. It was the Earth. “The most beautiful and perfect planet of the Universe.” he thought while he analyzed the image projected in three dimensions. And he also recognized the Andromeda galaxy. A planet stood out in this holography, as if it was being monitored. There was something special about it and he was curious, however, he wasn’t comfortable to ask Zara, since he was so lost within his thoughts. He continued to observe the things around him. The glass walls and holographic screens covered a lot of the space but he also noticed something made of silver, a clear shade, which reflected light and spread it through the entire place. Those surfaces were smooth and shiny. “Is this some kind of technology to save energy?” He wondered. The size of that control room was something that also intrigued Nicolas; the room seemed to have more than a hundred square meters, and he soon imagined the size of the whole ship. He couldn’t see any buttons or bars and apparently the entire control was managed by haplographies. He felt a scent of jasmine in the air, Zara’s perfume. “What a nice smell!” he thought while breathing the pure air of the ship. Nicolas was still amazed and took some time to believe in what he was seeing. Everything was new, intriguing, and he couldn’t understand what was around him, although he was trying to absorb it all. Zara, noticing the young man’s insecurity, began to explain. “Nicolas, calm down. I know it’s too much, but I’ll explain everything to you.” His was lost, just staring through the ship. He couldn’t believe that what she said it wasn’t a joke, but the truth. There was more to know than he ever imagined. He was still confused, without understanding exactly what was going on, but he turned to Zara, waiting to hear the rest of the explanation. “We’re here in a mission, and I needed to find you, for a very special reason, that I’ll explain later. I joined the college where you study as a student and it was easy to get transferred, because we can access the IT systems of the Earth information. I did this with the purpose to get close to you. But when I secured this human body, I had the same sensations and wishes you have! It was inevitable to feel something for you; I surrendered myself with no inhibitions and it was great. Keep calm, please. Our commandant Sivoc will explain things better for you. Don’t be afraid.” He couldn’t understand what she was saying, but there wasn’t much time to think, because three men approached from a door he hadn’t noticed before. Judging by the technology he could see in the ship, he deduced that those beings weren’t from Earth either. And despite Zara’s words, that were trying to calm him down, he began to sweat, and his heart began to race. Nervous, he was considering a thousand possibilities, “Will they suck my mind or make any kind of experience? Will they take me into a trip through the space? I’m going to wake up, I must be dreaming. I trust in Zara, but now I know that I don’t really know her. What if this trust isn’t deserved? And what if her, along with these three unknown men, want to harm me?” There was no more time for his conclusions. Soon, one of them approached and, judging by his attitude it was clear to understand that he was the commandant. “Greetings! My name is Sivoc; I’m the commandant of this ship. We came from a planet located in a galaxy close to the Milky Way.” The commandant had a human appearance. He was an Asian, very tall and wore a navy blue uniform with a cloth that shone when touched by the light. He had a serious semblance and he was concerned when he looked at the other members of the ship, who stood behind him, in silence. Zara was also there, only observing the scene that was happening. “I’m... My name is Nicolas. I live here in Los Angeles.” He answered, quivering. The commandant smiled, trying to make him feel more comfortable. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you in person, Nicolas. We already know a lot about you, but let me introduce you the rest of the crew. This is Drako, the responsible for the trip’s control instruments and he is also our information engineer. The other one is Tibor, chief of security. The only female crewmember is Zara, the doctor of the mission and the genetic engineer, and you already meet her.” Nicolas looked at each one while they were being introduced. They all looked like humans, like Zara and Sivoc. Drako used hair cut close to the scalp; he was also very tall. He barely showed any reaction when Nick greeted him and he quickly went back to the navigation system, from where he could control everything with just his fingertips on the holographic panels of the ship. The last member, Tibor, was the tallest and had a very serious semblance; his skin was clear and framed by muscled that showed a lot of strength. “We come from the planet Vida, which is three millions years distant from your planet. I am talking about the light speed, of course.” Added Sivoc. Nicolas observed his hosts with attention, and there would be things, to be revealed later, which would leave him much more surprised than that vision, but at that moment he didn’t know about it yet. He continued observing the ship’s equipments, which were still so impressive, but it looks like the navigator could control all the tasks by the power of his mind, telepathically. “Drako, get us out of here, immediately.” Said Sivoc, trying to not get too much attention. He turned to Nicolas and explained his request: “Although the space technology from the Earth government is somewhat outdated for our standards, they have special radar that can detect us. And it important to no reveal our presence and we need to get out of here with some urgency. You can be assured, however, that we’ll not do you any harm.” The vehicle began to takeoff at high speed and rose into the sky. Nicolas was looking at the Moon through the window and saw that it was getting closer. In a matter of seconds, it began to grow and became more beautiful. Soon, he was looking at its craters, and they were huge and gray, like a big and sandy desert, without water and no life at all. Suddenly, the ship stopped. After traveling to the exosphere, he felt his body and soul relaxing a little, noticing that his dream had finally became reality, and it was much better than he had seen in books and movies. For the first time in his life, he was capable to observe closely the grandiosity of the cosmos: the sun and its brightness, the planets in our Solar System, the stars so distant. It was magnificent. The Moon was clear, illuminated by the sun, with rays of light shining around. It was a wonderful image; raters of different shapes and sizes were visible from inside the ship. The boy already liked to admire the natural satellite in the days of full moon, even by distance, but it was even so much better to look closely. On the right he could see the blue planet he called home, the giant home of billions of human beings. He felt like an astronaut, and then he thought about how euphoric they must have felt when they saw our planet and satellite, for the first time. After that, he left his admiration aside and began to think again in the reason of this contact. “What could those beings from outer space want with a person like me, an ordinary student who has no connections with scientific or technological researches?” For an instant, he observed Zara and remembered the kisses and the embraces they shared. She looked him in the eyes as she always did since they met and sweetly smiled, as if she understood his thoughts. Nicolas answered with a smile, but deep inside he was scared. Sivoc, as if he knew what Nicolas was thinking, soon approached and began to explain what the purpose of the mission was. “Nicolas, I know it sounds very weird the way we’ve approached you and especially the fact that we brought you inside the ship with no further explanations. The truth is that we need you to help us to solve a serious problem in our planet.” The human didn’t understand anything. All that mystery had no connection to him. He always dreamed about knowing the universe; but he never intended to travel to other planets, especially with people he barely knew. Regarding Zara, he didn’t even know if she was the woman he imagined. “How can I be useful to these beings that have so much technology?” he reflected. “Many of our ancestors had landed here on Earth.” Drako joined the conversation. “We have information that the government of your planet tried to capture us to obtain information about our technology and knowledge. We’re here in a mission, and you can help us to protect our planet.” That was when Nicolas became more confused. “How can I succeed in protect their planet? As I can see, they could be much more useful to help my planet, showing a way to preserve human life, especially regarding the population and consumption growth and to shortage of food and water. They have much more technology and knowledge. More than I have, obviously.” He thought. Zara approached him and said: “The truth is that we are actually humans, just like you but from the future.” He became astonished with that revelation. Those instants inside the ship seemed like hours, it was as if time had stopped. Nicolas was more comfortable. Maybe it was an effect of the pure oxygen he was breathing, which made him feel as if nothing around him mattered. That was definitely a unique experience, he couldn’t understand what was happening, but he was paying attention to the information. After knowing about something so tremendous, he needed to know more, and Zara continued: “According to you time calendar, live on the Century 641. We managed to travel in time due to the technological advances of our people. We discovered gaps in space-time, what the physicists of your planet call warm-holes. We travel these long distances between our planets very quickly.” Sivoc interrupted the conversation. “Zara, we’d better be honest with Nicolas. He need to trust us, and the truth about our mission will show him that our intentions are the best possible and that we come in good faith. First tell him our main purpose, and then reveal the whole story from the beginning, so our visitor will understand better why we are here and our connection with his planet. Besides, we know he is in danger. The other ship from our planet is looking for him and they won’t have the same compassion for Nicolas.”",

      "content": "– I. The Meeting – Year 2017 Nicolas was preparing himself for another day at the university. He took his blue backpack with black stripes, full of books, a computer and his Smartphone, in which he could always check his e-mails and text messages sent by friends from college. He drank a glass of milk and took two bites of the sandwich prepared by his mother. He was running late as usual, to get to the bus for his classes. “Nicolas, wait! I need to talk to you.” Lorena shouted, unable to reach him. She looked at the door and saw that he was already inside the bus. She thought it would be better to talk to him at night, since he rarely sat at the table to have breakfast. *** In the bus, Nicolas thought that Monday would be another ordinary day, but many things were about to change in his life. He had white skin, blue eyes, medium and sharp nose, average lips, with the upper being slightly thicker than the lower; he was 5’10”, thin and his hair was dark brown. Romantic, he enjoyed physics and astronomy. His dream was to become a great physician and discover the secrets of the universe. He was studying Physics at the University of California, in Los Angeles, where he lived. The campus was crowded; students and teachers walked everywhere to get to the classrooms. Right at the entrance, Nicolas met his friend Sanchez, a Mexican-born American. His friend always wore his black hair combed to the right side, covering his big forehead. He was 5’11” and spoke the language with perfection, because he lived most of his life in the United States. “Hi, Nick. Today we’re going to meet a new student who got transferred from another university. We’ll also start that discipline we enrolled at in the beginning of the semester, do you remember? And the girl is on the same class. “This course took so much time to begin that I thought it was going to be cancelled. I’m anxious to learn his new subject and to meet the new student.” Nicolas replied. The first three periods of class had passed and the students could barely hide the curiosity about the next class, as well as the freshman, whose beauty had been already commented. At eleven o’clock, they heard the bell announcing the end of the class. Few students left, but many entered the new class. They were excited to learn new things. Finally, the coordinator of the physics department, Doctor Finken, walked into the room and said. “From now on, Cosmology, the science of the Universe, will be taught for those who signed up in the beginning of the period. The course’s coordinator had some problems filling in this position and that is the reason this class did not start yet. Fortunately, we found a very competent professional, who studies the outer space and the great secrets presently known by men. Dr. Carlsson Glein is a PhD in Cosmology.” The coordinator walked toward the door and opened it. “Come in, Doctor Glein.” The professor entered the classroom and looked at the group who were still starring at the door, because a surprisingly beautiful figure was standing in there. It was the new student who everybody was talking about it. When the coordinator, Doctor Finken, noticed the shadow that the new student placed over the Cosmology teacher, he said: “I’ll take the opportunity to introduce our new student, Zara.” And she walked into the room. Nicolas observed her and noticed that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Her hair was red, thick, reaching her shoulders; she had white and smooth skin, blue eyes, full lips and sculptural body, like it was the creation of an artist. She seemed to be around 25 or 30 years old and 5’7”. He soon became mesmerized and tried, with no success, to hide his surprise. Sanchez was sitting beside him and said astonished. “Wow! Nicolas, now the course will become more interesting. What a beauty.” “I’m surprised too. She’s gorgeous!” Zara looked around class and stared at Nicolas like she was trying to read his own thoughts. Then, she walked to the only vacant chair in the room, right by his side. “I’ll leave you alone with your class, Dr. Glein. I hope they like Cosmology.” Said Dr. Finken. “It’s fine. I’m sure they’ll like to study it, because the knowledge about the Universe is amazing.” He introduced himself to the class and began to explain the different subjects he was going to teach. It’s a science that studies the Universe structure, composition and its evolution. “As the noble Dr. Finken said, I graduated in physics, with a PhD in Cosmology. Today I’m going to make a brief introduction about the outer space, but before that I’d like everyone in this class to introduce themselves so we can get more comfortable during our course. We can start by the first one on my left.” The students began to introduce themselves, and it was Nicholas turn. “My name is Nicolas, but you can call me Nick. People here in college call me geek, but I don’t like labels. I dream of being a great physicist and to travel to the space.” Everyone began to laugh, and a student called Adam, who was sitting in the fourth chair on the right corner, said ironically. “You should become an astronaut. I think you’re in the wrong course.” “No more comments.” The professor intervened. “I ask you to be brief or we won’t be able to finish the presentations.” “Nicolas, don’t worry about the space trips.” Zara told him in a low voice, while other student was introducing himself. “Sometimes what we dream can be very close to us.” The boy didn’t understand what she meant but he was still observing everything with curiosity. During the student’s presentations, Zara looked deeply into Nicolas eyes, and he felt something different when he looked at her. A chill inside his chest, and his heart was beating so fast, things that he had never felt before. He wondered where someone with such beauty could come from. “It can’t be. She’s not looking at me. It must be a wrong impression. A woman like her would never get interested in a guy like me.” Nicolas thought. *** Later at home, after his homework he went downstairs to have dinner with his mother and his sister. “My son, today I wanted to give you a good morning kiss, but when I came downstairs you had already left. Why don’t you wake up earlier? So there would be some time for us to talk in the morning. All this rush isn’t good. I feel so lonely since your father has passed.” “That’s okay, mom. I’ll try to wake up a little earlier. We really only have time to talk at night, besides, I also want to give a good morning kiss to Sophia, even if she is not awake.” Sophia smiled happily. She was 8 years old and after her father’s death, she became her mother’s best friend and worshiped her brother. *** During the weekends, Nicolas liked to ride his bike around the city. There was a lot of green everywhere and beautiful landscapes to be admired. Along the way it was possible to find natural springs, that ran through bamboo pipes left by the owners of the sites along the trails. Whenever he got tired, he stopped; leaned the bike on a three and put both hands under the water that poured in abundance and drank it, until his thirsty was quenched. Then, he picked up the bike and kept going hearing the birds singing, which contrasted with the silence of the woods. On Sunday, he was strolling and some heavy drops of water began to fall from the sky. It was almost dark. He felt that nice smell of wet land and increased the speed to get to his home faster. But the rain got stronger and he decided to stop and rest, taking shelter beneath an abandoned hut. That was when, suddenly, a person came into his direction, also trying to escape the rain. As it was coming closer, he could notice it was a woman. Even in the darkness of the night he noticed he knew her. She stopped under the hut and said: “What a storm! Thank God we found this shelter.” “We were lucky, because I guess there isn’t any other in miles.” Nicolas said. “You are the new student, Zara.” “Hi, Nick. Is your name, right? It is nice of you to remember me. You even know my name.” “Yes, I am the student who wants to be an astronaut. Although the other students were laughing, something tells me that in a few decades, space travel will be very common. About your name, I’m sure all the students had already learned it; it’s not usual that a student caused so much admiration on her first day.” Zara blushed with the praise and replied. “Thank you, Nick. Can I call you that? I like your name.” “Yes, you can. It’s nice that you like my name.” “Don’t worry about the comments. There’s always someone to criticize us. Sometimes life changes so much and so fast that we can’t waste time with other people’s opinion.” There was a moment of complete silence; only the singing of the birds and the sound of the raindrops could be heard. They began to look at each other just like in the classroom. The rain was increasing, and he couldn’t hide the attraction he was feeling. She put her bike on the ground and got closer to him. Nicolas touched Zara’s soft skin and her eyes seemed to bewitch him. When the raindrops touched her body, a smell of jasmine made the atmosphere more pleasant. There was nothing else around and the boy let his emotions take over, as happened only a few times in his life. Everything was like a dream and he didn’t want to wake up; he kissed the lips that have messed so much with his heart. They surrendered to that infinite moment and that was the best thing that happened to them. Generally, when he met someone, Nick wasn’t used to feel something so intense, but with Zara everything was different. He had never met a woman with so much experience. He wondered what he could do to make her fall in love with him and stay by his side. It wasn’t enough to only admire her at the college, with a sudden passion; he became closer to her with the intensity of the kiss they shared. She interrupted his line of thoughts, which mingled with his dreams. “Nicolas, it’s getting late. I have to go, because we have classes in the morning. I’ll see you tomorrow.” “That’s okay, Zara. I really liked to see you. I’ll count the hours until tomorrow.” She touched his lips and smiled softly. Since the rain had already stopped, she grabbed her bike and left. The boy arrived home with shining eyes and a huge grin on his face, and Lorena noticed that something different had happened in that Sunday’s ride. “Son, will you tell me what is going on?” “I’ve never seen you so happy!” Sophia exclaimed. “Well... I... met... A person while I was riding my biking. I guess I am... in love.” Mother and daughter smiled understanding that something new happened with Nicolas, and it would certainly make him very happy. At that night, the young student went to bed early, dreaming of the serendipity meeting at the hut. Next day he had breakfast with his mother before his classes. When he was on the bus, he thought about his reaction to see Zara again. “Does she really feel something for me? Or was that only a quick moment?” He couldn’t control his emotions. Nicolas decided not to tell anything to his friends. They certainly wouldn’t believe and would laugh telling him that was only a fruit of his imagination. Sanchez came into the room and saw his friend ready for the class. “You’ve arrived early, my friend. You always wait in the courtyard until everyone is inside. What happened?” “Nothing. I’m just sitting here, thinking about life.” They kept talking until Dr. Glein entered the classroom. He greeted everyone and began his speech, explaining how the Theory of the Relativity worked. The students observed his explanations with attention, but Nicolas was looking at Zara, who was sitting by his side again, stared at her beautiful eyes and remembered the date they had in the previous day. She was also looking at Nicolas, returning the smile. At break time, he looked for her in the school’s courtyard. “May I talk to you for a moment?” “Yes. Let’s go to the cafeteria.” “I can’t forget what happened between us and I’d like to see you again on the weekend.” “I also liked very much what happened with us. Would you like to meet me in the same trail we met on Sunday? Is that okay?” “Sure... I... I’ll be there in the hut.” Zara knew that Nicolas also liked her and, somehow, she was also getting involved with him, who was at least ten years younger. However, it seemed that she knew him for some time. They began to meet every weekend and Sundays were always happy days. They shared kisses, caresses and rode their bikes, enjoying every moment together. After some weeks of relationship, Nicolas began to feel curious about the woman who changed his life. She noticed it was the perfect moment to tell a special secret that would change his view of the world. “Nicolas, I have something to tell you. I’m not from here. I live in a very distant place.” “I was curious to know where you came from. You have a different beauty, as if you lived in a Nordic country. Please, go on...” “In fact, I came from a place much farther away than just a country. I’m from a planet called Vida, in the Andromeda galaxy, many light-years away from here. As you would say: I’m an astronaut! I would like you to meet some people who travel with me. Would you like to join me?” “What is all this madness? Is the dream falling apart? She might be mentally disturbed. This would explain everything. All that love can’t be real, anyway, the boy thought, devastated because he couldn’t believe in what she was saying. Nick didn’t understand why she was telling that. It was obviously not true, but she seemed very smart and very secure to be crazy. Was everything a kind of joke? A game? Maybe she only wanted to play a trick on him. Since there wasn’t anybody around, he pretended to believe, and answered with an ironic voice: “Are they close?” “Close your eyes.” She said smiling, holding his hands. In an instant, they were in another place. They were inside a hi-tech spaceship and no longer in that abandoned hut. The boy was shocked! If that was really a ship, he was certainly taken to the control room. The technology that could be seen was something amazing, and he could observe a number of instruments which functions he could barely imagine. One of the walls was partly made of transparent glass, which allowed the crew to observe the exterior. He came closer and saw that they were parked next to a cloud, which was probably hiding the flying object. Looking from above, everything seemed extremely small. He couldn’t see, but the aircraft had a discoid shape, which favored the aerodynamics of motion in outer space, making it easy to travel at high speed. Holographic screens lined the edges of the room, reflecting lights of all colors and shades. It was all very intriguing. Still feeling lost; he admired everything around him, inside the ship. Perplexed, he recognized the Milky Way, slowly turning in a projected holograph. This image highlighted a blue planet, which was located right in the Arm of Orion. He could recognize this planet in any image. It was the Earth. “The most beautiful and perfect planet of the Universe.” he thought while he analyzed the image projected in three dimensions.

The glass walls and holographic screens covered a lot of the space but he also noticed something made of silver, a clear shade, which reflected light and spread it through the entire place. Those surfaces were smooth and shiny. “Is this some kind of technology to save energy?” He wondered. The size of that control room was something that also intrigued Nicolas; the room seemed to have more than a hundred square meters, and he soon imagined the size of the whole ship. He couldn’t see any buttons or bars and apparently the entire control was managed by haplographies. He felt a scent of jasmine in the air, Zara’s perfume. “What a nice smell!” he thought while breathing the pure air of the ship. Nicolas was still amazed and took some time to believe in what he was seeing. Everything was new, intriguing, and he couldn’t understand what was around him, although he was trying to absorb it all. Zara, noticing the young man’s insecurity, began to explain. “Nicolas, calm down. I know it’s too much, but I’ll explain everything to you.” His was lost, just staring through the ship. He couldn’t believe that what she said it wasn’t a joke, but the truth. There was more to know than he ever imagined. He was still confused, without understanding exactly what was going on, but he turned to Zara, waiting to hear the rest of the explanation. “We’re here in a mission, and I needed to find you, for a very special reason, that I’ll explain later.

But when I secured this human body, I had the same sensations and wishes you have! It was inevitable to feel something for you; I surrendered myself with no inhibitions and it was great. Keep calm, please. Our commandant Sivoc will explain things better for you. Don’t be afraid.” He couldn’t understand what she was saying, but there wasn’t much time to think, because three men approached from a door he hadn’t noticed before. Judging by the technology he could see in the ship, he deduced that those beings weren’t from Earth either. And despite Zara’s words, that were trying to calm him down, he began to sweat, and his heart began to race. Nervous, he was considering a thousand possibilities, “Will they suck my mind or make any kind of experience? Will they take me into a trip through the space? I’m going to wake up, I must be dreaming. I trust in Zara, but now I know that I don’t really know her. What if this trust isn’t deserved? And what if her, along with these three unknown men, want to harm me?” There was no more time for his conclusions.

And it important to no reveal our presence and we need to get out of here with some urgency. You can be assured, however, that we’ll not do you any harm.” The vehicle began to takeoff at high speed and rose into the sky. Nicolas was looking at the Moon through the window and saw that it was getting closer. In a matter of seconds, it began to grow and became more beautiful. Soon, he was looking at its craters, and they were huge and gray, like a big and sandy desert, without water and no life at all. Suddenly, the ship stopped. After traveling to the exosphere, he felt his body and soul relaxing a little, noticing that his dream had finally became reality, and it was much better than he had seen in books and movies. For the first time in his life, he was capable to observe closely the grandiosity of the cosmos: the sun and its brightness, the planets in our Solar System, the stars so distant. It was magnificent. The Moon was clear, illuminated by the sun, with rays of light shining around. It was a wonderful image; raters of different shapes and sizes were visible from inside the ship. The boy already liked to admire the natural satellite in the days of full moon, even by distance, but it was even so much better to look closely. On the right he could see the blue planet he called home, the giant home of billions of human beings. He felt like an astronaut, and then he thought about how euphoric they must have felt when they saw our planet and satellite, for the first time. After that, he left his admiration aside and began to think again in the reason of this contact. “What could those beings from outer space want with a person like me, an ordinary student who has no connections with scientific or technological researches?” For an instant, he observed Zara and remembered the kisses and the embraces they shared. She looked him in the eyes as she always did since they met and sweetly smiled, as if she understood his thoughts. Nicolas answered with a smile, but deep inside he was scared. Sivoc, as if he knew what Nicolas was thinking, soon approached and began to explain what the purpose of the mission was. “Nicolas, I know it sounds very weird the way we’ve approached you and especially the fact that we brought you inside the ship with no further explanations. The truth is that we need you to help us to solve a serious problem in our planet.” The human didn’t understand anything. All that mystery had no connection to him. He always dreamed about knowing the universe; but he never intended to travel to other planets, especially with people he barely knew. Regarding Zara, he didn’t even know if she was the woman he imagined. “How can I be useful to these beings that have so much technology?” he reflected. “Many of our ancestors had landed here on Earth.” Drako joined the conversation. “We have information that the government of your planet tried to capture us to obtain information about our technology and knowledge. We’re here in a mission, and you can help us to protect our planet.” That was when Nicolas became more confused. “How can I succeed in protect their planet? As I can see, they could be much more useful to help my planet, showing a way to preserve human life, especially regarding the population and consumption growth and to shortage of food and water. They have much more technology and knowledge. More than I have, obviously.” He thought. Zara approached him and said: “The truth is that we are actually humans, just like you but from the future.” He became astonished with that revelation. Those instants inside the ship seemed like hours, it was as if time had stopped. Nicolas was more comfortable. Maybe it was an effect of the pure oxygen he was breathing, which made him feel as if nothing around him mattered. That was definitely a unique experience, he couldn’t understand what was happening, but he was paying attention to the information. After knowing about something so tremendous, he needed to know more, and Zara continued: “According to you time calendar, live on the Century 641. We managed to travel in time due to the technological advances of our people. We discovered gaps in space-time, what the physicists of your planet call warm-holes. We travel these long distances between our planets very quickly.” Sivoc interrupted the conversation. “Zara, we’d better be honest with Nicolas. He need to trust us, and the truth about our mission will show him that our intentions are the best possible and that we come in good faith. First tell him our main purpose, and then reveal the whole story from the beginning, so our visitor will understand better why we are here and our connection with his planet. Besides, we know he is in danger. The other ship from our planet is looking for him and they won’t have the same compassion for Nicolas.”",

      "content": "– II. The Revelation – Nicolas didn’t know what was going on and was perplexed taking in the revelations. He looked at Sivoc with attention, waiting for the promised explanations, and trying very hard to understand what was being said. But what he wanted the most was to know why he was there. “In fact, Nicolas, you have an organic defense that’s completely different from the other human beings.” Sivoc said. “This unique feature made you became the object our future studies.” The boy became bewildered with the revelation! “How come he was different from the other human beings?” Nicolas thought. “The information about you contained in the medical files and shared in networks made you known as the bearer of the most powerful biological defense among all earthling beings on Earth.” The commandant continued his explanations while the boy looked at him with attention, avid for more. “Your blood contains an extraordinary series of lymphocytes, like no one else. Such series was called X-Lymphocytes, and it makes you immunologically strong against infections and diseases of all kinds.” Everything suddenly made sense to Nicolas. After all, while many colleagues had flu and other diseases, so common during childhood and teenager years like viruses, he had never got sick. He even pretended some indispositions to ditch classes, but the truth was that he had never been sick. “The future scientists concluded that some genetic mutation had happened in your defense cells, which would explain how your organism managed to develop this healing power.” Sivoc explained. “I guess I already know what they want with me. They would certainly want to make experiences with my blood in their planet. I don’t want to travel with them. I need to find a way to get out of here. I can’t lose the family I love so much! But how will I escape?” Nicolas considered. There was an explanation for such healing ability, but it would be revealed only in the future, and the group would still experience many adventures, before the secrets of the X-Lymphocytes were unraveled. Zara noticed the boy’s affliction and asked Sivoc to continue to explain everything to him. “Please, tell Nick about our purposes. He’s a good person and will understand we’re being sincere.” And then he continued: “We came for you as a request from the governor of our planet, the king Zador II. The princess Isadora, daughter of our king, contracted a rare disease caused by a virus. Not even the most modern resources available in the planet Vida were enough to cure her. However, we knew you existed and we also knew about the X-Lymphocytes. Since we owned the technology necessary to travel to the past using the gap of space and the mechanisms of fold space, we decided to reach you, the earthling being with the strongest immunologic defense. Even in our time, there was no other human with such capacity.” Nicolas had no idea of what was happening, especially because the strength of his immunological system would be discovered only a few years later. He noticed that he was somehow special, but he couldn’t understand how much. And he still feared what they could really want from him, because he didn’t want to become a laboratory rat and go through numerous and painful experiments. “King Zador II would certainly feel very pleased with those who could help to cure his daughter, and a large reward was offered. Thus, in a meeting with his counselors, he asked us to prepared two teams to travel to the past and find you.” “The team I am charge of was chosen by the counselor Kenan, very loyal to the king. He elected us based in our scientific and technological knowledge. They gave us the ship Science II, this one in which we’re right now.” At this moment, Sivoc opened his arms making Nicola’s eyes wander around the ship. “The other team was chosen by Mirov, a counselor who plans to steal the throne behind the king’s back, based in his military skills. They received the ship Challenge I, and his commandment Merko is a very experienced military ambitious, who is capable of anything to achieve his goals.” “Luckily, Challenge I had to go through some repairs and we were able to leave first. That’s why we reached you before them. Our purpose is simple we want to take you to our planet so you can donate a small quantity of your medulla cells. These cells are our only hope to cure the princess.” Nicolas was impressed with revelation. “So I won’t need to be a bait of experiments? They only need a donation?” the boy thought. While still thinking, the commandant continued: “Our biggest problem is that if the princess dies, the king will have no successors. The rules of our planet are clear. The new governor will have to be chosen among the members of the council. That was why Mirov wanted to separate a team, as a way to earn more prestige. We fear that the real intention of the crew Challenge is to eliminate you, destroying the only chance to save the princess. So, we want to protect you and assure the survival of our future queen.” At this moment, Zara decided to speak and tell him some more compelling arguments. “The virus that attacked Isadora seems to be a fairly aggressive mutant of the same virus that had already taken her mother’s life. It attacks the blood cells and can’t be fought by any of the traditional forms known by doctors. The princess is anemic and getting weaker every day. We believe that only the lymphocytes of your medulla may save her, because they’re very strong and resistant.” Nicolas felt himself very satisfied for being able to contribute in some way to help Isadora. At first he feared what they could do to him, but now that he knew they only wanted to save another life, and that he could help with a simple donation, he couldn’t deny the request. The sensation of saving a little girl life is a unique and he could barely wait to do it. Zara was introducing to him not only a completely different world, but also a way to be a better human.” “Tell me about her.” Nicolas knew that there were more important questions to be asked; all of them were fighting inside his mind. But at that moment, that was the only question that came out from his lips. “She’s a beautiful 7 years old girl, with lovely and kind face. She likes to play and really hopes to be cured.” Zara answered. “So, Nick, will you come with us? Please, help us to save our princess.” After knowing the real reason of the trip, Nicolas began to think how good would be to save a person, especially a girl’s life. He loved his sister and he could never think about her being sick and not helping. He had already decided. They were asking so little of him and it would be a pleasure to help in Isadora’s cure. He said: “If it is up to me she will be fine. I’ll do everything I can.” He said, with his altruistic spirit. “But promise me that you’ll bring me back. I need to take care of my mother and my sister. I’m the only one left in their lives and I can’t stay away from them.” “We’ll bring you back, I promise.” The boy was relieved after hearing from Zara the promise that they would bring him back home. He thought he would live the biggest adventure of his life, and then he could return to his family, on Earth. Nicolas had thousands of questions to make, but while he thought about them, a little robot, in the shape of a dog, leaned at his feet. “What’s that?” he asked, smiling, finding everything incredible. Now that his fears had vanished, he was very calm, and the curiosity returned in full swing. The robot’s approximation helped to relieve the mood, which was a little heavy because of the fear for the princess’ life. “I was scared when this thing touched me.” “We have some robots in our planet which are just like the old pets. They serve as companies, friends and also as weapons. This is Little Wolf. Sometimes he even participates in missions with us. But normally he stays inside here taking care of the ship and not allowing anybody inside.” “He’s scratching his head in my legs. It seems that he likes me.” Nicolas said, petting the head of the small creature, just like a dog from Earth. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t save all of the Earth animals. However, those we could not save from extinction, we managed to clone using the DNA and the robotic technology, creating bionic beings with some features of the extinct animal. Little Wolf had the gene responsible for that kind and domestic attitude, very peculiar to the Earth dogs. But don’t be fooled, Little Wolf’s eyes fire a laser of high precision and range. His bridle is equipped with infra and ultra sound hearing. He can be very useful in some missions. And he is a good companion, but also a very useful weapon.” Immediately, Nicolas moved away from Little Wolf, thinking it would be better not play with him. On Earth, the pets were definitely less dangerous. Zara smiled, reading his thoughts. The boy was much calmer and also happy to be able to help these people. And that robot made him sure that there was a lot to learn with that team. He would donate some cells to save a child, and he would be glad to do some good, and was sure he would learn a lot with during the trip.",

      "content": "III. The Development of the Human Being Sivoc knew they wouldn’t be able to stay there for long. The danger was stalking them in more than one form and it was necessary to think of a safe place to stay. The Earth government was eager to capture them, targeting the advanced technology they possessed. On the other hand, Merko and its soldiers were also on the way and would never work together with them. While Sivoc, Drako and Tibor talked about the best strategy to protect themselves, Nicolas and Zara stayed away from the discussion. Zara knew the commander’s desire to tell the young man about the transformation of the human being, the way it had evolved until what it was about to become in the future. She thought that was the best moment to begin to tell her story: “Nick, I’m so glad you agreed to help us. While the rest of the crew is busy I would like to tell you a bit more about the evolution of the human species. Would you like to hear?” Nicolas’s eyes beamed with expectation of learning! “Please, Zara, I’d love to hear more about what happened. However, I imagine that the human being hasn’t changed much, since you have the appearance of a normal person.” The geneticist laughed with his statement. It was funny, but made sense, after all, he haven’t seen the real shape of the crew yet. “You are wrong, but I will start this story from the beginning. We know all the biological mechanism of the species in this planet, so we don’t need to make experiments with humans. When we perform our missions, the main purposes are to collect gens so our planet can recover extinct breed by cloning. The Science II has an immense database with most of the terrestrial genomes.” “I’ll explain briefly how we develop ourselves from the modern Homo sapiens. The human brain has a surprisingly capacity for data storage. With the advance of information technology and the increase of the human knowledge, brain development was accelerated by each generation.” The boy listened to what Zara was saying and felt completely immersed in an unknown and fantastic world. Every moment, he became more and more curious. “Therefore, the inventions and technologies grow exponentially, and the human mind has developed more quickly, making the brain and, consequently the skull, a lot bigger in comparison with the face. Due to changes in the eating patterns that have already started in the last two centuries, the jaws began to atrophy because of the lack of chewing food, since became more industrialized and soft. Without the movement of chewing the last teeth of each series of arcades, incisors, premolars and molars have disappeared, becoming only dental elements for residues. The jaw was reduced to the size we have in the future because of the reduction of its function.” Nicolas had never heard about that in his short life existence. ‘What is Zara referring to? Will we become bigheaded with small chins?’ He thought. With her telepathic abilities, the geneticist noticed that he clearly understood how human evolution had occurred. And she decided to continue the conversation telepathically: “Your conclusion about the future is correct. That’s why I said that we are the future of the human race.” “Zara, you’re reading my mind and talking to me telepathically. This is simply fantastic. I’d love to do that too!” He was really impressed with such ability, but also confused. “I don’t understand! How can you be so evolved if look exactly like the people I know?” She smiled and, telepathically, began to tell Nicolas about how man destroyed the terrestrial ecosystem: “I’ll get there, but first I have more things to tell. We know that the sun around which the Earth still moves will last around 6 billion years, but in order to preserve the planet is necessary that the humans are aware of the renewal of ecosystems. In a few decades, man will begin to use nuclear energy more often, since there will be no alternative to supply the lack of oil. He will dominate the technology of nuclear fusion, which will allow a multiplication of energy sources and increase of radiation. However, with the ineffectiveness of the methods of radioactive control, mainly by countries, which will use this method without total understanding, there will be a greater destruction of the ozone layer. Consequently, a greater amount of solar radiation will enter the planet and will drastically modify the climatic conditions. This will make it hard on the planet survival and a search for another planet to become a base will start. It will become necessary the use of domes with filtered oxygen and protection against solar and cosmic radiation. With this, the work of heating the air through the nostrils, to better absorb the oxygen, will be extinct, determining the nasal atrophy and reducing the nose into two small holes in the middle of the face.” Nicolas tried to imagine how this human being from the future would be, but it wasn’t easy. And Zara still had things to say: “The binocular vision of the humans also suffered some adaptations. When the man finally began to live in space, his vision had to be adapted to this new lifestyle, improving perception of depth to see well and to see the most distant objects. This made the eyeballs becomes more distant and bigger. Human fingers also have atrophied due to the modification of the labor methods because with the automation of the productions there was no need for manual work. Across the generations, the function of the fingers was lost and the hand was left with only three fingers, without fingernails. With the use of telepathy to communicate, the ears degenerated and reduced the size for the entrance of sounds.” The boy imagined himself with the mentioned features and feared that what he had just heard was true. Maybe if he told it to his college friends, he would be called crazy. Nobody would believe, even if it were the truth. He looked at the aliens and couldn’t see such changes. ‘Are they using some kind of costume?’ thought the boy. It was difficult to accept everything that took place in several millenniums in just a few hours. While Zara and Nicolas talked about the evolution of the human being, Sivoc and the others decided to leave the exosphere and hide the ship at sea. They were trying to deceive Merko and find the best moment to return to the planet Life. They needed to leave the ionosphere with safety and this was the best alternative. Listening to the conversation between the two, Sivoc decided to interfere, summarizing the matter: “When you get to our planet,” said the commander, “you’ll see how we value the environment. We recycle everything that’s possible and take care of our race, animals and vegetables. Besides, we don’t make war with other species. The military force exists to protect the planet against possible alien threats, meteors or problems involving the planet, like epidemics or environmental disasters. Are you ready to see the appearance of the human being of our time?” Nicolas just nodded, agreeing. Telepathically, the captain asked everyone to put some kind of sunglasses in their eyes. Then, he ordered that they assumed their real appearances. That was when the young boy really understood everything. They were using a different appearance not to scare him, since their original form was really impressive, so different than what he was used, just the way Zara explained with so many details. Minutes after watching them, the boy looked at Zara and a tear fell from his eyes. He thought: “Like had ever happened in my life, when I think I will have a serious relationship, everything ends. Zara and I have nothing in common; I just now see how different we are.” She noticed Nick’s disappointment when she saw his sad semblance and told everyone telepathically to become human again. She felt something new for the human, an emotion she had never experienced before. After returning to the form of the beautiful woman for whom Nicolas had fallen in love, she saw him smile with the same innocence of young man she met in college. Somehow, seeing her as a human being, similar to him, gave him some hope of perpetuating the love he felt. However, the young man was amused with the use of this transmutation technology and pondered: ‘Would it be also possible for me to use these glasses and turn me into whomever I want to be? It’s unbelievable!’ Sivoc ordered Drako to take the ship into the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, at a latitude and longitude next the city of Tampico. While the ship was moving there, he showed to the boy how gravity worked: “With the knowledge initiated by the Theory of Relativity, by a scientist of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein, it was possible to understand the balance of space-time-gravity. Scientists managed to study the changes that large celestial bodies, with mass and weight sufficiently able to deform the space-time, can cause in the universe, creating gravitational fields. The propulsion engines of folds we use are able to create a bubble around the ship, contracting the space in front of it and expanding the space left behind. This allows achieving large intergalactic distances respecting the law of general relativity that doesn’t allow that objects with large mass travel almost at the speed of light. We managed to create an artificial gravity using discoid ships which have rotational centrifuge speed, which creates a gravitational force similar to the Earth and to the Planet Vida, and benefits the structure and the blood circulation of the human body.” We traveled through wormholes formed from the space-time curvatures between opposing gravitational fields forming passage bridges between distant galaxies.” Nicolas was a Physics student and loved those issues about time traveling, life in other planets, and the law of relativity, energy sources and artificial gravity. To listen and to know that those explanations were actually used was just wonderful. Zara enthusiastically showed the galaxy where they lived in the virtual screen. She pointed her planet, which was located at a similar distance to our Earth to the sun. That was Vida, the planet where they all lived. She accessed a few images, and Nicolas could observe that the planet had some resemblance with Earth, because there was a lot of water and of green areas with different types of forests. “Andromeda is a spiral galaxy and is located about 2.9 million light years away from the solar system, to which the Earth belongs.” Explained the geneticist. “It’s the closest galaxy from the Milky Way and it was named is due to the Constellation of Andromeda, which the galaxy belongs.” This constellation has its name originated from the mythological princess Andromeda. This galaxy is also known as Messier 31 and its number of stars is twice bigger than in our galaxy.” She finished by saying that with the environmental degradation of the Earth, the man was forced to look for other places in the space to live, and conditions of other planets in the Milky Way weren’t adequate to the terrestrial life. First the human being created a colony on the moon, then in Mars and, with the knowledge he was acquiring, he could go farther and farther. “This place was the best we found.” She explained. “Since we could produce water from large glaciers and we managed to heat the planet with sources of energy from nuclear fusion. This caused a cycle of evaporation of water, which added to forest plantations, genetically designed, and established a continuing photosynthesis, also due to a privileged position of the planet Vida, in relation to the sun of our system. We also managed to save some species of animals and plants that we take with us on our trips throughout the space. There are still several domestic animals on our planet, which in the future are also different from how you know today. They all have suffered changes with the evolution process. With a quite diverse database of DNA, it became possible to clone several extinct species and recover much of the lost biodiversity.” Said the doctor, who at that time was no longer the simple beautiful woman he had met while trying to escape the rain, but someone who captivated him more and more. *** While the crew of the ship was talking, the Multinational Space Station observed on its radar the presence of an UFO in the Earth’s stratosphere region. “Attention, control mission on Earth. There is a presence of a ship near the Siberian region. Is there any air-fighter available in the area?” Asked the French commander, Raonut, head of multinational space station. “Listening loud and clear, orbital station command. Here speaks the commandant of the Russian space mission, in Moscow. We have two Sukhoi fighters ready to intercept. Please confirm the order of destruction.” Said the head of the Russian space mission, Sergey Yurich. “We have two F16 fighters near Germany. We’ll send it immediately.” Said Lieutenant Colonel Smith, from American command.” “Try to capture the ship and the crew and. It would be a milestone in human history. If they are hostile, you can destroy the ship.” Raonut confirmed. “Okay, let’s execute the mission.” Yurich replied. “Understood.” Said the American space control mission. *** Drako, watching the conversation kept his attention on the ship’s holograms. “Commander Sivoc, we were identified by radars of the Multinational Space Station. Four fighters are coming our way. We need to get away as quickly as possible. Two of them are coming from the East and more two are moving west.” “Take us to the orbit of Jupiter. There we’ll be invisible to the radars.” Ordered Sivoc. In a spectacular speed, they left the Earth’s orbit and reached Jupiter, crossing the belt of meteors and entered the orbit of the satellite Ganymede. *** “Orbital Station, Yurich speaking from Russian Space Command on Earth.” “I hear loud and clear.” Raonut replied. “The UFO just disappeared from our radars. Can you see it?” “Negative, Yurich. I will ask the European and American commands to try to locate them.” “Smith in listening. I also missed the target on the radar. Abort the mission.”",

      "content": "III. The Development of the Human Being Sivoc knew they wouldn’t be able to stay there for long. The danger was stalking them in more than one form and it was necessary to think of a safe place to stay. The Earth government was eager to capture them, targeting the advanced technology they possessed. On the other hand, Merko and its soldiers were also on the way and would never work together with them. While Sivoc, Drako and Tibor talked about the best strategy to protect themselves, Nicolas and Zara stayed away from the discussion. Zara knew the commander’s desire to tell the young man about the transformation of the human being, the way it had evolved until what it was about to become in the future. She thought that was the best moment to begin to tell her story: “Nick, I’m so glad you agreed to help us. While the rest of the crew is busy I would like to tell you a bit more about the evolution of the human species. Would you like to hear?” Nicolas’s eyes beamed with expectation of learning! “Please, Zara, I’d love to hear more about what happened. However, I imagine that the human being hasn’t changed much, since you have the appearance of a normal person.” The geneticist laughed with his statement. It was funny, but made sense, after all, he haven’t seen the real shape of the crew yet. “You are wrong, but I will start this story from the beginning. We know all the biological mechanism of the species in this planet, so we don’t need to make experiments with humans. When we perform our missions, the main purposes are to collect gens so our planet can recover extinct breed by cloning. The Science II has an immense database with most of the terrestrial genomes.” “I’ll explain briefly how we develop ourselves from the modern Homo sapiens. The human brain has a surprisingly capacity for data storage. With the advance of information technology and the increase of the human knowledge, brain development was accelerated by each generation.” The boy listened to what Zara was saying and felt completely immersed in an unknown and fantastic world. Every moment, he became more and more curious. “Therefore, the inventions and technologies grow exponentially, and the human mind has developed more quickly, making the brain and, consequently the skull, a lot bigger in comparison with the face. Due to changes in the eating patterns that have already started in the last two centuries, the jaws began to atrophy because of the lack of chewing food, since became more industrialized and soft. Without the movement of chewing the last teeth of each series of arcades, incisors, premolars and molars have disappeared, becoming only dental elements for residues. The jaw was reduced to the size we have in the future because of the reduction of its function.” Nicolas had never heard about that in his short life existence. ‘What is Zara referring to? Will we become bigheaded with small chins?’ He thought. With her telepathic abilities, the geneticist noticed that he clearly understood how human evolution had occurred. And she decided to continue the conversation telepathically: “Your conclusion about the future is correct. That’s why I said that we are the future of the human race.” “Zara, you’re reading my mind and talking to me telepathically. This is simply fantastic. I’d love to do that too!” He was really impressed with such ability, but also confused. “I don’t understand! How can you be so evolved if look exactly like the people I know?” She smiled and, telepathically, began to tell Nicolas about how man destroyed the terrestrial ecosystem: “I’ll get there, but first I have more things to tell. We know that the sun around which the Earth still moves will last around 6 billion years, but in order to preserve the planet is necessary that the humans are aware of the renewal of ecosystems. In a few decades, man will begin to use nuclear energy more often, since there will be no alternative to supply the lack of oil. He will dominate the technology of nuclear fusion, which will allow a multiplication of energy sources and increase of radiation. However, with the ineffectiveness of the methods of radioactive control, mainly by countries, which will use this method without total understanding, there will be a greater destruction of the ozone layer. Consequently, a greater amount of solar radiation will enter the planet and will drastically modify the climatic conditions. This will make it hard on the planet survival and a search for another planet to become a base will start. It will become necessary the use of domes with filtered oxygen and protection against solar and cosmic radiation. With this, the work of heating the air through the nostrils, to better absorb the oxygen, will be extinct, determining the nasal atrophy and reducing the nose into two small holes in the middle of the face.” Nicolas tried to imagine how this human being from the future would be, but it wasn’t easy. And Zara still had things to say: “The binocular vision of the humans also suffered some adaptations. When the man finally began to live in space, his vision had to be adapted to this new lifestyle, improving perception of depth to see well and to see the most distant objects. This made the eyeballs becomes more distant and bigger. Human fingers also have atrophied due to the modification of the labor methods because with the automation of the productions there was no need for manual work. Across the generations, the function of the fingers was lost and the hand was left with only three fingers, without fingernails. With the use of telepathy to communicate, the ears degenerated and reduced the size for the entrance of sounds.” The boy imagined himself with the mentioned features and feared that what he had just heard was true. Maybe if he told it to his college friends, he would be called crazy. Nobody would believe, even if it were the truth. He looked at the aliens and couldn’t see such changes. ‘Are they using some kind of costume?’ thought the boy. It was difficult to accept everything that took place in several millenniums in just a few hours. While Zara and Nicolas talked about the evolution of the human being, Sivoc and the others decided to leave the exosphere and hide the ship at sea. They were trying to deceive Merko and find the best moment to return to the planet Life. They needed to leave the ionosphere with safety and this was the best alternative. Listening to the conversation between the two, Sivoc decided to interfere, summarizing the matter: “When you get to our planet,” said the commander, “you’ll see how we value the environment. We recycle everything that’s possible and take care of our race, animals and vegetables. Besides, we don’t make war with other species. The military force exists to protect the planet against possible alien threats, meteors or problems involving the planet, like epidemics or environmental disasters. Are you ready to see the appearance of the human being of our time?” Nicolas just nodded, agreeing. Telepathically, the captain asked everyone to put some kind of sunglasses in their eyes. Then, he ordered that they assumed their real appearances. That was when the young boy really understood everything. They were using a different appearance not to scare him, since their original form was really impressive, so different than what he was used, just the way Zara explained with so many details. Minutes after watching them, the boy looked at Zara and a tear fell from his eyes. He thought: “Like had ever happened in my life, when I think I will have a serious relationship, everything ends. Zara and I have nothing in common; I just now see how different we are.” She noticed Nick’s disappointment when she saw his sad semblance and told everyone telepathically to become human again. She felt something new for the human, an emotion she had never experienced before. After returning to the form of the beautiful woman for whom Nicolas had fallen in love, she saw him smile with the same innocence of young man she met in college. Somehow, seeing her as a human being, similar to him, gave him some hope of perpetuating the love he felt. However, the young man was amused with the use of this transmutation technology and pondered: ‘Would it be also possible for me to use these glasses and turn me into whomever I want to be? It’s unbelievable!’ Sivoc ordered Drako to take the ship into the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, at a latitude and longitude next the city of Tampico. While the ship was moving there, he showed to the boy how gravity worked: “With the knowledge initiated by the Theory of Relativity, by a scientist of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein, it was possible to understand the balance of space-time-gravity. Scientists managed to study the changes that large celestial bodies, with mass and weight sufficiently able to deform the space-time, can cause in the universe, creating gravitational fields. The propulsion engines of folds we use are able to create a bubble around the ship, contracting the space in front of it and expanding the space left behind. This allows achieving large intergalactic distances respecting the law of general relativity that doesn’t allow that objects with large mass travel almost at the speed of light. We managed to create an artificial gravity using discoid ships which have rotational centrifuge speed, which creates a gravitational force similar to the Earth and to the Planet Vida, and benefits the structure and the blood circulation of the human body.” We traveled through wormholes formed from the space-time curvatures between opposing gravitational fields forming passage bridges between distant galaxies.” Nicolas was a Physics student and loved those issues about time traveling, life in other planets, and the law of relativity, energy sources and artificial gravity. To listen and to know that those explanations were actually used was just wonderful. Zara enthusiastically showed the galaxy where they lived in the virtual screen. She pointed her planet, which was located at a similar distance to our Earth to the sun. That was Vida, the planet where they all lived. She accessed a few images, and Nicolas could observe that the planet had some resemblance with Earth, because there was a lot of water and of green areas with different types of forests. “Andromeda is a spiral galaxy and is located about 2.9 million light years away from the solar system, to which the Earth belongs.” Explained the geneticist. “It’s the closest galaxy from the Milky Way and it was named is due to the Constellation of Andromeda, which the galaxy belongs.” This constellation has its name originated from the mythological princess Andromeda.

      "content": "IV. Another Ship on its Way to Earth Meanwhile, the ship Challenge I was ready to leave. The coordinates were already set on the wormhole formed near Jupiter’s moon, Calisto, where the gravitational curvatures between Andromeda and the Milky Way galaxy could be found. There was located the other bridge of space-time. Merko was anxious because of the delay and Mirov gave the final instructions: “Commander Merko, don’t forget to keep me updated through my particular communication channel. I want you to report the information about the mission directly to me. The other ship is unable to perform this kind of mission. If the people from Earth attack them, they will be captured; they are not prepared for the fight. Tibor can’t protect them alone.” “Lord Counselor, me and my team will do our best to get to the Earth with safety. No one will stop me from achieving my purposes.” “I want you to bring him dead or alive. If he dies, separate the bone marrow in the ship cryogenic laboratory, because what matters is the blood and his special defense cells.” Radof, Mirov’s assistant, got surprised with the order of his master; he knew that saving the princess’s life was not in his plans. When Mirov left to his chambers he talked to him after reading his thoughts: “I need the commander to bring me the earthling anyway. I need him to complete my plan to dominate the kingdom. Merko has to trust my noble intentions. Although everyone fears him for his strength and force, he is a man of principles. I’ll change the boy’s marrow bone and by the time the girl needs it the most it will be too late.” “Very insightful, sir. No one will suspect your plan and choosing Merko was a masterpiece.” “The commander has never failed. The conviction that he’ll conduct an honorable mission will help him achieve success. Now be quiet and prepare the communication room in my chamber so we can monitor everything.” Challenge I descended into the Earth’s atmosphere at high speed. They arrived in Alaska, where there was an extraterrestrial base inside a mountain. A huge door opened among the snow castles, allowing the ship to enter without any problems. Captain Crom reported to his commander: “Sir, having one of our bases here is highly strategic. We became immune to the Earth radars and we still have a place to hide ourselves and prepare our military tactics. We need to worry only in finding the earthling, without fearing for our safety.” “Previous missions were performed in order to build this. We visited Earth several times, that’s why we know the place very well. It is extremely important that we focus only on our mission. We’ll leave in a few moments.” The crew of Challenge I didn’t know the whereabouts of Sivoc’s team, but they believed that they had arrived on Earth before. However, it was necessary to seek information about the target. Merko and his team, all in human form, teleported themselves to the city of Los Angeles. They synchronized the coordinates and pressed some kind of watch they were wearing on their wrists. The technologies used on the sunglasses and watches teleportation were similar. When they entered the gravitational field of a planet, a satellite robot was able to absorb the cosmic radiation of the stars and use it as an energy source. A chip located in the sunglasses scanned and read the DNA of the cell or tissue of the human whose identity they desired to copy the robot processed the information. The information about the current latitude and longitude had to be transferred to the satellite in order to materialize the DNA anywhere in that area. Crom had the files with all the information about the mission: “Commander Merko, I’ve got some information with names, photographs and addresses of students who study with the human. We can try to get some information from them.” Merko raised a pen and an icon signal holography with the information they were discussing showed up on the screen. He touched one side of the picture and accessed the conversations between Nicolas and his friends on social networks, looking for something that would reveal the whereabouts of the earthling. The two of them leaned from the files and study the best strategy after and, after a lot of much deliberation, they reached a consensus. “Let’s find some information on the boy’s residence. His mother probably knows where he is.” Merko said. They went toward Nicolas’ house, in the suburbs of the city. Lorena was at home, and Sophia was at school. While the others members of the search group were watching the surroundings, Merko and Crom veiled themselves as police investigators and knocked on the door. They were dressed in black suit and tie, wearing polished black shoes, had their hair neatly combed and had identification badges with fake names. The mother answered the door, worried about the presence of investigators in her house. Thinking the worst, her eyes were filled by tears. For a moment, Merko looked at Lorena and felt something different, as if he already knew her from somewhere. But he decided to ignore the feeling and turn his attention to the search. Lorena also felt something different about the tall, strong man. His smell wasn’t strange to her, who was watching her closely, and she was trying to remember from where. Since they were police detectives, she thought she probably knew him from somewhere on the streets of Los Angeles. “Did anything happen to my son? He disappeared a few days ago and we don’t know anything about it.” “Madam, we came here exactly to seek information about your son. There was a report about his disappearance made by a friend from college, and our chief requested that our personal investigation. Do you know where he is?” “But... I thought you knew something about Nicolas. He disappeared and we’re waiting for some news that can give us some hope.” Crom looked at Merko raising his eyebrows. The commander telepathically read Lorena’s mind and found out that she really knew nothing that could help them. So they quickly said goodbye and left her alone. It was difficult to get any clue about the boy, and they needed to find him and complete the mission before the princess’s life faded. Crom was also concerned with their discretion while searching for their target on Earth: “Commander, it’s important not to leave traces of our presence here. We know that there is a special team investigating ETs, the Alpha-Omega, which could cause us problems. I still remember that story about the issues you had with them, when your best friend died in a mission here on this planet. We must be brief and objective.” Alpha-Omega was a secret team of the American government responsible for investigating any trace of alien presence around the Earth. Because they were directly linked to the Pentagon, they could request support from national security forces. When they imprisoned some specimen they used the secret military basis of Arizona, in the area 51 for seclusion and studies. “Dear Crom, you’re right. I’m a bit over the top with my actions and you are right, we will end up leaving traces. Let’s be subtler and try to go unnoticed. Then, Crom had an idea and spoke to the commander: “Why don’t you ask your contact in our planet about Sivocs’ coordinates? There is no greater advantage than information. He told you that they are here already.” “You are right. It’s a good idea.” He replied. Then Merko made contact with the counselor and said: “Mr. Mirov, I need help. I would like to find a way to penetrate the information system of the Council and discover where the ship Science II is.” “I’ll see what I can do.” The counselor confirmed. As they found no signs of the boy at the University, or around Los Angeles, they all agree that there was no other way to find him without further information. They decided to wait and monitor possible communications between Nicolas and his mother, or some info about Science II. .",

As they found no signs of the boy at the University, or around Los Angeles, they all agree that there was no other way to find him without further information. They decided to wait and monitor possible communications between Nicolas and his mother, or some info about Science II. .",

      "content": "– V. Nicolas and Zara – Nicolas looked everything around him and stared at Zara. She was a beautiful and intelligent woman that had messed with his deepest feelings. Afraid that Merko might want to capture the young man, Zara decided to create an alternative plan. She would conceive a child and carry the secret of Nicolas defenses in her own body. She was also attracted by his beauty and kindness, and was determined to keep him safe. Following the orders of the King and his advisor, Kenan, was her desire. He had walked and dressed strangely, but it didn’t matter. Deep in her heart, she was touched, but she felt upset because the laws of the planet Vida didn’t allow a romantic involvement with a human being from the past. She always kept her focus on the missions, but this time the feeling was very strong. Nicolas had never been able to have a girlfriend. When he met a girl he liked, he started to talk about the stars and always included some scientific explanation in his conversations. They ended up leaving him alone. Zara also had problems in finding a good man from her planet. When she saw someone new, she kept scanning their minds and hearts, to see if something attracted her, and, in most cases, she felt that they were superficial in their ideas romantic goals. *** Drako contacted the advisor Kenan, that warned him that commander Merko was already in Los Angeles. Then he approached the other crew members and reported: “Commander Sivoc, the Challenge I is already on Earth and Merko and his team are searching the city of Los Angeles. What should we do?” “Sooner or later, he’ll discover where you are. We need a strategy. We cannot hide the ship from Merko.” Sivoc replied. Listening to the information about the imminent danger, Zara began to feel palpitations on her heart. Fear rose through her spine and she began to sweat cold, her forehead becoming wet. The others looked at each other for a moment, worried. Even the tips of her fingers were pulsing, and she felt so many sensations that she could hardly think of anything. Suddenly she couldn’t swallow and thought that something terrible would happen. Nicolas looked at her, she was pale and her body was under severe stress. After a few minutes she began to demonstrate control of the situation and even seemed to enjoy the adrenaline circulating in her body. Gradually, she was getting back to normal. Nicolas was impressed with the changes in the doctor’s behavior: “What happened to you?” “Never mind, Nick. This happens to me once in a while. In the beginning, I got scared and panicked, but now I know that nothing will happen and I actually enjoy the temporary sensation of energy that provides me. It’s an anxiety crisis. I got nervous knowing that Merko is so close. Everyone knows he’s very successful in his missions.” “The humans from Earth also experience these kinds of reactions, especially in stressful situations.” The boy replied. “This is a reaction to the release of neurotransmitters into the bloodstream, just like the attack and defense against the dangers of our ancestors who hunted and lived in caves. These are our psychic and animal identities mixed with the evolution. This reaction, which could even paralyze many humans, is just another obstacle, even for the most evolved beings, to be overcome with our emotional growth.” Zara added. “I thought these psychological problems, such as anxiety crisis and depression, didn’t exist in the future.” Nick said. “The human mind is a great source of learning. Individuals have to live their own emotions. Of course we have problems in the future that are the results of our choices and decisions in life. In our ship, we have medications for all kinds of physical and psychological disorders, however, in this case the best remedy is to learn to use our own thoughts to deal with the conflicts and try to solve them.” Zara concluded. “How can I be close to a woman so beautiful from such a different land? She’s the most beautiful woman I ever saw. How can she be from another planet but still being a human being? And besides it all she’s so smart!” Reflected Nicolas. He was confused, but he was completely charmed and bewitched by her; the scent of jasmine made him curious, because he liked the fragrance and always felt it when she was. The two of them talked quietly while the other members of the crew moved away to the other side of the room. “I approached you first, with the purpose of having a child, but our meeting was so exciting that and after all I could not stop thinking about you. With you by my side, despite our age difference, I am 32 years old, I feel like a young woman full of dreams and hopes. The feelings that we have in our hearts remain the same, in the past and also in the future.” With these words, Nicolas felt a chill and asked: “But why having my child?” “I came to you because I needed to take your genetic code with me. If you didn’t come with me, there would be a second chance for Princess Isadora.” “Everything seemed so real, but now... I feel I was nothing but a mission!” he said. “Please, don’t you ever think that! When I met you, I felt something very deep in my soul. What I did was for love, first for you, then for the princess of my world. But if something serious happened, I needed to have another plan to save little Isadora’s and that’s why I decided to get pregnant.” “Are... you pregnant?” “Yes! I already can feel it inside of me. Deep in my gut. And... I feel happy for the opportunity to be a mother.” Her words radiated, like something he never felt before. She had fallen in love with him. And he didn’t know if he wanted to protect himself from something so beautiful. But how could he feel in love with someone from another planet, whose appearance weren’t real? Many secrets about Nicola’s past would be revealed and he would understand why he fell in love with Zara. She continued to speak: “Although I’m taking the stem cells from our son, we’d also like you to go with us to guarantee the solution of our problem. We think that making a transplant of your bone marrow is the best way to save princess Isadora.” Now Nicolas was afraid to be separated from this beautiful and unique woman. He wanted to help in whatever they needed, but he couldn’t lose her, once he had found her, just like as a grain of gold in the desert. He placed his right hand over hers. Zara looked at Sivoc and saw that he was talking to Tibor and Drako. She gently pulled her hand. “Will you come with me? If you do, I’ll do anything for you.” He said. “My dear Nick, I have my life on my planet, my job, my mission, my parents and my brothers. I don’t know if I would able to live away from them, and there’s another problem. The laws of my planet forbid a person to have a relationship with humans from the past in the missions we perform.” “Please, just think about it. You’re not on your planet and we are thousands of light-years away from it. Look at what I’m doing! I’m also leaving my family to go to a place that I don’t know, putting my trust on you.” Zara didn’t expect that this short time relationship messed so much with her mind. Nicolas didn’t understand where he found so many words and feelings when he spoke to her. He soon realized that he was in love with an alien woman. Sivoc decided to interrupt their conversation and requested: “Zara, come with me to the clinic. We need to talk.” Once there, he began to say: “I know that at first you planned to take a child with the genetic code with you, however, you know that we’re not allowed to have any kid of romantic relationships with our ancestors. This is against the ethics of our mission.” “Commander, I don’t really know what’s happening, or even what will be the consequences. However, I got pregnant from because the counselor Kenan requested. His friendship with King Zadora II is so great that he put the life of Princess Isadora above all. I’m a little confused about what I feel for Nicolas. But I’ll try to solve this situation.” Zara said with an aching heart. “We can’t allow a loving union between people of different eras. This could change the future and create temporal paradoxes, and the consequences are unpredictable. I’ve seen some emotional involvement in your acts. Why using an alternative plan when taking him would already solve the problem?” Asked the commander. “Commander, if we have any problem and we can’t transplant the bone marrow, the cells will be taken from the umbilical cord of the child that I carry. Thus, this plan is another guarantee for the success of the mission. This idea came from the counselor Kenan and it was in secret between us, so no one knew until I could achieve it. We have to keep it as a secret.” Sivoc was satisfied because the alternative plan was auspicious and, besides, was made by chief of the mission. *** Back in the control room, Sivoc talks with his fellows about the future: “In a few weeks there will be a gap in space-time, with a new gravitational cycle, and it will be positioned precisely between the planets Jupiter and Vida. We can make a perfect trip back to our planet.” The waiting time made Tibor concerned about the training of the earthling for a possible fight against Merko’s team, so he said: “We need to be alert and prepared for Merko’s arrival. He will save no efforts to take Nicolas with him. I’m thinking of training the earthling so that he can defend himself against a possible attack. Do you agree, Nick?” He asked. “Certainly, especially because I don’t see any other way.” He laughed. “I’ll always be by your side.” Zara told him. “We have many ways to defend ourselves, but the crew Challenge is very well trained.” Then, they understood that it was necessary to prepare Nicolas for Merko’s arrival because the waiting time until the gap was open would be long. *** The Counselor Mirov was monitoring the communications of Science II with Vida and had intercepted the message from the advisor Kenan. Mirov contacted Merko and said: “Commander Merko, the girl won’t survive for too long without proper treatment. King Zador is very affected by the situation. We need to help him because the Council has yet to decide what will be done in case the king become unable to govern, because of his daughter’s illness. Everyone knows how much he cares for her.” “Certainly, with another loss, the King will fall into a deep depression. My chances of governing will be big if we execute this mission. I need my plan to work so I can stand out among the members of the Royal Council.” The counselor thought. “We managed to intercept a communication from the ship and Sivoc.” “Please, give me the coordinates.” Merko asked. “Radof still didn’t manage to establish precisely where the signal came from. But, according to him, in a few hours it will be possible to get this information. Wait for my contact.” “Yes, Mr. Advisor! We’re anxiously waiting.” Answered the commander. *** In a meeting, the crew of the ship Science II agreed that some other measures would be necessary for the survival of the human. “We could put a chip in Nicolas and he can turn into one of us, including voice, movements and knowledge about space technology, self-defense and fly our ships!” Drako said. “So, he would have the information about interplanetary travel acquired during these thousands years.” Tibor came walking toward them and said: “We’d add all the theories of combat in this cybernetic implantation. Then we’ll proceed with your training. Someone needs to teach this kid how to defend himself from the dangers that are about to come. I’d love to do it!” “What you think about it, Nicholas?” Zara asked. “Will I learn to read minds like you do?” “Yes, but you’ll have to make some adjustments on your mind, and you’ll also know the main techniques of fight. Tibor will train you.” “I’m a little scared. Do you believe things can go wrong?” “My dear Nick, I’ll take care of you personally. I’m an specialist in this type of surgery.” Zara replied smiling carefully. Nicolas smiled in return. He was curious to use the technology of his new friends, and learning how to fight was a privilege for a young man. And they began to make the preparations for the procedure to implant the chips in Nicolas. Zara used a pistol with a sedative in his arm in order to him relax. Then gave him an anesthetic and put him on the operating table. The capsule with a chip was inserted in the brain, between the union of the frontal bone and the two parietal bones beneath the scalp, reaching the region of the brain responsible for the control of the thoughts. This would improve his vision, hearing, and smell, intellectual and cognitive abilities. An implant of another chip in the hippocampus has been done to improve and multiply his memory. A few hours later, the boy woke up and thought: “It seems that many things have changed in my head. Everything I see brings me more information.” Zara began to explain to him about the procedures: “We put in your iris the ability of genetic transmutation. You can become one of us when you need. For this, you’ll use these special glasses, which when placed in your eyes, will activate your transformation.” She looked at his reactions when she talked, he was a little scared, but willing to live the experience. “On the right side there is a red button, which when it’s pressed activates the transformation.” The glasses were black and he kept them carefully in his pocket, anxiously waiting to use them. The boy began to realize that he knew the mechanism of functioning of all the things that he looked at and touched. His mind had become faster. In the first moments he seemed a little confused, and didn’t understand what the others were saying. He stopped, fixed his eyes on the things and scrutinized their contents and then he came back to be himself. He smiled and felt the power that the knowledge provided to him. Now it was time to return to the social world and prepare him for the difficult days that were about to come. Zara put her hand on Nicolas’ right hand. He took him to the front of the ship and tried to help him: “Don’t worry about so many changes, Nick. I will stand by your side to help you to. Better than to know how to fight is the knowledge that can help you find solutions to unusual problems.” Tibor also gave Nicolas a watch that was able to teleport him directly to the ship or any other place on Earth. A blue selector of light indicated the ship and the selected the latitude and longitude of the place coordinates. After the first transport, the instrument created a memory that was subsequently selected with a single touch. Then, Tibor began to train him expecting some possible problems facing the commander Merko and his staff, experts in many fights. .",

      "content": "– VI. The Almost Ordinary Life in New York – The aliens from Science II continued to plan how to hide until the day they would return to their planet. Sivoc knew that Merko would find their ship and, therefore, together with the team he decided that it would be safer to leave the ship and just move to New York, a city with a large number of inhabitants. They were trying to hide among so many people. Sivoc rented an apartment next to Madison Square Garden, on 8th Avenue, and the four aliens decided to wait there, together with the earthling, for the right moment to teleport themselves to the ship and make the journey back home. The commandant asked everyone to go out as little as possible. Drako entered the terrestrial identification systems, and they all received new identities. *** At night, on a Friday, Zara and Nicolas went to the movies. In the sky, a full moon created an atmosphere and made them even closer. He saw only her beauty that attracted him from the first time, and he didn’t want to think that soon things could change. The two of them were walking through the Central Park when Zara held his hand and said: “Nicolas, I don’t know if we should have a relationship like this.” “But, Zara, nothing matters more to me than being by your side, here or anywhere.” And soon he touched her lips, kissing her and tasting all the honey that came from her mouth. The trees around them covered the path with the leaves that autumn left, and the fresh air was the best he had ever breathed. They decided to watch a romantic movie, since Zara never saw that like humans on Earth. On the planet Vida everything was planned and artificial compared to the kind of life she was experiencing. When the movie finished, they returned to the apartment. Zara was worried about the commander’s reaction but the desire was stronger. She remembered the times they met the hut and her need to be near him. Besides, Sivoc, Drako and Tibor were at the city, and that was the perfect opportunity for the two them to stay together. Nicolas prepared a plate with many and took to Zara’s bed in a cozy room in the apartment. He also opened a bottle of red wine and served it to his beloved one. Before eating, he touched her red hair and kissed her, feeling the heat of her body. “You like to feel different flavors at the same time.” Zara teased. “Despite the divine taste of this wine, I still prefer the taste of the honey in your mouth.” Nicolas whispered. He lay down beside her and touched the white skin of her shoulders. He kissed her neck removing, with his fingers, the soft hair from her blue eyes. He kissed her full lips and looked at her briefly, like a male hypnotizes his female. Zara’s movements showed her sensuality and fragility. Nicolas put aside his shyness and feeling once again the scent of jasmine; he pulled the strap of her lilac blouse and undressed her. For few times in his life he felt excited and absolutely happy. Zara also reached her release felt a thrill that this time everything was different. She didn’t have to stop, because she felt pleasure and comfort with a sense of reward for being next to him. They smiled and lived one of the happiest nights of their lives. “I love you!” She confessed, whispering in his ear. “I want to live my life beside you. I love you too.” After making love without feeling thinking about the time, Zara lay down over Nicolas, and they slept embraced throughout the entire night. *** Meanwhile, the three aliens walked through the city streets. At night, there were many open bars and they decided to go into one of them. A neon light at the entrance announced the name of the bar: Night Drink Bar. Sivoc wore jeans and brown leather coat. Tibor and Drako wore black leather jackets. When they entered the bar, all the customers looked at them because they were tall and handsome. It didn’t took long until three pretty women sat at the table with them: “Can we join you?” One of them asked. “As you wish.” Drako said, smiling. “You are outsiders, aren’t you? You act different from the people that live here in town.” Said the nicest of the three women, Sonja. “We came from a land very far away. We’re just stopping by.” Sivoc said. “If you want, we can show you the most beautiful places here.” Sonja replied. Tibor took a double shot of whiskey in a single gulp. Drako did the same and told the others: “Wow! This drink is really good. I’ll ask have another one.” “Take it easy. We can’t be distracted because Merko may appear at any moment. Don’t forget we are on a mission.” Sivoc also replied using telepathy. The three men from the planet Vida continued to have fun that night and dated the women. The music was pleasant and they decided to enjoy that evening at the bar. Drako and Tibor were distracted and relaxed, impressed by how the humans of that time were able to have fun. Sivoc also enjoyed the night, but remained very alert. *** Nicolas was training with Tibor all kinds of fights daily. Although he had the theories in his mind, he also needed to train his body and acquire physical fitness, to harmonize his body and learn how to dominate his inner energy. They attended a Martial Arts Academy on the 5th Avenue every morning. From the first exercises, in a few days he already showed a good physical performance and managed to practice his teachings with others at the gym. One day, one the teachers named Alex, who since the beginning had shown some animosity towards Nick called him for a fight, and he was unable to resist the invitation. Tibor didn’t interrupt, because he thought his student needed to be tested. The teacher hit him, but the boy began to feel that he knew which places to hit in the opponent’s body and didn’t hesitate. Alex was very good with his legs and arms and defended himself very well. The fight was difficult, and Nicolas thought about how he could knock him down. Without hesitation, he grabbed the arms of his opponent, and using the boost of his strength threw him to the ground. Soon, he jumped to immobilize him and hugged his neck to perform an arm lock, naked choke and managed to finish the blow. That was when Alex quickly hit his leg three times, giving up the fight. So, Nicolas apologized and offered his hand to lift him up. “Yeah, master Tibor, your student learns fast and is using the right arm and the arm lock very easily, very good.” Said the astonished teacher. After noticing that the earthling was very advanced in the techniques, Tibor decided to take him to a desert place for them to practice in harsh environment using the best weapons they possessed. From that day, the two pressed their watches and teleported themselves to a deserted place in the Grand Canyon, in the state of Arizona. They trained in the gym and then went to the desert every day. Tibor taught him how to use weapons and a spear, which was formed from some kind of pen that was unfolded, with two ends of the laser beams. There was a laser pistol and a ring of sound waves that was used to unbalance the opponent, and also a baton that released cosmic rays towards its targets. These were very powerful weapons. The essence of Tibor’s training was to show his student that the most important thing in the art of combat training was to maintain the honor, character and selflessness.",

      "content": "– VI. The Almost Ordinary Life in New York – The aliens from Science II continued to plan how to hide until the day they would return to their planet. Sivoc knew that Merko would find their ship and, therefore, together with the team he decided that it would be safer to leave the ship and just move to New York, a city with a large number of inhabitants. They were trying to hide among so many people. Sivoc rented an apartment next to Madison Square Garden, on 8th Avenue, and the four aliens decided to wait there, together with the earthling, for the right moment to teleport themselves to the ship and make the journey back home. The commandant asked everyone to go out as little as possible. Drako entered the terrestrial identification systems, and they all received new identities. *** At night, on a Friday, Zara and Nicolas went to the movies. In the sky, a full moon created an atmosphere and made them even closer. He saw only her beauty that attracted him from the first time, and he didn’t want to think that soon things could change. The two of them were walking through the Central Park when Zara held his hand and said: “Nicolas, I don’t know if we should have a relationship like this.” “But, Zara, nothing matters more to me than being by your side, here or anywhere.” And soon he touched her lips, kissing her and tasting all the honey that came from her mouth. The trees around them covered the path with the leaves that autumn left, and the fresh air was the best he had ever breathed. They decided to watch a romantic movie, since Zara never saw that like humans on Earth. On the planet Vida everything was planned and artificial compared to the kind of life she was experiencing. When the movie finished, they returned to the apartment. Zara was worried about the commander’s reaction but the desire was stronger. She remembered the times they met the hut and her need to be near him. Besides, Sivoc, Drako and Tibor were at the city, and that was the perfect opportunity for the two them to stay together.

      "content": "– VII. The Danger is Near – Nicolas and Zara took a Saturday afternoon off and went for a in the Central Park. At this day, several famous actors were preparing to perform in a play outdoors. It was a normal thing for the New Yorkers and tourists to wait in queues for hours to watch the show. As they walked hand in hand, he looked at Zara and suggested: “What if we watched this play? The author is a famous English writer of the sixteenth century, William Shakespeare.” “I loved the idea.” Zara replied. “But we have to wait in this long line because I heard someone saying that people got here early in the morning.” “No problem. In your company I don’t notice the changes on the clock. I’ll let Sivoc know that we’ll arrive a little later tonight.” Zara got in touch with the commander so he wouldn’t be worried and explained they would watch a play at the park. Sivoc asked them to be careful and avoid any kind of problem. The couple stood in line with the people who waited anxiously for the start of the event, in an open-air amphitheater, in the middle of the park that had become a local tradition. Nicolas bought ice cream for the two of them, and they spend the nice moments together. They watched the play and after the show, were walking quietly, when Zara said: “Nick, we need to go back. It’s very late.” Nicolas loved when she called him Nick; he thought that it was a loving way of Zara calling him. “Are you okay, Zara?” “Not so much. I feel a little weird, but I believe I’ll get better.” She said, closing her eyes and breathing a little deeper. “Even dominating the anxiety crisis, the consequences aren’t easy to control. I’m also not feeling very well probably because of the pregnancy.” He looked deeply at her with such tenderness, although he was concerned about her condition. In fact, he wanted to protect her in every way. His hand was on hers, rubbing with his thumb on her hand. She seemed to be a strong woman, but she was fragile and he wanted to take care of her. The hours passed while they were together and it was already dark. Suddenly, three men approached them and one of them said: “Two lovebirds lost in the park, what a beautiful couple you make. Give us all your money now, without hesitation.” “Do not worry, Zara.” Nicolas said. “It’s okay.” “Now! We’re not joking, be fast.” The other boy said, pointing a gun to them. Zara held Nicola’s hand and began to sweat. Her forehead was wet and her fingers throbbed. She felt her heart beating fast and swallowed hard. This time it was difficult to stop the symptoms with her mental strength. Nicolas looked at the boy in front of him, with anger, and soon his gun began to levitate. The same happened with the weapons of the others, which were threw more than ten meters away. Then the three men began to be raised off the ground. The boy watched and lifted them up, leaving them scared and screaming. They were thrown up to the top of twenty-five meters tree, near the bridge. They stood there hanging like fruits. Zara slowly returned to normal, and then Nick said: “What was that? I’m really scared! How did you manage to pull those men as if they were feathers so high in the trees?” “It wasn’t me. I’d never be able to do this. I think you’re the one who did it!” Zara replied. “Let’s run, Nick, we can’t be seen. We need to get out of here fast. There is a subway entrance right ahead where we can hide and teleport ourselves to home.” Then, they arrived at the apartment. Zara was impressed with what she saw, because basically no one in her planet had the power of telekinesis. She only knew one person who could do that: Merko. Almost everyone knew how to use telepathy, but telekinesis was a very special skill. She heard on planet Vida that Merko was able to move objects and throw them against his opponents. Some reported that he could canalize the cosmic radiation and launch powerful rays with his hands, disintegrating his enemies. Besides, he had the ability to control the force of gravity. He had become a legend in his planet. In the comfort of the apartment, the boy continued to talk about how they escaped from the three men: “You said you believe it was me who did that. How could I? What kind of power is that?” “It’s telekinesis. The power to dominate the gravitational forces.” “Zara, you must have this power, and you can only use it in moments of high emotional tension or anger.” “No, Nick. It was you. Somehow you developed this ability. I know only one person on my planet that can do this and everyone fears him. Later we’ll have to understand this better. For me, it would be impossible to believe if I didn’t see with my own eyes. You will have to control this power, because it’s very dangerous.” “Who has this power?” “Merko, the man who’s looking for you. Do you understand now why we are so concerned about his arrival and the consequences for all of us?” The boy nodded. He was afraid because he didn’t understand the reason of his power and how he managed to use it so effectively. He was tired and looking at the doctor, he said: “I’m feeling exhausted.” “Please go rest, we need to relax, especially you. The telekinesis requires a lot of energy, even more from someone untrained like you.” Zara explained. *** Nicolas went to his room planning to sleep, although it was still a little early. Using telekinesis really had used all of his strength. Already in bed, he thought for a few moments about how much he missed his mother Lorena and his sister Sophia and he started to cry. “How will I be able to stay away from them? How long will it take until I can go back home? I miss my family. I wish I could get in touch to say that I’m okay, but I know it would only expose them to danger. Sivoc’s right, it’s better to leave them without news. I just hope they’re not suffering too much.” These and other reflections, about the family he had to leave behind, tormented him while he fell into a deep sleep. *** Zara looked at Nicolas for a moment when he was sleeping. She wondered what had happened during their walk and decided to tell her friends, who were resting in the living room. After reporting the fact to Sivoc, Drako and Tibor, the last one said: “Sure this ability is incredible, and the implant of the chips can’t be the source of this power.” “But what’s the explanation for this?” Sivoc asked. “Drako, you’re the specialist in Information Systems, would you know how to answer me?” “I don’t know anything about telekinesis. I just heard the stories about Merko’s power, as everyone in the planet. I’ve never seen how it works and, for me, it was a legend.” Drako said. “Anyway, even not knowing the origin of such force, we need to train the earthling. I’ll help him to channel this power and use it as best as possible without losing so much energy.” Everyone agreed with Tibor’s words, and Zara was glad, because with the good use of this power, he could defend himself better. Thus, she decided to tell the news about his new training when Nicolas woke up.",

      "content": "VIII. Nicolas’ Extraterrestrial Shape When he woke up, Zara told him about the necessity to learn how to use his new power. He agreed and Tibor started training him on the same day in the desert, where they went daily for heavier workouts with laser guns. Tibor asked him to move a large stone that was positioned on top of a mountain. “Nicolas, you are able to use the cosmic energies released on the planet by the stars and channel them into your body. Concentrate on this strength and have faith in your power. Let this energy flow through your guts and throw your hands against the object you want to move or destroy.” The boy did exactly what he said, focusing his mind on the stone and trying to pull the energy of the Cosmos. Although he felt a strong shaking inside his body that spread throughout his blood stream, nothing different happened. “I can’t do that again. I wasn’t the one who did it.” “Concentrate yourself and believe you’re capable. You’ll do it if you want.” Tibor replied. However, the boy couldn’t do it and he wanted to give up. His instructor insisted that it was possible and also knew that believing was the principle of any mental strength. He insisted so much that Nicolas looked at him with anger and blurted: “There’s no use in stay here trying. You’re asking too much from me, when the truth is that my life changed and I don’t know if this is what I want. I want to go back to my normal life! You’re all crazy to believe that I am able to move objects.” “Now, look again at that stone and move it.” Tibor ordered, taking advantage of the opportunity of the release of the anger he just provided. The boy looked at the stone with three meters of diameter and felt the energy circle through his body. The object began to rise from the mountain, when he raised his left hand. The stone seemed to be made of Styrofoam and with his right hand, Nicolas released a cosmic blue beam in the direction of the stone and smashed it into pieces. “Wow! Didn’t I tell you could? After using this force several times, you’ll able to master it, and this will make part of your life and will help you to defend the dangers that are about to come.” The boy felt stronger. He understood that something quite extraordinary happened in his life and he’d have to learn to live with his new powers. *** Life in New York was quiet and they had to be very discreet not to reveal their position. Sivoc met the crew of the ship, including Nicolas, who the captain already saw as part of his team. The confrontation with Merko should be imminent they had to discuss the strategy. Would a confrontation be better? “What is it, Commander?” Tibor asked. “I received a message from our planet telling me that Merko already has information about our location. I believe that there’s no other way to deal with his team but face them, they always managed to get to their targets.” Sivoc replied. “I’m sure we can fight against them, I’m going to prepare the earthling to defend himself and we all have knowledge of self-defense.” Tibor said. “I still think we’d better try to escape, because this fight is dangerous and we can all die. Maybe we can hide ourselves; we’ll have enough time until the day of our trip back home.” Zara said. “I’ll try to find out whatever I can about the location of Merko’s ship.” Drako interrupted. “Things seem to be more difficult for us. Kenan said that probably there is a traitor among them, he discovered that someone managed to intercept our communications with the planet Vida.” “I think the best thing to do now would be to teleport ourselves to Science II, where the communication and tracking equipment is being kept. We need to contact Kenan once again and this will only be possible from there.” “Good point, Drako. I think this is the best option at the moment. Let’s all go to the ship, so no one will be caught off guard or alone here.” Sivoc agreed. “Nicolas, this is a good opportunity for you to transform yourself for the first time. You need to adapt to the new extraterrestrial form that you’ll use on the planet Vida. You’ll have to live like everyone else.” Zara said. So, they all positioned their glasses, synchronized their clocks and returned to the ship. Nicolas also had to put his transmutation glasses, which he had won from his extraterrestrial friends, right after the surgery. He felt as if he was one of them. He didn’t quite understand why, but he acquired a great fondness with them.” He looked through the window that reflected his forms and noticed that his large eyes had more lateral field of vision. His big brain seemed disproportionate to the rest of the body. He raised his hand and saw the three fingers that now he possessed. He stuck his tongue out and noticed it was small, suited to its oral cavity. Now he was the one who was transformed, so he got scared and wondered if he would be able to get back to his human form. He put his fingers over the nostrils, which were only two small holes. “Where are my ears? And what if the others disappear and leave me here with this form? How will I live my life like this?” He wondered. Although a few weeks have passed since his operation, Nicolas hadn’t seen his new form yet. He was appalled and amazed at the same time. He never thought that he could go through so many experiences and adventures in his life at the same time. Discovering life on other planets, state-of-the-art technologies and explanations about the evolution of mankind. He imagined that when he arrived at the planet Vida, he would certainly discover more things. *** Meanwhile, on the planet Vida, the King Zador II thought of his daughter and wanted some news about the search of the earthling on the planet Earth. He really trusted in Kenan, one of his counselors who were the son of a close friend of his father. Kenan had great confidence in Sivoc, because of his missions, always putting the value the life factor. Kenan, as per the King request decided to contact the Science II ship. At that time, all of them were already inside the ship when a red light in the holographic screen started flashing, accompanied by an intermittent beep. It was the advisor appearing on the screen.” “Someone answer please.” He said. “Listening, Lord Kenan.” Drako answered. “Did you find the earthling?” “Yes, sir. He’s under our care.” Sivoc said. “We’re waiting for the next space-time gap that should occur very soon.” “Watch out for Merko’s team. They must be close. I hope you can accomplish the mission without problems. King Zador told me that he’s hoping for the success of your team.” Kenan replied. *** Immediately Radof took the communications interceptor device to his master and they discovered the location. Within minutes, they identified exactly where the signal came from. Mirov contacted Merko informing the news about Sivoc’s ship. Merko’s intention was to capture the earthling, kidnapping him. And freeze the crew of Science II inside their ship. They would be back to the planet Vida one year after the success of the mission of Challenge I. So, they wouldn’t create problems. The danger was coming closer! *** Once they finished the contact with Kenan, the crew of Science II returned to New York. Still gathered, they discussed all the possibilities and decided that the best alternative was to remain hidden. Without detection they tried to continue the life they had in that great city. For safety, they left a recording system activated to protect them from a possible sabotage, if Merko found Science II. Little Wolf, the robot-dog was also on the ship to defend it from possible intruders. One day, Drako went to a lottery and hit the jackpot and earned a good fortune. A few days later, he went to the bank to receive it and distributed money to his friends. Everyone needed some money to survive in the planet. Sivoc, noticing what he had done, decided to question him while the others listened with attention: “Where did you get so much money, Drako?” “Sir, I researched in the past database the winning numbers from the day before yesterday and use them. I thought we could use the money to survive here in this planet. Everything here has a price.” “I believe your intentions were good, because you wanted to help us in our mission. But I don’t think that a competitive advantage over the others participants of the betting is fair. You must return what you won.” They all were surprised, and Tibor was already looking at his beautiful watch, which he bought at a store on 5th Avenue. They were embarrassed by the order of their master and in fact they knew nothing about the origin of the amounts distributed by Drako. “But, sir! I haven’t done anything wrong.” “You know that our principles about acquiring things by dishonest means. Return what you won to its real owners.” Zara decided to intercede: “Commander, it’d be better if he distributed what’s left of the amount to charity organizations, it would be difficult to explain to the lottery why he was returning the award. They could find it strange and inform the press, which would cause us a big problem. We can split a small amount for our survival here on this planet just what is necessary to fulfill our mission. If we make copies of their currency would also be a questionable mean of acquiring resources. Tomorrow we should make a deposit for an institution that supports abandoned children or a Non-governmental organization that works with refugees from wars. “Sir, I agree with Zara,” since our mission has to be discreet, distributing the proceeds for the people who needed will be the best solution, and no one will know where the resources came from. We just need to know the bank account of the NGO.” Nicolas said. “Okay. I think it’s the best decision. Do like they said, Drako. Search in the database files, which institutions are in need of financial help and their respective bank accounts. However, I don’t want you to take this kind of decision again without consulting me first.” Tibor looked at his beautiful watch and, embarrassed, asked: “Sir, how will I be able to return this watch?” “Fine. You can have this one. I wouldn’t know what to do with it. Honestly, Tibor, our teleportation watches are much more beautiful.” Sivoc replied and continued, smiling. “Besides, isn’t it heavy for your arm to use two watches?” Tibor was quiet and hid one arm behind his back with half a smile in his face. *** Nicolas wanted to be active while they waited for the day to travel to planet Vida. Reluctantly, Sivoc allowed him to find an activity. However, he was quite firm in the need for him to be discreet and to keep away from problems, to do not catch the attention especially of his enemies. This was even more critical now that they knew about the boy’s telekinetic powers, which needed to be controlled at all costs. Nicolas began working as an intern in the Laboratory of Technology Research in Gravitational Physics. He couldn’t stay away from physics, which, professionally, was what he loved the most. Working as an intern he could see the researches without disobeying the orders of the commander. On his first day of work, using the fake name of Carlos Miguelito, and ID prepared by Drako, he was cleaning one of the labs and listened with attention to the explanations of the professor of Quantum Physics, who was showing the trainees the gravitational fields of the Relativity Theory. He imagined himself as a college student asking the teacher about the evolution and the possible reaction to think that the human being would evolve into what society considered as an alien. For a few moments he stared at the board, traveling in his own thoughts: He imagined himself attending the class when he decided to ask: “Professor, have you ever wondered how would it be if the man evolved following the tendency of the brain enlargement of primates from which we descend? And the atrophy of the dental arches by changing our eating habits, reduction of the size of the fingers for the use of robotics? Absence of nails by the loss of the claw function?” “What do you mean, boy? Carlos Miguelito, right?” The teacher said: “Go ahead, I want to hear what you have to say.” “Yes, sir.” Nicolas replied. “What if, crossing the warp space-time-gravity, we could go back to the past using the modern ships, with discoid shape, to travel the universe in all directions? Have you ever imagined that flying plates can be piloted by evolved humans from the future?” “My young boy, this is impossible. You must be joking”. The professor replied smiling. He continued to laugh for a few seconds and said: “You have a very fertile imagination. Imagine if aliens were ourselves, the human beings? This is crazy.” He returned to reality, grabbed his broom and continued to clean the lab. Deep inside he wondered: “A few days ago I would agree with you. This is good, the secret of my friends are safe.”",

      "content": "VIII. Nicolas’ Extraterrestrial Shape When he woke up, Zara told him about the necessity to learn how to use his new power. He agreed and Tibor started training him on the same day in the desert, where they went daily for heavier workouts with laser guns. Tibor asked him to move a large stone that was positioned on top of a mountain. “Nicolas, you are able to use the cosmic energies released on the planet by the stars and channel them into your body. Concentrate on this strength and have faith in your power. Let this energy flow through your guts and throw your hands against the object you want to move or destroy.” The boy did exactly what he said, focusing his mind on the stone and trying to pull the energy of the Cosmos. Although he felt a strong shaking inside his body that spread throughout his blood stream, nothing different happened. “I can’t do that again. I wasn’t the one who did it.” “Concentrate yourself and believe you’re capable. You’ll do it if you want.” Tibor replied. However, the boy couldn’t do it and he wanted to give up. His instructor insisted that it was possible and also knew that believing was the principle of any mental strength. He insisted so much that Nicolas looked at him with anger and blurted: “There’s no use in stay here trying. You’re asking too much from me, when the truth is that my life changed and I don’t know if this is what I want. I want to go back to my normal life! You’re all crazy to believe that I am able to move objects.” “Now, look again at that stone and move it.” Tibor ordered, taking advantage of the opportunity of the release of the anger he just provided. The boy looked at the stone with three meters of diameter and felt the energy circle through his body. The object began to rise from the mountain, when he raised his left hand. The stone seemed to be made of Styrofoam and with his right hand, Nicolas released a cosmic blue beam in the direction of the stone and smashed it into pieces. “Wow! Didn’t I tell you could? After using this force several times, you’ll able to master it, and this will make part of your life and will help you to defend the dangers that are about to come.” The boy felt stronger. He understood that something quite extraordinary happened in his life and he’d have to learn to live with his new powers. *** Life in New York was quiet and they had to be very discreet not to reveal their position. Sivoc met the crew of the ship, including Nicolas, who the captain already saw as part of his team. The confrontation with Merko should be imminent they had to discuss the strategy. Would a confrontation be better? “What is it, Commander?” Tibor asked. “I received a message from our planet telling me that Merko already has information about our location. I believe that there’s no other way to deal with his team but face them, they always managed to get to their targets.” Sivoc replied. “I’m sure we can fight against them, I’m going to prepare the earthling to defend himself and we all have knowledge of self-defense.” Tibor said. “I still think we’d better try to escape, because this fight is dangerous and we can all die. Maybe we can hide ourselves; we’ll have enough time until the day of our trip back home.” Zara said. “I’ll try to find out whatever I can about the location of Merko’s ship.” Drako interrupted. “Things seem to be more difficult for us. Kenan said that probably there is a traitor among them, he discovered that someone managed to intercept our communications with the planet Vida.” “I think the best thing to do now would be to teleport ourselves to Science II, where the communication and tracking equipment is being kept. We need to contact Kenan once again and this will only be possible from there.” “Good point, Drako. I think this is the best option at the moment.

He stuck his tongue out and noticed it was small, suited to its oral cavity. Now he was the one who was transformed, so he got scared and wondered if he would be able to get back to his human form.

      "content": "– IX. The Alpha-Omega Team – At one night, everyone was watching television. The Anchor of the TV news was talking about the episode that happened at the Multinational Space Station: “A few days ago, the radar of the Multinational Space Station recorded the presence of an UFO near our planet. Later another unknown ship also invaded our airspace leaving all countries on alert. The worldwide intelligence agencies are investigating the case.” “That episode occurred with the detection of our presence. We must avoid any situation that may expose us.” Sivoc declared. Zara spoke again about the episode in the park: “Commander, I’m still afraid about that day when Nicolas and I were walking in the Central Park and the gang attacked us. Don’t you think that the event will draw attention? Maybe someone saw what happened.” “Not even on our planet, with all the psychic evolution is easy to find someone who has the ability to use telekinesis. They say that only the commander Merko owns such power. It seems that his mind can emit electromagnetic waves capable of modifying the gravitational field around the objects and even to manipulate the energies contained in the molecules of the environment.” Sivoc affirmed. “What happened can put our mission at risk. In this case, you acted in self-defense. This power, maybe it was caused because of the implantation of the chip we performed in the boy. However, this situation is fantastic. You are right this can attract agents that capture aliens in this planet. Imagine if they put their hands in our ship, laser guns, sunglasses, transformation and teleportation watches... Logically, they will use reverse engineering to advance technologically.” *** But it was too late. The Alpha-Omega government team, specialized in extraterrestrial affairs, had moved to the center of space control. A couple of agents were in charge of the case, Collin Netil and Ann Soliver. They talked about the fact that was leaked to the entire press: “Agent Netil, some aspects surprise me in this case. Why two ships would appear in the space within a few days? Are they still here on Earth?” “We’ll request a report of all occurrences to the FBI and ask for information from the governments of other countries. Ann, I believe we have a great case of alien presence to investigate. Imagine if we can put our hands on these extraterrestrials equipment and capture some specimens to study?” The team members decided to make a report about what had happened. Besides studying the cases of extraterrestrial appearances on the planet, one of the major purposes of the organization was to capture the visitors, make biological researches on them and possibly analyze and assimilate their technologies with the intention of acquiring scientific and military knowledge. “Where are their ships? Are they already infiltrated among us? We need to map the entire planet and use all available radar systems to locate them. We have so many doubts about this case.” Agent Soliver said. As soon as they requested the police reports, which showed abnormal happenings, they received information about the incident in Central Park and the unusual way his tormentors hanged them on a tree. The men reported in testimony that a couple made them levitate as well as their weapons and escaped. When the Agent Collin Netil received the email, he immediately ordered: “Get the experts to make a total scan at the scene. We’ll record all the testimonies and make a throughout survey. Check if there were cameras in the area. Our chief will love this case.” When they reached the place, a team of the federal police investigators was already working on the case. Thompson, from the FBI, went to Agent Netil and to Agent Soliver and said: “Who are you and how did you enter into a restricted area of investigation?” Collin showed his badge: NETIL, COLLIN FEDERAL AGENT – LEVEL 1 ALPHA OMEGA TEAM – PENTAGON “Never heard of such agents in our government! I’ll call the Federal Bureau of investigation. Wait a minute, please.” Immediately he called and confirmed that this organization was directly tied to the General Staff of the National Security Forces, of course he allowed their presence onto their investigations. The agents finished the report and took it to the chief who was anxiously waiting for some relevant information. He was an old man, about 67 years old, with a mustache and gray hair, calm and with a rough voice. He was already retired, but still worked and was passionate about such issues. Because of his experience, the government allowed him to continue accompanying this type of case. It was a strategic advantage. His name was Ronald Steighen. He was intimately familiar with issues related to his agency, he had already captured and studied several alien specimens and to work there was his greatest pleasure. “Sir, here is the report with our primary conclusions about the case.” Collin said. “This ET wants to become a warrior of justice to confront criminals. If we’re lucky, he’ll appear again. And his will to do justice will be its Achilles’ heel, the weakness which will make us catch him.” Ann pronounced. Ronald looked at the report and analyzed each sentence: “This is not a specimen easy to be caught. It is well trained and knows how to use his weapons. He raised his victims into the air with ease. Create a profile of our ET. Let’s wait for his movements and identify him; we need to study his area of expertise, physical space, modus operandi, relationships and weaknesses. We know that they can turn into human beings like us. I already found one of them more than twenty years ago. He had this power to move objects. Is he back?” “Chief, I’d like you to tell us this story. It may be relevant in this case.” “I’ll tell it at another time. He nearly destroyed an entire military base and even managed to escape. I don’t like to talk about it. You’ll have to use intelligence and surprise factor. They are made of flesh and blood. We’ve already managed to capture and take some of them to the military base in Arizona. In another occasion I’ll tell all the details, but now we don’t have time. We need to capture them. I want a report about the investigations.” “Chief, there were no cameras in the crime scene. We only have testimonies of people who saw the action and they are defending the alien.” Colin reported. Make a sketch and place it in all the police stations as national security priority. Surely we’ll catch him.” Ronald spoke, punching the table. “Agent Soliver, scan the blocks near the place and put undercover agents at strategic points. I want to know every detail related to this case, did you hear? Anything! One more thing: Use these special infrared glasses, because when they are transmuted into terrestrial form, they emit radiation that can be perceived with the use of these optical devices.” *** The building of the newspaper “The Los Angeles’ Voice was located only two blocks ahead from where the Alfa-Omega was based. The chief editor, Albert Dither, was walking from one side to the other, waiting for his best journalist to return from the reporting about the case of the gang in New York, who had been levitated in a tree by an unknown couple. “Would he be a Special Forces soldier, who coincidentally was in that place?” His thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of reporter Andrew Thomas. “Sir, I got some information about the case. It’s not much more than what was published in the newspapers. It seems that they used a special kind of antigravity technology.” “Look for this kid and the woman who was with him. Come on, I need more information about this event. I see a great headline!” Dither said. “Chief, you must be joking. If we announce the presence of aliens, the credibility of our newspaper will drop to zero.” “But if we get the evidences, the effect can be better than expected. Have you ever thought of the possibility that we can prove the alien presence here on Earth?” “Yes, sir. Now I understand why you managed to become the chief. To go after unprecedented and fantastic news has always been your ideal. I’ll look for evidences with my team. Soon I’ll return with the results.”",

Imagine if we can put our hands on these extraterrestrials equipment and capture some specimens to study?” The team members decided to make a report about what had happened. Besides studying the cases of extraterrestrial appearances on the planet, one of the major purposes of the organization was to capture the visitors, make biological researches on them and possibly analyze and assimilate their technologies with the intention of acquiring scientific and military knowledge. “Where are their ships? Are they already infiltrated among us? We need to map the entire planet and use all available radar systems to locate them. We have so many doubts about this case.” Agent Soliver said. As soon as they requested the police reports, which showed abnormal happenings, they received information about the incident in Central Park and the unusual way his tormentors hanged them on a tree. The men reported in testimony that a couple made them levitate as well as their weapons and escaped. When the Agent Collin Netil received the email, he immediately ordered: “Get the experts to make a total scan at the scene. We’ll record all the testimonies and make a throughout survey. Check if there were cameras in the area. Our chief will love this case.” When they reached the place, a team of the federal police investigators was already working on the case. Thompson, from the FBI, went to Agent Netil and to Agent Soliver and said: “Who are you and how did you enter into a restricted area of investigation?” Collin showed his badge: NETIL, COLLIN FEDERAL AGENT – LEVEL 1 ALPHA OMEGA TEAM – PENTAGON “Never heard of such agents in our government! I’ll call the Federal Bureau of investigation. Wait a minute, please.” Immediately he called and confirmed that this organization was directly tied to the General Staff of the National Security Forces, of course he allowed their presence onto their investigations. The agents finished the report and took it to the chief who was anxiously waiting for some relevant information. He was an old man, about 67 years old, with a mustache and gray hair, calm and with a rough voice. He was already retired, but still worked and was passionate about such issues. Because of his experience, the government allowed him to continue accompanying this type of case. It was a strategic advantage. His name was Ronald Steighen. He was intimately familiar with issues related to his agency, he had already captured and studied several alien specimens and to work there was his greatest pleasure. “Sir, here is the report with our primary conclusions about the case.” Collin said. “This ET wants to become a warrior of justice to confront criminals. If we’re lucky, he’ll appear again. And his will to do justice will be its Achilles’ heel, the weakness which will make us catch him.” Ann pronounced. Ronald looked at the report and analyzed each sentence: “This is not a specimen easy to be caught. It is well trained and knows how to use his weapons. He raised his victims into the air with ease. Create a profile of our ET. Let’s wait for his movements and identify him; we need to study his area of expertise, physical space, modus operandi, relationships and weaknesses. We know that they can turn into human beings like us. I already found one of them more than twenty years ago. He had this power to move objects. Is he back?” “Chief, I’d like you to tell us this story. It may be relevant in this case.” “I’ll tell it at another time. He nearly destroyed an entire military base and even managed to escape. I don’t like to talk about it. You’ll have to use intelligence and surprise factor. They are made of flesh and blood. We’ve already managed to capture and take some of them to the military base in Arizona. In another occasion I’ll tell all the details, but now we don’t have time. We need to capture them. I want a report about the investigations.” “Chief, there were no cameras in the crime scene. We only have testimonies of people who saw the action and they are defending the alien.” Colin reported. Make a sketch and place it in all the police stations as national security priority. Surely we’ll catch him.” Ronald spoke, punching the table. “Agent Soliver, scan the blocks near the place and put undercover agents at strategic points. I want to know every detail related to this case, did you hear? Anything! One more thing: Use these special infrared glasses, because when they are transmuted into terrestrial form, they emit radiation that can be perceived with the use of these optical devices.” *** The building of the newspaper “The Los Angeles’ Voice was located only two blocks ahead from where the Alfa-Omega was based. The chief editor, Albert Dither, was walking from one side to the other, waiting for his best journalist to return from the reporting about the case of the gang in New York, who had been levitated in a tree by an unknown couple. “Would he be a Special Forces soldier, who coincidentally was in that place?” His thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of reporter Andrew Thomas. “Sir, I got some information about the case. It’s not much more than what was published in the newspapers. It seems that they used a special kind of antigravity technology.” “Look for this kid and the woman who was with him. Come on, I need more information about this event. I see a great headline!” Dither said. “Chief, you must be joking. If we announce the presence of aliens, the credibility of our newspaper will drop to zero.” “But if we get the evidences, the effect can be better than expected. Have you ever thought of the possibility that we can prove the alien presence here on Earth?” “Yes, sir. Now I understand why you managed to become the chief. To go after unprecedented and fantastic news has always been your ideal. I’ll look for evidences with my team. Soon I’ll return with the results.”",

      "content": "– X. The Sky and the Stars – When they discovered the location of the Science II, Merko and his team teleported themselves to their ship in Alaska and go directly to the deep of the oceans. During the trip the commander Merko sat in a chair on the ship and began to remember his last mission on Earth, exactly twenty-three years ago on the Earth calendar. He came to the planet with his friend Silion to test the space folds and the possibility of time travel. They were flying over Canada and the United States, before landing on the secret base in Alaska. During this flight, they were intercepted by the U.S. Air Force, which captured his friend in order to make experiments and study. That memory made him sad. He could still hear in his mind, repeatedly, a conversation with his friend shortly before the incident. “Merko, when we return to our planet I intend to live in peace with my wife and my two sons. This life keeps me away from the people I love most. It’s time to stop.” “I can’t believe you’re willing to retire, Silion.” Merko replied smiling. He felt his heart aching, and tears came to his eyes. The memories made him miss his friend from the bottom of his heart. There was a self-destruct mechanism created by the scientists of the planet Vida. All the time travelers were equipped with a heart and brain paralyzing substance, activated by electrical and hormonal waves of thought. In a situation of imminent threat they needed to focus their thoughts in death for three minutes and it would occur. Everyone who traveled to the past, especially to the planet Earth, received an implant with a chip that released this substance, so, when captured they weren’t used in experiments or delivered their military, technological or scientific knowledge. The discovery of such knowledge could provide harmful consequences for human beings, altering the story by changing the Earth’s past. *** Every night, Nicolas loved to walk with Zara around the streets of New York, such as the 5th and Madison Avenue. They walked arm in arm, like an ordinary couple. She hadn’t mentioned anything about with him on Earth again, and he preferred to let everything happen naturally, although, sometimes he felt anxious for her decision. On a Friday night, they stopped and sat on a bench to talk. Zara looked at the stars and said: “Nicolas, do you like to look at the stars?” “I like it, but when we went up with the ship, I could see the Earth from above and this was one of the most beautiful things I had seen. It’s all so magnificent and I thought how small we are.” He said, very close to her. He was so happy around her and talking about something he loved. “And to think that although the Milky Way has thousands of stars, planet Earth is placed in a solar system, located right in the “Arm of Orion”. The Sun is a star considered of fifth magnitude. The Alnilam star is six times greater than the Sun. The Antares star is three hundred and eight times larger than the Sun, and the Betelgeuse star is five hundred ninety-one times larger than the Earth’s Sun.” Zara said, with her face looking up. Her eyes were shining. “Do you have astronauts?” “The word ‘astronaut’ means traveler of the stars, but the moon is the farthest place to which man traveled in your time, so far. All of us, on our planet, are trained since youth in the astronomical sciences, because space and time travels are needed.” “And what about the black holes, do you have knowledge of them?” Nicolas asked, hugging her. “In the midst of our galaxies, and many others, there is probably a black hole, with approximately four million solar masses. That is what keeps the galaxy uniform. We aren’t sucked into them because of the rotation of the galaxy, as we are not sucked into the sun, because the translation of the Earth. The rotation of the solar system around the core of the Milky Way has a period of two hundred million years. It is believed that the black hole is a very dense body mass with large gravitational energy, and that not even light is able to escape it. That’s why he is black, because it has no light. It’s sucked to its gravity.” They remained silence for some time, watching the sky, feeling the sensation that the beautiful night was offering. The wind blew gently on their faces. “That’s how galaxies and planets work. Everyone needs to be on the move to keep their orbits and avoid being sucked by their suns, black holes and translational centers.” The doctor explained. “This galaxy, the Milky Way, performs rotational movements around itself, bringing the small galaxies into its orbit, while it rotates around its own core.” “This knowledge about outer space makes it so beautiful, that is easy to feel humble looking at it. A thousand years ago, the human being would find it impossible to use computers, cell phones, aircrafts, submarines and many other appliances and machines, which are routine in the present time. So when you get to planet Vida, you’ll see how we have are evolved. But for you, Nicolas, who studies physics, everything will be wonderful, especially our relationship with the environment and the new forms of energy.” They continued to look at the stars in the sky and tears flowed from Zara’s eyes. She missed her family and her home, which was so distant in her galaxy. Nicolas promptly wiped her tears with a handkerchief and asked her: “What is it, dear? What makes you cry?” “I’m remembering of my loved ones, in my planet.” Answered her, willing to disguise how much she missed them. This made Nicolas thought how painful would it be for her to have to move away from her world to live her life beside him. Trying not to be sad by her memories, she continued to talk about the stars: “Here in the northern hemisphere sky, we can clearly see my galaxy, M31, in the Andromeda constellation. You can also see the Ursa Major constellation, with seven major stars, that one with a square and a tail to the left side. Watch it.” She said looking up with attention, snuggling in the arms of Nicolas. She could feel the heart of her beloved pounding and knew that, deep inside, one day they could be happy, if it wasn’t for the difference between their worlds. “How beautiful is the immensity of the sky, especially on a night like this.” Added the boy. “That’s the constellation Ursa Minor, with a square, a tail facing up, and the star Polaris in the top, indicating north. But, in the southern hemisphere, there are also very beautiful stars.” “We could synchronize our watches and go to some country of the South America and to enjoy the night.” He suggested. His young and wild spirit together with the curiosity of knowing his own world better, really appreciated everything together with Zara. She was thinking about the dangers of moving away from the rest of the group, but thought about the moment she was living and soon agreed. “And where will we go?” She asked. “Let’s go to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Corcovado, where the Christ the Redeemer is. The view from there is amazing. They say that the landscapes of mountains mingle with the beauty of the sea creating an ecological paradise.” They synchronized their watches to the correct latitude and longitude and, in an instant, they were in the desired location. They materialized at the top of the stairs of the Christ the Redeemer, contemplating the beautiful landscape of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It didn’t take too long and they were already fixing their eyes in the southern sky. A couple who was kissing and drinking something sitting at the restaurant table, on that place during the evening, saw them appear out of nowhere, and the woman said: “Did you see what I saw? That couple came out of nowhere.” “Are they spirits or real people? Is there something wrong with our drinks?” Asked the man throwing away the beer that was in his glass. “We’d better get out of here.” Said the woman. Zara ignored the couple because she heard them say they would leave. Besides, she didn’t intend to stay there for too long. Then she began to describe the constellations of the heavens of the South American continent: “That constellation of four star in the shape of a cross is the Crux. There’s a fifth star called Intrometida, which means Intrusive in Portuguese.” “The names of the stars are Acrux, Gacrux, Mimosa, Pálida and Intrometida, which is the smaller one. The biggest part of the cross points to south and was widely used by mariners in the past.” “That’s why the Crux is part of the flags of several countries in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia, Brazil, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.” Nick commented. “Up above, we see the Three Mary’s, which are those stars aligned. They are part of Orion’s belt. The names of the stars are Mintaka, Alnilam and Alnitaka. They have a very strong light. To the North of the Three Mary’s, you can see the Betelgeuse star, and to the south, the Sirius star.” “Yeah, you know the sky of our planet very well!” He said, surprised. “It couldn’t be different, because for a traveler, to know the ways is an obligation.” Zara replied. “Besides, astronomy is a required subject in our schools.” Nicolas, in fact, was really enjoying everything he heard, while he stood staring at Zara’s blue eyes... That was the heaven he most admired. Then, slowly he began to approach his lips and kissed her deeply, at that moment, he forgot everything. He again felt the scent of jasmine that pleased him so much, and he finally decided to ask: “Zara, why do you always smell like jasmine?” “In the future, I researched a lot about you and I knew that your favorite scent was jasmine. So, I decided to use it to please you, which has always my biggest purpose.” Nicolas returned his lips toward hers. Then she put her finger on Nicolas’ lips and said: “We have to get out of here and return to New York. Our friends will be worried if we lose the contact. Let’s go, please, Nick.” Although he was happy in the company of Zara and observing the celestial firmament he admired so much, he knew it was necessary to go back. Always thinking about his mother Loraine and his beloved sister Sophia, he imagined how would they be, but he was oriented by Sivoc not to get in touch with anyone. At least for now, he couldn’t leave clues for Merko’s team. Besides, they also promised to bring Nicolas back to nearest time of his encounter with Zara in the past, when they returned from the Planet Vida. In other words, when he returned his disappearance wouldn’t be noticed by anyone. So, they synchronized their watches to return to New York. They met their friends in the apartment, where they gathered, customarily, to talk about the latest events in safety. Some drinks and food couldn’t be found on the planet Vida, which had a restricted diet of pre-made food and lots of pills. There wasn’t the same flavor provided by our foods. So, Nicolas ordered a delicious pizza, which would be accompanied by a special wine. An explosion of flavor that all aliens began to love. With each passing day, the boy introduced to his new friends all the diverse cuisine that was in the city where they were hidden. The aliens were pleased with the food and dishes of all kinds, with the gastronomy from nearly every country in the world. Those were unparalleled flavors that their palates weren’t accustomed to feel. In addition, tours to cinemas, theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainments made their visit to our planet very pleasant. This pleasure was completely new. They only knew the history of their ancestors. *** On a Sunday, Nicolas invited his friends to go to a huge amusement park that was in the city. The rollercoaster was kilometric. The boy challenged them to the adventure and everyone looked at each other nervous. Tibor said: “This is easy for me. I’ll buy five tickets.” So he ran to the box office. Zara was afraid, but decided to let the adrenaline rush. They all went to the rollercoaster and returned disheveled and agitated. Nicolas invited Zara to ride a Ferris wheel and when they were up there, he showed the beauty of the city to her, what ended up creating a romantic mood. When they stopped, they kissed with passion. It was amazing to notice the adrenaline of his lover, and also introducing her the good things of his world. He felt complete beside her and wished immensely that such moment didn’t come to an end. *** On another occasion, Nicolas took Zara to watch a movie that she enjoyed a lot. It was a novel and the meeting was very nice, with popcorn and soda, while they played and talked about nothing important. When he discovered that she liked the cinema and that her favorite movies were the romances, the boy decided he would take her to enjoy that kind of entertainment whenever possible. He knew he was somehow part of her life and that the pleasure they shared was genuine and unconditional. *** Nicolas also wanted to introduce the other beauties of our planet to Zara. “Zara, the people from your planet seem a little tense. They’re always talking about environmental destruction and degradation of the hydro resources of the Earth. Here on my planet there are many wonderful things to be done and seen. From the past to the present, humans were born, genius or not, and fought hard to turn people into what we are today. Freedom of opinion, the end of prejudice in all its forms, the search for the cure of many diseases that killed thousands of people were some of the reasons for these humans to fight so much. Revolutions in thought with great men and women who had stood out in history resulted in the achievement of equality rights and freedom of their nations. Even today, there are still fights in countries because of democracy and the basic rights of the human society. We still have many problems to solve, but there are wonderful people willing to do their part to improve our systems.” He paused for a moment, kissing her lightly on the lips and continued. “I would like to enjoy these moments we have together and take you to see other places. Then, he held Zara’s hand. They both pressed their watches and their first was at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The night was falling and the lights began to be turned on. She was dazzled by the sight and said: “What a beautiful thing, Nicolas. I didn’t know you were so romantic.” “Here in Paris we are behind the time of New York. We’ll have dinner at a restaurant on top of the tower. The view is unbelievable.” After a tasty dinner, the boy decided to make another surprise for his lover. “Honey, close your eyes, I’ll take you to another wonderful place.” So they went to the Taj Mahal Palace, one of the most popular monuments of India. The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum located in Agra, considered one of the Seven Wonders of the modern world. With their walls full of with semi-precious stones, the dome has gold strands, which impress the visitors. They say it was built to house the body of the wife of a powerful sultan of the country in which it is located. “Nicolas, it looks a bit like the Palace of the King Zador II, on my planet. It’s beautiful and magnificent, and the clothing of the people are very different from those used in other countries.” Said the doctor. “Here on Earth there are different traditions. So many races and cultures are a great opportunity for the human being to live with differences and develop their spirituality. That’s what makes our world so special.” After that, they returned to U.S.A. to meet the other members of the team. Sivoc observed with attention that Nicolas and Zara wanted to be together all the time and there was nothing more to do to prevent the relationship of the two of them. He knew there were reports in his planet about other encounters between humans of different ages and the result was unpredictable. He imagined that it was actually possible to have hybrid terrestrial beings living among children of humans and extraterrestrial beings of the future. Although they transmuted themselves to accomplish their missions, their new bodies provided a loving approximation for the people from Earth. “When love dominates the mind and heart, anything is possible. Humans will always fall in love, because this is the formula for the perpetuation of the human race.” Reflected the commander. He remembered his wife Laiza and his kids. He thought about how hard it was to conquer her because, at the time, her family didn’t allow their marriage. Since he was a traveler scientist, her parents knew she would only be able to stay with her family while her husband was on a mission. That wasn’t what they wanted to Laiza. However, now she was his great love and everything he did was for the sake of his family. Therefore, he didn’t know if he had the right to interfere in the love that was born between Zara and Nicolas.",

So, Nicolas ordered a delicious pizza, which would be accompanied by a special wine. An explosion of flavor that all aliens began to love. With each passing day, the boy introduced to his new friends all the diverse cuisine that was in the city where they were hidden. The aliens were pleased with the food and dishes of all kinds, with the gastronomy from nearly every country in the world. Those were unparalleled flavors that their palates weren’t accustomed to feel. In addition, tours to cinemas, theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainments made their visit to our planet very pleasant. This pleasure was completely new. They only knew the history of their ancestors. *** On a Sunday, Nicolas invited his friends to go to a huge amusement park that was in the city. The rollercoaster was kilometric. The boy challenged them to the adventure and everyone looked at each other nervous. Tibor said: “This is easy for me. I’ll buy five tickets.” So he ran to the box office. Zara was afraid, but decided to let the adrenaline rush. They all went to the rollercoaster and returned disheveled and agitated. Nicolas invited Zara to ride a Ferris wheel and when they were up there, he showed the beauty of the city to her, what ended up creating a romantic mood. When they stopped, they kissed with passion. It was amazing to notice the adrenaline of his lover, and also introducing her the good things of his world. He felt complete beside her and wished immensely that such moment didn’t come to an end. *** On another occasion, Nicolas took Zara to watch a movie that she enjoyed a lot. It was a novel and the meeting was very nice, with popcorn and soda, while they played and talked about nothing important. When he discovered that she liked the cinema and that her favorite movies were the romances, the boy decided he would take her to enjoy that kind of entertainment whenever possible. He knew he was somehow part of her life and that the pleasure they shared was genuine and unconditional. *** Nicolas also wanted to introduce the other beauties of our planet to Zara. “Zara, the people from your planet seem a little tense. They’re always talking about environmental destruction and degradation of the hydro resources of the Earth. Here on my planet there are many wonderful things to be done and seen. From the past to the present, humans were born, genius or not, and fought hard to turn people into what we are today. Freedom of opinion, the end of prejudice in all its forms, the search for the cure of many diseases that killed thousands of people were some of the reasons for these humans to fight so much. Revolutions in thought with great men and women who had stood out in history resulted in the achievement of equality rights and freedom of their nations. Even today, there are still fights in countries because of democracy and the basic rights of the human society. We still have many problems to solve, but there are wonderful people willing to do their part to improve our systems.” He paused for a moment, kissing her lightly on the lips and continued. “I would like to enjoy these moments we have together and take you to see other places. Then, he held Zara’s hand. They both pressed their watches and their first was at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The night was falling and the lights began to be turned on. She was dazzled by the sight and said: “What a beautiful thing, Nicolas. I didn’t know you were so romantic.” “Here in Paris we are behind the time of New York. We’ll have dinner at a restaurant on top of the tower. The view is unbelievable.” After a tasty dinner, the boy decided to make another surprise for his lover. “Honey, close your eyes, I’ll take you to another wonderful place.” So they went to the Taj Mahal Palace, one of the most popular monuments of India. The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum located in Agra, considered one of the Seven Wonders of the modern world. With their walls full of with semi-precious stones, the dome has gold strands, which impress the visitors. They say it was built to house the body of the wife of a powerful sultan of the country in which it is located. “Nicolas, it looks a bit like the Palace of the King Zador II, on my planet. It’s beautiful and magnificent, and the clothing of the people are very different from those used in other countries.” Said the doctor. “Here on Earth there are different traditions. So many races and cultures are a great opportunity for the human being to live with differences and develop their spirituality. That’s what makes our world so special.” After that, they returned to U.S.A. to meet the other members of the team. Sivoc observed with attention that Nicolas and Zara wanted to be together all the time and there was nothing more to do to prevent the relationship of the two of them. He knew there were reports in his planet about other encounters between humans of different ages and the result was unpredictable. He imagined that it was actually possible to have hybrid terrestrial beings living among children of humans and extraterrestrial beings of the future. Although they transmuted themselves to accomplish their missions, their new bodies provided a loving approximation for the people from Earth. “When love dominates the mind and heart, anything is possible. Humans will always fall in love, because this is the formula for the perpetuation of the human race.” Reflected the commander. He remembered his wife Laiza and his kids. He thought about how hard it was to conquer her because, at the time, her family didn’t allow their marriage. Since he was a traveler scientist, her parents knew she would only be able to stay with her family while her husband was on a mission. That wasn’t what they wanted to Laiza. However, now she was his great love and everything he did was for the sake of his family. Therefore, he didn’t know if he had the right to interfere in the love that was born between Zara and Nicolas.",

      "content": "– XI. The Other Mission of Merko – While Merko rested in his ship, he began to remember his previous mission with his friend Silion. At that time, they came to test the effects of magnetic and gravitational fields over the people from planet Vida. Besides, they were also experiencing the accuracy of time-space travel. When they were on the American desert in New Mexico, they were attacked by the North American Air Force. “Enable the anti-radars shield of the ship, Silion.” Merko ordered. “Barrier enabled. Commander, a red light on the control panel is showing a failure in the shell.” Silion said. “Quick, turn on the force field.” Merko warned. “Let’s get out of here fast and try to get to the Exosphere, put the ship at full speed.” Before they could escape, two F-16 fighters were prepared for the attack, and one of them managed to hit the ship. In the moments that proceeded the fall of ship in the American desert, Merko teleported himself away from the place. He tried to take Silion with him, but his friend was seriously injured, so he couldn’t save him, although he had done his best. The Americans took the ship and a wounded Silion to an Army base in Arizona. There, they began to make experiences. His friend, even wounded, managed to communicate telepathically and was about to kill himself when Merko asked for a chance to try to save him. The men of the Alpha-Omega secret team arrived in their white overalls and injected a substance into the bloodstream of Silion. They removed samples of his skin, bone marrow and one rare strain of hair. All of this was sent to the lab. “This is weird, their blood is red, just like ours!” said Ronald, the chief of staff that accompanied everything from a control room. The same man who would command, in the future, the investigation about Nicolas and Zara. “Let’s decipher the mysteries of these extraterrestrial beings and, who knows, maybe later they may reveal their technology. The department wants to know how they manage to travel through universe.” “We need to know their technologies. They must own very powerful weapons that will be able to subdue our enemies. So we’ll be several steps ahead of the other governments of the Earth.” Spoke Keith, one of the scientists from Alpha-Omega group, who was standing next to Ronald. “Be very careful with our specimen. I want four men on guard, 24 hours a day, taking turns.” Said the chief. “But, sir, we are in the Base 51 of U.S. Army. It is the most secure place on the planet! It was designed to protect the president and his family even against attacks with nuclear bombs. There’s no risk with the alien here inside, we don’t need to take extra measures of protection.” Keith said. “Never underestimate the enemy. That’s how we lose battles and even wars.” agent Ronald replied. “As soon as the medication kicks in, let’s start the interrogation. Take care of the injuries and try to recover his consciousness.” Ordered one of the team’s doctors. Silion, still hostage, pondered how those people were ignorant. “If the primates had red blood, like Australopithecus, why would my blood be different? Instead of trying an approximation, they just want my people’s technology and our weapons to subjugate other nations. How underdeveloped they are! I must do something to set me free.” He thought at last. “Please, Silion don’t give up now! I believe I found a way to get there.” Merko communicated telepathically with his close friend. “My friend, we were instructed to end up our own lives in case of being captured. We know that our contacts can cause fatal consequences for the evolution of the human race.” Silion replied. “Please hold on a little longer, I need only one more day. Please give me a chance to execute my plan.” Merko always sought a solution to the unexpected problems and used to accomplish his missions, no matter how difficult they were. So, he teleported himself, touching the blue watch he had on his wrist, to reach the base 51, put on his glasses, turned himself up and watched the movement of everyone who entered there. “How’s the situation in there?” He asked anxiously, telepathically. “There are many men in white clothes, preparing to examine me. However, they seem to be waiting for someone.” Silion said. In fact, the agents were waiting for someone, agent Ronald and agent Keith, who were preparing them for the interrogation. Although the Alpha-Omega staff belonged to the government, they had to work secretly; in the case of peaceful contact with extraterrestrials from other nations the government wouldn’t be politically harmed. The capture and incarceration mission was executed by the military, which had well prepared basis and good logistics, while team members of the Alpha-Omega group, who were subordinated to the Pentagon, performed the part of researches, communication and intelligence. So, Merko saw a major, who had entered the place with an army vehicle and, for fifteen minutes, remained in the background. When he came out, he started to follow him. He kept teleported himself to the places where the soldier was heading, and was planning to take his place. Quietly, he arrived at the soldier’s house. Still in the garden of the residence, he approached the man with a laser gun he was carrying. The major passed out, and Merko scraped some cells from the inner portion of his cheeks and sent his genetic information to a chip adapted to their glasses of genetic transmutation. Immediately, he became a perfect copy of the major and decided to disintegrate him with his laser gun, so there wouldn’t be any evidence of his death. Someone in the window called him suddenly, and he could see it was a beautiful woman. “Hi, John. I thought you wouldn’t leave that damned base. The government is crazy to build these places underground. Besides, if some catastrophe happens they are the only ones who’ll be saved. And what they will do in an empty world? Come on, please, I made a delicious dinner.” Merko walked around the room admiring the neat place, with a roaring fireplace in the background. The place seemed comfortable with dim lights and candles. “It’s a very nice place”, he thought. There were pictures of the major with Lorena, his wife. She had curly golden hair, smooth white skin like peach and a beauty worthy of a goddess. “Come on, baby, take a hot bath. Everything is already prepared upstairs, but hurry, because the dinner is ready and I found that red wine that you love in the cellar.” Lorena said. Merko, without saying a word, went upstairs as a servant and took his hot bath. He quickly returned and soon realized that the sound he emitted was the perfect voice of the major. He thought how much the genetic engineering and nanotechnology worked well. “Let’s have dinner, honey. Today you’re so quiet. Did anything happen?” She asked. “No, I’m just tired.” He answered. “Wait until after dinner that I will give you that massage you love.” Said the beautiful woman. He then experienced the taste of that delicious wine with a delicious dinner and soon began to yawn, showing fatigue. They went up to the bedroom, and Lorena began to kiss him, and they made love, making Merko forget his friend and everything around him. When they woke up, he put on the uniform of the soldier and was on his way to the base, only thinking about saving his friend. “Where have you been, Merko? For a moment I thought you had left. I’m in trouble, and it seems that experience is imminent. The movement here is big.” Silion said telepathically. “Wait, I’m coming.” Promptly, Merko replied. With the insignia of the soldier, he entered the camp and he had to calibrate the coordinates of teleportation to get to his friend and then escape. He knew his laser gun was very powerful, but he also knew it would be difficult to fight with all the soldiers, so he needed a good strategy. Already infiltrated on the base, he decided to take one of the men in white that would examine Silion. He immobilized and took him to a room. He disintegrated him along with the clothes of the major and continued walking, now transfigured in that new figure, following his purpose. He knew he could become any person and still could, if necessary use a power that few in his planet possessed or knew how to use, the telekinesis, the ability to move objects with psychic force. This ability always made him weak and he would only use it in extreme situations. He approached a room covered by glass on all sides. He could see four men around a table where a being was laid. He soon realized that he was in the right place. They were about to inject a substance into Silion’s arm, when Merko teleported himself into the room and, with four blows in fatal regions, he shoot down all opponents. “How do you feel?” He asked to Silion. “Very weak and wounded. I think you’d better go alone.” Meanwhile, in a room nearby, a general and his staff were following the procedure. The agents Ronald and Keith were preparing the equipment for the experiments with the specimen but at that moment were in another room next to the general. “General, there’s something wrong. A man is freeing our specimen and appears to be running.” Said the captain of the operation. “Ring the alarm. It looks like we’ve got luck. Probably we’ll catch two fish with one bait.” Said the general with a smile. A large operation soldiers invaded the research room. All escape routes were closed. Merko placed Silion over his shoulders when he said: “My friend, my life cycle is almost over. Please save your life. Use the laser on me and teleport yourself to the ship. They didn’t manage to get any information from me, you arrived just in time. They took my transmutation recognition infrared glasses, but it won’t make any difference if you escape. Go to Challenge I fast. It’s already programmed to take you back. At this point, the ship was already ready; it was repaired by self-healing robots.” With tearful eyes, Merko disintegrated his friend. When he was preparing himself to press the button of his watch, he noticed that there was someone behind him, ready to attack. It was a Ranger Sergeant. And then two more soldiers appeared. Merko decided to face them because he wanted to avenge the death of his best friend. “Where is your friend? Did he escape or is hiding?” The sergeant asked with irony. Soon they realized that the aliens had the ability to turn into humans. While Merko prepared himself for the attack, someone hit him from behind and he got a bit stunned. But the struggle was just the beginning. With his great skill, he struck deadly blows at everyone, one after another. Suddenly, there came many others and he had to use the telekinesis, moving all the objects of the place against its rivals, including pointing their weapons to each other. They all stood still for a moment with the guns in the air, pointing at them. When the general arrived at the main entrance, holding a grenade, he said: “You’d better surrender, or I’ll throw this grenade and kill us all.” “This is for my friend Silion, who you have imprisoned and murdered.” Merko replied. With the power of his mind, he removed the lock pin of the grenade. The general looked terrified and said: “You’re totally crazy! We’ll all die together.” In the experiences room of the Army Base, everything was blown. Only the agents Ronald and Keith managed to escape unharmed from the explosion, because they were on the command room, which was isolated and protected by armored walls. From their refuge, they observed the damage that the alien had made in the military base. They observed everything being destroyed, his friends losing their lives, and they couldn’t do anything at that time besides watching, submissive, to all the destruction caused by the alien. Immediately after removing the pin from the grenade, and even before the big explosion that destroyed part of the military complex, Merko pressed the button of his watch and reached his ship. He knew that, unlike the military, he wasn’t bound to that room and wasn’t taking any risk with the grenade. Now his friend was avenged. He prepared himself to return to space. He checked all the controls of the ship and went up with an unbelievable speed. He left behind his great friend Silion and the beautiful Lorena, who briefly was the best thing that happened in his whole life. While he reflected on the mission, though about how Silion was always ready to protect him and willing to go anywhere with his friend. Several times he had saved his life and he wasn’t able to repay. His eyes watered with sadness. He also couldn’t stop thinking about the beautiful Lorena. He didn’t understand how he been able to feel attraction for a woman from the past. However, she was so lovely and beautiful that he couldn’t stop thinking about her. If he could go back in time, maybe he wouldn’t have gone away and would take the major’s place. On his planet he could never be happy with anyone and, deep in his heart, he felt that he could be happy with Lorena. Living as an impostor, however, wasn’t a pleasant idea to him, even though that woman was capable of messing with his heart, hardened by failed relationships. The commander has programmed his ship to enter the space-time bridge with warp speed and ordered to Z8, the central computer of the ship: “Z8, take the ship home safely. I want to rest a bit. Just call me in case of an emergency.” “Yes, commander.” Z8 replied. *** While the Challenge I was heading for the planet Vida, under the command of Z8, Merko could rest. But his mind couldn’t relax, and he was plagued by several memories of moments spent beside Silion. One adventure that went back and forth had happened five years ago. A giant meteor was on a collision course with the planet Vida. All the alternatives to intercept and destroy it had been discarded by the Royal Council. There was only one chance to deflect the asteroid: Using a powerful laser beam that could bombard and destroy it from the planet Vida while it was still thousands of miles away from the fatal encounter. The Challenge II ship, which was coupled to a laser gun, however, was defective, and engineers worked tirelessly to fix it. There was no time to solve the problem of repairing the ship, and the gun couldn’t be removed or transported to another vehicle in a time. As they were all condemned to death with the imminent destruction of the planet, Merko fierce entered his ship Challenge I and decided to leave in order to project himself against the meteor. He would try to use the own Challenge I, heading toward the celestial body, being tangential to one of its ends in order to get it out of his route. His computer, Z8, had calculated the exact time and point of impact in which they would get the highest percentage of success in the mission of saving the planet Vida. The commander didn’t say goodbye to anyone, knowing that many would try to stop him from continuing with his suicide mission. He entered his ship and departed at an extraordinary speed toward the asteroid, which was still at a safe distance to change its course. Silion watched his friend in his last moments. He knew Merko very well and knew that something strange was about to happen. Before he left, they talked: “Merko, why haven’t you talked to anyone lately? What’s on your mind, my friend?” “I’m worried about the arrival of Meteor X26. I believe it will be impossible to stop it and we’ll all die. I must think of a way out.” “Our engineers will be able to recover the Challenge II on time. The weapons are ready and only the reactor still needs to be repaired.” “Dear Silion, when they repair the ship it will be too late. There’s no time left, X26 is close to a point where we won’t be able to stop it. We both know that very well! We don’t need to fool ourselves with false hopes. There’s no time to wait for the Challenge II to be repaired.” Silion lowered his head, feeling sad, and let Merko alone. He knew that in difficult situations, the commander used to make wise decisions and that he would find a way out. A few hours later, he looked for him again and found out that his ship was gone. Silion had a bad feeling and imagined that the captain had left for death. At an incredible speed, Merko had programmed his ship to a course against the large asteroid. The commander was traveling with tears in his eyes, thinking about everything he had left behind. At the same time, he hoped that the impact was enough to save the planet and all its inhabitants. Silion quickly went to meet the engineers that recovered the ship’s reactors. He asked for urgency in the repair and accelerated all the steps of the maintenance process. Merko could already see the monster X26, that seemed voracious on it purpose. Silently, he said goodbye to his life. When the ship approached, a few miles away, he heard a voice shouting in a holograph that appeared in front of him: “My friend Merko, open the way, because I’ll use the laser in this meteor!” He only had time to observe the powerful red ray passing near his ship and hit X26 with surgical precision. The asteroid passed close to Merko’s ship, and he felt the effect of its passage. The meteor moved away from the planet Vida and everyone was saved, including the commander who had been so close to surrender his life for his planet. “You’re crazy, Merko. You would sacrifice yourself for humanity. I’d really miss you, my friend. “Thanks again, Silion. You always appear when I need the most. I was really willing to give my life for the continuation of the human race, but I confess I’m happy to continue living. Let’s go home to celebrate my return. *** After losing his close friend, Silion, Merko remembered returning to planet Vida, the moment his life was saved. In memory of Silion, because he knew that would be his friend’s will, he decided to continue his current mission, doing what he liked. He loved the space travels. To contemplate the big bright stars, planets and their satellites was his greatest pleasure. Those visions were what most impressed Merko. When he had to execute some mission and let the adrenaline circulate through his veins, that was what really made him happy. He wished one day he could find a woman with an adventurous spirit that would complete his life, but had no hopes. He had already tried before and failed. He couldn’t forget that woman from the past. There was something different about her that messed with the captain. But he didn’t knew that a woman like Lorena was a treasure that is not easily found, nor on Earth, neither in the planet Vida. *** On Earth, Lorena couldn’t understand what had happened to the army major, John, her husband, who disappeared suddenly. After a useless wait, she decided to move from the state. She left Arizona, where her husband worked, and moved to Los Angeles to raise her child. She didn’t understand what had happened to John after that unforgettable night they spent together. The next morning, he left to work with his usual mysterious behavior. She had no idea what exactly he was doing in that military base, from where he never returned. The army had no concrete news and just informed that her husband was missing. She began to be supported by the government, but she really missed the man she had lost. She was also sorry because she hadn’t been able to make a funeral and give a decent goodbye to the man she had loved, the father of her only child. She was very sad, but continued to raise her son, Nicolas. With great difficulty she managed to educate him and now she paid the University where he studied. Some years later, Sophia was born, which was a blessing and she also struggled to give her a good education. She was very proud of her kids, because they both were excellent students, didn’t get involved with bad companies and had clear purposes to succeed in life: Nicolas wanted to become a great physics, and Sophia dreamed of being an environmental engineer. Despite how much she missed her husband, Lorena had managed to overcome her fears. She raised her kids very well, who were growing up healthy and with good characters. But she still missed a great love in her life.",

When they woke up, he put on the uniform of the soldier and was on his way to the base, only thinking about saving his friend. “Where have you been, Merko? For a moment I thought you had left. I’m in trouble, and it seems that experience is imminent. The movement here is big.” Silion said telepathically. “Wait, I’m coming.” Promptly, Merko replied. With the insignia of the soldier, he entered the camp and he had to calibrate the coordinates of teleportation to get to his friend and then escape. He knew his laser gun was very powerful, but he also knew it would be difficult to fight with all the soldiers, so he needed a good strategy. Already infiltrated on the base, he decided to take one of the men in white that would examine Silion. He immobilized and took him to a room. He disintegrated him along with the clothes of the major and continued walking, now transfigured in that new figure, following his purpose. He knew he could become any person and still could, if necessary use a power that few in his planet possessed or knew how to use, the telekinesis, the ability to move objects with psychic force. This ability always made him weak and he would only use it in extreme situations. He approached a room covered by glass on all sides. He could see four men around a table where a being was laid. He soon realized that he was in the right place. They were about to inject a substance into Silion’s arm, when Merko teleported himself into the room and, with four blows in fatal regions, he shoot down all opponents. “How do you feel?” He asked to Silion. “Very weak and wounded. I think you’d better go alone.” Meanwhile, in a room nearby, a general and his staff were following the procedure. The agents Ronald and Keith were preparing the equipment for the experiments with the specimen but at that moment were in another room next to the general. “General, there’s something wrong. A man is freeing our specimen and appears to be running.” Said the captain of the operation. “Ring the alarm. It looks like we’ve got luck. Probably we’ll catch two fish with one bait.” Said the general with a smile. A large operation soldiers invaded the research room. All escape routes were closed. Merko placed Silion over his shoulders when he said: “My friend, my life cycle is almost over. Please save your life. Use the laser on me and teleport yourself to the ship. They didn’t manage to get any information from me, you arrived just in time. They took my transmutation recognition infrared glasses, but it won’t make any difference if you escape. Go to Challenge I fast. It’s already programmed to take you back. At this point, the ship was already ready; it was repaired by self-healing robots.” With tearful eyes, Merko disintegrated his friend. When he was preparing himself to press the button of his watch, he noticed that there was someone behind him, ready to attack. It was a Ranger Sergeant. And then two more soldiers appeared. Merko decided to face them because he wanted to avenge the death of his best friend. “Where is your friend? Did he escape or is hiding?” The sergeant asked with irony. Soon they realized that the aliens had the ability to turn into humans. While Merko prepared himself for the attack, someone hit him from behind and he got a bit stunned. But the struggle was just the beginning. With his great skill, he struck deadly blows at everyone, one after another. Suddenly, there came many others and he had to use the telekinesis, moving all the objects of the place against its rivals, including pointing their weapons to each other. They all stood still for a moment with the guns in the air, pointing at them. When the general arrived at the main entrance, holding a grenade, he said: “You’d better surrender, or I’ll throw this grenade and kill us all.” “This is for my friend Silion, who you have imprisoned and murdered.” Merko replied. With the power of his mind, he removed the lock pin of the grenade. The general looked terrified and said: “You’re totally crazy! We’ll all die together.” In the experiences room of the Army Base, everything was blown. Only the agents Ronald and Keith managed to escape unharmed from the explosion, because they were on the command room, which was isolated and protected by armored walls. From their refuge, they observed the damage that the alien had made in the military base. They observed everything being destroyed, his friends losing their lives, and they couldn’t do anything at that time besides watching, submissive, to all the destruction caused by the alien. Immediately after removing the pin from the grenade, and even before the big explosion that destroyed part of the military complex, Merko pressed the button of his watch and reached his ship. He knew that, unlike the military, he wasn’t bound to that room and wasn’t taking any risk with the grenade. Now his friend was avenged. He prepared himself to return to space. He checked all the controls of the ship and went up with an unbelievable speed. He left behind his great friend Silion and the beautiful Lorena, who briefly was the best thing that happened in his whole life. While he reflected on the mission, though about how Silion was always ready to protect him and willing to go anywhere with his friend. Several times he had saved his life and he wasn’t able to repay. His eyes watered with sadness. He also couldn’t stop thinking about the beautiful Lorena. He didn’t understand how he been able to feel attraction for a woman from the past. However, she was so lovely and beautiful that he couldn’t stop thinking about her. If he could go back in time, maybe he wouldn’t have gone away and would take the major’s place. On his planet he could never be happy with anyone and, deep in his heart, he felt that he could be happy with Lorena. Living as an impostor, however, wasn’t a pleasant idea to him, even though that woman was capable of messing with his heart, hardened by failed relationships. The commander has programmed his ship to enter the space-time bridge with warp speed and ordered to Z8, the central computer of the ship: “Z8, take the ship home safely. I want to rest a bit. Just call me in case of an emergency.” “Yes, commander.” Z8 replied. *** While the Challenge I was heading for the planet Vida, under the command of Z8, Merko could rest. But his mind couldn’t relax, and he was plagued by several memories of moments spent beside Silion. One adventure that went back and forth had happened five years ago. A giant meteor was on a collision course with the planet Vida. All the alternatives to intercept and destroy it had been discarded by the Royal Council. There was only one chance to deflect the asteroid: Using a powerful laser beam that could bombard and destroy it from the planet Vida while it was still thousands of miles away from the fatal encounter. The Challenge II ship, which was coupled to a laser gun, however, was defective, and engineers worked tirelessly to fix it. There was no time to solve the problem of repairing the ship, and the gun couldn’t be removed or transported to another vehicle in a time. As they were all condemned to death with the imminent destruction of the planet, Merko fierce entered his ship Challenge I and decided to leave in order to project himself against the meteor. He would try to use the own Challenge I, heading toward the celestial body, being tangential to one of its ends in order to get it out of his route. His computer, Z8, had calculated the exact time and point of impact in which they would get the highest percentage of success in the mission of saving the planet Vida. The commander didn’t say goodbye to anyone, knowing that many would try to stop him from continuing with his suicide mission. He entered his ship and departed at an extraordinary speed toward the asteroid, which was still at a safe distance to change its course. Silion watched his friend in his last moments. He knew Merko very well and knew that something strange was about to happen. Before he left, they talked: “Merko, why haven’t you talked to anyone lately? What’s on your mind, my friend?” “I’m worried about the arrival of Meteor X26. I believe it will be impossible to stop it and we’ll all die. I must think of a way out.” “Our engineers will be able to recover the Challenge II on time. The weapons are ready and only the reactor still needs to be repaired.” “Dear Silion, when they repair the ship it will be too late. There’s no time left, X26 is close to a point where we won’t be able to stop it. We both know that very well! We don’t need to fool ourselves with false hopes. There’s no time to wait for the Challenge II to be repaired.” Silion lowered his head, feeling sad, and let Merko alone. He knew that in difficult situations, the commander used to make wise decisions and that he would find a way out. A few hours later, he looked for him again and found out that his ship was gone. Silion had a bad feeling and imagined that the captain had left for death. At an incredible speed, Merko had programmed his ship to a course against the large asteroid. The commander was traveling with tears in his eyes, thinking about everything he had left behind. At the same time, he hoped that the impact was enough to save the planet and all its inhabitants. Silion quickly went to meet the engineers that recovered the ship’s reactors. He asked for urgency in the repair and accelerated all the steps of the maintenance process. Merko could already see the monster X26, that seemed voracious on it purpose. Silently, he said goodbye to his life. When the ship approached, a few miles away, he heard a voice shouting in a holograph that appeared in front of him: “My friend Merko, open the way, because I’ll use the laser in this meteor!” He only had time to observe the powerful red ray passing near his ship and hit X26 with surgical precision. The asteroid passed close to Merko’s ship, and he felt the effect of its passage. The meteor moved away from the planet Vida and everyone was saved, including the commander who had been so close to surrender his life for his planet. “You’re crazy, Merko. You would sacrifice yourself for humanity. I’d really miss you, my friend. “Thanks again, Silion. You always appear when I need the most. I was really willing to give my life for the continuation of the human race, but I confess I’m happy to continue living. Let’s go home to celebrate my return. *** After losing his close friend, Silion, Merko remembered returning to planet Vida, the moment his life was saved. In memory of Silion, because he knew that would be his friend’s will, he decided to continue his current mission, doing what he liked. He loved the space travels. To contemplate the big bright stars, planets and their satellites was his greatest pleasure. Those visions were what most impressed Merko. When he had to execute some mission and let the adrenaline circulate through his veins, that was what really made him happy. He wished one day he could find a woman with an adventurous spirit that would complete his life, but had no hopes. He had already tried before and failed. He couldn’t forget that woman from the past. There was something different about her that messed with the captain. But he didn’t knew that a woman like Lorena was a treasure that is not easily found, nor on Earth, neither in the planet Vida. *** On Earth, Lorena couldn’t understand what had happened to the army major, John, her husband, who disappeared suddenly. After a useless wait, she decided to move from the state. She left Arizona, where her husband worked, and moved to Los Angeles to raise her child. She didn’t understand what had happened to John after that unforgettable night they spent together. The next morning, he left to work with his usual mysterious behavior. She had no idea what exactly he was doing in that military base, from where he never returned. The army had no concrete news and just informed that her husband was missing. She began to be supported by the government, but she really missed the man she had lost. She was also sorry because she hadn’t been able to make a funeral and give a decent goodbye to the man she had loved, the father of her only child. She was very sad, but continued to raise her son, Nicolas. With great difficulty she managed to educate him and now she paid the University where he studied. Some years later, Sophia was born, which was a blessing and she also struggled to give her a good education. She was very proud of her kids, because they both were excellent students, didn’t get involved with bad companies and had clear purposes to succeed in life: Nicolas wanted to become a great physics, and Sophia dreamed of being an environmental engineer. Despite how much she missed her husband, Lorena had managed to overcome her fears. She raised her kids very well, who were growing up healthy and with good characters. But she still missed a great love in her life.",

      "content": "– XII. Lorena’s Sadness – Twelve years after the disappearance of the major, Lorena met a gentleman who charmed her in a birthday party of one of Nicolas’ friends from school. His name was Robert. Since she had already spent many years alone, she decided to give herself a chance and try another relationship. She was excited at the prospect of loving and being loved again. Mr. Robert was a good man. He was a civil engineer, who was always involved in large projects and, as Lorena, was also a widower. He had beautiful green eyes and dark brown hair, wore a mustache, which was already slightly grizzled, and was extremely charming. When he saw Lorena, he immediately became fascinated with her golden hair and her beauty. He asked her out and she accepted, because besides being elegant, he was also an educated and interesting man. Robert fell in love and did everything to get Lorena, who also surrendered herself to her new love. They both tried to be happy again. After two years, Lorena gave birth to a daughter called Sophia, who became her great friend; when she was not at school, she wanted to go with her mother everywhere. Robert also loved his daughter and did everything to please her. He helped her raising Nicolas, advising him and acting like he was his real father. Together they formed a happy family. However, Robert died shortly after Sophia’s birth, because of a massive heart attack, which occurred during one of his trips. He worked very hard and was always stressed, although he was almost retiring. That was another pain for the young woman to carry in her life marked by irreparable losses. Thus, Lorena became a widow of two husbands. Robert was a great companion, although she hadn’t felt for him the overwhelming love she felt for the major who had disappeared so many years ago. Now, besides the pain of losing two men, her son had also disappeared. She loved the boy and was completely lost without him. That was what happened with the major; he simply disappeared and was considered dead. She knew she couldn’t resist the same pain again. At least she had been able to provide a funeral to Robert, saying goodbye and whenever she missed him she could go to her husband’s grave to pray. She needed at least to find the body of her son. She didn’t lose the hope of finding him alive, but she knew the chances were few, because Nick had always been a very responsible kid and would have already gotten in touch if he could do it. Lorena did everything she could to try to find her son. She placed advertisements in all the newspapers, informed the FBI about his disappearance and went to the University to seek for clues and understand why her son, who was so dedicated haven’t shown up for a few weeks. She and Sophia were alone, but Lorena found strength to continue to live and to look for her son. After several months, she finally received a mysterious email from Nicolas. “Mother, I love you. Don’t worry, I’m fine. But I can’t go back now; I’m involved with a problem related to a friend. Please, don’t tell anyone that you spoke to me. Keep pretending I’m missing. For our sake and little Sophia’s. Soon, everything will be solved. Kisses from your son who loves you more than anything, Nicolas.” *** Nicolas always knew he shouldn’t get in touch with his mother. From the beginning, however, he tried to think of alternatives to calm Lorena down. After talking a lot with Drako, who was an expert in Information Systems, the two of them managed to create a way to send an untraceable email, so that Merko couldn’t use the message to get to him. They still needed a few weeks and many meetings to convince Sivoc that it would be safe to send the email. As soon as it was possible, Nicolas managed to send a message to his mother. *** After seeing that e-mail, Lorena felt a mix of sensations. On one hand, she was relieved to know that her son was alive, but then she was worried about losing him. She decided to wait, because there was nothing else to do about Nicolas. She had to trust her son, who always knew how to be responsible. At school, he was a model student with good grades and never brought trouble home. He always made his mother proud with his virtues, morals and common sense. Certainly, something very strange was happening. And although she trusted her son, Lorena couldn’t remove all the anguish of her heart, after all, she was pretty worried.",

      "title": "– XIII. The Confrontation –",
      "content": "– XIII. The Confrontation – Merko, Crom and the others from his team reached the position of the ship on the bottom of the sea, in the Gulf of Mexico. They positioned the Challenge I beside it and entered the Science II teleporting themselves, but nobody was there. With a paralyzing gun, they left the robot dog, Little Wolf, out of action. Only his eyes were moving from side to side watching the movements of the invaders. That was when Merko said: “Crom, check in the central computer the last location they were transported from the ship. There must be some record of their position.” So, they managed to know what would be the next step: to follow the coordinates of the teleportation position registered in the ship. However, Drako had placed false records of latitude and longitude on the computers boards in order to distract them. Merko and his team didn’t anticipate the intelligence of the Information System’s expert and headed to the places indicated in the ship’s computer, moving away from the ones they were pursuing. The trick used by Drako was a way for Sivoc’s team to gain some time and hide while waiting for the opening day of the wormhole near Calisto moon, where intergalactic positions would become perfect for the trip back. Merko and his soldiers looked around and realized they were in the Red Square, the tourist site most famous and visited of Russia. The big streets of Moscow starting on this square and were heading to several places. They observed many tourists who admired the beauties of the place. The tour guides showed all the buildings around, which were historically important. Merko and the others put the infrared glasses to find signs of transmuted people, but couldn’t see them. They walked through the crowd with their sunglasses and didn’t detect the presence of their targets. “Mr. Commander, I can’t understand why they would come to this place so far from home and from the boys country. I observed in other records of the ship, and the places don’t make sense. Istanbul in Turkey, Tokyo in Japan...” “You don’t need to continue. Drako had duped us. He’s very smart and I didn’t think that this hunt would be easy. Let’s go back to our ship and think of some strategy. We need a better plan to find them.” *** Without achieving success in finding them, Merko again decided to contact Mirov, the organizer and advisor of his mission. “Counselor, I’d like to know if you got any other information about the target. We’re very close to it, but your help would be of great value at this time.” “Merko, give me a few hours to try to gather as much information as possible. I’ll contact you as soon as possible.” “I’m waiting for new information, counselor.” After some hours, Mirov returned the contact with good news. “Radof only got some information in the Royal Palace. They are in the country where the earthling lives, but that was the only thing I could discover. Certainly they’re hidden.” “Understood, Mr. Counselor. I’ll use this information the best way I can. We’ll find the earthling soon and we’ll succeed in our mission.” With this, they realized how difficult it would be to find them. They wouldn’t reveal themselves so easily and were certainly taking all the necessary precautions to remain hidden. Merko decided to trace a research strategy to track them. *** For the luck of Sivoc’s crew, they were all hidden. Sivoc, Drako and Zara rested in the apartment while Nicolas and Tibor trained in the martial arts academy. Sivoc was quiet, listening to classical music, which came from the radio and felt like it was penetrating deep into his soul making him relax. It was a symphony of Beethoven. “Simply a magnificent work of art!” He thought. The apartment in which he and his crew lived was large, with three bedrooms. The living room had the walls painted in the color of sand, with a comfortable sofa and a recliner. In his bedroom, there was a large window with a wonderful view of the city, where they spend a lot of time watching the frantic “coming and going” of the people. Living there, waiting for the days to go by, he never imagined that his rival Merko was searching at all the databases for any information, no matter how small, to look for the place where they were hidden. Crom, using regular tools of search, found some news about the episode that occurred in New York with the gang who levitated and remained suspended in a tree. The strange event caught the attention of the sensationalist media and was reported in all major newspapers online. Noticing that this was important evidence, he ran to his commandant and questioned him: “Mr. Merko, I think I found some important information about our target. Look at this fact in the city of New York.” “Brilliant, Captain Crom. A couple that imprisoned bandits by levitating them. It sounds like telekinesis. But how is it possible? The members of Science II don’t have this power. However, this fact is obviously related to them. Hurry, prepare all men. We’ll teleport ourselves there. I’m sure we’ll find more clues about Sivoc and his crew.” *** Merko and his team were in New York to try to find Nicolas. As the episode found in the newspapers had happened in Central Park, they decided to start their search there. They were all dressed with a costume that would make them go unnoticed amidst the crowd: jeans, blazers and black shoes. All the information about the clothing of the time and place had been obtained in the database of the ship. “Merko, we need to observe how they live here so we can create a capture plan. While we look for someone in the crowd, we can already devise strategies to make the capture as soon as we find them.” Crom said. “Okay. I know this is you specialty and I trust the task to you.” Merko replied. They spent hours in the park every day, observing the movement of people with their infrared glasses, which would reveal if there were a transmuted among them. After several days of observation, during which Merko’s men were positioned in strategic places to get a better reach and a larger view of the park, they saw a man with the red image showing heat and radiation. It was the signal that they needed to detect a transmuted. They observed the man, who entered into a food store and it was Drako. He looked everywhere and, although he was using his infrared glasses, he couldn’t distinguish his tormentors in front of an intense crowd. At the same time, the men of the Alpha-Omega team were also setting up a stakeout in several places of the city, but only the agent Netil had the glasses, a unique pair they had stolen from Silion, the alien captured years earlier. Even using reverse engineering they weren’t capable to copy the equipment. Thus, Alpha-Omega team had greater difficulty in the search for the aliens, because with only a pair of glasses, they couldn’t scan a very large area, so they would need to wait for some extraordinary event to reveal the presence of visitors from space. With a distance, Crom followed Drako for several blocks, taking great care not to be seen. He realized that he also carried the glasses and he had to be very cautious in his pursuit. Still hidden, he saw Drako entering a building, probably the apartment where he and his team were hiding. Crom reported to Merko, informing the location. After a brief meeting, during which an alien continued to peek the building, they decided that the best thing to do was to observe that place day and night, because it was certainly Sivoc’s hideout, so, they would find Nicolas there. It would be necessary surveillance of twenty-four hours, so all the movements could be detected and they could trace all the details of the routine of the residents of the building. After a few days, they knew exactly what the routine of every member of Science II was. Merko didn’t want to wait much longer, because he knew that in a few days they would have to cross the space-time passage. He left two soldiers guarding Sivoc, Drako and Zara, and decided to invade the gym where Nicolas and Tibor were, along with Crom and another soldier. *** One of Merko’s soldiers had already followed Nicolas and Tibor to the gym which they attended every day and had the coordinates of the location. After making sure that everything was right and informing its plans once again to Crom and the soldier would go with him, Merko and his companions teleported to the place. He saw the earthling entering the academy of fights, followed by Tibor. When Nicolas was training, Tibor came to him and said: “I’m having a bad feeling, boy. Whatever it is, if there is a problem, try to teleport yourself next to Zara, because she’ll know what to do.” Some seconds after Tibor’s warning, the three men invaded the academy. Alex approached one of them and asked who they were, but Merko, without listening, struck him in his throat. He moved away and continued to fight. Tibor asked Nicolas to get away and soon he was facing Crom, while Merko didn’t take his eyes off his main target, the earthling whose special defense cells were interesting to the inhabitants of the planet Vida. Tibor quickly sent a telepathic signal of danger to everyone from his team and started fighting with Crom. The fight seemed endless because of their mutual capacity. Tibor managed to immobilize Crom with a technical arm lock, a blow often used by the police to immobilize and knock out their opponent. Crom fell unconscious on the floor. Nicolas struggled with one of the soldiers and also managed to knock him down, but Merko got rid of Alex and quickly got to the earthling. When the young man grabbed him by the arm, the experienced soldier reversed the advantage by bending his arm and holding his neck with two fingers of his right hand, leaving him unconscious. “Tibor, you should be one of my officers!” Merko said. “I don’t agree with your methods.” Tibor replied promptly. The two of them approached, after Merko laid the unconscious Nicolas carefully in one of the closest walls. First, the commander tried a Kung-fu blow in Tibor’s throat, but his defense of Karate-do with the top of his right hand, threw a blow in Merko’s stomach. Despite the great skill of his opponent, Merko prepared an attack that no one had managed to escape before. It was an advanced blow, Aikido style. Tibor tried to hit him at the height of his liver, but his opponent turned around holding his arm, making him to hit his head against the wall and fall unconscious. Meanwhile, the members of the academy watched it all, perplexed, and thought it was a workout or some demonstration. They only noticed realized that the attacks were serious when Merko looked at them and pulled his laser gun, scaring them all and making them flee in terror. “Commander, we’d better stop now.” Crom warned Merko when he saw that everybody of the academy was running for their lives. He was getting up slowly; still dazed by the blow he had received. “The situation is already under control and we can’t catch even more attention to our existence. We need to get out of here quickly.” They used only the paralyzing rays to immobilize those who were present and to avoid major problems. They synchronized their watches to get out of there soon. Merko was furious because he didn’t like to leave witnesses to his actions during missions, but he remained silent. He, Crom, and the soldier who came as a support, teleported themselves to the ship carrying Nicolas as prisoner. The boy woke up inside the ship, on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. He looked through the window of the living room where he was and saw sharks and stingrays swimming around. He woke up a bit confused, but gradually began to remember what had happened in the gym. The air in the room was very clean; it seemed composed only of oxygen, which provided him a good sensation when breathing. Soon, however, his attention turned to the place where he was and he could notice that it was some kind of compartment of the ship similar to a bedroom. There was very few furniture, with only one place to lie and another one to sit, both with the shape that allowed the perfect fitting of a person. Nicolas was still watching the place of his captivity, when he heard somebody asking for permission to enter. “Welcome to Challenge I!” At this moment, Nicolas realized he was a prisoner and that his life could be in danger. The conversation was telepathic and the boy couldn’t avoid listening. “Looks like you really like technology. In the future we have the most powerful computers ever seen. But the telepathy used among us, from Planet Vida, and other powers of the mind that you do not know, can only be used by us and not by machines. It is a power inherent to the nature of our thoughts. To let the machines think can be very dangerous.” He paused for a moment, because he noticed the curious eyes of the young man. “I was forgetting to introduce myself; I am Commander Merko, from the planet Vida. As for you, there’s no need to presentations. We all know you.” “I haven’t heard good things about you.” Nicolas replied, frowning, not feeling comfortable with the unexpected presence of his visitor. “I don’t intend to please people. I want to have my job well done. Get comfortable, because in a few days, we’ll travel to planet Vida.” His tormentor left the room and the automatic door closed soon after his departure. Nicolas was scared. As soon as the commander exited, he felt his capacity was recovered. He had been stunned after the fight in the gym and a bit confused to see himself in a strange place. The shock of the unexpected encounter with the feared commander Merko, but, he cleared his mind. The boy was afraid with his imprisonment and wanted to get out of there anyway. He created many plans of escape in his thoughts, but the truth is that he didn’t know the ship Challenge and wouldn’t be easy to leave. Finally, he chose to use telekinesis, which, although it left him extremely tired, was the only trick he had. He concentrated on the objects he saw in the room and made them move to test the powers trained with Tibor. He moved the bed, which was released from the wall, and a table that levitated from the ground. He made them both spin. Then placed them back in their positions and felt himself in control of his mental strength. He looked at the door and opened it. Not very confident, but hopeful, he began to walk through the halls of the ship, slowly and scared, he thought about how he would manage to escape. Another door stood before him and, again he managed to open it. Behind the door, however, a tall shadow denounced Merko’s presence, which surprised the boy in time of the escape. He quickly looked at him, holding his arm tightly. “How did you escape from the room? The door was programmed for you not to leave.” Said the commander, confused to see the earthling wandering through the corridors of the ship. “Reading your mind I can figure out what happened.” Nicolas tried to use his telekinesis to move Merko up, but the commander seemed to annul his strength. He felt Merko invading his mind and was unable to hide his thoughts. “I see I’m not the only one who has the power of telekinesis. A simple earthling with such skill, how can it be? This is very strange.” The commander continued to analyze Nicolas’ mind, looking for answers, but he found out that the boy knew nothing about the source of his powers. He decided to put him it in the room again, but this time he prepared a prison with laser bars, that wouldn’t allow a new opportunity. “Somehow, the earthling managed to acquire the power of telekinesis and almost escaped.” Said Merko to Crom when he returned to the control room, after leaving the earthling trapped in the new cell immune to telekinesis. “How is it possible, Commander? I thought you were the one who had this ability.” “I definitely don’t know. When we get to planet Vida, I’ll ask our scientists to discover what happened to him. I won’t rest until we find out his secret.” Merko showed great concern over the discovery. He gesticulated a lot and seemed very nervous. He had never known anyone else who had this ability. “From what I noticed in his mind, not even he knows the source of his power. We’ll take him in safety and save our princess, this is our priority. Then, we’ll solve the other problem. I won’t allow anyone to have such power.” “The space-time gap will open in three Earth days, Commander.” “We need to prepare the ship for the voyage, Crom. Order the computer to analyze and optimize all operating systems immediately.” Merko said. Nicolas stood alone and realized that he was a prisoner, and the place wasn’t just a room but a cell. The furniture were embedded on the wall, in niches proportional to their sizes, where they automatically entered after being used. Nicolas’ sense of admiration for the ship’s technologies was shared with his fears, and how much he missed Zara and his family. “What happened to Zara and my friends? Are they alive?” He pondered. Sometimes, during the day, Merko went to the earthling’s room to make sure everything was okay. He worried about his health, because he had to take him in good conditions for the surgery. After the escape attempt, he was also interested in studying him, because the power of the earthling surprised him. XIV. Waiting for the Trip Sivoc, Drako and Zara arrived at the gym and there was Tibor, unconscious and lying on the ground. Around him, several students were unconscious; some of them seemed not to be breathing anymore. “Take care of Tibor and the others who are alive, we need to get out of here as soon as possible.” Sivoc said. “Why did you take so long?” Tibor asked while standing up. He was still quite dizzy and a little confused. “There were two men of Merko’s team watching us. I asked help to Drako and we managed to neutralize them, but it cost us some time that seemed very precious. We used laser handcuffs and imprisoned them in our apartment.” Sivoc replied. “Now, what do we do?” Zara asked, feeling anxious. “We’ll remove any trace of our presence here on Earth and return home, to outline a new plan. In three days, the portal will open near the planet Jupiter and the Calisto moon and we need to get to planet Vida along with Merko’s team. Nicolas’ life is in danger, because we don’t know what they will do after the removal of his bone marrow. Certainly, Councilor Mirov won’t obey the order of King Zador II to bring the earthling back to Earth safely.” Sivoc said. Tibor teleported himself first and was resting in the ship, recovering from the fight and from his injuries, while the others finished all the necessary adjustments for the departure. “Drako, did you manage to warn the emergency services to come to the academy and help the wounded?” Asked Zara. “Affirmative, doctor. I have taken all the necessary arrangements. There is no way to track us and everyone had been advised.” As they prepared to leave, the Alpha-Omega team entered the academy, Collin, Ann, and several Special Forces soldiers of the American army. With the special infrared glasses, Collin had followed the aliens, what led them directly to the place of the struggle. When they notice the aliens were still there, they began to use weapons of electrical discharge to try to immobilize and possibly capture them. Collin and Sivoc began a body fight, and Zara teleported herself holding agent Ann behind. Drako used a weapon of sound waves he had pulled from underneath his jacket and the soldiers fell to the ground. Sivoc managed to dominate the agent who fainted. Then Drako and Sivoc looked at agent Ann, who raised her arms and surrendered. Sivoc didn’t want Zara to fight because it was risky for the embryo she carried in her womb. They used a sleeping radius in everyone and a white smoke covered the environment of the academy while they returned to the ship. *** Sivoc’s team fled immediately. They knew that the military reinforcements were on the way. They removed any sign of their presence in New York and decided to teleport themselves to the ship, where they would finish the preparations for the trip. They also needed to verify if the ship had been found by Merko or had been sabotaged. They took the two soldiers of Merko’s team they had imprisoned in Sivoc’s apartment and put them in a cell in the ship Science II. They couldn’t let the m behind on the planet at the mercy of the extraterrestrial capture agents. “Where is Nicolas?” After ensuring the safety of everyone who was present, Zara couldn’t stop thinking about him. They must be waiting for the opening of the wormhole somewhere on the planet. Our chance to save the boy will be to follow them to the planet Vida.” Sivoc replied. “Somehow I feel that he is alive”, thought the doctor. The Science II had been carefully checked, in every single detail, so everyone’s safety could be guaranteed. Zara was the first to realize that Little Wolf had been immobilized. So, everyone knew that Merko and his men had been there. “Certainly he used the computers of the ship to try to find our coordinates of teleport. But Drako camouflaged the data, I have no idea how they managed to find us. What it’s really weird, however, is the fact that they let us live. It doesn’t match with Merko’s methods.” Sivoc concluded. Drako prepared the ship for the voyage back to their planet and repaired the robot dog. He searched for some information on the nature of the monitors that could show what the plans of Merko were, but there was nothing important in the records about his presence. Zara went to her room and began to telepathically focus, hoping to establish contact with her love. She couldn’t lose hope of finding him alive and well. *** Merko’s military ship wasn’t far from Science II. Inside the vehicle, Nicolas was also focused, doing the meditation exercises taught by Tibor. There wasn’t much to do as a prisoner and this was his only hope, although it was small, to get some contact with his friends. “Nick, can you hear me?” Zara said, telepathically. “Yes, I can hear you, Zara! I’m so relieved to get some contact with you. I was already losing hope, because I’m trying to communicate for hours.” “Are you all right, my dear? Are you badly injured?” “I’m fine. I’m not hurt, but I’m locked in a cell.” “On Merko’s ship?” “Exactly.” Nicolas confirmed. “I’m somewhere on the bottom of the sea. There are fish and marine animals everywhere. I can’t say more than that. But where are you?” The communication between the two was difficult due to the presence of many rocks in place. It didn’t matter to Nicolas and Zara, because they were both calmer knowing they were fine. However, they couldn’t imagine that Challenge I and Science II were so close, because Merko’s plan was to capture Sivoc and his team and freeze them when they were together. “I’m in the ship Science II.” “Zara, are you okay? Is Tibor there with you?” “He is Nick. Tibor is still a little stunned, but he had no serious injuries. We are all fine here in the ship.” “Zara, I’m afraid! Can you help me?” “We can’t know what your exact location is, but we will try to reach you on our planet. Take care and be quiet, Merko is very dangerous. We will do everything we can to rescue you, Nick.” Zara replied. *** Merko managed to telepathically intercept the communication between the earthling and Zara and knew that the crew of the Science II had already arrived. He immediately called Crom and two other men to invade the ship and capture the crew. They materialized in the infirmary of the ship Science II and, with a pistol, they froze Tibor, who was resting and recovering from his injuries. “One less, Commander.” Crom said. “Let’s get the others.” “Crom, proceed with discretion. The surprise will be our greatest ally.” They went to the engineering room and turned off the entire propulsion system of the ship, inactivating it for the flight. They also released the other two soldiers of their team who had been imprisoned. “Sir, I programmed the ship to restart the engines in one Earth year, according to your plan.” Sivoc was with Drako in the control room when all the systems turned off. Everything went dark, and the emergency lights lit, leaving the place dimly illuminated. Drako, realizing that something was wrong, had the brilliant idea to turn off the Little Wolf for the programmed period of a day. If anything happened, the robot would return to its active duty on the next day and could follow the rescue protocol configured on its system. Within minutes, Merko, Crom and his soldiers were in the control room. They pointed their guns at Sivoc and Drako, while another soldier pointed his gun at Tibor, who was taken there already frozen, as a hostage, to persuade the surrender of the remaining crew of the Science II. “If you make a move, we’ll shoot Tibor.” Merko said, pointing a laser gun at him. Sivoc and Drako stopped and were also frozen. Crom went toward Zara’s room to catch the doctor. “What do you want now? Haven’t you got exactly what you wanted? You imprisoned Nicolas, who was under our care, when our mission was almost accomplished.” “You’ll sleep on this ship for one year, doctor. When you get to planet Vida, we’ll have already finished the mission and you won’t be on our way. Commander Merko and I will be promoted by saving Princess Isadora.” “You’re crazy. Don’t you know that the adviser Mirov is not a trustworthy person? He’s selfish, wicked and will certainly sacrifice the earthling. Please, Crom, don’t do it. You and Merko will regret for delivering a helpless earthling to Mirov like a worm.” “You don’t know what you’re saying, Zara. The purpose of our mission is to save the princess, and Mirov himself will take care of it. We won’t hurt the earthling.” After that, Crom pointed his cryogenic gun at Zara and froze her within seconds. He put his hand on her and they teleported to the control room, where all the crewmembers of Science II were already frozen. Merko and his team took everyone to the cryogenic chambers, which were used for long trips to preserve the bodies and keep them alive until the arrival. They scheduled the unfreezing and the revitalization of the crew for a year and, so, they also planned Science II for the trip. Merko and the others returned to their ship. *** Nicolas tried to speak with Zara again, but with no success. He didn’t know that from now on he was alone and unprotected, but he felt a little pain in his chest as if something was wrong. Crom took Challenge I to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a place known as Mariana Trench, more than eleven thousand meters deep. There, any team that could be looking for them wouldn’t reach them, and it would be possible to wait for the right time for the long-awaited return to their planet. Merko asked Crom to contact his master on the planet Vida and tell him they were on their way. *** Mirov was anxious. Everything was happening as he had planned. He would sabotage the bone marrow transplant that would save Princess Isadora and would kill the earthling during the procedure blaming the surgeons. With the death of Princess Isadora, the King would go into depression and would be weakened. Then, he would ask to his servant, infiltrated on the personal service of the king, to poison him. So, there would be only Kenan as an obstacle, but this one wouldn’t cause him trouble, because he was old. He would let the counselor rot in a prison and would take all the power for himself. Nobody knew Mirov’s plans, not even Merko, who was loyal to Zador’s Kingdom and he believed he was only efficiently following the orders of the King. Despite eliminate his opponents in his mission, and leave no traces of this presence, Merko always wanted to perform his jobs effectively and with responsibility. He had qualities like honor and respect, and devoted his life to his King. He planned to freeze and postpone the trip Science II’s crew to avoid obstructions to his plan and to immobilize his rivals in that mission. He couldn’t imagine, however, that he was helping a traitor.",

They positioned the Challenge I beside it and entered the Science II teleporting themselves, but nobody was there. With a paralyzing gun, they left the robot dog, Little Wolf, out of action. Only his eyes were moving from side to side watching the movements of the invaders. That was when Merko said: “Crom, check in the central computer the last location they were transported from the ship. There must be some record of their position.” So, they managed to know what would be the next step: to follow the coordinates of the teleportation position registered in the ship. However, Drako had placed false records of latitude and longitude on the computers boards in order to distract them. Merko and his team didn’t anticipate the intelligence of the Information System’s expert and headed to the places indicated in the ship’s computer, moving away from the ones they were pursuing. The trick used by Drako was a way for Sivoc’s team to gain some time and hide while waiting for the opening day of the wormhole near Calisto moon, where intergalactic positions would become perfect for the trip back. Merko and his soldiers looked around and realized they were in the Red Square, the tourist site most famous and visited of Russia. The big streets of Moscow starting on this square and were heading to several places. They observed many tourists who admired the beauties of the place. The tour guides showed all the buildings around, which were historically important. Merko and the others put the infrared glasses to find signs of transmuted people, but couldn’t see them. They walked through the crowd with their sunglasses and didn’t detect the presence of their targets. “Mr. Commander, I can’t understand why they would come to this place so far from home and from the boys country. I observed in other records of the ship, and the places don’t make sense. Istanbul in Turkey, Tokyo in Japan...” “You don’t need to continue. Drako had duped us. He’s very smart and I didn’t think that this hunt would be easy. Let’s go back to our ship and think of some strategy. We need a better plan to find them.” *** Without achieving success in finding them, Merko again decided to contact Mirov, the organizer and advisor of his mission. “Counselor, I’d like to know if you got any other information about the target. We’re very close to it, but your help would be of great value at this time.” “Merko, give me a few hours to try to gather as much information as possible. I’ll contact you as soon as possible.” “I’m waiting for new information, counselor.” After some hours, Mirov returned the contact with good news. “Radof only got some information in the Royal Palace. They are in the country where the earthling lives, but that was the only thing I could discover. Certainly they’re hidden.” “Understood, Mr. Counselor. I’ll use this information the best way I can. We’ll find the earthling soon and we’ll succeed in our mission.” With this, they realized how difficult it would be to find them. They wouldn’t reveal themselves so easily and were certainly taking all the necessary precautions to remain hidden. Merko decided to trace a research strategy to track them. *** For the luck of Sivoc’s crew, they were all hidden. Sivoc, Drako and Zara rested in the apartment while Nicolas and Tibor trained in the martial arts academy. Sivoc was quiet, listening to classical music, which came from the radio and felt like it was penetrating deep into his soul making him relax. It was a symphony of Beethoven. “Simply a magnificent work of art!” He thought. The apartment in which he and his crew lived was large, with three bedrooms. The living room had the walls painted in the color of sand, with a comfortable sofa and a recliner. In his bedroom, there was a large window with a wonderful view of the city, where they spend a lot of time watching the frantic “coming and going” of the people. Living there, waiting for the days to go by, he never imagined that his rival Merko was searching at all the databases for any information, no matter how small, to look for the place where they were hidden. Crom, using regular tools of search, found some news about the episode that occurred in New York with the gang who levitated and remained suspended in a tree. The strange event caught the attention of the sensationalist media and was reported in all major newspapers online. Noticing that this was important evidence, he ran to his commandant and questioned him: “Mr. Merko, I think I found some important information about our target. Look at this fact in the city of New York.” “Brilliant, Captain Crom. A couple that imprisoned bandits by levitating them. It sounds like telekinesis. But how is it possible? The members of Science II don’t have this power. However, this fact is obviously related to them. Hurry, prepare all men. We’ll teleport ourselves there. I’m sure we’ll find more clues about Sivoc and his crew.” *** Merko and his team were in New York to try to find Nicolas. As the episode found in the newspapers had happened in Central Park, they decided to start their search there. They were all dressed with a costume that would make them go unnoticed amidst the crowd: jeans, blazers and black shoes. All the information about the clothing of the time and place had been obtained in the database of the ship. “Merko, we need to observe how they live here so we can create a capture plan. While we look for someone in the crowd, we can already devise strategies to make the capture as soon as we find them.” Crom said. “Okay. I know this is you specialty and I trust the task to you.” Merko replied. They spent hours in the park every day, observing the movement of people with their infrared glasses, which would reveal if there were a transmuted among them. After several days of observation, during which Merko’s men were positioned in strategic places to get a better reach and a larger view of the park, they saw a man with the red image showing heat and radiation. It was the signal that they needed to detect a transmuted. They observed the man, who entered into a food store and it was Drako. He looked everywhere and, although he was using his infrared glasses, he couldn’t distinguish his tormentors in front of an intense crowd. At the same time, the men of the Alpha-Omega team were also setting up a stakeout in several places of the city, but only the agent Netil had the glasses, a unique pair they had stolen from Silion, the alien captured years earlier. Even using reverse engineering they weren’t capable to copy the equipment. Thus, Alpha-Omega team had greater difficulty in the search for the aliens, because with only a pair of glasses, they couldn’t scan a very large area, so they would need to wait for some extraordinary event to reveal the presence of visitors from space. With a distance, Crom followed Drako for several blocks, taking great care not to be seen. He realized that he also carried the glasses and he had to be very cautious in his pursuit. Still hidden, he saw Drako entering a building, probably the apartment where he and his team were hiding. Crom reported to Merko, informing the location. After a brief meeting, during which an alien continued to peek the building, they decided that the best thing to do was to observe that place day and night, because it was certainly Sivoc’s hideout, so, they would find Nicolas there. It would be necessary surveillance of twenty-four hours, so all the movements could be detected and they could trace all the details of the routine of the residents of the building. After a few days, they knew exactly what the routine of every member of Science II was. Merko didn’t want to wait much longer, because he knew that in a few days they would have to cross the space-time passage. He left two soldiers guarding Sivoc, Drako and Zara, and decided to invade the gym where Nicolas and Tibor were, along with Crom and another soldier. *** One of Merko’s soldiers had already followed Nicolas and Tibor to the gym which they attended every day and had the coordinates of the location. After making sure that everything was right and informing its plans once again to Crom and the soldier would go with him, Merko and his companions teleported to the place. He saw the earthling entering the academy of fights, followed by Tibor. When Nicolas was training, Tibor came to him and said: “I’m having a bad feeling, boy. Whatever it is, if there is a problem, try to teleport yourself next to Zara, because she’ll know what to do.” Some seconds after Tibor’s warning, the three men invaded the academy. Alex approached one of them and asked who they were, but Merko, without listening, struck him in his throat. He moved away and continued to fight. Tibor asked Nicolas to get away and soon he was facing Crom, while Merko didn’t take his eyes off his main target, the earthling whose special defense cells were interesting to the inhabitants of the planet Vida. Tibor quickly sent a telepathic signal of danger to everyone from his team and started fighting with Crom. The fight seemed endless because of their mutual capacity. Tibor managed to immobilize Crom with a technical arm lock, a blow often used by the police to immobilize and knock out their opponent. Crom fell unconscious on the floor. Nicolas struggled with one of the soldiers and also managed to knock him down, but Merko got rid of Alex and quickly got to the earthling. When the young man grabbed him by the arm, the experienced soldier reversed the advantage by bending his arm and holding his neck with two fingers of his right hand, leaving him unconscious. “Tibor, you should be one of my officers!” Merko said. “I don’t agree with your methods.” Tibor replied promptly. The two of them approached, after Merko laid the unconscious Nicolas carefully in one of the closest walls. First, the commander tried a Kung-fu blow in Tibor’s throat, but his defense of Karate-do with the top of his right hand, threw a blow in Merko’s stomach. Despite the great skill of his opponent, Merko prepared an attack that no one had managed to escape before. It was an advanced blow, Aikido style. Tibor tried to hit him at the height of his liver, but his opponent turned around holding his arm, making him to hit his head against the wall and fall unconscious. Meanwhile, the members of the academy watched it all, perplexed, and thought it was a workout or some demonstration. They only noticed realized that the attacks were serious when Merko looked at them and pulled his laser gun, scaring them all and making them flee in terror. “Commander, we’d better stop now.” Crom warned Merko when he saw that everybody of the academy was running for their lives. He was getting up slowly; still dazed by the blow he had received. “The situation is already under control and we can’t catch even more attention to our existence. We need to get out of here quickly.” They used only the paralyzing rays to immobilize those who were present and to avoid major problems. They synchronized their watches to get out of there soon. Merko was furious because he didn’t like to leave witnesses to his actions during missions, but he remained silent. He, Crom, and the soldier who came as a support, teleported themselves to the ship carrying Nicolas as prisoner. The boy woke up inside the ship, on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. He looked through the window of the living room where he was and saw sharks and stingrays swimming around. He woke up a bit confused, but gradually began to remember what had happened in the gym. The air in the room was very clean; it seemed composed only of oxygen, which provided him a good sensation when breathing. Soon, however, his attention turned to the place where he was and he could notice that it was some kind of compartment of the ship similar to a bedroom. There was very few furniture, with only one place to lie and another one to sit, both with the shape that allowed the perfect fitting of a person. Nicolas was still watching the place of his captivity, when he heard somebody asking for permission to enter. “Welcome to Challenge I!” At this moment, Nicolas realized he was a prisoner and that his life could be in danger. The conversation was telepathic and the boy couldn’t avoid listening. “Looks like you really like technology. In the future we have the most powerful computers ever seen. But the telepathy used among us, from Planet Vida, and other powers of the mind that you do not know, can only be used by us and not by machines. It is a power inherent to the nature of our thoughts. To let the machines think can be very dangerous.” He paused for a moment, because he noticed the curious eyes of the young man. “I was forgetting to introduce myself; I am Commander Merko, from the planet Vida. As for you, there’s no need to presentations. We all know you.” “I haven’t heard good things about you.” Nicolas replied, frowning, not feeling comfortable with the unexpected presence of his visitor. “I don’t intend to please people. I want to have my job well done. Get comfortable, because in a few days, we’ll travel to planet Vida.” His tormentor left the room and the automatic door closed soon after his departure. Nicolas was scared. As soon as the commander exited, he felt his capacity was recovered. He had been stunned after the fight in the gym and a bit confused to see himself in a strange place. The shock of the unexpected encounter with the feared commander Merko, but, he cleared his mind. The boy was afraid with his imprisonment and wanted to get out of there anyway. He created many plans of escape in his thoughts, but the truth is that he didn’t know the ship Challenge and wouldn’t be easy to leave. Finally, he chose to use telekinesis, which, although it left him extremely tired, was the only trick he had. He concentrated on the objects he saw in the room and made them move to test the powers trained with Tibor. He moved the bed, which was released from the wall, and a table that levitated from the ground. He made them both spin. Then placed them back in their positions and felt himself in control of his mental strength. He looked at the door and opened it. Not very confident, but hopeful, he began to walk through the halls of the ship, slowly and scared, he thought about how he would manage to escape. Another door stood before him and, again he managed to open it. Behind the door, however, a tall shadow denounced Merko’s presence, which surprised the boy in time of the escape. He quickly looked at him, holding his arm tightly. “How did you escape from the room? The door was programmed for you not to leave.” Said the commander, confused to see the earthling wandering through the corridors of the ship. “Reading your mind I can figure out what happened.” Nicolas tried to use his telekinesis to move Merko up, but the commander seemed to annul his strength. He felt Merko invading his mind and was unable to hide his thoughts. “I see I’m not the only one who has the power of telekinesis. A simple earthling with such skill, how can it be? This is very strange.” The commander continued to analyze Nicolas’ mind, looking for answers, but he found out that the boy knew nothing about the source of his powers. He decided to put him it in the room again, but this time he prepared a prison with laser bars, that wouldn’t allow a new opportunity. “Somehow, the earthling managed to acquire the power of telekinesis and almost escaped.” Said Merko to Crom when he returned to the control room, after leaving the earthling trapped in the new cell immune to telekinesis. “How is it possible, Commander? I thought you were the one who had this ability.” “I definitely don’t know. When we get to planet Vida, I’ll ask our scientists to discover what happened to him. I won’t rest until we find out his secret.” Merko showed great concern over the discovery. He gesticulated a lot and seemed very nervous. He had never known anyone else who had this ability. “From what I noticed in his mind, not even he knows the source of his power. We’ll take him in safety and save our princess, this is our priority. Then, we’ll solve the other problem. I won’t allow anyone to have such power.” “The space-time gap will open in three Earth days, Commander.” “We need to prepare the ship for the voyage, Crom. Order the computer to analyze and optimize all operating systems immediately.” Merko said. Nicolas stood alone and realized that he was a prisoner, and the place wasn’t just a room but a cell. The furniture were embedded on the wall, in niches proportional to their sizes, where they automatically entered after being used. Nicolas’ sense of admiration for the ship’s technologies was shared with his fears, and how much he missed Zara and his family. “What happened to Zara and my friends? Are they alive?” He pondered. Sometimes, during the day, Merko went to the earthling’s room to make sure everything was okay. He worried about his health, because he had to take him in good conditions for the surgery. After the escape attempt, he was also interested in studying him, because the power of the earthling surprised him. XIV. Waiting for the Trip Sivoc, Drako and Zara arrived at the gym and there was Tibor, unconscious and lying on the ground. Around him, several students were unconscious; some of them seemed not to be breathing anymore. “Take care of Tibor and the others who are alive, we need to get out of here as soon as possible.” Sivoc said. “Why did you take so long?” Tibor asked while standing up. He was still quite dizzy and a little confused. “There were two men of Merko’s team watching us. I asked help to Drako and we managed to neutralize them, but it cost us some time that seemed very precious. We used laser handcuffs and imprisoned them in our apartment.” Sivoc replied. “Now, what do we do?” Zara asked, feeling anxious. “We’ll remove any trace of our presence here on Earth and return home, to outline a new plan. In three days, the portal will open near the planet Jupiter and the Calisto moon and we need to get to planet Vida along with Merko’s team. Nicolas’ life is in danger, because we don’t know what they will do after the removal of his bone marrow. Certainly, Councilor Mirov won’t obey the order of King Zador II to bring the earthling back to Earth safely.” Sivoc said. Tibor teleported himself first and was resting in the ship, recovering from the fight and from his injuries, while the others finished all the necessary adjustments for the departure. “Drako, did you manage to warn the emergency services to come to the academy and help the wounded?” Asked Zara. “Affirmative, doctor. I have taken all the necessary arrangements. There is no way to track us and everyone had been advised.” As they prepared to leave, the Alpha-Omega team entered the academy, Collin, Ann, and several Special Forces soldiers of the American army. With the special infrared glasses, Collin had followed the aliens, what led them directly to the place of the struggle. When they notice the aliens were still there, they began to use weapons of electrical discharge to try to immobilize and possibly capture them. Collin and Sivoc began a body fight, and Zara teleported herself holding agent Ann behind. Drako used a weapon of sound waves he had pulled from underneath his jacket and the soldiers fell to the ground. Sivoc managed to dominate the agent who fainted. Then Drako and Sivoc looked at agent Ann, who raised her arms and surrendered. Sivoc didn’t want Zara to fight because it was risky for the embryo she carried in her womb. They used a sleeping radius in everyone and a white smoke covered the environment of the academy while they returned to the ship. *** Sivoc’s team fled immediately. They knew that the military reinforcements were on the way. They removed any sign of their presence in New York and decided to teleport themselves to the ship, where they would finish the preparations for the trip. They also needed to verify if the ship had been found by Merko or had been sabotaged. They took the two soldiers of Merko’s team they had imprisoned in Sivoc’s apartment and put them in a cell in the ship Science II. They couldn’t let the m behind on the planet at the mercy of the extraterrestrial capture agents. “Where is Nicolas?” After ensuring the safety of everyone who was present, Zara couldn’t stop thinking about him. They must be waiting for the opening of the wormhole somewhere on the planet. Our chance to save the boy will be to follow them to the planet Vida.” Sivoc replied. “Somehow I feel that he is alive”, thought the doctor. The Science II had been carefully checked, in every single detail, so everyone’s safety could be guaranteed. Zara was the first to realize that Little Wolf had been immobilized. So, everyone knew that Merko and his men had been there. “Certainly he used the computers of the ship to try to find our coordinates of teleport. But Drako camouflaged the data, I have no idea how they managed to find us. What it’s really weird, however, is the fact that they let us live. It doesn’t match with Merko’s methods.” Sivoc concluded. Drako prepared the ship for the voyage back to their planet and repaired the robot dog. He searched for some information on the nature of the monitors that could show what the plans of Merko were, but there was nothing important in the records about his presence. Zara went to her room and began to telepathically focus, hoping to establish contact with her love. She couldn’t lose hope of finding him alive and well. *** Merko’s military ship wasn’t far from Science II. Inside the vehicle, Nicolas was also focused, doing the meditation exercises taught by Tibor. There wasn’t much to do as a prisoner and this was his only hope, although it was small, to get some contact with his friends. “Nick, can you hear me?” Zara said, telepathically. “Yes, I can hear you, Zara! I’m so relieved to get some contact with you. I was already losing hope, because I’m trying to communicate for hours.” “Are you all right, my dear? Are you badly injured?” “I’m fine. I’m not hurt, but I’m locked in a cell.” “On Merko’s ship?” “Exactly.” Nicolas confirmed. “I’m somewhere on the bottom of the sea. There are fish and marine animals everywhere. I can’t say more than that. But where are you?” The communication between the two was difficult due to the presence of many rocks in place. It didn’t matter to Nicolas and Zara, because they were both calmer knowing they were fine. However, they couldn’t imagine that Challenge I and Science II were so close, because Merko’s plan was to capture Sivoc and his team and freeze them when they were together. “I’m in the ship Science II.” “Zara, are you okay? Is Tibor there with you?” “He is Nick. Tibor is still a little stunned, but he had no serious injuries. We are all fine here in the ship.” “Zara, I’m afraid! Can you help me?” “We can’t know what your exact location is, but we will try to reach you on our planet. Take care and be quiet, Merko is very dangerous. We will do everything we can to rescue you, Nick.” Zara replied. *** Merko managed to telepathically intercept the communication between the earthling and Zara and knew that the crew of the Science II had already arrived. He immediately called Crom and two other men to invade the ship and capture the crew. They materialized in the infirmary of the ship Science II and, with a pistol, they froze Tibor, who was resting and recovering from his injuries. “One less, Commander.” Crom said. “Let’s get the others.” “Crom, proceed with discretion. The surprise will be our greatest ally.” They went to the engineering room and turned off the entire propulsion system of the ship, inactivating it for the flight. They also released the other two soldiers of their team who had been imprisoned. “Sir, I programmed the ship to restart the engines in one Earth year, according to your plan.” Sivoc was with Drako in the control room when all the systems turned off. Everything went dark, and the emergency lights lit, leaving the place dimly illuminated. Drako, realizing that something was wrong, had the brilliant idea to turn off the Little Wolf for the programmed period of a day. If anything happened, the robot would return to its active duty on the next day and could follow the rescue protocol configured on its system. Within minutes, Merko, Crom and his soldiers were in the control room. They pointed their guns at Sivoc and Drako, while another soldier pointed his gun at Tibor, who was taken there already frozen, as a hostage, to persuade the surrender of the remaining crew of the Science II. “If you make a move, we’ll shoot Tibor.” Merko said, pointing a laser gun at him. Sivoc and Drako stopped and were also frozen. Crom went toward Zara’s room to catch the doctor. “What do you want now? Haven’t you got exactly what you wanted? You imprisoned Nicolas, who was under our care, when our mission was almost accomplished.” “You’ll sleep on this ship for one year, doctor. When you get to planet Vida, we’ll have already finished the mission and you won’t be on our way. Commander Merko and I will be promoted by saving Princess Isadora.” “You’re crazy. Don’t you know that the adviser Mirov is not a trustworthy person? He’s selfish, wicked and will certainly sacrifice the earthling. Please, Crom, don’t do it. You and Merko will regret for delivering a helpless earthling to Mirov like a worm.” “You don’t know what you’re saying, Zara. The purpose of our mission is to save the princess, and Mirov himself will take care of it. We won’t hurt the earthling.” After that, Crom pointed his cryogenic gun at Zara and froze her within seconds. He put his hand on her and they teleported to the control room, where all the crewmembers of Science II were already frozen. Merko and his team took everyone to the cryogenic chambers, which were used for long trips to preserve the bodies and keep them alive until the arrival. They scheduled the unfreezing and the revitalization of the crew for a year and, so, they also planned Science II for the trip. Merko and the others returned to their ship. *** Nicolas tried to speak with Zara again, but with no success. He didn’t know that from now on he was alone and unprotected, but he felt a little pain in his chest as if something was wrong. Crom took Challenge I to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a place known as Mariana Trench, more than eleven thousand meters deep. There, any team that could be looking for them wouldn’t reach them, and it would be possible to wait for the right time for the long-awaited return to their planet. Merko asked Crom to contact his master on the planet Vida and tell him they were on their way. *** Mirov was anxious. Everything was happening as he had planned. He would sabotage the bone marrow transplant that would save Princess Isadora and would kill the earthling during the procedure blaming the surgeons. With the death of Princess Isadora, the King would go into depression and would be weakened. Then, he would ask to his servant, infiltrated on the personal service of the king, to poison him. So, there would be only Kenan as an obstacle, but this one wouldn’t cause him trouble, because he was old. He would let the counselor rot in a prison and would take all the power for himself. Nobody knew Mirov’s plans, not even Merko, who was loyal to Zador’s Kingdom and he believed he was only efficiently following the orders of the King. Despite eliminate his opponents in his mission, and leave no traces of this presence, Merko always wanted to perform his jobs effectively and with responsibility. He had qualities like honor and respect, and devoted his life to his King. He planned to freeze and postpone the trip Science II’s crew to avoid obstructions to his plan and to immobilize his rivals in that mission. He couldn’t imagine, however, that he was helping a traitor.",

      "content": "– XV. The Arrival at Planet Vida – The ship Challenge I emerged from the sea and flew at a super speed towards the opening timeline that was formed between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. It traveled in propulsion, with the engines of space warp. In the control room, Crom said: “Mr. Commander, we achieved a good pass and approached our planet. Let’s prepare for the arrival.” *** Nicolas looked through a window formed by a material similar to glass and contemplated the wonders of the Universe. When they approached the planet Vida, the boy gasped admiring the solar system, which was the new home of mankind. He saw how the planet Vida was similar to Earth. “They always said that there were planets similar to ours, but this is too equal, even with water in abundant quantities. I see forests, waterfalls and different birds flying between the trees; flowers of many qualities and beautiful mountains creating landscapes like the ones in Earth and the ocean surrounding the continent. And that’s weird... apparently the continent is only one, like in the early days of our planet.” He shared feelings of fear, anguish and admiration in his mind and heart. He didn’t know what would happen from there, because Zara was no longer at his side with her friends to protect him. He was alone and feared what the future would hold. *** In the ship Sicence II, one day after the freezing of the crew, the bright eyes of Little Wolf lit a red light. He searched for Drako throughout the ship and didn’t find him. The smart robot dog launched a holographic image with radar that came from his muzzle and saw the signs of the presence of the four-crew members of the ship in the laboratory. He went there and the door opened. He observed them frozen in their cryogenic chambers for a few seconds. He looked at Drako, groaned and pressed the button to open the chamber with his right foot. Drako began to unfreeze, regaining his consciousness, coughing. Wet, he rose scared. “What happened? Little Wolf... You... What a good dog! Thank you. Let’s unfreeze the others.” Drako began to release the other and soon they were all ready and gathered to plan a way to save Nicolas. Sivoc ordered Drako: “Go to the engineering room and connect all the ship’s systems. We need to prepare our departure immediately. The portal is now open, and we need to take advantage to travel as soon as possible. Congratulations, Drako, for the brilliant idea to program Little Wolf to release us. Our chances of saving the Nicolas and Princess Isadora increased due to this.” “Thanks to Little Wolf and Drako, we’ll have the opportunity to reach Merko’s ship. Tibor, let’s go to the infirmary. I need to take care of you.” Zara said. The ship Science II departed for the planet Vida and approached the orbit of the planet, Sivoc contacted the advisor Kenan. “Mr. Counselor, we’ve arrived to our planet.” “Is the earthling with you?” Asked Kenan. “No, sir. Merko’s team intercepted us and now Nicolas is under his custody.” “Certainly Mirov has a plan in mind for the earthling. We need to find out what it is.” Said the Counselor, concerned. *** In the king’s palace, they reported that the earthling had arrived, and he was very hopeful. Isadora was in his bed, and the king was watching her in her sleep. He thought how beautiful she was. She seemed to smile while sleeping and let out soft gasps during sleep. So, the king called Kenan and said: “Please, make a report of the situation. I want to know how the earthling is and when we begin the preparations for the surgery.” “Your majesty, I’ll bring all the answers as soon as possible.” Answered Kenan, who quickly searched for Mirov to ask him about the earthling. “How are you, Mirov? I’ve heard that Merko and his team arrived from the planet Earth.” “Yes, Kenan. Everything went as planned. Merko and his entire team are fine, and the earthling is healthy and ready for the surgery.” Mirov replied. “I don’t understand why you took the earthling from Sivoc’s custody. You could have gathered your forces and helped the scientific team to accomplish their purpose. It wasn’t necessary the use of force in this mission, and the team of Science II had the situation under control. Instead of this, you acted with pride and calculation, risking the success of the plan.” Kenan said, closing his fists. “You know how commander Merko likes to act in his missions. The important thing is that he always fulfills his orders.” Mirov replied. “What matters now is the possibility to save the princess. Let’s start the preparations as soon as possible. I’ll give the orders for the surgical team to be ready to start anytime.” Kenan knew Zara would bring the genetic information of the earthling in her womb and was prepared for any nasty plan of Mirov. *** The king remained in his palace, walking from one side to the other, anxious about the possibility, now concrete, to save his beloved daughter. Tonight he couldn’t sleep. He took advantage of the insomnia to look to what his people had built over generations. The royal palace was a good example of how much they had evolved since the time from where the boy was coming. Everything was planned as a system of sustainable environment just like all the houses and apartments of the planet Vida. They used the maximum possible of glassy materials in its construction, with cells for absorption of solar energy. Miniature nuclear reactors for each housing unit ensured the necessary energy. All the water used on the entire planet was recycled. The integrity of this green technology was deployed all over the planet and not just in the palace. But the royal house had some perks too. The palace was the most luxurious place on planet Vida. It was a castle with three floors, big enough to house three thousand people. Even in the future, the monarchy favored the royal family. The main room had about a thousand square meters; it was gleaming and had many crystals. It was flanked by entries of corridors, which leaded to thirteen bedrooms, all prepared with luxury and comfort for guests and the royal family. The presence of gardens, trees, lakes and fountains provided the beauty to the outside part of the beautiful place. From the balcony of his room, the biggest in the palace, the king had a privileged view of a garden, which vegetation marveled those who could observe it. The front garden of the palace also had a large fountain around it, from which the big ships of visitors arrived to the palace. On the sky, the king observed the ships that worked with clean energy: they used cells of nuclear reactors of hydrogen that powered the entire fleet. Again the thoughts of the monarch turned to improvements experienced by his people. There was almost no private transport, to avoid the excess of traffic, what made the traffic jams almost nonexistent. All the green area of the planet was preserved, with reforestation and management of existing forests whenever necessary. However, this didn’t occur very often, because the use of paper was avoided to the maximum, the inhabitants of the planet used digital images and documents almost exclusively. The security for the inhabitants of the planet was also quite effective. Police used paralyzing rays, and the prisons weren’t overcrowded, they functioned as centers of rehabilitation and work with for those few who were sent there. Only soldiers used weapons, and, even then, such use was not so frequent. Education, health and safety had improved much in comparison to the past. In contrast, the psychological problems of the future human beings had increased, maybe because the society was more open and prone to treatments and because of some prejudice in the past. They evolved a lot until they accept to talk about their mental problems without fear. This was one of the major problems of this society. Fortunately, the health system was very good and could treat all the cases of psychological problems of the planet’s inhabitants. The king sighed hopeful. The planet Vida was progressing in a way that made him proud. He knew he was a good monarch and was doing everything in his power to make the lives of his servants easier and enjoyable. Besides, he also guaranteed, with the help of his advisers that all measures of ecological prevention were taken in order to keep the environment in which they lived healthy. And he always reinforced it with awareness programs the importance of the environmental preservation with those who lived in Vida. Now, the only problem for which they still hadn’t found any solution would be solved. His beloved daughter would be healed and he could live in peace. He couldn’t wait to see the result of the surgery.",

      "content": "– XVI. In King Zador’s Palace – Nicolas was in a room in the building of the advisors, beside the royal palace, when Mirov and Kenan came to meet him. He kept his alien form not to contradict Merko. The boy was anxious to leave his condition of prisoner. The counselors entered his room, which was watched by two security guards. “So, earthling, how was the trip?” Kenan asked to break the ice. “Sivoc’s team treated me with great respect and education. Merko brutally fought with us and imprisoned me in his ship. I think you should look for Zara and the others, they may be in trouble or in danger.” Nicolas did not trust anyone at this point, based on Merko’s actions he felt he could be among enemies. “We brought him here in order to save our princess with his defense cells, as you should already know.” Kenan said to the counselor. “Zara explained everything to me and I promptly accepted to do everything I can to help. However, now I’m full of doubts about the true purpose of my visit to this planet.” “Wanting or not you have no other option than to help us. “ Mirov declared. “Please, Mirov, this is not how we do things here.” Kenan wanted to calm the earthling down and show that the inhabitants of Vida were good hosts and never wanted to harm him. “The kid must be comfortable, and stress wouldn’t help to keep his cellular defenses healthy. The king would never approve to force the earthling against his will.” “Kenan, you don’t need to give me moral lessons. I just want to finish what we started and save the princess.” Mirov replied with a silly look. “I hope you have in mind that I am also a human being and I have the right to express my will.” The boy interrupted, annoyed with the discussion, which seemed to exclude him, and afraid about what they could do with him. “I intend, however, to help healing the princess.” “There’s no need to rush, all the preparations are being made for everything to happen as perfectly as possible.” Mirov said, staring into Nicolas’ eyes. “We’re not being educated, we forgot to introduce ourselves. I’m Kenan, and this one beside me and is Mirov.” Kenan said, showing the counselor at his side. “We are the king Zador II’s counselors, who would like to meet you too. It is a pleasure to welcome you on our planet.” “It will be my pleasure to help your princess. I just want to be treated like the human being I am, with respect and dignity.” Said Nicolas, feeling a little angered by the treatment he had been receiving since Merko’s team captured him. “I apologize and ask for your comprehension because of the situation we’re going through. We are all concerned about the life of our princess, which is hanging by a thread. You are the one who can save her, our last hope.” Explained Kenan while Mirov just frowning, watching the conversation. “You are a guest here on our planet, so you can consider yourself as a free human being. We’ll be more careful now to show our true hospitality. We’re a very welcoming people, and you’ll be very well treated here in Vida. I only ask you not to leave the royal palace, because we need to protect you and keep you healthy for the surgery. I believe you want to meet the members of the Science II again.” “But how...?” Mirov interrupted. “Where are they? I thought they were still on planet Earth.” “They had just arrived safe and sound here on the planet.” Kenan looked at Nicolas with a smile and then turned to face his partner on the royal council. “Why did you get so surprised, Mirov? Would there be any reason for them not being here?” Mirov was speechless and just nodded with his head negatively. He was furious for being insulted in front of the earthling and to know that Science II was back to the planet. He needed to do whatever was possible to follow through with his original plan and get the throne. Nicolas was thrilled with the possibility to see Zara, and relieved that his friends from Science II were well and safe on the same planet as him. After being trapped by the commander Merko, he thought he would never see the woman who was now the reason of his existence, or any of his new friends. He was anxiously waiting for this moment. *** Then, Kenan, Mirov and Nicolas went to the royal palace along with the security guards. They were greeted by a royal reception and Nicolas noticed that the king and his daughter were waiting to meet him. Zador II was short and wore a golden robe that covered his slender back. His chin seemed more tapered than the other of the inhabitants of Vida. He wore no crown. As a symbol of his power he held a golden bat in his hands. His face was grayish-white and his glace seemed tired, due to his daughter health problems. The girl was even thinner, but very beautiful. She was lying in a bed beside her father’s seat and stood up as soon as the visitor came close. Nicolas could see she was a very frail girl with curious blue eyes that showed her will to live, but were flanked by heavy dark circles which revealed the terrible disease the girl was struggling. On the next week would be her birthday, and the best present was the recovery of her health. “Hello, Nicolas, nice to meet you. I’m Princess Isadora. I hope you’re enjoying our planet and that you’re being well treated here. “Nice to meet you, Nicolas. I’m the king Zador II, ruler of the planet Vida that hosts you now. My dear young man, excuse us for bringing you for the future like this, but we really need your help. I’ve heard that Merko escorted you, and he, sometimes, overreact in his attitudes.” “It is a pleasure to meet you, your Royal Highness, Princess.” Nicolas took a little bow to the girls, who immediately lie down on her bed again. She looked extremely fragile. He turned to the king and took a slightly longer bow. “It’s a pleasure to be in your presence, your majesty. The staff of Sivoc, who found me on Earth first, treated me very well. They explained the situation of the princess and my greatest desire is to help in every way possible. That’s what I told them when they asked me about my will. However, since Merko captured me, I lost my freedom, which is so dear to me, and I’ve been treated as a prisoner, which displeases me a lot. I believe the best for Merko and his team would be to collaborate with Sivoc, I’d have come to planet Vida very willingly to help your daughter. I just wish to be free at this time. I have no reason to run away. Besides, I don’t know how to return to the past, or to my galaxy.” “My daughter and I would like you to have dinner with us tonight. It would be a pleasure to welcome you in the palace, Nicolas. You’re free here in this planet and we’ll only protect you to maintain your integrity and ensure the success of the mission.” Said the king. “I don’t want you to think you’re a prisoner and I apologize for any oversight of our search teams. The eagerness to bring the solution to the princess’ problem may have hindered the way they treated you. “Apologies accepted your majesty. It will be a pleasure to dine at your company.” *** In the scientific building, which stood near the royal palace, Sivoc, Zara, Drako and Tibor were gathered to decide what to do. “Sivoc, what do you think it will happen now with Nicolas?” Asked Zara. “I don’t know, but judging by how Merko took him from us on Earth, anything can happen. On the other hand, I think Merko wanted to bring him safety to the planet Vida and fulfill the mission for which he was assigned. The greatest danger lies in the intentions of director Mirov. This man is unpredictable.” “And what can we do to help you?” Asked the doctor. “We have to be aware of this surgery and try to protect the earthling.” Said the commander. “Let’s go, Tibor. You, Drako, Zara and me will talk to the king and explain everything that happened. Counselor Kenan will certainly hear us.” *** They went to the royal palace, but were prevented from entering by the officers who were guarding the entrance. “You can’t enter the palace. These are Counselor Mirov’s orders.” Sivoc was stunned, because he always had free access to the palace. Telepathically he called Counselor Kenan and they stood waiting for him.” “Please, release the entry for these people. Sivoc and his team work with me.” Kenan arrived breathless, rushing to help his teammates. “The King is very satisfied and hopeful with Merko’s mission. What happened there? How did they manage to get the earthling from you?” “Mr. Counselor, Merko and his soldiers attacked us and took the earthling by force from our custody.” Told Sivoc. “He even killed some people in Earth, almost altering the course of history and disregarding the ethical rules of time travel. It seems strange to me that Counselor Mirov is giving orders preventing our entry into the palace. It was the first time this has happened since we began to work for the government.” “Very quirky and dangerous this attitude of Merko, but what makes me worried now is Mirov’s attitude. What is he planning? I don’t understand why he used so much force to perform this mission. When I heard that he took the earthling from your team, I questioned Counselor Mirov about his methods.” Kenan said. “I believe you’d be able to perfectly finish this mission without Merko’s intervention. I also don’t understand why Mirov doesn’t want you near the palace. I’ve already been suspicious of his attitudes for some time, so I asked Zara to prepare an alternative plan. But we’d better not talk about this for now. It’s our secret. I’ll take the case to the king, as soon as we finish the surgical process and we finally have the solution for the princess’ problem.” “We have to keep an eye on Counselor Mirov.” Sivoc said. “I fear that his intentions aren’t good and that Nicolas is in danger. We can put one of our men to protect the earthling with those who are already there to maintain his integrity and ensure the success of the mission.” “Okay, good idea, Sivoc. Who do you suggest, commandant?” “Tibor, with no doubt. He recovered from the fights against the crew and is already prepared to return to work. I trust him completely.” “Please, use the intelligence and avoid the use of force.” Replied the counselor. “Does anyone of you want to see Nicolas? I knew you became good friends. Of course Zara has one more reason, because she bears a fruit of his life inside her. Don’t comment about the child, not even telepathically. That would be very dangerous for everyone.” “Of course, sir.” Zara said. “None of us will mention the subject from now on, and we’ll be very discreet. I really wish to see Nicolas.” “To avoid problems, I think it would be better if only Zara saw him for a while. She will take the news that everyone is fine, and after the surgery the others will be able to see him too.” Zara looked at her friends, who nodded in agreement. Everyone knew that there was a bigger involvement between him and her, so, the first one to see him should be her. “I’ll be waiting in the garden in front of the palace.” Said the doctor. “Okay, Zara. I’ll be back to pick you up as soon as you receive the king’s permission for the visit. Tibor, I ask you to wait here as well, because I will put you as Nicolas’ bodyguard as soon as possible. The others are dismissed.” Everyone nodded while Kenan quickly returned to the palace. *** After dinner, Kenan approached the king and discreetly asked permission to take the earthling to meet Zara. “I’m glad they all came back fine. No doubt you have my permission. However, I ask that everyone should be getting ready for the big day tomorrow. Will Zara attend the surgery?” Asked the king. “No, your majesty. She is very tired because of the mission and needs to recover. However, I ask permission for Tibor to integrate Nicolas’ security team. He is a man full I trust completely and I believe it is necessary.” Kenan said. “Certainly, Counselor Kenan. I allow Tibor to integrate Nicolas’ security team. Ask him to accompany the earthling in his meeting with Zara. But it’s a brief encounter, because the kid is also tired from the trip and will have to face a complicated surgery tomorrow.” “Understood, your majesty. It will be a quick meeting. I myself will accompany him with Tibor.” *** Kenan and Tibor escorted Nicolas to the royal garden. Mirov, who followed them to the gate, but let them go when he saw Sivoc and his team at the palace entrance, observed them. Zara saw Nicolas coming in the alien form and got very happy, with a big smile, and tears came to her eyes. Nicolas ran and hugged her. “My dear, how I missed you!” Exclaimed the doctor. “Zara, I was desperate to see you. What about our son?” “It’s a daughter. We can’t mention this because it’s our secret and it can be dangerous.” “I hope she’s beautiful and smart like her mother.” “You’re very gentle.” Zara said smiling. “Everything’s alright with me and her, but from now we won’t talk about this anymore. Mirov has spies everywhere. We need to be discreet.” “Please, this meeting has to be brief.” Kenan interrupted. “The boy needs to rest for the surgery tomorrow. Tibor, you are now in charge of his safety. I’ll leave now and let you talk freely.” “Thank you for the opportunity, Counselor.” Zara said while Kenan was already leaving. “We’ll be together after my surgery and we have a lot to talk about.” Nicolas said. “Once we save the princess, I’d like you to come with me to Earth. We can’t change the fact that either here or over there, there will be a transformation of our destinies or maybe is our destiny to go through this transformation.” “I’ll go with you wherever you want. The sensation of losing you I had after Merko took you. I felt I must stay at your side. But it must stay between us. It is against our rules to become involved with people from the past and not change the history. But we can’t think about it now, because some of us can read minds, even without authorization. Let’s wait for right time to think about it.” Zara said. “It will be difficult, but I will try, and our daughter will be born on the planet Earth with us.” Nicolas replied, smiling. Sivoc and Drako just waved to Nicolas. “Drako, monitor all the communications from the palace, the Council and also from the scientific building. Do everything with secrecy. The king has already given permission for us to have the control of Nicolas’ security. Many lives depend on it. If there is any plan to undermine the success of the surgery, we have to figure out and fast, because soon they will begin the bone marrow transplant that will give the princess the blood cells to cure her. Tibor will be next to the earthling all the time to guarantee his safety. “All right, Commander.” *** The Alpha-Omega team of the U.S. government began to investigate the events that took place at gym. Many witnesses reported how the fights happened and the use of paralyzing guns caught the attention of everyone who was there. The research team of extraterrestrial cases quickly went to the place. Agent Netil and agent Soliver were investigating the surroundings in New York. There was no doubt that those technologies of paralyzing rays were not from Earth. The chief of the team himself, Mr. Ronald Steighen, decided to personally go to the place in search for alien remains. The event coincided with the use of antigravity in the prison of the Central Park’s gang. Some activity in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico was noticed by radar, but they found no traces of aliens in the region. The agents of the Alpha-Omega did everything but didn’t manage to find any alien or concrete proof of their visit. *** Journalist Andrew Thomas also attended the place and was prevented from taking pictures or interviewing people involved in the case. The press was prohibited from approaching, because they argued that the case was of national security nature. Andrew reported the fact to his boss, who told him: “There’s something very strange to prevent the work of the press. They said that people were motionless as statues and sophisticated weapons, that didn’t seem to be from our planet. How I wish I could find out the truth about these facts! Andrew, stay tuned for any chance to get information about this case. Don’t forget to investigate the levitation of the Central Park’s gang too. I’m foreseeing a connection between the two cases. It seems the end of a rope that, if pulled, it’ll bring us a great gift.” “Mr. Dither, I will do everything possible to investigate the facts and bring you good news.” *** In Mirov’s room, the counselor approached his assistant and said: “Radof, everything is set for the operation. Do your part as agreed. Enter the operating room and replace the marrow for the other I sent you. If needed, take someone else with you.” “Yes, sir. Merko is responsible for the security of the building where the surgery is being done. Since he’s subordinate to you, I believe that there will be problems.” Little did they know that their evil plan had been registered by the robot-bird placed by Drako to fly throughout Counselor Mirov’s room.",

      "content": "– XVI. In King Zador’s Palace – Nicolas was in a room in the building of the advisors, beside the royal palace, when Mirov and Kenan came to meet him. He kept his alien form not to contradict Merko. The boy was anxious to leave his condition of prisoner. The counselors entered his room, which was watched by two security guards. “So, earthling, how was the trip?” Kenan asked to break the ice. “Sivoc’s team treated me with great respect and education. Merko brutally fought with us and imprisoned me in his ship. I think you should look for Zara and the others, they may be in trouble or in danger.” Nicolas did not trust anyone at this point, based on Merko’s actions he felt he could be among enemies. “We brought him here in order to save our princess with his defense cells, as you should already know.” Kenan said to the counselor. “Zara explained everything to me and I promptly accepted to do everything I can to help. However, now I’m full of doubts about the true purpose of my visit to this planet.” “Wanting or not you have no other option than to help us. “ Mirov declared. “Please, Mirov, this is not how we do things here.” Kenan wanted to calm the earthling down and show that the inhabitants of Vida were good hosts and never wanted to harm him. “The kid must be comfortable, and stress wouldn’t help to keep his cellular defenses healthy. The king would never approve to force the earthling against his will.” “Kenan, you don’t need to give me moral lessons. I just want to finish what we started and save the princess.” Mirov replied with a silly look. “I hope you have in mind that I am also a human being and I have the right to express my will.” The boy interrupted, annoyed with the discussion, which seemed to exclude him, and afraid about what they could do with him. “I intend, however, to help healing the princess.” “There’s no need to rush, all the preparations are being made for everything to happen as perfectly as possible.” Mirov said, staring into Nicolas’ eyes. “We’re not being educated, we forgot to introduce ourselves. I’m Kenan, and this one beside me and is Mirov.” Kenan said, showing the counselor at his side. “We are the king Zador II’s counselors, who would like to meet you too. It is a pleasure to welcome you on our planet.” “It will be my pleasure to help your princess. I just want to be treated like the human being I am, with respect and dignity.” Said Nicolas, feeling a little angered by the treatment he had been receiving since Merko’s team captured him. “I apologize and ask for your comprehension because of the situation we’re going through. We are all concerned about the life of our princess, which is hanging by a thread. You are the one who can save her, our last hope.” Explained Kenan while Mirov just frowning, watching the conversation. “You are a guest here on our planet, so you can consider yourself as a free human being.

      "content": "– XVII. The Surgery – The big day arrived, and Nicolas was been carefully prepared for surgery. The best surgeons were chosen for the operation. The anesthesiologist put the mask over the nostrils of the earthling and he fell asleep while the anesthetic liquor was applied in one of the veins in his left arm. Then, he slept deeply and his life was placed in the hands of the best surgeons of the planet Vida. A red light lit on Merko’s sunglasses. He put them on, and a holographic image was projected in front of him. Mirov got in touch, ordering him to watch over the earthling, so that the whole plan could work with perfection. Drako intercepted the communication and immediately communicated Sivoc, who oriented Tibor to protect Nicolas. “Tibor, don’t stop watching the earthling. Don’t allow the entrance of anyone, and if Merko try anything, you have orders to disintegrate him. During yesterday’s dinner, we put a nano-robot with a super load of nano-explosives in commander Merko’s food. At this point, it must have adhered to the lining of his intestines, where it will remain for thirty- six hours before being expelled. Just push the booster pen that’s in your pocket and he’ll blow up. *** Already outside the operating room, Tibor looked at the laser pen, which was placed on his blouse and adjusted it carefully. “I’m sorry for what happened.” Said Merko approaching. “You know that I have to fulfill my missions and, for that, I’m capable of doing whatever it takes.” “Who knows? Maybe we’ll have a rematch...” Tibor said. “We need to protect the earthling, and this is our priority. My duty is to serve the king Zador II and I’ll do whatever it takes to help Princess Isadora.” “I have nothing against you, Tibor. On the contrary, I admire you for your loyalty and dedication. Let’s work together; I also yearn to serve my king.” Merko said. “Merko” Counselor Mirov said telepathically, communicating with the soldier “My servant will go to the operating room, under my orders, to see the boy. I want to make sure that the whole process will happen with no problems. Please offer protection and security to him.” “Tibor, another communication was made. Mirov sent his servant, Radof. He asked the help of Merko. Don’t let anyone enter the operating room. It’s an express order.” Drako said, communicating telepathically. It seemed that the rematch was imminent. While Merko and Tibor watched the surgery through a glass wall, apparently, everything was fine. The surgeons and nurses worked with perfection. Merko and Tibor watched and observed in the holographic screen in front of them, which showed the blood characteristics, blood pressure, the DNA of the defense cells of Nicolas and all his vital data. So, Merko looked at holography and stared at the DNA of the earthling’s white blood cells. “That’s weird... the purine and pyrimidine bases of the chromosome string of the white blood cells follow the same sequences than mine. It can’t be.” Merko said to himself. Merko knew his DNA’s strand because it was what he liked to study at the Military College: his own DNA sequence of his defense cells. “But this could only be possible if he was my son.” He thought again. He remembered Lorena, the night of love he had when he took the place of the major he killed. The age of the earthling coincided with the time of his visit on Earth. “This is my son! Now I understand why his form looks so much like my manners. I let him grow up without a father, abandoned his mother and yet he became a good human being.” Reflected Merko. Tibor realized that Merko was too agitated and decided to talk to him: “What’s going on?” “I’m sure this earthling is my son.” He said. “How can it be?” Tibor replied. “You must be joking.” But Tibor knew that Merko was a serious soldier, of few words, and didn’t used to make jokes. “It’s a long story. I executed a mission on Earth twenty-three years ago, before this earthling was born. I became involved with a woman in the same country where Nicolas lives and now I see the DNA of his defense cells in the holography, it’s very similar to mine. In the mission, I took the place of his father, a major in the U.S. Army, and I ended up having a relationship with his mother. Please, Tibor, that was my secret, you know we can’t relate to people from the past. This could ruin my career.” “There’s no doubt, he is your son. The DNA doesn’t lie.” Said a surprised Tibor. “You’re the first person I know who decorated its DNA sequence. About keeping secrets, don’t worry, that’s what I do best.” “It was my hobby in college, decorating the DNA sequence of my white blood cells. Although it’s rare, I have holographic memory. Thanks for keeping my secret. I still need to think about what I will do about it.” “I think we have a problem here, Merko. Drako informed me that Mirov ordered his servant to enter the room and swapped Nicolas’ marrow by another one that won’t save the princess.” Tibor said alarmed. Since Merko had trusted him to tell an important secret, he thought he could rely on the integrity of the commander to make him understand Mirov’s dark purposes. “Please, let’s work together and protect him. I ask for your help, Merko, because now it’s the safety of your son and the Princess Isadora. Let’s forget the past. The reason now is far more relevant to all of us and we are on the same side.” “I always dreamed of having a son. Now I understand how good is the feeling of being a father and the reason why this boy have such good defense, bearing the lymphocytes X. Probably it was the result of the miscegenation between the man of the past with the man of the future, combining their genetic.” Reflected Merko. “I can’t let the son I had just conquered take any risk.” “We have reasons to believe that Counselor Mirov doesn’t want the princess to be saved. That’s why we are monitoring the communications in the royal palace with the authorization of the monarch. We can’t allow the entrance of anyone. I was sent to protect the earthling.” Tibor said. Merko shook hands with Tibor and smiling, he said: “We’re on the same side. Consider me your friend. We’ll keep my son safe and ensure that the princess will receive what she needs to be healed.” *** In the operating room, Nicolas was quite sedated, and the operation was happening normally. The surgeons removed the bone marrow of the earthling and began the suture’s maneuvers. Meanwhile, other surgeons anesthetized princess Isadora, who was now sleeping deeply. “I received the order to prepare the sedation of the princess, because the earthling surgery is ending, and the material will be brought soon. We can start the first incisions and then move forward to the operation.” Said the surgeon chief. The doctors looked at the monitors positioned in haplographies and all the vital signs of the girl were in order. In the operating room of the earthling, the surgeons have completed the last suture, and the material removed from Nicolas was ready to be transported to the room where Isadora was. It was carefully placed in a container. The most delicate part of Nicolas’ operation had ended, but Isadora’s was just beginning. *** One of the surgeons took the material and waited to confirm the identity of who would carry it. He expected the final order of the surgeon chief, which chose the nurse and, for security reasons, he would summon him as soon as the patient was surgically prepared for transplantation. Mirov searched for information about the nurse. One of his spies identified who would collect the material, and Radof, after obtaining them, went to the nursing room and called him to warn that it was time to collect the material of the surgery and carry it to the room of the receiving patient. While the nurse walked down the hospital corridor, Radof stealthily approached as if he were escorting him and suddenly pushed him into a room. He disintegrated him with a laser, and, collecting his saliva, transmuted himself into the young man. Radof walked into the operating room taking the false marrow in a sealed container, equal to the one that would carry Nicolas’ lymphocytes. The next step would be to replace the material surgically removed from the earthling, when it was being transported to the room, in a hallway near there, where the princess’ surgery was being performed. He just had to exchange the containers and sabotage the mission. So he arrived in the operating room to sneak in and perform the malicious exchange. Mirov’s plan would be completed and his boss would be pleased. “Nobody gets in here, only doctors.” With a gruff voice, Merko prevented Radof from entering. “What? I’m the nurse that will collect the material to take it to the room where the princess is.” “I can’t allow that anyone enters before checking the information. Our priority is the safety of Princess Isadora and our visitor.” Merko replied. “I have orders not to let anyone enter.” Merko personally sought information about the nurse who would take the material and noted that the young man was the person that the holographic image of the hospital’s computer reported. “The information match, you can enter.” “Please, Tibor, accompany the material until the surgery and don’t take your eyes off him. I’d like that you and Crom also watch the princess’ surgery. It’s our duty to protect the daughter of our king. I’ll be here watching Nicolas.” Radof, after collecting Nicolas’ bone marrow, walked, holding a briefcase in his hand, which had the two containers. His intention was to discharge the material at the first opportunity he could find, however, Tibor and Crom were escorting him attention. Suddenly, Drako contacted Tibor: “One of Mirov’s assistants, Radof, left the council chamber some time ago, went to the operating room and I didn’t see him on palace’s camera nor in the hospital’s. I have a single record of him passing through the corridors of the nursing’s sector. Did you find him?” “There’s no sign of him so far.” “Stay tuned, Tibor, because he’s close. I heard his conversation with Counselor Mirov, planning to do some harm to the princess.” “Leave it with me; I’m personally watching all the details of the transportation of the material for the princess’ surgery.” Radof heard the conversation and, startled, was already preparing himself to shoot Tibor with his laser gun. But until they didn’t discover his transmutation, he could proceed with the plan. Tibor decided to warn Merko, and he said: “I imagine he may have transmuted into any employee of the hospital. Do you have infrared glasses of recognition?” “Yes, Commander Merko. I never get out without my equipment.” “So put them, I will do the same.” Tibor immediately put on his glasses and looked at Radof, whom already had a laser pointed at him and Crom. “Don’t speak any word or you will be disintegrated. Keep walking calmly as if nothing had happened. I want you to leave me at the entrance of the surgery room where the princess is.” “We need to create a plan to neutralize him without damaging the donor’s material.” He communicated telepathically with Crom. “Be calm, we’ll think of some way out.” Before they could think of anything else, Merko materialized behind Radof and hit his neck, taking the laser gun and leaving him passed out. “Get the donated material carefully. I received a strange communication from Counselor Mirov about his assistant saying he would come to the operating room, asking me to protect him. But he was taking too long to appear. In addition, the surgeon who operated Nicolas told me he hadn’t called the nurse yet and asked me if I was the one who had called him. And the material was already going into the other room; I imagined that there would be the crime scene and I now see that I was right.” He removed Radof’s glasses and he assumed his normal appearance. “Thanks, Merko. For a moment I thought it would be my end.” “That’s what friends are for. Crom, take the material to the princess’ room immediately. Tibor, arrest this man. After the end of the surgical procedures, I’ll settle up the score with Counselor Mirov.” *** Mirov was afflicted and walked from one side to the other. “Why is my incompetent servant taking so long? He’s not even informing me the facts.” Mirov decided to contact Merko to try to get some information. “Commander Merko, is everything going well in the earthling’s surgery?” “Yes sir, Counselor Mirov. In a while, I’ll personally explain the details of the operation for you. Wait for me.” “I’ll call the captain of the royal guard, Fizard. He’s also in my team. I promised him the post of commander of planetary troops when I’m the new monarch, and now I need to ask for his support.” Mirov thought. “Captain, something happened to my servant, Radof, because he doesn’t communicate with me.” Mirov told captain Fizard. “I want you to discover and report to me how things are in the hospital. Don’t forget that you will be my commander when I’m the new king.” “If something goes wrong with the original plan, I’ll try to harm the girl’s recovery after surgery. Maybe a poison... I need to find an alternative.” Mirov thought. *** Meanwhile, Zara was worried in one of the waiting rooms of the hospital. She tried to communicate with everyone, but they asked her to wait, because they were committed to preserve the safety of Nicolas and the Princess. Sivoc didn’t want her to be bored because of her pregnancy and wanted her to wait until the end of surgery. “I do not understand why so many secrets. Is something serious happening? But Sivoc knows what he does. I’ll keep waiting for more information. I must remain calm!” She thought, as she tried to keep her emotions under control.",

The anesthesiologist put the mask over the nostrils of the earthling and he fell asleep while the anesthetic liquor was applied in one of the veins in his left arm. Then, he slept deeply and his life was placed in the hands of the best surgeons of the planet Vida. A red light lit on Merko’s sunglasses.

      "content": "– XVIII. Mirov’s Escape – Once again, Drako had recorded the entire conversation with his robot-bird. The evidence against Mirov began to accumulate. “Commander Sivoc, we managed to intercept another communication between Mirov and captain Fizard. They are planning to harm the princess and take the power. I have the recordings here with me.” Drako said. “Thank you, Drako. Great work. I knew that Counselor Mirov had someone else collaborating with his plan. Fizard? I believed he was a good man, but I see he’s ambitious.” Sivoc immediately delivered the recording to Counselor Kenan and they took it to the king Zador II. “How can it be? I know Mirov for so many years and believed in his loyalty. Now I understand that the suggestion to send a second ship for the mission was part of his interest in harming the success of the surgery. He wanted to, somehow, intervene with dark purposes.” “Yes, your majesty. His will to take power and harm the princess was the heart of all the confusion created on planet Earth and orchestrated by the Counselor Mirov.” The king, furious, ordered to arrest Mirov and the captain Fizard, who had prepared an escape if the counselor was arrested. *** A friend of Radof, Croiff, who worked in the royal service, heard the conversation between the king and the Counselor Kenan, so he knew about the order to arrest Counselor Mirov and the captain Fizard. He immediately warned them. Without hesitating, Mirov used one of the secret exits of the palace to try to escape. Beneath the floor of the royal file room, there was a trap door where a staircase led to a tunnel that trespassed the entire palace and the capital, and led to a forest on the north side of the planet. Mirov found the escape route as a kid and used to play hide and seek with the brothers of the king Zador II. There was a picture on the wall with a portrait of the father of King Zador II, King Zador I, and the button that opened the trapdoor was located in his right eye. The place where he arrived was called Mutant Forest, because the plants, trees and animals that lived there suffered mutations that turned them into murderous vegetation. All the results of genetic experiments, which were unsuccessful, were sent there, because it was not allowed to kill living beings on the planet, even if they were consequences of such experiences. Few people managed to escape from this place. “It was very easy to escape. Few people know this escape route.” Mirov thought. “This forest is very dangerous. I have to be careful. But what about the captain Fizard? Where is he? I need get in touch with him to take me to a safer place.” Suddenly, a dark shadow covered him and he looked above, terrified. A teleporting red ray hit him and when he noticed, he was inside a cell in Merko’s ship. “Where did you intend to go, sir?” Asked the commander. “You came to the place where I like to train my soldiers: the Mutant Forest. I know all the palace’s routes of escape and put my men to search for you in all of them as soon as I learned about your escape. Consider yourself a prisoner of the King Zador II. You’ll be judged for betrayal and will certainly rot in prison.” “You, Merko, work for me and has no right to arrest me.” “Mr. Mirov, I must warn you that from now on you lost your job as counselor. Consider yourself arrested by the royal guard. You and your servant, Radof, will be imprisoned in the building of the Penitentiary of Custody and Rehabilitation. I believe you already know it, but just to remind you that the cells are protected with laser beams and it’s impossible to escape. You’ll pay, Mirov, for having conspired against the king Zador II.” *** Captain Fizard, saw movement in the royal palace, and fled as far as possible, helped by some military friends. He intended to stay hidden until things settle down in the kingdom of Zador II. For this, he gathered some men he trusted and decided to create a small army of renegades within the Mutant Forest, in Sector 13. Merko himself had trained them and he knew very well the ways to survive in that jungle. Captain Fizard and his men reached the desired point within the Mutant Forest with his escape ship. Bionic robots, half human and half machine looked above seeing the arrival of the new residents who fled and rushed to attack them. “Captain, I see some points moving in our pursuit in the holographic radar.” He warned the pilot of the ship to escape. “Will it be Merko and his men?” “I don’t believe so, certainly they are still working on the capture of Counselor Mirov. He is the primary target. Analyze the coordinates of the objects that are in motion and show me in the main screen.” Fizard could see five killers’ beings pursuing their ship. He focused them and realized they were monstrous. One of them jumped up and grabbed the ship, destabilizing it. “Prepare the ship’s shield of protection and create a field of sound waves to drive them away.” Ordered the captain to Dargan, a soldier trained by Merko who has joined the fugitive. Once the field of sound waves was turned on, the creature fell off the ship putting its hands over its ears, trying to protect itself from the deafening vibrations. “Lord, can I eliminate them with the laser beams of the ship?” Asked Dargan. “It won’t be necessary. The vibratory sound field is enough. They’ll take long time to recover. Maybe they can be useful in the future.” Deep in the forest, there was a military base built underneath the ground, with three floors, which was abandoned. There, the captain Fizard and seven trained soldiers who had fled with him were settled. They were waiting for an opportunity to return to their families. For now, they needed to wait. What mattered now was survival. *** When Merko returned from his mission, Sivoc came to him and asked: “Merko, did you managed to capture Captain Fizard or have any clue that may lead us to him?” “No, Sivoc. Probably he and his cronies fled to the worst part of the Mutant Forest, where I trained them. We can’t find them, because I was the one who taught them to survive and hide in that barren place. However, we can consider that the fugitives are already stuck where they are. It is not easy to survive there and they’ll go through some bad times. We can go after them when everything is calmer here. Now we need to focus on the main purpose, which is to save the princess.” “Let’s check if everything went well with Nicolas and Isadora.” “No doubt. I have many reasons for wanting them both to be well.” Answered Merko following Sivoc to Nicolas’ room.",

      "content": "– XVIII. Mirov’s Escape – Once again, Drako had recorded the entire conversation with his robot-bird. The evidence against Mirov began to accumulate. “Commander Sivoc, we managed to intercept another communication between Mirov and captain Fizard. They are planning to harm the princess and take the power. I have the recordings here with me.” Drako said. “Thank you, Drako. Great work. I knew that Counselor Mirov had someone else collaborating with his plan. Fizard? I believed he was a good man, but I see he’s ambitious.” Sivoc immediately delivered the recording to Counselor Kenan and they took it to the king Zador II. “How can it be? I know Mirov for so many years and believed in his loyalty. Now I understand that the suggestion to send a second ship for the mission was part of his interest in harming the success of the surgery. He wanted to, somehow, intervene with dark purposes.” “Yes, your majesty. His will to take power and harm the princess was the heart of all the confusion created on planet Earth and orchestrated by the Counselor Mirov.” The king, furious, ordered to arrest Mirov and the captain Fizard, who had prepared an escape if the counselor was arrested. *** A friend of Radof, Croiff, who worked in the royal service, heard the conversation between the king and the Counselor Kenan, so he knew about the order to arrest Counselor Mirov and the captain Fizard. He immediately warned them. Without hesitating, Mirov used one of the secret exits of the palace to try to escape. Beneath the floor of the royal file room, there was a trap door where a staircase led to a tunnel that trespassed the entire palace and the capital, and led to a forest on the north side of the planet. Mirov found the escape route as a kid and used to play hide and seek with the brothers of the king Zador II. There was a picture on the wall with a portrait of the father of King Zador II, King Zador I, and the button that opened the trapdoor was located in his right eye. The place where he arrived was called Mutant Forest, because the plants, trees and animals that lived there suffered mutations that turned them into murderous vegetation. All the results of genetic experiments, which were unsuccessful, were sent there, because it was not allowed to kill living beings on the planet, even if they were consequences of such experiences. Few people managed to escape from this place. “It was very easy to escape. Few people know this escape route.” Mirov thought. “This forest is very dangerous. I have to be careful. But what about the captain Fizard? Where is he? I need get in touch with him to take me to a safer place.” Suddenly, a dark shadow covered him and he looked above, terrified. A teleporting red ray hit him and when he noticed, he was inside a cell in Merko’s ship. “Where did you intend to go, sir?” Asked the commander. “You came to the place where I like to train my soldiers: the Mutant Forest. I know all the palace’s routes of escape and put my men to search for you in all of them as soon as I learned about your escape. Consider yourself a prisoner of the King Zador II. You’ll be judged for betrayal and will certainly rot in prison.” “You, Merko, work for me and has no right to arrest me.” “Mr. Mirov, I must warn you that from now on you lost your job as counselor. Consider yourself arrested by the royal guard. You and your servant, Radof, will be imprisoned in the building of the Penitentiary of Custody and Rehabilitation. I believe you already know it, but just to remind you that the cells are protected with laser beams and it’s impossible to escape. You’ll pay, Mirov, for having conspired against the king Zador II.” *** Captain Fizard, saw movement in the royal palace, and fled as far as possible, helped by some military friends. He intended to stay hidden until things settle down in the kingdom of Zador II. For this, he gathered some men he trusted and decided to create a small army of renegades within the Mutant Forest, in Sector 13. Merko himself had trained them and he knew very well the ways to survive in that jungle. Captain Fizard and his men reached the desired point within the Mutant Forest with his escape ship. Bionic robots, half human and half machine looked above seeing the arrival of the new residents who fled and rushed to attack them. “Captain, I see some points moving in our pursuit in the holographic radar.” He warned the pilot of the ship to escape. “Will it be Merko and his men?” “I don’t believe so, certainly they are still working on the capture of Counselor Mirov. He is the primary target. Analyze the coordinates of the objects that are in motion and show me in the main screen.” Fizard could see five killers’ beings pursuing their ship. He focused them and realized they were monstrous. One of them jumped up and grabbed the ship, destabilizing it. “Prepare the ship’s shield of protection and create a field of sound waves to drive them away.” Ordered the captain to Dargan, a soldier trained by Merko who has joined the fugitive. Once the field of sound waves was turned on, the creature fell off the ship putting its hands over its ears, trying to protect itself from the deafening vibrations. “Lord, can I eliminate them with the laser beams of the ship?” Asked Dargan. “It won’t be necessary.

      "content": "– XIX. The Success of the Surgery – After a few weeks, the Princess Isadora began to regain her health, and the doctors protected her from any contact, until her immune system was fully restored. It seemed that the surgery had been a success and that the princess was safe. Nicolas also recovered from his surgery, and Zara went to visit him in the hospital. When she entered his room, Zara asked the nurses to leave them alone. As she was a doctor, they all agreed. There were still a few guards in the corridor to protect him and fulfill the promise of the King to get him safely to Earth. Mirov and Radof have been arrested, but the captain Fizard was still missing and was considered a threat. Although he was a bit weak, he touched Zara’s face. She approached and kissed him. “How’s the princess?” He asked. “Did we succeed?” “Yes. Thanks to you, she is safe and sound. Thank you, my dear, for coming here to do good for a girl you didn’t know.” “I’m very glad that everything went well. I’d do it for anyone, especially for a sick girl and to attend your request. What about our daughter? Is she okay? And you?” “We’re good. I decided to take you personally to Earth. After arriving there, I’ll find an excuse for us to be together forever. I’ll say goodbye to my relatives here on planet Vida, but I want to come back some day to visit them. Our daughter will be born on your planet. If she is born here, they’ll find out that you are the father and I’ll be punished. Counselor Kenan will help us because he planned everything and knew the risks. My belly still can’t be seen and I gained a little weight to disguise. Did you notice?” She turned aside so Nicolas could look at her. He examined her completely and said: “I love you anyway. You are the most beautiful mother of this planet and of the Earth. I’ll take care of you every day and I’ll be a great dad. I promise!” His life made sense now, and the passion for Zara added to his parental love filled his heart. *** After another week, they were greeted at the Royal Palace with a feast provided by the king and his daughter. Zador II was happy with the recovery of Isadora and could make plans to his reign and his daughter’s again. Merko met Nicolas at the party: “Young earthling, how are you? You recovered very well from surgery, as I see.” “I’m fine, Mr. Commander. The surgery was a success and it wasn’t necessary to kidnap me from Sivoc’s team. Besides, they are far more polite than you.” Nicolas replied, still angry at Merko’s methods. “I’m sorry, young man. I have this military way of being and I will try to improve my attitude. I hope you forgive me.” He replied. “What about the people you killed in your missions? Will you also apologize to their families?” Nicolas asked. “In war, it is “do or die”. I am trained for defense and attack, but I’m retiring. You don’t need to worry about it. But... I need to tell you a secret.” “A secret?” Nicolas was quite curious. “You can talk, sir. I’m listening.” “I met your mother, Lorena, during one of my missions on Earth and we had a relationship during this period. This happened 23 years ago. And...” “What are you trying to say with this? You look nervous.” Nicolas interrupted. “I am your father. Ok, I said!” The two became silent for a moment, and the boy simply didn’t believe. “That’s impossible.” He thought. “Your lymphocytes X are the result of the interbreeding of our genes.” Merko began to explain. “There was a recombination between the future and the past. Your chain of DNA is the same as mine. I discovered it during his surgery, because I know very well my chromosomal strain of defense cells and, when I saw them in the holography, I could be sure that it’s identical to yours.” “I...” The earthling was speechless before such revelation. “This also explains the telekinesis. I saw personally when you used your power in my ship, Nicolas. Let me take you to a place on the planet Vida where I can show you something very interesting.” Merko held Nicolas’ watch with his left hand, and with the right he synchronized the teleport with his own watch. “You press the button of your watch, son. Can I call you like this?” It still sounded a bit strange to Nicolas to hear Merko calling him this way. He didn’t answer the question, but pressed the button curious. Then, father and son reached a distant place from the capital. Nicolas looked around and there was nobody there, only a forest with few trees and plants. Merko climbed next to a mountain. The boy was worried and didn’t know what to expect from that man who seemed to be mysterious; whose reputation and past actions didn’t make him reliable. Then, Merko raised his hands slightly pointing to the sky and pulled the cosmic energy, directing it to the mountain. Nicolas was amazed watching a ray of blue colorcast by his father, who blew up a portion of the top of the mountain with more than one meter of diameter with tremendous force. Witnessing Merko’s power, the boy could feel that all the things said about the commander were true. “Did you understand what the telekinetic energy is and why you own it? We can control the cosmic energy, move objects and control the gravitational fields around them. I’ll teach you to use this strength and dominate it.” Merko said, approaching to Nicolas. “Can I give you a hug, son? As a father...” “No problem, although I feel confused about it. I thought my father was...” Merko and the earthling hugged each other for a few minutes in a deep and touching silence. The father felt a new emotion, a feeling of having done something good in his life, and Nicolas felt protected by a strong father and a figure he had never known. Merko omitted the circumstances of how he met Lorena, because Nicolas would never understand his means to achieve the objectives of the mission. “I’d like to see your mother again. I’ve never felt something so true for a person as I felt for her.” “She lives with my sister. But I don’t think she’ll be interested in you, especially after so many years. And you are an alien!” Nicolas answered. “We’ll see. You know I can turn myself into the earthling I want. About being alien, you know I’m a human from the future and you’re also a hybrid of a human from the past with one from the future, I mean, you are also half alien. But it seems to me that I have a jealous son.” Merko and Nicolas became good friends, and when he knew about Nicolas’ return to the planet Earth with Zara, he decided to help, escorting them. However, what he really wanted was to see Lorena again and remember the best moments with a woman in his life. He also wanted to stay on the planet Earth, conquer the woman of his life and try to be happy with her. *** On the day of Nicolas’ departure, again the king insisted on having a party in tribute to their heroes. Merko and Zara, as a request of Kenan, were chosen to escort the earthling back to Earth. The palace was adorned with the most beautiful flowers of the season, and the guests came from the uttermost parts of the planet Vida. The food was plentiful and tasty, prepared by the great masters of the royal cooking. Princess Isadora was smiling and happy to have her health back and to live like a normal child. She was very grateful to the earthling who had given her what was most precious in her life: health. The king Zador II gifted Nicolas with a ring of communication by high power radio, so he could ask for help if he ever needed. A channel would be opened so they could talk and they’d be able keep their friendship. Nobody imagined that Merko and Zara were planning to stay there and live as ordinary human beings. However, Sivoc, Tibor and Drako suspected that maybe they’d never see them again. It was a good chance for the two extraterrestrial beings to travel and remain on the planet that once had belonged to their ancestors. Sivoc, instead of communicating the fact to the Council, preferred to keep the secret with his team, in which he really trusted. When he returned to Earth, in any other mission, if possible, he certainly would visit them, for old times’ sake. Everyone on the planet treated them as heroes for saving the life of Princess Isadora. After the party, they said goodbye. Sivoc, Drako and Tibor hugged Zara and Nicolas for a long time. The doctor cried and told everyone that she would miss the missions that her team performed on other planets. Nicolas thanked his new friends for the protection on the planet Earth and also on planet Vida, during his surgery. Tibor approached Merko, shook his hand and said: “Take good care of the earthling and Zara. Maybe one day we’ll visit you on your new planet. We are always here if you need some help.” “I’d like to execute some mission by your side, Tibor. Everyone always told me a lot of good things about you, and certainly we would succeed if we work together. But now I’m retiring to take care of my new family. Don’t worry! You have a friend now.” Merko shook hands with Sivoc and Drako. The king and the princess thanked Nicolas again for his help. Kenan took Nicolas’ and Zara’s hands and blessed them, saying: “I trusted you with this mission knowing that the doctor was competent. Take the earthling safely and protect him so he won’t be in danger on his planet. Keep our secret well and Merko will also protect you. Hope to see you soon.” They all accompanied them to the ship Challenge I and, with sad eyes, they finally saw the ship take off, knowing that they would miss them. They traveled with Merko’s ship, entering the space-time gap, and returned to Earth.",

      "content": "– XX. Back to Earth – When they arrived on the planet Earth, Merko entered the deepest part of the sea, by the side of the Pacific Ocean, since members of the Alpha-Omega team were monitoring the Atlantic side. The aliens hid the ship. “Z8, put the ship in a latent state.” Merko ordered the ship’s computer. “Confirm if the robot satellites are in orbit on the planet and put them in the invisible module. Keep the contacts with the planet Vida and contact us if necessary.” “Yes sir, Commander Merko. All actions had been executed.” Said a computer’s female voice. They teleported to Los Angeles and materialized in the Chinatown’s subway. Merko put his glasses and chose to become a man about 48 years old, dark brown eyes, broad shoulders, strong physique, 6’1”, the male type that Lorena dreamed of finding. Zara returned to be the beautiful woman who charmed Nicolas on their first meeting and the earthling returned to his normal form. Together they entered the train as normal humans, but even Nicolas, who now knew he was a hybrid, between human beings from the past and from the future, already felt like an “alien”. “Nicolas, would you mind if I came to see your mother?” Asked Merko. “Obviously not. If I want to marry an alien, why couldn’t my mother do the same? Especially now that I am also an alien.” He answered. “Since my own son is giving me his permission, I’ll date your mother again.” “Will she accept? You are very self-confident.” “I will do everything possible.” *** Merko and Zara went to a hotel in Los Angeles. Until they found a definitive place to live they would be staying at that hotel, not far from Nicolas’ house. Everything was new to them; the people, the home, the new planet and they needed some time to adapt themselves. When they returned to planet Earth, they timed their return to the approximate point of Nicolas’ disappearance, as they had agreed. This would improve the chances of a return to normalcy in his life. So Nicolas came back shortly after his disappearance and many problems that occurred after his departure, like Lorena and his sister’s concern would be abbreviated with his arrival, preventing his mother to warn the police and receiving the message. Besides, it would also be good to make the biggest traces of extraterrestrial presence on Earth disappear, like what happened in Central Park and at the gym, so that the attention of the Alpha-Omega team wouldn’t be so close. Nicolas said goodbye to them and went home, he needed to meet his family again. He missed his mother and his sister very much and seeing them was what he wanted. He knew that the two of them should be worried about him and he just wanted to show them that there was no reason for concern. He put his hands in his pocket and didn’t find his keys. He had probably lost them. So, he went toward the house and knocked on the door. Lorena promptly opened it and froze when she saw her son, who she feared she had lost. She began to weep and embraced him. “My dear son, where have you been during this time? It doesn’t matter! I just want to hug you, feel you.” Tears ran down through Lorena’s cheeks, which showed a big relief to finally have her son back. “Mother, I’m sorry for not giving news in the recent days. Don’t cry, it wasn’t that long.” “My son, for a mother every second is precious. And you have always been very responsible; you had never done anything like this before. I was very concerned about the lack of news and feared the worst.” “Calm down, now I’m back, safe and sound.” “Why did you disappear, my son? Why did you leave me so worried? “I met a woman and had to travel to help her solve a problem. Forgive me for not warning you. There was a sick person in her family, and we had to find an effective treatment as soon as possible to save her. It was a seven year-old girl named Isadora.” “A seven years old girl? How is she? Is she better?” Asked Lorena showing concern. “Don’t worry, mom. The girl is healed and all the effort we made to help her had a great result. She is well and happy. We were very pleased to be able to save her.” Lorena smiled with satisfaction, realizing that the education she had given to her son turned him into a good man. She couldn’t hold back the flood of tears and cried desperately, giving a tight hug in her firstborn. At first, the boy was frightened by his mother’s attitude, but soon understood and hugged her, filling her with kisses and caressing her for the first time since he had left her without news and worried. At this moment, Sophia, who had just heard her brother’s voice, came running to meet him. She jumped on his neck, embraced and kissed him, saying: “My brother, you’re back. I love you! I missed you so much!” “I love you.” Nicolas replied and was so thrilled that his voice was choked. He embraced his sister and mother in a triple hug. He also missed that he spent many months away from those whom he loved so much. Even if they missed him only for some days, for him it had been months. He needed that comforting hug. “Next time, my son, that you need to travel and solve some problems, please let us knows so that we won’t be suffering without news. We are a family. We can’t stay apart. And it doesn’t cost anything, isn’t it?” “I’m sorry, mom. And I promise I won’t do that anymore. However, I have good news.” “I bet it’s related to that woman you mentioned, isn’t it?” “Does Nicolas have a girlfriend?” Asked a curious Sophia. “The two are right. I have a girlfriend and I am very happy with Zara. Soon I’ll introduce her for you two. The three women in my life need to meet and I’m sure you’ll be good friends.” Mother and daughter were curious to know the woman who conquered Nicolas’ heart. They knew he was a good man, but he had no luck with women and they hoped that this time he had found a good partner. He certainly deserved it. That was a wonderful evening with the family together again. There were endless conversations over dinner, prepared by Lorena especially for her son; with the food he liked the most. They talked about everything, but the subject always came back to Zara. They were all anxious for that meeting. *** Nicolas wanted to take Zara to meet his mother and Sophia one week after his return. The boy asked his mother to prepare a dinner, so he would invite his girlfriend to meet the family. Lorena was a great cook and prepared a delicious duck with orange and roasted potatoes washed down by Port wine. Sophia and her mother waited anxious to know the one that had conquered Nicolas’ heart. The doorbell rang and Sophia ran to the door to answer it. “It must be her.” Said the reckless girl. “Take it easy, darling. Let Nick welcome her. After all, she’s his girlfriend.” Lorena challenged. “Okay, Mom. Let me open it.” Said the boy already heading to the door. Nicolas received Zara, which looked lovely. She wore jeans and a red shirt, which despite being simple was elegant. He kissed her mouth lightly and hugged her. Then he took her hand and, realizing that she was nervous about meeting her new family, he led her gently towards his mother. “Zara, this is my mother.” “Nice to meet you, Zara. I’m glad to know you. I see you’ve been making my son very happy.” The beauty of her daughter in law enchanted Lorena. “The pleasure is all mine. In fact, is your son who makes me happy.” “This is Sophia, my sister. Isn’t she beautiful?” “I think she’s much prettier than you said, Nick.” Sophia blushed and hugged Zara. She smiled at her, somewhat embarrassed. She was very happy to meet her sister in law. “My brother has good taste and knew how to choose a beautiful girlfriend.” “Your family is very friendly, Nick. I hope they like me.” “I love you, Zara. And I want you to be part of my family. Do you all agree?” “It’ll be a pleasure.” Lorena replied. Sophia just moved her head as a sign of approval. The dinner was magnificent! The three women get along very well and Zara already seemed to be part of the family. She praised Lorena’s food and took some time to talk to Sophia, who showed her room and some of her projects in school. At the end of the night, Nicolas and Zara went to his room to talk a bit and make plans for their new life. *** One day, when Lorena was on the way to her work as a hairdresser, Merko allowed himself to bump into her, knocking the purse of the beautiful woman down. He calmly picked it up and said: “Please, excuse me. I was nervous when I saw you, because I think you have a beauty from another planet.” She smiled at his words and they began a long conversation. Merko suggested they met at night to get to know each other, and Lorraine promptly accepted. She was glad to see her son, Nicolas, and meet her daughter in law. Now, what still missed, to complete her life, was a man who loved and protected her. It was quite providential to find such a classy and gentle man on the way to work. Of course she would accept to go out with him and hoped it was a wonderful evening. At night, Merko picked Lorena at her home. She had given her address after the long conversation they had on their cell phones during the afternoon. She looked stunning in a black dress with a neckline. She was even more beautiful than Merko remembered. For their first date, Merko searched enough on the Internet and even got tips from Nicolas and Zara. Everything had to be perfect and he chose a very elegant restaurant to take that one he already knew to be the woman of his life. “Is your name Merko? It’s a different name! What about your last name? You haven’t told me what it is.” Lorena said while they waited for the order they had made to the waiter, tasting a delicious wine. “It’s Merko Silion.” Suddenly he answered deciding to use the friend’s name to honor him. ‘Lorena, you look beautiful tonight! I’m glad you agreed to go out with me.” Merko changed the subject, because he couldn’t reveal too much of his personal life. The two of them took the opportunity to enjoy the great food while they chatted about amenities. They talked about their musical tastes, movies and even a little bit of their personal lives. Merko used all his charm to conquer the beautiful women. The conversation was so good, that after finishing the meal they didn’t want to leave. They headed to a square near the restaurant where they could spend a little more time together. Both enjoyed each other’s company a lot and didn’t want to say goodbye. Sitting on a bench at that square, they watched people passing by, the beautiful flowers of the season in the top of the trees and exchanged significant glances. Merko touched her right hand. Since she didn’t move, he held her gently. He looked at Lorena and, not resisting her full lips, he promptly kissed her, feeling sensations that his life would become very special from that moment. The couple completed each other and enjoyed that unique moment of extreme happiness. Merko kept many secrets in his mind that, if revealed, they would obviously destroy those magical moments. But it wasn’t the time to think about how he would reveal his life to Lorena. It was necessary to enjoy the chemistry that existed between them. *** At the Pentagon, the chief Ronald Steighen and the agents Netil and Soliver were gathered to review all the evidence they had collected from the alien presence on the planet. They didn’t find a concrete conclusion; however, they made a report with all the information gathered during the investigation. They would keep their eyes open, waiting for some opportunity to capture, with the help of security forces, aliens from other planets, their ships and weapons. *** Dither, the editor, asked his journalist, Thomas, to discover why the government was protecting so much the information about the presence of aliens on Earth. An informant from the Air Force told the editor about the episode of the invasion of the Earth’s airspace by UFOs. He learned that two alien’s spaceships were detected by the radars of the Multinational Space Station and then disappeared without explanation. Probably, there were aliens on our planet. The journalist waited for more evidence of the extraterrestrial presence here on Earth in order to give the news that would shake the way that humans saw the world. *** Zara, Nicolas and Merko vowed to keep their identities in secret and managed to live like normal people. Merko opened a company of security values and personal protection. He worked during the day and at night went to Lorena’s house to date her. She thought about him as protective man and imagined he had appeared in her life to complete all her dreams as a woman. He was actually the other half that would complete her, the one that would protect her for the rest of her life. A man transformed by the power of love. *** After all the adventures he lived, it was time for Nicolas to go back to his studies in physics. When he returned to college, he met Sanchez. “Where have you been, Nicolas?” Sanchez asked when he saw his friend. “We missed you. You have a lot to catch up on. During this time you were absent, a lot of things was thought to us, the students. Coincidentally, Zara didn’t show up at college. What a strange thing!” “If I told you everything I’ve been through during this period, you wouldn’t believe.” Replied the boy with a mysterious air. “But let’s say I made an important trip to meet new people from other places.” “I didn’t understand what you mean by that.” Sanchez said confusing. “Okay. Maybe someday I’ll explain it to you better.” While they talked in the middle of the courtyard of the college, few students from the same course, including George and Adam, came closer to him. “Nicolas, you are here? You disappeared. What happened? Did you have any psychic outbreak?” Adam asked with a sarcastic tone. “Let’s say I took a time to relax my mind.” He answered without getting embarrassed with the mean comment. That was when the beautiful Zara came walking toward them with her heavenly blue eyes and a beautiful silhouette, which the pregnancy hasn’t been able to modify yet. Everyone on the campus stared at her as she walked toward Nicolas. She kissed him on the lips and said: “Nick, my dear... Do you want to introduce me to your friends? I study in this college, but it seems that you’re the only one I know.” “Of course, my love.” He said, proudly. “This is Zara.” He turned to those who had mocked him minutes before, to introduce his girlfriend. He had a smile, and the happiness was stamped in his face. “She is a new student who came transferred from another university from the East Coast. Do you remember her? She entered our university little time ago to study physics there. We’re together.” Everyone was perplexed and amazed by the lucky of the boy they teased so much in college for being weird and unable to captivate any girl. “What did you see in him, Zara?” George wanted to know. “Let’s say I can read his mind, so I know things about him that no one else is able to know.” Zara replied with half a smile. “Come on, Nick, we need to have dinner together tonight. You promised me a romantic dinner, remember?” And they were all amazed watching the two lovers leaving embraced. Sanchez looked at the couple and thought: Now I understand why Nicolas disappeared during this time with the new student. They know how to enjoy life! *** At night, Nicolas and Zara got out for the highly anticipated romantic dinner and chose an Italian restaurant where she really enjoyed the food. Her pregnancy made her insatiably hungry, although it was still very early. “Zara, what name will we choose for our daughter?” The boy took the opportunity to talk about the baby. “I’d like we called her Helen. It is a strong name. What do you think?” “I like this name. It’s certainly beautiful like her mother. We’ll do everything to make her a happy girl.” She smiled feeling the happiness in the glance of her love, and read in his mind the desire to take care of the daughter who was in her womb. “My love, we need to tell your mother about my pregnancy. We can’t wait too long or she will discover by herself and may be disappointed because we didn’t reveal the truth.” “We’ll tell her next weekend. We’ve already scheduled that picnic and I think it will be the ideal moment to tell about our little Helen. I’m sure that both my mother and my sister will be happy to hear the news.” “It will really be a perfect time!” The rest of the night was really enjoyed by the couple, who now lived romantic moments, with a lot of passion, involved in total harmony. *** Zara changed to medical school after making some tests and proving to be capable. She soon stood out as a student, with great grades, but she couldn’t go beyond what would seem ordinary to the eyes of other students or teachers. Her desire was to specialize in Genetics to be able to return to practice her profession according to the law on the planet Earth. Those feelings of anxiety that she once felt were now so rare, that she didn’t mentioned them anymore. Maybe it was the fruit of the passion she felt for Nicolas and also the joy of being a mother. The boy noticed that Zara was better from those symptoms of anxiety and avoided talking about it. Soon she would have to take a leave from college because of pregnancy. The doctor’s belly was slowly growing but her pregnancy was healthy. Nicolas noticed that she was eating well when they went out for dinner or for a snack, but he tried to make her feel comfortable. *** Merko and Lorena went out a lot and everything was quite new to him, because the habits of fun and the rides were quite different from what he was accustomed to do on the planet Vida. When he saw police cars passing by and heard telepathically the communications about crimes, he felt an almost irresistible urge to chase criminals. Then, he calmed himself down and thought he shouldn’t get involved in the problems. He turned to the woman he loved and they had fun, as a happy couple. *** On the planet Vida, everything seemed to be normal after the arrest of the villain Mirov. However, even arrested he stayed walking from one side to the other in his cell, thinking of a way to escape. His servant, Radof, was nervous in the next cell and, one day, he asked: “Master, why are you so anxious?” “Shut up, Radof. I need to think of a way to get out of here. Where is Captain Fizard? He cowardly hid himself; when, in fact, he’s our only chance to escape.” “I don’t understand what you’re saying, master. You can’t escape.” “Be quiet. Let me think.” Mirov continued his eternal walk in the space where he was imprisoned, articulating a Machiavellian plan to escape from there and, with it, be able get revenge from his enemies. *** Meanwhile, on Earth, Nicolas and Zara were already thinking about the possibility of living together, because it would be the natural consequence of their relationship, especially now, with the arrival of the girl who would change their lives.",

      "content": "– XX. Back to Earth – When they arrived on the planet Earth, Merko entered the deepest part of the sea, by the side of the Pacific Ocean, since members of the Alpha-Omega team were monitoring the Atlantic side. The aliens hid the ship. “Z8, put the ship in a latent state.” Merko ordered the ship’s computer. “Confirm if the robot satellites are in orbit on the planet and put them in the invisible module. Keep the contacts with the planet Vida and contact us if necessary.” “Yes sir, Commander Merko. All actions had been executed.” Said a computer’s female voice. They teleported to Los Angeles and materialized in the Chinatown’s subway. Merko put his glasses and chose to become a man about 48 years old, dark brown eyes, broad shoulders, strong physique, 6’1”, the male type that Lorena dreamed of finding. Zara returned to be the beautiful woman who charmed Nicolas on their first meeting and the earthling returned to his normal form. Together they entered the train as normal humans, but even Nicolas, who now knew he was a hybrid, between human beings from the past and from the future, already felt like an “alien”. “Nicolas, would you mind if I came to see your mother?” Asked Merko. “Obviously not. If I want to marry an alien, why couldn’t my mother do the same? Especially now that I am also an alien.” He answered. “Since my own son is giving me his permission, I’ll date your mother again.” “Will she accept? You are very self-confident.” “I will do everything possible.” *** Merko and Zara went to a hotel in Los Angeles. Until they found a definitive place to live they would be staying at that hotel, not far from Nicolas’ house. Everything was new to them; the people, the home, the new planet and they needed some time to adapt themselves. When they returned to planet Earth, they timed their return to the approximate point of Nicolas’ disappearance, as they had agreed. This would improve the chances of a return to normalcy in his life. So Nicolas came back shortly after his disappearance and many problems that occurred after his departure, like Lorena and his sister’s concern would be abbreviated with his arrival, preventing his mother to warn the police and receiving the message. Besides, it would also be good to make the biggest traces of extraterrestrial presence on Earth disappear, like what happened in Central Park and at the gym, so that the attention of the Alpha-Omega team wouldn’t be so close. Nicolas said goodbye to them and went home, he needed to meet his family again. He missed his mother and his sister very much and seeing them was what he wanted.

The boy noticed that Zara was better from those symptoms of anxiety and avoided talking about it. Soon she would have to take a leave from college because of pregnancy. The doctor’s belly was slowly growing but her pregnancy was healthy. Nicolas noticed that she was eating well when they went out for dinner or for a snack, but he tried to make her feel comfortable. *** Merko and Lorena went out a lot and everything was quite new to him, because the habits of fun and the rides were quite different from what he was accustomed to do on the planet Vida. When he saw police cars passing by and heard telepathically the communications about crimes, he felt an almost irresistible urge to chase criminals. Then, he calmed himself down and thought he shouldn’t get involved in the problems. He turned to the woman he loved and they had fun, as a happy couple. *** On the planet Vida, everything seemed to be normal after the arrest of the villain Mirov. However, even arrested he stayed walking from one side to the other in his cell, thinking of a way to escape. His servant, Radof, was nervous in the next cell and, one day, he asked: “Master, why are you so anxious?” “Shut up, Radof. I need to think of a way to get out of here. Where is Captain Fizard? He cowardly hid himself; when, in fact, he’s our only chance to escape.” “I don’t understand what you’re saying, master. You can’t escape.” “Be quiet. Let me think.” Mirov continued his eternal walk in the space where he was imprisoned, articulating a Machiavellian plan to escape from there and, with it, be able get revenge from his enemies. *** Meanwhile, on Earth, Nicolas and Zara were already thinking about the possibility of living together, because it would be the natural consequence of their relationship, especially now, with the arrival of the girl who would change their lives.",

      "content": "– XXI. The Wedding – Earth – Year 2017 After so many adventures, Nicolas and Zara only wanted to live a normal life, enjoy their romance and the daughter who would soon be born. They were living in a house on the outskirts of Los Angeles, not far from Lorena, because they wanted to keep living near her. Nicolas went back to study Physics was a bright student, very interested in cosmology and the curvature of space-time, which would allow time travel in the future. Zara continued to study medicine until her due date. Lorena insisted that the two lovers should marry in a church, but her son didn’t care for it and neither did Zara. Marriage on her old planet was very simple. Merko didn’t want to interfere because he didn’t even know what was like a weeding in a church. But since Nicolas’ mother kept asking them both for a traditional ceremony and they were already living together they decided to do it. *** The boy went to a jewelry store and bought a pair of gold wedding rings. Since he would marry Zara in a few weeks, according to his mother’s desire, he would like to give his fiancée a perfect gem. For the occasion more than special he invited his beloved for a dinner with candles at a restaurant on Melrose Avenue. The place was specialized for couple’s celebrations, especially at night, because there was a dim light over the tables, which provided a romantic atmosphere. A large chandelier of crystals was positioned in the middle of the hall and a vase with red flowers was neatly placed on each table. Two violinists played soft songs. Nicolas wore black pants, white shirt and a dark brown blazer. His shoes were black and polished. Zara wore an indigo blue dress reaching her knees with a white shoe. “Zara, do you want to marry a simple Earthman?” Nicolas asked after kneeling in front of her with a small velvet box in his hands. “Of course I do.” She was visibly touched. “I want to marry the most handsome man on this planet.” He put a beautiful engagement ring on her finger and she did the same. Nicolas touched her face and pulled her down for a tender kiss. Tears began to fall down her face. Tears of joy, representing her happiness to live and experience the great love she felt for Nicolas. *** They choose a temple in Salt Lake for the wedding ceremony. The place was one of the most beautiful chapels in the city with several coconut trees adorning the side road to the church. This one had been recently renovated and was painted yellow outside contrasting with the columns painted in white. The inner walls had light beige coating, alternating with other colors in a slightly darker beige color. Statues of saints over pedestals were standing behind the pulpits. White flowers behind the altar provided an air of peace with the help of the angels. Lorena was in charge of the preparations and went to the best shops in Los Angeles to choose the dress with Zara. They spent hours on the search. Finally, the doctor decided for a white dress with pearls around her collar and crystals that were shining softly on the light. Lorena and Sophia didn’t seem able to talk about other thing and Zara was also so happy, surrounded by the atmosphere. The women prepared the clothes, the party and enjoyed the good fortune that a wedding brings. The long-awaited day finally arrived. The guests were anxious to enter the church and everyone wanted to see the arrival of the bride. Sanchez was among the guests, along with college students, teachers and all of the family’s friends. Almost all the men were dressed in suits and the women wore long dresses, each one more beautiful than the other. White and yellow flowers were placed around the main hall, and Nicolas could see that some of flowers were jasmine. Seven young people were behind the altar of the church with their violins, cellos and piano. The godparents positioned themselves side by side in the first three rows of the church where they were standing awaiting the arrival of the bride. The maestro sang the song “Ave Maria” by Johann Sebastian Bach and Charles Gounod, which was wonderful in the ears of all people that attended the ceremony. The groom felt the scent of jasmine and waited for his lover beside his mother. The bridesmaid and groomsmen started to walk and everyone was just paying attention to them. The music stopped for a few seconds and an absolute silence filled the room. It was the anticipation of the arrival of the bride. Nicolas was anxious and stared at the doorway of the church waiting for Zara. Lorena was at his side with a light pink dress with a strap on the left shoulder and white shoes. Seeing that tears were flowing from her eyes, Nicolas took a handkerchief from his jacket pocket and gave her. Sophia entered when the music began to play, sung by a chorus of voices of the singers who were standing on a mezzanine. She wore a white dress and a small wreath, and threw petals of red flowers on the way through which the bride would pass. The musicians started to play the wedding march by Mendelssohn. Merko entered the temple arm in arm with Zara, who wore her beautiful white dress with veil and bouquet of flowers on her hand. She smiled happily at Nicolas. Merko wore a black suit with a light blue shirt and gray tie with black stripes. He would prefer to use military clothing, but the suit made him feel important in the middle of all these people. Zara looked and smiled to everyone on the left and the right side of the hall and realized that at that time she was the center of attention. She was grinning happily and showing them her joy and fulfillment. As she walked, she thanked everyone’s presence with a nod, beaming and saying: “Thank you.” Her eyes showed all the emotion she was feeling when walking towards the altar. Nicolas was holding Lorena arm on the left side of the altar. Lorena’s smile was incessant and she let her son go when Zara arrived. He hugged Merko, that after kissing the bride on her cheek he went to stand by Lorena on the right side of the altar. The groom finally and tenderly kissed Zara’s forehead. Lorena was thrilled, almost crying with the whole scene. Merko was nervous not knowing what to do and was just staying close to Lorena. He gave her his arm and she leaned on him, proud to be with her husband at that moment. Sophia was standing in the front row and felt that from that moment on she had gained a sister, whom she considered beautiful and she knew she was going to be a good friend and a counselor. The girl was very happy to be part of the first wedding in the family, which looked just like a fairy tale. Bride and groom were positioned on the altar and stared at each other lovingly, like there was no one around them. The priest asked everyone to join him in a prayer and bless the couple when they were confessing their love for each other. The altar boy held the Bible while the priest proceeded with ceremony. He told Nicolas to repeat after him and he was so nervous and anxious that he had problems to follow the simple instructions. Zara also repeated the words of love and loyalty that brought hope and joy to her heart. The ceremony was very beautiful and everyone was so happy for the young couple. Everywhere in the church you could see someone wiping some tears. Unmarried women waited anxious for the moment when the bride would throw the bouquet, which, according to tradition, would give luck to the one who got it. It was the time for the rings, and another bridesmaid entered the hall carrying it on a small white satin pillow embroidered with lace. Step by step, everyone watched the little girl who was now the center of attention. Upon reaching the altar, she gently handed to the couple the symbol of their union. After hearing the words of the priest, the couple exchanged the rings and shared a passionate kiss. Now they were married according to the laws of men from the planet Earth. When they left the church, Zara turned her back, and the women anxiously waited for the bouquet. She counted until to three and threw it. A college friend from the university got the flowers and smiled with the luck that the tradition promised her. A limousine was waiting for the couple while the guests threw rice grains on the bride and groom, which represent abundance. Everything had been planned by Lorena to provide an air of beauty and perfect joy. *** After the wedding, there was a party at a club in the region. It was a wonderful place with a lake surrounded by green grass, full of white swans. A white bridge passed over the lake and made the place even more magical. At night the light of the garden were accentuated by the beauty of the arrangements placed throughout the ballroom. Plenty of food and drinks were served to the while everyone was dancing to the music that was being played electronically. Then, the stage was opened and a band playing live songs surprised the guests. Everyone was shocked with the good news. The young couple had the privilege to dance the first song on the dance floor and soon many joined them dancing and celebrating their union. Sanchez walked toward Nicolas and Zara to greet them: “Congratulations, Nicolas, for this time of happiness. I could never imagine you would date a beautiful student who arrived at our college. Congratulations for you too, Zara. I wish a lot of happiness to the couple! And I ask you to take good care of my friend. He’s a special guy!” “Thanks, Sanchez. I’ll wait for your visit and I’d like you to come to my new home. One of these days, I’ll be at your wedding...” Nicolas replied smiling. “Thank you, Sanchez. Friends of my husband are my friends too.” Lorena asked the music to stop for a moment and got the microphone from the stage saying: “Let’s make a toast for the bride and the groom and their happiness!” Everyone raised their glasses of champagne and shouted aloud: “Congratulations to the new family!” Zara and Nicolas stared at each other, happy, and kissed for a few seconds in the middle of the hall. Then the audience clapped and everyone smiled happily. The party was wonderful, and everything worked according to Lorena’s plan. Now she was very happy because her son was married to a good girl. But she was wondering: Why the bride’s family did not attend the ceremony, not even one person? Merko read her mind and approaching said: “Honey, you look worried. What happened? The party is beautiful, your son is happy, there is no reason to be concerned today.” “Oh, my love, I can’t stop thinking about the reasons that prevented the girl’s family to attend the wedding.” “Lorena, we’ve already talked about this. She only has her parents. They came to America when they were both very young and lost contact with the rest of the family. They are very old and couldn’t make it to the wedding. One day we’ll go visit them and you will understand what I mean.” Merko said, hugging and kissing her. Thought if she knew Zara’s parents, she would faint with the surprise. He thought smiled. “Why are you laughing, Merko?” “It’s nothing, my love. I’m just happy for this moment and was thinking about your silly concern.” He replied, kissing her tenderly on the lips. Grabbing her by the arms, he led her to the dance floor, adding: “Come on, let’s celebrate this special day!” Merko and Lorena were on the dance floor when he affectionately touched her face with his, and whispered in her ear: “I want to enjoy this wonderful moment and ask you to marry me. Will you agree to be my wife?” He said looking directly into her eyes. “Of course I agree my love. I want to live with you forever!” Merko and Lorena decided to get married in a simple ceremony at the registry office of the city, and that he now moved to her house.",

      "content": "– XXII. Helen’s birth – After a few months passed Zara belly began to grow, and she was now eight months pregnant. The preparations for the birth of the child were being made, and everyone was anxious for Helen’s arrival. During one beautiful night Nicolas spoke with Zara on the balcony about the arrival of their baby. “Zara, do you think our daughter will be born in the human form or will she have the evolved appearance like the people from your planet?” “I have done prenatal work at our ship, while you and Merko just talked about the stars and the cosmos. I see that you always get lost on the subjects when you two are talking, and even more when he is teaching you how to fly. That’s why I have kept the details out and just said that everything is okay with our daughter. And it is true, you don’t need to worry, Helen is fine. But it’s important that we discuss the future of our daughter. Z8 showed me that the gene predominant is in his earthly form. I prefer to be in our laboratory inside the ship because I think it’s safer to her and to avoid any problem. The doctor’s in Earth would never understand if they saw a baby with alien features. I had some doubts about the genetic dominance of our races. She is hybrid like you are and she’ll also be born in the same way you did, she will be the daughter of a hybrid human and an evolved human from the future. This will facilitate her life here on earth, because she won’t have to wear transmutation glasses. She’ll need them only if she decides to become an evolved human, or maybe, someday, if we travel to planet Vida. After knowing that our daughter will have human features like everybody else here in earth, I can find a doctor to do the last prenatal tests, and help me with the final weeks of pregnancy.” “Let us choose an obstetrician as soon as possible here in Los Angeles. Your teachers should know a good medical professional to indicate us. I’m glad you made the preliminary tests in the ship.” “I’ll take a license from college stop my classes for a few months. Despite being a doctor on my planet, I need to study medicine according to the rules of this country in order to work here and get a degree in Genetics one day.” “I’m sure we will be very happy!” Nicolas said, rubbing her huge belly and kissing her on the lips.” “It looks like someone heard what you said.” Zara commented feeling Helen kicking. “This name I chose means torch or light and is derived from Greek mythology. Helen was the daughter of Zeus and Leda – a demigod. I think it is a name with a beautiful pronunciation and its history is even more beautiful!” “Have you been studying ancient history?” “I always wanted to choose the name of our daughter, so I looked for one that could express the light this girl will bring into our lives.” “I like this name and everything else that comes from you.” Nicolas kissed her belly to show his affection for his daughter. He smiled with happiness. He felt he was living moments of glory by winning a beautiful wife and a daughter, a gift that would be born from their love. *** The date of the birth approached, and Zara already felt that at any moment her bag would burst. She began to feel the pressure increasing day by day and in the last prenatal exam she was told by her doctor to take antihypertensive drugs to prevent the risk of eclampsia. The increased blood pressure could reduce the amniotic fluid, called oligohydramnios, and it also could cause fetal distress putting the baby’s life in danger. Zara knew all of this, and she and Nicolas decided that due to the proximity of the birth it would be better to be in the hospital until the time the baby was born. Lorena was in the hospital with Zara while she was preparing herself for Helen’s arrival. Nicolas also took a leave from college to be able to follow the delivery. Several 3D ultrasounds were performed to verify the position of the fetus and the girl’s heart rate was monitored to see if she responded well to medication. After a few days at the hospital it was finally time for the delivery. The future father was nervous because it was his first time. Zara was also anxious, and the personal experience of being a mother was something new and challenging for her, despite being a doctor and having seen and tracked multiple births on her planet. The obstetrician preferred to make a cesarean section due to the risks, and the couple readily agreed. The recovery would take a little longer because of the sutures, but the reduction of the risks would be worth it. Merko and Sophia were visiting them in the hospital, and Lorena remained next to the Zara. The doctor examined the pregnant woman along with the nursing staff and she was transferred to the operating room. Pre-anesthetic was done, and only after the anesthesia the father could enter the room to closely monitor the medical procedures. Nicolas put the clothes to enter the operating room and took his camera to film all the magical moments and all the details. The labor began, and Zara was half asleep under the effects of sedatives, when a cry of newborn echoed in the operating room. Helen was born. The father looked at his daughter, still bloody and bathed by the fluids from her mother’s womb, and smiled with joy. He couldn’t contain the feeling that took hold of his soul. My God, it’s not possible. Thank you for this moment. My daughter was born! Nicolas said in a prayer just in his mind. The pediatrician saw the child providing her the first care and then the nurse wrapped the baby; put her in the lap of the father who was awkwardly trying to find a best position to hold her. The mother remained in the obstetric center, waiting for the end of the C-section. Outside, the relatives were asking questions to the doctors every time someone came out of the surgery area, and they telling the good news: “A beautiful girl was born; the baby and her mother are well.” “I hope the father is well too because he was so nervous that he probably needed medical attention.” Merko said smiling. “Stop with it, honey. My son is fine and certainly is in heaven with the birth of his first daughter.” Helen received a pink bracelet, just like Zara, with the same identification code of the mother, and was taken to a recovery room and inside an incubator for 30 minutes to return to ideal body temperature. The curtain opened and the family was able to meet the baby. Soon after, the nursing staff took the first anthropometric measurements and gave the first vaccines to protect the child. Meanwhile, Zara was taken to a recovery room and remained there for an hour, after they took the baby to stay with her and start encouraging her to the first breastfeeding. The mother, seeing that her daughter had already taken her bath and smelled like a baby, was mesmerized by joy and could only smile. She was still half asleep because of the effect of the anesthesia. Then, they were taken to the room where they could receive visitors. Lorena had separate kits with clothes for the baby like diapers and socks. So, after each bath they just had to pick up and use a kit that was already prepared. She had chosen, together with Zara, girl clothes and each one was more beautiful than the other. They also had won many gifts from friends who visited them, and, mostly, they were baby clothes. “People really like to give child’s clothes as gifts. I love it!” Zara thought whenever she won them. Nicolas stayed all the time beside his wife, who was feeding the baby. He took her little one in his lap, feeling how good it was to be a father and promising to protect and care for his daughter. “What a beautiful baby!” Lorena said, seeing her granddaughter for the first time. “I brought a hot pink blanket for this adorable baby who was just born. Can I hold her a little bit?” “It is obvious that you can take her, my mother in law.” Lorena took the girl in her arms and smelled that delicious scent of baby. “What a delight to be able to hold a child in my arms again. Especially after knowing that is my granddaughter!” After some time with Helen in her arms, she asked Merko: “Honey, hold her for a moment too. Feel how good it is to have a baby in your arms.” Merko looked nervous at the child, and with shake hands got her. Lorena said: “Put her on the left arm and support her with you right hand underneath.” The girl was sleeping peacefully showing how comfortable she was on in his arms. “What a cute little thing!” Merko said. “Merko, you’re good with kids.” Nicolas said smiling. Merko smiled back enjoying that single moment which he may never have lived if he didn’t make the decision to travel back with Nicolas and Zara to the planet Earth. Then Sophia took her in her arms and was delighted since it was the first time she held up a baby. Zara looked at her with tenderness apparently she did could spend hours and hours just holding Helen. “Bath time.” Said the nurse upon entering the room. “I’ll take care of Helen and I want everyone to wait outside for a while, please.” Everyone left, while the nurse took care of the baby and put a bandage on her navel. Then she left Helen with Zara, who began to feed the baby with the precious colostrum that came with the first drops of her breast milk. After a few minutes, the family who had been having a snack in the cafeteria outside the hospital returned. “She has blue eyes like her mother.” Nicolas announced. Seeing his granddaughter, Merko understood he had made the right decision to return to planet Earth, and Zara was also happy with her love.",

      "content": "– XXII. Helen’s birth – After a few months passed Zara belly began to grow, and she was now eight months pregnant. The preparations for the birth of the child were being made, and everyone was anxious for Helen’s arrival. During one beautiful night Nicolas spoke with Zara on the balcony about the arrival of their baby. “Zara, do you think our daughter will be born in the human form or will she have the evolved appearance like the people from your planet?” “I have done prenatal work at our ship, while you and Merko just talked about the stars and the cosmos. I see that you always get lost on the subjects when you two are talking, and even more when he is teaching you how to fly. That’s why I have kept the details out and just said that everything is okay with our daughter. And it is true, you don’t need to worry, Helen is fine. But it’s important that we discuss the future of our daughter. Z8 showed me that the gene predominant is in his earthly form. I prefer to be in our laboratory inside the ship because I think it’s safer to her and to avoid any problem. The doctor’s in Earth would never understand if they saw a baby with alien features. I had some doubts about the genetic dominance of our races. She is hybrid like you are and she’ll also be born in the same way you did, she will be the daughter of a hybrid human and an evolved human from the future. This will facilitate her life here on earth, because she won’t have to wear transmutation glasses. She’ll need them only if she decides to become an evolved human, or maybe, someday, if we travel to planet Vida. After knowing that our daughter will have human features like everybody else here in earth, I can find a doctor to do the last prenatal tests, and help me with the final weeks of pregnancy.” “Let us choose an obstetrician as soon as possible here in Los Angeles. Your teachers should know a good medical professional to indicate us. I’m glad you made the preliminary tests in the ship.” “I’ll take a license from college stop my classes for a few months. Despite being a doctor on my planet, I need to study medicine according to the rules of this country in order to work here and get a degree in Genetics one day.” “I’m sure we will be very happy!” Nicolas said, rubbing her huge belly and kissing her on the lips.” “It looks like someone heard what you said.” Zara commented feeling Helen kicking. “This name I chose means torch or light and is derived from Greek mythology. Helen was the daughter of Zeus and Leda – a demigod. I think it is a name with a beautiful pronunciation and its history is even more beautiful!” “Have you been studying ancient history?” “I always wanted to choose the name of our daughter, so I looked for one that could express the light this girl will bring into our lives.” “I like this name and everything else that comes from you.” Nicolas kissed her belly to show his affection for his daughter. He smiled with happiness. He felt he was living moments of glory by winning a beautiful wife and a daughter, a gift that would be born from their love. *** The date of the birth approached, and Zara already felt that at any moment her bag would burst. She began to feel the pressure increasing day by day and in the last prenatal exam she was told by her doctor to take antihypertensive drugs to prevent the risk of eclampsia. The increased blood pressure could reduce the amniotic fluid, called oligohydramnios, and it also could cause fetal distress putting the baby’s life in danger. Zara knew all of this, and she and Nicolas decided that due to the proximity of the birth it would be better to be in the hospital until the time the baby was born. Lorena was in the hospital with Zara while she was preparing herself for Helen’s arrival. Nicolas also took a leave from college to be able to follow the delivery. Several 3D ultrasounds were performed to verify the position of the fetus and the girl’s heart rate was monitored to see if she responded well to medication. After a few days at the hospital it was finally time for the delivery. The future father was nervous because it was his first time. Zara was also anxious, and the personal experience of being a mother was something new and challenging for her, despite being a doctor and having seen and tracked multiple births on her planet. The obstetrician preferred to make a cesarean section due to the risks, and the couple readily agreed. The recovery would take a little longer because of the sutures, but the reduction of the risks would be worth it. Merko and Sophia were visiting them in the hospital, and Lorena remained next to the Zara. The doctor examined the pregnant woman along with the nursing staff and she was transferred to the operating room. Pre-anesthetic was done, and only after the anesthesia the father could enter the room to closely monitor the medical procedures. Nicolas put the clothes to enter the operating room and took his camera to film all the magical moments and all the details. The labor began, and Zara was half asleep under the effects of sedatives, when a cry of newborn echoed in the operating room. Helen was born. The father looked at his daughter, still bloody and bathed by the fluids from her mother’s womb, and smiled with joy. He couldn’t contain the feeling that took hold of his soul. My God, it’s not possible. Thank you for this moment. My daughter was born! Nicolas said in a prayer just in his mind. The pediatrician saw the child providing her the first care and then the nurse wrapped the baby; put her in the lap of the father who was awkwardly trying to find a best position to hold her. The mother remained in the obstetric center, waiting for the end of the C-section. Outside, the relatives were asking questions to the doctors every time someone came out of the surgery area, and they telling the good news: “A beautiful girl was born; the baby and her mother are well.” “I hope the father is well too because he was so nervous that he probably needed medical attention.” Merko said smiling. “Stop with it, honey. My son is fine and certainly is in heaven with the birth of his first daughter.” Helen received a pink bracelet, just like Zara, with the same identification code of the mother, and was taken to a recovery room and inside an incubator for 30 minutes to return to ideal body temperature. The curtain opened and the family was able to meet the baby. Soon after, the nursing staff took the first anthropometric measurements and gave the first vaccines to protect the child. Meanwhile, Zara was taken to a recovery room and remained there for an hour, after they took the baby to stay with her and start encouraging her to the first breastfeeding. The mother, seeing that her daughter had already taken her bath and smelled like a baby, was mesmerized by joy and could only smile. She was still half asleep because of the effect of the anesthesia. Then, they were taken to the room where they could receive visitors. Lorena had separate kits with clothes for the baby like diapers and socks. So, after each bath they just had to pick up and use a kit that was already prepared. She had chosen, together with Zara, girl clothes and each one was more beautiful than the other. They also had won many gifts from friends who visited them, and, mostly, they were baby clothes. “People really like to give child’s clothes as gifts. I love it!” Zara thought whenever she won them. Nicolas stayed all the time beside his wife, who was feeding the baby. He took her little one in his lap, feeling how good it was to be a father and promising to protect and care for his daughter. “What a beautiful baby!” Lorena said, seeing her granddaughter for the first time. “I brought a hot pink blanket for this adorable baby who was just born. Can I hold her a little bit?” “It is obvious that you can take her, my mother in law.” Lorena took the girl in her arms and smelled that delicious scent of baby. “What a delight to be able to hold a child in my arms again.

Lorena said: “Put her on the left arm and support her with you right hand underneath.” The girl was sleeping peacefully showing how comfortable she was on in his arms. “What a cute little thing!” Merko said. “Merko, you’re good with kids.” Nicolas said smiling. Merko smiled back enjoying that single moment which he may never have lived if he didn’t make the decision to travel back with Nicolas and Zara to the planet Earth. Then Sophia took her in her arms and was delighted since it was the first time she held up a baby.

      "content": "– XXIII. The Family – Earth – Year 2028 Nicolas’ family had increased since he met Zara and his father, Merko, who was transformed with his security company and now lived with Lorena and Sophia in Bel Air – in an upscale residential neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Nicolas and Zara also moved to this neighborhood, to be closer to his family. The doctor had a degree and was working on a clinic in downtown Los Angeles. Nicolas began to work in the Physics Research Center in California, also in the same city. Helen was 10 years old and had light brown hair. She liked to wear her hair braided, and when she let it loose, it got very curly. Sophia, now 18, was preparing herself to attend the Environmental Engineering Course at college, and was determined to be a great engineer. Zara always guided her in her career, which was promising, and taught her the importance of preserving ecosystems for the future of humanity. Lorena and Merko lived happily, taking care of the little Helen, while Nicolas dedicated himself to his work. Over the time Merko started to work less in his security firm. He believed it was time to enjoy life besides the people he loved. Helen excelled in school, studying many subjects and learning them easily. Zara, besides working in her clinic, also began teaching Medical Genetics and working on research projects at the same university where Nicolas worked, however, what she really liked was the genetic research; but even if she was part of some project, she couldn’t advance with innovations beyond the time in which she now lived. Her knowledge exceeded the boundaries of her time, but she should not change the chronology of scientific discoveries. Therefore, she developed projects of researches compatible with the level of development of the time she was living. She couldn’t let all her knowledge erupt in the work, because it would create a time paradox of immeasurable proportions. “Nicolas sometimes I want to move a bit with the knowledge that is far behind in Biogenetic. We are in the XXI century, and I could just show humanity the cure for many diseases such as cancer and neurological degeneration. I see people looking for the cure of these illnesses, and I could help a little, maybe just showing them the correct direction. We could save thousands of lives.” “Zara, this would go against the ethics and the laws that control the temporal space travel. Life is already complicated because of the facts that we don’t anticipate, how more complicated it will become if we change the course of history?” “How many lives we could save accelerating scientific processes? But you’re right, dear Nick. We have no right to change history. It’s already enough the effort we make to change events with our own existence.” “The important thing, Zara, is that we’re together. Our lives and our family are gifts from heaven. And we do what we like.” At this time, he touched the skin of her hand and pulled her to him, kissing her lips with everything. They remained kissing for a few minutes as if it were the first time. After hugging him Zara thought about her own family: “I miss my father and brother who are living in Vida. I’ll try to open a communication channel with them at night, to see if everything is okay.” “Don’t worry. We can go to the ship with Merko because he wants to check if everything is in order in the case of an emergency. So you can talk to your family using the ships communication’s tools. *** Some years had passed, since her arrival on planet Earth, and the longing began to tighten Zara’s heart, which kept remembering her relatives and friends from the other planet. She often spoke with the closest people she knew by the apparatus of Merko’s ship, which was still hidden. But after so many years, the conversation began to seem too distant and insufficient to placate the longing, which increased more and more. She watched the stars for hours at night and looked toward the Andromeda galaxy. During one night, someone approached her from behind and put both hands on her eyes: “Can you guess who it is?” “Of course, you fool. I could recognize these hands and this voice anywhere.” She said, putting her hands over his and smiled as she turned. “Were you watching your galaxy? The sky is very bright tonight.” “And the moon is full. I got lost in time and stay here for hours looking at the sky and missed all the life I left behind on my planet. I wonder if they are alright.” “I believe so. Merko will contact Drako and you can ask for permission to visit them in person. So we’ll know all the news.” “I like our life here on Earth. You and Helen complete me, but I would like to visit the ones I left in there.” “When Merko decided to go we’ll go with him. It will be better, because he’s an expert in interstellar navigation.” “I’ll wait anxiously for this opportunity. I hope it won’t too long, because I miss them so much.” “We could take Helen with us. She loves to talk about the stars and I’m sure it would be a huge surprise to her.” Nicolas suggested. “I don’t know. I think it’s too early for her to understand how we are different from other humans. One day we’ll have to reveal the truth, but there will be the right time and place. What about Lorena and Sophia? Do you think they should know about us?” “No...! Definitely not, they would freak out! Imagine when they see you and Merko in your real alien form? They may not accept this could destroy our family. And how will Merko explain the fact that he’s my father? It’s better to leave things as they are. If we are traveling, we can find an excuse and we can go back in time arriving here by the time we left.” “I agree with you, sweetheart. It would be wiser not to comment with Lorena and Sophia about our planet and keep our lives normal. As for Helen, one day we’ll tell her with more details and after preparing her.” “I trust you dear. Everything happens at the right time. For the good of us all.” Nicolas pulled her close to him and hugged her. Then held her hand and stood up. They went to Helen’s room and she was sleeping deep, and they went to their own room to rest and sleep. He knew he had to find a way to take her to visit her planet. He had promised some time ago that he would take her to see her beloved ones and felt she needed to see them. Zara had adapted very well to her new home. She enjoyed her work at the University and caring for her husband and daughter, Helen, but she still missed her home planet and those she had left behind. *** While Nicolas spoke with Zara at the University, Merko took Helen to school. In the back seat of the car, she asked: “Grandpa, why are you always looking at the sky at night, when you are on the balcony of your house?” “My little Helen, the most beautiful things of this world and what I love more after you and your grandmother of course are the stars!” “One of these days, will you take me to the planetarium? I’d like to know a little more of the galaxies beyond what I learn in school. I feel that something up there attracts me.” “Of course I can take you, dear.” On the following weekend, Merko fulfilled his promise and took her to the planetarium. It was a circular shaped building with a large ball at the top imitating a planet, which could be seen for almost the entire neighborhood. During the night, the building had many colored lights, projecting different shapes and bright designs including over the sphere. Tourists circulated through the ground floor, where panels showed the various exhibitions and lectures that took place there. Many schools were visiting in groups. Merko and Helen entered a video room where a teacher from the planetary gave a demonstration lesson about the origin of the universe. There were pictures on screens positioning in the four walls around them, planets and stars hanging from the ceiling above. He spoke and showed the planets and images projected on all sides. After seeing the galaxies, pictures of dinosaurs appeared, and Helen got a little scared. “Grandpa Merko, what horrible creatures! Did they really exist? How could humans live here, if these terrible animals dominated the planet?” “My granddaughter, humans appeared here thousands of years after these animals were destroyed.” “How did they disappear?” “It’s a long story. Maybe someday I’ll tell you. But today, we need to take our time to learn about the universe.” Merko replied, knowing there was a good story that would take hours to be told. “Okay. I won’t forget that you promised to tell me this story. I’m enjoying this place so much that I don’t even know where to look. The universe is wonderful!” Helen said with a look of admiration. Merko sat on a bench with her and the two of them were enjoying an ice cream when he began to tell a story about his adventures, when he needed to deflect a meteor from their planet, and Silion, his great friend, had saved him from certain death. He used the figure of a galaxies traveling hero for her to imagine how it happened. It wasn’t yet the right moment for the girl to know who her grandfather really was. So he used fictional characters. “Grandpa, your stories seem to have actually happened. I love to hear you talking about these adventures.” Suddenly she looked at the main gate and said: “Look, Grandpa, what a cool toy! Could you buy one of these toys that looked like our galaxy?” The toy consisted in eight planets, accompanied by a sun made of a material similar to acrylic, simulating our solar system. They had the colors, shapes and size characteristics of the stars and were very similar to the real ones. “We’ll buy one when we leave here.” Merko replied. They entered another room that was showing the pictures of how the planet was formed with its volcanoes. A melon was placed in a screen, split in half; its shell represented the earth’s crust, and its interior was the outer and inner garment; its center, the solid core surrounded by the outer liquid core. The speaker explained that the Earth’s core, full of metal, was responsible for the Earth’s magnetic field. Then he showed how comets can pass near the planet Earth and how they are bright and, sometimes, visible to the naked eye. The images and explanations left the girl’s eyes widened with so much attention, and her grandfather felt that sooner or later the evolved human condition would erupt in Helen and nothing would be able to prevent it. *** At night, Zara went to Helen’s room and the girl’s toys, which imitated the planets and the sun from our Orion arm, were spinning around the room, while the little one slept her deepest sleep. She seemed to smile as she slept. Zara ran down the stairs and called Nicolas and Merko to show them what had happened. “Nick, Merko! Come with me to Helen’s room and see with your own eyes.” “It is simply magnificent! Helen is, in a way, using telekinetic powers without realizing it, while sleeping.” Said Merko impressed with what he saw. “Will she be able to develop this skill if she’s awake?” Commented Nicolas, who was also amazed. “We need to teach her how to control these powers. Imagine if she does something like this close to other kids at school?” Zara completed. “This could put her in a difficult position and put her in danger.” They were worried about the safety of the girl. Now there was one more reason for maintaining the secret identities of Nicolas’ extraterrestrial family members, who lived on planet Earth. The future held many dangers they would have to face, and the union would be the best way to survive what was about to come. – The End –",

They had the colors, shapes and size characteristics of the stars and were very similar to the real ones. “We’ll buy one when we leave here.” Merko replied. They entered another room that was showing the pictures of how the planet was formed with its volcanoes. A melon was placed in a screen, split in half; its shell represented the earth’s crust, and its interior was the outer and inner garment; its center, the solid core surrounded by the outer liquid core. The speaker explained that the Earth’s core, full of metal, was responsible for the Earth’s magnetic field. Then he showed how comets can pass near the planet Earth and how they are bright and, sometimes, visible to the naked eye. The images and explanations left the girl’s eyes widened with so much attention, and her grandfather felt that sooner or later the evolved human condition would erupt in Helen and nothing would be able to prevent it. *** At night, Zara went to Helen’s room and the girl’s toys, which imitated the planets and the sun from our Orion arm, were spinning around the room, while the little one slept her deepest sleep. She seemed to smile as she slept. Zara ran down the stairs and called Nicolas and Merko to show them what had happened. “Nick, Merko! Come with me to Helen’s room and see with your own eyes.” “It is simply magnificent! Helen is, in a way, using telekinetic powers without realizing it, while sleeping.” Said Merko impressed with what he saw. “Will she be able to develop this skill if she’s awake?” Commented Nicolas, who was also amazed. “We need to teach her how to control these powers. Imagine if she does something like this close to other kids at school?” Zara completed. “This could put her in a difficult position and put her in danger.” They were worried about the safety of the girl. Now there was one more reason for maintaining the secret identities of Nicolas’ extraterrestrial family members, who lived on planet Earth. The future held many dangers they would have to face, and the union would be the best way to survive what was about to come. – The End –",
