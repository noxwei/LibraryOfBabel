      "content": "A Quick Note!After a couple of reviews and emails commenting on grammar and spelling errors, I thought I’d explain. My work is edited thoroughly, and some grammar and spelling will differ from US English. For example, color to colour or focusing instead of focussing. But I type as I imagine the characters to speak. I’ve been around several MC’s and also know a good many bikers, and believe me, they don’t watch their grammar! So you may find errors when one of the characters speak; that’s intentional! Even educated characters may drop their p’s and q’s from time to time, and we’ll let them off because we love them so much!Drake may use don’t instead of doesn’t, it don’t make sense instead of it doesn’t make sense. Or I be angry instead of I am angry! Or Phoe may say me and you instead of the grammatically correct you and I. They also drop words, possibly one of my own personal pet peeves! You won’t do it becomes won’t do it, or it ain’t right turns into ain’t right. However, typos are not deliberate, and if you find any, I sincerely apologise!I hope you enjoy the book because I write from the heart and genuinely love my Rage MC characters and the world I’m creating around them.Elizabeth.",

      "content": "Prologue.April 2016Rock lifted his head from where he was working on a car as a car door slammed shut in temper, and then a second slam echoed. Curiously, Rock gazed at the scene unfolding on the forecourt.“God damn fucking frigid bitch,” a voice hollered, not caring who was present. Unamused, Rock grabbed a rag and wiped his hands and walked out of the bay. His eyes widened as Carly stormed towards the bays. The dickhead she’d been seeing was storming after her, and Carly stopped dead and turned on her heels to confront him. Rock shook his head; he’d no idea why Carly insisted on dating these preppy jerks.“You piece of trash,” Carly hissed, her hands going to her hips, and she leaned forward, facing the dickhead.“Yeah, Carly, you’re a fucking tease. Showing legs, tits and ass and not fucking putting out.” “Why the fuck would I put out?” Carly snarled back. Rock took the wall and leaned against it, and watched carefully.“Taken you out for three weeks, and you don’t even let me get my hand in your pants,” dickhead snarled back.“Oh, so a few meals and a cinema date means I spread my legs? Well, fuck, I need a bunch of flowers before I do that,” Carly snapped, and Rock felt amusement.“Well, we know where you come from.”“Oh, because I work at Made by Rage, it makes me a whore?” Carly snarled, her temper igniting. Then, outraged, she flipped her hair back and pointed a finger.“Put out for a biker and not a decent guy.” Woah, Rock straightened. That was a direct attack against Rage and Carly.“Decent guy? Decent guy?” Carly shrieked. “A decent guy doesn’t think that taking a girl for a meal entitles him to get in her pants!” Rock’s mouth twitched.“Well, everyone knows easy pussy hangs around Rage.” Carly received as an answer.“Well, you can go back and tell your little pals that you ain’t got a hook in Rage like you were bragging. Oh yeah,” Carly sneered as his body rolled back, “I heard you last night, telling your buds that you had an in to the MC. Fucking prick. Rage takes real men, not little boys.” Rock snorted, and their heads turned towards him. He looked down at himself, motorcycle boots, faded jeans, white wife-beater, and bearded. Rock then looked at dickhead, pressed jeans, cowboy boots, the fancy kind, pressed white shirt and a v-necked jumper over the top, pink at that.Carly didn’t hesitate; she turned to dickhead and looked him up and down, and smirked. Then, deliberately, Carly turned to Rock and checked him over and shot him a look of pure, unadulterated lust that rocked him back on his heels.“Oh yeah,” Carly breathed, “Real men, not little boys.” Rock eyed her warily. Carly was up to something, and he wondered what she planned.“Dirty bitch,” dickhead sneered. Carly shot him a glance, and her mouth engaged.“Wanna see what you’re missing out on, little boy.” Carly waggled her little finger at him, and the meaning was not lost on those watching. Dickhead went puce in fury. Carly strutted her shit across to Rock and slid her hands into his hair. Without a word she yanked his head down, and her mouth slammed into his.The second his mouth touched hers, Rock didn’t hesitate. For two years, he’d watched Carly, and this was it. He was having her. His mouth took over, and the kiss heated. Hands slid to her ass and cupped it, pulling her against him. Carly’s mouth opened, and Rock slid his tongue in, duelling with hers. Carly leaned into Rock, pressing her tits against him, and she went fucking wild.Rock hooked a hand under Carly’s leg and drew it up, pressing his cock into her. Carly, in return, wrapped her leg around his and hauled herself up Rock’s body like she was Artemis climbing Ace. Carly’s hands gripped his hair harder. Rock broke the kiss off and gazed into enormous brown eyes. They were dazed and full of lust. Carly’s mouth was swollen and soft, and he found he really fucking liked that expression on her. Her legs were wrapped around his waist, with one hand on her ass, the other in her hair.“Shit, you fucking whore,” dickhead hissed furiously. Rock lifted his head and stared straight at him. He saw Lowrider standing near, looking amused, and gently passed Carly off to him and then began striding towards dickhead, who started moving backwards fast. His ass hit his car, and he began sliding around it just as Rock reached him.“No man calls a Rage woman whore. No man remains standin’ after he calls a Rage woman whore. Any man who is a man makes sure that when a Rage woman is called a whore, he puts that trash out and makes sure it stays out,” Rock gritted. Dickhead turned from bright red to pure white in seconds. Rock put one hand on the dickhead and pushed hard, and dickhead stumbled backwards. Rock smirked as the kid nearly pissed himself. He watched through narrow eyes as dickhead scrambled for his footing.Rock opened the car door and shoved dickhead into it, and began counting. Dickhead didn’t hesitate, pushed the car into reverse and sped away. Rock turned around and saw Carly’s pert ass hurrying across the forecourt towards Made by Rage. Oh yeah, baby, you can run, but you can’t fuckin’ hide, he thought to himself and gave an amused Lowrider a chin lift.“Wow, our kitten has claws,” Lowrider said, laughing.“Carly’s got a fuckin’ mouth,” Rock grunted, his own amusement showing.“In more ways than one brother,” Lowrider snorted and then threw his head back and roared with laughter.“Tellin’ me.” An expression of surprise crossed Lowrider’s face when Rock let out a chuckle.“Yeah,” Lowrider said, looking at him.“That bitch is mine,” Rock grunted again and, laughing to himself, returned to work. Run, baby, run. You can’t run fast enough, he thought.◆◆◆ “Oh my God, I kissed Rock! And Rock kissed me back, with tongue!” I exclaimed, running into Made by Rage, Designs by Lindsey. Embarrassed, I skidded to a halt and groaned as Drake’s eyebrows shot up. Apache sent me a surprised but definitely shit-eating grin. Both men had arms around their women, Drake around Phoe, and Apache around Silvie. Phoe had her hands full of Lindsey’s jewellery, and I guessed Phoe was in a buying mood, and Drake was not denying her that. Standing around was every single old lady Rage had.“Oh my God, was Rock good?” Silvie cried out and wheezed as Apache squeezed her.“Not sure what you want me to reply to that, kitten,” Apache drawled, replying to my first statement, and I turned red.“That wasn’t for you,” I replied, embarrassed.“Nope, I’m guessin’ not. Don’t wanna hear you share,” Drake said with more than a hint of humour in his voice.“Oh wow, can Rock kiss?” I felt myself go even redder as Lindsey vaulted the barrier in pure excitement. Apache quickly let go of Silvie to stop Lindsey from falling.“Oh, Rock can so kiss. And I bet with that beard it was hot!” Silvie yelped gleefully as Apache ducked his head.“And I’m outta here,” Drake said, giving Phoe a distracted kiss, distracted on her side as she clearly wished to get the gossip. Drake sighed, tilted Phoe’s head and looked into her eyes. Phoe’s eyes flared, and they kissed again. Far better, Drake’s expression said.“Comin’ with,” Apache said, hurrying out.“Carly kissed Rock? With tongue?” Sin breathed.“How, what happened? Tell us everything!” Penny gasped and dragged me through the barrier towards the staff seating area.“Well, I kissed Rock!” I squealed.“Got that,” said an amused voice, and Marsha and Artemis barrelled through the co-joined Rage Shop and Made by Rage wooden barrier. I spun on Artemis and hopped up and down.“Shit, I kissed Rock. I mean, I walked up to him, and I dragged his head down, and I kissed him!” I said in a high-pitched voice.“Oh my god, Carly, you started the kiss,” Phoe exclaimed.“I’m so proud of you!” Lindsey began jumping up and down as well. “My baby has grown up.”“Rock kiss you back? Hand action?” Ellen asked. Wow, Axel’s old lady was asking me about hand action.“Oh yeah, Rock kissed me back. So hot! I had my hands in his hair; it’s like silk,” I whispered.“Wow, you know, I always thought there was something between you,” Lindsey said. Silvie squealed and bounced on the spot.“I knew it; you’ve had the hots for Rock for years,” Sin squealed, and I glared. “It was magic!” I whispered, thinking of Rock’s mouth on mine.“Was there fireworks?” Autumn asked, settling on the arm of one chair. I blushed again.“There were fireworks,” Artemis nodded. “Ace is like that; intense sexiness and drool-worthy, and I just have to jump him and have hot monkey sex.”“No, I didn’t have hot monkey sex with Rock!” I shouted. “I kissed his ass off, though.”“Woah, wait, you were naked?” Marsha cried excitedly. No, no, they weren’t listening!“No, no nakedness. I wouldn’t mind seeing Rock naked, though. Damn, I bet he’s something naked.” I clapped a hand over my mouth. “What’s wrong with me!”“Um, Rock naked, yeah, I can imagine that. That tight ass, long legs, oh yeah Carly, I bet Rock’s something,” Artemis drawled.“I wanna see Rock naked now,” Phoe said, her eyes drifting off. Damn, did Phoe just say that?“Oh, me too. Rock has always been a yummy brother,” Marsha agreed.“All that smouldering intensity,” Ellen drooled.“I kissed that intensity; it was intense!” I yelped.“Rock kissed you back,” Artemis reminded me.“I climbed him like a tree,” I yelped again.“Oh my God, you climbed him? Hot monkey sex,” Artemis nodded sagely.“You’re not helping!” I cried as Artemis grinned wickedly. “Rock’s going to think I’m a harlot!”“Honey, the guys know you’re not a harlot,” Penny said, laughing. They did? I wasn’t sure about that; I’d been dating a few preppy boys lately, anything to get my mind off Rock.“Rock grabbed my ass and then pulled my leg up to hook around his thigh. I climbed him like a monkey. He’s so hard.” I sighed internally, my mouth just kept engaging.“Rock was hard?” Marsha giggled.“Oh my.” I blushed even more profoundly.“Holy shit. How big is he?” Autumn asked, and I swear she drooled.“Rock’s gonna think I’m a harlot!” I whispered. “I made him kiss me, and I climbed him like a monkey; I put my ass in his hands!”“How did you put your ass in his hands? It’s such a nice ass Carly,” Silvie asked curiously. She craned her head around me to look at my ass. This was getting worse; I couldn’t get my words out and wasn’t making sense.“Rock put his hands on me, and I wriggled my ass into them more!” I said softly.“Bettin’ Rock liked that,” Marsha said, nodding.“Honey, Rock likes you,” Ellen said. My head snapped up. Rock did? The man was one of the most remote brothers, so I knew little about him, except that I gravitated to him like a moth to a flame. Hold on, though…“Yes, but Rock didn’t ask me to force kiss him on the forecourt in front of Lowrider! I forced Rock to kiss me!” I said, panicking. “Oh my God, I attacked Rock and forced him to kiss me. I forced my ass into his hands and climbed him like a monkey. It was fuckin’ great.” I clapped my hands over my mouth again, “I didn’t say that, I didn’t say that!”“Yes, you did!” Lindsey cried gleefully. I was beginning to hate my boss.“In front of Lowrider?” Sin asked, and I nodded.“What did he do?” Lindsey asked.“Which one?” Autumn smirked. Okay, I was beginning to hate Autumn too.“No idea because I ran away when Rock pushed Richard into his car for calling me a whore.”“Rock pushed that dick headed twat?” Penny asked.“Richard called me a whore after I kissed Rock, and Rock then got manly and hard and pushed him into the car, yelling at Richard about Rage women. Again, it was freaking hot!”“Rock definitely likes you.” Silvie nodded her head.“Yeah, but that was before I forced Rock to kiss me.” I dropped my head in despair.“Honey, he wants you. Rock’s eyes get this sexy look when he stares at you,” Ellen stressed.“Rock wouldn’t have let you mount him if he didn’t,” Phoe said.“Oh shit, I did, I mounted him like riding a horse!”“Horse sex doesn’t have the same feel as monkey sex does,” Sin mused. I choked.“Bet Rock’s hung like a horse,” Phoe grinned.“Oh, he’s big.” I nodded.“Hung like a horse big?” Artemis asked slyly.“How the hell do I know? I don’t go around measuring horse dicks!” I shouted, embarrassed. Penny fell in the armchair, laughing her ass off.“I got to leave because I can’t face him,” I said and got instant no’s from the girls.“Rock will hunt you down if you do,” Silvie said, giggling.“If Rock’s hung like a horse, why on earth do you want to leave? You need to naked mount him! You need to ride his ass!” Artemis exclaimed. In horror, I stared at Artemis. Out of all the old ladies, we knew she was the kinkiest and most open about sex. We’d heard countless stories about hers and Ace’s sex life, and yeah, I’d been jealous.“I’m not riding Rock’s ass!” I squealed.“Sheesh, I don’t mean ride his ass, ride his ass, I mean give Rock reverse cowgirl or something,” Artemis grinned. “Ace loves reverse cowgirl; he does this thing with his finger….” Artemis broke off, and her eyes glazed over.“Lowrider does this thing with his finger and cock at the same time; it makes me melt. He’s so freaking hot,” Lindsey shared.“I’m not doing anything to Rock’s ass with my finger,” I said.Howls of male laughter erupted behind us. We gazed across the room to the glass doors that led into the Rage shop, and to my horror, I saw Gunner, Manny, Lowrider and Mac standing there. Mac was bent over laughing so hard, he was shaking, and he’d a phone in his hand.Gunner was holding on to the door laughing; I was struck by that; I’d never seen Gunner laugh. Lowrider was grinning like a monkey, and Manny was bent over like Mac laughing his ass off. They looked at our shocked expressions and carried on laughing. Finally, Mac straightened up and began tapping buttons on his phone.“Gotta send that shit to the guys,” Mac snorted, and before anyone could stop him, he hit send. Mac jumped the barrier, walked over, kissed me on my head and sauntered out.“Where did you record that from?” Phoe asked, her eyes narrowed.“Lindsey vaulting the barrier. Got that shit on tape,” Manny grunted, and the guys left them alone, still chuckling.“Ace will kick your ass,” Artemis shouted after them.“Ace will kick yours for tellin’ about his finger,” Lowrider shot back, and we heard his chuckle.“Your finger is banned from me,” Lindsey called.“Tell me tonight after I’ve done my finger thing,” Lowrider called back, and Lindsey huffed, but we saw the smile on her face. Yeah, Lowrider was still going to do his thing.",

      "content": "Chapter One.Rock heard laughter coming from the bay next to his and straightened up and looked over at Drake and Ace howling. He frowned and carried on tightening the bolts on the wheel he was replacing when they walked in his direction.“Brother, you not seen it?” Drake asked.“Seen what?” Rock grunted. He straightened back up and glanced over at Drake.“Check your phone for a message from Mac,” Ace said, smiling hugely. Rock still had trouble relating to this new Ace. The old version of Ace hadn’t smiled in years. This version smiled and laughed. That shit was weird, but Rock was happy for his brother. Idly contemplating Ace’s happiness, Rock wiped his hands on a rag and pulled his phone from a pocket.Curiously flicking it on, Rock saw a message from Mac and hit play. Rock’s mouth twitched in amusement as Drake and Ace came closer. Rock was full-on laughing when Marsha asked if he was hard. Ace and Drake were both laughing as Rock reached the end of the video. Rock hit replay and laughed all the way through it.“Those fuckin’ women,” Drake snorted.“Christ, that’s some funny shit,” Ace said.“Damn, you got your hands full with Artemis, brother,” Drake said, amused.“Woman loves her monkey sex. Thinks her pussy’s been abused if she don’t get it at least six times a week,” Ace laughed.“Too much info,” Rock grunted, but his eyes gave away his amusement.“Third set of twins coming up,” Drake teased, and Rock snorted.“Carly likes you,” Ace said. Christ, what was this? The male version of the women’s clatch?“Yeah,” Rock nodded; he wasn’t stupid; he’d seen the glances Carly sent his way. “Thirty-one. Had to wait for the girl to grow older.” Ace shot Rock a look.“Brother, you wanted Carly the moment she first walked into Rage.” “Think I hit that cunt pimp harder than you,” Rock replied.“Shit, the girl was eighteen.”“Nineteen now. Carly’s a woman, girl’s twenty next month.”“Unchartered territory,” Drake mused.“Know that brother, Carly’s held on to her virginity. Means when I take Carly, she’ll be tied to me tight,” Rock said. Ace looked at him with something close to amazement in his eyes.“Kept shit tight, brother,” Ace said, inclining his head.“No need to chat like pussy when girl weren’t mature enough. Made sure Carly’s stayed clean and safe. That kiss today, I know how Carly feels.” Rock turned on his heel and walked back to the bay. Drake turned away and grinned. Another brother about to fall. Good shit was happening for Rage. Drake looked across the forecourt and saw Phoe strutting her ass in her tight skirt and high heels into the HQ offices. Chance had been right. Ever since Phoe had landed on Rage, good things happened.Rock walked into the Made by Rage at five o’clock and saw Lindsey at her sewing machine and Silvie at the front desk. But, casually looking around, he didn’t see Carly. Puzzled, Rock walked through the barrier and stopped near Lindsey.“Where’s Carly?” Rock rumbled. Lindsey looked up with a grin.“Carly asked to finish early, said she had a doctor’s appointment. So she’ll be at home in truth.”“Girl’s running.”“Yeah,” Lindsey whispered. “Rock, you know….” “Yeah, I know, Lindsey.”“Carly’s never….” Rock bent over and got in Lindsey’s face.“Honey, I know Carly’s untouched. Gonna be gentle with her, babe,” Rock assured Lindsey, wondering why the fuck he was doing so. But then again, these women had their men by their dicks. The men knew it and honestly didn’t care. The men owned these women heart and soul and loved that. Rock straightened up and left the building.Rock rode to Carly’s piece of shit apartment. The girl refused to move out, desperately saving for a deposit on a sweet little house. Carly had first lived with Silvie and then in a cottage on Phoe and Drake’s estate before moving here four months ago. Rock had heard Carly speak about her dream, and he’d bought into it. The girl had a dream he wanted to see her live. Carly had walked into their lives nearly two years ago. She’d taken Lindsey’s back through her shit and then Silvie’s. Rock’s girl had loyalty.Carly was shy and mainly stayed away from forming relationships. But the women had developed their own sisterhood, and she’d been accepted into their circle. Lindsey and Silvie both had taken Carly under their wing. Carly was shy and skittish around most men, including his brothers. Still, as Rock had seen today, Carly had a temper, and it was fuckin’ attractive. How dickhead had got Carly to date him, Rock didn’t understand, but dickhead was gone from her life now.No one knew much concerning her private life. Carly hadn’t shared and clearly didn’t intend to. When Carly had turned up at Rage, she’d owned two pairs of jeans and three tees and a pair of battered sneakers. Lindsey had treated the girl well and bought her a shit load of clothes.Rock pulled up outside the apartment block and got off the bike. He jogged across the parking lot and waited to let a battered black SUV pass. Rock glanced up as it passed and saw Carly sitting inside, face pale and head tucked low. Then, as if Carly sensed him, Carly’s head snapped up, and her mouth opened slightly. Carly raised a hand to the window, and her slender fingers bent on the glass, and Carly looked at him. Rock sensed the sadness in her, and it hit deep. Carly held his eyes until the car passed him. Rock felt it, felt it deep. That was goodbye.◆◆◆ October 2016. Six months later.Rock heard the car pull up and lifted his head to look. An old nineteen seventy-five Chevrolet Vega in a fuckin’ awful mustard yellow clanked into a parking space. It was a rusting shit heap and a miracle it drove. Rock’s eyes met Lowriders across the forecourt, and he began walking out of the bay and stopped.One skinny jean-clad leg threw out of the car, and then a second and she got out. A good, easy forty pounds lighter than when she’d left. Her face was drawn and worn out, hair cropped short as if it had been cut with shears and clothes sagging from her frame. Arms so thin she resembled a skeleton. Carly stopped, tipped her head back, and breathed. The tension fell from her shoulders, and Carly relaxed instantly.Her gaze snapped across to his, and Carly stopped dead on the spot. The girl was pale, so ashen he was shocked. Rock stared for a few moments, turned his back on Carly, and walked to his bike. Throwing a leg over it, Rock rode out without a word.Sadly, I watched as Rock left me standing there. And I couldn’t blame him. Months had passed since I’d spoken to anyone from Rage. Not since my brothers arrived out of the blue and dragged me back to the previous horror of my life. They’d sold my phone before we even arrived back at the trailer. Yeah, I’d left because they’d been staking out Made by Rage and threatened to harm the girls.Blackmailed, I went home and once again cleaned up my brothers and father’s shit. Until three nights ago when my father choked to death on vomit, and I watched. And I didn’t call for help. No, I watched Dad watch me, watch him choke to death. Hate in both our eyes. Within minutes of Dad’s death, I packed up my stuff, took his piece of shit car, and drove into town to report it to the police. There, I spoke to them for fifteen minutes before they followed me back and carted him away. The cops didn’t care, my family were pieces of shit, and I didn’t care either, so I left.Escape looming before me, I traded Dad’s car and bought this one with cash and came to where I hoped home was. Lowrider stood watching me, and I glanced at him and saw his face was closed. Slowly, I walked over to Lowrider, trying to keep my feet and balance, and looked him in the face.“Shit’s over,” I told him. Lowrider blinked. “He’s dead, they’re safe, it’s finished. Totally over. And I’m free,” I said and blacked out.◆◆◆ Confused, I woke up in a soft bed and sniffed the air. Someone moved close by, and I braced for a blow, and someone cursed lightly. Oh, thank God, I knew that voice. It signalled safety. I opened my eyes and saw Lowrider sitting near me, Lindsey by his side. Drake and Silvie stood behind them and were watching me, their faces closed.Although it was warm, I was shivering in the bed violently, and I couldn’t get control of it. My head was killing me, and my muscles pained me, cramping as I moved. Bile rose in my throat, and I leant over the bed and threw up. That was a complete waste of time; I hadn’t eaten for days. As well as the pain in my head, it was foggy, and I couldn’t concentrate.“Carly?” Lowrider asked, crouching near the head of the bed.“Lowrider, safety,” I muttered. “Doc Paul’s visited; you’ve bronchitis, and he says pneumonia. Doc’s treating you with antibiotics,” Lowrider said. That hurt. Lowrider’s voice was distant, missing its usual warmth when he addressed me.“Let me sleep in a bed, not had a bed for months. Let me sleep once, and I’ll leave. Just give me tonight.”“Where you been sleepin’?” Drake asked harshly.“With the dogs in their shelter. Just give me tonight. Please,” I begged. Drake’s face hardened. Violently, I started shivering even worse and curled up in a ball. My nose was stuffy, and my eyes were swollen; I was amazed I could open them. My throat was on fire, which didn’t help matters. The truth was, I’d driven three days like this, concentrating hard on the road so not to cause an accident.Desperate to get home, I’d slept and eaten in the car, and I was down to my last three bucks. The only thing I understood was, I had to reach Rage. When Elrond and Barney had dragged me from here, they hadn’t got my bank cards as I left them at the shop in the safe. Back then, I’d had strange looks from the brothers but was thankful I’d done that now. There was money in the bank.Otis and Chester had been pissed when Elrond and Barney brought me back with no money. Elrond had assumed it was in my purse, and they had freaked when they realised I’d nothing but twenty bucks on me. Dad had given me a backhander when I gloated that Rage had my money. And then my shit life re-started.“In a dog’s shelter?” Silvie gasped.“One night. Just one night in a bed out of the last few months,” I whispered as my eyes closed and I fell back to sleep.◆◆◆ “What the fuck happened to Carly?” Lindsey asked, whirling on Lowrider the minute they got into the common room.“That’s a question I want answering,” Drake muttered. He was dialling Hawthorne as the girls let rip. Drake moved to one side to make a request of Hawthorne. When he turned back, the women were glaring furiously at the brothers.“Carly’s been fucked up,” Silvie ranted from the haven of Apache’s arms.“Carly’s been more than fucked up. Did you see those belt marks on her back?” Lindsey asked softly. Lowrider’s head snapped towards her.“What did you say?” Lowrider bit out. He and Drake had left the room when Doc Paul had examined Carly, and apart from a brusque description of her illness, he had said nothing else. But Doc had looked very pissed off and made one comment to Drake that hadn’t registered. “Stop this happening to your women.” Doc had said and left.“Carly’s been beaten; they’ll scar. Her thighs, ass, back, stomach bear the marks of being beaten with a belt. Welts are that severe; you can see the buckle marks in her skin. Doc Paul didn’t say anything?” Silvie whispered.“Say that again,” a voice growled, and they spun guiltily and saw Rock glowering angrily. Dangerous vibes hit the room, and the women took a step back.“Brother,” Drake said, and raised his hand and then dropped it.“Carly’s been beaten? Any answer to why she ran away from us?” Rock glowered.“Rock, I’m getting the idea Carly had little choice,” Lowrider said carefully. Rock turned in his direction.“No? Lowrider, I was right there. Carly could have given me a sign, and I would’ve followed.”“More to this shit than we understand,” Drake agreed.“Drake, I was right fuckin’ there,” Rock said louder, and Drake and Apache tensed, ready to lock him down.“Carly’s got pneumonia, bronchitis, she’s severely malnourished and dehydrated. Rock, Carly’s been abused,” Drake said firmly, his eyes watching Rock carefully.“With a belt?” Rock snapped, Lindsey nodded, and Apache moved closer. “Pneumonia?” Rock asked.“Bein’ treated, Doc Paul set up intravenous antibiotics. But Carly’s not just suffering from that,” Apache said.“Brief me,” Rock said, and it couldn’t be misconstrued as anything but a demand.◆◆◆ I came awake shivering again, and I was out of it. Somehow, I understood I was out of it, but I couldn’t concentrate on anything. There was a warm body in the bed next to me and strong arms wrapped around me. Happily, I burrowed into them and settled back down in warmth.Thirsty, I was so thirsty, I was begging for water. Someone held a glass to me, and I drank greedily, but they pulled it away before I got a few sips. Please, I begged and cried, and someone soothed me, and I chased the darkness again.Too hot, I kicked the blankets off, someone drew them back up me. No, I struggled and kicked them off a second time and begged for water. My eyes were so sore and swollen I couldn’t see shit. Water, I needed to drink, and the sheets were too hot. Maybe I told them that. Desperately, I told them not to get my brothers. The darkness swallowed me whole again.Confused, I woke up as someone shifted and wrapped me tight. Frightened, I struggled against them and stopped when a voice I dimly knew spoke to me. A glass touched my lips, and I drank water and burrowed into the warm solid body at my side. Hands touched my hair, and it felt nice. I told him that and other secret stuff and fell back to sleep.Jeez, I woke and threw up again. Crazily crying, I apologised, repeatedly begging them not to throw me outside where it was cold. I said I wasn’t sorry for watching Dad die and not getting help. Repeatedly, I said Dad deserved it. That the asshole beat me, and so I watched him die. Wasn’t it funny that I couldn’t call for help for Dad, as they’d sold my phone? I yelled I was gonna dance on Dad’s grave and party like there was no tomorrow.I told him it was safe for everyone, no one was watching Made by Rage, and it was safe. They could come out now. The truth was, I’d achieved what I’d set out to do. I’d saved the old ladies. My brothers wouldn’t harm them now because the asshole was dead. Shit was worth everything to see Silvie and Apache in love and to watch Lowrider vault over the barriers to kiss his wife. I had done it, made them safe. Arms clenched tightly around me.Babbling, I told him each hit from the belt didn’t hurt because I’d a home, a secret home I knew I return to safely. I screamed at them that they couldn’t take that away from me; I was liked there and loved. There, I had friends, they couldn’t take that from me, they could beat me till I bled, but they couldn’t take my home and friends. Sneakily I admitted the asshole could beat me until I was unconscious, but all he’d do is send me to heaven where that man was. The man with beautiful eyes and a smile that lit up my entire world.Happily, I talked about how I liked a guy, he was big and strong, and I’d kissed him once. Just once, and he’d let me climb him like a monkey. Like Ace let Artemis. The guy was everything drool-worthy in a man. Good and kind, funny and gentle, he was loyal and brave and loved his brothers and sometimes, when he looked at me, I felt special. That there was a link between him and me. I wanted under his skin like he was under mine. A chin rested on my head, and I was hauled across the bed into his arms. I told him it felt nice.◆◆◆ My eyes popped open, and I woke up alone and stretched. Damn, I felt better, Christ, did I feel better. The sheets were wrapped around my legs like I used to do as a child and tucked under my feet. My mouth tasted like I’d eaten an ashtray, and my eyes itched like they were on gritty stalks. I rubbed my eyes and tried to get the junk out of them. A glass of water sat on the side table, and I grabbed and drank it before sinking back into the bed.Crap, I was so damn weak, and I knew I’d lost even more weight. Unhappy, I looked at my arms, shocked to see how thin they were, whatever. So be it. The plan was to get to my bank, get my money, and leave Rapid City. Rage had made it pretty clear I wasn’t welcome. With that simple plan in mind, I climbed out of bed and realised I was in a bunk at Rage’s clubhouse. I gazed around a relatively tidy room that I didn’t know, I do stress relatively. Gingerly putting my feet on the floor, I ignored the chill and, sniffing, knew I needed a shower.My hand was sore and looking, I saw a canula inserted, and I followed the tubing of a drip up to a stand holding two nearly empty bags. With a shrug, I reached out and held onto the frame and began pushing it towards the bathroom. On the way, I stopped at the chest of drawers and pulled out a tee. Don’t know who it belonged to, and I didn’t care.The principal thing was the tee was clean, cleaner than me, and that was what mattered. I struggled with the stand but managed to get into the shower. I didn’t care which brother’s room I was in, so I used his shower gel and shampoo and borrowed his razor and shaved my legs and under my arms. Just doing those small things took my remaining strength. Warily, I looked in the cupboard over the sink but could only find one toothbrush.None of the brothers had fatal diseases that I knew about. Vigorously I brushed my teeth for a full five minutes. I couldn’t stop scrubbing. Finally, when my gums began to bleed, I stopped and rinsed. I found a comb and brushed it through my butchered hair. There was no point drying it as it would air-dry quickly. I dragged on the tee and found it a bit awkward as I had to thread the drips through the sleeve.A mirthless chuckle escaped me as the tee dropped to my knees. Cautiously, I left the bathroom after hanging my towel out and throwing the toothbrush in the bin. The room was still empty. The owner hadn’t returned. Unbalanced, I placed my hand against the wall and used my other hand to push the stand towards the door. Damn, I was shattered by the time I reached it, but I hadn’t given up when I got in the car; I would not give up now.I opened the door and began walking across the concrete floor towards the rec room. Muted laughter and chat drifted towards me, but I’d no idea of the time. Music was playing and getting louder as I got closer to the rec room. Carefully leaning on the wall, I stood in the entrance and swallowed back tears.The space looked no different, shabbier and possibly more cluttered, and the brothers were present. They slouched in chairs and sofas and sat at the bar. Apache and Ace, Artemis clinging to Ace’s back with arms and legs wrapped around him, played pool in the corner. Hunter and Blaze were having an aggressive game of air hockey. I checked and saw Lowrider in an armchair with Lindsey curled on his lap, his arms around her. Silvie was opposite them with Chance, the president of Hellfire and two of his brothers, Pyro and Banshee, better known as Shee. Two candidates, Klutz and Gauntlet, were serving Drake, Texas, Axel and Fish at the bar. Mac was flicking through TV channels even though the music was blaring, and Gunner lounged full length on another sofa. Autumn lay across his body. Manny and Slick looked to be playing chess, both deep in concentration.But I didn’t see Ezra, Lex, Marsha or the man who had been avoiding me, Rock. Phoe had her ass in Bear’s lap, the VP from Hellfire. I also spied Big Al and Chatter sitting relaxing, beer in hand, talking between themselves. Hurt, I clung to the wall hidden in shadows and wished I had a camera to take this snapshot, this snapshot of those I thought of as family.Sadly, I lifted my hand to wipe tears from my eyes, and my movement caught Drake’s sharp gaze. Within seconds, Drake strode over and placed an arm around my waist, supporting me. Drake took my weight and pulled me into him. I smelt leather, man and a scent that I only ever linked with Drake, home.Drake chucked me under the chin, so I lifted my head, and he searched my face. Whatever he saw satisfied him, and Drake lifted me as if I weighed nothing. At this point, I probably didn’t, and Drake carried me across the room. Eyes followed, and although they tracked our progress, no one said anything, just carried on with what they were doing.Drake placed me on an armchair in the old lady’s section near Lowrider, who gave me a warm wink. Lindsey dragged out a bag she had near her feet and passed me a ball of wool and a crochet hook. Confused, I stared for a few minutes, tears in my eyes, as I tried to grasp what Lindsey was telling me, and then I began casting on. A few minutes later, Blaze placed a coke near my chair on a rickety table and left me alone.Scared of believing, I kept my head down, concentrating on the wool, not knowing what to make of what was happening. My arrival had been met with tenseness and a vibe I was unwanted. Now I was settled in the midst of Rage and Hellfire, and no one was saying anything. My brain, although no longer foggy and muzzy, was definitely confused.The clubhouse doors opened, and in walked the missing members of Rage, Ezra, Lex, Marsha and Manny, followed by the missing old ladies. Behind them came three further Hellfire members, Tiny, Celt and Diesel. They carried bags, and the smell of Chinese wafted in my direction. They put the bags on the bar, and the candidates began handing out containers.My head remained dipped when suddenly, arms wrapped around me, and I was lifted and curled into muscled solid arms. My ass hit a lap, and those arms remained carefully tight around me. A beard nuzzled into my neck, and my startled eyes met Rock’s soft brown ones. Rock grinned and relaxed, drawing me close against his chest. Gently, Rock kept his arm away from the wounds on my back. Jett placed containers on a table, and reaching out with one hand, Rock snagged one.His other hand hanging over my shoulder snagged my wool, tucked it behind us, and Rock popped off the container lid. Rock grabbed the fork that Jett had put on top of the containers and forked up a mouthful of noodles, which he raised and held to my mouth. I looked at Rock in surprise.“Open up, babe,” Rock rumbled, and I sensed it deep in his chest. Obediently, I opened up and, like a baby bird, he fed me. Disbelievingly, I shook my head after a few bites, and Rock’s eyes narrowed, but he ate the rest. Next, Rock pulled out a container of prawn toast, which I loved, and a container of chicken satay on skewers. With a teasing air, Rock waved one under my nose, and I snatched it and bit into it. Watchful brown eyes gazed at me as I chewed and swallowed.“More?” Rock asked, and I nodded. Eating a second and third piece of prawn toast, I shook my head at the fourth offering. Eyes randomly checked on us, but no one commented. What was happening? Rock ate one-handed, keeping a hand around my waist and keeping me hooked against his chest. Okay, I leaned my head back and decided if this was a bizarre dream brought on by my illness, I was going to enjoy it.“What’s going on?” I whispered.“Shhh,” Rock said back and bit into a prawn toast. He chewed, and I watched his throat as he swallowed and fought the urge to kiss it. Not knowing where I stood, I behaved myself, but this was hard. This might be my dream, but I wouldn't risk embarrassing myself on the off chance I was reading this situation wrong. Rock glanced down and grinned at me as he read my face. “Go ahead, baby, all yours,” Rock whispered, tilting his head and putting his mouth against my ear. Rock dropped a kiss on the shell, and I shivered. His eyes flared, and I shivered again, and he took on a decidedly smug look.I looked around in bewilderment and saw sneaky glances and cheerful grins in our direction. Silvie looked beside herself, and Lindsey was happily grinning. Embarrassed, I tucked my head under Rock’s chin and closed my eyes. Yeah, I was going to accept this strange new reality, even if I only had tonight. Slowly, I allowed the chat to lull me into a light sleep.Startled, I opened my eyes as Rock lifted me in his arms and, pushing my stand, carried me back to the bedroom. He kicked the door open, carried me in, and laid me on the bed. Rock deftly swapped the two empty bags for full ones and hooked them up. And without saying a word, Rock opened the door and shouted through it to Blaze to get two toothbrushes.Still wordless, Rock stripped off his tee in front of my startled eyes, undid his jeans, and sat on the bed. He tugged off his boots and shucked his jeans, and finally, Rock lay on the bed next to me. With a twist, Rock curled me into his arms. By the time Rock wrapped me up tightly, I was drooling; he was ripped. A well-defined six-pack and pecs, hard tight nipples, and sparse hair trailed to a narrow line leading to his boxers. I glanced up, admiring his body.“You wouldn’t talk to me,” I said. Rock offered an uncomfortable nod. “What’s going on? How long was I out of it?”“Honey, you were out for four days. Doc Paul was ready to admit you when your fever broke, and you began stabilising.”“That answers one of my questions,” I said. Rock gave me a half-smile, and I stared at his mouth. Rock elaborated.“Carly, you’re home, you’re mine, and that’s what’s going on.”“Just like that?” I asked, stunned.“Babe, I watched and waited for two years for you to be comfortable in your skin and to come into your own. You strutted your ass across the forecourt, climbed me and kissed me like no bitch has ever kissed me before. Then before I could move on you, Carly, you drove away without a goodbye. Six months babe, six months we didn’t know where you were, no word, no call, no sighting. I got you back, ain’t letting go, and I’m laying claim to you. Waited long enough.”Wow, I blinked in surprise. Well, that answered the other two questions. I thought over Rock’s words, and as I did so, a hand slid up my back and gently pressed me harder into his side. Restless, my hand with the cannula crept up Rock’s muscular chest and stayed there. Under my hand, Rock’s heart beat steady and robust.“Claiming me for how long?” I asked softly.“Carly, I’m thirty-two; you’re twenty, should let you go to someone better. Someone who’ll give you the white picket fence and shit, not gonna. Carly, I see you, which means babe, I see you. Should let you live a little, not gonna, but I know you’re innocent, which means when you give yourself to me, you’re mine, for life. You got one chance, Carly. Tell me now to go, and I’ll walk. Still take your back but will leave you be, you don’t, you’re mine for good. Get me?” Dazed, I stared at him, really looked at him. Rock was a biker, a brother, and had been Rage for years. He was tall, over six foot two; I was five foot five. Rock towered over me and gave me the sensation of being safe, of being cherished. Rock was lean hipped with long muscled legs, broad shoulders, a broad chest, and a tight ass. He was covered in tattoos, but they weren’t off-putting.Rock’s face wasn’t classically handsome, but it was appealing and eye-catching. There was something compelling about Rock, something that drew a person’s eye. His eyes were a soft brown, and I’d seen them darkened in anger before. Rock’s hair was a shade too long and a dark rich brown, his beard the same. He kept it trimmed short, highlighting sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline.Those brown eyes were steady on mine; he didn’t speak, just let me think. Rock had many qualities I admired; he was funny, calm, steady, loyal, and so much more. He also was hot-tempered, quick to anger, blinkered when it came to his brothers and could be cruel. Rock had never been mean to me, but I’d seen him treat other women who got in his space, like shit.“I get it, babe,” Rock whispered, hope fading in his eyes. He bent and kissed my forehead before gathering his body to get off the bed. I gave a mew of discontent and my hand pressed against his chest. Hope flared again, and I curled into Rock and hooked my leg over his. Rock settled and, holding me tight, tucked his big body around me and held me until I slept.◆◆◆ I woke up to a hand stroking my stomach. The welts were faded now, still visible, but definitely faded. My tee had lifted during the night and was halfway up my torso. I blushed as I’d no underwear on, and I discovered Rock staring at the welts. Some of them would scar because they were so deep. Rock shifted on the bed and kissed each welt gently, and tears come to my eyes again. I moved my hand into Rock’s hair, and his head jerked up, and he looked into my eyes.“Carly, I’ll pay,” Rock said bizarrely, and I went stiff.“Pardon?” I asked sharply. Rock frowned.“I’ll pay for them to be removed; give you back your body.” I relaxed, and Rock looked at me, still puzzled.“Oh, I thought you meant….” I broke off blushing, and Rock shot me a grin. He was amused. Damn him, I just wanted to die in embarrassment.“Never paid for pussy before babe, as sweet as yours is, I’m not payin’ for yours either.”“I… yeah,” I whispered, embarrassed. Rock’s hand curved around my hip, and he laid his head on my stomach. I felt and heard a chuckle.“Babe, I’ll pay if you want them removed.”“I was thinking of having them tattooed over,” I said, and Rock glanced up and smiled. “I earned these Rock, protecting the old ladies, they mean something.” Rock scowled and when I flinched, smoothed it away.“That would be something. A couple of Hellfire do ink. Skilled ink. Can talk to them.” “Well, I’d need to think on designs and save money first,” I mumbled.“I’ll pay.”“No Rock, I’ll pay.”“You mine?” I nodded. “Then I’ll pay; I look after my woman. Carly, you’ll have what you need and want. And I’ll get what I need and want from you. But you gotta let me give you what you need and want. Not gonna fight you over it,” he said against my stomach. Rock twisted his head and dropped a kiss on my pubic bone. I stiffened, and then his head turned, and he kissed my stomach again. Rock shifted his weight and rolled me onto my stomach.Rock pulled the tee right up to my shoulders and stared at my naked back. I wriggled in embarrassment and tried to pull a sheet up. His big hand stopped me, and then I felt his lips kissing each welt and scar on my back, moving downwards to my ass and then my thighs.When he had finished kissing every wound, he drew himself up and wrapped his arms around me, enveloping me in his big body. It should have been threatening; it wasn’t. In this man’s arms, pain, hate and despair would never touch me again.",

      "title": "Chapter 11",
      "content": "Chapter Two.I woke the following day and, for the first time in months, felt safe. Rock hadn’t asked further questions and just been happy to hold me last night. Yet Rock wasn’t in bed this morning, and I wondered where he’d gone. A quick glance at the clock next to the bed showed six in the morning, which was too early for Rock to be awake. I knew Rock didn’t rise until eight, at least. There was a knock, and Blaze popped his head through. Worried green eyes raked my face, and Blaze winced.“Should’a come to me, Carly,” Blaze said, stepping inside Rock’s room.“No, I couldn’t go to anyone, Blaze, don’t you get it? I was kept captive, my father and brothers….” I broke off, unable to continue. Rock had explained I’d rambled during my delirium but not answered what I’d said. So it was hard to guess who knew what. Blaze’s eyes certainly made me think he knew something.“No, I don’t get it. Understand I ain’t your soulmate, but we’re close, right? That makes me your alternative, and you never once mentioned psychotic fuckin’ brothers or a fuckwad father. Shit Carly, what do you expect me to say? To feel?” Blaze demanded, and I guiltily glanced away from Blaze’s piercing gaze.“Blaze… shit’s not as easy as you think,” I muttered.“Fuck that Carly, shit’s easy, you say Blaze, my family are fucked in the head, and I ran away. Oh, the assholes might come looking for me, which means they’ll hurt me. What’s fuckin’ hard about that?” Blaze demanded, and I recognised guilt in his voice. Damnit, I didn’t want Blaze to feel guilty; he’d been a good and close friend ever since I landed at Made by Rage. When I just needed a shoulder, someone to sit there and be steady, Blaze was there. He called me his little sister, but I didn’t call Blaze a brother. To me, a brother was an insult. Blaze was my best friend.Best friends meant more than brothers, especially blood brothers. Blood could betray you, and that hurt. Blaze had proven himself a friend many times over and was ultra-protective too. My not telling Blaze had hurt him, and I felt guilt rise in my throat.“Do you want to know?” I asked, and Blaze frowned.“Will you need Rock? Man will fuckin’ go nuts if you don’t tell him,” Blaze growled. But the growl was without bite. It was a worried growl, not angry. Trust me, I understood the difference.“Yeah, I can tell you both together,” I murmured and bit my nails. Rock popped up behind Blaze, and I knew they’d set me up. I offered them both a stern glance, but neither showed an ounce of guilt. What was the betting Rock had risen early to grab Blaze? Rock sauntered into the room with jeans undone and hanging low on his waist. Damn him, I bit my nails for another reason now.“Start talking,” Rock demanded and shifted me over to sit behind me on the bed. I gingerly leaned back against him; the wounds hurt, but there was a lot of residual phantom pain.“The story starts with my mother; she wasn’t a redneck, as you’d call her. No, Mom’s parents were middle class, but Mom met and fell hard for my dad. Pa as he insisted on being called. Mom was beautiful but so sad. The life Mom was promised never materialised, and when I turned seven, Mom was worn out and beaten. But there was beauty in her still. I was the last child, meaning I’d four older brothers. Each of one a backward, crude hick,” I said and wrinkled my nose. No lie, I hated my brothers, hated what I came from. It was a typical hick story.“She died?” Rock asked as Blaze slid his back down against the door as he sat and listened. Despite Blaze’s easy-going pose, I guessed he was tense.“When I was eight, I swear they killed her. Mom was nothing better than a drudge, and she gave up. She had a heart attack, but I knew those assholes killed her by wearing Mom out. Mom did everything, washed, cleaned, ironed. She held a part-time job cleaning offices and would come home and start anew in our trailer. Pa had promised her a house, a garden, and when they married, he shoved Mom in a trailer and abused her. Pa was nothing but a stinking drunk,” I spat, hate in my voice. Rock squeezed gently as I trembled in his arms.“Shit, I’d not known how much Mom had protected me from them until she died. Then my life changed overnight. Mom wasn’t even buried before they dragged me from bed at six the following day and started me on her chores. I was eight, for fuck’s sake, a child, my Mom wasn’t even cold, and they forced me to clean house. For the next ten years, I was their slave; I missed so much school, people forgot I existed.My brothers are scum; they didn’t care I was a kid. Elrond is the eldest, followed by Barney and then Otis and Chester last. They brought women home, and I learned about sex long before I should have. Kids shouldn’t see what I’ve seen,” I said, my voice fading as memories threatened to overwhelm me.“Baby, you weren’t touched?” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“Not sexually, no, but Pa and my brothers didn’t hold back on beatings if they thought I needed it. For stupid shit, such as, if I didn’t get a beer quick enough, I got beaten, that type of stuff. Rock, I don’t want to dwell on it, but it was a terrible life. When I was eighteen, I discovered Otis had sold my virginity to a scumbag, and I fled. Ran as hard and fast as I could and landed here. Do you have any idea how heavenly Rage was? How Silvie’s and Lindsey’s kindness threw me? They treated me like a decent human being. I’d never once known that.But at the back of my mind, I’d knew they’d find me again; Otis had sold me and needed me. To be on the constant lookout is wearing, it’s tiring, and I sometimes just wanted to tell you everything and beg for protection,” I whispered.“Why didn’t you, Carly?” Blaze demanded.“Look around, Blaze, look at the trouble that finds Rage; I didn’t want to bring anything else down on the club. And my brothers are assholes who will shoot first and not care if women and children get hurt. That’s how they got me to return. They’ve got friends the same as them, they could rival Rage in numbers, and they’re psychotic and full of drugs, anger, and piss. Yeah, you guys would have won, but the women and children wouldn’t have,” I said sharply. Rock and Blaze had to understand that.“Assholes blackmailed you,” Rock grunted.“Yeah, Otis found me and watched. Then Otis and Barney stalked the old ladies. They threatened Silvie and Lindsey first, then mentioned Phoe and how much they’d enjoy fucking her. A classy lady dragged down and abused would be their idea of a wet dream. I’d no choice but to go with them.”“Always a choice,” Rock grumbled, and I shook my head. There hadn’t been an option to stay.“Not when it was the old ladies or me, I chose the old ladies,” I argued, and Rock grunted. “My brothers thought they’d get my money and stuff and were fuming when they realised I had nothing on me,” I explained.“That’s why you left your bank cards and cash here,” Blaze said, and I nodded.“That was the escape plan if they found me. But I underestimated them. I hadn’t expected them to stalk the old ladies and children. The truth was, it was Pa who wanted me back more than them. The bastard beat the shit out of me when they dragged me home. But my brothers didn’t care. Pa wanted the trailer cleaned, food on the table, my money. Yeah, Otis wanted me back to fulfil the promise to his friend, but the guy was inside doing time, so Hans wasn’t a threat.Whenever I got stronger, Pa or one of them would beat me down again. Because they needed to keep me weak to stop me from running. They chained me by the ankle to the dog’s shed at night, and I slept there. I didn’t see a bath or shower for months, I used to wash in the stream, but I kept planning. Pa was weak, too much booze, and he was dying. His death was just a matter of time. As soon as Pa began choking and dying, I watched. Damn, I wanted that asshole to know I was going to win. I told him I was. Told Pa I was returning here and getting my money and planning a good life.There was so much fuckin’ hatred in Pa’s eyes. Pa wanted to kill me and couldn’t; I sat there and told him everything I planned to do and watched the bastard die. And I didn’t go for help or try to help him. I did nothing but sit there and tell Pa pretty stories of how my life would be, despite him. Maybe you’ll look at me differently, but I won’t take that back. The pleasure I got from watching evil die is unsurpassed,” I whispered, and Blaze shook his head.“Was strong, honey,” Blaze muttered. Rock merely tightened his arms.“Babe, if you’d got that cunt help, I’d have spanked your ass,” Rock muttered, and I gave a weak smile.“As soon as the police had arrived and taken Pa away, I was gone. I’d already stolen the money from his wallet and raided his savings. First, I went north, selling his car on the way and then west to buy a new one. If my brothers followed, they’d think I was heading to Canada as I used to talk about it lots. Then I drove here; I didn’t realise how ill I was, but I kept going with Rage in mind. And yeah, I expected a chilly reception, but I needed to get my card and savings so I could start anew. And then I arrived here, home,” I said, and my hands clenched on Rock’s arms.“Trust me, you’re home,” Blaze said and didn’t even bother to look at Rock for an agreement.“Home,” I said wistfully, and Rock’s arms clenched around me. “My brothers may come looking. Otis still has to provide me to his scumbag friend. But I’ve realised something, they’d never have got close to the old ladies and children. The assholes played on my fears, but I forgot how strong Rage and their women are. Artemis would take them out in the blink of an eye, even if she was nine months pregnant and in labour. Ingrained fear of them allowed them to play me, and I fell for it.Was so stupid to believe they’d get close to Rage. They’d never get into HQ or reach the girls at Made by Rage. Sin always has Reid or Jett with her, and I was so damn idiotic. I let love blind me to the facts, love for the old ladies, and Otis screwed me right over. The marks on my back and legs are where they tried to break me and couldn’t.See, I’d tasted freedom; I understood there was a better life for me. Even if Rage turned against me when I returned, and I wouldn’t have blamed you, I was stronger because I’d known you. Discovering Made by Rage was the single best thing that ever happened to me. Otis and Elrond are uneducated, but they know how to scare people. Stupidly, I forgot that about them, I’ve been here two years and thought myself safe, and I forgot how vindictive they were,” I said. Blaze looked furious, beside himself with anger. I couldn’t see Rock, but I imagined his face was no better.“How did they find you?” Blaze gritted out.“That damned reporter who took a shot of Made by Rage workshop. He took it without me knowing he was doing so, and they saw it in an article. How the magazine ended up in their hands, who the hell knows,” I said.“Where do they live?” Rock asked.“They have a small trailer park hidden from the rangers in the middle of the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee. So easy to lose people there,” I replied.“Huh, I don’t get how an article on Made by Rage ended up in Tennessee,” Blaze murmured.“Neither do I, but it did, and they came for me,” I replied. “My family lived so far off the grid we could have been lost forever. The closest town was Gatlinburg, which was a couple of hours from where we lived,” I explained. After Mom’s death, my brothers and father had fled into the mountains, preferring not to have eyes on them.“What’s the possibility of them coming for you?” Rock grunted.“Fifty-fifty. Otis has spent the money he charged for me. The asshole he sold me to won’t settle for money. Hans will want me, and Otis will need to capture me. But I kept telling stories of how bad guys had tried to defeat you, and you kept beating them down. So that may give them pause for thought. And I also played on the strength of the relationship between Rage, Hawthorne and RCPD. Maybe I shouldn’t have come back, but I needed my cards and money,” I said sadly. The truth was, I may have brought even more trouble down on these wonderful men.Sure, most of the Rage brothers had grim, stern expressions and could be viewed as surly. But they’d go down shooting for anyone they cared about. Rage embodied the meaning of family; they didn’t care if you shared blood. They made family out of loyalty, honour and strength. Rage bled for each other, and if someone hurt, the others made sure they healed. Rage had been a completely foreign idea to me, people pulling together like they did. I’d never heard of such a thing, didn’t believe a concept like Rage existed.Family to me was harsh and cruel, unsupportive and abusive. A family that not only came together but worked together to ensure everyone’s happiness. Alien. Obviously, I’d not had much education, but Rage was above normal family standards from what I saw. At first, I’d been shocked by their actions. Silvie taking me into her home on the first day had knocked me for six. Lowrider, Drake, and Ace coming for me when Jumbo wanted to make me one of his whores. Who did that? No one in my book.Then I watched as Lowrider broke his back to win Lindsey and how Rage and their friends sought to keep her safe. I watched as Gunner treated Silvie so preciously and how torn he was between Autumn and Silvie. Men did not treat women as Rage did. Men slapped, pinched and abused. But not Rage. When one of them lost their temper, I was terrified and waited for fists to fly, but all they did was shout at their woman. Not once did I see a fist clench or raised to slap. And their woman shouted straight back without fear.Rage needed to be respected. While their women got into their faces, the women didn’t cross a certain line. Well, not unless your name was Artemis. No one could control her. Every man with an old lady cherished them, indulged their woman’s whims, took pride in their accomplishments. Again, that was something strange. I wondered why Rage did that, and slowly over time, I realised, because that is what love was. Boosting your other half to make them feel good. And I’d watched as the women did the same in return, making sure the men had silent support, cooking or buying favourite meals, just because. There wasn’t a reason; it was just because.And over time, I became one of the old ladies loosely; I’d taken the first step when I stabbed Lindsey’s ex-husband. I took the second step when I defended Silvie. But then I allowed my brothers to take that away, steal my identity and make me a drudge again. Stupidly, I’d caved and forgot the lessons Rage had taught, and although my body may be bruised and battered, my mind wasn’t. Actual strength came from within, the ability to withstand anything and walk-through fire.A movement made me glance up, and I stared as Drake lounged in the doorway. Drake’s face was impassive, but his eyes, as usual, were full of fire and emotion. Drake could control his face, but never his eyes. Brown eyes raked me from head to toe and then glanced at the silent man behind me and the second now sitting on my bed. Drake seemed to be seeking something, and when he found it, his eyes flared again.“About time you realised,” Drake muttered. Realised? “Carly, you’re stronger than you thought, stronger with us, and stronger with Rock behind you.”“Yes, I was stupid,” I said.“Yeah, tremendously.” Typical Drake, not mincing his words. “And see what stupidity brought. Woman, you should have come straight to us and let us protect you. As of now, Carly girl, you see hide or hair of those assholes, you shout and shout fucking loudly.” I frowned, puzzled; I thought the saying was hide nor hair, but Drake’s eyes dared me to challenge him.“Okay,” I replied.“Rock mentioned you might want your back tattooed over. Last I saw, it was a fuckin’ mess. Consequences Carly. What you did was damn brave, sacrificing yourself for the old ladies, but maybe now you realise that the sacrifice was unnecessary and fuckin’ stupid. Put yourself through hell for no reason. Whatever. Gotta let your wounds heal before we even look at tattooing. Scars may be too thick, and you might need surgery to remove the worst, and then we tattoo over it. Don’t jump before I say and don’t go running to another shop. We got people who do our tats right here in Rage, and Hellfire has a couple of talented artists,” Drake ordered.“Okay,” I said because there was no arguing with Drake when he laid the law down. Shit just wasn’t worth it.“Make sure Carly obeys,” Drake told Rock, who grunted with amusement. Blaze grinned as my head snapped up at the word obey. Irately, I pursed my lips, and Drake nodded in approval.“There she is, the fighter. We’re gonna keep prodding at you until you understand she’s there. We seen you strong Carly, we seen you quiet and reflective, need to see the fighter now.”“But I don’t like confrontations,” I said, and the three men threw their heads back in laughter.“Bullshit. What you call stabbing a man? What you call taking Silvie’s side. Fuck me, the girl don’t like confrontations,” Drake chuckled.“Might not like them, but you can handle them,” Blaze agreed, nodding. I wanted to bop him on the head, but Blaze would only bop me back. Blaze strongly believed in equal rights.“We got a fuckin’ party going on I don’t know about? Because if not, my woman’s screwing because she wants her girl in the workshop,” Lowrider said, appearing behind Drake. Lowrider’s mock glower warmed me; it was an expression I was very familiar with. Lowrider often used it when he was arguing with Lindsey, and she walked straight across his argument.“Rider,” Axel bellowed and clapped Lowrider on the back, and Lowrider stumbled forward a few steps.“Axel, for fuck’s sake,” Lowrider groused.“There she is. About time you got your fuckin’ head on straight. Now get out of bed; Lindsey’s screwing,” Axel boomed.“Just told Carly that,” Lowrider chuffed.“Well, Lindsey’s gonna have to wait. Carly needs shit,” Rock replied, and I glanced up.“I do?” I asked.“Where’s your clothes and shit?” Rock asked pointedly.“Oh,” I said. Rock was right; I needed stuff. My brothers had made me pack everything, and they’d sold most of it.“Thought so,” Rock grunted. Drake and Rock exchanged glances over my head.“I’ll pull Jett in to cover your shift at the bar, take Carly shopping,” Drake said. I shook my head.“Drake, I can wait for stuff,” I said, and Drake frowned, and I hushed.“The fuck you can, do as you’re told,” Drake said, and I nodded. If Drake told me to go shopping, then shopping it was.“Don’t think the challenger a good idea for Carly; I need a pickup,” Rock said, and Lowrider dragged a set of keys from his pocket. Deftly he threw them at Rock, who let go of me and caught them.“Take tonight too,” Drake said, and Rock nodded. Rock’s beard tickled my neck as he sank his head back into me. I raised a hand to cup his face, and Rock dropped a kiss on my palm.“Rider, go back to Lindsey before she dropkicks you for leaving her with the kids while she’s trying to feed the baby and work,” Drake ordered. Shit, I’d missed the births of Sin and Jett’s baby, Drake and Phoe’s, and Lindsey had also had hers. Deep guilt struck me, but I was also euphoric that they’d given birth safely and without stress.“The babies?” I asked, and Drake’s mouth twitched.“Sin and Jett have a little girl, Brooke. Lindsey gave birth to a boy, Elijah, and Phoe and I had a little girl, Peyton,” Drake said, his mouth softening.“So, who’s knocked up?” I asked bluntly, and Drake roared with laughter. Rock’s body shook behind me, and Blaze broke into a smile.“Marsha is again. Seems now they’ve dropped one set they’ve done it again,” Rock murmured.“Twins again?” I gasped.“Fuck no, Marsha will kill Fish. Just one. Gunner’s knocked Autumn up, and she’s cursing; that’s twins again. Silvie is due in the next couple of weeks. Artemis is knocked up again, and so is Sin,” Drake rattled their names off, and my eyes grew wide.“What is it with you brothers to keep knocking up your women?” I gasped.“Keeps us busy, makes baby boys for brothers and little girls for old ladies,” Drake grinned, and I chuckled.“Incest!” I spouted, and Drake looked horrified.“Not at all!” Blaze said, laughing. “Just creating the next generation of Rage.” My jaw dropped open, and I stared at Blaze in shock.“You claimed an old lady and knocked her up?” I gasped, and Rock began shaking harder at the expression that crossed Blaze’s face.“Fuck no,” Blaze denied, and Drake joined in, laughing. “Don’t know why you’re laughing after what Phoe pulled,” Blaze sniped, and Drake stopped laughing, and his expression darkened.“Should I ask?” I whispered, turning my head to Rock’s throat.“Phoe got sterilised, and Drake threw a shit fit to end all fits,” Rock murmured back.“Oh crap,” I whispered, and Rock squeezed me.“Drake wanted two more to make it an even twenty,” Rock replied.“Oh, they can adopt two more, surely?” I exclaimed, and Drake’s gaze shot to my face, and I bit my lip. Slowly, a wicked smile crossed Drake’s face, and I guessed I’d put my foot straight in it. Oops, so much for sister bonds. Phoe would kill me.“Sure can, sweetness, and on that note….” Drake strode away.“Damn, you’re in for it now. Phoe has threatened to cut the balls off a brother and cut an old lady if anyone suggested that to Drake,” Blaze said and shook his head. “Nice knowing ya.” Blaze strode from the room and left me with a chuckling Rock.“You’ll protect me?” I asked, teasing and Rock glanced at me.“Ain’t got kids, Carly, I need my balls to give you kids. Phoe’s sneaky; you’re on your own!” My mouth opened and closed, and I narrowed my eyes.“Kids?” I muttered, and Rock relaxed back against the pillows.“Give you a few months before springing them on ya, baby,” Rock said, supremely confident in his abilities to knock me up.“A few years is reasonable,” I quipped.“Don’t make me do a Jett,” Rock whispered and kissed the sensitive part of my throat. I blanched; the entire clubhouse knew what to do a Jett meant. Jett had chased Sin around, throwing away her birth control pills until she’d got pregnant. And it looks like Jett had succeeded again. I slapped Rock’s meaty thigh lightly.“Don’t make me do a Phoe; you know I’m capable of it,” I said, referring to cutting his balls off. Rock stiffened and then relaxed, laughing.“We’ll revisit this in a few months,” Rock teased. Yeah, sure we would.“I better get showered if we’re going out, I’ll need my bank card,” I said, but Rock hauled me back against him.“Carly, you understand what’s happening, babe? I’m claimin’ you?” Rock asked.“Yes,” I said.“That means, babe, I get to cherish and look after you. Now I can see that’s going to be a battle because it’s not something you’re used to. But you’ve seen how Rage treats their women; you’re not a stranger to seeing it. But you’re a stranger for it being aimed at you. Let me take care of you, Carly, and don’t fight me on this,” Rock asked, and I thought that over. Rock was right. No one had ever taken care of me since Mom died. I was used to being fiercely independent and surviving. Rock was offering more than survival; he was offering to protect and care for me.“Okay, I won’t fight you for now. But there’s stuff you need to understand, Rock. Like, I want to get an education; I can’t ever imagine leaving Made by Rage, but I want an education. Second, there’s no point buying lots of clothes today, you see how skinny I am? Pointless buying lots when I’m sure to regain the weight I lost. And I need a haircut please, Barney cut my hair with a pair of shears, and it’s a mess,” I said, pursing my lips. My long hair was gone. Barney had done a right number on my hair, and I hated it. Rock soothed me by brushing his hand over my throat.“Whatever you want, but Doc Paul said the best way for you to gain weight is to eat lots of small meals. Doc doesn’t think your stomach will cope with three enormous meals a day. Which means get showered and your ass dressed, and I can take you for breakfast at the Reading Nook,” Rock said and gave me a slight push. I laughed as Rock patted his stomach. Rock was always eating at the Reading Nook; the man loved Penny’s food and could eat six pastries in one sitting. Damn good job Rock worked construction with Apache.The two men owned a construction company, BlackRock, a play on Apache’s surname Blackelk and Rock’s name. The company was phenomenally successful, and I knew they employed many people. They had an office downtown but were rarely in it, preferring to be outside working with their hands. I honestly didn’t know how they managed, as they had to do a shift in the shop, one in the bar and a patrol each week.I showered quickly, wondering how Rock kept so many things balanced and realised many of the brothers had other jobs. Fish ran the garage as the manager, Gunner, rented houses and worked as a carpenter in the other part of Made by Rage. Slick ran a rental company leasing over twenty properties, Manny was the second carpenter in Made by Rage, and he and Gunner produced some stunning pieces. Ezra ran a landscaping company with Slate working with him and Mac co-ran the bar with someone from Hellfire. Lex managed the Rage Shop while Blaze and Hunter had just opened a gym when I left.Everyone else, from Drake to Lowrider, etcetera, worked in the garage. It didn’t matter whether they designed bikes (Jett, Texas, Lowrider and Calamity) or whether they painted and fixed them (Ace, Axel, Drake, Savage and Gauntlet). Although Gauntlet had recently taken over the part store from Blaze when Blaze opened the gym. The brothers had supported the new enterprise, and most visited the gym several times a week; having free membership meant they used it. And on top of the businesses Rage ran, as I said, they had a shift to do in the bar, Rage Shop and a patrol.Blaze had once taken me on a walk around at the gym, and I’d been amazed. It was set over two stories, the bottom being a sauna, hot tub and a large swimming pool with changing rooms. The upstairs held two rooms for classes and a vast area dedicated to working out. They had every piece of equipment one could think of having. That put a thought into my head.“Do you think Blaze will let me use the swimming pool if I get there early?” I asked, coming out of the tiny bathroom wrapped in a towel. Rock remained lying on the bed, eyes lazily taking me in with more than a hint of interest, and I blushed. I wasn’t used to Rock being so blatant in his perusal of me.“Yeah, Blaze won’t mind,” Rock said, sitting. “Come here.” I hesitated, unsure and taking courage; I walked across and stood in front of him. Rock’s hands gently reached out, and he dragged me into his lap. His hands cupped my face, and his mouth touched mine gently. It was searching, waiting for approval, and my hands slipped into his thick hair. Rock deepened the kiss a little, his lips gently on mine and his teeth nibbling my bottom lip. A finger traced the slender contour of my throat, and I gasped, and Rock took advantage, sliding inside my mouth. I’d kissed Rock before, and when I climbed him like a monkey, our kiss had turned wild.This was a different kiss. I sensed Rock didn’t want to hurt me but wanted me to know he desired me. His tongue gently danced with mine, and I tasted mint and coffee mixed together. Rock broke the kiss, and I gazed at him, speechless. Was that all I was getting? Rock chuckled at my expression.“Pout a little harder,” Rock said, so I did, and he leant forward and nibbled my lip again. “Ah baby, I love that bottom lip of yours.”“But you stopped kissing it quick enough,” I said sulkily, and Rock smiled.“Don’t have to rush shit; certain things need to be savoured,” Rock said. Really? He was going there?“Seriously,” I gasped. “I’ve watched you drag skanks off for a quickie lots of times, now you’re denying me?” Was Rock not attracted to me then? This made little sense, but I’d little experience with men and dating.“Sweetness, you ain’t no skank, and you’re my woman. You don’t get a wham-bam, and thank you, ma’am. Carly, you get the full works, the complete effort I’m planning to put in to make you mine. By the time I’ve finished, you won’t want anyone else but me by your side.”“Wham bam and thank you, ma’am, sounds pretty good right now,” I whispered mulishly, and Rock broke into laughter.“That sure does, but as my old lady and a damn virgin Carly, you deserve better. And that don’t mean losing your virginity in a fuckin’ clubhouse back room,” Rock said and dropped a kiss on my forehead. Damn, I just got told, and there was no budging Rock when he made a decision. Nuts! Rock hauled me gently to my feet, well aware of his own strength, and marched me from his room.“Rock, I’m not dressed!” I yelped, grabbing my towel tightly as Calamity stopped in the hallway and stared at me wide-eyed. Rock grimaced and let go, and I fled back into his room.“Not a word,” Rock warned Calamity, who grinned.“Nope, not one,” Calamity said and then fled down the hallway, yelling for Drake. Rock rolled his eyes and promised revenge on the Rage prospect.I found some clean leggings, a tee one of the old ladies must have bought, and a sports bra with underwear. I dragged them on before Rock got some other bright idea and slipped my feet into my battered and torn tennis shoes. Just once I glanced at the mirror and winced, I looked like a street waif, unfed and unkempt. My hair was the overall concern; it was such a mess. Barney had hacked at it out of spite. Searching through Rock’s drawers, I found a clean bandana and wrapped it around my head. That hid most of the ugliness, but not all. But I decided it was possible to venture out in public.Rock was waiting for me in the rec room. Or rather, he was chasing Calamity around the pool table with Slick and Ezra, looking on laughing. The prospect laughed cheekily and kept throwing quips at Rock, who threw some threats of his own back. I lifted an eyebrow and wondered what the problem was. Calamity spied me and focused Rock’s attention on me.“You and I ain’t done prospect,” Rock warned as he left the laughing prospect and headed towards me. “Just remember, you got training with me tonight.” Calamity groaned loudly as Slick began laughing instead.“Prospect, you don’t learn,” Slick shouted as Calamity hung his head. Rock reached for my arm and dragged me into his side.“Have fun,” Marsha called from somewhere, and I twisted my head around, trying to find her. A hand rose from behind the bar, and I called goodbye.“Get off your knee’s woman, Fish is in the office,” Rock called and hurried me out as Marsha’s head popped over the bar and glared. Rock rushed me out the door, laughing, and I shook my head. Marsha would get him back later; I had no doubt. This teasing was a new side to Rock, one I enjoyed.“First, let’s get something done with your hair. Because if I know you, and I know you, Carly, you won’t go shopping while it’s looking like that,” Rock grunted. I bit the inside of my cheek; I couldn’t imagine Rock on the inside of a hairdressers. But fuck, not only did Rock walk me to one around the corner to Rage, but he also entered the shop and waited while the hairdresser made a miracle out of my hair. The owner had served us straight away seeing Rock’s cut. Many of the hairdressers and customers kept glancing over at Rock as he hovered by the door, eyes firmly on me and what was happening to me.It was clear. If I got upset, Rock was ready to pounce and resolve any issue that upset me. Sadly, the hairdresser tutted as she ran her hands through my shorn locks and then showed me a few styles. I picked a cute bob and, feeling daring, chose a blue, lilac and pink streak to go through my hair at the front. Rock lifted his eyebrows but nodded an agreement.“Whatever my woman wants,” he drawled, and I swear every female, under sixty and over, just melted their panties. A couple of smiling looks were aimed in my direction, but others held the expressions of, ‘what the fuck is he doing with her?’ I shrugged them away, mainly because what the hell was Rock doing with me? There was no denying the mess I looked. I was terribly underweight to the point of looking anorexic, and my hair… well, that was self-evident.The hairdresser, older than me, squeezed my shoulder in reassurance, and I smiled. She couldn’t help what the customers were saying or thinking, and there was no point in making a scene to deny the truth. I was a mess at the moment, and Rock was smoking hot. The hairdresser grinned as she caught my lustful glance at Rock and bent down.“You know, I’ve been here thirty years; I know all the bad and good that hit Rage MC. And it’s wonderful to see that man over there looking happy,” the hairdresser whispered.Surprised, I glanced at Rock and saw he did look happy, content even. As if Rock’s plan for life was coming to fruition, and he could settle back and reap the glory of it. The harshness on Rock’s face had disappeared, and the lines around his eyes weren’t as pronounced, and it hit me hard. I’d given Rock the contentment and happiness on his face. By agreeing to be his woman, Rock needed nothing else from me, bar my word. Rock had claimed his woman, and she’d claimed him back, and in the world of Rage, once the claiming was done, everything else could happen in time.Which is why Rock wasn’t in a hurry to get me into bed; I guessed he meant to build up to it. Court me, I suppose, and in doing so, Rock would indeed glue us together. Like Lowrider had waited for Lindsey, Rock was prepared to wait for me because I’d given him my word I’d be his, and that was all Rock needed. The enlightenment must have shown on my face because the hairdresser began nodding, and Rock’s gaze was fixed firmly on me. Shyly, I smiled at Rock, and he replied with his own shit-eating grin.",

      "title": "Chapter 12",
      "content": "Chapter Three.I felt far better when we left the hair salon. My hair was now a sleek, pretty coloured bob, and I kept pulling the coloured strands forward to look at them. I don’t know what I’d expected, but the three colours were interwoven with each other, making it a rainbow in my hair. And I loved the effect, and Rock realised that and smiled smugly. Rock stopped me in the middle of the street and took a photo so I could see. Not as much fun as pulling the strands forward, but I appreciated the thought.“Carly, I miss your long hair,” Rock said, taking a strand and letting it slip through his fingers.“Then I’ll grow it back just for you,” I murmured, looking across at the clothing shops Rock had stopped nearby. These were high-end shops, and while I didn’t doubt they’d have clothes to fit me, I wasn’t a high maintenance girl.“Yeah, you do that, baby,” Rock said.“Look, can’t we go to Target or Walmart? I just need a few basics Rock, I’ll be gaining weight hopefully soon, so these clothes won’t last long,” I said, not wanting to enter the high priced shops.“True, but I want you to have a few pretty dresses, so when I take you out, you feel good,” Rock said, gazing into my eyes earnestly. Damn, how could anyone say no to those beautiful, begging eyes without being a wicked bitch? Humour and smugness glinted in Rock’s eyes, and I knew I’d been played.“Fine,” I huffed, but without any strength behind it.“Carly, will you be okay for a few minutes? I just need to pick something up, and I won’t be more than five minutes,” Rock asked, and I hesitated. No, I didn’t want to be alone. Fear of my brothers threatened to overwhelm me. Shivers ran down my spine, and goosebumps rose on my arms. Rock noticed immediately and sought to soothe me by stroking my back gently.“Yeah,” I muttered, and Rock shook his head.“Nah, I’ll walk you over and see you safely inside, and then run my task. Honest Carly, I won’t leave you for more than a few minutes. Find several dresses; I rarely saw your pretty legs and want to see them on our dates,” Rock said, and I wondered if I should swoon. Rock wanted to date me, court me. He wasn’t going in gung-ho like the other brothers. Maybe Rock realised I’d be frightened of that, as I’d been dominated far too long.Yeah, I wasn’t the only one who’d been assaulted or hurt. Phoe, Lindsey, and Sin had, too. Silvie had been badly injured when she’d been run over by a rival gang. At first, I thought my brothers had been behind Silvie being hurt and was so relieved they hadn’t been. The guilt of my best friend being run over because of me was more than I could have handled.The difference between Phoe, Sin, Silvie and me was, they’d had time to get over their abuse, or it happened when in their relationship. Which meant their men went out of the way to protect them while I’d dealt with the abuse alone.Lindsey had been in the middle of an abusive marriage when she’d fled to Rage. And while I’d come to her battles late, I’d seen first-hand how Lindsey had put herself back together and how Lowrider had supported her. With Rock’s support, I’d recover so I wouldn’t be afraid of my shadow. Rock squeezed my shoulder as we reached the shop entrance, and I gazed with trepidation at the posh interior.“A few minutes Carly, that’s it,” Rock said, and I nodded. Rock dropped a brief kiss on my lips to bolster my courage, and I watched as his long legs strode away. Cautiously, I pushed open the door and entered. Yeah, this was a lovely shop, with clean lines and eye-catching displays. The clothes were expensive and of high quality. Quietly, I began browsing, keeping my head low as I searched for dresses that would make Rock’s eyes pop. I found three in the first few minutes and checked for their smallest size, which I thought may still be too big for me. I saw two snooty saleswomen by a desk and moved closer, intending to ask where changing rooms were.“Like she can afford to buy anything here,” one girl sneered, her back to me. Her colleague was facing her and sneered, not seeing me behind a rack of clothing.“I’ll flip you for it; I don’t want to serve her either. Waste of time. She looks like she just escaped from a Nazi prison camp.” The second girl giggled, and I winced as the barb hit home. Tears filled my eyes. Even with my new haircut, I was still a mess. I looked at the three dresses and my hands clenched. Pretty clothing wouldn’t hide the ugliness.“Deal, loser gets to serve that, as I got better things to do with my time than wait on her. Why on earth does she think she can afford anything in here, doesn’t our shop scream couture and money? She’s more Target than couture.” My head sank to my chest. The girl was correct. My shame deepened as I heard them flip, and one of them cry out at losing. They began a battle over best out of three, and I stepped back into an extremely large, angrily vibrating body. Rock’s arms clamped around me, and I twisted and buried my head in Rock’s chest.“Oh,” one girl said, sounding stunned.“Where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock thundered, and I clung tighter to him.“What?” girl one asked, sounding stunned and a little afraid.“Said, where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock repeated as his hand stroked my back, at odds with his aggressive tone.“Hello, I’m here, can I help?” a woman said, hurrying over. I felt the heat of Rock’s glower, even though I couldn’t see it.“Your two cunts here just got your shop blacklisted. My girl came here to get a few dresses, and those two bitches were tearing her apart, saying she couldn’t afford to shop here. How the fuck do they know who my girl is? And then the bitches they are likened my woman to a prisoner in a concentration camp,” Rock said furiously.“Rock,” I whispered, and his hand pushed me into his chest harder.“I… I… don’t use language like that in my shop, sir. I can apologise for my salesgirls….”“No fuckin’ buts. Know who I am? Who I belong to? Yeah, and when Rage blacklists a business, it goes under damn quick. Rage just blacklisted you. And FYI bitches, my girl was kidnapped and held hostage for six months. Maybe Rage ought to teach you a lesson on how to look good when you’ve been held for six months,” Rock threatened, and the girls paled. One began crying as Rock took the three dresses from my hand and threw them on the floor. Growling unhappily, Rock pulled his phone from his back pocket and dialled a number.“Phoenix put the word out, A Touch of Class is blacklisted, just insulted Carly,” Rock growled. Phoe replied, and Rock said that I was okay. He hung up, holding the eyes of the manager and called Drake and repeated his message.“Next time before you bitches open your mouth, don’t fuckin’ judge a person,” Rock told them and escorted me out of the shop. The manager began yelling at the girls as we left, and Rock steered me away.“Are you going to blacklist that shop?” I asked as Rock steered me towards another shop.“Fuck yeah, and tonight those two bitches are gonna get the fright of their spoiled bitch life,” Rock said.“Rock, they learned their lesson,” I said placatingly.“Don’t give a fuck,” Rock answered back, and I let it drop. I recognised that tone. I’d heard it in most brothers when they’d made their minds up. “Phoe recommended this shop; it’s new and just opened,” Rock said and opened the door, guiding me inside it. A cheerful, beautifully dressed salesgirl came rushing over, smiling at us.“Hello, welcome to Maddison’s Magic. Can I just say, I love your hair!” she said, beaming at me.“Thank you,” I said, her words a balm to my wounded ego.“How may I help you?”“My girl needs jeans, leggings, and tops. And at least three nice dresses suitable for fine dining. Actually, make that five,” Rock mused with a frown. “She doesn’t want too much, Carly’s been through some shit and lost weight, but she’s putting it back on slowly. So treat her right, and we’ll return when she needs more clothes,” Rock warned, and the girl grinned.“I’m Maddy, the Maddison on the sign, and I don’t need to be warned to treat a customer correctly. Now sweetie, let’s find you some clothing that will expand for a couple of sizes as you gain weight. Then you get more wear out of them,” Maddy said, smiling. I liked this cheerful girl and her positive attitude. Maddy took me to a sofa, and I sat as she rummaged through her racks and brought me clothing. Happily, Maddy encouraged me to try on leggings and jeans, tutting when she thought something looked wrong and grinning when she thought it was perfect.To my surprise, Rock seemed perfectly at ease being in a dress shop, watching me try clothing on, and modelling it for him. I’d have been happy with a trip to Target. Rock sat in a chair and played with his phone, glancing up as I exited the changing room. Maddy jumped in before Rock did, agreeing or disagreeing with the clothing I was modelling. After two hours, I finally called quits. I was too tired to continue, and I wanted food and rest. Maddy cheerfully chatted to Rock, not put off by his grunts as she bagged up my purchases and then offered a five percent discount.I’ll give Maddy her due. She was a canny businesswoman. By offering Rock five percent, she guaranteed he’d bring me back. Rock had insisted I wear a pretty yellow dress he’d picked, and I’d a cardigan over it. He glanced outside and realised I needed a coat, and Maddy sprang into action, picking three for me. Rock paid for them and slipped the first over my arms like a gentleman would. It was a lovely camel colour in thick-lined wool, falling to my knees and with a wide tanned leather belt. Rock also picked up a hat, scarf, and gloves and paid for them at the same time. Once again, Maddy offered the discount.Rock led me to his Dodge Charger, threw the bags inside the trunk, and asked where I wanted to eat. To be honest, I didn’t care; I needed food as my stomach was cramping painfully. I’d be happy grabbing something at the Reading Nook. Instead, Rock drove to Bernard’s restaurant and parked at the back. As we got out, I realised I still wore my shoddy sneakers and stopped walking.“Baby?” Rock asked, seeing the concern on my face.“Rock my shoes,” I whispered. Rock dropped his gaze to my feet and stepped forward, and wrapped an arm around me tightly.“Let anyone dare comment, baby,” Rock said, trying to reassure me. Without a further argument, he steered me into Bernard’s and the man himself came hurrying towards us. After effusive greetings, Bernard led us to a cosy table in the corner. Rock took the chair next to the wall so he could see what was coming, and I appreciated it. Bernard offered us his special of the day, to which Rock agreed, and I sat there squirming. There was no doubt Bernard’s was fine dining. The people surrounding us confirmed that, as did the décor. But Bernard himself was down to earth and friendly.Of course, I’d met him several times when he’d come to the clubhouse with his husband, Stefan, who was a close friend of Phoe. But dining in his restaurant was an entirely different matter. This was the man’s business, and he intended to spoil us, judging by his reaction. Bernard brought our drinks and appetisers, and I tucked in straight away. Rock had ordered a variety of tapas. I could have inhaled them; I was so hungry.“So, what do you fancy doing next? Shall we go shoe shopping?” Rock asked.“Yeah, I need some as, unfortunately, my sneakers don’t go with the dresses. Perhaps a pair of new sneakers and a nice pair of shoes for the dress?” I suggested, and Rock took on a mulish look before nodding. He’d agreed too quickly, and I was suspicious. As a waitress cleared away our plates, Rock reached into his cut pocket and withdrew several jewellery boxes. I gazed at the four boxes as Rock pushed them in front of me.“What are they?” I asked.“Ordered them the day after you returned, and I knew the truth,” Rock grunted. He nudged one towards me with a long finger, and I picked it up. Excited, I untied the ribbon and flicked the lid open and made an O with my mouth. Inside was a gold chain with an oval-shaped pendant containing a diamond.“How pretty,” I said, gazing at it. Rock rose to his feet, reached for the box, took the necklace out, and fastened it around my neck. He dropped a kiss on my neck and sat back down, and shoved a second box at me. Cheekily smiling, I opened it and discovered a matching bracelet. The third box held matching earrings, and the fourth an anklet.“Didn’t get you a ring because I know it interferes with your work. Lindsey is always bitching her rings have caught on something,” Rock said.“I didn’t expect these,” I said, smiling happily. I loved presents, presents felt better than Rock buying me clothes because I was needy.“Carly, you expect nothing,” Rock teased. Bernard approached with our mains. Rock had ordered the surf and turf platter, which with Bernard’s flourish meant two T-Bone steaks, lobster in a shell, crab, and king prawns. Added to that feast was calamari with a 16 oz gammon steak, ribs and a butterfly chicken breast. There was a large basket of fries and another containing garlic bread, and a third with garlic breaded mushrooms. A waitress brought dipping sauces. My eyes widened in horror at the amount of food, and Bernard laughed.“Enjoy!” Bernard chortled and disappeared.“Where do we start?” I asked, lost in the aromas floating from the platter. Rock pulled two plates towards him, cut the chicken breast in half, and did the same with the ribs and steak. Next, he added fries and sides and shoved a plate towards me.“Are you claiming the lobster?” I teased, and Rock winked. He cracked the shell open and scooped a forkful of the meat out, and held it out to me. I leaned forward and went to take the fork, and Rock moved it away. Then, with a wicked glint in his eyes, Rock offered the fork again, and this time when I leant forward, Rock placed the fork in my mouth. My eyes watered in pleasure. The lobster was succulent and delicious. Wow, Bernard could undoubtedly cook! As we ate, we chatted about Rock’s work and halfway through, I sat back and rubbed my stomach.“Damn, I’m full,” I muttered. Rock glanced at me dubiously, so I nodded to confirm my words. “Please finish; it would be a shame to waste the food; it was so wonderful.” Rock didn’t need telling twice, and finally, the platters were clean, and Rock sat back with a satisfied grunt. He patted his belly and grinned at me.“That’s earned you an extra half an hour at the gym,” I teased, and Rock chuckled.“Fuckin’ worth it, princess, man I could eat here every day,” Rock said.“The food was amazing; it’s the first time I’ve ever eaten here,” I said, and Rock nodded.“Rapid City got some great restaurants, but Bernard’s is most definitely the best. Hate to be one of those fuckers who have to book or take a risk on getting a table, love the fact we can get a table whenever we want. Change of subject, Carly, you ever been to Mount Rushmore?” I blinked at the abrupt change of topic.“No,” I said.“Was thinking we could ride tomorrow, take in the sights?” Rock suggested, and I beamed at him. Then my face fell.“I have to start working again soon,” I said.“Lindsey has put you back on the books already, honey. You’re on sick leave.” Rock grinned at me as a waitress cleared our plates, and Bernard hurried over with dessert. My eyes widened greedily at the plate of mini cheesecakes, two of each.“I think I just made room for dessert,” I giggled, and Rock grinned.“Babe, you always had a sweet tooth,” Rock teased.“Can’t deny that.” I smiled and scooped a bite of a chocolate cheesecake. I moaned in pure bliss, and Rock chuckled again.“So ride tomorrow?” Rock asked around bites.“Well, I shouldn’t let Lindsey pay me sick pay when I can work tomorrow,” I demurred, and Rock scowled.“Carly, you’re not going back to work until you put on at least twenty-four pounds. Girl, you look like a strong wind will blow you over. Lindsey’s in agreement. While she and Silvie are desperate to have you back, you’ve been through hell and need to fuckin’ heal a little. Lindsey said if you set foot over the shop’s threshold before a month’s over, she’ll fire you,” Rock grinned smugly, and I rolled my eyes.“Seriously? And what am I meant to do for money? My savings are just that, savings. I don’t want to break into them,” I muttered without heat.“What ya need money for?” Rock asked curiously as he scooped another bite of cheesecake.“Well, things, women’s things, clothes, food, somewhere to live,” I said, puzzled.“Let’s get this straight now; you keep missing the point, Carly,” Rock said sternly, and I glanced up, surprised at his tone. “If you want anything, I’ll buy it; you need to go to the shops for lady shit, you take my card, want to buy clothing, you take my card. As for a house, I got a place we can live, ain’t anything as grand as the others but I think you’ll like it. Needs furnishing, though, so you’ll….”“Take your card,” I interrupted. Rock offered a nod as I shook my head.“Please meet me halfway. Rock, I am not and never have been someone who lives off another person’s wallet. I work to afford nice things and had goals. But I won’t live off of you, Rock; I have pride,” I said. Rock grimaced.“Every woman has this argument, and I feel for my brothers now. Except for Drake, his wife is so fuckin’ rich, Drake has little choice,” Rock complained. I hid a smirk; Rock wasn’t wrong on that. “Look, I get you want to work, that’s admirable, but understand me as well. I ain’t a sissified wimp of a man; I’m a man who claims a woman and looks after her. So you keep your money for girlie shit but agree to say once a month you take my card and go apeshit on it. I pay bills and everything else, and your money buys your clothes and shit, can we agree?” Rock grumbled, sounding peeved. These men hated being told no.“Yes, we can agree on that,” I said happily, pleased I didn’t have to battle Rock for what he thought was his rights. Rock sent me a sly glance.“As we’re on our one agreed to blow it on my card day, let’s go shoe shopping because those dainty little feet of yours won’t put on weight,” Rock said, smirking. My nose twitched, and I knew he had me bang to rights, and I’d just walked straight into his trap. Smugly Rock paid the bill and led me from the restaurant.◆◆◆ “Bitch! I hate you, I need new shoes,” Lindsey cursed as she held up the blue velvet Jimmy Choo’s Rock had bought me.“Wowie!” Phoe squealed and hurried across. “Hot damn, Rock must have dropped a wad on these!” Phoe exclaimed.“Why can’t you be my shoe size?” Silvie whined, holding up a pair of gold strappy high-heeled sandals and glowering at me. I shrugged as she gazed at Apache, who was watching her, and he winced.“You can’t have the same shoes as Carly, or you’ll bitch,” Apache warned and turned his back. Silvie flipped him the finger and cooed at the matching bag for the sandals.“I need to go shopping,” Lindsey whined, gazing at Lowrider. Lowrider gazed calmly back.“Woman, how much did you drop on those shoes yesterday?” Lowrider asked.“Not a lot,” Lindsey muttered. Lowrider lifted an eyebrow, and Lindsey pursed her lips. “Okay, I dropped three thousand on them,” she muttered.“And the other pair?” Lowrider asked.“Three thousand again,” Lindsey said mulishly, and I was grinning outright.“What’s your monthly budget for shoes?” Lowrider asked, and I caught Apache smothering a smile.“Five thousand.” Lindsey made eyes at Lowrider.“So stop your bitching about needing more shoes. I ain’t making you take a thousand off next month’s budget… yet,” Lowrider said and turned back to his beer. Lindsey paled at the thought of her beloved shoe budget being downsized and poked her tongue out at Lowrider. Phoe and I cried with laughter.“What if Lindsey gets shoes as a gift?” Phoe called, and Lowrider turned and sent Phoe a stern glance. Phoe was well known to love to spoil people, and I saw Lowrider click onto her meaning.“Do I need to talk to Drake about your budget?” Lowrider asked, and Phoe shrugged.“Bleh, as if Drake would stop me. All I got to do is walk naked into our bedroom wearing a pair of heels, and Drake won’t argue.” Phoe grinned. Lowrider groaned and rubbed his forehead.“Fuck Phoe, I don’t need that image!” Lowrider cursed and turned his back. Drake broke out laughing, and Phoe grinned triumphantly. I liked pretty shoes but didn’t understand the need to hoard them like the others did. Lindsey, Phoe, and Silvie boasted a closet just for their shoes.“Holy shit, I need a pair like this. Did they do them in other colours?” Marsha exclaimed, holding up a pair of satin peep-toes.“Yes,” I said.“Fish!” Marsha roared, and I saw Fish roll his eyes.“Tomorrow, baby, Windfell may need to stock up after our girl cleared them out,” Fish called back.“See, Fish doesn’t set Marsha a limit,” Lindsey complained, making doe eyes at Lowrider.“Marsha don’t want a new pair of shoes every day,” Lowrider retorted, and Lindsey gave up arguing. Each old lady shopped at Windfells frequently. The shop was privately owned and was prominently placed in downtown Rapid City. When staff spied the old ladies coming, they knew they were onto a fantastic day, not just in sales but tips too. Their eyes had burst out of their head as Rock had dropped enough money to feed an army for a year.“Did Rock clear them out of everything?” Sin asked, strolling across her eyes wide. She gazed at the mass of boxes piled around us.“Enough that he had to call Klutz for a meet to collect them,” I said, laughing. Klutz had been good-natured about using his truck to ship my shoes back. I’d have been happy with one or two pairs, but Rock thought shoes linked to kinky sex. And after he told me that in an aside, I stopped arguing. Mainly because I had the image of Rock hot and sweaty, and kinky sex meant good things.“You look happy baby, those shadows in your eyes have gone,” Marsha said, peering into my face. She came in close, and I fought the urge to poke her in the eye. I hated people in my face.“Rock,” I said, and that one word explained it all. I stole a glance at him, legs splayed, sitting on a stool with a beer in hand. He was leaning forward, talking to Slick, who was nodding and motioning with his hands. A warmth settled in my belly, and I recognised it for what it was, love, acceptance and comfort, the sense and feeling of home.“Rock was foul, you know, these last six months,” Phoe said, nodding at Rock. Turning to her, I frowned.“He was?” I asked, and Silvie nodded vigorously.“Rock was awful, he’s never been verbose, but he became mute and downright snarly. It started the day you left.” Lindsey looked uncomfortable. “Rock had been watching you and was waiting for you to grow into your skin, and then he planned to make a move. That kiss you gave him and the scene that followed after in Made by Rage, Rock knew it was time to lay claim. Then you up and disappeared… shush, I know you didn’t plan to, girl.” Lindsey cut off what I was going to say.“Sorry,” I muttered.“We know what you did for us Carly, but we didn’t expect you to sacrifice yourself. None of us had a clue why you ran and we were all hurt. Carly, don’t you ever sacrifice yourself like that again,” Phoe scolded.“My brothers made it seem there wasn’t a choice,” I said and glanced away. Lindsey picked up on my awkwardness.“Rock saw his chance at getting everything he wanted, and then your asshole brothers snatched it from him. He was nasty, his darkness welled up and shit; I thought we were going to lose him like they lost Ace. Rock became monotone and evil, ready for a fight at the slightest insult, and there was a good few fights. That man was a walking hair-trigger temper,” Lindsey said.“Drake couldn’t reach him, and nor could Lex, and that was worrying because Rock and Lex are close. Lex tried, but Rock shut him down every time. He’d arrive at work with Apache, do his shifts here and hang around, but Rock wasn’t present,” Phoe said, and I heard the worry in her voice.“Yeah, Rock shut down; I think he thought he wasn’t entitled to beauty,” Silvie agreed. Guilt welled up, and I swallowed it back. That had been my fault. Rock hadn’t thought he was worthy when, in fact, it was me who wasn’t worthy of the man. I was nothing but trailer trash, and it was hard to understand why Rock wanted me.“Rock’s always been one of the silent brothers, solid and dependable. Guess he saw his dreams disappearing down the plughole and shut down,” Marsha said. “Which goes to show just how much Rock cares about you, girl.”“I’ve guessed that. Rock wants nothing more than to smother me in cotton wool and keep me by his side,” I said. Drake’s phone pinged, and moments later, he rose to his feet, Rock, Apache, Klutz and Slick behind him.“Stay inside,” Drake ordered, and we nodded. Moments later, Ellen hurried in, looking flustered with Texas’s daughter Rosie and Axel’s daughter Willow behind her.“I am FBI,” Willow was declaring loudly and looking mad.“Drake says get your ass inside, you get your ass inside,” Ellen said firmly and crossed her arms, glancing at the two young women. Axel’s woman wasn’t going to be moved, I noted. I’d only met Ellen once and wasn’t sure of the older woman. Lindsey and Silvie had been full of glee when they told me Axel had found his one, and Ellen seemed like a nice lady. She certainly held her own against the enormous mountain of a man by all reports.“Drake is not FBI,” Willow said mulishly. Phoe rolled her eyes.“Nope, but he’s your uncle, and you’ll do as you’re told!” Phoe said, and Willow frowned.“Don’t even think of arguing,” Marsha said, backing Phoe.“Christ, you can’t wrap me up in cotton wool forever!” Willow said and stormed across the room to the bar. Oh, I knew that feeling; I sympathised with the pretty woman who was glowering at the door and fingering the weapon she had strapped to her waist. From what I’d learned, Willow was fully capable of looking after herself after being undercover for many years. A cover so good that Axel had written Willow off as a lost cause.“Shopping Ellen?” Marsha asked as Ellen strolled across to us.“Yes, I thought I’d treat the girls to a manicure and pedicure day. Nailing Willow’s feet to the floor long enough to do so is a miracle. And even then, she wouldn’t leave her badge and weapon behind,” Ellen sighed and sank into an armchair. Willow sent Ellen a smug look.“Well, Willow was always more business than girlie girl,” Marsha agreed, and I smirked. Marsha waggled a finger at me; I liked the sound of Willow.“You’re just as bad, Carly; you can’t sit still,” Lindsey teased, and I nodded happily. Seriously, how boring was it to sit in a chair while people touched your feet? Urgh, no!“You will learn to enjoy them,” Silvie threatened, and I rolled my eyes at her.“What’s going on, anyway?” Sin asked as she slipped her shoes off and wriggled her toes.“You know Blaze keeps feeling watched? Autumn saw that guy once, but every so often, Blaze gets the feeling again?” Everyone nodded at Rosie as she sat. “I caught sight of a bike parked behind a truck, and his visor was firmly focused in Blake’s direction on the forecourt. So I texted Uncle Drake, and we got thrown in here.” Rosie sighed as Willow frowned.“How long has Blaze been sensing that?” Willow asked, scooting closer.“Not frequently, but for over a year now, Willow. Whoever it is, just watches. They haven’t approached Blaze or anything, so it’s strange. Blaze has no idea who it is, but it bothers him,” I said and jumped as bike pipes roared loudly, and I heard at least three bikes speed away. Drake entered with Calamity on his heels, who walked behind the bar and took over from where Klutz had been serving. Calamity leaned back against the wall behind the bar and gazed at Rosie, and sent her a wink. Marsha’s mouth dropped open as her gaze flicked between the two of them. Rosie poked her tongue out, and I shook my head as Calamity sent her a badass biker look.“Don’t you dare go there without your father’s approval,” Marsha warned, and Rosie scowled.“Dad doesn’t run my life; I run his!” Rosie muttered.“Your father will string Calamity up by his balls should he make a move on you without permission. It’s sacrilege to even consider making a move on a brother’s daughter without their fathers’ permission!” Silvie warned Rosie.“It’s just fun, we’re flirting, but I have to finish university first. I’ve a year left, and then I’m a qualified vet. Ain’t going to let nothing stand in the way of that Aunt Silvie,” Rosie demurred, but I saw the heat in the following glance she sent Calamity.“Oh boy,” Sin muttered. From the looks I saw on the other women’s faces, oh boy, was right. Texas was well known to be an overprotective father, and Rosie had been one of Rage’s few children. So she’d been overindulged and loved her entire life. And smothered… the brothers had been overly protective of Rosie, and she hadn’t been able to break free of their shackles until she went away to college. Even then, Texas tried to keep Rosie local, but she broke free and wandered off to attend university.“Get Penny on your side,” I muttered to Rosie, who grinned.“Not a bad idea,” Rosie muttered back. “Calamity’s still filling out, but you can see the brother he’s going to be.” Rosie was right, Calamity when he’d first arrived, had been a scrawny kid, the same age as me near enough and had been mistreated his entire life. Calamity got neck deep into trouble and came seeking a home and found Rage. The prospect had been taken on as a candidate, which progressed to prospect earlier than expected when he’d saved Silvie’s life from a serial killer.Calamity was taller than when he arrived, hitting six foot three now. He’d gained weight and muscle and was a good-looking man. Calamity was the cheerful one, nothing fazed him, and he’d a ready smile and cheerful manner. He was at odds with most of the brothers, who preferred stern and blank expressions. Even though he was rabidly friendly, Calamity was pretty close to Klutz, and they often sat chin-wagging in a corner.“They’re voting tonight,” Phoe said suddenly, and we glanced at her. “I heard Drake on the phone.“Huh?” Marsha asked.“On the candidates, so if anyone has any qualms about them, you better speak up, and I’ll drop a word in Drake’s ear,” Phoe said, looking around the gaggle of old ladies.“None here,” Sin said, relaxing back. Silvie moaned and rubbed her protruding stomach.“How much longer?” I asked. Silvie glowered and poked at her stomach.“Five weeks. These kids are in a damn hurry to escape,” she muttered.“I can’t believe Jett knocked me up again so quickly,” Sin groused, but her eyes belayed her happiness. And speak of the devil. Jett walked in carrying their two little girls, Amelia and Brooke. Amelia was on her feet and heading towards Uncle Drake before anyone could blink. Amelia completely loved Drake and him, her. Well, Drake loved all the kids. Drake swooped and swept Amelia up, tickling her under her chin as Jett made his way to Sin. Shit, that man was gorgeous, not as much as Rock but Jett had it going on.“Who else is pregnant?” I asked as Jett handed Brooke over to Sin for a feed. Sin pulled a blanket around her, and Brooke and I glanced away, giving them privacy. Drake had told me, but I wondered if any of the old ladies were keeping secrets.“Marsha three months, Artemis two months with one child this time, thank god, she’d have ripped Ace’s dick off if they had a third set of twins,” Phoe said, and I chuckled. Artemis was fully capable of doing so. “Autumn’s six months pregnant, with twins.”“Damn, how many sets of twins?” I gasped, and Phoe shrugged.“Given up counting, guess when you have Ace and Apache around, and Autumn, who have the genetics for twins, then we’re going to be drowned in them,” she replied.“How on earth did they get knocked up so quickly after their last pregnancies?” I asked, pointing at Marsha and Sin.“Think you know the answer to that,” Marsha hissed, and I blushed.“Wait till Rock gets it in his head he wants babies, see how long you keep your birth control pills for,” Sin said and pursed her lips. I laughed. Sin and Jett’s ongoing battle over her birth control pills had been hysterical.“And Fish says now we’re making babies, we gonna keep making them,” Marsha groused. “He don’t know three is all he’s getting; I’m getting on in age.”“Thirty-eight isn’t old; you keep giving me grandbabies; that’s your duty,” Ellen teased Marsha, whose mouth dropped open.“Seriously, you’re giving me shit? Adopt some of your own!” Marsha hit back, and Ellen threw her head back and laughed.“No way. Axel and I get to return them at the end of the day. Ain’t so stupid to tie ourselves down,” she said.“So you make the rest of us your baby-making machines?” I asked, and Ellen turned an innocent gaze on me.“Why Carly, of course!” she said, and Phoe laughed hysterically.“That’s funny shit!” Silvie said and patted her stomach as one twin kicked her hard. Yeah, it was funny shit, but the humour faded when I considered having Rock’s kids. Cute little boys that looked like their father. Oh yeah, that would be something.",

      "content": "Chapter Four.“Several things to discuss,” Drake stated without preamble, as church opened that night. His brothers stared at him. They thought they’d come for a vote on the candidates.“We still got the vote,” Drake said, confirming. “Then got issues with Blaze, Santos, Dark Souls of Lucifer, and finally Phoe and Carly.” Rock’s head snapped up at the mention of Carly.“Let’s get the vote out of the way,” Ace said, nodding, his eyes flicking to the three candidates outside the inner sanctum. It took less than ten minutes for the brothers to vote. “The three are unanimous votes for prospect,” Fish stated, and Drake nodded. “Call them in here.” Fish pulled out three prospect patches for the front of their cuts and then three longer ones that went on the bottom on their cut at the back.Unlike many MC’s, Rage had candidates for a year to see if the potential prospects would fit in with the club’s ideals. Rage having once gone bad, Drake, Texas, and Fish had brought this in to ensure the club’s safety. They’d kicked three candidates, one of which had been a serial killer, leaving Rage with Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage.Every candidate did a year before being voted to prospect; once prospect, they faced two to three years before becoming a brother. Yes, it was long-winded, but if you stuck it out, it meant you were what Rage was seeking. Not like the old days where Bulldog took possibilities straight in as brothers without a vote or trial period. It was one way of keeping Rage clean.Drake watched Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage enter. Of the three men, only Klutz showed nerves. Drake understood how much the club meant to Klutz and was glad the man had received clean votes. If one brother had declined, the candidate would have had one more year to prove himself and would be gone should he fail the vote again.“Grats the three of you. Welcome to prospect. Sit and be welcome in your first time in church,” Drake said. A huge grin broke out onto Klutz’s face while Savage nodded his head in acknowledgement, and Gauntlet offered a small smile and nod to everyone.“First order of business, Blaze. Ya know that Blaze every so often feels he’s being watched. Earlier, Rosie caught someone watching. Rock, Klutz and Slick gave chase,” Drake said and nodded to Rock.“Fucker was on a Yamaha, fled as soon as we pulled out. Chased him for a while and lost him around the Sioux San Hospital. The asshole was quick off the mark, and we got held up by a fucking ambo pulling out. By the time we cleared it, asshole was gone,” Rock growled.“What you need?” Slate asked Blaze. They’d been prospects together. Drake found those that who were prospects together were incredibly loyal to one another. Their bond was stronger.“We ain’t got a sense of threat yet, but don’t like Blaze being alone,” Texas said, glancing over at Blaze.“Yeah, I feel something bad aimed at me, but not a threat. Don’t know, man, hard to explain. Without evidence, don’t want to jump the gun,” Blaze said.“Keep our eyes open and see if this fucker returns and if so, take action?” Lex suggested, and next to him, Ezra nodded.“We ain’t got nothing else to act on, so yeah, streets are silent, no one knows who’s watching Blaze. Or if Blaze has an enemy outside of Rage, which again we got nothing,” Ace said.“First sign of something wrong, you call for backup, Blaze and make sure you’re carrying at all times. Have you got a concealed licence?” Apache asked.“Yeah,” Blaze grunted. He didn’t appear outwardly worried, but Drake knew his brother was. This had been happening for a year, and no one had any idea why.“Blaze, you feel threatened, hole up and call, you hear me, boy?” Axel threatened, and Blaze said yeah again.“Santos has been seen outside Spearfish, Chance’s territory. Hellfire’s now got feelers out,” Ace said, and backs stiffened across the room. Santos owed Rage, and they planned to get their due.“Just a sighting?” Gunner asked, and Drake nodded. Gunner’s woman, Autumn, had been the last victim of Santos, and Gunner was fit to burn for the man.“Yeah, him getting in a car. Snitch saw Santos and informed Chance. Could be why we ain’t found hide or hair of him here,” Drake replied.“Will let James know,” Gunner said, and Drake nodded.“Better it comes from you. Washington has a claim as good as ours to the man, and he’s burning for blood. Rage gets Santos, Washington needs to know,” Drake said, and everyone nodded. James Washington, Gunner’s brother, had lost his closest friend, Frank, a man he called brother to Santos. Washington wanted blood and wanted it yesterday.“Autumn and I will take a ride to James tomorrow morning,” Gunner said.“Keep James informed and make sure Washington knows that goes both ways. Man may be trying to get clean, but he doesn’t act without Rage. Santos owes us too,” Drake said.“James knows,” Gunner replied.“Inglorious has heard that Dark Souls of Lucifer have reformed. The gang scattered after that shit with Silvie, but they’re hiding out again with a new Prez. Like Santos, we can’t fuckin’ trace them, but, we know now, they are working for the cunt,” Texas said, and faces gazed at him.“Tell me you’re fuckin’ joking?” Slick demanded.“Wish I could say I was brother,” Texas replied.“Santos has recruited a biker gang to hunt us? Is the man completely off his rocker?” Mac laughed.“Don’t he get how much firepower Rage can bring to the game should it go us against a gang?” Manny asked.“Why a biker gang, though?” Gauntlet asked, and everyone turned to him. “Seems distraction to me.”“Carry on,” Drake encouraged.“We’re chasing our tails, looking for the pricks. Meanwhile, Santos is getting time to get back on his feet after the showdown with Washington. Santos lost a shit load of men, so he needs time to recruit. Means we’re chasing shadows while Santos builds his strength back up,” Gauntlet explained.“Shit,” Mac growled, “crafty fucker.”“Well, we knew Santos wouldn’t go without a fight,” Manny said, and Lowrider nodded.“Yeah, and could this shit with Blaze be a distraction, too? Rage is chasing shadows with nothing concrete,” Hunter asked, and Drake sat back.“May be onto something. Rage is distracted, looking into shadows for threats when there ain’t none. And Santos is gaining time to do what he needs, and with us distracted, our attention is elsewhere,” Axel boomed.“And add to the fact Santos knows we’ll move to protect women and children, maybe we should be asking if any of them have felt watched?” Jett suggested. Every brother with an old lady suffered a sudden chill in their stomach.“All well and good us finding and claiming, but the women are at risk too,” Slate pointed out.“Fuck,” Apache groaned.“Nah, if one of those women had bad feelings, you’d know about it. They learned their lessons, ignoring Frenzy. A fuckin’ hard lesson,” Manny said, and his face tightened. Sin had been one of the women who’d felt threatened but felt unable to bring it to a brother. She may be Jett’s woman, but she was close to Manny.“That be true,” Texas said.“The kids? Would they bring it to us?” Mac pointed out.“Elder kids, yeah, anyone over ten would. Those below probably not, although fear may manifest in other ways. But Santos knows, our kids get touched, we’ll burn his family. Don’t believe the asshole is that stupid,” Lowrider said.“No? Santos handed his own father over to Rage for the sake of money,” Ace pointed out, and every brother at the table blanched.“Santos won’t touch the kids. He’s got a thing for kids being abused, asshole may traffic women, but we know Santos don’t hold with abusing them,” Lowrider said.“Wanna understand how the fuck that works,” Apache growled. “Asshole sells women who get raped and abused. But Santos don’t hold with abusing them?”“Not a single woman is ever harmed in his hands; once he’s sold them, it ain’t down to him. Or so he thinks,” Lowrider said. Lindsey had spoken of her conversation with Santos when she’d been kidnapped by him.“Spineless cunt,” Rock spat fury in his voice.“Ain’t arguing there,” Fish said.“Make sure all kids over ten understand if they feel someone watching or feel unsafe, talk to a brother. And we’ll get the old ladies to monitor the under tens. Provide a safe place for the kids to talk,” Drake said, thinking of his brood of kids. Fuck, his daughter Peyton was only a few months old, Phoe having given birth in June. And Drake would burn the city for her.“Ain’t much else we can do, can’t put a guard on every kid,” Axel said. “Keep the over tens and old ladies alert. Someone tries to take one of their kids; there’ll be a bullet in the asshole’s brain before he can say fuck me. Gotta agree, don’t think the kids are at risk, maybe Santos will take a run at the women, but they can handle it. Need to trust them.” Axel spoke the bitter truth, and Drake swallowed it harshly.Drake didn’t like it. Rage had too many potential victims, and Drake suddenly regretted that brothers were making families. Family had been a dream of his for years, and yet now it caused headaches. Then Drake shoved it aside ruthlessly. Yeah, they had potential victims, but life couldn’t be ruled by fear. One of theirs had already been snatched, Jett’s Amelia, and they’d saved her and would again should another child be taken. Drake had to trust in his brothers and in his close circle. The moment Drake started doubting their ability to protect what was theirs was the moment Santos won.“Onto Phoe. Woman’s organising a charity bike run between the local towns, want us to plan a route and get our associates involved. Phoe wants the Road Captain to carry a flame of hope and raise money. She’s got Stefan setting up a website for donations but wants brothers to collect on route.” Drake said, swapping his mind to his wife.“Done, I’ll organise with the other clubs; you got enough shit to deal with,” Ace said, stepping up to the plate. While Drake was not only Prez but Road Captain, Ace knew he’d a lot on his plate. “Can get old ladies and friends stationed every so far apart on the route and the older kids to collect with buckets.”“Phoe’s doing a big advertising theme in South Dakota, so should pull crowds. Stefan’s organising a big fair at Founders Park, so the route will end there. Ace get with Phoe and see what she needs and then organise it with Stefan. Don’t let that crazy fuck talk you into theme dresses or similar shit,” Drake warned, and a few smiles cracked around the table. It was well known that Phoe’s Director of Fundraising was nuts.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Hawthorne sent Davies up to check her brothers. Two’s missing,” Drake said, and Rock stiffened. Rock’s gaze shot to the rec room where Carly was curled next to Silvie on a sofa with her hand on Silvie’s belly.“Don’t tell her,” Rock warned.“You don’t tell her, my girl don’t see shit coming, she’ll get hurt,” Blaze said and held Rock’s eyes. Rock wavered.“My girl,” Rock snarled back.“Our girl, she needs to know, so she’s prepared. Carly ain’t weak, and if she’s not warned, she makes herself a target,” Blaze argued. Drake rolled his eyes; this would carry on all night. Rock would want to protect his girl, and Blaze would want her warned.“As Prez, it’s my decision. Carly gets told Rock, girl can handle herself,” Drake muttered, thinking back to Carly stabbing Lindsey’s ex-husband with a pair of shears.“Drake…” Rock argued.“No, the last thing Carly wants is to walk down the street unaware danger is lurking. Her brothers can grab Carly because she’s not paying attention, girl’s not looking. Makes Carly an easy target,” Drake said and sliced the air with his hand. Rock burned with fury for a few moments and then sank into his chair.“Carly’s just starting to heal,” Rock said.“Carly will continue to heal, but she can be alert, too. Maybe they ain’t coming for her. Who the fuck knows? Davies is tracking them, when he finds them, we’ll know, but it’s an order, Rock, tell Carly,” Drake said firmly, and Rock gave up ungracefully.◆◆◆ Rock left the inner sanctum and came straight to me. My bags and boxes had been loaded up in Jett’s pick up on Sin’s orders. Sin was determined to make his life hell as he’d knocked her up again so quickly. She winked and smiled sweetly as she held Brooke in her arms as Jett came out and glanced at her to reassure himself she was okay.“Jett’s going to blow,” I whispered, and Sin smiled smugly.“Jett shouldn’t keep knocking me up then,” Sin said. “Here, hold Brooke while I tell Jett he needs to take your shit to Rock’s place.” I looked up, surprised, as Sin dumped Brooke into my arms, and I held her close and gently touched her cheek. She was beautiful, with her father’s black hair and her mother’s blue eyes. Brooke daintily yawned and closed her eyes. Rock sat on the arm of my chair as I heard Jett curse.“Was you in on that?” Rock chuckled as he reached out a finger and stroked Brooke’s hair. Jett’s voice rose loudly. Brooke’s eyes flew open, and the tiny baby stared at Rock before offering a smile and closing her eyes again.“No, I told Sin not to,” I denied, and Rock chuckled. One muscled arm slid around my shoulders, and the second cupped my arm, holding Brooke.“Suits you,” Rock whispered in my ear, and my eyes flew to his and dropped at the heat in them. Jett stormed up and held his hand out, and Rock, smirking, placed a set of keys in his hand.“Just dump it in the front room,” Rock smirked, and Jett shot him a dirty look.“Ain’t a prospect, brother,” Jett said and strode away. Insult showed in every line of his body, and Blaze and Slate jeered at him. As Jett passed, both his fists shot out, and he punched each brother before leaving. Texas was howling with laughter as Slate rubbed his jaw and Blaze his eye.“Idiots won’t learn that Jett can hit with both fists,” Rock grunted and shifted me so he could seat me on his lap. I flinched and checked to see if Brooke had woken, but she was snoring gently in my arms.“Nope,” I agreed.“Darlin’, two of your brothers are missing. Hawthorne is chasing them. No need to worry but be alert,” Rock said as my body stiffened.“Are they coming for me?” I asked.“Not that we’re aware of, but Drake had Hawthorne following up to make sure you were safe. Once we track them, we’ll handle it if they’re in Rapid City,” Rock reassured me. “Want you armed, Carly; know you can shoot, so you need to be armed.”“Okay,” I said, not knowing if I could shoot one of my brothers. Then again, they’d chained me like a dog, sold my virginity, beaten and whipped me. Yeah, I could shoot those bastards.“Carly, you okay?” Rock asked, dipping his head to mine.“Of course. At least I know to be aware of them. If they come at me here, they’ll bleed,” I said firmly. Rock’s mouth twisted.“Wasn’t going to tell you, but Drake ordered it,” Rock muttered.“That would have been foolish. I fear them and what they’re capable of. But if I didn’t know they might come for me, they’d have caught me off guard, and I’d have been an easy target. Now I know those assholes are coming, and I can take measures to protect myself. Pepper spray, taser, knife, and gun. Hey, fancy shopping tomorrow?” I asked, and Rock pulled his head back.“Shit, you get excited at buying weapons, but not clothing and shoes?” Rock chuckled.“Well, yeah,” I giggled, and he shook his head.“Carly Lennon, you have hidden depths, woman.” Rock glanced up as Klutz called out for who wanted takeout. Rock called out a no, and I pouted; I was hungry.“We’re gonna hand this little lady back to her momma, and we’re going home. We’ll pick food up on the way,” Rock said as he caught Sin’s eye. She hurried over and took Brooke from me, and I called out goodbye as Rock and I left the clubhouse.“Let me guess, we’re getting tacos,” I teased. It was a well-known fact that Rock adored tacos. If takeout was on offer, Rock constantly voted for them. Rock sent me a cheeky grin, and I rolled my eyes.“Already ordered them, being delivered in half an hour,” Rock said, and I smiled. He walked over to his bike and swung up onto it, and gazed at me. “What you waiting for? Come on, Carly, time to ride.” If I needed confirmation that Rock was serious about us, this was it.Rage had a policy that no woman rode behind them unless they were their old lady. Not even bunnies one of the brothers might date, rode behind them. Other bikers may not care who rode behind them, but for Rage, it was a statement, only an old lady. Happily, I scurried over and, placing my foot on the footrest, I swung up behind Rock and shunted forward. I wrapped my arms around him and leaned my head on Rock’s back.“Get you a helmet tomorrow,” Rock grunted and throttled his bike. “Hold on tight, Carly.”Shit, I was overwhelmed when Rock hit the road on his Harley Davidson Breakout. The bike vibrated beneath me, and I felt the power in the machine creep into my bones. Riding like this was so freeing, relaxing and I felt one with the bike. Rock expertly steered us through the streets, his exhaust roaring as the sound bounced off buildings. He took me towards the outskirts of the city and turned down Nameless Cave Road.Rock approached a high electric gate and pressed a button on his bike, and the gate swung open, and Rock whizzed past. From what I remembered, several of his brothers weren’t far from here. I found it amusing that they congregated within twenty minutes of each other. For Rage, it wasn’t enough they met up at the clubhouse. Their bonds were so tight they had to live close to each other as well. With a backwards glance, I saw the gate swinging shut behind us, and Rock rode the bike up a well-maintained road and pulled up in front of a house.Whatever I’d been expecting, it wasn’t this. It was a two-storey house that had been extended a lot. The original was made of stone and had cute circular windows and an entrance set in the middle. Above that was another set of doors with a balcony overlooking the stunning countryside. To the right was a double extension, the bottom half was brick, and the top half was wood framed. And to the left was a stone and wood extension with a balcony running the entire length and disappearing around the corner. This held large windows while the other extension had smaller windows. A slate roof capped it off.“House ain’t much, was my grandparents. Think it was my great-great-great granddaddy who built the original, and then my great-grandparents added the first wing,” Rock said, pointing to the right-hand side extension. “My grandparents added the left-hand wing and the extensions out back.” I thoroughly disagreed with Rock’s version of it ain’t much. Despite its colossal size, I loved it already. The right-hand side held a porch with a giant swing and a small wrought iron table, and two chairs.I swung off the bike, and Rock followed suit. The surrounding area was overgrown, but I thought I saw remains of flower beds, and I could swear there was a pond near the house. Rock strolled towards the house and opened the door, and I flew up the two steps behind him and entered a massive room. The house was barely furnished, just an armchair and sideboard, but the room was amazing. It was painted cream and showed its beams in the walls and ceilings, and it opened straight into the roof that held two skylights, flooding the room with sunlight. I was practically vibrating in excitement, wishing to explore.“Off you go,” Rock said, giving me a gentle push. I didn’t hesitate and flew through the first door to the right. Excited, I entered another vast room with a sofa and a large screen tv. There was a black rug thrown on the floor, but nothing else. The walls were exposed brick and wood panelling, and I fell in love with the massive stone fireplace opposite the entrance. Glancing to my left, I spied two French doors and peeking through, I saw they led to a bright glass and wood sunroom.My mind busy making plans; I returned to the first room and saw several doors; I opened the one opposite the front door and found a downstairs cloakroom. The door next to that led to a small hallway, and striding down it, I discovered a snug that again was empty. I raced back out and went through the first door on the left and found Rock’s study. It was a disaster, so I quickly closed the door. The second door on the left led into the left wing, and I walked through what I thought was the dining room. There was a door at the back, but I ignored it for now and continued into the following room.This held a matching fireplace to the room in the right extension and had the plaster cut away, exposing beams. The room was completely empty, and I spied a door at the back and walked through it. This led to a set of three small rooms whose use I’d no idea, and then I discovered the kitchen and nearly sank to my knees and cried. In front of me was a masterpiece of a country farmhouse kitchen, and my eyes gazed greedily at the huge eight hob range cooker with bespoke hand-crafted cabinets. I trailed my hand over the Welsh dresser that had undoubtedly been crafted just for this kitchen.Behind me was another door, and on opening it, I discovered an additional four rooms. One was a utility, one a pantry, the third a cloakroom, and the fourth I was unsure of. This was empty but had a table and a large window with shelves on the walls and empty jars. Moonshine? Jams? I would have to ask Rock.The Welsh dresser was set into the middle of the wall, and there was a door next to it which further exploration showed it led back to the dining room. The kitchen had a dining table sat at one end, a small scruffy thing at odds with the beauty of the kitchen. Behind that was a glass wall with a door set into it. That led me back to the sunroom on the right-hand side. One part of the kitchen ceiling was glass, letting the sunlight in, while the other part was exposed beams and peering outside; I could see the balcony continued round the back of the house.Puzzled that I hadn’t found any stairs, I wandered back to the first room where I discovered a hidden door, cleverly cut into the wall and opening it I found them. I jogged up them and encountered a long landing. Heading to the far-right-hand side, I opened the doors into two bedrooms of decent size and a family bathroom before wandering back to the old part. A door opened into the master bedroom, and I shut the door because I didn’t want to invade Rock’s privacy until asked to.The left-hand side held another three bedrooms and a further bathroom. At the end of the left-hand side was another flight of stairs, and scrambling up them, I found a converted wide-open space just sitting unused. My mind scrambled for what it could be used for as I wandered back downstairs to find Rock.“Why is there no furniture?” I asked Rock when I entered the kitchen.“When my grandparents died, the house needed a mass of repairs. BlackRock was just taking off, so I let things lapse even further. A year ago, I started working on this and moved everything into storage. You’re welcome to go through it, baby, and see what you like. Grandma had good taste, but it might not be yours,” Rock said as he made sandwiches.“The house is beautiful,” I said, pulling out a stool at the breakfast bar.“Redecorated it with you in mind,” Rock said and shocked me speechless. “What? There was never a moment I wouldn’t claim you, Carly, just wanted you to spread your wings a bit. You were always mine, girl, nothing more to say,” Rock said and placed a sandwich in front of me. I ignored it as I considered his words. For a few moments, I allowed them to sink deep into my bones as I realised what Rock was saying. He’d cared for me longer than I thought, even more than I’d believed. Rock had decorated his grandparent’s home with me in mind, and I understood his reason. Rock had desired to give me a home.“Shit,” I muttered as tears snuck into my eyes. Rock had seen the real me, the one who desired a home and love. Not the scrappy shy thing I usually was, but the lost, lonely girl who wanted nothing more than to be accepted and wanted. Rock had seen more than I thought, considering I kept my past secret and tightly guarded.“Don’t stress it,” Rock said, placing a hand over mine and dropping a kiss on my forehead.“Bit hard not to, you did this for me, and I have nothing to offer you,” I said, leaning back against his hard body.“You offer me redemption, a chance at beauty, love and family. Don’t got family Carly, except my Rage brothers and kids. My blood family turned against me a long time ago, all apart from my grandparents,” Rock said, sitting, but his gaze was unfocused, lost in the past.“Are they dead?” I asked gently.“My grandparents, yes. My family no. Mom, Dad, two sisters and a brother, various aunts and uncles and cousins, are still alive. But I didn’t fit in, see, they’re rich and well to do, and I’m me. Money meant shit to me; family and a good moral compass meant more. They didn’t understand that I couldn’t get on with their fancy friends and suck up the bullshit they do,” Rock said.“Would I have heard of them?” I asked, and Rock grunted and smiled bitterly.“Am pretty damn sure you would have. My father is the Governor of Virginia,” Rock said and waited.“No way, your father is Mitchell Johnson?” I said, gasping. Mitchell Johnson was constantly in the papers pushing one agenda or another. The family were old money and elitist, from what I read.“Yeah, my name is Heath Johnson. And I was the black sheep of the family. Was kicked out to make my own way at eighteen when I rebelled and refused to follow my father into law and politics. Even worse, they’d made fuckin’ arrangements with a friend of his for me to marry his daughter when I finished college. Who the fuck does that? I was disowned and left to make my own way. So I’ve made my own way, and BlackRock Construction is doing fuckin’ well, and we lead the way in green housing,” Rock said proudly.“You are?” I asked, trying to assimilate the information.“Yeah, we are, and we’ve taken on new teams for out-of-state projects. We’re the biggest construction company in South Dakota now that deals with turning commercial buildings into housing. We also reclaim old, abandoned sites and clean them up and put affordable housing on them,” Rock said proudly.“That’s wonderful, and I imagine your family knows nothing about this?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope, not from me. I bet they got eyes on me, though,” Rock mused.“Isn’t your father going to be running for vice president?” I asked, and Rock nodded.“Yeah, which is why I wouldn’t be surprised if they had eyes on me. Can’t have my skeletons crawling out of the closet while Daddy Dearest is running his campaign. Wouldn’t surprise me if they know what I’m doing, and they try to draw me back into the fold,” Rock said and bit into his sandwich.“What will you do if they try?” I asked curiously.“Tell them to go to fuckin’ hell. Fuckers ain’t wanted me for over half my life, so fuck ‘em all. Mitchell and his family ain’t mine. They threw me away, out into the cold and if not for my mother’s parents, who’d have known what might have become of me. My grandparents were simple people. Fuck knows how they raised my mother. But they had family money, and they left it to me alongside the house. Helped me start BlackRock Construction with Apache.”“Then it’s good you had them,” I said with a small smile and took a bite of my sandwich. Flavours exploded in my mouth, and my eyes widened. “This is s’great,” I mumbled around my mouthful.“Just a basic sandwich, baby. Yeah, my grandparents were the best. They despised what my mother turned into, a snobby rich bitch who forgot the fundamentals my grandparents taught her. My sister’s married well-to-do assholes and my brother married the woman I was supposed to. None of them appear happy marriages. My grandparents weren’t even invited because they were classed as small-town hicks. Can you imagine disrespecting your parents like that?”“Not if they were good parents, no,” I agreed. Rock’s face took on an apologetic expression.“Sorry, baby,” he said.“No, don’t be. My mom did her best, but she was tired when I was born. Your grandparents sound amazing, and I wish I could have met them,” I said, smiling.“Carly, they’d have loved you,” Rock said with his own bittersweet smile.“I’m sure the feeling would have been mutual.”“Well, whatever, my mother challenged their will after grandpa died, and she couldn’t overturn it. All the money my father has, and the bitch wanted the money from my grandparents. Greed breeds greed,” Rock said bitterly.“And she didn’t like it that everything was left to you?” I suggested.“Exactly, that was the first time I’d heard from her in years, and it was to be served paperwork they were challenging the will. My siblings were insulted that they hadn’t been given a fair share. When the judge heard how my grandparents had been treated and the fact they’d tied the will up tightly, he threw it out and made them pay costs. Called them greedy to their faces,” Rock chuckled.“I bet that went down like a ton of bricks!” I exclaimed.“And then some,” Rock laughed. I enjoyed hearing him laugh. Rock was usually grim and silent. Rock was openly verbose with me, and he laughed and chuckled more easily. I wondered who else had ever seen this side of him because from my memories, even with Rage, Rock was tight-lipped.“They don’t matter, Rock; you have a family and a good one,” I said, seeking to reassure him.“Yeah, and they and you are all that matters,” Rock said firmly, and I winked at him as he smiled happily.",

      "title": "Chapter 14",
      "content": "Chapter Five.“What ya think ya doing, bitch?” an angry voice snarled, and I spun around, horrified. There was no mistaking that voice, and I gazed into the ruddy face and blurry weak blue eyes of Barney. He was filthy, his beard matted, and his clothes smelt of smoke and booze.“Go away, Barney,” I said, my shoulders straightening. Barney stepped towards me, and I glanced around, seeking help.Two weeks had passed since I’d moved into Rock’s, and life had been heavenly. Rock hadn’t yet made a move to consummate our relationship, but there had been lots of heavy petting and exploring. Still, Rock was sticking to his guns on dating. I’d returned to work this week after allowing Lindsey to pay me two weeks of sick pay. And I’d gained enough weight that Rock was happy for me to return to Made by Rage.The past few weeks had been filled with long bike rides and picnics. We’d been to several restaurants, although we returned to Bernard’s as our favourite. But reality bit. Rock had to run BlackRock Construction, and I needed to earn a wage. Shyly, I’d reacquainted myself with the new girls, Addison and Paisley, and settled back into my role as Lindsey’s main helper. Lindsey had been over the moon to welcome me back. Between us, we decided as there were five of us, we’d take one day each a week to fetch lunch and snacks. Today was Wednesday, and my turn to bring lunch. I was carrying a box with food orders for the girls and Gunner, who was in his part of Made by Rage. Plus, Slick and Gauntlet, who was in the shop today.“Ya need to come home, sister,” Barney sneered, and I gazed at him. Barney’s beer belly stretched his dirty white wife-beater, and the red and black plaid shirt didn’t fasten. His jeans sagged around his waist and were ripped, although not by design.“No, I am home Barney, get lost. No way will I return to that hellhole and suffer what you did to me,” I said as I searched for a brother or someone I knew. Barney’s lip curled, and he reached out a hand and grasped me firmly.“Didn’t even wait around with decency for Pa’s funeral. Stole Pa’s car and ran off ya cunt,” Barney snarled. I stiffened as Barney’s hand tightened and knew I’d have bruises.“Want the truth?” I sneered. “I watched Dad die and didn’t save him.” Barney’s mouth flopped open, and his breath was rank and his teeth even more rotten.“Carly, you fuckin’ bitch, he was our Pa,” Barney snarled, and I shook my head.“No, he beat the shit out of me. He was no father of mine. Now fuck off, Barney, you can’t control me anymore with threats against my friends. Rage knows everything, and if you touch their women, they’ll slice you up one piece at a time,” I said. My eyes landed on Barney’s beat-up truck, and I was well aware of the danger.But even as fear rose, so did the knowledge that Rock would come for me. Barney backhanded me, and I blinked dazed and dropped the box with the food in. Anger flared, and my hand curled into a claw, and I went for him. This time I wouldn’t go meekly. Screeching, I raked my nails across Barney’s face, gouging his eyes. Barney backhanded me a second time, and I cried out. A couple of women across the street called out, and Barney began dragging me towards the beat-up truck.A hard body slammed into me, and I went down, curled into someone’s arms, and my head bounced off a hard chest. Dazed, I blinked and peered into a pair of blue eyes I didn’t recognise. Unsure whether to struggle, I glanced across as the sounds of someone throwing punches hit me. Twisting my head, I saw Dylan Hawthorne punching Barney and Barney falling to his knees. Dylan held Barney by his wife-beater as he drew his arm back again and again.“Hey, I’m Davies,” the man under me grunted somewhat cheekily, and I tried to sit up as Blaze yelled my name and ran towards me. Davies kept his arms tight around me as he belly crunched and sat upright, leaving me sat between his legs.“Carly!” Blaze yelled a second time.“There’s another in the truck,” Davies called back, and Blaze skidded to a halt, and his furious gaze turned in the direction of the roaring truck. Briefly, I caught a quick glimpse of Otis, before he pulled out into traffic. Cars screeched and swerved to avoid him. Dylan held a barely conscious Barney in one grip with a frown on his face. Sirens echoed in the distance, and I guessed the police were on their way.“Go, run,” I hissed at Dylan, who stared at me, amused.“Nuh huh, shit’s okay Carly, how you doing?” Dylan asked as a black and white skidded around the corner.“Dylan, you’ll get arrested,” I whispered as two cops got out of the car.“Hey man, hear you stopped a kidnapping,” one called, and I stared stumped as Dylan turned and winked at me.“Yeah, this is Carly Lennon, girl’s Rage. This asshole backhanded her twice and was trying to get Carly in his truck. Asshole’s been reported to Ramirez for holding Carly hostage for six months,” Dylan said, and my head twisted as I stared at him. Oh dear, I hadn’t spoken to Ramirez. Realising I was still sitting on the ground, I tried to get up, and Dylan reached out and hauled me to my feet. Davies gave a sigh of relief.“I’ll get Drake,” Davies said and leapt to his feet in a smooth move I envied. Davies jogged away as Blaze hauled me into his arms and wrapped me up tightly.“Dude, I’ll call Ramirez,” one cop said and pulled a phone from his pocket. He stepped to one side as his partner hauled Barney to his knees and handcuffed him.“We’ll need statements,” the officer said.“Yeah, no probs. Those three women were watching. Maybe they’ll give a statement too,” Dylan said, tilting his head.“Ramirez said arrest him on attempted kidnapping, and he’s on his way. I’ll talk to the witnesses,” the second officer said, returning.“Yeah, I bet you will,” the first officer said, grinning as the younger man scurried over to the women, who were quite attractive. Dylan rolled his eyes at the older cop, who rolled his right back at him.“Kids,” the older officer said and shoved Barney into the back of the black and white. The cop glanced over as Lowrider came full pelt around the forecourt corner. Anxious eyes checked me over, and Lowrider glanced at Made by Rage, where his wife worked. Lindsey and everyone else was plastered to the front windows, with Gunner firmly planted in front of the door, preventing them from leaving. Drake arrived from behind Lowrider, and his eyes took in the scene.“You clear?” Drake asked Dylan, who nodded.“Yeah, all good. Got one of Carly’s brothers, the other fled. Davies had eyes on them, and when they moved in this direction, Davies called for backup. I was closest.” Drake peered into the cop car and snorted at the bloody and bruised face that stared back.“Seems he met some trouble,” Drake commented and strolled over and ran a hand over my face. “Rock’s gonna kill someone.”“But I’m okay. I scratched his eyes,” I said, not wanting Drake to think I was weak. Drake turned to me and cocked an eyebrow.“Yeah, I can see, honey; we’ll have to remind Rock about those talons of yours. Shit, I’d hate to see my brother scratched up because he stole your chocolate,” Drake drawled, and I glowed. That was high praise from Drake.I watched as Dylan and Davies gave brief statements and promised to come to the station to provide more detailed ones. The younger cop trotted back, a blinding grin on his face, and I knew he’d scored. He informed Ramirez that he’d the names and addresses of the three young women who were gazing at him from under their eyelashes. Ramirez rolled his eyes and sent the younger cop to escort Barney to the station. I broke free from Blaze’s arms and tugged on Ramirez’s jacket sleeve. He cocked his head and looked at me.“A word? In private?” I asked, and a slight frown crossed Ramirez’s face. He stepped to one side, and I went with him.“What’s up Carly,” he asked.“Tonio, I think Dylan may have made a mistake. He told the older officer that I’d given a statement concerning being held hostage for six months,” I said, worried. Nervously, I nibbled my bottom lip. Ramirez’s brown eyes softened and understanding crossed his face.“Honey, you know when you were sick? Well, you rambled, and Rock filmed it. From that, I put together a brief statement, and all it needs is your signature. It’s been documented, and an alert is out for your brothers. Rock wanted to give you time before coming down and making a more detailed one. Doc Paul has given a comprehensive statement of your injuries and health when you arrived at Rage. Dylan wasn’t wrong. There’re warrants out for your brothers,” Ramirez explained. My eyes narrowed at Blaze, who glanced away after shamelessly eavesdropping on my conversation.“There’s already been a report?” I asked.“Yeah, honey. Seriously, Carly, you didn’t think you’d return to Rage in the condition you did, and everything would be dropped?” Ramirez asked, surprised.“No, Tonio, I just wish Rock had told me and not treated me like an invalid by keeping me in the dark,” I replied. Blaze’s mouth twitched, and I thought he was annoyed.“No need to worry, Carly, you’ll need to come to the station later, bring food. You’re going to be there several hours, giving a statement about how they treated you and another about today,” Ramirez said, and I laughed.“In other words, you need feeding,” I said, and Ramirez nodded. Blaze walked over and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.“Man, I’d like to get Carly inside before Lindsey and Silvie tear Gunner apart,” Blaze said, and Ramirez glanced across at Made by Rage and winced. I turned and saw Lindsey and Silvie, both firmly planted in front of the window, with arms crossed and matching glares on their faces. Thankfully, the glares were aimed at the men stopping them from getting to me.“Ah shit, I dropped our lunches,” I hissed angrily. Blaze swooped and picked up the box.“Food’s intact, Carly, so let’s get inside,” Blaze said with a nod from Ramirez. “I’ll get Rock to bring Carly this afternoon. Let the women fuss, or you’ll be swamped with old ladies at the station.” Ramirez winced and nodded.“Sure thing, we’ll be booking Lennon, anyway. Which brother was it?”“Barney, Otis was in the truck that screeched out of here,” I replied.“We’ll get an APB out on it; we might catch him,” Ramirez said, and Blaze walked me away. Gunner stepped back from the door, and Lindsey nearly yanked it off its hinges in her haste to get to me.“Are you okay?” Lindsey screeched, and I winced and nodded.“A couple of bruises, but yeah, I’m fine, so stop stressing,” I said as Lindsey dragged me inside and began patting me over. I weakly batted at her hands and gave up as I recognised how determined Lindsey was to make sure I was okay. No sooner had she stopped then Silvie was there, jerking my face one way and another and then checking me over too. Meekly I stood and let them reassure themselves I wasn’t badly hurt, although my face felt swollen.“Sit, I’ll make coffee,” Silvie ordered.“Blaze has lunch,” I said as Lindsey pushed me through the wooden barriers that separated the reception from the workshop.“Good, we’ll feed you up, and I’ll call Sin and place another order to be dropped off. If you’re going to the station, no doubt Ramirez and Ben will want food,” Lindsey replied.Paisley hovered nearby as Addison sorted through the packages in the box and carried Slicks and Gauntlets. Gunner remained by the door, so Paisley handed him his order and Gunner hooked Silvie’s chair and sat behind her desk. Blaze turned the sign to closed and tapped on his phone. Fifteen minutes later, Reid, Sin’s brother, knocked on the door and handed a bag through to Blaze. Blaze grunted thanks, and Reid checked me over and left. No doubt reporting back to Sin.I spent the next fifteen minutes reassuring everyone I was okay. Please just let me eat, I silently begged because to ignore Penny’s food was a crime. Half an hour after Barney had first grabbed me, Rock’s bike thundered down the street and skidded to a halt in front of the shop. He swung off it, his body tight, and stomped into the shop. As soon as Rock appeared, Gunner and Blaze disappeared.“Okay?” Rock grunted, his eyes taking in the scene. I was sitting in my armchair with Lindsey next to me in hers. Silvie perched on the arm of mine, holding ice to my face, and Paisley was sat opposite me. Addison was squatting on the arm of Lindsey’s chair, and I was surrounded by clucky hens. Helplessly I made big eyes at Rock, begging him for help.“Yeah, I’m okay,” I said as Rock’s gaze landed on my swollen and now bruised cheek and split lip. I’d not discovered that until I bit into my sandwich.“Ramirez said to bring you as soon as you’re ready. Your asshole brother is at the hospital. Carly, you did damage to his right eye, girl,” Rock said with more than a hint of pride.“Good,” I muttered.“Mind if I have my woman?” Rock asked, sensing that the women were more than ready to defend me from any perceived threat. Even against Rock. They swapped glances as I hid a grin, and I shoved my way up and launched myself into Rock’s arms.“Rock, I stood up to Barney; instead of giving in, I attacked,” I cried as Rock’s arms wrapped around me tightly. One large hand rubbed my back and soothed me.“Baby, you did good. You didn’t let Barney get you in the truck, and you stopped him long enough for help to reach you. Hawthorne says you were like a lioness,” Rock murmured. I puffed up with pride. I loved hearing that. Several revelations had hit me once I got back to the shop.The first was my brothers may hurt me, but I could hurt them right back. Barney being at the hospital proved that. Second, although I’d felt fear, I hadn’t been paralysed by it, not like when they’d held me for six months. The third was that I was willing to fight to keep my life as it was. I’d every right to be happy and make my own decisions. My brothers didn’t have the right to deny me those choices. They may try to, but they couldn’t if I was ready to fight. Finally, I had pride in my actions. Pride had been beaten out of me, and I thought it was gone. But I was proud of my efforts standing up to them. They were nothing but nasty, evil bullies.“Carly?” Rock muttered as my emotions flittered across my face.“Honestly, I’m okay, Rock,” I said and snuggled into his chest. Rock squeezed me tighter and relaxed his arms, and I drew in his musky, spicy scent and let his love warm me.“Fuck, my heart skipped a fuckin’ beat when Blaze called. Good job, Dylan had got you,” Rock muttered.“I thought Dylan was going to kill Barney,” I said and shuddered. Not because of the dark thought of Barney being killed. I was ambivalent about Barney’s death and considered it a possible blessing. But the idea of Dylan being charged with murder horrified me.“Nah, the man has control, but Hawthorne enjoyed giving the asshole a beat down,” Rock smiled tightly.“I’m so sorry,” I said, and Rock squeezed me, knocking the air from my lungs.“Ain’t your fault, baby. Guessed your brothers weren’t finished with you when you said they’d sold you.” Rock’s voice dropped to a low growl. The sentence hit me hard.“You think they’re going to keep coming for me because of that?” I asked, and Rock hesitated. “Tell me the truth; I can handle it.”“Yeah, we think they’re coming for you because if they don’t, who knows what the asshole who bought you will do. Men like that Carly, they paid for a product and want it.”“But I’m not a product,” I gasped indignantly.“To that type of man, it don’t matter; you don’t matter. Carly, you’re something he bought and paid for, and he wants you. Your asshole brother put a target on your back, but he didn’t bank on Rage being behind you,” Rock said. He let me go, and I twisted in his arms and gazed at the women who were staring silently at me.“We have your back Carly,” Silvie said quietly, and emotion welled inside of me. My hands tightened on Rock’s forearms, and he understood my silent plea.“Gonna, take Carly to the station. She won’t be back today,” Rock said, and Lindsey nodded in agreement.“Take care of her,” Lindsey ordered, and Rock grunted.“Don’t need to be told that.”“No, I don’t suppose you do,” Lindsey smiled, and Rock led me out of the door, and I called goodbyes over my shoulder. Silvie sent me a cheeky grin as the shop door shut and Rock led me to his bike.◆◆◆ Several hours later, we left the station after I signed the first statement and gave a more detailed one of my being held hostage. Then I had to give a statement about today. That one I was more cautious of giving, considering it might implicate Dylan in something. Ramirez ended up reassuring me several times that Dylan wouldn’t be charged with anything. Barney was still at the hospital, needing surgery on his eye, and I felt more than a little smug. I’d successfully defended myself.Dylan was sitting in the waiting room as we left the station, no doubt there to give his own statement. He caught me up in a loose hug and clasped forearms with Rock. They swapped a few words, and Rock steered me from the station.“Fancy checking the storage locker?” Rock asked as he swung a leg over his bike.“Hell yeah,” I said enthusiastically. As of yet, we’d not checked the furniture his grandparents had left. Rock obviously knew what the locker held, but for me, it was a whole new experience. I swung up eagerly behind him, and Rock jammed the helmet over my head. With a roar, we pulled away from the station, and I plastered myself to his back.Half an hour later, I was standing in front of a locker, shaking my head. Rock had lied! I’d expected a storage locker, not a freaking locker the size of a barn. Bewildered, I waited by the entrance as the manager switched the lights on and blinked into the vast space.“But, you said a locker,” I accused, and Rock snorted.“This is a locker; it’s one of several they rent for house clearances. BlackRock uses these a lot when we’re renovating a house. If we’ve bought a house that’s furnished, then we move everything into one of these. There’s an antique dealer that comes in and goes through everything and prices it for us. Once he’s been, there’s a reclamation expert who happens to be the other guy’s brother. After he’s done, we offer stuff to charity and then get rid of it,” Rock said. I blinked at the information.“Who manages that?” I asked.“Apache or I take turns. The next clearance is mine. We have everyone arrive on a set day,” Rock said and looked disgruntled.“You don’t enjoy doing it,” I guessed, and Rock nodded.“Nope.”“But it’s fun going through old stuff and seeing what you can salvage or what you can use to create something new,” I said, astounded. Rock and Apache loved buying old buildings and doing them up, and yet he hated the idea of reclaiming furniture.“Honey, you can keep that fun if you want it.” Rock grinned at me, and I suddenly sensed a trap closing. My mouth dropped open, and I smacked his flat belly.“You want me to do your turn!” I exclaimed. Rock pouted, and I melted.“Silvie does it for Apache,” he complained, and I giggled.“Suppose once a month won’t hurt. But I know nothing about the furniture value or antiques. I might get ripped off,” I said.“No, ya won’t. The people we use know to play fair with us. But if you wanna….” Rock said and made puppy dog eyes at me. I burst into laughter, a badass biker making puppy dog eyes. Rock grinned and dropped a kiss on my lips before spinning me around.“Go find some treasures,” Rock said and gave me a slight shove. There was a hell of a lot of furniture to check. And it was primarily antiques, but nice, good quality stuff. I rummaged around, lifting covers and peeking underneath.“Rock, most of these are wonderful high-quality items, and I’d love to place them back in the house. They’ve been so lovingly cherished,” I said, and Rock beamed.“Hoped you’d say that, I wouldn’t have gotten rid of any of it. But if you wanted modern new stuff, it was your choice, and I didn’t want to pressure you.” Rock admitted.“Rock, I’ve far too much respect for you to disrespect your feelings,” I said and squeezed his hand.“Well, why don’t I get the prospects to load up a couple of trucks this weekend and bring this lot home. Then you can sort through it and put it where you wish,” Rock said.“That sounds wonderful, Rock. Can you remember where everything belongs?” I asked, rubbing my hands together in glee.“Didn’t I say you set up the house how you want?” Rock grunted and rolled his eyes as he escorted me out. As we left, I saw boxes marked with crockery and pottery, and excitement welled. Lots of treasures to be discovered and displayed.Rock drove us to Bernard’s, and we grabbed a meal before heading to Rage. We spent more than half our time in Rock’s room there. When we entered the clubhouse, I was surprised to see only a few brothers there. Blaze, Hunter, and Slick stood near the bar. Savage and Mac played pool, and Axel and Ellen sat on a sofa heckling Mac.“Where is everyone?” I asked in an aside to Rock.“Yeah, I don’t think I’ve seen the clubhouse so empty,” Rock said, puzzled, gazing around.“Those with old ladies are at home. Gauntlet and Calamity are on patrol, and Ezra and Manny are at the bar,” Mac commented. That left Klutz, Lex and Slate. Lex strolled in, chatting to Klutz, carrying takeout.“Hey, you eaten?” Lex called, and Rock’s nose twitched as the smell of tacos wafted through the room. Rock sent me a sheepish look.“Yes, we have, but I’m sure Rock can handle a taco or two,” I laughed, and Rock nodded.“Where’s Slate?” I asked.“He’s running food to the bar for Ezra, Manny, Rooster and Pyro,” Lex said, the latter two names belonging to Rage’s brother club, Hellfire MC. Ah, that made sense. While the bar cooked basic food, it got boring night after night.“How’s your day been?” Ellen asked, snagging a plate with two tacos and coming to sit by me. I wasn’t sure how to take Ellen still, but I sensed she just wanted to be accepted, and she was friendly with a capital F. I summed up my day as Ellen nodded in places. Ellen’s eyes lit up when I described the vast locker.“Oh wow, treasure chest. I love shopping for old antiques. I have little room in my cottage, but I’d love to come and help you sort through them.” Ellen smiled and then blushed. “Sorry, I’m overstepping.” Axel sent a quick glance at his woman, and his brows come down at seeing Ellen redden. I reached over and placed my hand over hers.“Honey, I’d love help because Rock wants me to make his house a home, and I don’t know how to do that,” I said.“Do what? Make a home?” Ellen asked.“Yeah, I’ve no idea, Ellen. And I want Rock to be happy, and when he comes home, I want him to relax.”“Oh, honey, you will instinctively create a home. But I’d love to help you place items. I wonder if we can gather some brothers to do the heavy lifting?” Ellen wondered, gazing at Axel.“Already on it, prospects will be at our house Saturday. Lindsey’s giving you the day off,” Rock said, approaching with a plate of mixed rice and tacos. I rolled my eyes and winced. How Rock wasn’t as fat as a barrel, I didn’t know, but then again, I knew Rock worked out four times a week at the gym. Rock sent me a shit-eating grin and glanced up as Axel sniffed at his plate. In a smooth move, Rock twisted and protected his food from Axel while the big man glared.“You weren’t expected, fucker,” Axel boomed, and I smiled.“Don’t upset Rock, Axel,” Ellen scolded, and Axel pouted. “Carly’s letting me help organise her home.” Axel winced, and Rock and I stared at him curiously.“Prepare for a military operation,” Axel warned, and Ellen poked her tongue out.“Oh?” I asked, suddenly wary.“Well, I get a little OCD sometimes. Axel is exaggerating,” Ellen said and waved a casual hand at Axel.“Ain’t doing no such thing. Tell them, woman, what happened when you arranged my programmes from concerts I been to,” Axel said, folding his arms.“Axel, I merely put them in alphabetical order, and then I arranged them by year once done,” Ellen explained. Rock’s eyes glazed over, and I laughed.“Seriously?” I asked.“Yeah, Axel had eight programmes for Queen, seven for Metallica. You get my drift,” Ellen said superiorly.“Yeah, I’m done,” Rock said and walked away. Axel huffed and followed.“Axel’s not got over it. I also colour coded his tees, and Willow… jeez, that girl is so unorganised,” Ellen moaned. The sinking sensation in my stomach warned me Axel was correct. Ellen would organise Saturday like a military operation. However, seeing the delight in her eyes and the way her hands were rubbing together, I couldn’t back out now. Ellen was far too excited.“Maybe we should get Sin to come or Reid,” I suggested suddenly. Ellen turned a sharp gaze on me.“Why?” Ellen asked.“Because most of the furniture I uncovered was antiques. If I don’t like something, they could price it up or maybe something is valuable and may need insuring,” I said, and Ellen nodded.“That makes sense,” she said, “I’m so excited; we’re going to have so much fun Saturday!” Ellen exclaimed, and I felt it too. Her enthusiasm was catching, and I was looking forward to Saturday as well. Rock strode over and grabbed my hand, pulling me up.“Taking my girl for a moonlight ride,” he said to Ellen with a smile. Her face softened, and an aww expression crossed her face.“How sweet Rock, I always knew you had it in you,” Ellen said, patting his arm. Rock looked horrified, and I vainly stifled laughter. Rock’s image was that of a gruff, silent biker, not a romantic suitor.“It’s just a bike ride,” Rock mumbled.“No Rock, it’s love,” Ellen said and squealed as Axel tilted her chair back and planted a kiss on her lips.“Run now, I’ve got Ellen occupied,” Axel boomed, and we laughed as Rock dragged me through the clubhouse. I heard Ellen laughing as Axel dropped another kiss on her mouth, and Rock pulled me through the door and straight to his bike.",

      "content": "Chapter Six.“Good morning!” Ellen chirped at eight o’clock Saturday morning. I blinked blearily at the cheerful woman as she held up a bag of pastries and coffee. I snatched the coffee without a second thought as Ellen breezed past me and into the house. Not functioning yet, I followed her as Ellen wandered around and finally landed in the kitchen. Ellen was opening drawers and peering in cupboards, and clucking her tongue.“What time is it?” Rock complained as he entered the kitchen wearing low-slung jeans. My mouth watered at the sight of his chest, and I fixated on it happily.“Eight o’clock, and you sound just like the prospects did when I roused them an hour ago,” Ellen chirped, and Rock and I swapped unhappy glances. Had Ellen forgot it was Saturday? I silently whined. The one day, I could have had a lay-in and be lazy. But, instead, Ellen was a cruel, cruel person who ruthlessly woke up innocently sleeping people.“Where’s Axel?” Rock grunted, reaching for the coffee.“Oh, he’s supervising the prospects. Axel’s a grumpy bear in the morning, so I thought he could work it out on them before coming here,” Ellen said, grinning. Okay, that confirmed it. Ellen was desperately cruel and evil. Ellen setting a grumpy Axel on the prospects was unadulterated evil. Blacker than black, darker than dark. Why on earth would Ellen do that to those poor prospects?“Fuckers won’t know what’s hit them,” Rock confirmed my thoughts.“Well, they’ll certainly be awake when moving your furniture. Now I plan to have everything laid out in the front yard, and then we can see what goes where. Go shower Carly and dress in old clothing. Sin’s on her way too, and she’s bringing breakfast. These were cheeky early morning snacks,” Ellen said, holding up the bag of pastries. Rock snatched it and pulled out a bear claw. He passed me a cinnamon bun, and I bit into it, happily inhaling the scent of the spice. I was a cinnamon freak. If something contained the spice, I ate it.“Jett’s coming?” Rock asked, looking hopeful.“Jett’s bringing the babies later,” Ellen said, and Rock looked crestfallen. “No getting out of work, Rock!” I snatched a second cinnamon roll and picked up my coffee, which was also cinnamon flavoured, and let Rock lead me from the kitchen. This was shaping up to be a busy, chaotic day.Three hours later, I stared at the mass of furniture spread over the front yard. There was that much of it I didn’t know where to start, and Ellen was busying herself from piece-to-piece cooing over them.“You look ever so pale,” Sin said, approaching.“Yeah, I think I underestimated the magnitude of the task ahead of me,” I said, waving a hand. Rock and Axel had taken one glance at the yard and disappeared around the back. The prospects lay on the grass looking winded.“Okay, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Then, when you open them, walk around the furniture. And when you feel an item should be placed in a certain room, shout up, and I’ll pop a post-it on it,” Ellen chirped, approaching at speed. Dubiously sending Ellen a look, I did as she ordered but took several breaths and then opened my eyes. The first thing I spied was a hand-carved cabinet and knew where it belonged.“Entrance hall, that dresser in the dining room, and that coffee table in the snug,” I said, pointing at the three things. Sin dashed over and wrote on post-its and stuck them on the furniture.“Glad we’re doing this now,” Ellen said, glancing at her phone. “The weather is predicting heavy rainfall next week.” I made a moue with my mouth. Yeah, I’d have hated moving in during that. But now I had an idea on how to label the furniture, everything went much quicker. The prospects began moving the furniture into the rooms, and within a few more hours, the yard was empty. The house, however, was a mess. I sighed because my work was not yet done. But the good news was, Rosie, Jodie and Serenity arrived, bringing a hamper of food.“Wonderful!” Ellen cried, clapping her hands together.“Willow was coming, but she’s been called into work,” Serenity said. I studied Drake’s daughters and noted the tiredness in their faces. They’d been flying back and forth ever since Harley had been put into a coma. The little bastards who’d attacked Harley had suffered huge servings of karma.“Yes, Willow said she’s just landed a case,” Ellen said with a frown.“Do we need to worry?” I asked, and Ellen shook her head.“No, this isn’t as dangerous as Willow being undercover. A simple, straightforward case Willow claims,” Ellen said, reassuring us.“That’s good. So do you want any help?” Jodie asked.“Can you afford to break a nail?” I teased, and Jodie poked her tongue out. I responded in kind, and we smiled.“Yes, I can afford to break a nail, Serenity, however, can’t,” Jodie said teasingly, and Serenity broke a piece of bread off her sandwich and threw it at Jodie.“Says the prima donna,” Serenity retorted. “Say, as you’re with Rock, you know that makes you our Aunt Carly.” I blanched as Serenity began laughing hysterically. Jodie’s eyes held a wicked glint as a slow smile crossed her face.“Don’t you even dare!” I warned Jodie, who broke into gales of laughter. A car pulled up, and Penny climbed out with Texas and their two younger children. Penny glanced around and put her fingers to her lips, and whistled. Rosie trotted over, opened the SUV trunk, and picked up a large container with bread rolls.“Hey girls, I brought food, enough for an army,” Penny called as brothers appeared from every direction and sniffed the air.“What we got, Penny?” Calamity asked, approaching at speed.“Chilli dogs, two Enchilagne and pastries,” Penny called back, and she became muffled as hulking brothers and prospects surrounded her. Moments later, Axel, Texas, Rock and the prospects carried urns and containers back. Texas didn’t appear happy, and Rosie leaned over in an aside.“Dad loves Mom’s Enchilagne, but god help us if he has to share it. Mom’s made Dad two at home,” Rosie confided.“Talk about poor communication; we bring a hamper, and Penny brings a feast,” Serenity smiled as we heard sounds of fighting coming from the backyard. Wandering around, we saw the brothers lined up in front of a table and Penny giving them a stern gaze.“Behave, I’ll serve you and then when the girls have put some aside, you may help yourself to the leftovers!” Penny warned. We watched in amusement as Penny served each brother a generous helping of Enchilagne and three chilli dogs laden with cheese and nacho toppings. Texas was balefully looking at the rapidly emptying tins and muttering under his breath.“Dad,” Rosie hissed, and Texas glanced across. “Mom saved two at home for you.” Texas’s head twisted so he could face the innocent expression Penny was offering, and he sighed.“Might have guessed, there’s no way Penny would starve her man,” Texas rumbled, and Axel snorted.“Wanna bet, Penny loves me more,” Axel teased, which didn’t go down too well with Texas.“Can you believe how they fight over food?” Ellen said, sitting with a chilli dog. Penny had covered up slices of the Enchilagne and chilli dogs for us to eat later, and the seven men in my backyard were eyeing the leftovers greedily.“Have you seen Rock when it’s the last taco?” I asked. Ellen blanched and nodded. “Like all men, they live through their stomach.”“Truthfully, it’s a wonder Uncle Ace survives. Aunt Artemis is a terrible cook,” Serenity said. Everyone who heard Serenity’s words blanched. No lie, Artemis was terrible; she’d once put Ace in the hospital trying to make a pie.“That’s why she has Mrs Humphries,” Rosie said, and we nodded.“After Artemis poisoned Ace with that peach pie, I don’t think I’ve eaten peach pie since,” Rock mused, and everyone nodded. Ace’s poisoning had been so violent none of us had eaten it since then.“Did you hear what Dad’s trying to do for Mum?” Jodie asked, and we shook our heads. “Dad wants a picture of all the kids together, from big to little, but he wants it done as a portrait. Dad’s having murder getting us together and has been banging his head against a brick wall for the last six weeks,” Jodie said, grinning.“Poor Drake,” I muttered. Having to gather eighteen kids together for a family event was a logistical nightmare. Then my thoughts turned to Harley.“Dad’s providing the artist a picture of Harley,” Serenity said, reading my thoughts. But, jeez, it was nearly a year since Harley had been attacked from behind and put into a coma. Serenity’s smiling face disappeared, and I put a hand out and touched her arm.“Harley will recover; he’s just lazy. He’s hung on this long, and they didn’t think he’d make it through the first night. Then they said twenty-four hours, and so on. Harley has fought every battle and is now being lazy, taking his time, but he will wake up,” I said fiercely, and Jodie and Serenity smiled. That shit had to be so hard for them. Their younger sibling trapped in a world Harley couldn’t escape.That was one thing I sincerely admired Phoe and Drake for. Although mainly Phoe, because Drake had only been around a short while. But they raised their kids to believe that a blood bond didn’t mean shit. Blood could easily betray one another. It didn’t matter that most of their kids were adopted. Once Phoe’s brood claimed them, they were family. And those kids stuck together through thick and thin. All of them were terrific kids, even the little ones. And Drake had taken on sixteen kids that weren’t any tie to him other than the fact they belonged to the woman he loved. And it had to be love to offer that level of commitment.After a long break, we began moving furniture around inside. Once each room was placed as I wanted, Rosie, Serenity, Jodie and Penny started dusting, cleaning and hoovering. Of course, the guys grunted and complained as they moved the furniture where I wanted it to go, bitching when I changed my mind on a placement. But by six that evening, everything was done. The bedrooms had beds in, and Klutz and Calamity had been whizzes at putting them together. The dining room held a twenty-seat long table and sideboards, all the rooms were now cosy and welcoming. And I was happier than a pig in muck as to how it had gone so wonderfully well.The prospects left first, nearly running to their bikes in haste to get away from mine and Ellen’s enthusiastic thank you’s. Jett (who’d arrived with his girls), Texas, Rock and Axel sat on the back patio gazing at the garden.“Needs an overhaul,” Axel boomed as we approached.“Yeah, Ezra has been booked in for a fortnight. Told Ezra what I want doing with it,” Rock grunted as I slid around to him. Rock hooked an arm lazily around my waist and pulled me into his lap.“Do I get to know?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope,” Rock said, popping the p in nope. “It’s a surprise and one you can keep that cute little nose out of.”“Well, I need food,” Penny said, glancing at the table where only crumbs remained. Strangely enough, every brother sat up and became alert. I swapped glances with Penny and Ellen, and we laughed.“There’s a new sushi place in town,” Serenity suggested, and the men shook their heads.“Fried chicken?” Jett suggested, and everyone nodded. The chicken place also did the best barbecue ribs ever, so I ordered a rack of them. Rock, Sin and Jodie followed suit on my idea of chicken and ribs, and Texas phoned it through and gave them the address. I wondered if we were outside of their delivery range, but as soon as Texas gave his name, it didn’t matter. I half expected they’d deliver to the next state over if it involved Rage.Jett started the firepit as Amelia settled herself on Axel’s lap, and Ellen held baby Brooke. Ellen had no children of her own, which clearly meant no grandchildren. But coming into Axel’s life, Ellen suddenly discovered an abundance of children and was in grandmother heaven. After spending the entire day with her, I saw Ellen for what she was, a kind, caring, genuine soul who had a lot of love to offer. Axel was one lucky man. When they went home, I was slightly tipsy and determined to make Rock mine that night.Rock was downstairs as I showered and dressed in a skimpy baby doll nightdress. It wasn’t something I’d usually wear, but Rock’s eyes had lit up when I held it up to him. I arranged myself on the bed, trying for a sexy pose and feeling awkward and stupid. Damn this, I was a virgin and didn’t know how to seduce the man I desired so badly. I heard footsteps and started to move when the door opened, and, blushing, I lay back and gazed into Rock’s surprised eyes.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Rock, I want to make love. Because I’m tired of waiting around for you to make a move,” I said boldly, and Rock’s eyes flared, and I saw a stiffening in his jeans.“Ah,” Rock said and gulped. That was good, right? A gulp?“Please don’t say no, please don’t refuse me,” I begged, a little ashamed. I’d put myself out there and needed Rock to meet me halfway. Rock ran a hand across his face and strolled to the bed.“Carly, I want you. Never mistake that. But there’s a reason I’ve been hesitant. Vanilla sex is great, but there’s another version that I far more prefer. And I was biding my time to let you get used to being us before introducing you to it,” Rock said quietly. My curiosity peaked. What exactly was Rock into sexually?“Dominant sex?” I asked, yeah I’d read Fifty Shades.“No,” Rock said shortly, and I could see his mind churning. “Forget it. We’ll go with vanilla.”“Rock, talk to me. I’m your girl. There’s nothing you can’t tell me,” I encouraged, and Rock dropped his head.“Well… I prefer Shibari,” Rock said, and my mind stuttered. What on earth was Shibari?“Huh?” I said, confused.“Shibari is an artistic form of Japanese rope bondage. It’s a deeply intimate form of sex because you have to trust me completely to let me practise on you. Any doubt and it becomes uncomfortable for both of us. Here look,” Rock said, dragging his phone out, and I scooted closer. Rock pulled up some pictures and showed them to me. Amazed, I stared at the intricate knots making beautiful patterns binding a woman’s arms behind her back. I flipped to the next and blushed as I saw a woman’s torso bound and her breasts tied.“You practise this?” I asked, swiping again and studying another.“Yeah, I do, took classes with Lex. We both became adept at Shibari. Shibari is far different from normal bondage. I get aroused by the trust you place in me when I tie you. Normal bondage is about restraining you, Shibari is about freeing you. Even the ropes differ. Shibari uses natural fibres, while normal bondage uses hemp, polycotton or nylon. The natural fibres in Shibari ropes add to the arousal of yourself,” Rock said earnestly, explaining. I was stunned. I’d never have believed Rock was into this. Yet, I was aroused. The thought of trusting Rock completely and putting myself in his hands caused a trickle of sensation between my legs.“So Shibari isn’t about restraint?” I asked.“No, look, see how her torso is bound, but her arms and legs are free. Shibari is about you trusting me to be intimate with your body and allowing me to bind you. Shibari can cause some pain depending on the practitioner, but I only cause pleasurable pain with it. I don’t like to cause pain for the sake of it. Done correctly, the pain caused by Shibari should always be pleasurable,” Rock explained.“Go on,” I said quietly, listening.“For me, each tie, each knot means something; it places you fully in my hands. It’s not meant to be degrading or violent. Shibari’s about pleasure, allowing me to touch you and share intimacy together. There’s different thickness in ropes, and sometimes you can use silk to caress the skin, making the experience more pleasure. The sensation of the rope and ties make your skin more sensitive. You receive pleasure in your own submission and trust. With every knot I tie, I feel your surrender, and it’s terribly empowering,” Rock said, his hands dangling loosely on his knees.“And this arouses you?” I asked, needing to know.“More than vanilla or BDSM? Yes, Shibari arouses me painfully,” Rock admitted.“Where would you tie me?” I asked, needing to know.“To start, I wouldn’t bind your arms together or anything straight away. We could start with wrapping one arm and moving across your chest here.” Rock stroked the skin above my breasts. “And then bind the other arm. You would be free to move and stop me if needed,” Rock said, his eyes alert.“I’m okay with that,” I said, and before Rock could say anything, I gathered my courage and pulled my nightie off. Rock’s eyes flared as he gazed at my body, and he swallowed hard.“Fuck, I’ve seen you naked before, but this time is different,” Rock said and took my mouth in a deep kiss. He broke it off and rolled off the bed and got to his knees, and pulled a box out from under the bed. I peered over as Rock opened it, and I saw coloured rope inside it.“Feel this Carly, it’s the one I intend you use.” I reached out and touched the blue rope; it was silky and smooth. But it was rather thick, and that worried me. So I peered into the box and saw thinner ropes.“Why not them?” I asked.“The thinner the rope, the more intense. The thinness puts pressure on your skin and pressure points, so a thick rope is the best to start with. Thin rope used wrongly can bite into your skin, and as a beginner, you may struggle, hurting yourself. Thick rope introduces you to the act of Shibari,” Rock explained.“Okay, so what do I do?” I asked.“Stand up and let me love you,” Rock replied. Taking a deep breath, I stood up in front of Rock as his eyes drank in my body.“As I tie you, I’ll touch and kiss your skin,” Rock said, unwrapping the rope. Rock stripped and dumped his clothes as I took in his hard, muscled body. “I want you to see the effect you have on me as I can feel the effect I have on you.” Gently Rock took my hand, and standing in front of me, placed it on his chest. I swallowed hard as Rock draped the rope around me, letting my skin become used to the sensation. Gently Rock started to tie and make knots, and I shivered under his hands and mouth. With each knot Rock tied, he dropped a kiss on the skin just below.Slowly Rock worked his way up my arm, his gaze focused and intent on the act of tying. His cock was so hard, I thought it would break. As Rock stepped closer, his cock pressed against my stomach, and a moan left my mouth. Wetness pooled between my legs, and I ached for his touch.I lost myself in Rock’s world, entirely under his control and ready to obey anything he commanded. Once my arm was done, Rock took another length of rope and bound my other arm. I didn’t know if I could wait for Rock to bind my chest, as desire was all I could think of. That and Rock’s hot mouth caressing my skin in featherlight touches. I stared at my arms intricately bound and yet at the same time a simple pattern. The knots looked beautiful, and I admired Rock’s skill. Rock’s breathing had changed halfway to finishing my first arm, and now as he stepped back, his unsteady breathing turned to panting.Concentration on his face, Rock unravelled the third rope and began binding above my chest, resting on my collar bones but not near my neck. I could barely stand. Rock was right. This was so intense, I trusted Rock to pull the ropes tightly but not hurt me. Aroused, I allowed Rock to bind my chest but leave me free to back away if needed. Featherlight touches aroused my skin until it almost became torturous, and I understood the painful pleasure Rock had spoken of.When he was done, Rock stepped back and stared at me. His cock was twitching and wet at the top, nipples hard and sacs drawn up tightly. My own nipples were tight little bullets, and my breasts a flushed pink. Between my legs, I was so wet it was painful. Rock took my hand and led me to the bed. Carefully, Rock laid me down, and I wondered what to do. Rock arranged my legs and knelt between them. His face was tight with desire, and slowly Rock lifted my arms above my head, the action drawing my breasts higher, and nodded. Rock bent down and took a nipple in his mouth, one hand caressing the knots on my arm.A cry left my lips as Rock’s hot wet mouth sucked my nipple hard, and Rock ran his fingers down the knots, and my skin reacted sensitively. My head dropped back to the pillows as Rock reluctantly dragged his mouth from my nipple and swooped on the other. My hips moved wildly, my body telling me what it needed, although I wasn’t experienced. Rock shuffled up, and my legs clamped around one of his knees. I gasped as I realised I could move, and the friction of Rock’s skin on my wet pussy made me cry again.“Rock,” I gasped. Rock broke off from my nipple and leant on his arms as he drew in deep, ragged breaths.“It’s okay, baby,” Rock said, kissing me and his hand stroked my skin. The world was on fire. Every nerve was electrified, and I needed release. My pussy spasmed against his skin, and Rock shuffled down the bed and dropped between my legs. Rock kissed each thigh, and he gently put my legs over his shoulders. Cold air slapped against my clit as he opened my folds, and I let out a tortured cry.“Let go, baby,” Rock muttered and dipped his head between my legs. The first touch of his tongue sent my hips thrusting up as I screamed. The second touch drowned me in sensation, and I gave over to my body’s demands. Wild cries left my lips as my hips thrust against his mouth, and Rock held my ass cheeks, lifting me up and helping me grind against him. Finally, with a strangled scream, I exploded and collapsed on the bed.“I’m going to enter you, Carly. Baby, I can’t last any longer,” Rock said, his huge body rising above me. I nodded weakly, unable to answer, and Rock gathered my hands above my head and held them in one hand. Slowly, his cock prodded my entrance, and Rock fed himself into me. The empty sensation I’d suffered disappeared as his huge cock filled me. Rock hit the barrier of my virginity and paused.“Will it hurt?” I mumbled, holding his gaze.“Somewhat,” Rock murmured regretfully and thrust through the barrier. My pained cry broke out, and Rock kissed me deeply, drawing my cry into his mouth. Rock’s body was tense and solid as he held himself still to allow me to adjust to his size. My first reaction had been to buck Rock off and fight him, but slowly I relaxed, and my pussy held him tight. Rock shifted and seated himself fully in me, and the emptiness finally disappeared.“So fuckin’ tight,” Rock growled and withdrew and pushed back in slowly. I winced as pain pinched again, and then it was gone. I wriggled my hips and moved tentatively with him, and Rock hissed.“Wrap your legs around me, baby,” Rock demanded, and I obeyed, feeling him slide even deeper into me. Rock started a slow thrust of in and out, and I met his movements. As soon as Rock realised I was pain-free, his thrusts sped up, and I abandoned myself to the sensations he was creating. The only things I was aware of was the feel of Rock’s skin against mine, his cock hammering inside me and the sensations of the rope. Pressure built, and Rock sensed it. He thrust harder, pushing a second release for me, and we both cried out together as we exploded in each other’s arms.Rock collapsed onto his forearms, holding his weight off of me as he pumped a couple of times lazily and stilled. Our skin was slippery with sweat, and Rock’s hair hung over his eyes. When he looked up, he took my mouth before slipping out and rolling on his side. Rock drew me tightly into his embrace.“I love you,” Rock whispered, and I nestled more tightly against him.“I love you too,” I whispered back, and Rock stiffened.“Shit Carly, I forgot a condom,” Rock cried and smacked himself on the forehead.“It’s okay, I’m on the pill,” I replied, and Rock relaxed.“Thought I’d fucked up,” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“No,” I said. “That was amazing. I didn’t know sex could be like that.” Rock chuckled against my skin, his beard tickling me.“Why do you think we keep dragging our old ladies into the back rooms?” Rock asked.“You can drag me anytime you wish. Will you need rope each time?” I asked. Rock ran his fingers down my still bound arms.“No, I just prefer it, but I can imagine your body like this if I wanted to,” Rock said, tracing knots.“I felt amazing, like you knew how hard to tie and when not to, I felt completely safe and cherished.”“Good, that’s how you were meant to feel,” Rock said. His cock poked at me again, and I giggled.“Love that sound Carly,” Rock said, getting to his feet. I couldn’t believe his cock was ready again, and I watched Rock’s taut ass stroll across to the bathroom. He came back minutes later, his cock still twitching and hard. Rock cleaned between my legs, and his eyes twinkled at me.“Round two?” Rock teased. I gave a teasing sigh and flopped on my back, opening my legs.“If you insist!” I teased, and Rock laughed.“Oh, Carly, where you’re concerned, I’ll always insist!” Rock said and bent his head.◆◆◆ Hours later, I traced the marks on my arms that the knots had left. Rock had assured me they would fade quickly, which I thought was a shame after looking at the patterns. Rock sat behind me in the huge bath the ensuite had. He lazily washed my stomach and breasts as I leaned my head back against his chest. We’d made love several times before Rock called a halt, explaining I wouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow. While I teased him, laughing about his prowess, Rock had explained patiently that I’d used muscles in different ways than they should be used. That made sense.Rock poured water over my head, startling me from my thoughts and making me jump. A rough chuckle left Rock’s lips as he began massaging shampoo into my hair, and a soft moan escaped my lips. I’d always loved my hair being brushed or played with, and this was heaven to me. A large hand covered my eyes and rinsed me clean. Rock shunted me forward and surged upwards out of the bath, water pouring off him.Rock deftly wrapped me in a towel and, with a wink, scooped me into his arms and carried me into the bedroom. I snuggled against his chest, happy to be close to him, and abruptly Rock placed me on my feet and began drying me. There was no embarrassment between us now. On the contrary, I was more than happy for Rock to look over my body. Especially as I knew what Rock could do to me.“Naked sleeping?” Rock asked. I didn’t reply but scrambled buck naked into bed.◆◆◆ Hell, I was sore the next day, as Rock had predicted. I had a quick shower before I dressed, and then I made my way to the kitchen, where Rock was glowering at his phone. Rock reached out an arm, and I grabbed the coffee he was offering.“Baby, I’m sorry. Gotta head to the office for a couple of hours,” Rock said grimly.“Is everything okay?” I asked, worried.“No, a bloody idiot had a fall on our site because he refused to wear the correct safety gear. I need to take statements. Can you stay here today? The weather’s predicting a big storm. The weather channel is warning everyone to stay home where it will be safer. I’m going to take the SUV, will leave my bike and Charger here.”“Sure. Is it going to be bad? Will we be affected by the storm?” I asked, peering at the tv.“Road closure and possible localised flooding. So stay put, baby, please,” Rock asked.“Okay,” I said happily, planning my lazy day until Rock got home. Rock pulled me to him and dropped a searing kiss on my mouth.“Hurry back,” I muttered when Rock pulled away.“You can bet on that, no sex today, you need to recover, but there’s plenty more we can do.” Rock winked as I pouted. “Be good!” Rock said, tapping me on the ass. In reply, I waggled my ass, and Rock chuckled and kissed me one more time before leaving. Tiredly yawning, I poured cereal and sat on a stool and turned the tv up louder.Rock had been correct, I mused as I studied the vast weather system heading towards us. I loved storms and was hoping this would be a doozy. I listened carefully to the warnings as I did a quick sweep around the house, making sure all windows were closed and locked. And I checked the doors were also shut in each room. If a window blew and the door wasn’t shut properly, then the wind could cause untold damage blowing through an open house.Once I’d done the inside, I donned a heavy coat and boots and went outside. The garden furniture needed storing away, and once that was done, I checked for anything else loose and tied it down or shoved it in the garage. I’d just finished everything when my phone beeped, and I looked down. A message popped up from Rock telling me to head to the clubhouse, as the weather warnings had been ramped up. I glanced at the sky and was startled to see how black and heavy it was looking. Distant thunder rumbled, and I knew the storm would reach us soon.I jogged inside and grabbed the keys to Rock’s beloved Charger, and ran out to the garage. The thunder sounded closer now, and I didn’t hesitate throttling the car. I had just reached Jackson Blvd when the sky opened, and the rain came down heavily. Even though the Charger’s windscreen wipers worked frantically, I had to slow to a crawl because visibility was zero. Bright headlights flooded my back window, and I cursed at the idiot who was fast coming up my ass. Peering through the window, I saw a spot to pull over and let the asshole go past.Instead, to my surprise, the asshole pulled in behind, and I wondered if it was one of the Rage brothers. Some of them had trucks and SUVs. Unsure whether to get out of the car or not, I hesitated. But the decision was taken from my hands when the door was yanked open, and a fist flew towards my face. The last thing I saw was Otis’s gloating grin.",

      "title": "Chapter 16",
      "content": "Chapter Seven.Otis took the corner far too fast as the wheels skidded on the slick road surface. The rain fell heavier now, making visibility poor, and it was too dangerous to be driving in. Let alone at the speed Otis was driving. Otis took the turning on Sheridan Lake Road and spun us onto the Old State Highway 40. The sky was blacker than black. I’d never seen it so heavy and dark. Clouds rolled and crashed together, and I knew Otis needed to slow down. Luckily for me, Hans was busy holding on to the oh shit strap and cursing Otis under his breath. Ha, Hans didn’t look so cocky or arrogant now.Muttering, Otis thumped the beat-up Sat Nav that had never worked right, and I smothered a smile as I realised he was doubling back on himself towards Highway 44. Otis just kept proving what a complete idiot he was. After Otis had knocked me out, I’d woken up in Otis’s truck with Hans greedily grinning at me and stroking my leg.“Otis, you need to slow,” I said, and Otis cursed. Hans turned to me.“What? So you can escape, princess?” Hans sneered.“Nope, because the weather gave out flood warnings, and you may be racing straight into them. There’s no one on the streets, Otis; people have already been evacuated from this area, asshole. There was a flood in 1972, and it destroyed loads of property and people. You heading into the Hills makes you fools,” I said. I didn’t want to go up there; I could sense something was wrong. And I didn’t want to hang around to discover what lay ahead.“The cabin’s up in the Hills, once we get Carly there, they won’t find her,” Otis said, and I laughed.“Did you not hear me? Dimwits, we can’t go into the Hills; they were warning of flash flooding,” I yelled.“When we get to the cabin, the flash flooding will keep your fuckin’ friends away,” Otis snarled, and I rolled my eyes. The truck’s tyres slipped on the road, and I knew slowly, but surely the car was losing traction.“Christ sake Otis, I’m not a virgin anymore. My man took it, so stop this bullshit. Our lives aren’t worth the risk!” I yelled.“What!” Hans yelled, turning a black look on me.“Yeah, asshole, you missed your chance,” I sneered.“Maybe, but you just opened yourself to a world of pain; I bought your virginity!” Hans seethed.“I didn’t sell it to you, asshole; I did not agree to be raped by you,” I yelled.“Shut the fuck up, Carly!” Otis yelled as the car skidded, and I yelped.“For fuck’s sake, Otis, no one will get to the cabin in this,” I said and screamed as a lightning bolt hit a tree near to us. Crap, that was close. “Otis, stop!” I screamed, and finally, Hans looked worried.“The cabin is around here, shut up,” Otis snarled and twisted the wheel, fighting the water running down the road. Frightened, I held my breath as we passed Nameless Cave Road. My home was there. If I could get out of this damned truck, I’d be able to get home and find a weapon. The road flashed past, and I cursed silently. I needed a miracle to get out of this alive. Otis began cursing furiously as the tail end of the truck started moving with the water. A quick glance outside confirmed my suspicions. The water flowing downhill was fast becoming a problem, and the truck couldn’t gain traction.There was only one way this shitty mess was ending. And I planned to survive. Wishing them to hell, I rolled off the seat and curled into the footwell of the backseat. Hans shot a look over his shoulder and sneered. Let Hans mock; his will be the head bouncing off the glass. Yeah, Otis had mad driving skills, but no one was going to keep a vehicle on this road. No soon had the thoughts left my head lightning struck, and a loud crack screamed across the Hills. Shrilly screaming, I covered my head with my hands and assumed the crash position.The back end of the truck flipped out, and Otis struggled to keep it on the road. The back hit something hard, sending a tearing noise through the inside, and the truck spun, hitting something else hard and was shoved backwards. Shit, we didn’t want to be going backwards down a ravine! Metal screamed as Otis still tried to stupidly control the truck, but it was far too late. The truck began gathering speed as we rolled backwards, and Otis cried out the brakes weren’t working. Give the genius a prize, everyone! Glass smashed, and I screamed as rain flew in the windows, soaking me on the floor.The truck hit something hard, so hard I felt the back crumple under the impact, but it didn’t stop there. The vehicle spun 180 degrees as the front tyres kept moving, and we began sliding forward before hitting something again hard. Finally, we stopped moving. Warily I glanced up, and although there were cuts to my hands and arms from protecting me, they’d heal. The truck gave an indignant hiss and settled. A thick branch had come through the front window, and as I pushed my shoulders back against my door, it opened a little and stuck.I could see Hans hanging in his seat, unconscious and blood dripping down his face. Otis, I couldn’t see because of the leafy branch covering his body. As I scrabbled to my knees, I cut them on a large piece of glass and swore. That had really hurt. Roughly pushing my bound hands in front of me, I began sawing back and forth to gain freedom. The ropes frayed, and I struggled for a few minutes before my hands were freed. Panicked, I kicked at the opposite door, and to my surprise, it gave way and opened. Trying not to cry as glass cut into my hands, I pulled myself forward and fell out into the rain and wind. The sky was so black it appeared night. No time to hesitate. I needed help and checked my pockets for my phone, only to remember Otis had taken it.Gingerly I pulled myself to my feet, and luckily it didn’t seem I’d broken any bones. I held onto the door as rain lashed me, and I wiped the water from my face. The wind blew the door shut, and I walked round to Otis’s side. My brother lay silent with his head outside the window, and I wondered if Otis was dead. No lie, I felt more than a little squeamish touching Otis, but I reached out and patted him down. I found my phone in his front pocket. The screen smashed and switched off, but I held out hope. Desperately, I brushed my hair out of my eyes and jumped again as lightning hit close by me.The weather had been very wrong. The weather channel mentioned a storm, but this raging nightmare was more than a storm. This was hell on earth. Otis’s eyes snapped open, and I cried out as he stared at me, dazed. Without a second thought, I took off, scrambling to escape. I’d had a few moments before searching Otis to get my bearings. The truck had been forced off the road and down a steep, jagged incline. The car had crashed to a halt against the trees, so the only way to go was up.In the pouring rain, without good visibility, I had to scramble up the slope. Loudly, I cursed the fact I’d sneakers on and a sweater, but no coat or boots. My jeans were soaked through already. Frantic to escape, I grabbed tree roots to haul myself up and finally reached the top. I took a couple of deep breaths and turned to jog down the road towards home when I froze in horror. Below me, the creek had flooded the road, and there was nothing to be seen. A fast-running, well, small river flowed across the road, and I shivered in the chilly air. There was only one way to go, and that was up. Two torch lights lit the darkness below me.Without hesitation, I set off at a steady pace. Otis and Hans wouldn’t catch me again, not without a seriously bitter fight. Yeah, I was wet, sore and miserable, but that was nothing compared to getting away from those two. I wasn’t sure whether to stay on the road or disappear into the forest. The choice was taken out of my hands when a torch swept close to me on the road, and I dived into the bushes to hide. They’d be running on an even flat surface, and I’d be slowed by trees, rocks and bushes, but at least I’d have cover.The rain hid much of the noise I made, and I was soaked through and thoroughly miserable. I ducked below tree branches swinging in the strong winds and kept heading upwards. I needed to find somewhere to shack up, a hut or cave perhaps. Just somewhere I could hole up, dry out, and rest. A twig snapped loudly near me, and I crouched amongst the mud and bushes, wondering if I’d been found. My eyes tiredly searched the darkness, but I couldn’t see a flash of light giving away a torch.Quietly, I moved forward, keeping low and trying to keep a lookout. Rock would come for me; someone would get word back to Rage that Otis and Hans had snatched me. Rock’s Charger was open and abandoned on the side of the road. Someone would find it. So the primary goal was to survive until this rain stopped and Rock found me. I ducked under a bush, wanting to check if my phone would work. Fingers metaphorically crossed and huddled in a ball to hide any sign of light, I pressed the on button and prayed. A few seconds later, my prayer was dashed when the screen stayed dark. The urge to rail against my circumstances nearly overwhelmed me, but I kept pushing onwards. Otis and Hans were out there somewhere.◆◆◆ “Did you get the alert?” Drake asked as he walked into Rage.“Yeah, the roads are flooding by the creek; mountain rescue is calling for help. People are trapped, and there’s been one mudslide, and they’re expecting more. Medics are setting up triage, but they’re swamped,” Ace replied as he pulled on wet gear. Drake looked around the clubhouse.“No one ride bikes; we go in four-wheel drives,” Drake said, checking who was present. The year they’d got Rage clean, they’d all signed on for mountain rescue, the start of Rage putting something back into their city. Rage usually did a week or two volunteering each year.“The entire area is a cesspit. Reports of roads running free with water, cars being stranded, and people trapped. The creek has burst its banks in four places, and it’s a total mess up there. Trees are down, and one team has been caught up and isolated. Too risky to fly a chopper in at this time,” Ace updated everyone.Present was the entire MC, all would be going out on the rescues bar Axel and Texas who were to stay at base camp and help organise teams to respond to calls. The prospects were tasked with being dogsbodies, fetching food, drink, medical kits, and driving vehicles to free up an EMT. They strode towards the cars and climbed in, heading for base camp at Deadman’s Gulch.Rock tried calling Carly to let her know what was happening, but Carly’s phone rang out. He imagined Carly was at home, tucked up safely, and that she hadn’t tried to reach the clubhouse.“Drake, are our homes safe?” Rock asked.“Yeah, our roads are clear, but there’s a lot in the Hills that aren’t,” Drake replied as he checked his rescue backpack, and his radio was working. Soon enough, they pulled up at Deadman Gulch and exited. People were hurrying, trying to get tents set up against the wind blowing them around the emergency camp. Drake motioned, and the prospects made their way over to help. He lifted a hand when three black SUVs arrived, and the men of Hawthorne Investigations arrived.“Who’s in charge?” Dylan Hawthorne asked.“Just arrived. I think the command tent is over there,” Drake said, pointing. Together they began walking in that direction as the storm blew around them. Inside the command tent, they discovered Chief Andre Howser of Rapid City police and the fire department Chief Bill Hawthorne, Dylan’s uncle.“What we got?” Drake asked as several other teams gathered around the table.“The road has washed out just above Elkhart Road, and we’ve people trapped there and including Blake Road. Johnson Siding Station two is covering the area around Cavern Road. The creek has washed out the road at the Naylor’s on the first tight bend on Dark Canyon Road. Anyone above that is trapped, and several have reported mudslides in the area too. Teams are going in six men to a team. No arguments, the situation is dangerous, and you’ll need the extra men,” Chief Hawthorne said.“Bill and I are staying here coordinating. You get diverted, you get trapped, see something hinky; we want to know. Do not risk yourselves in a stupid attempt at heroism, or you’ll never work search and rescue again. Each team is taking a dog handler with them, which makes you seven men. Bill has your teams and assignments,” Chief Howser said. Everyone moved around, looking for team leaders as Bill stood in front of a whiteboard with names written on it. The chief split them up, and Rock and Drake found themselves on the same team as Hawthorne, Officer Lucas and three fire and rescue. Together they formed Blue Team. Grimly they checked radios and headed out, as even more calls came from the families trapped in the Hills.◆◆◆ I no longer knew which way was up or down, left or right. And I’d lost sight of the road ages back when Otis had spotted me and given chase. In my haste to escape, I’d slipped and slid down a hill to get away and rolled into a ditch. I’d become so caked in mud that when Otis had literally stopped within an arm’s length, he’d not seen me.Tiredness had seeped into my bones, along with the bitter chill of the storm and the piercing wetness of the rain. The storm still raged, mother nature showing her power, and it had been roaring for hours. Wet through, I was shaking so badly I knew I’d catch a severe cold. The truth of the matter was, I was completely and utterly lost. My phone had an app that would have picked up my GPS and led me home, but it was useless. For now, I needed somewhere dry to hole up and safe to rest. Branches crunched from behind, and I wearily lifted my head and stared into the malevolent gaze of Hans. Surprised, I fell backwards as Hans lurched forward and sank a hand into my matted hair.And deep inside, my anger lit. I was finished with being pushed around by men who’d no respect for my wishes and desires or my right to live as I saw fit. I was finished being their wet blanket and punching bag. My hand scrabbled in the dirt, and I grabbed a handful of mud, and as Hans swung me around by my hair, I threw the mud in his face. Shakily, I leapt to my feet as Hans roared and clawed at the muck on his face. Clumsily, I fell against a tree after a few steps, and my hand caught on a heavy branch.“No!” I shouted in Han’s face, and as he reached for me, I swung the branch and knocked him straight on his back. Without hesitation, I swung the branch a second time and a third and fourth. Satisfied Hans wouldn’t be getting up soon, I began stumbling away, keeping an eye open for Otis. He couldn’t be far away if Hans was this close. I couldn’t imagine they’d split up.A low rumbling noise echoed off the surrounding inclines, and I glanced around warily. That hadn’t sounded too good. I was aware mudslides had happened in the Black Hills over the years. And I was fully aware that the Rapid Creek had flooded many years ago, and it had affected the Keystone area of Rapid City. There was a shout from behind, and I glanced back to see Otis scrambling towards me with a gun out. Otis fired one shot as a warning, and I dived to the slope and began scrambling up it.◆◆◆ “Reports of gunshots,” Red leader called over the radio, and Drake listened to the coordinates.“That’s near to us,” Hawthorne said, checking the GPS. They’d been in the Hills for several hours now and had performed several rescues.“This fucker needs to break,” Rock grumbled, eyeing the sky.“Not known a storm to last so long,” Drake agreed.“We’re going to head over that way; we’re better equipped. Red Team has two injuries they’re bringing in. May be someone calling for help or someone in trouble,” Officer Lucas said, and the others nodded.“You got the coordinates?” Drake asked, and Lucas nodded.“Yeah, I’ll take point,” Lucas said and checked everyone’s equipment over. They heard a loud rumble and swapped wary gazes.◆◆◆ The rumble came from above me, and I looked up and yelped as I saw the trees moving in the darkness. Trees didn’t move! Terrified and wondering what new horror I was witnessing. I saw the trees heading towards me and picking up speed. Shit, it wasn’t the trees moving; it was a mudslide and a large one at that. I frantically crawled sideways, no longer caring that Otis was behind me. The trees were coming towards me ever quicker, and the rumble was turning into a roar. Desperately wanting to cover my ears but aware of the danger heading towards me, I gave an almighty kick just as the edges of the mudslide clipped my legs.The force of the flowing mud knocked me aside and out of range and luckily not into it. Stretching, I reached for a tree branch and clung on tightly as mud flowed past me with trees, bushes, rocks, and other debris. There was only a foot between me and the flow. Although the sound was a roar, there was a dullness to it; it was a horrifying sound and one I knew would haunt me. Well, it would as long as I survived this, alive and intact.In survival mode, I drew my knee’s up and clung to the tree branch, and after several long minutes, the flood dropped to a slow trickle. Gasping for breath, I gazed around and couldn’t believe my eyes when I spied Otis clinging to a tree in the middle of the flood. His waist and hips were covered by the mud, and he looked to be hurt. Even then, Otis sneered, and to my disbelief, he drew a line of sight on me. I flipped him the finger and disappeared into the undergrowth. Fuck him and fuck helping him; Otis could go hang. ◆◆◆ “Man down,” Lucas called as they entered a small clearing. He withdrew his sidearm as he approached and forewarned Drake. Rock, and Hawthorne drew theirs.“What is it?” Drake asked, blinking rain out of his eyes.“Man’s been attacked, hit hard with the branch. Hey, you two, get over here,” Lucas called to the medics. They radioed in their position, and they watched as they rolled the man over and went to lay him on a backboard. Rock glimpsed something pink and leapt forward.“Wait,” he said and knelt in the mud and picked up a mud-covered phone. Rock’s guts twisted as he recognised the case, and he didn’t need to see the name on the back. Grimly Rock turned the phone and showed Drake the back. Drake’s jaw dropped open as Hawthorne leaned forward. Rock bent over the beaten man and began patting him down.“What the hell, Rock?” Officer Lucas demanded.“That’s Carly’s. The only reason Carly’s phone would be under that cunt, is if she was running. Carly’s out here somewhere, and I think she’s running from her brothers,” Rock growled, his gaze sweeping the forest. Shit, his girl was out here, maybe hurt, definitely scared, and Carly was running with no idea of where she was going. In the best conditions, the Black Hills were dangerous. Right now? They were lethal. The storm was abating, but it would remain hazardous for a while as the land settled.“Which way?” Rock asked, twisting his head.“Rock, we can’t leave him,” Officer Lucas said.“No, you can’t leave him; we can. That fucker had my girl. I’m looking for her. He can fuckin’ drown for all I care,” Rock said, and Lucas stared at him and decided.“You three go on ahead; I’m following these three down. If this man’s a criminal, I can’t leave them alone with him. Keep your radio on you and radio your position every five minutes, you agree, or you don’t go,” Lucas demanded, and they nodded.“Let’s go find Carly,” Rock said and began walking.◆◆◆ I crawled under an overhang that had fronds trailing, hiding it, and camouflaged my figure from anyone tracking. The truth was, I needed to start a fire, but everything was soaking wet, and plus, it would lead Otis to me. To keep warm, I huddled under the ledge and rubbed my hands up and down my legs. My fingers were turning blue, and I was sure my waterlogged boots were making my toes the same. But hey, I’d rather lose a finger or toe than lose my life. The storm was on its last legs, having finally blown itself out, and I shoved my mess of hair out of my eyes and tried to get my bearings.For a few moments, I allowed myself to imagine a roaring log fire, thick woollen blankets and thick, cosy socks. Then reality bit as Otis stumbled into view. He was shouting and cursing, and I realised Otis was trying to track my footprints. Damn it, I should have learned. Cautiously I slipped out from the ledge as Otis faced away from me and towards a cliff face.Without heed or caution, I raced away, knowing Otis still held that gun. It took Otis a few moments to discover my whereabouts, and when the weapon spat, I knew he was behind me. The fact he didn’t gain on me meant Otis was injured because I was not moving swiftly. Heart in my throat, I ran as best as I could through the foliage, scratching my legs and arms and not caring. Better them than the consequences should Otis catch me. I tripped over a tree root that the recent rain had uncovered and tumbled down a steep incline. Landing at the bottom winded me, and I banged my head hard. I wasn’t sure if I had the strength to continue. The cold was too insidious, and bone-weary tiredness claimed me. My will, focus, and strength drained from me, and I lay there, dazed and lost.Minutes ticked by, hell hours may have ticked by, I’ve no idea, but a hand sank into my hair and began dragging me away from where I lay. It was Otis, but I didn’t have it to fight anymore. Due to the slickness of the mud, I was dragged easily backwards as Otis spat and swore at me. Otis was threatening nasty things, and I let it go over my head. Too tired, I couldn’t fight Otis now. I was frozen to the bone and worn out. But when I grew warmer and regained my strength, he’d be a eunuch before the night ended.Otis scrambled heedlessly in the mud, forcing rocks loose and tiny plants to come free. I tried to warn him to be careful, but as usual, my idiot brother didn’t use the brains that God gave him. A small rock hit me on the head, and I swallowed mud before gagging and spitting it out. I heard a slight rustle and knew Otis was disturbing the loose ground.“Are you so determined to kill us both?” I cried, and Otis howled.“You, yes. God damn you, Carly. All you had to do was spread ya legs and let Hans fuck you. Why was that so fuckin’ hard for ya? Oh, miss, high and mighty, always wanting better than where she came from. Just one fuck Carly,” Otis hollered.“This is my body. What right do you have to sell it?” I yelled as best I could.“Every right, we fed and clothed you,” Otis spat.“And Mom and Dad fed and clothed you, so should they have sold your virgin ass to a pervert?” I yelled.“I’m a man, worth more than a cunt,” Otis screamed. My hand grasped a rock, and I swung it upwards at him, smashing him in the kneecap. Otis fell on top of me, crying.“If I’m going to die, so are you!” I shrieked and hit Otis with the rock again, smashing his thigh. I kicked against his body and raked his face, and scrambled backwards.“You fuckin’ cunt!” Otis roared, trying to get to his feet.“Asshole, I hate you; I hate you!” I screamed and threw the rock. Wherever this surge of energy came from, I thanked it as I pulled myself up the steep slope.“Carly!” Rock bellowed, and I froze in shock, looking around for him.“Rock!” I screamed back, trying to see him. The rain had stopped, but night was approaching fast. I saw a flash of yellow from the peak above me, and I squinted. There, there were three beautiful figures in bright yellow.“Carly, get out of there. The grounds not stable,” Rock yelled.“No shit, Sherlock,” I muttered as I moved sideways.“Carly, we’re rappelling down. Get to a safe spot,” Drake called.“There isn’t one,” I called back. The third man shone a torch, seeking somewhere for me to climb to.“Carly, that big oak tree there, move towards that. The roots will be too deep in the ground to be pulled free, and it’s at the edge of the slide,” Dylan Hawthorne called.“Okay,” I said and turned ninety degrees to crawl towards the oak tree. The men above me kept doing what they were doing when Otis fired his gun at me. I yelped and dropped flat, face first in the mud, and my body went stiff, expecting pain. When no pain was forthcoming, I lifted my head and gazed at Otis with hate. A loud sound boomed off the hills, and I stared in horror as Rock, Drake, and Hawthorne dived to one side. To the left of the peak, they’d been standing on, came yet another mudslide, screaming and roaring as it drove towards me.This slide had me dead to right in its sights, and I struggled to reach the oak tree. Otis seeing my direction, moved that way too, but I beat him to it and tried to climb up its branches. The bark was too slippery, and I couldn’t catch hold. Rock’s horrified scream echoed in my ears, and the deluge swept me away. Otis gave a hoarse shout as he was smothered.I’d never felt so helpless as I struggled against the flood and tried to find a grab hold somewhere. My body was battered as I rolled and flipped in the fast-moving water and mud. I clawed for purchase while trying to keep my head above ground. With a jarring body slam, I crashed into something hard and spun in a different direction. The image of Rock roaring in horror was seared into my mind as I banged into heavy debris multiple times. Finally, my battered body fetched up against something.On instinct, I scrabbled for a hold and got my fingertips into a small crevasse. On instinct, I hauled myself closer, my heart pounding as the roaring of the flood surrounded me. My knees smashed into the tree, and I cried out and swallowed mud. Furiously, I spat it out and hooked an arm over the lower branch of the tree. Shit, it didn’t seem as sturdy as the oak I’d initially aimed at. No time for doubt, however, as the water swirled around me. I drew in a breath and, with a surge of energy, hauled myself further up the tree, but my waist and bottom half were trapped in the mud.But it didn’t matter how hard I tried to kick my legs free or pull myself clear of the sucking mud; I was truly trapped. Pins and needles shot down my bruised and cut legs, and I gave up fighting and chose to trust in God. Horrible smells from the debris milled around, making me want to gag. Fearfully, I understood that if I released this final lifeline, I’d be dead. There was no coming back from the deluge. The force would sweep me downstream, and I’d drown. A yell came from close by, and I gazed in horrified amusement as Otis was swept near me.His hand reached out, and I stared into his eyes. There was no inner voice, no little angel or devil on my shoulder. I held his gaze and denied him the lifeline Otis sought. Together we both understood that I only needed to reach out a hand and haul Otis to safety. Not today, not ever. Otis was a massive piece of shit, and I wouldn’t mourn him. Holding his scared eyes, I clung tighter to my tree and watched him as Otis was swallowed up, screaming.“See ya, asshole, may the devil take your soul,” I gasped. I don’t know how long I clung to that tree. My arms cramped, and the pain was a welcome relief from the cold and fear. Life would be far easier if I just let go. Because everything bad would float away and disappear in a few short minutes. I was facing a world of pain recovering, and it was tempting to let go.“Carly, hang in there!” Rock ordered, and even in my dazed state, I jumped. His voice echoed around the canyon, and I dully realised he’d used a bullhorn. It was the only way I could have heard him. The roaring water was too loud. Interested, I idly wondered how he’d save me from this mess. Fight rose in me, the will to fight for our life together, for our future children, for the promises we’d made each other. Fuck no, I wasn’t letting those go when they were within my grasp.Minutes ticked by, punctuated by the three men taking turns to call out encouragement to me as I clung to my little tree. Idly, I wondered how they’d reach me; the fast-moving water had slowed, but it was so very unsafe still. It was impossible to turn my head and see what they were doing and to be honest, it would take energy away from clinging to my position.Finally, I heard splashing sounds and frowned. What could be splashing near me? A yellow boat appeared in the corner of my eye, and I twisted my head a tiny little bit, and my eyes widened as Drake appeared in a yellow dinghy. It was attached to several ropes stopping it from sweeping past me as Drake battled to reach me. The mudflow had stopped, but now water flooded the surrounding area. The look of sheer determination to reach me on Drake’s face made me gasp. With a mighty heave, Drake paddled the dinghy, and it bumped against my tree.“Hold me in place,” Drake roared and turned to me. Drake fitted a safety harness to himself and attached it to the boat, and leant towards me.“Drake,” I stuttered.“Hold on, baby, you got to listen to me. I’m gonna bring this in closer, once I do, you keep holding on tightly until I get a harness around you. As soon as the harness is safe, I’ll tell you to let go. I know it’s going to be hard to trust me, but Carly, as soon as you let go, I’ll have you here safe,” Drake said. I listened intently and nodded.“Easy to trust you,” I said, and I saw my words touched Drake. He gave me one of his trademark chin lifts and moved the dinghy closer. I watched as Drake checked he was secure, and then he leant over the edge and fitted a harness around my waist. Drake couldn’t get it over my shoulders but secured it as best as he could.“Carly, let go and fall into my arms,” Drake ordered, and I didn’t hesitate before letting go. Strong arms caught and hauled me towards the dinghy. There was a moment of hard pulling, and Drake heaved me into the boat, and I collapsed on the floor. Drake yanked a thermal silver blanket out of a packet and tucked it in around me. As I lay there helplessly, Drake checked my vitals and dropped a kiss on my mucky head.“Carly’s safe; pull us back,” Drake roared and tucked me into his body as he used a paddle to guide debris away from him. Rock and Dylan pulled the dinghy to them, fighting against the current, but finally, they pulled it up safely to where they were.“Carly’s going to need carrying out. I couldn’t discern any life concerning injuries, but she’s hypothermic and has many cuts and bruises. Carly’s got a couple of head wounds, and I’m worried about her fingers and toes,” Drake summed up as Rock checked me over briskly. I was happily wavering between blackness and warmth.“Rock, get the backboard; don’t know if there’re any injuries to her spine. I’ve radioed in that we’ve a victim coming in, and EMTs are on standby for when we get out of here,” Dylan said. My gaze swapped between the three men barking orders. Rock’s large hand lightly touched my forehead and then cupped my face, and I gave up and closed my eyes and let the darkness swallow me.",

      "title": "Chapter 17",
      "content": "Chapter Eight.I was definitely unamused at the sound of voices angrily discussing my condition over my pounding head. Clearly, Rock, Drake, Doc Paul and Doc Gibbons were loudly disagreeing with something that concerned me, judging by the number of times my name was being used.“Shut up, please!” I groaned as the two little dwarves inside my skull struck hammer blows that would kill a lesser being.“Carly!” Rock exclaimed, and his hands cupped my face and jerked it gently. My stomach rebelled, and I just rolled to the side of the bed in time, where I heaved. There is nothing worse than vomiting on an empty stomach.“Shit,” Rock muttered, less sure of himself. Shit, indeed. My body stopped heaving, and I rolled back and glared balefully at the four men.“My head hurts,” I croaked. Doc Gibbons stepped forward.“Hello, young lady, by your hand is a button. Push it when you need pain relief.” Doc Gibbons kindly instructed.“Okay,” I whispered, pressing the button. Moments later, my headache eased, and I gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, thank God.”“How are you feeling?” Doc Paul asked, approaching the bed.“Like I got hit with a mudslide?” I quipped and was met with two dark scowls. “Too early to be joking?”“Definitely. My fuckin’ heart stopped when I saw you clinging to that tree,” Rock said, and I sensed the restraint he was employing at staying calm.“How severe are my injuries?” I asked.“Nothing is broken, so that makes a pleasant change, but you are black and blue from head to toe. You’ve had several large cuts stitched and you’ve got a sprained wrist. We’ve put you on strong antibiotics because of the mud you swallowed, or you may have possibly infected cuts. To be honest, Carly, you look and probably feel a mess,” Doc Gibbons said, and I winced.“Yeah, I do feel pretty banged up. Every muscle hurts to move,” I admitted. Rock placed a hand over mine and pressed the button. Unamused, I wanted to scold him but knew Rock only did it out of concern. For Rock, it must have been completely horrifying seeing me clinging to the little tree. I don’t know which was worse, living or watching it. Rock’s haunted face crossed my mind, and I winced. I never wanted to see that look on him again. The expression had been terrible to behold. The anguish on Rock’s face, the knowledge he couldn’t reach me and was failing me. Of course, to me, Rock hadn’t failed. It had been an incredible miracle that he’d found me.“How, how did you find me?” I whispered. Rock held my head up and held a glass to my lips, and I sipped.“Gunshots were reported by another team. We were closest to investigate, although we hadn’t heard them over the roaring of the creek,” Drake explained. Poor Drake, he looked worn out.“Team?” I asked, trying to play catch up.“The mountain rescue teams Carly, you know Rage are a part of them,” Rock said, and I remembered. Mountain Rescue was something Drake strongly believed in, and according to Silvie, Rage joined the moment they were clean. A way of paying back to the community that they’d disrespected one way or another when under Bulldog’s control.“Yeah, I ‘member,” I mumbled as my eyes drifted closed.“The others are still out there pulling people to safety,” Drake explained, and I tried to nod, but my eyes drooped. Sleep settled over me; I was safe in the knowledge Rock was here, and everything was perfect.◆◆◆ “No one from Rage was injured?” I asked Silvie, who was sitting at my bedside. Twenty-four hours had passed after the great rescue, and I was far more awake than I had been.“No, a cop and firefighter were hurt, and two tracking dogs saved their teams when they sensed danger. One dog was injured, hauling his team to safety before they realised what he was barking at. A freaking bear had been disturbed by the floods and was confused and angry. The dog managed to save the entire team, which makes him a hero,” Silvie said, smiling.“Oh bless,” I said and shifted. My right side felt as if someone had taken a giant cheese grater to me and rubbed me raw.“But our guys are still out there; many stranded people need help. The creek completely overflowed and has caused a lot of damage. The flood’s been labelled a disaster, and the governor’s called for help. Phoe’s flown in supplies, and the hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with injuries, minor and large.”“And deaths?” I asked quietly.“Twenty-seven so far, two children,” Silvie said sadly. “The Chief says the count will climb higher. They are expecting three figures.” In horror, I gasped and shook my head.“No!” I denied.“Yes, reports say six inches of rain fell from the skies, adding to the heavy rainfall this past week. All in all, reports are saying that over the last week over ten inches of rain has fallen. It just collapsed the flood defences, overran the dam, which was already high and… jeez, Carly. Dozens of homes are gone, and the missing is in triple figures,” Silvie said with tears welling in her eyes.“Where are the old ladies?” I asked.“At the front line, helping wherever they can. Serving food, drinks, handing out blankets and so on. All the children are at Reading Hall, Phoe called in her security team, and the older kids are looking after the younger ones. Micah and Jodie wanted to help, but Phoe begged them to watch the kids, so they freed up the old ladies. Willow, Rosie, and Serenity are helping at the Hall.”“Silvie, I’m surprised they made it to the Hall,” I said. I thought that Nemo Road, off of South Canyon Road, would have flooded too.“No, South Canyon Road is fine; there’re trees down and a few boulders in the roads, but the elder kids got the smaller ones to the Hall just fine. The roads where the creek has burst are badly affected. Flood defences have failed everywhere. No that’s wrong, flood defences held for the most part, but the creek overflowed in other places. Shit’s a mess out there.”“Silvie, the teams? How long are they out there?” Silvie’s face scrunched. Shit, I didn’t like that look.“The teams were pulling twelve hours shifts searching,” Silvie said slowly.“Spit it out,” I demanded.“Rage, Hawthorne’s and the RCPD refused to come in and camped out in the Hills. They were at breaking point when Chief Hawthorne forced them to return. Idiots were out for thirty-six hours,” Silvie said and made a moue with her mouth. Crap, I agreed. Those teams would push themselves, thinking they had stuff to prove.“What’s the damage at, monetary wise?” I asked. Silvie winced.“At the moment, they’re saying twenty million, they’re expecting it to double the next twenty-four hours and possibly even triple. The flood carried into town, including the areas around Canyon Lake Park. It stopped just past Founders Park, and it’s gone as wide as Cedar Ridge townhouses, and there’s damage as far as the Arrowhead Estates. The creek burst its bank in multiple places.The flood alert system got the warning out, they evacuated many people, but some refused to leave their homes. Rescuers are fighting on multiple fronts, flood control, debris, homeless, shoring up the remaining flood defences. The National Guard has arrived, and more are incoming. Red Cross is actively setting up refuge areas, and help is coming from local states. The area flooded is huge; rescue workers are working themselves to the bone,” Silvie sighed. And I guessed Silvie meant those closest to us as well. That made sense. Rage had a dedicated sense of community, and so did their old ladies.“Hellfire?” I croaked, knowing that Rage’s brother club wouldn’t be far behind them.“They’re here and on teams,” Silvie replied.“Who’s with Harley?” I asked.“Carly, we’ve been struggling; I’m going across to him in a moment,” Silvie said.“Can I share Harley’s room?” I asked, and Silvie shrugged. “Look, I’m not going anywhere you said for a couple of days. So I can share with Harley, and then we can free up the person due to sit with him. Even when discharged, I can still sit with Harley, as I won’t be good for anything else,” I argued.“That makes sense and would ease the worry off everyone,” Silvie said. “Let me grab a nurse.” Two hours later, I was parked in a bed in Harley’s private room, and my belongings had followed. Worried, I told Silvie to go and picked up the latest book that was being read to Harley. I sniggered as I saw it was Frankenstein. Opening the cover, I began reading it to the boy that had two MCs dancing around him.◆◆◆ It was dark when I smelt something nasty, and I opened my eyes and spied Rock standing beside my bed. Dear God, he smelt awful and looked shattered, but his gaze was firmly focused on me.“How are you doing?” I asked, hauling myself up in bed and wincing as I did so. My head was fuzzy, but I knew Rock needed me right then.“Shit, baby,” Rock said and stepped backwards, “smell like shit too.” Well, I couldn’t deny that.“This room has our own private shower; do you have a change of clothes?” I asked, and Rock nodded and pointed to a bag.“Yeah, I got eight hours downtime, Chief insisted.”“Shower and come to bed,” I whispered, glancing at Harley, who hadn’t stirred. Rock hesitated, and I saw sorrow in his eyes.“What happened?” I whispered. Rock swallowed hard, and panic rose.“Dragged three babies out of a flooded house; we were minutes too late for their parents,” Rock said hoarsely, and I saw the abject misery in his eyes. Sadly, I automatically reached out to him. Rock hesitated, no doubt aware of his foul odour, but I leaned forward to grab him. Rock came willingly into my arms. Hoarse sobs broke from Rock, and I hugged him tightly. I ran a hand through Rock’s hair and down his back and back up again while holding him tightly against my badly bruised ribs.Yeah, it freaking hurt. But who cared when Rock was in so much pain? And worse of the worse, hauling dead parents from a house. Rock sobbed, but it was so heartbroken I wondered if he’d be haunted by the failure to rescue the parents in time. There was so many needing help and so few to help. The teams couldn’t be everywhere, and Rock had to understand that. But my heart hurt because Rock hurt.And it proved how much Rock needed, loved, and trusted me. This man had been an oak tree alone for years, silent, stern, gruff, arrogant, but he felt so profoundly. Rock projected a wall that was so high not even a high jumper could breach it. He was aptly named Rock, strong and durable but will crack under the right pressure. And the pressure of this dreadful storm and flooding, the mudslides and flooded homes, damaged property and innocent lives lost was the crack that opened into a crevasse.Calmly, I rocked him back and forth in my arms as Rock clung to me like I was his lifeline. Rock buried his head in my neck, and I held him there, allowing his hot tears to scald me. The door opened, and Drake entered, appearing as every bit as broken as Rock. Drake collapsed in the chair next to Harley and stared at his son. Every ounce of pain was clearly etched into Drake’s face as he contemplated Harley. Rock’s tears slowed, and he wiped his eyes and lifted his head.“Go shower,” I whispered, and Rock nodded without even glancing at Drake. Rock bent and grabbed his bag and disappeared. “Drake, come here,” I ordered, but I don’t think he heard me. I repeated my words and saw the same misery in Drake’s eyes as he finally glanced at me.“Don’t make me get out of bed Drake, I don’t think I can, but I will certainly try,” I threatened. Drake rose to his feet and trudged over to me. Shit, Drake smelt even worse than Rock, but I sucked it up as Drake sat on my bed and silent tears ran down his face. I folded Drake into my arms and offered comfort as the huge, strong, amazing president of Rage cried like a baby. Rock was aware of what was happening because he stayed in that tiny bathroom.Drake clung to me, holding me tightly and possibly adding more accidental bruises. But that was okay because Drake needed someone to hold him, not to speak or offer false comfort. Just to let Drake deal with his emotions and pain and be his sponge. Soak it up so Drake could go back out in eight hours and repeat his actions of today. I’d mention therapy to Phoe when we next spoke.“The youngest was two Carly, fuckin’ two, clinging to her mother. If we’d got there half an hour earlier, the parents would be alive,” Drake said on a choking sob.“And how could you have got there earlier? What were you doing beforehand?” I whispered into Drake’s ear.“Was hauling a woman and two children out of a car that was swept away; they’d been there two days barely hanging on,” Drake muttered.“So you’d have left that family to die?” I asked, knowing there was no way Drake would have considered leaving them. Drake shook his head. “Sometimes Drake, there is no right or wrong, no easy way, choose one route and innocents die, choose another, the same happens. That woman and her children are alive because you and Rock got to her. Those parents, it’s an awful tragedy but not yours to carry. It’s Gods; it was his will you saved that woman and her children. His will that he called the parents to him. God knows you’re strong enough, Drake, to handle this, or he wouldn’t have dealt you this hand,” I said.“Didn’t think you were religious,” Drake muttered, wiping his eyes.“Sometimes I go to church, and I believe in God. And Drake, if Rage couldn’t reach those parents, no one could have. Shit’s as simple as that,” I whispered, stroking the harsh planes of his face and soothing worry lines.“Gonna haunt me, babe; the kids were clinging to their parents crying,” Drake said.“Yeah, but you’re a good man, Drake, and you’ll make peace with this. It will just take time,” I whispered, and he nodded.“Thanks, babe, I couldn’t take this home to Phoe,” Drake said and wiped the last tear from his face. Rock exited the bathroom, and Drake, studiously keeping his face averted, stumbled to the bathroom and disappeared. Rock didn’t say a word but dropped his bag and climbed into bed with me. He wrapped himself around me and fell straight to sleep. By the time Drake finished, Rock’s gentle snores were echoing off the walls. I told Drake to take the daybed and laid down holding Rock tightly.When I woke the following day, Rock and Drake were gone. But I felt more able to move my body and got out of bed and showered, and climbed into a chair. Those minor tasks sucked my energy away, and I picked up Harley’s book and began reading to him while holding his hand. I was so tired and engrossed in the story, I almost missed it. A faint twitch in my hand. Surprised, I held my breath as I looked up and focused on Harley. His face was impassive, peaceful, and his eyes were shut. A slight frown crossed my brow, and I bent my head and began reading again, and the twitch happened a second time, stronger now.“Harley?” I whispered, gazing at the boy. His eyelids flickered, and his eyes moved behind his lids. “Oh my God, Harley, open your eyes if you can hear me!” Minutes ticked by, the clock loudly announcing each passing second. Then a third twitch and Harley’s hand squeezed mine tightly.“Oh my God, Harley!” I cried. “Open your eyes, beautiful boy!” I demanded, and his eyelids fluttered as he struggled to obey. And then suddenly, I was staring into his confused, soft brown eyes. Harley moved his head as if searching his surroundings, and a lock of ash blond hair fell over his face. I swept it away and pressed the button for the on-call nurse.“Harley, stay with me, stay with me. It’s Carly. Do you remember me?” I babbled frantically. Harley’s mouth moved, and in a croak, said one word.“C… C… C… Carly.”“Yes, it’s me, it’s me. Harley stay awake honey, where is that damned nurse?” I gasped, pressing the button frantically. A nurse strode in, disapproval on her face as she opened her mouth to berate me for being impatient.“Harley’s awake!” I yelled, and she turned a surprised gaze on the boy staring at her.“I’ll call the doctors,” she said and hurried out the door. Overwhelmed, I fumbled for the replacement phone Silvie had brought me and finally managed, with shaking hands, to hit the call button.“Phoe!” I shrieked, deafening her. “Harley’s awake. He’s awake!” I yelled and burst into emotional tears.◆◆◆ The room had been chaos ever since I hit the nurse button. Doc Paul arrived within minutes, swiftly followed by Harley’s neurosurgeon and several other specialists. Harley remained confused, his hand clinging tightly to mine as he was poked and prodded and questioned. I knew it would take time for Phoe or Drake to arrive, and I was closest and assumed the role of Harley’s protector. Obviously, he’d no idea what was happening, and their questions made Harley even more confused.“Enough!” I finally snapped at everyone. “Harley hasn’t a clue what’s going on, and you’re overwhelming him. Leave until his parents get here so they can explain.” Doc Paul agreed and ushered everyone out, despite several doctors trying to overrule him.“Carly,” Harley stuttered.“It’s okay, honey. I know things are confusing. But you’re in the hospital, and Phoe and Drake are on their way,” I whispered, smoothing his hair away from his eyes.“What happened?” Harley asked hoarsely.“You had an accident, but everything’s going to be fine. We’ll move heaven and earth to make it right, Harley. I know you have questions, but let’s wait for them, okay? Fuck, I’m so relieved to see you awake,” I said.“How long?” Harley muttered, and I realised he wanted to know how long he’d been asleep. How do you tell a teenager he’d been unresponsive in a coma for over a year? Unfortunately, I didn’t have the conversation skills to drop that bombshell on him.“Just wait for your mom and dad, ay Harley?” I said. The door flew open, and Rock took up the space, his eyes focused on Harley. Rock’s face was pale, and his eyes searched the boy from head to toe before drifting back to his face.“Fuck me, son, you don’t realise how much we needed a miracle today,” Rock rumbled and strode forward to gather Harley gently in his arms. Tears pricked my eyes as Harley tried to lift his arms to hold Rock, but he lacked the strength to cling to him. Rock didn’t give a shit and held the boy as, for the second time in a day, I watched tears leak from his eyes. He dashed them away and gently settled Harley back on the bed. Rock’s hands fluttered over Harley, unsure what to do, and settled on holding Harley’s hand.“How you feeling, kid?” Rock asked.“Confused,” Harley stuttered. His eyes kept flicking towards the door.“Phoe and Drake will be here soon. I was closest to the hospital, as I was on my way back with a… friend.” Rock changed the last word. A victim is what Rock had planned to say before he choked the word off. Harley caught the slip, and a frown crossed his forehead. Despite Harley’s confusion from his coma, his mental capacities functioned just fine.“Trouble?” Harley stammered, and Rock gave a sharp nod.“A storm, bad one, Harley, but you don’t need to worry,” Rock reassured him.“Injured,” Harley asked, nodding at me.“Yeah, I had an accident, Harley, so have to stay awhile. I thought we’d be roomies,” I said and nearly leapt out of my skin. The door slammed open, and Phoe rushed through, her eyes wild and hair crazy mad where she’d been tugging at it. Her hand flew to her mouth as she spied Harley awake and staring at her.A wounded cry left her mouth, and she flew forward, shoving Rock out of the way and gathered her son. Rock grunted and stood behind her as broken sobs left Phoe’s mouth as Harley stared at us with confused eyes. Phoe’s hands touched his hair and back frantically, assuring herself Harley was awake, and her tears soaked his gown.“My boy,” Phoe sobbed, clinging tightly.“Phoe, Harley doesn’t know what’s happened,” I murmured in her ear. Phoe gave a nod to inform me she’d heard and took a couple of deep breaths. The door slammed open a third time, and Drake stood there, face haggard but full of hope. It took Drake seconds to cross the room and scoop his son and wife in his arms. For the second time in twenty-four hours, I witnessed Drake cry.I motioned to Rock to get me out of there. Drake and Phoe needed privacy, and I felt like a voyeur. Rock stepped outside and returned with a wheelchair, and I slipped into it, and Rock wheeled me from the room. As I left, I heard Drake’s deep voice rumbling reassurances to his family.◆◆◆ “How is it out there today?” I asked. Three days had passed since the storm, and I imagined it was more recovery than a rescue effort. Rock’s face was tight, the years piled on him, and he was bone tired.“Bad, we’ve still got rescues high in the Hills and roads are cut off. There’re survivors, and we’re pulling them in still, but the body count is rising. Last figure was near two hundred.” Rock stated baldly. I winced and lifted a hand to take hold of his.“When the crisis has ended, we’re going on vacation. We’re finding somewhere away from this with a cosy cabin and lots of sex,” I said, and Rock bit out a laugh.“That what you want, baby?” Rock asked.“Yeah, nothing fancy. Somewhere we can be alone and recover from these last few days,” I said.“We can do that,” Rock said and pushed me outside into the small garden the hospital kept for patients. Rock pushed me away from other patients and sat on the grass next to my chair.“Can I do anything?” I asked, reaching over for his shoulder.“Nah, baby, we know death comes with this job; it’s the… innocents we find hard,” Rock said, staring out at nothing. Swap innocents for children, I thought.“Miracles happen, Rock,” I whispered. Rock nodded, lost in thought, and I struggled out of the wheelchair and climbed into his lap. He wrapped arms around me and rested his chin on the top of my head. And we sat like that for several hours.◆◆◆ A week later, Rage was released from their rescue duties. Things resumed as normal on the forecourt and local businesses, except for their demeanours. Those who’d taken part, which was most of them, had a saddened, deadened look to them. The old ladies worried about how to manage this depression that had sunk over Rage. Phoe and Drake dealt with Harley and his recovery, thankful their boy was awake. Artemis spent so much time dragging Ace off for sex it was a wonder the man could walk. The upshot, however, was Ace improved because he was too damn tired to dwell on things.Marsha simply kidnapped Fish with the help of Texas and Axel and bundled him and their twins off on a long holiday. It was amusing watching Fish be hogtied and carried to their SUV. Silvie distracted Apache in much the same way as Artemis and Ace. Sin had taken Jett on vacation, and so had Lindsey with Lowrider. Ellen bundled Axel up in their cottage for two weeks, and Willow ended up bunking in a hotel.Penny had refused to bake anything for Texas unless he took her on a cruise, and Texas held out for twelve hours before Penny and the kids were whisked off. Gunner, Autumn and their brood toured Europe for a month. Sin dragged Jett off on a rare book buying tour for three weeks, leaving her beloved Reading Nook in her brother’s Reid’s hands. The other brothers found themselves packed off to various vacation homes that Phoe owned.I didn’t have any trouble; the moment I was released from the hospital, I scoured the web looking for a holiday I thought would suit us both. I ended up booking a three-week vacation to a ski resort in Austria. Rock seemed the type to enjoy winter sports, and I’d been right. He desperately needed the break Austria gave him. The lines faded from his face, and slowly his body relaxed as he began having fun.Until we left on vacation, Rock and I spent time with the three orphans that Rock and Drake had rescued. The State was trying to hunt a relative, but the two they’d discovered so far had been highly unsuitable. We spent hours with the two boys aged six and five and the little girl aged two. Rock worried about what would happen to them, and I fell in love with them, too. During the vacation, we face-timed them every day.The flood of Rapid City had caused millions in damage, and the cost of life had been high. Over three hundred dead, a campsite had lost fifty people alone when a flash flood had taken them unawares. But amid the tragedy, miracles occurred. Harley awoke, bringing much-needed relief to his immediate family and extended one. Phoe informed me how Chance, too, had cried when he saw his nephew awake and alert. Lex’s guilt finally disappeared. Not that Lex had anything to feel guilty about. He hadn’t been able to reach Harley in time to stop the bat from connecting with his head, but that wasn’t down to Lex.Rescuers from RCFD discovered a baby girl alive in a flooded house. Her mother barely breathing beside her, but they were alive. Two women had been rescued from a high tree they’d climbed, securing themselves with belts and ropes. Both women were severely dehydrated after five days of rationing the one water bottle they’d grabbed. A boat was discovered drifting aimlessly, and inside were five children from a different campsite whose boat had been thought lost in another flash flood. Their parents had survived and not given up hope. A car was unearthed several inches under a mudslide, and the family inside were alive.Despite the horrors the rescuers had seen, they’d also seen miracles too. Rapid City came together without anyone asking. Businesses that had survived when their rivals hadn’t, helped them begin to get back to a resemblance of normalcy. The entire HQ turned out, knocking door to door, for donations for homeless people. Phoe donated several million to a fund to get urgent supplies to the displaced survivors and paid for an entire hotel to be rented for six months for them.Ellen organised her school children into a food drive and then had them box up food parcels to be delivered. Sin and Reid spent a fortune sending out healthy lunches for two weeks for the rescuers who still searched. Shops donated items, and across the state of South Dakota, charity poured in. Little old ladies sat knitting blankets for children. The quilting clubs churned out duvets and other items. BlackRock Construction sent teams to shore up houses that could be saved until the owner’s insurance got on the job.Rapid City mourned and buried its dead and held memorials for the missing. It celebrated those who’d been saved and those who spent countless hours seeking anything with a sign of life. The local zoo and vets had rescued numerous animals, and donations had flooded in for them, too. The city came together in a way that meant the world to everyone involved. And I was proud to be part of that city, that wonderful caring city where we didn’t turn our backs on people in a time of crisis. And I was incredibly proud to call myself Rock’s old lady because, despite his rough and tumble ways, he was someone to be proud of. Something his stinking rich and arrogant family had no idea about.Meanwhile, Rock and I visited the three children and made sure they were safe and looked after. The children clung to us as some form of normalcy, while State looked for a decent relative to house them. I hated the thought of those babies ending up in foster care, and Rock did too. In fact, I hated it so much, I began asking myself silent questions that only I held the answer to.",

      "title": "Chapter 18",
      "content": "Chapter Nine.I lay back on the bed in the chalet and listened to Rock in the shower. When we’d come away, we’d not been able to bring the Shibari items, and Rock had been adamant about not having sex until I was fully healed. That was all well, good and kind, I suppose, but I was seriously horny. Today had been torturous, as we’d hit the hot tubs, and I’d wanted to leap on Rock there and then. If not for having people around, I would have jumped his bones hours ago.Now I lay stark naked, one hand playing with my breast and the other between my legs. One way or another, Rock was going to give me hot, fast and furious sex. The shower switched off, and I imagined Rock’s cock hanging heavily between his legs. My head tilted back with a groan as I became slick under my finger. The door opened, and I heard a sharp inhale of breath.Through slitted eyes, I watched as Rock stared in hunger, and my wetness doubled. Tense, I flicked my taut nub, and my hips moved as I sought release. If Rock wouldn’t join in, then I’d get my kicks from him watching. Hell, I didn’t care how I got them as long as I got them, and Rock watching made me even hornier. My back arched as I moaned in pleasure, and I felt the tenseness between my legs. My pussy cried out for relief, and my hand left my breast, and I slipped a finger inside me.Yeah, it wasn’t Rock’s cock, but it would do. My pace sped up as I heard a growl from the doorway, and a quick glance showed Rock had dropped the towel, and his cock was rigid. Rock’s eyes were narrowed, watching intently, and he took a step towards me. Seeing how I affected Rock, urged my passion to newer heights, and I cried out again as my muscles spasmed and clenched. With a shattering cry, I came and collapsed back on the bed. Seconds later, Rock lifted me up and collapsed on his back and pulled me onto him. Rock’s cock surged deep inside, and I yelled as I felt him thrust deeper.“Yes,” I cried as Rock held my hips and his own rocked against me. Pressure built again as he sought his release inside me. With a guttural cry, Rock surged, and I felt him spill. Rock thrust several more times and collapsed back against the bed. I felt cheated, but there was a wicked glint in his eyes. Without a word, Rock lifted me off him and sat me on the bed as he strolled into the bathroom and brought out a washcloth.He cleaned me carefully and threw the cloth to one side, and with a firm hand, he pushed me back onto the bed. Rock’s heavy muscled body covered me as he took my mouth in a claiming kiss. I wriggled under him, and Rock nipped my lip before taking control of my mouth. By the time Rock finished kissing me senseless, I was wet and panting harshly under him. Rock’s teeth nibbled on the lobe of my ear, a spot we’d discovered highly aroused me, and I dug my nails into his back. Rock’s content growl told me he knew what he was doing. This was punishment for making him watch. In revenge, my hand crept down and pinched his ass hard, and Rock jumped. One large hand gathered mine up and pinned them to the bed as his hips thrust against me.Rock’s mouth teased and taunted my nipples, offering glimpses of pain and pleasure in equal amounts, and I slipped a hand between us and cupped his cock. Rock loved the tip of it being teased, and I began moving a finger around the pearl of pre-cum he’d leaked. And his cock twitched in excitement.His mouth moved to my stomach, kissing the welts as he did every time we made love. I’d not yet had my tattoos done because of what had happened, but Rock had designed me several. Rock took his time loving and lavishing them with attention, and his finger slipped inside me, causing me to jerk. Rock’s mouth descended, and his tongue ran from my entrance to my nub. As soon as he touched it, I cried out and lifted my hips, and Rock pushed me back.Desire having flooded my veins threatened to drive me insane as Rock’s tongue did as he wished and drove me wild. Rock’s finger was joined by a second as he thrust into me, urging me to come. Rock withdrew his fingers, and both his hands held my hips, and I screamed in frustration. He now controlled me, and I couldn’t move against his mouth like I wished. Smugness hit me as Rock lavished attention on my nub and entrance, sliding his tongue in and out, using his broad shoulders to keep my legs far apart. My lack of control heightened my sensitivity, and with a scream, I came in his mouth.Rock milked me dry and rose above me, my dark devil, and slid inside me smoothly. The moment Rock did, my legs closed around his waist, driving him deeper into me. I loved the feeling of being impaled, and he thrust against me, grunts giving away his urgency. Rock’s pace fastened, and he pushed deeper, holding me tightly to him, and with a loud cry of his own, I felt him spill a second time. Rock collapsed sideways, rolling me with him, so I lay on top.“Fuck me, Carly, I’ll never get enough of you,” Rock muttered into my neck. Our bodies were slicked with sweat and evidence of our pleasure.“Me either, I need you like I need air,” I replied.“Good, because when I’m in your veins and all you can think of is me, I’m putting a ring on you,” Rock said, and my body went stiff.“A claiming ring or wedding ring?” I whispered, unsure of the meaning.“Only one ring matters,” Rock said, letting his head fall back onto the pillows.“Wedding?” I asked, unsure still. Rock opened his eyes and gave me a “duh” look, and I had my answer.“Ain’t no other ring worth mentioning,” Rock said and reached over to clean us both. With a happy noise, Rock tucked me into his side and held me tightly. My leg crept over his to hold Rock tightly, and I dozed off, safe and sound, with a man who’d go to hell and back to keep me safe.◆◆◆ “Hans Smidt is claiming a breach of contract,” Ramirez said, shaking his head in disbelief. Hans hadn’t woken until we got back from our vacation, and Ramirez had arrested him yesterday.“Are you for real?” I asked in disbelief. Ramirez nodded his head.“Afraid so, Carly. Claims your brother signed a deal giving you to him,” Ramirez said, and Rock growled.“Does Smidt know you can’t buy a human being?” Rock asked.“Yeah, but that’s what Smidt’s going with, fuckin’ unbelievable. Can’t believe his asshole lawyer isn’t telling Smidt we can charge him with human trafficking as well as,” Ramirez replied and gave a grim chuckle.“Tonio, you throwing the book at Hans?” I asked, holding Rock’s hand for reassurance.“Fuck yes, Carly. We don’t want this shit in our city. Bastard crossed state lines as well. Asshole’s going down girl, you don’t need to worry. We recovered the body of your brother,” Ramirez said. Unconcerned, I shrugged.“And? Throw Otis on the trash heap. Any sign of Elrond and Chester?” I asked. Otis was the ringleader, but the others were as mean as rattlesnakes. And I didn’t much enjoy the idea of looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.“No, we’ve sent locals out to inform them of Otis’s death, but they weren’t there. RCPD informed Barney, but there’s not much he can do from behind bars.” Ah yes, the judge had denied Barney bail for my attempted kidnapping.“Don’t care, Otis can rot on a compost heap. Tonio, I’m not claiming Otis. Do you need another statement?” I asked. Ramirez shook his head.“Just be ready to testify in court, honey. Your twat-head brother plans to fight this shit. But Barney and Smidt have been caught bang to rights.”“Okay, I was aware I had to testify, so not a problem,” I quipped lightly. Sure, I’d go to court, anything to free myself of my brothers. Now we just had to find Chester and Elrond because they were hiding somewhere. They weren’t clever, just typical inbred hillbillies, and I shook myself. Mom had come from a good background; it was Dad’s genes that had screwed them up. Luckily, I took after Mom.“Keep us updated?” Rock asked as Ramirez got to his feet.“Sure, if we spot Carly’s brothers, we’ll call,” Ramirez said agreeably and left the clubhouse.“Babe, I got to pop and check a project. Fancy coming?” Rock asked, and I nodded. I knew that he and Apache had several major projects going. They were converting the former small warehouse district to apartments and a decent suburb. Shops were being built to encourage people to move. They had also designed a park for children and were ensuring the new housing ran on green energy.Rock strode out of the clubhouse with me on his heels. Before Rock could even complain, I had jammed on my helmet. I didn’t get it; the brothers rode without helmets, but God forbid their old ladies did. Rock swung on to his Harley, and I climbed up behind him. Wrapping my arms firmly around his tight stomach, I laid my head on his back as Rock throttled the bike and pulled away. I loved the feel of the bike between my legs; power and sexiness rolled into one. Plus, I loved how intimate it was between Rock and me.No way could anyone say driving in a car was as intimate as this. We were joined as one as Rock steered the bike through the streets, heading out to the warehouse district. I’d guessed right when I saw where we were going. This area hadn’t been touched by the floods. It was on the other side, away from the Black Hills and instead overlooked the ranches that surrounded it. The countryside remained beautiful, framed by the mountains in the distance.Rock passed through a huge open gate with a big sign saying, ‘BlackRock Construction’, and rode towards a warehouse on the right. He parked up, and I climbed off and yanked my helmet off before gazing around curiously. I was surprised at what I’d found. From what I understood, the area was a real dump. It had been an eyesore for so long that the city sold it cheap.Now activity bustled around. There were thirty abandoned warehouses of various sizes. From what I saw, some were finished, others halfway done, and some were in original condition. The one we stopped outside was finished, and I gazed in a studied manner, taking in the difference between it and the others.The converted warehouse was medium-sized and two stories high. It had a brick facing and had been cleaned. The bottom level started with an entrance to the right, followed by two windows. It repeated the pattern until there were twelve doors. I guessed that meant either twelve apartments or condos.“Are they apartments or houses?” I asked.“Condo’s up and down and spacious inside. Carly, come and see,” Rock smiled, opening the door to the nearest apartment. Rock threw me a pair of booties to protect the flooring, and I shoved them on over my sneakers. We entered a hallway with stairs ahead of us. The floor was wooden, and the walls were a cool cream. Rock opened the door to my right, and I stepped into a large living room split into three sections. The following section held a dining table and behind that was the open-plan kitchen.“There’s under-stairs cupboard space and a downstairs cloakroom,” Rock said, opening two doors, and I peeked inside them. Both were generous spaces. Upstairs I discovered three bedrooms and another family bathroom.“Are they all like this?” I asked, meaning the space and décor. Each room was a calm cream, with wooden floors and high ceilings.“In this block, yes. We’ve changed details from block to block,” Rock said as he checked something in the bathroom.“I like them,” I said, smiling as Rock poked his head out. He smiled back.“Good,” Rock grunted and stepped out.“Are you doing the same layout with every warehouse?” I asked.“No, the one at the very centre we’re converting to units for shops. It will be the centre of the community, and it’s the largest warehouse here. The upper floor will be split into a community centre and other stuff. Some warehouses we’re making penthouses, other apartments and some into condos like those you just saw. We’ve got a large area cleared where a former warehouse was, and we’re making that a park.Some we’ll convert into a garage underneath with an apartment above. There’s been a lot of interest. But this housing is affordable; we’ve got plans in place to help people get back on their feet. And to help people who can’t get a mortgage due to blacklisting. While we have some penthouses and more expensive housing, it’s mixed in amongst this. We wanted to build a community, not another area to separate rich from poor.”“That’s a great idea,” I said as Rock led us outside and across the road and into another building. This was what Rock must have meant. The downstairs was outfitted as a garage, or it could be used as a workroom. There was a locked door which Rock opened, and we went upstairs into a large open-plan apartment. Two bedrooms and a bathroom were tucked away, and I nodded in approval at the living space.“Oh, I’d have liked this,” I said, giving my stamp of approval. There were lots of brickwork and metal beams, and enormous glass windows letting light stream in.“I prefer cosy.” Rock shrugged, and I glanced at him.“Yes, I do too,” I said, wondering if Rock thought I wasn’t happy at his Grandparents’ home.“Yeah, I know, baby, but this has its appeal,” Rock said, nodding. Rock pulled me around several warehouses, commenting on things with his team leaders and foremen. I was surprised to find each building had a team leader, and they reported to one of four foremen. Each foreman took a design, so penthouse, condo, apartment or the garage conversion. Finally, Rock seemed happy with what he’d seen, despite giving the men a list of tasks. We got back on the bike and headed towards the foster home where six-year-old Blake, five-year-old Harrison and two-year-old Bonnie were staying.We’d become very close to the kids over the six weeks since the flood, and to our sadness, no relatives had been found. The state was looking at adoption but keeping them together was going to be a massive task. When we arrived, we saw the child worker outside the house speaking to the foster mom. Ms Jones raised a hand in greeting.“Let’s put our names in the pot,” I said on impulse to Rock. Rock’s body tensed as I swung off the bike and faced him.“What?” Rock bit out.“Come on, we both love those kids to bits, and we have a home we can offer. Let’s get our name on the list to adopt them,” I insisted.“Fuck Carly, thought you wanted our own?” Rock asked, holding my gaze.“Yeah, but I don’t want to carry a child just yet, but it doesn’t mean we can’t love the terrible trio,” I replied.“Are you sure?” Rock asked.“Yeah.”“Let’s speak to Ms Jones,” Rock said, swinging off the bike and grabbing my hand. Ms Jones looked up with a smile as we approached at speed.◆◆◆ I was pulling weeds from the flower bed when Rock arrived home from work several nights later. I’d beaten Rock home because he’d gone to check on another job site. Dinner was cooking, and so I’d come out here to tackle the vegetable gardens his grandmother had planted. It was a thankless task; I’d realised after an hour. The beds were completely overgrown, and I was wrestling a particularly stubborn one when I fell backwards and landed on my ass. Rock stood behind me, laughing.“Oh shush you, can’t we hire Ezra?” I asked grumpily.“Already did, so don’t know why you’re weeding,” Rock said, chuckling.“You’re not funny, mister,” I said as Rock reached out a hand and took mine and hauled me to my feet.“Dinner cooking?” Rock asked, sniffing the air.“Yeah, southern fried chicken, salad, and homemade slaw. I also made bread,” I said, and Rock looked like he’d died and gone to heaven.“Man, I love homemade bread,” Rock said, and I nodded. Yup, I knew that, which is why I’d made it.“Want to go to the bar tonight?” Rock asked, and I shook my head.“No, I’d rather stay home if okay with you. Just chill out. Things were hectic in Made by Rage today,” I replied as we walked back inside, hip to hip.“Yeah, I heard Gunner had to be restrained before he brained someone,” Rock grunted, amused.“He was so angry! I don’t think I’ve ever seen Gunner that mad before,” I exclaimed, and Rock chuckled again.“Gunner’s quiet but has a temper. That dude insulted him and is lucky to have walked out.” Oh yeah, he had been. A customer had been looking through the Made by Rage window in the part of the shop that Gunner and Manny worked their magic. He’d banged on the glass several times to get Gunner’s attention and, when that didn’t work, loudly insulted him. Gunner had come out, and although his jaw had been clenched, he’d been polite, well, polite for Gunner.Once Gunner had denied the man’s request, things had turned nasty. The man insulted Gunner and Gunner got in his face. Which wasn’t a great idea for the customer, as Gunner held a mallet and chisel. Lex had raced over and shoved the customer out before Gunner shoved the chisel somewhere the man wouldn’t want it. Gunner had returned to work after a string of vicious insults and turned his music up loud, drowning any further distractions out.“Gunner was fuming,” I said as I washed my hands and turned to check on dinner.“Weren’t happy when Autumn arrived either. Autumn took one glance at him and told Gunner to get his ass to the bar and come home in a better mood,” Rock said, amused.“Autumn’s great for him,” I said, remembering how torn we’d been. Gunner had been with Silvie when Autumn exploded into his life. Honourably, Gunner had shoved his own needs and desires aside while he tried to make things work with Silvie. Although at the time, half of us wanted to smack Gunner round the back of his head, and the rest wanted to throttle him. But things worked out as they should. Gunner and Autumn were deliriously happy. Well, we assumed Gunner was as he offered a rare smile now and then.My thoughts turned to the latest couple, Silvie and Apache, and how happy they were. From being a complete Iceman where Silvie was concerned, Apache had turned into the Human Torch. Apache constantly kept a watch on his woman and spoiled her thoroughly. Not that Silvie was complaining. She’d gone without for many years, so being spoilt was a novelty for her. I was overjoyed to see Silvie happy.“Any news from Ms Jones?” Rock asked.“No,” I said, shaking my head. “Ms Jones said she was running our backgrounds and checking our references.”“Woman wants to move her fuckin’ ass,” Rock complained.“Red tape, honey,” I replied.“You got anything planned for tomorrow night?” Rock asked as he stole a piece of cucumber from the salad bowl.“No, and I’m so antsy at the moment I don’t know if I’m fit company,” I replied.“Fine, I’m booking Bernard’s for the five of us,” Rock said and stole another piece. I smacked his hand and missed hitting thin air.“Five?”“You, me and the kids,” Rock replied.“Any reason?” I asked.“Nope, just want to spoil my woman and the kids,” he said, grinning, and I laughed. There was a cheeky glint in his eye.“You have my permission to spoil me,” I teased.“Oh, I do, do I?” Rock said, moving around the island and pinning me against the worktop.“Well, I suppose I’ll have to take one for the team,” I giggled as Rock looked mock offended.“How about I give you one to take for the team?” Rock asked, and I snuck my arms around his neck.“Oh, if one must!” I whispered as Rock claimed my mouth. Dinner was burnt by the time we remembered it. Pizza it was!◆◆◆ A feeling of wrongness hit as I waved goodbye to Lindsey, who was staying late finishing a quilt. I’d offered to help, but the Rage gossip train was firmly in motion, and Lindsey waved me away, unconcerned. Mac was sitting with Lindsey chatting, and I nodded at both, reassured someone was with her. The strange feeling hit me as I stepped outside and looked around. Yes, something was most definitely off, and my gaze fell upon a car parked a little way up the road.A person was sitting in it, eyes firmly focused on the Rage forecourt. Quietly sneaking forward and keeping out the shadows, I peered around the corner and saw Blaze on the forecourt working on his bike. The man’s eyes were firmly focused on Blaze. Oh no, not Blaze, not by a freaking longshot! For a split second, I hesitated, wondering what to do, and snapped several photos of the car and man before looking for a weapon.Blow Rage for keeping everything so neat and tidy around the garage, I couldn’t see anything helpful. I crept back to Made by Rage and banged three times on the window, and Mac leapt the barrier and stared at me. Silently, I pointed at the car, and Mac frowned, and I mouthed Blaze while pointing to my eyes.Realisation dawned, and Mac drew his phone and sent a text and came out of the shop. Mac put a finger to his lips, and I nodded as he sent another text. Seconds later, Mac crossed the road at a jog, and I peeked at Blaze again. Blaze kept his head down, but his body was alert. Casually, Blaze straightened and swept a leg over his bike, acting like he was checking something. As I watched, Blaze started his motorcycle and roared the throttle. Moments later, a car screeched, and Mac yelled.“Watch out!” I plastered myself to the wall as the car sped past, and Blaze shot out after it. Mac was on his own bike moments later and gave chase as well. Rock came running from the clubhouse and stared at me.“Get inside!” Rock roared, and I jogged across the forecourt as Rock headed to Made by Rage. Minutes later, Lindsey was escorted inside to where Axel, Texas, and I stood.“Where is everyone?” I asked.“Drake and Phoe are at the hospital with Harley, and some are at work and others at the bar having an early drink,” Rock grunted. Sin scurried into the clubhouse, followed by Jett. Jett took off the moment Sin was inside, and I guessed he, too, was giving chase.“Never a dull moment,” Sin quipped, sinking into a chair. Rock sent her a black look, and she waved an airy hand at him.“Want a drink?” I asked, seeing how hot Sin looked.“Please, Carly, I have to pick the children up from HQ soon and would love a few minutes me time,” Sin said, and I checked her. She looked tired.“You been sleeping okay?” I asked as I fetched Sin, a chilled coke from behind the bar.“Yes, it was just crazy today, we’re running a promo on Lindsey’s new book, and everyone and their mother wanted one today,” Sin whined.“Oh?” I asked, tilting my head.“Yeah, I had Lindsey sign a load and offered them at RRP. The promo drove people in, and they bought lots of books. Luckily, I just had enough. There’s three signed copies left, so I thought I’d put them away for a prize draw or something,” Sin said.“How many did you sell?” I asked.“Two hundred,” Sin muttered.“Damn, I bet Lindsey had cramp after signing that lot,” I laughed.“No, I got her to do them over a couple of weeks. Hell Carly, I’m not that evil yet,” Sin grinned. “When Jett gets back, he can take us to Bernard’s.”“Why don’t you join Rock and me?” I offered, and Rock grunted. Oops, I wasn’t sure if that was agreement.“Sure, why not, usually we all spend time together. Sometimes it’s nice to spend time with one old lady at a time,” Sin agreed, and Rock pulled his phone and dialled Bernard.“Have you heard anything?” Sin asked, leaning towards me and whispering.“No, it’s awful this waiting shit. Rock goes from excited to sullen in the blink of an eye,” I replied.“Sorry, Carly, you and Rock must be on red-hot coals,” Sin said sympathetically.“Yeah, I wish we’d an answer, yes or no. Rock and I are invested in the kids,” I said. Sin reached over and patted my hand.“Remember, you have contacts if needed. Phoe, Antony, Andrew, you and Rock have a lot of sway if you need to use it,” Sin said.“Hope it doesn’t come to that,” I said and gazed at Rock.Jett, Mac and Blaze returned half an hour later, all three of them fuming, having lost the car when a damn truck pulled out in front of them. Blaze’s hair was rumpled from where he’d been yanking his fingers through it.“Did you get pictures?” Blaze asked, approaching me. I chucked him my phone, and he scrolled through them. “I can’t make out his face, but he’s familiar somehow.” Blaze said, sending the pictures to his phone.“Well, I didn’t want to be too obvious, Blaze,” I said, worried.“You did right, honey,” Blaze said and dropped a kiss on my head. “You going Bernard’s?” Blaze asked Rock.“Yeah, with Jett and family,” Rock replied. I was looking forward to it. Sin had been correct; we rarely did stuff like this.“My treat, our girl thought on her feet, and we have his car model and number,” Blaze said and threw Rock a card.“Don’t need it,” Rock said, throwing it back. Blaze caught it and launched it straight back at Rock.“Said my treat brother, for many things but for making my girl happy,” Blaze growled. Uh oh, Rock didn’t like Blaze calling me his.“Your girl?” Rock growled. Blaze squared up to Rock.“My girl, my best friend, my little sister, my girl,” Blaze’s tone clearly stated if Rock wanted to make something of it, Blaze was happy to rumble.“Fine,” Rock said, and I stared at him in disbelief. Rock met my gaze and smirked.“My bed you’re in,” Rock said proudly, and I rolled my eyes as Blaze groaned aloud. Rock had just found the ultimate revenge.“Come on, let’s eat!” I said and dragged Rock out of the clubhouse before Blaze found another way to rile Rock.◆◆◆ I was singing loudly and off-key when Rock approached home. It had been a fun meal, with Jett more talkative than usual, and Sin had teased him. Amelia was a happy little girl and Brooke was content to sleep on whoever would hold her. Our three had been a little unsure and shy at first, but Amelia soon wriggled her way into their hearts. We’d had a good time, and I’d been sad to see the evening end. While Rock was the eldest of us four, I didn’t believe age mattered much. Jett was his brother, and it hadn’t been an issue.Rock shook his head, and I climbed out of the car and pranced up our path. We’d dropped off the children half an hour ago, lavishing them with hugs and kisses. I opened the front door and walked in, kicking my shoes off and switching on the lights as I went. A bang sounded coming from the living room, and I thought Rock had gone there instead of upstairs where I’d been heading. Loudly calling Rock’s name, I marched back down and entered the lounge and froze as two guns turned in my direction. Chester and Elrond grinned at me.“Carly, baby, where you gone?” Rock called.“Get out!” I screamed, my vocals unfreezing.“No, come in,” Chester smirked, confident he’d the upper hand. Rock’s heavy boots stomped across the dining room, and he entered the lounge, taking in the situation at once.“Drop your weapon,” Elrond grinned. Rock frowned.“Ain’t armed,” Rock grunted. Chester rolled his eyes and pointed his gun at my head.“Three seconds, lover boy, and Carly gets a bullet straight between those pretty eyes of hers,” Chester said, grinning.“What are you doing, you fucking idiots?” I yelled at them, trying to give Rock time.“Two,” Elrond said, and Rock pulled his gun from behind his back and dropped it.“Kick it over,” Chester beckoned, and Rock did as he was told. I couldn’t believe this; I’d not noticed the door wasn’t locked when I opened it, and I’d led us into a trap.“What do you want?” Rock growled.“Our sister has to pay for what she did to our brothers,” Elrond sneered.“Seriously? Otis sold me, and Barney tried to kidnap me, and you’re blaming me?” I asked, astounded.“Yeah, you should have done as you were told,” Chester said and spat at me. I flinched back from his spittle as it just missed my face.“Leave my home now,” Rock rumbled, taking a step towards me. Elrond swung his gun around to aim at Rock.“Stay there,” I begged Rock.“Let Carly go,” Rock demanded, and Chester shook his head.“Carly has to pay. Family first, and she forgot that,” he said.“I was family, family you abused and beat. Have you forgotten that? You beat any loyalty out of me!” I yelled, terrified Rock would get hurt.“Poor Carly,” Elrond sneered, and I saw his eyes. Fuck, Elrond was high on something; this was a cluster fuck.“My brothers will come for you,” Rock threatened, and Chester turned to him.“And? You’ll both be dead, and we’ll be in the mountains. Ain’t no finding us if we don’t wanna be found.” Chester meant it. He planned to kill us both, and I recognised that mean look in his eyes. Chester was getting off on the power trip.“Who do I shoot first? Make him watch her die, or her watch him die?” Chester asked Elrond.“You got me, let Rock go; he’s innocent in this,” I begged, tears in my eyes.“Shoot him first,” Elrond said, “bitch will suffer more then.” Everything happened at once. I darted forward to tackle Elrond, who pointed his gun at Rock, and Rock dived on me from the side as two guns fired. I screamed and hit the floor as something hot pierced my shoulder. Rock landed hard on me and didn’t move, and I stared into Rock’s face as his eyes closed. A scream left me as I shoved him off, uncaring of my wound, and pushed Rock onto his back. Rock reached for his leg. A second bullet hit Rock as Chester fired a second time and danced around in joy.Anger flooded my veins as I patted Rock’s face, sobbing and calling his name. Rock’s eyelids fluttered and then stilled, and I checked for a pulse. Blood dripped down my hands as I found a faint pulse, so unlike Rock’s usual strong one.“Call an ambulance!” I shrieked, trying to cover Rock’s chest and stop the bleeding.“Not fucking likely, we’re gonna watch him bleed out,” Elrond cheered and high fived Chester. Hatred flooded me as I saw what Rock had been reaching for at his ankle. Sobbing, I pressed a hand against the nearest shot to Rock’s heart and slipped out the gun in his ankle holster. Without thinking, I aimed and fired, shooting Elrond straight between the eyes. Chester screamed as Elrond’s blood splattered his face, and he turned to me as Elrond toppled backwards.“I hate you!” I screamed, tears streaming down my face, and shot Chester in the nuts. Chester let out an unholy howl and grabbed his family jewels. A third shot came from his gun, and it grazed my head as Chester, screaming, aimed at Rock again. My gun came up, and I shot Chester straight in his head, much like Elrond.My hands scrabbled at my jeans, and I called 911, yelling for an ambulance as I tried to stop the bleeding from Rock. Rock’s pulse remained faint as I begged him repeatedly not to leave me. We were happy; how could this happen to us? We were planning to be a family with three children, and I wasn’t losing this. I wiped the blood from my brow and curled next to Rock, both my hands on his chest, trying to stop the bleeding and sobbing when he didn’t respond.",

      "content": "Chapter Ten.Drake heard Carly screaming before his ass had even cleared the doors. Animalistic howls and screeches echoed around the waiting room. Lindsey ran behind him, eyes wide with fear at the noise Carly was making. Drake rushed past a couple of nurses who were staring gobsmacked at a room and burst in, seeking Carly. Carly huddled near a corner covered in blood. Drake’s sharp eyes took in a wound on Carly’s shoulder, and a nurse and doctor were trying to get close. Lindsey crashed into his back and gasped. Carly was whiter than white, clearly injured and in shock.Her clothes were covered in blood, hers and Rocks, Drake guessed. Carly’s hands were held out in front of her, keeping the two medical staff away. She made little cries that were suddenly punctuated by a wild, loud one. Carly’s eyes were wild, and she kept glancing about, and she focused on Drake with laser intentness.“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed at Drake, lashing at him with pain in her voice.“Carly, baby,” Drake soothed, keeping his voice low pitched and calm.“No, no baby, they shot Rock, and then they took Rock!” Carly screamed, pointed at the doctor and nurse. Lindsey stepped out from behind, and Carly gazed at her.“Carly, come here,” Lindsey ordered gently. Carly shook her head and scuttled sideways, and backed herself straight into the corner. The door slammed open, and Lindsey was propelled into Drake’s side as Silvie burst through the door. Carly crouched low, her hands going over her head as she screamed. Silvie skidded to a halt and swapped a frightened gaze with Drake.“Carly, it’s me, it’s Silvie,” she soothed, trying to be heard over Carly’s cries. “Are you hurt, baby girl?”“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed, looking up at Drake. Terror flooded Carly’s face, and Drake swallowed hard.“Okay, but Rock’s in theatre now honey, you got him safe,” Silvie soothed, and Carly shook her head like a maniac.“No, I put Rock in danger. If not for my fucking family, Rock wouldn’t have been shot!” Carly cried, and tears tracked down her face. They made inroads in the dried blood on her face. Drake’s eyes narrowed, and he thought he saw a head wound. Damn, his girl wasn’t operating on all systems.“Carly, come to me,” Drake ordered, and Carly remained crouched, eying him suspiciously.“No, not until they get Rock,” she whispered malevolently, glaring at the doctor and nurse, who stood watching.“Honey, Rock’s having the bullets removed,” Silvie said gently.“They stole Rock from me,” Carly shrieked, and Lindsey winced. Drake was aware his brothers were outside, but no one entered. Carly was completely freaking out, and Drake understood why. She’d been shot in her shoulder and was favouring it. She looked to have other injuries, and she’d seen Rock gunned down trying to protect her. Taking a hard line wouldn’t work. Loudly shouting would make Carly freak even more and maybe even cause her to retaliate. Drake checked her over for signs of a weapon.“Carly, they’re fixing Rock up, baby. Now, why don’t you come here and let them fix you up?” Drake bartered. Carly cocked her head and then shook it firmly.“No!” she shouted. “Not until I know Rock’s okay. He’s gonna be okay, Drake, right? Rock will make it?” Carly’s begging broke Drake’s heart. He had to help her, help her through this and make Carly understand it wasn’t her fault. Drake knew she was blaming herself; the guilt was written across Carly’s face.“Rock will be just fine, baby,” Drake said softly.“I shot them in the head,” Carly spat, and her face turned evil and hateful. “I shot Elrond straight between the eyes and then Chester in the nuts. But Chester shot Rock again, and I shot him in the head. Bang, straight between Chester’s slitty eyes.” Drake felt pride rise in him. This girl, she was the miracle his brother had been waiting for. Carly was perfect for Rock, whether or not she realised it.“Rock would be proud, baby, that you defended yourself,” Drake said and stepped forward. Carly instantly moved to the side to avoid him. Her wild gaze was tearing him apart. Drake bled for the pain in her face and how Carly held her body defensively as if she expected Drake to hit her for endangering Rock. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, Drake just wanted to gather Carly up and soothe away her pain.“Rock will be fine, but he’ll want me to look after you,” Drake said, and Carly’s eyes latched onto his face, and Drake realised how to get Carly to obey. Damn him for using such a low trick, but if it got Carly, the help that she required, he’d do it.“Huh,” Carly said. Lindsey stepped forward, catching on quickly.“Rock won’t get better if he doesn’t know you’re looked after. Rock will want us to take care of you,” Lindsey baited. Silvie nodded in agreement.“Take care of me?” Carly dropped her gaze to her bloody hands.“Yeah, baby. Who is Rock’s Prez? His brother? Who would Rock trust to take care of you?” Drake said, stepping forward. Carly didn’t hunch back but stared at Drake.“You,” she whispered. Drake nodded and stepped closer, knowing he had her attention now.“Yeah, and if I don’t keep you safe, Carly, what will Rock do?” Drake asked.“Kick your ass,” Carly answered instantly, and her uninjured hand held the bullet wound at her shoulder.“Exactly.” Drake sat near her and waited for her to choose.“Rock would want this,” Carly muttered, and Drake nodded calmly.“Rock would. You being hurt will drive him insane,” Drake confirmed, and before the last word left his mouth, Carly scurried across the floor and launched into his lap. Drake wrapped arms around her and waved one hand at the doctor, who quietly came across and jabbed Carly with a needle. Carly stiffened in Drake’s arms, and her eyes blazed at him.“You betrayed me,” she said with wounded agony in her voice.“No, baby, I did what Rock would want me to do,” Drake muttered and pulled her tightly into his embrace. Carly didn’t have the energy to struggle. Drake realised she’d been running on adrenaline. Slowly, her head dropped, and when Drake was sure she was out, he motioned the doctor forward again. Drake gave the sleeping girl in his arms a kiss on her head.Drake’s heart had turned to stone when Ramirez had called and said Rock and Carly were both on their way to the hospital. Ramirez had said shit looked bad, but Carly was awake, albeit hysterical. Rock had taken two to the chest, and Drake’s gut clenched in pain. First Ace, then Gunner, and now Rock being shot. Rage was clean, and they were still taking bullets! Drake followed the doctors as they took Carly away and was stopped by the nurse as they arrived in the corridor leading to the operating theatre. Drake resolved to stay there until his brother and woman came out. It was going to be a long fuckin’ wait.◆◆◆ “Your girl’s gonna be mad,” Drake said to Rock many hours later. Rock opened his eyes and grunted. “I tricked Carly into getting treatment, and they sedated her,” Drake admitted, relieved to see colour in Rock’s face.“Ain’t gonna be happy,” Rock grunted.“Nah, but Carly was a mess, brother. That girl has ice in her veins until it comes to you. Broke my heart seeing Carly like that, sobbing, hysterical, frightened. Couldn’t let her suffer, and Carly needed help; she was shot too.” Rock’s eyes narrowed on Drake.“Carly’s in a room, and Blaze is with her. Carly took one to the shoulder and a graze in her hairline. I stayed with you, brother,” Drake said, resting his hand on Rock’s arm. Rock’s eyes closed, and Drake watched as his brother drew in even breaths. Relief hit as he realised everything was going to be fine. Rock and Carly were both safe, and both of them would heal.◆◆◆ “I want to sleep with him,” I demanded, as the nurse frowned at me in stern admonishment. Blaze hid a smile behind his hand as he realised I was going to be difficult.“Certainly not. This is a hospital, not a hotel,” the nurse snapped. I folded my arms.“Fine,” I said and glared. Drake had got Rock into the same room as me to recover, and I was itching to check Rock over myself. As soon as the nurse left, I threw the covers back. Blaze was at my side, knowing it was useless to stop me. Blaze helped me out of my bed and into Rocks. Instantly, I burrowed straight into Rock’s big body, patting him and checking he was whole.“Nurse will shit a brick,” Blaze warned me. I cocked open an eye, satisfied that Rock was intact, and shrugged. Ouch, that hurt. My arm was in a sling, and I’d an oversized bandage on my head. With a happy sigh, I closed my eyes and went to sleep with my good arm wrapped around Rock’s stomach.“She can’t sleep there!” an outraged voice hissed.“They’re both sleeping better for the other being there, so why not let them be?” Blaze retorted.“Because this is a hospital!” the angry nurse said indignantly. Ah, the same one as before.“And? They’re not exactly ripping up the sheets, are they? So what’s the big deal? You just said his stats are better, and clearly, Carly is helping him. Christ sake, have compassion, woman,” Blaze said irately.“Excuse me, I have compassion, but I refuse to let them sleep together. It’s enough they’re in the same room,” the nurse said.“Oh, shut up before you wake my woman. We ain’t harming anyone, and if you don’t like it, get lost. I refuse to let you check my woman and me,” Rock piped up angrily.“Now you’ve woken the patient!” the nurse snarled. Jeez, what a petty woman she was.“No, you woke us up with your negative angst. Go away; we refuse to let you touch us,” I said, refusing to open my eyes.“You can’t do that!” the nurse exclaimed.“Sure we can, you’re negative, mean, nasty, and clearly don’t care what’s best for your patient. Carly, being beside me is what’s best for me, so fuck off and take your shitty attitude elsewhere!” Rock said calmly for once.“Agreed,” I said, snuggling into Rock as he shifted in the bed to wrap an arm around me.“Blaze, let Doc Paul know we don’t want her; she’s vile,” I murmured, resting my head on Rock’s shoulder and drifting back off to sleep.I woke up feeling like I was being watched. Tiredly, I peeled open one eyelid and saw Rock’s brown eyes staring at me. His lips quirked in a small smile as he brushed my mane of hair out of my eyes.“Mornin’,” Rock murmured.“Hey,” I replied and worried about morning breath; I must be rank. Rock, however, smelt minty. I spied a pack of mints on the bedside table and snatched one, and shoved it into my mouth. That was better, no blasting Rock with yukky breath.“How you feeling?” Rock asked, his eyes raking me.“Okay, better now I know you’re okay. I’m so sorry,” I whispered. Shame crossed my face. Elrond and Chester had broken into our house and shot us. The insult was worse because it came after a fantastic night out after Bernard’s great food. It was just rude to shoot someone after eating at Bernard’s.“Don’t you ever apologise for those assholes. Fuck baby, you were born into that family; you didn’t ask for it. When I saw that gun aimed at you, my heart stopped. Thought I was going to lose everything,” Rock said, his voice shaky.“Me too. I can’t understand their mentality. Why come after us?” I asked.“Because my guess is they’ve never been told no. Those assholes, baby, they take, asking ain’t something they know how to do. Bettin’ your Dad raised them to be real class A assholes, and they bought into it. There was only one way their tragic nasty lives were going to end, Carly,” Rock said. I sighed because he wasn’t wrong. My father had ruined my brothers, taken anything decent out of them and killed it dead. Rock shifted on the bed and sat up.“Baby, I’m going for a shower and change, ain’t wearing this hospital gown. Blaze brought us loose clothing, so we ain’t gotta wear these,” Rock said, tugging at his gown and glaring. I was smirking when he shuffled out of bed and strode across to the private bathroom. Rock’s muscled ass teased me through the slit in the gown, and I bit back a grin. Yeah, Rock needed to dress. Once those randy nurses caught a load of that, there’d be trouble.◆◆◆ Doc Paul grinned as he read our charts and glanced at us on the bed. The nurse who’d been so mean earlier stood there with an expectant gaze. I held her eyes, wanting her to know there was no way I was leaving this bed. Doc Paul put the chart down, and his stance turned relaxed.“You’re both healing well, and there’re no complications. Carly, you can be discharged tomorrow and Rock in two days. But,” Doc Paul said, holding up his hand, “I imagine Carly won’t leave you. I’ll discharge you together in two days. You can tell Penny you can eat anything now. Neither of you is on a liquid diet,” Doc Paul said as the nurse’s face fell.“Penny been bugging you, Doc?” Rock asked.“Woman’s texted me ten times when she can bring proper food and not the slop we dish up,” Doc Paul grinned. The nurse made an outraged noise.“Penny’s stubborn,” Rock said.“And the food is awful here,” I agreed.“Well, I’m happy for now. Do not do anything to tear those stitches,” Doc Paul warned with a wicked glint in his eye.“Doctor, you seriously can’t mean for them to stay in the same bed?” the nurse said belligerently.“Nurse, who are they harming? They are in a private room, and if we try to dislodge one, they will both leave, which will be detrimental to their health. Plus, Phoenix made a rather large donation which I believe will be withdrawn should they be separated. For the sake of two days, suck it up and appreciate the fact they’re in love!” Doc Paul scolded, and a smug look crossed my face.◆◆◆ Several hours later, I was curled up dozing when there was a knock at the door. Rock twisted his head as the door opened, and his entire body tensed. I stared curiously at the man and woman who entered and hissed in a breath. The man was a pale version of Rock, at least thirty years older, but he’d definitely gone to seed. A jowly face and overhanging belly nearly hidden by the cut of his suit. This was Rock’s parents. Mitchell and Diana Johnson.“What do you want?” Rock growled, and I placed a hand on his arm. His entire body was strung like a wire.“Hello, son, we heard you had been shot,” the man said, his gaze sliding over me and a look of complete distaste crossing his face. If anything, Rock got even tenser.“What’s that to do with you?” Rock growled.“You’re our son,” Diana said.“Since when?” Rock shot back. He folded his arms across his chest and then thought better of it and dragged me under one holding me tightly against his side.“Heath!” Diana exclaimed, a pained expression crossing her face.“Name’s Rock,” he said with a dark look.“What stupid name is that?” Mitchell sneered, and I bristled. Mitchell’s gaze glanced at me again and dismissed me as unimportant.“The name my family gave me,” Rock replied and stared at them.“Those bikers you run around with? Honestly, Heath, you were raised better than that,” Mitchell said. Rock chuckled darkly.“You raised me to be an ass licking, yes, man. Didn’t sit well with me, so chose my own family,” Rock retorted.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell shot back, his shoulders squaring up and failing to look impressive.“Why don’t you tell me what you want and then get the hell back to ignoring my existence?” Rock drawled his eyes wary. I felt pain that they were treating Rock like this. Who did they think they were?“Son, we’ve kept tabs on you for a while,” Diana said gently but making it seem like she was offering Rock a gift.“And?” Rock grunted, not showing an ounce of leeway.“We’ve been impressed with your actions recently,” Mitchell said, and I bristled again.“Just recently?” I spat, unable to hold my tongue anymore.“And just who are you?” Diana asked icily.“Rock’s old lady,” I said, jerking my head at Rock. Diana’s lip curled in dislike, and she turned her gaze away from me. Dismissing me as beneath her worthiness. Rock tensed again under my hand. That was a mistake.“Well, your actions have proved you worthy. We want you to re-join the family,” Mitchell said. I hissed in a sharp breath. How dare they? Anger rose, but Rock’s arm squeezed me tightly.“Nah, I’m good, thanks, don’t need your poor excuse of a family,” Rock demurred.“You deny us?” Mitchell said in disbelief.“Why the fuck would you think I’d re-join your fucking family?” Rock thundered, and I jumped.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell thundered and took a visible intake of air. “You’ve proved yourself worthy, Heath. Your actions during the flood and now saving this… girl’s life were heroic. They would look great on my campaign.” My eyes nearly bugged from my head. Surely Mitchell couldn’t be serious?“Fuck you and fuck that bitch. Fuck your campaign too,” Rock said, pointing at his father and mother. “Over a decade ago, you threw me away because I wouldn’t fall into the life that you planned for me. Refused to accept I’d my own personality and desires for life. Denied me family because I wouldn’t sell my soul and kneel and obey at the feet of the great Mitchell Johnson.I was left out in the cold, and without my grandparents, I’d have had no family. Fuck you, Diana, you even cut them off because they didn’t fit in with your diamonds and Chanel. Seriously, how the fuck do you have the balls to walk into my life and tell me I’m good enough for you? You ain’t fuckin’ good enough for me!” Rock roared.“Heath…” Mitchell said, his face stern and angry.“Fuck Heath. Heath’s dead to you and has been since you kicked him out. Heath discovered a new family who accepted him and what he was. Why the hell do you think I need you in my life? I got along just fine without you, and I don’t fuckin’ need you now. And I tell ya now, any reporter seeks me out, I’ll let the damn world know how the great Mitchell Johnson treats family. Oh yeah, what a story that will make,” Rock snarled.“We’re leaving,” Mitchell growled.“Don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya,” Rock said and rolled on his side away from them. I tucked into his shoulder and heard the door slam. I was furious at how Rock’s parents had ambushed him.“You okay?” I asked.“Yeah, they don’t mean shit to me,” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my head.“That was upsetting,” I urged, hoping he’d open up and talk to me.“Nah, all Mitchell wanted to do was parade me around, bragging about his hero son. Mitchell’s right; it would have looked great on his campaign trail but fuck him. I’m not Mitchell’s puppet and haven’t been for years. I have far better things to do with my life, and dancing to his tune isn’t one of them. They threw me out and kicked me to the curb; they have no right to intrude on my life now,” Rock said firmly.I agreed wholeheartedly with him. My family was shit, total shit, and we were trailer trash rednecks. But Rock’s family hadn’t been poor like mine; they’d been well off and highly educated and not appreciated what a diamond they had. Instead, they abused and wholly misunderstood the wonderful son they had. Of course, that became a huge benefit to me. Rock and I would never have met if he’d stayed Heath Johnson.I rubbed my cheek on Rock’s chest and snuggled up. Rock lay there calmly as he assimilated what had just happened. I offered silent support as Rock chewed over the audacity of his parents, and then Rock snorted.“Fuck them, ain’t thinking about them no more. What we doing when we escape this joint?” Rock asked.“Whatever you want?” I said drowsily.“Oh yeah?” Rock teased. I slapped his firm stomach, and Rock chuckled.“Yeah.”“Want to plan a wedding?” Rock asked, and my drowsiness disappeared in the blink of an eye.“What?” I exclaimed, sitting up.“Marry me, I’ll give you a month to plan the wedding, but it has to be on Rage. Axel is conducting it, and don’t expect monkey suits or bullshit like that. But plan the wedding you want within reason,” Rock warned and mock scowled.“Wow, I’m overwhelmed by your proposal,” I said, my hand going to my heart. Rock scowled for real this time.“Ain’t a hearts and flowers guy Carly,” he warned. I sniggered; no, Rock most certainly wasn’t. But Rock was my guy, and I loved him.“So no getting on one knee?” I said, pretending to be serious.“What the fuck, Carly?” Rock growled, and I began giggling.“The look on your face!”“Woman, I’ll put you over my knee if you continue,” Rock threatened, and I broke into peals of laughter.“Is that meant to be a deterrent?” I gasped between chuckles.“Nope, a promise,” Rock said and tackled me to the bed. “Marry me.”“Yes,” I said and reached up to wrap my arms around his neck. Rock’s lips twitched into a smile of approval before he gave me his first kiss as his fiancée.◆◆◆ “Dum, dum dum, another one bites the dust,” Blaze sang, pointing at Rock. Rock launched a beer bottle at Blaze’s head, followed by an ashtray. I twisted my head, checked Rock was okay and sank back into a couch. I was listening to the old ladies plan the wedding and was heartily bored with the entire subject. Phoe was rambling about flowers, for which I arched an eyebrow at her.I’d already shot down a big white gown, limo, massive cake, and lord knows what else. All I wanted was a simple white dress, a small posy of flowers, cake, grill and Rock under an arch at the back of Rage. But making the old ladies understand that was freaking hard. I should have known better than to mention Rock had asked me to marry him.A shout made me jump, and I laughed as Rock took Blaze to the floor, wrestling. Drake snorted in amusement as Rock bounced Blaze’s head off the floor. Blaze heaved upwards, and Rock elbowed him in the belly. I rolled my eyes at Phoe, and we smiled. Blaze had been needling Rock ever since he’d found out Rock had asked me to marry him. I wasn’t sure if Blaze was acting as an irritating older brother (mine) or had finally just found a way to needle Rock. But Blaze had been a pain in Rock’s ass ever since we left the hospital. Blaze jammed an elbow into Rock’s thigh and punched him in the ribs, deliberately missing Rock’s wounds. Ace strode over and separated the wrestling men and promptly took a fist to the gut. He lifted an eye as Rock stared unabashedly back and hauled Blaze to his feet, shaking his head.“Fuckin’ children,” Ace muttered, and Axel howled with laughter. Rock smirked and strutted over to me; I imagined he thought he’d won that one.“How’s it going, baby?” Rock asked, dropping a light kiss on my lips. The old ladies stopped chatting and stared in rapt attention.“No one’s listening to me, so I give up. Can we run off to Vegas?” I bitched, and Rock’s eyes rolled.“Yeah, we can do,” Rock said, dropping another kiss on my lips. An outraged gasp sounded, and I knew Lindsey was glaring daggers at us.“Well, if they don’t listen, we can fly out this weekend,” Rock threatened, and further outraged gasps echoed. Rock winked, and I smiled against his mouth. He ran a finger down my face and knew his job was done. The old ladies would listen to me or miss out on our wedding.“Okay, what do you want?” Marsha sighed, and with a smile, I turned to face the thwarted women who were quietly fuming. Happily assured I’d be getting the wedding I wanted, I turned to Phoe and began speaking.◆◆◆ A knock surprised me as I wasn’t expecting anyone; I took the pots off the stove and turned off the gas. Strolling into the hallway, I opened the door and looked up and then again. A huge man stood in the doorway with white-blond hair and a scar running down his right cheek. A tattoo of black and red flames curled up his neck surrounding a dragon’s tail tattooed on his throat. Dark brown eyes stared at me coldly.“Carly?” his voice rumbled, and I stepped back, unsure.“Yes?” I spoke.“Don’t be afraid; I’m a friend. Need you to get a message to Drake, and I can’t go to the clubhouse because it’s being watched,” he said.“What? Who?” I stammered.“A friend Carly,” he insisted. I cocked my head and stared. A vague memory came to mind, Silvie describing someone.“You’re Ghost,” I said and stepped back, my hand searching for a weapon to defend myself.“No, I’m not a threat Carly. Rock isn’t being watched. I need Drake to receive a message. Warn him Taxman has taken over the Dark Souls of Lucifer. They have found somewhere to lie low, but I’m not aware where yet. Tell Drake I’m tracking them, and Blaze is a target. Carly, listen to me; Blaze must be protected, he’s on a hit list they have, and he’s right at the top,” Ghost said, and I stared. Ice flooded through my veins at the thought of Blaze in danger.“Why are you warning us? Because you hurt Silvie and betrayed Rage,” I hissed, my spine tingling in defence of Blaze.“No! I never ever hurt Silvie; I’d have given my life to prevent that. And I never betrayed Rage, Carly; I don’t fuckin’ care if you believe me or not. Just give Drake my warning,” Ghost insisted, his hands peacefully held by his side.“Oh, I’ll tell Drake alright, and Blaze, that you’ve put a target on his back,” I snapped.“For fuck’s sake, woman, I’m bringing a warning, don’t wanna see Rage get hurt. Blaze has a bigger target on his back than Drake does, which makes me think shit’s personal. Get Blaze to list his enemies and track them. Rage has excellent support, not that they need it, but Hawthorne will help. He’s tied to Rage tight now,” Ghost said patiently.“How does Drake contact you?” I asked.“He doesn’t. Drake can’t know shit about me other than this warning. Tell Drake to stop hunting me before he draws even more eyes,” Ghost warned, and a shiver ran down my spine again.“Bullshit,” I said. I was trying to keep Ghost talking. Rock should be home soon, and if I kept him here, Rock could handle him.“Know what you’re doing, Carly. Give Rock my warning to give to Drake,” Ghost said with a wry smile and strolled over to a bike and throttled it. He disappeared, and I cursed. Desperately, trying to keep everything Ghost said straight in my mind, I dashed back into the house and found a notepad and wrote down every word that Ghost had said. I was just finishing when pipes roared, and Rock pulled up outside our home.“Carly!” Rock called as he stomped towards me.“In here,” I called back, scribbling the last few words. Rock strolled in, and that flicker of desire flared between us. Idly I wondered if it would always be like that, a flame waiting to be stoked into a blaze.“How you doing, baby?” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my upturned face.“We had a visitor, Ghost. He came to give Drake a warning,” I said, and Rock’s face turned angry.“Say that again,” he demanded.“Ghost came here; he said he had a warning for Drake, Blaze and Rage. I’ve written it down word for word as best I could,” I said, motioning to the notepad. Rock’s face might as well have been carved from stone for all the emotion he showed. He picked up the pad and read it.“Good girl,” Rock said finally after reading it twice and dropped another kiss on my mouth before strolling away. I heard him on the phone, and then Rock returned.“Honey, Drake’s calling in the inner sanctum now. Can you turn off whatever you’re cooking and come and speak to Drake? This is too important to leave until the morning,” Rock asked gently. We spent around four nights a week at home, the other three at the clubhouse, and I cherished those nights at home. Rock was asking a lot for me to give up one of those precious nights.“Of course,” I said. There was no hesitation. This message was too important, and Drake clearly agreed.“Thank you, baby, I’ll order Bernard’s for you, get you ribs and fries delivered,” Rock bribed, and I laughed. He didn’t need to bribe me, but it was nice Rock thought about it.“With slaw and corn,” I grinned, and Rock slung an arm around my waist as he steered me outside to his bike.“And a huge double helping of Bernard’s chocolate orange sponge cake and custard.” Rock smiled. He mounted his bike, and I swung up behind him. Despite Rock smiling, he was as tense as fuck. Ghost had unsettled the status quo by coming to our home. Rock was unamused that I might have been in danger, and I could sense his brain turning matters over on how to ensure our safety here. The bike roared, and dust kicked up, and we sped off.◆◆◆ Two weeks later, we heard from child services. Luckily for us, we’d got a great social worker, and she’d been diligent at bringing Blake, Harrison, and Bonnie to us daily. Miss Winch’s investigations into Rock and I had finished, and we’d been waiting for her report. Rock and I had signed the paperwork to adopt them and were waiting to hear if child services and the court approved of us. Rock and I had attended court a week ago. Instead of giving an immediate decision, the judge had taken time to consider us as parents.I glanced at the window as a car pulled up and walked to the front door to see who’d arrived. My heart leapt into my mouth as Miss Winch got out, wearing a stern expression. Rock appeared behind me and placed his hands on my shoulders. Miss Winch opened the back door and leaned inside. When she stepped back, Bonnie tore towards us, yelling at the top of her lungs.A scream of joy left my lips as I dashed towards Bonnie and scooped her up. Bonnie babbled happily in her baby talk as Harrison followed behind and ran for Rock. Blake got out more cautiously and hesitated by Miss Winch.“The judge approved the adoption,” she said and broke into a smile.“Wonderful!” I exclaimed, hugging Bonnie tightly. Rock knelt down to Blake’s level.“Hey buddy, want to see your room?” Rock asked Blake.“Yeah,” Blake said a little sullenly.“Blake will adjust, give him time,” Miss Winch said, and I nodded.“Yeah, did you fulfil our other request?” I asked. When we’d gone to court, Rock and I had requested photos of the children and their parents. We intended to keep their parents alive for them. Miss Winch let out a beaming smile and then opened the trunk of her car. Inside were four boxes full of the children’s and their parents’ belongings. She lifted them out and put them on the ground.“This is what could be salvaged. It’s kind of you to honour their parents. Most would let their memories drop,” Miss Winch said.“We’re not most people, and their parents deserve to be remembered for their sacrifice. They should be remembered and honoured,” I replied, kissing Bonnie as she placed a smacker on my cheek.“Blake, Harrison and Bonnie are fortunate,” Miss Winch said and got back in her car.“Thank you,” I said, allowing emotion to leak into my voice.“No, thank you. Blake, Harrison and Bonnie will be thrilled. Their completed paperwork is in one of those boxes. Be lucky Carly,” Miss Winch said and pulled away.“Welcome home, honey,” I said, smiling at Bonnie, who grinned.“Carly!” Rock yelled as a boy’s laughter came from the house.“Oh dear, shall we go see what the menfolk are up to?” I asked Bonnie, who clapped her hands.",

      "content": "Epilogue.The night of Ghost’s visit.Drake sat back with his arms folded at the back of his head. He was as disturbed as anyone in the sanctum. Carly had told her story twice and answered questions, and then gone to eat the feast Rock had ordered for her. Rage was still no closer to discovering what game Ghost was playing. Nor were they close to finding where he was bunking down.“I want a list of everyone you have crossed, small or big, imagined or real,” Drake said, pointing at Blaze, who had been asked to attend the meeting. Gunner sat tense with Apache next to him. Drake’s eyes studied Apache, wondering how the man was doing. Ghost and Apache had been closer than blood at one point. Blaze nodded.“Whoever is watching you is the one with the grudge,” Ace said, and Blaze gave a chin lift. No denying that.“Gunner, up security, aim cameras at the street. Ain’t gonna mess with this warning. Whatever fuckin’ game Ghost is playing, we’ll be on guard,” Drake said.“He came to my home, Drake,” Rock snarled. He glanced around at the inner circle and Blaze. Axel met his eyes head-on. Texas was contemplating something which had the big man frowning. Fish followed Rock’s gaze.“What, Texas?” Fish asked.“Ghost was never one to play games. Was always a straight shooter, so why the cloak and daggers?” Texas mused.“You thinkin’ he’s into something, and he’s so deep in shit he can’t get out?” Apache asked, leaning forward.“Dunno, just saying, it ain’t like Ghost to play stupid games. We ain’t got enough to say what the bastard’s up to,” Texas replied.“Ghost often hid in the background, taking shit in and assimilating it before acting. The man was a planner and insightful. You thinkin’ he ain’t betrayed Rage?” Apache pushed.“Brother, I can’t say. His going to Rock’s home means he didn’t want to be seen or caught. So he’s either covering or hiding from someone. If Silvie hadn’t had seen him, I don’t think the man would have broken whatever cover he’s hiding behind,” Texas replied.“Ghost took Drake’s side. Man was firmly entrenched in getting Rage clean, so none of this bullshit makes sense,” Axel boomed, and Gunner looked up.“Was he though, or was he playin’ us all?”“Dunno. But we got his warning. Blaze, this gonna suck for you, but I don’t want you alone. Want you on Rage whenever possible and no riding alone. You’re not to be at the gym alone, get Hunter to open, and we can have a candidate close it. But no going there without backup,” Ace warned Blaze.“We can’t keep that up long term,” Blaze said.“No, we can’t, so we gotta track down what Ghost is doing with Dark Souls of Lucifer. Those assholes are the common link. Track them, and we may crack open more leads,” Gunner said.“We got a plan, so let’s move it,” Drake said and slammed the table with his gravel.◆◆◆ “You think Rage will listen?” a voice asked Ghost as he stood staring at the Black Hills. Ghost turned to the man. Their meeting had been concluded, but the other guy was still here.“I sent a warning, can’t do shit else,” Ghost said.“Rage are stubborn assholes, if we brought them into this….”“I said no!” Ghost thundered, his temper lighting. “Rage are off-limits. You got me, that’s enough. Touch Rage, and I’ll burn the city down, you hear me? The brothers, candidates, prospects, old ladies and kids, all protected by our agreement. Break that dude, and you’ll never stop looking over your shoulder. I was Rage’s soldier. Never forget that,” Ghost warned.“Just saying…”“Don’t fuckin’ just say. Do your job, and I’ll do mine,” Ghost warned and turned his back. His eyes swept the landscape, looking for danger, any trace he’d been followed. There was none. He wasn’t called Ghost for no reason. One day, Ghost promised, one day soon, this would end.",

      "content": "Prologue.April 2016Rock lifted his head from where he was working on a car as a car door slammed shut in temper, and then a second slam echoed. Curiously, Rock gazed at the scene unfolding on the forecourt.“God damn fucking frigid bitch,” a voice hollered, not caring who was present. Unamused, Rock grabbed a rag and wiped his hands and walked out of the bay. His eyes widened as Carly stormed towards the bays. The dickhead she’d been seeing was storming after her, and Carly stopped dead and turned on her heels to confront him. Rock shook his head; he’d no idea why Carly insisted on dating these preppy jerks.“You piece of trash,” Carly hissed, her hands going to her hips, and she leaned forward, facing the dickhead.“Yeah, Carly, you’re a fucking tease. Showing legs, tits and ass and not fucking putting out.” “Why the fuck would I put out?” Carly snarled back. Rock took the wall and leaned against it, and watched carefully.“Taken you out for three weeks, and you don’t even let me get my hand in your pants,” dickhead snarled back.“Oh, so a few meals and a cinema date means I spread my legs? Well, fuck, I need a bunch of flowers before I do that,” Carly snapped, and Rock felt amusement.“Well, we know where you come from.”“Oh, because I work at Made by Rage, it makes me a whore?” Carly snarled, her temper igniting. Then, outraged, she flipped her hair back and pointed a finger.“Put out for a biker and not a decent guy.” Woah, Rock straightened. That was a direct attack against Rage and Carly.“Decent guy? Decent guy?” Carly shrieked. “A decent guy doesn’t think that taking a girl for a meal entitles him to get in her pants!” Rock’s mouth twitched.“Well, everyone knows easy pussy hangs around Rage.” Carly received as an answer.“Well, you can go back and tell your little pals that you ain’t got a hook in Rage like you were bragging. Oh yeah,” Carly sneered as his body rolled back, “I heard you last night, telling your buds that you had an in to the MC. Fucking prick. Rage takes real men, not little boys.” Rock snorted, and their heads turned towards him. He looked down at himself, motorcycle boots, faded jeans, white wife-beater, and bearded. Rock then looked at dickhead, pressed jeans, cowboy boots, the fancy kind, pressed white shirt and a v-necked jumper over the top, pink at that.Carly didn’t hesitate; she turned to dickhead and looked him up and down, and smirked. Then, deliberately, Carly turned to Rock and checked him over and shot him a look of pure, unadulterated lust that rocked him back on his heels.“Oh yeah,” Carly breathed, “Real men, not little boys.” Rock eyed her warily. Carly was up to something, and he wondered what she planned.“Dirty bitch,” dickhead sneered. Carly shot him a glance, and her mouth engaged.“Wanna see what you’re missing out on, little boy.” Carly waggled her little finger at him, and the meaning was not lost on those watching. Dickhead went puce in fury. Carly strutted her shit across to Rock and slid her hands into his hair. Without a word she yanked his head down, and her mouth slammed into his.The second his mouth touched hers, Rock didn’t hesitate. For two years, he’d watched Carly, and this was it. He was having her. His mouth took over, and the kiss heated. Hands slid to her ass and cupped it, pulling her against him. Carly’s mouth opened, and Rock slid his tongue in, duelling with hers. Carly leaned into Rock, pressing her tits against him, and she went fucking wild.Rock hooked a hand under Carly’s leg and drew it up, pressing his cock into her. Carly, in return, wrapped her leg around his and hauled herself up Rock’s body like she was Artemis climbing Ace. Carly’s hands gripped his hair harder. Rock broke the kiss off and gazed into enormous brown eyes. They were dazed and full of lust. Carly’s mouth was swollen and soft, and he found he really fucking liked that expression on her. Her legs were wrapped around his waist, with one hand on her ass, the other in her hair.“Shit, you fucking whore,” dickhead hissed furiously. Rock lifted his head and stared straight at him. He saw Lowrider standing near, looking amused, and gently passed Carly off to him and then began striding towards dickhead, who started moving backwards fast. His ass hit his car, and he began sliding around it just as Rock reached him.“No man calls a Rage woman whore. No man remains standin’ after he calls a Rage woman whore. Any man who is a man makes sure that when a Rage woman is called a whore, he puts that trash out and makes sure it stays out,” Rock gritted. Dickhead turned from bright red to pure white in seconds. Rock put one hand on the dickhead and pushed hard, and dickhead stumbled backwards. Rock smirked as the kid nearly pissed himself. He watched through narrow eyes as dickhead scrambled for his footing.Rock opened the car door and shoved dickhead into it, and began counting. Dickhead didn’t hesitate, pushed the car into reverse and sped away. Rock turned around and saw Carly’s pert ass hurrying across the forecourt towards Made by Rage. Oh yeah, baby, you can run, but you can’t fuckin’ hide, he thought to himself and gave an amused Lowrider a chin lift.“Wow, our kitten has claws,” Lowrider said, laughing.“Carly’s got a fuckin’ mouth,” Rock grunted, his own amusement showing.“In more ways than one brother,” Lowrider snorted and then threw his head back and roared with laughter.“Tellin’ me.” An expression of surprise crossed Lowrider’s face when Rock let out a chuckle.“Yeah,” Lowrider said, looking at him.“That bitch is mine,” Rock grunted again and, laughing to himself, returned to work. Run, baby, run. You can’t run fast enough, he thought.◆◆◆ “Oh my God, I kissed Rock! And Rock kissed me back, with tongue!” I exclaimed, running into Made by Rage, Designs by Lindsey. Embarrassed, I skidded to a halt and groaned as Drake’s eyebrows shot up. Apache sent me a surprised but definitely shit-eating grin. Both men had arms around their women, Drake around Phoe, and Apache around Silvie. Phoe had her hands full of Lindsey’s jewellery, and I guessed Phoe was in a buying mood, and Drake was not denying her that. Standing around was every single old lady Rage had.“Oh my God, was Rock good?” Silvie cried out and wheezed as Apache squeezed her.“Not sure what you want me to reply to that, kitten,” Apache drawled, replying to my first statement, and I turned red.“That wasn’t for you,” I replied, embarrassed.“Nope, I’m guessin’ not. Don’t wanna hear you share,” Drake said with more than a hint of humour in his voice.“Oh wow, can Rock kiss?” I felt myself go even redder as Lindsey vaulted the barrier in pure excitement. Apache quickly let go of Silvie to stop Lindsey from falling.“Oh, Rock can so kiss. And I bet with that beard it was hot!” Silvie yelped gleefully as Apache ducked his head.“And I’m outta here,” Drake said, giving Phoe a distracted kiss, distracted on her side as she clearly wished to get the gossip. Drake sighed, tilted Phoe’s head and looked into her eyes. Phoe’s eyes flared, and they kissed again. Far better, Drake’s expression said.“Comin’ with,” Apache said, hurrying out.“Carly kissed Rock? With tongue?” Sin breathed.“How, what happened? Tell us everything!” Penny gasped and dragged me through the barrier towards the staff seating area.“Well, I kissed Rock!” I squealed.“Got that,” said an amused voice, and Marsha and Artemis barrelled through the co-joined Rage Shop and Made by Rage wooden barrier. I spun on Artemis and hopped up and down.“Shit, I kissed Rock. I mean, I walked up to him, and I dragged his head down, and I kissed him!” I said in a high-pitched voice.“Oh my god, Carly, you started the kiss,” Phoe exclaimed.“I’m so proud of you!” Lindsey began jumping up and down as well. “My baby has grown up.”“Rock kiss you back? Hand action?” Ellen asked. Wow, Axel’s old lady was asking me about hand action.“Oh yeah, Rock kissed me back. So hot! I had my hands in his hair; it’s like silk,” I whispered.“Wow, you know, I always thought there was something between you,” Lindsey said. Silvie squealed and bounced on the spot.“I knew it; you’ve had the hots for Rock for years,” Sin squealed, and I glared. “It was magic!” I whispered, thinking of Rock’s mouth on mine.“Was there fireworks?” Autumn asked, settling on the arm of one chair. I blushed again.“There were fireworks,” Artemis nodded. “Ace is like that; intense sexiness and drool-worthy, and I just have to jump him and have hot monkey sex.”“No, I didn’t have hot monkey sex with Rock!” I shouted. “I kissed his ass off, though.”“Woah, wait, you were naked?” Marsha cried excitedly. No, no, they weren’t listening!“No, no nakedness. I wouldn’t mind seeing Rock naked, though. Damn, I bet he’s something naked.” I clapped a hand over my mouth. “What’s wrong with me!”“Um, Rock naked, yeah, I can imagine that. That tight ass, long legs, oh yeah Carly, I bet Rock’s something,” Artemis drawled.“I wanna see Rock naked now,” Phoe said, her eyes drifting off. Damn, did Phoe just say that?“Oh, me too. Rock has always been a yummy brother,” Marsha agreed.“All that smouldering intensity,” Ellen drooled.“I kissed that intensity; it was intense!” I yelped.“Rock kissed you back,” Artemis reminded me.“I climbed him like a tree,” I yelped again.“Oh my God, you climbed him? Hot monkey sex,” Artemis nodded sagely.“You’re not helping!” I cried as Artemis grinned wickedly. “Rock’s going to think I’m a harlot!”“Honey, the guys know you’re not a harlot,” Penny said, laughing. They did? I wasn’t sure about that; I’d been dating a few preppy boys lately, anything to get my mind off Rock.“Rock grabbed my ass and then pulled my leg up to hook around his thigh. I climbed him like a monkey. He’s so hard.” I sighed internally, my mouth just kept engaging.“Rock was hard?” Marsha giggled.“Oh my.” I blushed even more profoundly.“Holy shit. How big is he?” Autumn asked, and I swear she drooled.“Rock’s gonna think I’m a harlot!” I whispered. “I made him kiss me, and I climbed him like a monkey; I put my ass in his hands!”“How did you put your ass in his hands? It’s such a nice ass Carly,” Silvie asked curiously. She craned her head around me to look at my ass. This was getting worse; I couldn’t get my words out and wasn’t making sense.“Rock put his hands on me, and I wriggled my ass into them more!” I said softly.“Bettin’ Rock liked that,” Marsha said, nodding.“Honey, Rock likes you,” Ellen said. My head snapped up. Rock did? The man was one of the most remote brothers, so I knew little about him, except that I gravitated to him like a moth to a flame. Hold on, though…“Yes, but Rock didn’t ask me to force kiss him on the forecourt in front of Lowrider! I forced Rock to kiss me!” I said, panicking. “Oh my God, I attacked Rock and forced him to kiss me. I forced my ass into his hands and climbed him like a monkey. It was fuckin’ great.” I clapped my hands over my mouth again, “I didn’t say that, I didn’t say that!”“Yes, you did!” Lindsey cried gleefully. I was beginning to hate my boss.“In front of Lowrider?” Sin asked, and I nodded.“What did he do?” Lindsey asked.“Which one?” Autumn smirked. Okay, I was beginning to hate Autumn too.“No idea because I ran away when Rock pushed Richard into his car for calling me a whore.”“Rock pushed that dick headed twat?” Penny asked.“Richard called me a whore after I kissed Rock, and Rock then got manly and hard and pushed him into the car, yelling at Richard about Rage women. Again, it was freaking hot!”“Rock definitely likes you.” Silvie nodded her head.“Yeah, but that was before I forced Rock to kiss me.” I dropped my head in despair.“Honey, he wants you. Rock’s eyes get this sexy look when he stares at you,” Ellen stressed.“Rock wouldn’t have let you mount him if he didn’t,” Phoe said.“Oh shit, I did, I mounted him like riding a horse!”“Horse sex doesn’t have the same feel as monkey sex does,” Sin mused. I choked.“Bet Rock’s hung like a horse,” Phoe grinned.“Oh, he’s big.” I nodded.“Hung like a horse big?” Artemis asked slyly.“How the hell do I know? I don’t go around measuring horse dicks!” I shouted, embarrassed. Penny fell in the armchair, laughing her ass off.“I got to leave because I can’t face him,” I said and got instant no’s from the girls.“Rock will hunt you down if you do,” Silvie said, giggling.“If Rock’s hung like a horse, why on earth do you want to leave? You need to naked mount him! You need to ride his ass!” Artemis exclaimed. In horror, I stared at Artemis. Out of all the old ladies, we knew she was the kinkiest and most open about sex. We’d heard countless stories about hers and Ace’s sex life, and yeah, I’d been jealous.“I’m not riding Rock’s ass!” I squealed.“Sheesh, I don’t mean ride his ass, ride his ass, I mean give Rock reverse cowgirl or something,” Artemis grinned. “Ace loves reverse cowgirl; he does this thing with his finger….” Artemis broke off, and her eyes glazed over.“Lowrider does this thing with his finger and cock at the same time; it makes me melt. He’s so freaking hot,” Lindsey shared.“I’m not doing anything to Rock’s ass with my finger,” I said.Howls of male laughter erupted behind us. We gazed across the room to the glass doors that led into the Rage shop, and to my horror, I saw Gunner, Manny, Lowrider and Mac standing there. Mac was bent over laughing so hard, he was shaking, and he’d a phone in his hand.Gunner was holding on to the door laughing; I was struck by that; I’d never seen Gunner laugh. Lowrider was grinning like a monkey, and Manny was bent over like Mac laughing his ass off. They looked at our shocked expressions and carried on laughing. Finally, Mac straightened up and began tapping buttons on his phone.“Gotta send that shit to the guys,” Mac snorted, and before anyone could stop him, he hit send. Mac jumped the barrier, walked over, kissed me on my head and sauntered out.“Where did you record that from?” Phoe asked, her eyes narrowed.“Lindsey vaulting the barrier. Got that shit on tape,” Manny grunted, and the guys left them alone, still chuckling.“Ace will kick your ass,” Artemis shouted after them.“Ace will kick yours for tellin’ about his finger,” Lowrider shot back, and we heard his chuckle.“Your finger is banned from me,” Lindsey called.“Tell me tonight after I’ve done my finger thing,” Lowrider called back, and Lindsey huffed, but we saw the smile on her face. Yeah, Lowrider was still going to do his thing.",

      "content": "Prologue.April 2016Rock lifted his head from where he was working on a car as a car door slammed shut in temper, and then a second slam echoed. Curiously, Rock gazed at the scene unfolding on the forecourt.“God damn fucking frigid bitch,” a voice hollered, not caring who was present. Unamused, Rock grabbed a rag and wiped his hands and walked out of the bay. His eyes widened as Carly stormed towards the bays. The dickhead she’d been seeing was storming after her, and Carly stopped dead and turned on her heels to confront him. Rock shook his head; he’d no idea why Carly insisted on dating these preppy jerks.“You piece of trash,” Carly hissed, her hands going to her hips, and she leaned forward, facing the dickhead.“Yeah, Carly, you’re a fucking tease. Showing legs, tits and ass and not fucking putting out.” “Why the fuck would I put out?” Carly snarled back. Rock took the wall and leaned against it, and watched carefully.“Taken you out for three weeks, and you don’t even let me get my hand in your pants,” dickhead snarled back.“Oh, so a few meals and a cinema date means I spread my legs? Well, fuck, I need a bunch of flowers before I do that,” Carly snapped, and Rock felt amusement.“Well, we know where you come from.”“Oh, because I work at Made by Rage, it makes me a whore?” Carly snarled, her temper igniting. Then, outraged, she flipped her hair back and pointed a finger.“Put out for a biker and not a decent guy.” Woah, Rock straightened. That was a direct attack against Rage and Carly.“Decent guy? Decent guy?” Carly shrieked. “A decent guy doesn’t think that taking a girl for a meal entitles him to get in her pants!” Rock’s mouth twitched.“Well, everyone knows easy pussy hangs around Rage.” Carly received as an answer.“Well, you can go back and tell your little pals that you ain’t got a hook in Rage like you were bragging. Oh yeah,” Carly sneered as his body rolled back, “I heard you last night, telling your buds that you had an in to the MC. Fucking prick. Rage takes real men, not little boys.” Rock snorted, and their heads turned towards him. He looked down at himself, motorcycle boots, faded jeans, white wife-beater, and bearded. Rock then looked at dickhead, pressed jeans, cowboy boots, the fancy kind, pressed white shirt and a v-necked jumper over the top, pink at that.Carly didn’t hesitate; she turned to dickhead and looked him up and down, and smirked. Then, deliberately, Carly turned to Rock and checked him over and shot him a look of pure, unadulterated lust that rocked him back on his heels.“Oh yeah,” Carly breathed, “Real men, not little boys.” Rock eyed her warily. Carly was up to something, and he wondered what she planned.“Dirty bitch,” dickhead sneered. Carly shot him a glance, and her mouth engaged.“Wanna see what you’re missing out on, little boy.” Carly waggled her little finger at him, and the meaning was not lost on those watching. Dickhead went puce in fury. Carly strutted her shit across to Rock and slid her hands into his hair. Without a word she yanked his head down, and her mouth slammed into his.The second his mouth touched hers, Rock didn’t hesitate. For two years, he’d watched Carly, and this was it. He was having her. His mouth took over, and the kiss heated. Hands slid to her ass and cupped it, pulling her against him. Carly’s mouth opened, and Rock slid his tongue in, duelling with hers. Carly leaned into Rock, pressing her tits against him, and she went fucking wild.Rock hooked a hand under Carly’s leg and drew it up, pressing his cock into her. Carly, in return, wrapped her leg around his and hauled herself up Rock’s body like she was Artemis climbing Ace. Carly’s hands gripped his hair harder. Rock broke the kiss off and gazed into enormous brown eyes. They were dazed and full of lust. Carly’s mouth was swollen and soft, and he found he really fucking liked that expression on her. Her legs were wrapped around his waist, with one hand on her ass, the other in her hair.“Shit, you fucking whore,” dickhead hissed furiously. Rock lifted his head and stared straight at him. He saw Lowrider standing near, looking amused, and gently passed Carly off to him and then began striding towards dickhead, who started moving backwards fast. His ass hit his car, and he began sliding around it just as Rock reached him.“No man calls a Rage woman whore. No man remains standin’ after he calls a Rage woman whore. Any man who is a man makes sure that when a Rage woman is called a whore, he puts that trash out and makes sure it stays out,” Rock gritted. Dickhead turned from bright red to pure white in seconds. Rock put one hand on the dickhead and pushed hard, and dickhead stumbled backwards. Rock smirked as the kid nearly pissed himself. He watched through narrow eyes as dickhead scrambled for his footing.Rock opened the car door and shoved dickhead into it, and began counting. Dickhead didn’t hesitate, pushed the car into reverse and sped away. Rock turned around and saw Carly’s pert ass hurrying across the forecourt towards Made by Rage. Oh yeah, baby, you can run, but you can’t fuckin’ hide, he thought to himself and gave an amused Lowrider a chin lift.“Wow, our kitten has claws,” Lowrider said, laughing.“Carly’s got a fuckin’ mouth,” Rock grunted, his own amusement showing.“In more ways than one brother,” Lowrider snorted and then threw his head back and roared with laughter.“Tellin’ me.” An expression of surprise crossed Lowrider’s face when Rock let out a chuckle.“Yeah,” Lowrider said, looking at him.“That bitch is mine,” Rock grunted again and, laughing to himself, returned to work. Run, baby, run. You can’t run fast enough, he thought.◆◆◆ “Oh my God, I kissed Rock! And Rock kissed me back, with tongue!” I exclaimed, running into Made by Rage, Designs by Lindsey. Embarrassed, I skidded to a halt and groaned as Drake’s eyebrows shot up. Apache sent me a surprised but definitely shit-eating grin. Both men had arms around their women, Drake around Phoe, and Apache around Silvie. Phoe had her hands full of Lindsey’s jewellery, and I guessed Phoe was in a buying mood, and Drake was not denying her that. Standing around was every single old lady Rage had.“Oh my God, was Rock good?” Silvie cried out and wheezed as Apache squeezed her.“Not sure what you want me to reply to that, kitten,” Apache drawled, replying to my first statement, and I turned red.“That wasn’t for you,” I replied, embarrassed.“Nope, I’m guessin’ not. Don’t wanna hear you share,” Drake said with more than a hint of humour in his voice.“Oh wow, can Rock kiss?” I felt myself go even redder as Lindsey vaulted the barrier in pure excitement. Apache quickly let go of Silvie to stop Lindsey from falling.“Oh, Rock can so kiss. And I bet with that beard it was hot!” Silvie yelped gleefully as Apache ducked his head.“And I’m outta here,” Drake said, giving Phoe a distracted kiss, distracted on her side as she clearly wished to get the gossip. Drake sighed, tilted Phoe’s head and looked into her eyes. Phoe’s eyes flared, and they kissed again. Far better, Drake’s expression said.“Comin’ with,” Apache said, hurrying out.“Carly kissed Rock? With tongue?” Sin breathed.“How, what happened? Tell us everything!” Penny gasped and dragged me through the barrier towards the staff seating area.“Well, I kissed Rock!” I squealed.“Got that,” said an amused voice, and Marsha and Artemis barrelled through the co-joined Rage Shop and Made by Rage wooden barrier. I spun on Artemis and hopped up and down.“Shit, I kissed Rock. I mean, I walked up to him, and I dragged his head down, and I kissed him!” I said in a high-pitched voice.“Oh my god, Carly, you started the kiss,” Phoe exclaimed.“I’m so proud of you!” Lindsey began jumping up and down as well. “My baby has grown up.”“Rock kiss you back? Hand action?” Ellen asked. Wow, Axel’s old lady was asking me about hand action.“Oh yeah, Rock kissed me back. So hot! I had my hands in his hair; it’s like silk,” I whispered.“Wow, you know, I always thought there was something between you,” Lindsey said. Silvie squealed and bounced on the spot.“I knew it; you’ve had the hots for Rock for years,” Sin squealed, and I glared. “It was magic!” I whispered, thinking of Rock’s mouth on mine.“Was there fireworks?” Autumn asked, settling on the arm of one chair. I blushed again.“There were fireworks,” Artemis nodded. “Ace is like that; intense sexiness and drool-worthy, and I just have to jump him and have hot monkey sex.”“No, I didn’t have hot monkey sex with Rock!” I shouted. “I kissed his ass off, though.”“Woah, wait, you were naked?” Marsha cried excitedly. No, no, they weren’t listening!“No, no nakedness. I wouldn’t mind seeing Rock naked, though. Damn, I bet he’s something naked.” I clapped a hand over my mouth. “What’s wrong with me!”“Um, Rock naked, yeah, I can imagine that. That tight ass, long legs, oh yeah Carly, I bet Rock’s something,” Artemis drawled.“I wanna see Rock naked now,” Phoe said, her eyes drifting off. Damn, did Phoe just say that?“Oh, me too. Rock has always been a yummy brother,” Marsha agreed.“All that smouldering intensity,” Ellen drooled.“I kissed that intensity; it was intense!” I yelped.“Rock kissed you back,” Artemis reminded me.“I climbed him like a tree,” I yelped again.“Oh my God, you climbed him? Hot monkey sex,” Artemis nodded sagely.“You’re not helping!” I cried as Artemis grinned wickedly. “Rock’s going to think I’m a harlot!”“Honey, the guys know you’re not a harlot,” Penny said, laughing. They did? I wasn’t sure about that; I’d been dating a few preppy boys lately, anything to get my mind off Rock.“Rock grabbed my ass and then pulled my leg up to hook around his thigh. I climbed him like a monkey. He’s so hard.” I sighed internally, my mouth just kept engaging.“Rock was hard?” Marsha giggled.“Oh my.” I blushed even more profoundly.“Holy shit. How big is he?” Autumn asked, and I swear she drooled.“Rock’s gonna think I’m a harlot!” I whispered. “I made him kiss me, and I climbed him like a monkey; I put my ass in his hands!”“How did you put your ass in his hands? It’s such a nice ass Carly,” Silvie asked curiously. She craned her head around me to look at my ass. This was getting worse; I couldn’t get my words out and wasn’t making sense.“Rock put his hands on me, and I wriggled my ass into them more!” I said softly.“Bettin’ Rock liked that,” Marsha said, nodding.“Honey, Rock likes you,” Ellen said. My head snapped up. Rock did? The man was one of the most remote brothers, so I knew little about him, except that I gravitated to him like a moth to a flame. Hold on, though…“Yes, but Rock didn’t ask me to force kiss him on the forecourt in front of Lowrider! I forced Rock to kiss me!” I said, panicking. “Oh my God, I attacked Rock and forced him to kiss me. I forced my ass into his hands and climbed him like a monkey. It was fuckin’ great.” I clapped my hands over my mouth again, “I didn’t say that, I didn’t say that!”“Yes, you did!” Lindsey cried gleefully. I was beginning to hate my boss.“In front of Lowrider?” Sin asked, and I nodded.“What did he do?” Lindsey asked.“Which one?” Autumn smirked. Okay, I was beginning to hate Autumn too.“No idea because I ran away when Rock pushed Richard into his car for calling me a whore.”“Rock pushed that dick headed twat?” Penny asked.“Richard called me a whore after I kissed Rock, and Rock then got manly and hard and pushed him into the car, yelling at Richard about Rage women. Again, it was freaking hot!”“Rock definitely likes you.” Silvie nodded her head.“Yeah, but that was before I forced Rock to kiss me.” I dropped my head in despair.“Honey, he wants you. Rock’s eyes get this sexy look when he stares at you,” Ellen stressed.“Rock wouldn’t have let you mount him if he didn’t,” Phoe said.“Oh shit, I did, I mounted him like riding a horse!”“Horse sex doesn’t have the same feel as monkey sex does,” Sin mused. I choked.“Bet Rock’s hung like a horse,” Phoe grinned.“Oh, he’s big.” I nodded.“Hung like a horse big?” Artemis asked slyly.“How the hell do I know? I don’t go around measuring horse dicks!” I shouted, embarrassed. Penny fell in the armchair, laughing her ass off.“I got to leave because I can’t face him,” I said and got instant no’s from the girls.“Rock will hunt you down if you do,” Silvie said, giggling.“If Rock’s hung like a horse, why on earth do you want to leave? You need to naked mount him! You need to ride his ass!” Artemis exclaimed. In horror, I stared at Artemis. Out of all the old ladies, we knew she was the kinkiest and most open about sex. We’d heard countless stories about hers and Ace’s sex life, and yeah, I’d been jealous.“I’m not riding Rock’s ass!” I squealed.“Sheesh, I don’t mean ride his ass, ride his ass, I mean give Rock reverse cowgirl or something,” Artemis grinned. “Ace loves reverse cowgirl; he does this thing with his finger….” Artemis broke off, and her eyes glazed over.“Lowrider does this thing with his finger and cock at the same time; it makes me melt. He’s so freaking hot,” Lindsey shared.“I’m not doing anything to Rock’s ass with my finger,” I said.Howls of male laughter erupted behind us. We gazed across the room to the glass doors that led into the Rage shop, and to my horror, I saw Gunner, Manny, Lowrider and Mac standing there. Mac was bent over laughing so hard, he was shaking, and he’d a phone in his hand.Gunner was holding on to the door laughing; I was struck by that; I’d never seen Gunner laugh. Lowrider was grinning like a monkey, and Manny was bent over like Mac laughing his ass off. They looked at our shocked expressions and carried on laughing. Finally, Mac straightened up and began tapping buttons on his phone.“Gotta send that shit to the guys,” Mac snorted, and before anyone could stop him, he hit send. Mac jumped the barrier, walked over, kissed me on my head and sauntered out.“Where did you record that from?” Phoe asked, her eyes narrowed.“Lindsey vaulting the barrier. Got that shit on tape,” Manny grunted, and the guys left them alone, still chuckling.“Ace will kick your ass,” Artemis shouted after them.“Ace will kick yours for tellin’ about his finger,” Lowrider shot back, and we heard his chuckle.“Your finger is banned from me,” Lindsey called.“Tell me tonight after I’ve done my finger thing,” Lowrider called back, and Lindsey huffed, but we saw the smile on her face. Yeah, Lowrider was still going to do his thing.",

      "content": "Chapter One.Rock heard laughter coming from the bay next to his and straightened up and looked over at Drake and Ace howling. He frowned and carried on tightening the bolts on the wheel he was replacing when they walked in his direction.“Brother, you not seen it?” Drake asked.“Seen what?” Rock grunted. He straightened back up and glanced over at Drake.“Check your phone for a message from Mac,” Ace said, smiling hugely. Rock still had trouble relating to this new Ace. The old version of Ace hadn’t smiled in years. This version smiled and laughed. That shit was weird, but Rock was happy for his brother. Idly contemplating Ace’s happiness, Rock wiped his hands on a rag and pulled his phone from a pocket.Curiously flicking it on, Rock saw a message from Mac and hit play. Rock’s mouth twitched in amusement as Drake and Ace came closer. Rock was full-on laughing when Marsha asked if he was hard. Ace and Drake were both laughing as Rock reached the end of the video. Rock hit replay and laughed all the way through it.“Those fuckin’ women,” Drake snorted.“Christ, that’s some funny shit,” Ace said.“Damn, you got your hands full with Artemis, brother,” Drake said, amused.“Woman loves her monkey sex. Thinks her pussy’s been abused if she don’t get it at least six times a week,” Ace laughed.“Too much info,” Rock grunted, but his eyes gave away his amusement.“Third set of twins coming up,” Drake teased, and Rock snorted.“Carly likes you,” Ace said. Christ, what was this? The male version of the women’s clatch?“Yeah,” Rock nodded; he wasn’t stupid; he’d seen the glances Carly sent his way. “Thirty-one. Had to wait for the girl to grow older.” Ace shot Rock a look.“Brother, you wanted Carly the moment she first walked into Rage.” “Think I hit that cunt pimp harder than you,” Rock replied.“Shit, the girl was eighteen.”“Nineteen now. Carly’s a woman, girl’s twenty next month.”“Unchartered territory,” Drake mused.“Know that brother, Carly’s held on to her virginity. Means when I take Carly, she’ll be tied to me tight,” Rock said. Ace looked at him with something close to amazement in his eyes.“Kept shit tight, brother,” Ace said, inclining his head.“No need to chat like pussy when girl weren’t mature enough. Made sure Carly’s stayed clean and safe. That kiss today, I know how Carly feels.” Rock turned on his heel and walked back to the bay. Drake turned away and grinned. Another brother about to fall. Good shit was happening for Rage. Drake looked across the forecourt and saw Phoe strutting her ass in her tight skirt and high heels into the HQ offices. Chance had been right. Ever since Phoe had landed on Rage, good things happened.Rock walked into the Made by Rage at five o’clock and saw Lindsey at her sewing machine and Silvie at the front desk. But, casually looking around, he didn’t see Carly. Puzzled, Rock walked through the barrier and stopped near Lindsey.“Where’s Carly?” Rock rumbled. Lindsey looked up with a grin.“Carly asked to finish early, said she had a doctor’s appointment. So she’ll be at home in truth.”“Girl’s running.”“Yeah,” Lindsey whispered. “Rock, you know….” “Yeah, I know, Lindsey.”“Carly’s never….” Rock bent over and got in Lindsey’s face.“Honey, I know Carly’s untouched. Gonna be gentle with her, babe,” Rock assured Lindsey, wondering why the fuck he was doing so. But then again, these women had their men by their dicks. The men knew it and honestly didn’t care. The men owned these women heart and soul and loved that. Rock straightened up and left the building.Rock rode to Carly’s piece of shit apartment. The girl refused to move out, desperately saving for a deposit on a sweet little house. Carly had first lived with Silvie and then in a cottage on Phoe and Drake’s estate before moving here four months ago. Rock had heard Carly speak about her dream, and he’d bought into it. The girl had a dream he wanted to see her live. Carly had walked into their lives nearly two years ago. She’d taken Lindsey’s back through her shit and then Silvie’s. Rock’s girl had loyalty.Carly was shy and mainly stayed away from forming relationships. But the women had developed their own sisterhood, and she’d been accepted into their circle. Lindsey and Silvie both had taken Carly under their wing. Carly was shy and skittish around most men, including his brothers. Still, as Rock had seen today, Carly had a temper, and it was fuckin’ attractive. How dickhead had got Carly to date him, Rock didn’t understand, but dickhead was gone from her life now.No one knew much concerning her private life. Carly hadn’t shared and clearly didn’t intend to. When Carly had turned up at Rage, she’d owned two pairs of jeans and three tees and a pair of battered sneakers. Lindsey had treated the girl well and bought her a shit load of clothes.Rock pulled up outside the apartment block and got off the bike. He jogged across the parking lot and waited to let a battered black SUV pass. Rock glanced up as it passed and saw Carly sitting inside, face pale and head tucked low. Then, as if Carly sensed him, Carly’s head snapped up, and her mouth opened slightly. Carly raised a hand to the window, and her slender fingers bent on the glass, and Carly looked at him. Rock sensed the sadness in her, and it hit deep. Carly held his eyes until the car passed him. Rock felt it, felt it deep. That was goodbye.◆◆◆ October 2016. Six months later.Rock heard the car pull up and lifted his head to look. An old nineteen seventy-five Chevrolet Vega in a fuckin’ awful mustard yellow clanked into a parking space. It was a rusting shit heap and a miracle it drove. Rock’s eyes met Lowriders across the forecourt, and he began walking out of the bay and stopped.One skinny jean-clad leg threw out of the car, and then a second and she got out. A good, easy forty pounds lighter than when she’d left. Her face was drawn and worn out, hair cropped short as if it had been cut with shears and clothes sagging from her frame. Arms so thin she resembled a skeleton. Carly stopped, tipped her head back, and breathed. The tension fell from her shoulders, and Carly relaxed instantly.Her gaze snapped across to his, and Carly stopped dead on the spot. The girl was pale, so ashen he was shocked. Rock stared for a few moments, turned his back on Carly, and walked to his bike. Throwing a leg over it, Rock rode out without a word.Sadly, I watched as Rock left me standing there. And I couldn’t blame him. Months had passed since I’d spoken to anyone from Rage. Not since my brothers arrived out of the blue and dragged me back to the previous horror of my life. They’d sold my phone before we even arrived back at the trailer. Yeah, I’d left because they’d been staking out Made by Rage and threatened to harm the girls.Blackmailed, I went home and once again cleaned up my brothers and father’s shit. Until three nights ago when my father choked to death on vomit, and I watched. And I didn’t call for help. No, I watched Dad watch me, watch him choke to death. Hate in both our eyes. Within minutes of Dad’s death, I packed up my stuff, took his piece of shit car, and drove into town to report it to the police. There, I spoke to them for fifteen minutes before they followed me back and carted him away. The cops didn’t care, my family were pieces of shit, and I didn’t care either, so I left.Escape looming before me, I traded Dad’s car and bought this one with cash and came to where I hoped home was. Lowrider stood watching me, and I glanced at him and saw his face was closed. Slowly, I walked over to Lowrider, trying to keep my feet and balance, and looked him in the face.“Shit’s over,” I told him. Lowrider blinked. “He’s dead, they’re safe, it’s finished. Totally over. And I’m free,” I said and blacked out.◆◆◆ Confused, I woke up in a soft bed and sniffed the air. Someone moved close by, and I braced for a blow, and someone cursed lightly. Oh, thank God, I knew that voice. It signalled safety. I opened my eyes and saw Lowrider sitting near me, Lindsey by his side. Drake and Silvie stood behind them and were watching me, their faces closed.Although it was warm, I was shivering in the bed violently, and I couldn’t get control of it. My head was killing me, and my muscles pained me, cramping as I moved. Bile rose in my throat, and I leant over the bed and threw up. That was a complete waste of time; I hadn’t eaten for days. As well as the pain in my head, it was foggy, and I couldn’t concentrate.“Carly?” Lowrider asked, crouching near the head of the bed.“Lowrider, safety,” I muttered. “Doc Paul’s visited; you’ve bronchitis, and he says pneumonia. Doc’s treating you with antibiotics,” Lowrider said. That hurt. Lowrider’s voice was distant, missing its usual warmth when he addressed me.“Let me sleep in a bed, not had a bed for months. Let me sleep once, and I’ll leave. Just give me tonight.”“Where you been sleepin’?” Drake asked harshly.“With the dogs in their shelter. Just give me tonight. Please,” I begged. Drake’s face hardened. Violently, I started shivering even worse and curled up in a ball. My nose was stuffy, and my eyes were swollen; I was amazed I could open them. My throat was on fire, which didn’t help matters. The truth was, I’d driven three days like this, concentrating hard on the road so not to cause an accident.Desperate to get home, I’d slept and eaten in the car, and I was down to my last three bucks. The only thing I understood was, I had to reach Rage. When Elrond and Barney had dragged me from here, they hadn’t got my bank cards as I left them at the shop in the safe. Back then, I’d had strange looks from the brothers but was thankful I’d done that now. There was money in the bank.Otis and Chester had been pissed when Elrond and Barney brought me back with no money. Elrond had assumed it was in my purse, and they had freaked when they realised I’d nothing but twenty bucks on me. Dad had given me a backhander when I gloated that Rage had my money. And then my shit life re-started.“In a dog’s shelter?” Silvie gasped.“One night. Just one night in a bed out of the last few months,” I whispered as my eyes closed and I fell back to sleep.◆◆◆ “What the fuck happened to Carly?” Lindsey asked, whirling on Lowrider the minute they got into the common room.“That’s a question I want answering,” Drake muttered. He was dialling Hawthorne as the girls let rip. Drake moved to one side to make a request of Hawthorne. When he turned back, the women were glaring furiously at the brothers.“Carly’s been fucked up,” Silvie ranted from the haven of Apache’s arms.“Carly’s been more than fucked up. Did you see those belt marks on her back?” Lindsey asked softly. Lowrider’s head snapped towards her.“What did you say?” Lowrider bit out. He and Drake had left the room when Doc Paul had examined Carly, and apart from a brusque description of her illness, he had said nothing else. But Doc had looked very pissed off and made one comment to Drake that hadn’t registered. “Stop this happening to your women.” Doc had said and left.“Carly’s been beaten; they’ll scar. Her thighs, ass, back, stomach bear the marks of being beaten with a belt. Welts are that severe; you can see the buckle marks in her skin. Doc Paul didn’t say anything?” Silvie whispered.“Say that again,” a voice growled, and they spun guiltily and saw Rock glowering angrily. Dangerous vibes hit the room, and the women took a step back.“Brother,” Drake said, and raised his hand and then dropped it.“Carly’s been beaten? Any answer to why she ran away from us?” Rock glowered.“Rock, I’m getting the idea Carly had little choice,” Lowrider said carefully. Rock turned in his direction.“No? Lowrider, I was right there. Carly could have given me a sign, and I would’ve followed.”“More to this shit than we understand,” Drake agreed.“Drake, I was right fuckin’ there,” Rock said louder, and Drake and Apache tensed, ready to lock him down.“Carly’s got pneumonia, bronchitis, she’s severely malnourished and dehydrated. Rock, Carly’s been abused,” Drake said firmly, his eyes watching Rock carefully.“With a belt?” Rock snapped, Lindsey nodded, and Apache moved closer. “Pneumonia?” Rock asked.“Bein’ treated, Doc Paul set up intravenous antibiotics. But Carly’s not just suffering from that,” Apache said.“Brief me,” Rock said, and it couldn’t be misconstrued as anything but a demand.◆◆◆ I came awake shivering again, and I was out of it. Somehow, I understood I was out of it, but I couldn’t concentrate on anything. There was a warm body in the bed next to me and strong arms wrapped around me. Happily, I burrowed into them and settled back down in warmth.Thirsty, I was so thirsty, I was begging for water. Someone held a glass to me, and I drank greedily, but they pulled it away before I got a few sips. Please, I begged and cried, and someone soothed me, and I chased the darkness again.Too hot, I kicked the blankets off, someone drew them back up me. No, I struggled and kicked them off a second time and begged for water. My eyes were so sore and swollen I couldn’t see shit. Water, I needed to drink, and the sheets were too hot. Maybe I told them that. Desperately, I told them not to get my brothers. The darkness swallowed me whole again.Confused, I woke up as someone shifted and wrapped me tight. Frightened, I struggled against them and stopped when a voice I dimly knew spoke to me. A glass touched my lips, and I drank water and burrowed into the warm solid body at my side. Hands touched my hair, and it felt nice. I told him that and other secret stuff and fell back to sleep.Jeez, I woke and threw up again. Crazily crying, I apologised, repeatedly begging them not to throw me outside where it was cold. I said I wasn’t sorry for watching Dad die and not getting help. Repeatedly, I said Dad deserved it. That the asshole beat me, and so I watched him die. Wasn’t it funny that I couldn’t call for help for Dad, as they’d sold my phone? I yelled I was gonna dance on Dad’s grave and party like there was no tomorrow.I told him it was safe for everyone, no one was watching Made by Rage, and it was safe. They could come out now. The truth was, I’d achieved what I’d set out to do. I’d saved the old ladies. My brothers wouldn’t harm them now because the asshole was dead. Shit was worth everything to see Silvie and Apache in love and to watch Lowrider vault over the barriers to kiss his wife. I had done it, made them safe. Arms clenched tightly around me.Babbling, I told him each hit from the belt didn’t hurt because I’d a home, a secret home I knew I return to safely. I screamed at them that they couldn’t take that away from me; I was liked there and loved. There, I had friends, they couldn’t take that from me, they could beat me till I bled, but they couldn’t take my home and friends. Sneakily I admitted the asshole could beat me until I was unconscious, but all he’d do is send me to heaven where that man was. The man with beautiful eyes and a smile that lit up my entire world.Happily, I talked about how I liked a guy, he was big and strong, and I’d kissed him once. Just once, and he’d let me climb him like a monkey. Like Ace let Artemis. The guy was everything drool-worthy in a man. Good and kind, funny and gentle, he was loyal and brave and loved his brothers and sometimes, when he looked at me, I felt special. That there was a link between him and me. I wanted under his skin like he was under mine. A chin rested on my head, and I was hauled across the bed into his arms. I told him it felt nice.◆◆◆ My eyes popped open, and I woke up alone and stretched. Damn, I felt better, Christ, did I feel better. The sheets were wrapped around my legs like I used to do as a child and tucked under my feet. My mouth tasted like I’d eaten an ashtray, and my eyes itched like they were on gritty stalks. I rubbed my eyes and tried to get the junk out of them. A glass of water sat on the side table, and I grabbed and drank it before sinking back into the bed.Crap, I was so damn weak, and I knew I’d lost even more weight. Unhappy, I looked at my arms, shocked to see how thin they were, whatever. So be it. The plan was to get to my bank, get my money, and leave Rapid City. Rage had made it pretty clear I wasn’t welcome. With that simple plan in mind, I climbed out of bed and realised I was in a bunk at Rage’s clubhouse. I gazed around a relatively tidy room that I didn’t know, I do stress relatively. Gingerly putting my feet on the floor, I ignored the chill and, sniffing, knew I needed a shower.My hand was sore and looking, I saw a canula inserted, and I followed the tubing of a drip up to a stand holding two nearly empty bags. With a shrug, I reached out and held onto the frame and began pushing it towards the bathroom. On the way, I stopped at the chest of drawers and pulled out a tee. Don’t know who it belonged to, and I didn’t care.The principal thing was the tee was clean, cleaner than me, and that was what mattered. I struggled with the stand but managed to get into the shower. I didn’t care which brother’s room I was in, so I used his shower gel and shampoo and borrowed his razor and shaved my legs and under my arms. Just doing those small things took my remaining strength. Warily, I looked in the cupboard over the sink but could only find one toothbrush.None of the brothers had fatal diseases that I knew about. Vigorously I brushed my teeth for a full five minutes. I couldn’t stop scrubbing. Finally, when my gums began to bleed, I stopped and rinsed. I found a comb and brushed it through my butchered hair. There was no point drying it as it would air-dry quickly. I dragged on the tee and found it a bit awkward as I had to thread the drips through the sleeve.A mirthless chuckle escaped me as the tee dropped to my knees. Cautiously, I left the bathroom after hanging my towel out and throwing the toothbrush in the bin. The room was still empty. The owner hadn’t returned. Unbalanced, I placed my hand against the wall and used my other hand to push the stand towards the door. Damn, I was shattered by the time I reached it, but I hadn’t given up when I got in the car; I would not give up now.I opened the door and began walking across the concrete floor towards the rec room. Muted laughter and chat drifted towards me, but I’d no idea of the time. Music was playing and getting louder as I got closer to the rec room. Carefully leaning on the wall, I stood in the entrance and swallowed back tears.The space looked no different, shabbier and possibly more cluttered, and the brothers were present. They slouched in chairs and sofas and sat at the bar. Apache and Ace, Artemis clinging to Ace’s back with arms and legs wrapped around him, played pool in the corner. Hunter and Blaze were having an aggressive game of air hockey. I checked and saw Lowrider in an armchair with Lindsey curled on his lap, his arms around her. Silvie was opposite them with Chance, the president of Hellfire and two of his brothers, Pyro and Banshee, better known as Shee. Two candidates, Klutz and Gauntlet, were serving Drake, Texas, Axel and Fish at the bar. Mac was flicking through TV channels even though the music was blaring, and Gunner lounged full length on another sofa. Autumn lay across his body. Manny and Slick looked to be playing chess, both deep in concentration.But I didn’t see Ezra, Lex, Marsha or the man who had been avoiding me, Rock. Phoe had her ass in Bear’s lap, the VP from Hellfire. I also spied Big Al and Chatter sitting relaxing, beer in hand, talking between themselves. Hurt, I clung to the wall hidden in shadows and wished I had a camera to take this snapshot, this snapshot of those I thought of as family.Sadly, I lifted my hand to wipe tears from my eyes, and my movement caught Drake’s sharp gaze. Within seconds, Drake strode over and placed an arm around my waist, supporting me. Drake took my weight and pulled me into him. I smelt leather, man and a scent that I only ever linked with Drake, home.Drake chucked me under the chin, so I lifted my head, and he searched my face. Whatever he saw satisfied him, and Drake lifted me as if I weighed nothing. At this point, I probably didn’t, and Drake carried me across the room. Eyes followed, and although they tracked our progress, no one said anything, just carried on with what they were doing.Drake placed me on an armchair in the old lady’s section near Lowrider, who gave me a warm wink. Lindsey dragged out a bag she had near her feet and passed me a ball of wool and a crochet hook. Confused, I stared for a few minutes, tears in my eyes, as I tried to grasp what Lindsey was telling me, and then I began casting on. A few minutes later, Blaze placed a coke near my chair on a rickety table and left me alone.Scared of believing, I kept my head down, concentrating on the wool, not knowing what to make of what was happening. My arrival had been met with tenseness and a vibe I was unwanted. Now I was settled in the midst of Rage and Hellfire, and no one was saying anything. My brain, although no longer foggy and muzzy, was definitely confused.The clubhouse doors opened, and in walked the missing members of Rage, Ezra, Lex, Marsha and Manny, followed by the missing old ladies. Behind them came three further Hellfire members, Tiny, Celt and Diesel. They carried bags, and the smell of Chinese wafted in my direction. They put the bags on the bar, and the candidates began handing out containers.My head remained dipped when suddenly, arms wrapped around me, and I was lifted and curled into muscled solid arms. My ass hit a lap, and those arms remained carefully tight around me. A beard nuzzled into my neck, and my startled eyes met Rock’s soft brown ones. Rock grinned and relaxed, drawing me close against his chest. Gently, Rock kept his arm away from the wounds on my back. Jett placed containers on a table, and reaching out with one hand, Rock snagged one.His other hand hanging over my shoulder snagged my wool, tucked it behind us, and Rock popped off the container lid. Rock grabbed the fork that Jett had put on top of the containers and forked up a mouthful of noodles, which he raised and held to my mouth. I looked at Rock in surprise.“Open up, babe,” Rock rumbled, and I sensed it deep in his chest. Obediently, I opened up and, like a baby bird, he fed me. Disbelievingly, I shook my head after a few bites, and Rock’s eyes narrowed, but he ate the rest. Next, Rock pulled out a container of prawn toast, which I loved, and a container of chicken satay on skewers. With a teasing air, Rock waved one under my nose, and I snatched it and bit into it. Watchful brown eyes gazed at me as I chewed and swallowed.“More?” Rock asked, and I nodded. Eating a second and third piece of prawn toast, I shook my head at the fourth offering. Eyes randomly checked on us, but no one commented. What was happening? Rock ate one-handed, keeping a hand around my waist and keeping me hooked against his chest. Okay, I leaned my head back and decided if this was a bizarre dream brought on by my illness, I was going to enjoy it.“What’s going on?” I whispered.“Shhh,” Rock said back and bit into a prawn toast. He chewed, and I watched his throat as he swallowed and fought the urge to kiss it. Not knowing where I stood, I behaved myself, but this was hard. This might be my dream, but I wouldn't risk embarrassing myself on the off chance I was reading this situation wrong. Rock glanced down and grinned at me as he read my face. “Go ahead, baby, all yours,” Rock whispered, tilting his head and putting his mouth against my ear. Rock dropped a kiss on the shell, and I shivered. His eyes flared, and I shivered again, and he took on a decidedly smug look.I looked around in bewilderment and saw sneaky glances and cheerful grins in our direction. Silvie looked beside herself, and Lindsey was happily grinning. Embarrassed, I tucked my head under Rock’s chin and closed my eyes. Yeah, I was going to accept this strange new reality, even if I only had tonight. Slowly, I allowed the chat to lull me into a light sleep.Startled, I opened my eyes as Rock lifted me in his arms and, pushing my stand, carried me back to the bedroom. He kicked the door open, carried me in, and laid me on the bed. Rock deftly swapped the two empty bags for full ones and hooked them up. And without saying a word, Rock opened the door and shouted through it to Blaze to get two toothbrushes.Still wordless, Rock stripped off his tee in front of my startled eyes, undid his jeans, and sat on the bed. He tugged off his boots and shucked his jeans, and finally, Rock lay on the bed next to me. With a twist, Rock curled me into his arms. By the time Rock wrapped me up tightly, I was drooling; he was ripped. A well-defined six-pack and pecs, hard tight nipples, and sparse hair trailed to a narrow line leading to his boxers. I glanced up, admiring his body.“You wouldn’t talk to me,” I said. Rock offered an uncomfortable nod. “What’s going on? How long was I out of it?”“Honey, you were out for four days. Doc Paul was ready to admit you when your fever broke, and you began stabilising.”“That answers one of my questions,” I said. Rock gave me a half-smile, and I stared at his mouth. Rock elaborated.“Carly, you’re home, you’re mine, and that’s what’s going on.”“Just like that?” I asked, stunned.“Babe, I watched and waited for two years for you to be comfortable in your skin and to come into your own. You strutted your ass across the forecourt, climbed me and kissed me like no bitch has ever kissed me before. Then before I could move on you, Carly, you drove away without a goodbye. Six months babe, six months we didn’t know where you were, no word, no call, no sighting. I got you back, ain’t letting go, and I’m laying claim to you. Waited long enough.”Wow, I blinked in surprise. Well, that answered the other two questions. I thought over Rock’s words, and as I did so, a hand slid up my back and gently pressed me harder into his side. Restless, my hand with the cannula crept up Rock’s muscular chest and stayed there. Under my hand, Rock’s heart beat steady and robust.“Claiming me for how long?” I asked softly.“Carly, I’m thirty-two; you’re twenty, should let you go to someone better. Someone who’ll give you the white picket fence and shit, not gonna. Carly, I see you, which means babe, I see you. Should let you live a little, not gonna, but I know you’re innocent, which means when you give yourself to me, you’re mine, for life. You got one chance, Carly. Tell me now to go, and I’ll walk. Still take your back but will leave you be, you don’t, you’re mine for good. Get me?” Dazed, I stared at him, really looked at him. Rock was a biker, a brother, and had been Rage for years. He was tall, over six foot two; I was five foot five. Rock towered over me and gave me the sensation of being safe, of being cherished. Rock was lean hipped with long muscled legs, broad shoulders, a broad chest, and a tight ass. He was covered in tattoos, but they weren’t off-putting.Rock’s face wasn’t classically handsome, but it was appealing and eye-catching. There was something compelling about Rock, something that drew a person’s eye. His eyes were a soft brown, and I’d seen them darkened in anger before. Rock’s hair was a shade too long and a dark rich brown, his beard the same. He kept it trimmed short, highlighting sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline.Those brown eyes were steady on mine; he didn’t speak, just let me think. Rock had many qualities I admired; he was funny, calm, steady, loyal, and so much more. He also was hot-tempered, quick to anger, blinkered when it came to his brothers and could be cruel. Rock had never been mean to me, but I’d seen him treat other women who got in his space, like shit.“I get it, babe,” Rock whispered, hope fading in his eyes. He bent and kissed my forehead before gathering his body to get off the bed. I gave a mew of discontent and my hand pressed against his chest. Hope flared again, and I curled into Rock and hooked my leg over his. Rock settled and, holding me tight, tucked his big body around me and held me until I slept.◆◆◆ I woke up to a hand stroking my stomach. The welts were faded now, still visible, but definitely faded. My tee had lifted during the night and was halfway up my torso. I blushed as I’d no underwear on, and I discovered Rock staring at the welts. Some of them would scar because they were so deep. Rock shifted on the bed and kissed each welt gently, and tears come to my eyes again. I moved my hand into Rock’s hair, and his head jerked up, and he looked into my eyes.“Carly, I’ll pay,” Rock said bizarrely, and I went stiff.“Pardon?” I asked sharply. Rock frowned.“I’ll pay for them to be removed; give you back your body.” I relaxed, and Rock looked at me, still puzzled.“Oh, I thought you meant….” I broke off blushing, and Rock shot me a grin. He was amused. Damn him, I just wanted to die in embarrassment.“Never paid for pussy before babe, as sweet as yours is, I’m not payin’ for yours either.”“I… yeah,” I whispered, embarrassed. Rock’s hand curved around my hip, and he laid his head on my stomach. I felt and heard a chuckle.“Babe, I’ll pay if you want them removed.”“I was thinking of having them tattooed over,” I said, and Rock glanced up and smiled. “I earned these Rock, protecting the old ladies, they mean something.” Rock scowled and when I flinched, smoothed it away.“That would be something. A couple of Hellfire do ink. Skilled ink. Can talk to them.” “Well, I’d need to think on designs and save money first,” I mumbled.“I’ll pay.”“No Rock, I’ll pay.”“You mine?” I nodded. “Then I’ll pay; I look after my woman. Carly, you’ll have what you need and want. And I’ll get what I need and want from you. But you gotta let me give you what you need and want. Not gonna fight you over it,” he said against my stomach. Rock twisted his head and dropped a kiss on my pubic bone. I stiffened, and then his head turned, and he kissed my stomach again. Rock shifted his weight and rolled me onto my stomach.Rock pulled the tee right up to my shoulders and stared at my naked back. I wriggled in embarrassment and tried to pull a sheet up. His big hand stopped me, and then I felt his lips kissing each welt and scar on my back, moving downwards to my ass and then my thighs.When he had finished kissing every wound, he drew himself up and wrapped his arms around me, enveloping me in his big body. It should have been threatening; it wasn’t. In this man’s arms, pain, hate and despair would never touch me again.",

      "content": "Chapter One.Rock heard laughter coming from the bay next to his and straightened up and looked over at Drake and Ace howling. He frowned and carried on tightening the bolts on the wheel he was replacing when they walked in his direction.“Brother, you not seen it?” Drake asked.“Seen what?” Rock grunted. He straightened back up and glanced over at Drake.“Check your phone for a message from Mac,” Ace said, smiling hugely. Rock still had trouble relating to this new Ace. The old version of Ace hadn’t smiled in years. This version smiled and laughed. That shit was weird, but Rock was happy for his brother. Idly contemplating Ace’s happiness, Rock wiped his hands on a rag and pulled his phone from a pocket.Curiously flicking it on, Rock saw a message from Mac and hit play. Rock’s mouth twitched in amusement as Drake and Ace came closer. Rock was full-on laughing when Marsha asked if he was hard. Ace and Drake were both laughing as Rock reached the end of the video. Rock hit replay and laughed all the way through it.“Those fuckin’ women,” Drake snorted.“Christ, that’s some funny shit,” Ace said.“Damn, you got your hands full with Artemis, brother,” Drake said, amused.“Woman loves her monkey sex. Thinks her pussy’s been abused if she don’t get it at least six times a week,” Ace laughed.“Too much info,” Rock grunted, but his eyes gave away his amusement.“Third set of twins coming up,” Drake teased, and Rock snorted.“Carly likes you,” Ace said. Christ, what was this? The male version of the women’s clatch?“Yeah,” Rock nodded; he wasn’t stupid; he’d seen the glances Carly sent his way. “Thirty-one. Had to wait for the girl to grow older.” Ace shot Rock a look.“Brother, you wanted Carly the moment she first walked into Rage.” “Think I hit that cunt pimp harder than you,” Rock replied.“Shit, the girl was eighteen.”“Nineteen now. Carly’s a woman, girl’s twenty next month.”“Unchartered territory,” Drake mused.“Know that brother, Carly’s held on to her virginity. Means when I take Carly, she’ll be tied to me tight,” Rock said. Ace looked at him with something close to amazement in his eyes.“Kept shit tight, brother,” Ace said, inclining his head.“No need to chat like pussy when girl weren’t mature enough. Made sure Carly’s stayed clean and safe. That kiss today, I know how Carly feels.” Rock turned on his heel and walked back to the bay. Drake turned away and grinned. Another brother about to fall. Good shit was happening for Rage. Drake looked across the forecourt and saw Phoe strutting her ass in her tight skirt and high heels into the HQ offices. Chance had been right. Ever since Phoe had landed on Rage, good things happened.Rock walked into the Made by Rage at five o’clock and saw Lindsey at her sewing machine and Silvie at the front desk. But, casually looking around, he didn’t see Carly. Puzzled, Rock walked through the barrier and stopped near Lindsey.“Where’s Carly?” Rock rumbled. Lindsey looked up with a grin.“Carly asked to finish early, said she had a doctor’s appointment. So she’ll be at home in truth.”“Girl’s running.”“Yeah,” Lindsey whispered. “Rock, you know….” “Yeah, I know, Lindsey.”“Carly’s never….” Rock bent over and got in Lindsey’s face.“Honey, I know Carly’s untouched. Gonna be gentle with her, babe,” Rock assured Lindsey, wondering why the fuck he was doing so. But then again, these women had their men by their dicks. The men knew it and honestly didn’t care. The men owned these women heart and soul and loved that. Rock straightened up and left the building.Rock rode to Carly’s piece of shit apartment. The girl refused to move out, desperately saving for a deposit on a sweet little house. Carly had first lived with Silvie and then in a cottage on Phoe and Drake’s estate before moving here four months ago. Rock had heard Carly speak about her dream, and he’d bought into it. The girl had a dream he wanted to see her live. Carly had walked into their lives nearly two years ago. She’d taken Lindsey’s back through her shit and then Silvie’s. Rock’s girl had loyalty.Carly was shy and mainly stayed away from forming relationships. But the women had developed their own sisterhood, and she’d been accepted into their circle. Lindsey and Silvie both had taken Carly under their wing. Carly was shy and skittish around most men, including his brothers. Still, as Rock had seen today, Carly had a temper, and it was fuckin’ attractive. How dickhead had got Carly to date him, Rock didn’t understand, but dickhead was gone from her life now.No one knew much concerning her private life. Carly hadn’t shared and clearly didn’t intend to. When Carly had turned up at Rage, she’d owned two pairs of jeans and three tees and a pair of battered sneakers. Lindsey had treated the girl well and bought her a shit load of clothes.Rock pulled up outside the apartment block and got off the bike. He jogged across the parking lot and waited to let a battered black SUV pass. Rock glanced up as it passed and saw Carly sitting inside, face pale and head tucked low. Then, as if Carly sensed him, Carly’s head snapped up, and her mouth opened slightly. Carly raised a hand to the window, and her slender fingers bent on the glass, and Carly looked at him. Rock sensed the sadness in her, and it hit deep. Carly held his eyes until the car passed him. Rock felt it, felt it deep. That was goodbye.◆◆◆ October 2016. Six months later.Rock heard the car pull up and lifted his head to look. An old nineteen seventy-five Chevrolet Vega in a fuckin’ awful mustard yellow clanked into a parking space. It was a rusting shit heap and a miracle it drove. Rock’s eyes met Lowriders across the forecourt, and he began walking out of the bay and stopped.One skinny jean-clad leg threw out of the car, and then a second and she got out. A good, easy forty pounds lighter than when she’d left. Her face was drawn and worn out, hair cropped short as if it had been cut with shears and clothes sagging from her frame. Arms so thin she resembled a skeleton. Carly stopped, tipped her head back, and breathed. The tension fell from her shoulders, and Carly relaxed instantly.Her gaze snapped across to his, and Carly stopped dead on the spot. The girl was pale, so ashen he was shocked. Rock stared for a few moments, turned his back on Carly, and walked to his bike. Throwing a leg over it, Rock rode out without a word.Sadly, I watched as Rock left me standing there. And I couldn’t blame him. Months had passed since I’d spoken to anyone from Rage. Not since my brothers arrived out of the blue and dragged me back to the previous horror of my life. They’d sold my phone before we even arrived back at the trailer. Yeah, I’d left because they’d been staking out Made by Rage and threatened to harm the girls.Blackmailed, I went home and once again cleaned up my brothers and father’s shit. Until three nights ago when my father choked to death on vomit, and I watched. And I didn’t call for help. No, I watched Dad watch me, watch him choke to death. Hate in both our eyes. Within minutes of Dad’s death, I packed up my stuff, took his piece of shit car, and drove into town to report it to the police. There, I spoke to them for fifteen minutes before they followed me back and carted him away. The cops didn’t care, my family were pieces of shit, and I didn’t care either, so I left.Escape looming before me, I traded Dad’s car and bought this one with cash and came to where I hoped home was. Lowrider stood watching me, and I glanced at him and saw his face was closed. Slowly, I walked over to Lowrider, trying to keep my feet and balance, and looked him in the face.“Shit’s over,” I told him. Lowrider blinked. “He’s dead, they’re safe, it’s finished. Totally over. And I’m free,” I said and blacked out.◆◆◆ Confused, I woke up in a soft bed and sniffed the air. Someone moved close by, and I braced for a blow, and someone cursed lightly. Oh, thank God, I knew that voice. It signalled safety. I opened my eyes and saw Lowrider sitting near me, Lindsey by his side. Drake and Silvie stood behind them and were watching me, their faces closed.Although it was warm, I was shivering in the bed violently, and I couldn’t get control of it. My head was killing me, and my muscles pained me, cramping as I moved. Bile rose in my throat, and I leant over the bed and threw up. That was a complete waste of time; I hadn’t eaten for days. As well as the pain in my head, it was foggy, and I couldn’t concentrate.“Carly?” Lowrider asked, crouching near the head of the bed.“Lowrider, safety,” I muttered. “Doc Paul’s visited; you’ve bronchitis, and he says pneumonia. Doc’s treating you with antibiotics,” Lowrider said. That hurt. Lowrider’s voice was distant, missing its usual warmth when he addressed me.“Let me sleep in a bed, not had a bed for months. Let me sleep once, and I’ll leave. Just give me tonight.”“Where you been sleepin’?” Drake asked harshly.“With the dogs in their shelter. Just give me tonight. Please,” I begged. Drake’s face hardened. Violently, I started shivering even worse and curled up in a ball. My nose was stuffy, and my eyes were swollen; I was amazed I could open them. My throat was on fire, which didn’t help matters. The truth was, I’d driven three days like this, concentrating hard on the road so not to cause an accident.Desperate to get home, I’d slept and eaten in the car, and I was down to my last three bucks. The only thing I understood was, I had to reach Rage. When Elrond and Barney had dragged me from here, they hadn’t got my bank cards as I left them at the shop in the safe. Back then, I’d had strange looks from the brothers but was thankful I’d done that now. There was money in the bank.Otis and Chester had been pissed when Elrond and Barney brought me back with no money. Elrond had assumed it was in my purse, and they had freaked when they realised I’d nothing but twenty bucks on me. Dad had given me a backhander when I gloated that Rage had my money. And then my shit life re-started.“In a dog’s shelter?” Silvie gasped.“One night. Just one night in a bed out of the last few months,” I whispered as my eyes closed and I fell back to sleep.◆◆◆ “What the fuck happened to Carly?” Lindsey asked, whirling on Lowrider the minute they got into the common room.“That’s a question I want answering,” Drake muttered. He was dialling Hawthorne as the girls let rip. Drake moved to one side to make a request of Hawthorne. When he turned back, the women were glaring furiously at the brothers.“Carly’s been fucked up,” Silvie ranted from the haven of Apache’s arms.“Carly’s been more than fucked up. Did you see those belt marks on her back?” Lindsey asked softly. Lowrider’s head snapped towards her.“What did you say?” Lowrider bit out. He and Drake had left the room when Doc Paul had examined Carly, and apart from a brusque description of her illness, he had said nothing else. But Doc had looked very pissed off and made one comment to Drake that hadn’t registered. “Stop this happening to your women.” Doc had said and left.“Carly’s been beaten; they’ll scar. Her thighs, ass, back, stomach bear the marks of being beaten with a belt. Welts are that severe; you can see the buckle marks in her skin. Doc Paul didn’t say anything?” Silvie whispered.“Say that again,” a voice growled, and they spun guiltily and saw Rock glowering angrily. Dangerous vibes hit the room, and the women took a step back.“Brother,” Drake said, and raised his hand and then dropped it.“Carly’s been beaten? Any answer to why she ran away from us?” Rock glowered.“Rock, I’m getting the idea Carly had little choice,” Lowrider said carefully. Rock turned in his direction.“No? Lowrider, I was right there. Carly could have given me a sign, and I would’ve followed.”“More to this shit than we understand,” Drake agreed.“Drake, I was right fuckin’ there,” Rock said louder, and Drake and Apache tensed, ready to lock him down.“Carly’s got pneumonia, bronchitis, she’s severely malnourished and dehydrated. Rock, Carly’s been abused,” Drake said firmly, his eyes watching Rock carefully.“With a belt?” Rock snapped, Lindsey nodded, and Apache moved closer. “Pneumonia?” Rock asked.“Bein’ treated, Doc Paul set up intravenous antibiotics. But Carly’s not just suffering from that,” Apache said.“Brief me,” Rock said, and it couldn’t be misconstrued as anything but a demand.◆◆◆ I came awake shivering again, and I was out of it. Somehow, I understood I was out of it, but I couldn’t concentrate on anything. There was a warm body in the bed next to me and strong arms wrapped around me. Happily, I burrowed into them and settled back down in warmth.Thirsty, I was so thirsty, I was begging for water. Someone held a glass to me, and I drank greedily, but they pulled it away before I got a few sips. Please, I begged and cried, and someone soothed me, and I chased the darkness again.Too hot, I kicked the blankets off, someone drew them back up me. No, I struggled and kicked them off a second time and begged for water. My eyes were so sore and swollen I couldn’t see shit. Water, I needed to drink, and the sheets were too hot. Maybe I told them that. Desperately, I told them not to get my brothers. The darkness swallowed me whole again.Confused, I woke up as someone shifted and wrapped me tight. Frightened, I struggled against them and stopped when a voice I dimly knew spoke to me. A glass touched my lips, and I drank water and burrowed into the warm solid body at my side. Hands touched my hair, and it felt nice. I told him that and other secret stuff and fell back to sleep.Jeez, I woke and threw up again. Crazily crying, I apologised, repeatedly begging them not to throw me outside where it was cold. I said I wasn’t sorry for watching Dad die and not getting help. Repeatedly, I said Dad deserved it. That the asshole beat me, and so I watched him die. Wasn’t it funny that I couldn’t call for help for Dad, as they’d sold my phone? I yelled I was gonna dance on Dad’s grave and party like there was no tomorrow.I told him it was safe for everyone, no one was watching Made by Rage, and it was safe. They could come out now. The truth was, I’d achieved what I’d set out to do. I’d saved the old ladies. My brothers wouldn’t harm them now because the asshole was dead. Shit was worth everything to see Silvie and Apache in love and to watch Lowrider vault over the barriers to kiss his wife. I had done it, made them safe. Arms clenched tightly around me.Babbling, I told him each hit from the belt didn’t hurt because I’d a home, a secret home I knew I return to safely. I screamed at them that they couldn’t take that away from me; I was liked there and loved. There, I had friends, they couldn’t take that from me, they could beat me till I bled, but they couldn’t take my home and friends. Sneakily I admitted the asshole could beat me until I was unconscious, but all he’d do is send me to heaven where that man was. The man with beautiful eyes and a smile that lit up my entire world.Happily, I talked about how I liked a guy, he was big and strong, and I’d kissed him once. Just once, and he’d let me climb him like a monkey. Like Ace let Artemis. The guy was everything drool-worthy in a man. Good and kind, funny and gentle, he was loyal and brave and loved his brothers and sometimes, when he looked at me, I felt special. That there was a link between him and me. I wanted under his skin like he was under mine. A chin rested on my head, and I was hauled across the bed into his arms. I told him it felt nice.◆◆◆ My eyes popped open, and I woke up alone and stretched. Damn, I felt better, Christ, did I feel better. The sheets were wrapped around my legs like I used to do as a child and tucked under my feet. My mouth tasted like I’d eaten an ashtray, and my eyes itched like they were on gritty stalks. I rubbed my eyes and tried to get the junk out of them. A glass of water sat on the side table, and I grabbed and drank it before sinking back into the bed.Crap, I was so damn weak, and I knew I’d lost even more weight. Unhappy, I looked at my arms, shocked to see how thin they were, whatever. So be it. The plan was to get to my bank, get my money, and leave Rapid City. Rage had made it pretty clear I wasn’t welcome. With that simple plan in mind, I climbed out of bed and realised I was in a bunk at Rage’s clubhouse. I gazed around a relatively tidy room that I didn’t know, I do stress relatively. Gingerly putting my feet on the floor, I ignored the chill and, sniffing, knew I needed a shower.My hand was sore and looking, I saw a canula inserted, and I followed the tubing of a drip up to a stand holding two nearly empty bags. With a shrug, I reached out and held onto the frame and began pushing it towards the bathroom. On the way, I stopped at the chest of drawers and pulled out a tee. Don’t know who it belonged to, and I didn’t care.The principal thing was the tee was clean, cleaner than me, and that was what mattered. I struggled with the stand but managed to get into the shower. I didn’t care which brother’s room I was in, so I used his shower gel and shampoo and borrowed his razor and shaved my legs and under my arms. Just doing those small things took my remaining strength. Warily, I looked in the cupboard over the sink but could only find one toothbrush.None of the brothers had fatal diseases that I knew about. Vigorously I brushed my teeth for a full five minutes. I couldn’t stop scrubbing. Finally, when my gums began to bleed, I stopped and rinsed. I found a comb and brushed it through my butchered hair. There was no point drying it as it would air-dry quickly. I dragged on the tee and found it a bit awkward as I had to thread the drips through the sleeve.A mirthless chuckle escaped me as the tee dropped to my knees. Cautiously, I left the bathroom after hanging my towel out and throwing the toothbrush in the bin. The room was still empty. The owner hadn’t returned. Unbalanced, I placed my hand against the wall and used my other hand to push the stand towards the door. Damn, I was shattered by the time I reached it, but I hadn’t given up when I got in the car; I would not give up now.I opened the door and began walking across the concrete floor towards the rec room. Muted laughter and chat drifted towards me, but I’d no idea of the time. Music was playing and getting louder as I got closer to the rec room. Carefully leaning on the wall, I stood in the entrance and swallowed back tears.The space looked no different, shabbier and possibly more cluttered, and the brothers were present. They slouched in chairs and sofas and sat at the bar. Apache and Ace, Artemis clinging to Ace’s back with arms and legs wrapped around him, played pool in the corner. Hunter and Blaze were having an aggressive game of air hockey. I checked and saw Lowrider in an armchair with Lindsey curled on his lap, his arms around her. Silvie was opposite them with Chance, the president of Hellfire and two of his brothers, Pyro and Banshee, better known as Shee. Two candidates, Klutz and Gauntlet, were serving Drake, Texas, Axel and Fish at the bar. Mac was flicking through TV channels even though the music was blaring, and Gunner lounged full length on another sofa. Autumn lay across his body. Manny and Slick looked to be playing chess, both deep in concentration.But I didn’t see Ezra, Lex, Marsha or the man who had been avoiding me, Rock. Phoe had her ass in Bear’s lap, the VP from Hellfire. I also spied Big Al and Chatter sitting relaxing, beer in hand, talking between themselves. Hurt, I clung to the wall hidden in shadows and wished I had a camera to take this snapshot, this snapshot of those I thought of as family.Sadly, I lifted my hand to wipe tears from my eyes, and my movement caught Drake’s sharp gaze. Within seconds, Drake strode over and placed an arm around my waist, supporting me. Drake took my weight and pulled me into him. I smelt leather, man and a scent that I only ever linked with Drake, home.Drake chucked me under the chin, so I lifted my head, and he searched my face. Whatever he saw satisfied him, and Drake lifted me as if I weighed nothing. At this point, I probably didn’t, and Drake carried me across the room. Eyes followed, and although they tracked our progress, no one said anything, just carried on with what they were doing.Drake placed me on an armchair in the old lady’s section near Lowrider, who gave me a warm wink. Lindsey dragged out a bag she had near her feet and passed me a ball of wool and a crochet hook. Confused, I stared for a few minutes, tears in my eyes, as I tried to grasp what Lindsey was telling me, and then I began casting on. A few minutes later, Blaze placed a coke near my chair on a rickety table and left me alone.Scared of believing, I kept my head down, concentrating on the wool, not knowing what to make of what was happening. My arrival had been met with tenseness and a vibe I was unwanted. Now I was settled in the midst of Rage and Hellfire, and no one was saying anything. My brain, although no longer foggy and muzzy, was definitely confused.The clubhouse doors opened, and in walked the missing members of Rage, Ezra, Lex, Marsha and Manny, followed by the missing old ladies. Behind them came three further Hellfire members, Tiny, Celt and Diesel. They carried bags, and the smell of Chinese wafted in my direction. They put the bags on the bar, and the candidates began handing out containers.My head remained dipped when suddenly, arms wrapped around me, and I was lifted and curled into muscled solid arms. My ass hit a lap, and those arms remained carefully tight around me. A beard nuzzled into my neck, and my startled eyes met Rock’s soft brown ones. Rock grinned and relaxed, drawing me close against his chest. Gently, Rock kept his arm away from the wounds on my back. Jett placed containers on a table, and reaching out with one hand, Rock snagged one.His other hand hanging over my shoulder snagged my wool, tucked it behind us, and Rock popped off the container lid. Rock grabbed the fork that Jett had put on top of the containers and forked up a mouthful of noodles, which he raised and held to my mouth. I looked at Rock in surprise.“Open up, babe,” Rock rumbled, and I sensed it deep in his chest. Obediently, I opened up and, like a baby bird, he fed me. Disbelievingly, I shook my head after a few bites, and Rock’s eyes narrowed, but he ate the rest. Next, Rock pulled out a container of prawn toast, which I loved, and a container of chicken satay on skewers. With a teasing air, Rock waved one under my nose, and I snatched it and bit into it. Watchful brown eyes gazed at me as I chewed and swallowed.“More?” Rock asked, and I nodded. Eating a second and third piece of prawn toast, I shook my head at the fourth offering. Eyes randomly checked on us, but no one commented. What was happening? Rock ate one-handed, keeping a hand around my waist and keeping me hooked against his chest. Okay, I leaned my head back and decided if this was a bizarre dream brought on by my illness, I was going to enjoy it.“What’s going on?” I whispered.“Shhh,” Rock said back and bit into a prawn toast. He chewed, and I watched his throat as he swallowed and fought the urge to kiss it. Not knowing where I stood, I behaved myself, but this was hard. This might be my dream, but I wouldn't risk embarrassing myself on the off chance I was reading this situation wrong. Rock glanced down and grinned at me as he read my face. “Go ahead, baby, all yours,” Rock whispered, tilting his head and putting his mouth against my ear. Rock dropped a kiss on the shell, and I shivered. His eyes flared, and I shivered again, and he took on a decidedly smug look.I looked around in bewilderment and saw sneaky glances and cheerful grins in our direction. Silvie looked beside herself, and Lindsey was happily grinning. Embarrassed, I tucked my head under Rock’s chin and closed my eyes. Yeah, I was going to accept this strange new reality, even if I only had tonight. Slowly, I allowed the chat to lull me into a light sleep.Startled, I opened my eyes as Rock lifted me in his arms and, pushing my stand, carried me back to the bedroom. He kicked the door open, carried me in, and laid me on the bed. Rock deftly swapped the two empty bags for full ones and hooked them up. And without saying a word, Rock opened the door and shouted through it to Blaze to get two toothbrushes.Still wordless, Rock stripped off his tee in front of my startled eyes, undid his jeans, and sat on the bed. He tugged off his boots and shucked his jeans, and finally, Rock lay on the bed next to me. With a twist, Rock curled me into his arms. By the time Rock wrapped me up tightly, I was drooling; he was ripped. A well-defined six-pack and pecs, hard tight nipples, and sparse hair trailed to a narrow line leading to his boxers. I glanced up, admiring his body.“You wouldn’t talk to me,” I said. Rock offered an uncomfortable nod. “What’s going on? How long was I out of it?”“Honey, you were out for four days. Doc Paul was ready to admit you when your fever broke, and you began stabilising.”“That answers one of my questions,” I said. Rock gave me a half-smile, and I stared at his mouth. Rock elaborated.“Carly, you’re home, you’re mine, and that’s what’s going on.”“Just like that?” I asked, stunned.“Babe, I watched and waited for two years for you to be comfortable in your skin and to come into your own. You strutted your ass across the forecourt, climbed me and kissed me like no bitch has ever kissed me before. Then before I could move on you, Carly, you drove away without a goodbye. Six months babe, six months we didn’t know where you were, no word, no call, no sighting. I got you back, ain’t letting go, and I’m laying claim to you. Waited long enough.”Wow, I blinked in surprise. Well, that answered the other two questions. I thought over Rock’s words, and as I did so, a hand slid up my back and gently pressed me harder into his side. Restless, my hand with the cannula crept up Rock’s muscular chest and stayed there. Under my hand, Rock’s heart beat steady and robust.“Claiming me for how long?” I asked softly.“Carly, I’m thirty-two; you’re twenty, should let you go to someone better. Someone who’ll give you the white picket fence and shit, not gonna. Carly, I see you, which means babe, I see you. Should let you live a little, not gonna, but I know you’re innocent, which means when you give yourself to me, you’re mine, for life. You got one chance, Carly. Tell me now to go, and I’ll walk. Still take your back but will leave you be, you don’t, you’re mine for good. Get me?” Dazed, I stared at him, really looked at him. Rock was a biker, a brother, and had been Rage for years. He was tall, over six foot two; I was five foot five. Rock towered over me and gave me the sensation of being safe, of being cherished. Rock was lean hipped with long muscled legs, broad shoulders, a broad chest, and a tight ass. He was covered in tattoos, but they weren’t off-putting.Rock’s face wasn’t classically handsome, but it was appealing and eye-catching. There was something compelling about Rock, something that drew a person’s eye. His eyes were a soft brown, and I’d seen them darkened in anger before. Rock’s hair was a shade too long and a dark rich brown, his beard the same. He kept it trimmed short, highlighting sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline.Those brown eyes were steady on mine; he didn’t speak, just let me think. Rock had many qualities I admired; he was funny, calm, steady, loyal, and so much more. He also was hot-tempered, quick to anger, blinkered when it came to his brothers and could be cruel. Rock had never been mean to me, but I’d seen him treat other women who got in his space, like shit.“I get it, babe,” Rock whispered, hope fading in his eyes. He bent and kissed my forehead before gathering his body to get off the bed. I gave a mew of discontent and my hand pressed against his chest. Hope flared again, and I curled into Rock and hooked my leg over his. Rock settled and, holding me tight, tucked his big body around me and held me until I slept.◆◆◆ I woke up to a hand stroking my stomach. The welts were faded now, still visible, but definitely faded. My tee had lifted during the night and was halfway up my torso. I blushed as I’d no underwear on, and I discovered Rock staring at the welts. Some of them would scar because they were so deep. Rock shifted on the bed and kissed each welt gently, and tears come to my eyes again. I moved my hand into Rock’s hair, and his head jerked up, and he looked into my eyes.“Carly, I’ll pay,” Rock said bizarrely, and I went stiff.“Pardon?” I asked sharply. Rock frowned.“I’ll pay for them to be removed; give you back your body.” I relaxed, and Rock looked at me, still puzzled.“Oh, I thought you meant….” I broke off blushing, and Rock shot me a grin. He was amused. Damn him, I just wanted to die in embarrassment.“Never paid for pussy before babe, as sweet as yours is, I’m not payin’ for yours either.”“I… yeah,” I whispered, embarrassed. Rock’s hand curved around my hip, and he laid his head on my stomach. I felt and heard a chuckle.“Babe, I’ll pay if you want them removed.”“I was thinking of having them tattooed over,” I said, and Rock glanced up and smiled. “I earned these Rock, protecting the old ladies, they mean something.” Rock scowled and when I flinched, smoothed it away.“That would be something. A couple of Hellfire do ink. Skilled ink. Can talk to them.” “Well, I’d need to think on designs and save money first,” I mumbled.“I’ll pay.”“No Rock, I’ll pay.”“You mine?” I nodded. “Then I’ll pay; I look after my woman. Carly, you’ll have what you need and want. And I’ll get what I need and want from you. But you gotta let me give you what you need and want. Not gonna fight you over it,” he said against my stomach. Rock twisted his head and dropped a kiss on my pubic bone. I stiffened, and then his head turned, and he kissed my stomach again. Rock shifted his weight and rolled me onto my stomach.Rock pulled the tee right up to my shoulders and stared at my naked back. I wriggled in embarrassment and tried to pull a sheet up. His big hand stopped me, and then I felt his lips kissing each welt and scar on my back, moving downwards to my ass and then my thighs.When he had finished kissing every wound, he drew himself up and wrapped his arms around me, enveloping me in his big body. It should have been threatening; it wasn’t. In this man’s arms, pain, hate and despair would never touch me again.",

      "content": "Chapter One.Rock heard laughter coming from the bay next to his and straightened up and looked over at Drake and Ace howling. He frowned and carried on tightening the bolts on the wheel he was replacing when they walked in his direction.“Brother, you not seen it?” Drake asked.“Seen what?” Rock grunted. He straightened back up and glanced over at Drake.“Check your phone for a message from Mac,” Ace said, smiling hugely. Rock still had trouble relating to this new Ace. The old version of Ace hadn’t smiled in years. This version smiled and laughed. That shit was weird, but Rock was happy for his brother. Idly contemplating Ace’s happiness, Rock wiped his hands on a rag and pulled his phone from a pocket.Curiously flicking it on, Rock saw a message from Mac and hit play. Rock’s mouth twitched in amusement as Drake and Ace came closer. Rock was full-on laughing when Marsha asked if he was hard. Ace and Drake were both laughing as Rock reached the end of the video. Rock hit replay and laughed all the way through it.“Those fuckin’ women,” Drake snorted.“Christ, that’s some funny shit,” Ace said.“Damn, you got your hands full with Artemis, brother,” Drake said, amused.“Woman loves her monkey sex. Thinks her pussy’s been abused if she don’t get it at least six times a week,” Ace laughed.“Too much info,” Rock grunted, but his eyes gave away his amusement.“Third set of twins coming up,” Drake teased, and Rock snorted.“Carly likes you,” Ace said. Christ, what was this? The male version of the women’s clatch?“Yeah,” Rock nodded; he wasn’t stupid; he’d seen the glances Carly sent his way. “Thirty-one. Had to wait for the girl to grow older.” Ace shot Rock a look.“Brother, you wanted Carly the moment she first walked into Rage.” “Think I hit that cunt pimp harder than you,” Rock replied.“Shit, the girl was eighteen.”“Nineteen now. Carly’s a woman, girl’s twenty next month.”“Unchartered territory,” Drake mused.“Know that brother, Carly’s held on to her virginity. Means when I take Carly, she’ll be tied to me tight,” Rock said. Ace looked at him with something close to amazement in his eyes.“Kept shit tight, brother,” Ace said, inclining his head.“No need to chat like pussy when girl weren’t mature enough. Made sure Carly’s stayed clean and safe. That kiss today, I know how Carly feels.” Rock turned on his heel and walked back to the bay. Drake turned away and grinned. Another brother about to fall. Good shit was happening for Rage. Drake looked across the forecourt and saw Phoe strutting her ass in her tight skirt and high heels into the HQ offices. Chance had been right. Ever since Phoe had landed on Rage, good things happened.Rock walked into the Made by Rage at five o’clock and saw Lindsey at her sewing machine and Silvie at the front desk. But, casually looking around, he didn’t see Carly. Puzzled, Rock walked through the barrier and stopped near Lindsey.“Where’s Carly?” Rock rumbled. Lindsey looked up with a grin.“Carly asked to finish early, said she had a doctor’s appointment. So she’ll be at home in truth.”“Girl’s running.”“Yeah,” Lindsey whispered. “Rock, you know….” “Yeah, I know, Lindsey.”“Carly’s never….” Rock bent over and got in Lindsey’s face.“Honey, I know Carly’s untouched. Gonna be gentle with her, babe,” Rock assured Lindsey, wondering why the fuck he was doing so. But then again, these women had their men by their dicks. The men knew it and honestly didn’t care. The men owned these women heart and soul and loved that. Rock straightened up and left the building.Rock rode to Carly’s piece of shit apartment. The girl refused to move out, desperately saving for a deposit on a sweet little house. Carly had first lived with Silvie and then in a cottage on Phoe and Drake’s estate before moving here four months ago. Rock had heard Carly speak about her dream, and he’d bought into it. The girl had a dream he wanted to see her live. Carly had walked into their lives nearly two years ago. She’d taken Lindsey’s back through her shit and then Silvie’s. Rock’s girl had loyalty.Carly was shy and mainly stayed away from forming relationships. But the women had developed their own sisterhood, and she’d been accepted into their circle. Lindsey and Silvie both had taken Carly under their wing. Carly was shy and skittish around most men, including his brothers. Still, as Rock had seen today, Carly had a temper, and it was fuckin’ attractive. How dickhead had got Carly to date him, Rock didn’t understand, but dickhead was gone from her life now.No one knew much concerning her private life. Carly hadn’t shared and clearly didn’t intend to. When Carly had turned up at Rage, she’d owned two pairs of jeans and three tees and a pair of battered sneakers. Lindsey had treated the girl well and bought her a shit load of clothes.Rock pulled up outside the apartment block and got off the bike. He jogged across the parking lot and waited to let a battered black SUV pass. Rock glanced up as it passed and saw Carly sitting inside, face pale and head tucked low. Then, as if Carly sensed him, Carly’s head snapped up, and her mouth opened slightly. Carly raised a hand to the window, and her slender fingers bent on the glass, and Carly looked at him. Rock sensed the sadness in her, and it hit deep. Carly held his eyes until the car passed him. Rock felt it, felt it deep. That was goodbye.◆◆◆ October 2016. Six months later.Rock heard the car pull up and lifted his head to look. An old nineteen seventy-five Chevrolet Vega in a fuckin’ awful mustard yellow clanked into a parking space. It was a rusting shit heap and a miracle it drove. Rock’s eyes met Lowriders across the forecourt, and he began walking out of the bay and stopped.One skinny jean-clad leg threw out of the car, and then a second and she got out. A good, easy forty pounds lighter than when she’d left. Her face was drawn and worn out, hair cropped short as if it had been cut with shears and clothes sagging from her frame. Arms so thin she resembled a skeleton. Carly stopped, tipped her head back, and breathed. The tension fell from her shoulders, and Carly relaxed instantly.Her gaze snapped across to his, and Carly stopped dead on the spot. The girl was pale, so ashen he was shocked. Rock stared for a few moments, turned his back on Carly, and walked to his bike. Throwing a leg over it, Rock rode out without a word.Sadly, I watched as Rock left me standing there. And I couldn’t blame him. Months had passed since I’d spoken to anyone from Rage. Not since my brothers arrived out of the blue and dragged me back to the previous horror of my life. They’d sold my phone before we even arrived back at the trailer. Yeah, I’d left because they’d been staking out Made by Rage and threatened to harm the girls.Blackmailed, I went home and once again cleaned up my brothers and father’s shit. Until three nights ago when my father choked to death on vomit, and I watched. And I didn’t call for help. No, I watched Dad watch me, watch him choke to death. Hate in both our eyes. Within minutes of Dad’s death, I packed up my stuff, took his piece of shit car, and drove into town to report it to the police. There, I spoke to them for fifteen minutes before they followed me back and carted him away. The cops didn’t care, my family were pieces of shit, and I didn’t care either, so I left.Escape looming before me, I traded Dad’s car and bought this one with cash and came to where I hoped home was. Lowrider stood watching me, and I glanced at him and saw his face was closed. Slowly, I walked over to Lowrider, trying to keep my feet and balance, and looked him in the face.“Shit’s over,” I told him. Lowrider blinked. “He’s dead, they’re safe, it’s finished. Totally over. And I’m free,” I said and blacked out.◆◆◆ Confused, I woke up in a soft bed and sniffed the air. Someone moved close by, and I braced for a blow, and someone cursed lightly. Oh, thank God, I knew that voice. It signalled safety. I opened my eyes and saw Lowrider sitting near me, Lindsey by his side. Drake and Silvie stood behind them and were watching me, their faces closed.Although it was warm, I was shivering in the bed violently, and I couldn’t get control of it. My head was killing me, and my muscles pained me, cramping as I moved. Bile rose in my throat, and I leant over the bed and threw up. That was a complete waste of time; I hadn’t eaten for days. As well as the pain in my head, it was foggy, and I couldn’t concentrate.“Carly?” Lowrider asked, crouching near the head of the bed.“Lowrider, safety,” I muttered. “Doc Paul’s visited; you’ve bronchitis, and he says pneumonia. Doc’s treating you with antibiotics,” Lowrider said. That hurt. Lowrider’s voice was distant, missing its usual warmth when he addressed me.“Let me sleep in a bed, not had a bed for months. Let me sleep once, and I’ll leave. Just give me tonight.”“Where you been sleepin’?” Drake asked harshly.“With the dogs in their shelter. Just give me tonight. Please,” I begged. Drake’s face hardened. Violently, I started shivering even worse and curled up in a ball. My nose was stuffy, and my eyes were swollen; I was amazed I could open them. My throat was on fire, which didn’t help matters. The truth was, I’d driven three days like this, concentrating hard on the road so not to cause an accident.Desperate to get home, I’d slept and eaten in the car, and I was down to my last three bucks. The only thing I understood was, I had to reach Rage. When Elrond and Barney had dragged me from here, they hadn’t got my bank cards as I left them at the shop in the safe. Back then, I’d had strange looks from the brothers but was thankful I’d done that now. There was money in the bank.Otis and Chester had been pissed when Elrond and Barney brought me back with no money. Elrond had assumed it was in my purse, and they had freaked when they realised I’d nothing but twenty bucks on me. Dad had given me a backhander when I gloated that Rage had my money. And then my shit life re-started.“In a dog’s shelter?” Silvie gasped.“One night. Just one night in a bed out of the last few months,” I whispered as my eyes closed and I fell back to sleep.◆◆◆ “What the fuck happened to Carly?” Lindsey asked, whirling on Lowrider the minute they got into the common room.“That’s a question I want answering,” Drake muttered. He was dialling Hawthorne as the girls let rip. Drake moved to one side to make a request of Hawthorne. When he turned back, the women were glaring furiously at the brothers.“Carly’s been fucked up,” Silvie ranted from the haven of Apache’s arms.“Carly’s been more than fucked up. Did you see those belt marks on her back?” Lindsey asked softly. Lowrider’s head snapped towards her.“What did you say?” Lowrider bit out. He and Drake had left the room when Doc Paul had examined Carly, and apart from a brusque description of her illness, he had said nothing else. But Doc had looked very pissed off and made one comment to Drake that hadn’t registered. “Stop this happening to your women.” Doc had said and left.“Carly’s been beaten; they’ll scar. Her thighs, ass, back, stomach bear the marks of being beaten with a belt. Welts are that severe; you can see the buckle marks in her skin. Doc Paul didn’t say anything?” Silvie whispered.“Say that again,” a voice growled, and they spun guiltily and saw Rock glowering angrily. Dangerous vibes hit the room, and the women took a step back.“Brother,” Drake said, and raised his hand and then dropped it.“Carly’s been beaten? Any answer to why she ran away from us?” Rock glowered.“Rock, I’m getting the idea Carly had little choice,” Lowrider said carefully. Rock turned in his direction.“No? Lowrider, I was right there. Carly could have given me a sign, and I would’ve followed.”“More to this shit than we understand,” Drake agreed.“Drake, I was right fuckin’ there,” Rock said louder, and Drake and Apache tensed, ready to lock him down.“Carly’s got pneumonia, bronchitis, she’s severely malnourished and dehydrated. Rock, Carly’s been abused,” Drake said firmly, his eyes watching Rock carefully.“With a belt?” Rock snapped, Lindsey nodded, and Apache moved closer. “Pneumonia?” Rock asked.“Bein’ treated, Doc Paul set up intravenous antibiotics. But Carly’s not just suffering from that,” Apache said.“Brief me,” Rock said, and it couldn’t be misconstrued as anything but a demand.◆◆◆ I came awake shivering again, and I was out of it. Somehow, I understood I was out of it, but I couldn’t concentrate on anything. There was a warm body in the bed next to me and strong arms wrapped around me. Happily, I burrowed into them and settled back down in warmth.Thirsty, I was so thirsty, I was begging for water. Someone held a glass to me, and I drank greedily, but they pulled it away before I got a few sips. Please, I begged and cried, and someone soothed me, and I chased the darkness again.Too hot, I kicked the blankets off, someone drew them back up me. No, I struggled and kicked them off a second time and begged for water. My eyes were so sore and swollen I couldn’t see shit. Water, I needed to drink, and the sheets were too hot. Maybe I told them that. Desperately, I told them not to get my brothers. The darkness swallowed me whole again.Confused, I woke up as someone shifted and wrapped me tight. Frightened, I struggled against them and stopped when a voice I dimly knew spoke to me. A glass touched my lips, and I drank water and burrowed into the warm solid body at my side. Hands touched my hair, and it felt nice. I told him that and other secret stuff and fell back to sleep.Jeez, I woke and threw up again. Crazily crying, I apologised, repeatedly begging them not to throw me outside where it was cold. I said I wasn’t sorry for watching Dad die and not getting help. Repeatedly, I said Dad deserved it. That the asshole beat me, and so I watched him die. Wasn’t it funny that I couldn’t call for help for Dad, as they’d sold my phone? I yelled I was gonna dance on Dad’s grave and party like there was no tomorrow.I told him it was safe for everyone, no one was watching Made by Rage, and it was safe. They could come out now. The truth was, I’d achieved what I’d set out to do. I’d saved the old ladies. My brothers wouldn’t harm them now because the asshole was dead. Shit was worth everything to see Silvie and Apache in love and to watch Lowrider vault over the barriers to kiss his wife. I had done it, made them safe. Arms clenched tightly around me.Babbling, I told him each hit from the belt didn’t hurt because I’d a home, a secret home I knew I return to safely. I screamed at them that they couldn’t take that away from me; I was liked there and loved. There, I had friends, they couldn’t take that from me, they could beat me till I bled, but they couldn’t take my home and friends. Sneakily I admitted the asshole could beat me until I was unconscious, but all he’d do is send me to heaven where that man was. The man with beautiful eyes and a smile that lit up my entire world.Happily, I talked about how I liked a guy, he was big and strong, and I’d kissed him once. Just once, and he’d let me climb him like a monkey. Like Ace let Artemis. The guy was everything drool-worthy in a man. Good and kind, funny and gentle, he was loyal and brave and loved his brothers and sometimes, when he looked at me, I felt special. That there was a link between him and me. I wanted under his skin like he was under mine. A chin rested on my head, and I was hauled across the bed into his arms. I told him it felt nice.◆◆◆ My eyes popped open, and I woke up alone and stretched. Damn, I felt better, Christ, did I feel better. The sheets were wrapped around my legs like I used to do as a child and tucked under my feet. My mouth tasted like I’d eaten an ashtray, and my eyes itched like they were on gritty stalks. I rubbed my eyes and tried to get the junk out of them. A glass of water sat on the side table, and I grabbed and drank it before sinking back into the bed.Crap, I was so damn weak, and I knew I’d lost even more weight. Unhappy, I looked at my arms, shocked to see how thin they were, whatever. So be it. The plan was to get to my bank, get my money, and leave Rapid City. Rage had made it pretty clear I wasn’t welcome. With that simple plan in mind, I climbed out of bed and realised I was in a bunk at Rage’s clubhouse. I gazed around a relatively tidy room that I didn’t know, I do stress relatively. Gingerly putting my feet on the floor, I ignored the chill and, sniffing, knew I needed a shower.My hand was sore and looking, I saw a canula inserted, and I followed the tubing of a drip up to a stand holding two nearly empty bags. With a shrug, I reached out and held onto the frame and began pushing it towards the bathroom. On the way, I stopped at the chest of drawers and pulled out a tee. Don’t know who it belonged to, and I didn’t care.The principal thing was the tee was clean, cleaner than me, and that was what mattered. I struggled with the stand but managed to get into the shower. I didn’t care which brother’s room I was in, so I used his shower gel and shampoo and borrowed his razor and shaved my legs and under my arms. Just doing those small things took my remaining strength. Warily, I looked in the cupboard over the sink but could only find one toothbrush.None of the brothers had fatal diseases that I knew about. Vigorously I brushed my teeth for a full five minutes. I couldn’t stop scrubbing. Finally, when my gums began to bleed, I stopped and rinsed. I found a comb and brushed it through my butchered hair. There was no point drying it as it would air-dry quickly. I dragged on the tee and found it a bit awkward as I had to thread the drips through the sleeve.A mirthless chuckle escaped me as the tee dropped to my knees. Cautiously, I left the bathroom after hanging my towel out and throwing the toothbrush in the bin. The room was still empty. The owner hadn’t returned. Unbalanced, I placed my hand against the wall and used my other hand to push the stand towards the door. Damn, I was shattered by the time I reached it, but I hadn’t given up when I got in the car; I would not give up now.I opened the door and began walking across the concrete floor towards the rec room. Muted laughter and chat drifted towards me, but I’d no idea of the time. Music was playing and getting louder as I got closer to the rec room. Carefully leaning on the wall, I stood in the entrance and swallowed back tears.The space looked no different, shabbier and possibly more cluttered, and the brothers were present. They slouched in chairs and sofas and sat at the bar. Apache and Ace, Artemis clinging to Ace’s back with arms and legs wrapped around him, played pool in the corner. Hunter and Blaze were having an aggressive game of air hockey. I checked and saw Lowrider in an armchair with Lindsey curled on his lap, his arms around her. Silvie was opposite them with Chance, the president of Hellfire and two of his brothers, Pyro and Banshee, better known as Shee. Two candidates, Klutz and Gauntlet, were serving Drake, Texas, Axel and Fish at the bar. Mac was flicking through TV channels even though the music was blaring, and Gunner lounged full length on another sofa. Autumn lay across his body. Manny and Slick looked to be playing chess, both deep in concentration.But I didn’t see Ezra, Lex, Marsha or the man who had been avoiding me, Rock. Phoe had her ass in Bear’s lap, the VP from Hellfire. I also spied Big Al and Chatter sitting relaxing, beer in hand, talking between themselves. Hurt, I clung to the wall hidden in shadows and wished I had a camera to take this snapshot, this snapshot of those I thought of as family.Sadly, I lifted my hand to wipe tears from my eyes, and my movement caught Drake’s sharp gaze. Within seconds, Drake strode over and placed an arm around my waist, supporting me. Drake took my weight and pulled me into him. I smelt leather, man and a scent that I only ever linked with Drake, home.Drake chucked me under the chin, so I lifted my head, and he searched my face. Whatever he saw satisfied him, and Drake lifted me as if I weighed nothing. At this point, I probably didn’t, and Drake carried me across the room. Eyes followed, and although they tracked our progress, no one said anything, just carried on with what they were doing.Drake placed me on an armchair in the old lady’s section near Lowrider, who gave me a warm wink. Lindsey dragged out a bag she had near her feet and passed me a ball of wool and a crochet hook. Confused, I stared for a few minutes, tears in my eyes, as I tried to grasp what Lindsey was telling me, and then I began casting on. A few minutes later, Blaze placed a coke near my chair on a rickety table and left me alone.Scared of believing, I kept my head down, concentrating on the wool, not knowing what to make of what was happening. My arrival had been met with tenseness and a vibe I was unwanted. Now I was settled in the midst of Rage and Hellfire, and no one was saying anything. My brain, although no longer foggy and muzzy, was definitely confused.The clubhouse doors opened, and in walked the missing members of Rage, Ezra, Lex, Marsha and Manny, followed by the missing old ladies. Behind them came three further Hellfire members, Tiny, Celt and Diesel. They carried bags, and the smell of Chinese wafted in my direction. They put the bags on the bar, and the candidates began handing out containers.My head remained dipped when suddenly, arms wrapped around me, and I was lifted and curled into muscled solid arms. My ass hit a lap, and those arms remained carefully tight around me. A beard nuzzled into my neck, and my startled eyes met Rock’s soft brown ones. Rock grinned and relaxed, drawing me close against his chest. Gently, Rock kept his arm away from the wounds on my back. Jett placed containers on a table, and reaching out with one hand, Rock snagged one.His other hand hanging over my shoulder snagged my wool, tucked it behind us, and Rock popped off the container lid. Rock grabbed the fork that Jett had put on top of the containers and forked up a mouthful of noodles, which he raised and held to my mouth. I looked at Rock in surprise.“Open up, babe,” Rock rumbled, and I sensed it deep in his chest. Obediently, I opened up and, like a baby bird, he fed me. Disbelievingly, I shook my head after a few bites, and Rock’s eyes narrowed, but he ate the rest. Next, Rock pulled out a container of prawn toast, which I loved, and a container of chicken satay on skewers. With a teasing air, Rock waved one under my nose, and I snatched it and bit into it. Watchful brown eyes gazed at me as I chewed and swallowed.“More?” Rock asked, and I nodded. Eating a second and third piece of prawn toast, I shook my head at the fourth offering. Eyes randomly checked on us, but no one commented. What was happening? Rock ate one-handed, keeping a hand around my waist and keeping me hooked against his chest. Okay, I leaned my head back and decided if this was a bizarre dream brought on by my illness, I was going to enjoy it.“What’s going on?” I whispered.“Shhh,” Rock said back and bit into a prawn toast. He chewed, and I watched his throat as he swallowed and fought the urge to kiss it. Not knowing where I stood, I behaved myself, but this was hard. This might be my dream, but I wouldn't risk embarrassing myself on the off chance I was reading this situation wrong. Rock glanced down and grinned at me as he read my face. “Go ahead, baby, all yours,” Rock whispered, tilting his head and putting his mouth against my ear. Rock dropped a kiss on the shell, and I shivered. His eyes flared, and I shivered again, and he took on a decidedly smug look.I looked around in bewilderment and saw sneaky glances and cheerful grins in our direction. Silvie looked beside herself, and Lindsey was happily grinning. Embarrassed, I tucked my head under Rock’s chin and closed my eyes. Yeah, I was going to accept this strange new reality, even if I only had tonight. Slowly, I allowed the chat to lull me into a light sleep.Startled, I opened my eyes as Rock lifted me in his arms and, pushing my stand, carried me back to the bedroom. He kicked the door open, carried me in, and laid me on the bed. Rock deftly swapped the two empty bags for full ones and hooked them up. And without saying a word, Rock opened the door and shouted through it to Blaze to get two toothbrushes.Still wordless, Rock stripped off his tee in front of my startled eyes, undid his jeans, and sat on the bed. He tugged off his boots and shucked his jeans, and finally, Rock lay on the bed next to me. With a twist, Rock curled me into his arms. By the time Rock wrapped me up tightly, I was drooling; he was ripped. A well-defined six-pack and pecs, hard tight nipples, and sparse hair trailed to a narrow line leading to his boxers. I glanced up, admiring his body.“You wouldn’t talk to me,” I said. Rock offered an uncomfortable nod. “What’s going on? How long was I out of it?”“Honey, you were out for four days. Doc Paul was ready to admit you when your fever broke, and you began stabilising.”“That answers one of my questions,” I said. Rock gave me a half-smile, and I stared at his mouth. Rock elaborated.“Carly, you’re home, you’re mine, and that’s what’s going on.”“Just like that?” I asked, stunned.“Babe, I watched and waited for two years for you to be comfortable in your skin and to come into your own. You strutted your ass across the forecourt, climbed me and kissed me like no bitch has ever kissed me before. Then before I could move on you, Carly, you drove away without a goodbye. Six months babe, six months we didn’t know where you were, no word, no call, no sighting. I got you back, ain’t letting go, and I’m laying claim to you. Waited long enough.”Wow, I blinked in surprise. Well, that answered the other two questions. I thought over Rock’s words, and as I did so, a hand slid up my back and gently pressed me harder into his side. Restless, my hand with the cannula crept up Rock’s muscular chest and stayed there. Under my hand, Rock’s heart beat steady and robust.“Claiming me for how long?” I asked softly.“Carly, I’m thirty-two; you’re twenty, should let you go to someone better. Someone who’ll give you the white picket fence and shit, not gonna. Carly, I see you, which means babe, I see you. Should let you live a little, not gonna, but I know you’re innocent, which means when you give yourself to me, you’re mine, for life. You got one chance, Carly. Tell me now to go, and I’ll walk. Still take your back but will leave you be, you don’t, you’re mine for good. Get me?” Dazed, I stared at him, really looked at him. Rock was a biker, a brother, and had been Rage for years. He was tall, over six foot two; I was five foot five. Rock towered over me and gave me the sensation of being safe, of being cherished. Rock was lean hipped with long muscled legs, broad shoulders, a broad chest, and a tight ass. He was covered in tattoos, but they weren’t off-putting.Rock’s face wasn’t classically handsome, but it was appealing and eye-catching. There was something compelling about Rock, something that drew a person’s eye. His eyes were a soft brown, and I’d seen them darkened in anger before. Rock’s hair was a shade too long and a dark rich brown, his beard the same. He kept it trimmed short, highlighting sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline.Those brown eyes were steady on mine; he didn’t speak, just let me think. Rock had many qualities I admired; he was funny, calm, steady, loyal, and so much more. He also was hot-tempered, quick to anger, blinkered when it came to his brothers and could be cruel. Rock had never been mean to me, but I’d seen him treat other women who got in his space, like shit.“I get it, babe,” Rock whispered, hope fading in his eyes. He bent and kissed my forehead before gathering his body to get off the bed. I gave a mew of discontent and my hand pressed against his chest. Hope flared again, and I curled into Rock and hooked my leg over his. Rock settled and, holding me tight, tucked his big body around me and held me until I slept.◆◆◆ I woke up to a hand stroking my stomach. The welts were faded now, still visible, but definitely faded. My tee had lifted during the night and was halfway up my torso. I blushed as I’d no underwear on, and I discovered Rock staring at the welts. Some of them would scar because they were so deep. Rock shifted on the bed and kissed each welt gently, and tears come to my eyes again. I moved my hand into Rock’s hair, and his head jerked up, and he looked into my eyes.“Carly, I’ll pay,” Rock said bizarrely, and I went stiff.“Pardon?” I asked sharply. Rock frowned.“I’ll pay for them to be removed; give you back your body.” I relaxed, and Rock looked at me, still puzzled.“Oh, I thought you meant….” I broke off blushing, and Rock shot me a grin. He was amused. Damn him, I just wanted to die in embarrassment.“Never paid for pussy before babe, as sweet as yours is, I’m not payin’ for yours either.”“I… yeah,” I whispered, embarrassed. Rock’s hand curved around my hip, and he laid his head on my stomach. I felt and heard a chuckle.“Babe, I’ll pay if you want them removed.”“I was thinking of having them tattooed over,” I said, and Rock glanced up and smiled. “I earned these Rock, protecting the old ladies, they mean something.” Rock scowled and when I flinched, smoothed it away.“That would be something. A couple of Hellfire do ink. Skilled ink. Can talk to them.” “Well, I’d need to think on designs and save money first,” I mumbled.“I’ll pay.”“No Rock, I’ll pay.”“You mine?” I nodded. “Then I’ll pay; I look after my woman. Carly, you’ll have what you need and want. And I’ll get what I need and want from you. But you gotta let me give you what you need and want. Not gonna fight you over it,” he said against my stomach. Rock twisted his head and dropped a kiss on my pubic bone. I stiffened, and then his head turned, and he kissed my stomach again. Rock shifted his weight and rolled me onto my stomach.Rock pulled the tee right up to my shoulders and stared at my naked back. I wriggled in embarrassment and tried to pull a sheet up. His big hand stopped me, and then I felt his lips kissing each welt and scar on my back, moving downwards to my ass and then my thighs.When he had finished kissing every wound, he drew himself up and wrapped his arms around me, enveloping me in his big body. It should have been threatening; it wasn’t. In this man’s arms, pain, hate and despair would never touch me again.",

      "content": "Chapter Two.I woke the following day and, for the first time in months, felt safe. Rock hadn’t asked further questions and just been happy to hold me last night. Yet Rock wasn’t in bed this morning, and I wondered where he’d gone. A quick glance at the clock next to the bed showed six in the morning, which was too early for Rock to be awake. I knew Rock didn’t rise until eight, at least. There was a knock, and Blaze popped his head through. Worried green eyes raked my face, and Blaze winced.“Should’a come to me, Carly,” Blaze said, stepping inside Rock’s room.“No, I couldn’t go to anyone, Blaze, don’t you get it? I was kept captive, my father and brothers….” I broke off, unable to continue. Rock had explained I’d rambled during my delirium but not answered what I’d said. So it was hard to guess who knew what. Blaze’s eyes certainly made me think he knew something.“No, I don’t get it. Understand I ain’t your soulmate, but we’re close, right? That makes me your alternative, and you never once mentioned psychotic fuckin’ brothers or a fuckwad father. Shit Carly, what do you expect me to say? To feel?” Blaze demanded, and I guiltily glanced away from Blaze’s piercing gaze.“Blaze… shit’s not as easy as you think,” I muttered.“Fuck that Carly, shit’s easy, you say Blaze, my family are fucked in the head, and I ran away. Oh, the assholes might come looking for me, which means they’ll hurt me. What’s fuckin’ hard about that?” Blaze demanded, and I recognised guilt in his voice. Damnit, I didn’t want Blaze to feel guilty; he’d been a good and close friend ever since I landed at Made by Rage. When I just needed a shoulder, someone to sit there and be steady, Blaze was there. He called me his little sister, but I didn’t call Blaze a brother. To me, a brother was an insult. Blaze was my best friend.Best friends meant more than brothers, especially blood brothers. Blood could betray you, and that hurt. Blaze had proven himself a friend many times over and was ultra-protective too. My not telling Blaze had hurt him, and I felt guilt rise in my throat.“Do you want to know?” I asked, and Blaze frowned.“Will you need Rock? Man will fuckin’ go nuts if you don’t tell him,” Blaze growled. But the growl was without bite. It was a worried growl, not angry. Trust me, I understood the difference.“Yeah, I can tell you both together,” I murmured and bit my nails. Rock popped up behind Blaze, and I knew they’d set me up. I offered them both a stern glance, but neither showed an ounce of guilt. What was the betting Rock had risen early to grab Blaze? Rock sauntered into the room with jeans undone and hanging low on his waist. Damn him, I bit my nails for another reason now.“Start talking,” Rock demanded and shifted me over to sit behind me on the bed. I gingerly leaned back against him; the wounds hurt, but there was a lot of residual phantom pain.“The story starts with my mother; she wasn’t a redneck, as you’d call her. No, Mom’s parents were middle class, but Mom met and fell hard for my dad. Pa as he insisted on being called. Mom was beautiful but so sad. The life Mom was promised never materialised, and when I turned seven, Mom was worn out and beaten. But there was beauty in her still. I was the last child, meaning I’d four older brothers. Each of one a backward, crude hick,” I said and wrinkled my nose. No lie, I hated my brothers, hated what I came from. It was a typical hick story.“She died?” Rock asked as Blaze slid his back down against the door as he sat and listened. Despite Blaze’s easy-going pose, I guessed he was tense.“When I was eight, I swear they killed her. Mom was nothing better than a drudge, and she gave up. She had a heart attack, but I knew those assholes killed her by wearing Mom out. Mom did everything, washed, cleaned, ironed. She held a part-time job cleaning offices and would come home and start anew in our trailer. Pa had promised her a house, a garden, and when they married, he shoved Mom in a trailer and abused her. Pa was nothing but a stinking drunk,” I spat, hate in my voice. Rock squeezed gently as I trembled in his arms.“Shit, I’d not known how much Mom had protected me from them until she died. Then my life changed overnight. Mom wasn’t even buried before they dragged me from bed at six the following day and started me on her chores. I was eight, for fuck’s sake, a child, my Mom wasn’t even cold, and they forced me to clean house. For the next ten years, I was their slave; I missed so much school, people forgot I existed.My brothers are scum; they didn’t care I was a kid. Elrond is the eldest, followed by Barney and then Otis and Chester last. They brought women home, and I learned about sex long before I should have. Kids shouldn’t see what I’ve seen,” I said, my voice fading as memories threatened to overwhelm me.“Baby, you weren’t touched?” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“Not sexually, no, but Pa and my brothers didn’t hold back on beatings if they thought I needed it. For stupid shit, such as, if I didn’t get a beer quick enough, I got beaten, that type of stuff. Rock, I don’t want to dwell on it, but it was a terrible life. When I was eighteen, I discovered Otis had sold my virginity to a scumbag, and I fled. Ran as hard and fast as I could and landed here. Do you have any idea how heavenly Rage was? How Silvie’s and Lindsey’s kindness threw me? They treated me like a decent human being. I’d never once known that.But at the back of my mind, I’d knew they’d find me again; Otis had sold me and needed me. To be on the constant lookout is wearing, it’s tiring, and I sometimes just wanted to tell you everything and beg for protection,” I whispered.“Why didn’t you, Carly?” Blaze demanded.“Look around, Blaze, look at the trouble that finds Rage; I didn’t want to bring anything else down on the club. And my brothers are assholes who will shoot first and not care if women and children get hurt. That’s how they got me to return. They’ve got friends the same as them, they could rival Rage in numbers, and they’re psychotic and full of drugs, anger, and piss. Yeah, you guys would have won, but the women and children wouldn’t have,” I said sharply. Rock and Blaze had to understand that.“Assholes blackmailed you,” Rock grunted.“Yeah, Otis found me and watched. Then Otis and Barney stalked the old ladies. They threatened Silvie and Lindsey first, then mentioned Phoe and how much they’d enjoy fucking her. A classy lady dragged down and abused would be their idea of a wet dream. I’d no choice but to go with them.”“Always a choice,” Rock grumbled, and I shook my head. There hadn’t been an option to stay.“Not when it was the old ladies or me, I chose the old ladies,” I argued, and Rock grunted. “My brothers thought they’d get my money and stuff and were fuming when they realised I had nothing on me,” I explained.“That’s why you left your bank cards and cash here,” Blaze said, and I nodded.“That was the escape plan if they found me. But I underestimated them. I hadn’t expected them to stalk the old ladies and children. The truth was, it was Pa who wanted me back more than them. The bastard beat the shit out of me when they dragged me home. But my brothers didn’t care. Pa wanted the trailer cleaned, food on the table, my money. Yeah, Otis wanted me back to fulfil the promise to his friend, but the guy was inside doing time, so Hans wasn’t a threat.Whenever I got stronger, Pa or one of them would beat me down again. Because they needed to keep me weak to stop me from running. They chained me by the ankle to the dog’s shed at night, and I slept there. I didn’t see a bath or shower for months, I used to wash in the stream, but I kept planning. Pa was weak, too much booze, and he was dying. His death was just a matter of time. As soon as Pa began choking and dying, I watched. Damn, I wanted that asshole to know I was going to win. I told him I was. Told Pa I was returning here and getting my money and planning a good life.There was so much fuckin’ hatred in Pa’s eyes. Pa wanted to kill me and couldn’t; I sat there and told him everything I planned to do and watched the bastard die. And I didn’t go for help or try to help him. I did nothing but sit there and tell Pa pretty stories of how my life would be, despite him. Maybe you’ll look at me differently, but I won’t take that back. The pleasure I got from watching evil die is unsurpassed,” I whispered, and Blaze shook his head.“Was strong, honey,” Blaze muttered. Rock merely tightened his arms.“Babe, if you’d got that cunt help, I’d have spanked your ass,” Rock muttered, and I gave a weak smile.“As soon as the police had arrived and taken Pa away, I was gone. I’d already stolen the money from his wallet and raided his savings. First, I went north, selling his car on the way and then west to buy a new one. If my brothers followed, they’d think I was heading to Canada as I used to talk about it lots. Then I drove here; I didn’t realise how ill I was, but I kept going with Rage in mind. And yeah, I expected a chilly reception, but I needed to get my card and savings so I could start anew. And then I arrived here, home,” I said, and my hands clenched on Rock’s arms.“Trust me, you’re home,” Blaze said and didn’t even bother to look at Rock for an agreement.“Home,” I said wistfully, and Rock’s arms clenched around me. “My brothers may come looking. Otis still has to provide me to his scumbag friend. But I’ve realised something, they’d never have got close to the old ladies and children. The assholes played on my fears, but I forgot how strong Rage and their women are. Artemis would take them out in the blink of an eye, even if she was nine months pregnant and in labour. Ingrained fear of them allowed them to play me, and I fell for it.Was so stupid to believe they’d get close to Rage. They’d never get into HQ or reach the girls at Made by Rage. Sin always has Reid or Jett with her, and I was so damn idiotic. I let love blind me to the facts, love for the old ladies, and Otis screwed me right over. The marks on my back and legs are where they tried to break me and couldn’t.See, I’d tasted freedom; I understood there was a better life for me. Even if Rage turned against me when I returned, and I wouldn’t have blamed you, I was stronger because I’d known you. Discovering Made by Rage was the single best thing that ever happened to me. Otis and Elrond are uneducated, but they know how to scare people. Stupidly, I forgot that about them, I’ve been here two years and thought myself safe, and I forgot how vindictive they were,” I said. Blaze looked furious, beside himself with anger. I couldn’t see Rock, but I imagined his face was no better.“How did they find you?” Blaze gritted out.“That damned reporter who took a shot of Made by Rage workshop. He took it without me knowing he was doing so, and they saw it in an article. How the magazine ended up in their hands, who the hell knows,” I said.“Where do they live?” Rock asked.“They have a small trailer park hidden from the rangers in the middle of the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee. So easy to lose people there,” I replied.“Huh, I don’t get how an article on Made by Rage ended up in Tennessee,” Blaze murmured.“Neither do I, but it did, and they came for me,” I replied. “My family lived so far off the grid we could have been lost forever. The closest town was Gatlinburg, which was a couple of hours from where we lived,” I explained. After Mom’s death, my brothers and father had fled into the mountains, preferring not to have eyes on them.“What’s the possibility of them coming for you?” Rock grunted.“Fifty-fifty. Otis has spent the money he charged for me. The asshole he sold me to won’t settle for money. Hans will want me, and Otis will need to capture me. But I kept telling stories of how bad guys had tried to defeat you, and you kept beating them down. So that may give them pause for thought. And I also played on the strength of the relationship between Rage, Hawthorne and RCPD. Maybe I shouldn’t have come back, but I needed my cards and money,” I said sadly. The truth was, I may have brought even more trouble down on these wonderful men.Sure, most of the Rage brothers had grim, stern expressions and could be viewed as surly. But they’d go down shooting for anyone they cared about. Rage embodied the meaning of family; they didn’t care if you shared blood. They made family out of loyalty, honour and strength. Rage bled for each other, and if someone hurt, the others made sure they healed. Rage had been a completely foreign idea to me, people pulling together like they did. I’d never heard of such a thing, didn’t believe a concept like Rage existed.Family to me was harsh and cruel, unsupportive and abusive. A family that not only came together but worked together to ensure everyone’s happiness. Alien. Obviously, I’d not had much education, but Rage was above normal family standards from what I saw. At first, I’d been shocked by their actions. Silvie taking me into her home on the first day had knocked me for six. Lowrider, Drake, and Ace coming for me when Jumbo wanted to make me one of his whores. Who did that? No one in my book.Then I watched as Lowrider broke his back to win Lindsey and how Rage and their friends sought to keep her safe. I watched as Gunner treated Silvie so preciously and how torn he was between Autumn and Silvie. Men did not treat women as Rage did. Men slapped, pinched and abused. But not Rage. When one of them lost their temper, I was terrified and waited for fists to fly, but all they did was shout at their woman. Not once did I see a fist clench or raised to slap. And their woman shouted straight back without fear.Rage needed to be respected. While their women got into their faces, the women didn’t cross a certain line. Well, not unless your name was Artemis. No one could control her. Every man with an old lady cherished them, indulged their woman’s whims, took pride in their accomplishments. Again, that was something strange. I wondered why Rage did that, and slowly over time, I realised, because that is what love was. Boosting your other half to make them feel good. And I’d watched as the women did the same in return, making sure the men had silent support, cooking or buying favourite meals, just because. There wasn’t a reason; it was just because.And over time, I became one of the old ladies loosely; I’d taken the first step when I stabbed Lindsey’s ex-husband. I took the second step when I defended Silvie. But then I allowed my brothers to take that away, steal my identity and make me a drudge again. Stupidly, I’d caved and forgot the lessons Rage had taught, and although my body may be bruised and battered, my mind wasn’t. Actual strength came from within, the ability to withstand anything and walk-through fire.A movement made me glance up, and I stared as Drake lounged in the doorway. Drake’s face was impassive, but his eyes, as usual, were full of fire and emotion. Drake could control his face, but never his eyes. Brown eyes raked me from head to toe and then glanced at the silent man behind me and the second now sitting on my bed. Drake seemed to be seeking something, and when he found it, his eyes flared again.“About time you realised,” Drake muttered. Realised? “Carly, you’re stronger than you thought, stronger with us, and stronger with Rock behind you.”“Yes, I was stupid,” I said.“Yeah, tremendously.” Typical Drake, not mincing his words. “And see what stupidity brought. Woman, you should have come straight to us and let us protect you. As of now, Carly girl, you see hide or hair of those assholes, you shout and shout fucking loudly.” I frowned, puzzled; I thought the saying was hide nor hair, but Drake’s eyes dared me to challenge him.“Okay,” I replied.“Rock mentioned you might want your back tattooed over. Last I saw, it was a fuckin’ mess. Consequences Carly. What you did was damn brave, sacrificing yourself for the old ladies, but maybe now you realise that the sacrifice was unnecessary and fuckin’ stupid. Put yourself through hell for no reason. Whatever. Gotta let your wounds heal before we even look at tattooing. Scars may be too thick, and you might need surgery to remove the worst, and then we tattoo over it. Don’t jump before I say and don’t go running to another shop. We got people who do our tats right here in Rage, and Hellfire has a couple of talented artists,” Drake ordered.“Okay,” I said because there was no arguing with Drake when he laid the law down. Shit just wasn’t worth it.“Make sure Carly obeys,” Drake told Rock, who grunted with amusement. Blaze grinned as my head snapped up at the word obey. Irately, I pursed my lips, and Drake nodded in approval.“There she is, the fighter. We’re gonna keep prodding at you until you understand she’s there. We seen you strong Carly, we seen you quiet and reflective, need to see the fighter now.”“But I don’t like confrontations,” I said, and the three men threw their heads back in laughter.“Bullshit. What you call stabbing a man? What you call taking Silvie’s side. Fuck me, the girl don’t like confrontations,” Drake chuckled.“Might not like them, but you can handle them,” Blaze agreed, nodding. I wanted to bop him on the head, but Blaze would only bop me back. Blaze strongly believed in equal rights.“We got a fuckin’ party going on I don’t know about? Because if not, my woman’s screwing because she wants her girl in the workshop,” Lowrider said, appearing behind Drake. Lowrider’s mock glower warmed me; it was an expression I was very familiar with. Lowrider often used it when he was arguing with Lindsey, and she walked straight across his argument.“Rider,” Axel bellowed and clapped Lowrider on the back, and Lowrider stumbled forward a few steps.“Axel, for fuck’s sake,” Lowrider groused.“There she is. About time you got your fuckin’ head on straight. Now get out of bed; Lindsey’s screwing,” Axel boomed.“Just told Carly that,” Lowrider chuffed.“Well, Lindsey’s gonna have to wait. Carly needs shit,” Rock replied, and I glanced up.“I do?” I asked.“Where’s your clothes and shit?” Rock asked pointedly.“Oh,” I said. Rock was right; I needed stuff. My brothers had made me pack everything, and they’d sold most of it.“Thought so,” Rock grunted. Drake and Rock exchanged glances over my head.“I’ll pull Jett in to cover your shift at the bar, take Carly shopping,” Drake said. I shook my head.“Drake, I can wait for stuff,” I said, and Drake frowned, and I hushed.“The fuck you can, do as you’re told,” Drake said, and I nodded. If Drake told me to go shopping, then shopping it was.“Don’t think the challenger a good idea for Carly; I need a pickup,” Rock said, and Lowrider dragged a set of keys from his pocket. Deftly he threw them at Rock, who let go of me and caught them.“Take tonight too,” Drake said, and Rock nodded. Rock’s beard tickled my neck as he sank his head back into me. I raised a hand to cup his face, and Rock dropped a kiss on my palm.“Rider, go back to Lindsey before she dropkicks you for leaving her with the kids while she’s trying to feed the baby and work,” Drake ordered. Shit, I’d missed the births of Sin and Jett’s baby, Drake and Phoe’s, and Lindsey had also had hers. Deep guilt struck me, but I was also euphoric that they’d given birth safely and without stress.“The babies?” I asked, and Drake’s mouth twitched.“Sin and Jett have a little girl, Brooke. Lindsey gave birth to a boy, Elijah, and Phoe and I had a little girl, Peyton,” Drake said, his mouth softening.“So, who’s knocked up?” I asked bluntly, and Drake roared with laughter. Rock’s body shook behind me, and Blaze broke into a smile.“Marsha is again. Seems now they’ve dropped one set they’ve done it again,” Rock murmured.“Twins again?” I gasped.“Fuck no, Marsha will kill Fish. Just one. Gunner’s knocked Autumn up, and she’s cursing; that’s twins again. Silvie is due in the next couple of weeks. Artemis is knocked up again, and so is Sin,” Drake rattled their names off, and my eyes grew wide.“What is it with you brothers to keep knocking up your women?” I gasped.“Keeps us busy, makes baby boys for brothers and little girls for old ladies,” Drake grinned, and I chuckled.“Incest!” I spouted, and Drake looked horrified.“Not at all!” Blaze said, laughing. “Just creating the next generation of Rage.” My jaw dropped open, and I stared at Blaze in shock.“You claimed an old lady and knocked her up?” I gasped, and Rock began shaking harder at the expression that crossed Blaze’s face.“Fuck no,” Blaze denied, and Drake joined in, laughing. “Don’t know why you’re laughing after what Phoe pulled,” Blaze sniped, and Drake stopped laughing, and his expression darkened.“Should I ask?” I whispered, turning my head to Rock’s throat.“Phoe got sterilised, and Drake threw a shit fit to end all fits,” Rock murmured back.“Oh crap,” I whispered, and Rock squeezed me.“Drake wanted two more to make it an even twenty,” Rock replied.“Oh, they can adopt two more, surely?” I exclaimed, and Drake’s gaze shot to my face, and I bit my lip. Slowly, a wicked smile crossed Drake’s face, and I guessed I’d put my foot straight in it. Oops, so much for sister bonds. Phoe would kill me.“Sure can, sweetness, and on that note….” Drake strode away.“Damn, you’re in for it now. Phoe has threatened to cut the balls off a brother and cut an old lady if anyone suggested that to Drake,” Blaze said and shook his head. “Nice knowing ya.” Blaze strode from the room and left me with a chuckling Rock.“You’ll protect me?” I asked, teasing and Rock glanced at me.“Ain’t got kids, Carly, I need my balls to give you kids. Phoe’s sneaky; you’re on your own!” My mouth opened and closed, and I narrowed my eyes.“Kids?” I muttered, and Rock relaxed back against the pillows.“Give you a few months before springing them on ya, baby,” Rock said, supremely confident in his abilities to knock me up.“A few years is reasonable,” I quipped.“Don’t make me do a Jett,” Rock whispered and kissed the sensitive part of my throat. I blanched; the entire clubhouse knew what to do a Jett meant. Jett had chased Sin around, throwing away her birth control pills until she’d got pregnant. And it looks like Jett had succeeded again. I slapped Rock’s meaty thigh lightly.“Don’t make me do a Phoe; you know I’m capable of it,” I said, referring to cutting his balls off. Rock stiffened and then relaxed, laughing.“We’ll revisit this in a few months,” Rock teased. Yeah, sure we would.“I better get showered if we’re going out, I’ll need my bank card,” I said, but Rock hauled me back against him.“Carly, you understand what’s happening, babe? I’m claimin’ you?” Rock asked.“Yes,” I said.“That means, babe, I get to cherish and look after you. Now I can see that’s going to be a battle because it’s not something you’re used to. But you’ve seen how Rage treats their women; you’re not a stranger to seeing it. But you’re a stranger for it being aimed at you. Let me take care of you, Carly, and don’t fight me on this,” Rock asked, and I thought that over. Rock was right. No one had ever taken care of me since Mom died. I was used to being fiercely independent and surviving. Rock was offering more than survival; he was offering to protect and care for me.“Okay, I won’t fight you for now. But there’s stuff you need to understand, Rock. Like, I want to get an education; I can’t ever imagine leaving Made by Rage, but I want an education. Second, there’s no point buying lots of clothes today, you see how skinny I am? Pointless buying lots when I’m sure to regain the weight I lost. And I need a haircut please, Barney cut my hair with a pair of shears, and it’s a mess,” I said, pursing my lips. My long hair was gone. Barney had done a right number on my hair, and I hated it. Rock soothed me by brushing his hand over my throat.“Whatever you want, but Doc Paul said the best way for you to gain weight is to eat lots of small meals. Doc doesn’t think your stomach will cope with three enormous meals a day. Which means get showered and your ass dressed, and I can take you for breakfast at the Reading Nook,” Rock said and gave me a slight push. I laughed as Rock patted his stomach. Rock was always eating at the Reading Nook; the man loved Penny’s food and could eat six pastries in one sitting. Damn good job Rock worked construction with Apache.The two men owned a construction company, BlackRock, a play on Apache’s surname Blackelk and Rock’s name. The company was phenomenally successful, and I knew they employed many people. They had an office downtown but were rarely in it, preferring to be outside working with their hands. I honestly didn’t know how they managed, as they had to do a shift in the shop, one in the bar and a patrol each week.I showered quickly, wondering how Rock kept so many things balanced and realised many of the brothers had other jobs. Fish ran the garage as the manager, Gunner, rented houses and worked as a carpenter in the other part of Made by Rage. Slick ran a rental company leasing over twenty properties, Manny was the second carpenter in Made by Rage, and he and Gunner produced some stunning pieces. Ezra ran a landscaping company with Slate working with him and Mac co-ran the bar with someone from Hellfire. Lex managed the Rage Shop while Blaze and Hunter had just opened a gym when I left.Everyone else, from Drake to Lowrider, etcetera, worked in the garage. It didn’t matter whether they designed bikes (Jett, Texas, Lowrider and Calamity) or whether they painted and fixed them (Ace, Axel, Drake, Savage and Gauntlet). Although Gauntlet had recently taken over the part store from Blaze when Blaze opened the gym. The brothers had supported the new enterprise, and most visited the gym several times a week; having free membership meant they used it. And on top of the businesses Rage ran, as I said, they had a shift to do in the bar, Rage Shop and a patrol.Blaze had once taken me on a walk around at the gym, and I’d been amazed. It was set over two stories, the bottom being a sauna, hot tub and a large swimming pool with changing rooms. The upstairs held two rooms for classes and a vast area dedicated to working out. They had every piece of equipment one could think of having. That put a thought into my head.“Do you think Blaze will let me use the swimming pool if I get there early?” I asked, coming out of the tiny bathroom wrapped in a towel. Rock remained lying on the bed, eyes lazily taking me in with more than a hint of interest, and I blushed. I wasn’t used to Rock being so blatant in his perusal of me.“Yeah, Blaze won’t mind,” Rock said, sitting. “Come here.” I hesitated, unsure and taking courage; I walked across and stood in front of him. Rock’s hands gently reached out, and he dragged me into his lap. His hands cupped my face, and his mouth touched mine gently. It was searching, waiting for approval, and my hands slipped into his thick hair. Rock deepened the kiss a little, his lips gently on mine and his teeth nibbling my bottom lip. A finger traced the slender contour of my throat, and I gasped, and Rock took advantage, sliding inside my mouth. I’d kissed Rock before, and when I climbed him like a monkey, our kiss had turned wild.This was a different kiss. I sensed Rock didn’t want to hurt me but wanted me to know he desired me. His tongue gently danced with mine, and I tasted mint and coffee mixed together. Rock broke the kiss, and I gazed at him, speechless. Was that all I was getting? Rock chuckled at my expression.“Pout a little harder,” Rock said, so I did, and he leant forward and nibbled my lip again. “Ah baby, I love that bottom lip of yours.”“But you stopped kissing it quick enough,” I said sulkily, and Rock smiled.“Don’t have to rush shit; certain things need to be savoured,” Rock said. Really? He was going there?“Seriously,” I gasped. “I’ve watched you drag skanks off for a quickie lots of times, now you’re denying me?” Was Rock not attracted to me then? This made little sense, but I’d little experience with men and dating.“Sweetness, you ain’t no skank, and you’re my woman. You don’t get a wham-bam, and thank you, ma’am. Carly, you get the full works, the complete effort I’m planning to put in to make you mine. By the time I’ve finished, you won’t want anyone else but me by your side.”“Wham bam and thank you, ma’am, sounds pretty good right now,” I whispered mulishly, and Rock broke into laughter.“That sure does, but as my old lady and a damn virgin Carly, you deserve better. And that don’t mean losing your virginity in a fuckin’ clubhouse back room,” Rock said and dropped a kiss on my forehead. Damn, I just got told, and there was no budging Rock when he made a decision. Nuts! Rock hauled me gently to my feet, well aware of his own strength, and marched me from his room.“Rock, I’m not dressed!” I yelped, grabbing my towel tightly as Calamity stopped in the hallway and stared at me wide-eyed. Rock grimaced and let go, and I fled back into his room.“Not a word,” Rock warned Calamity, who grinned.“Nope, not one,” Calamity said and then fled down the hallway, yelling for Drake. Rock rolled his eyes and promised revenge on the Rage prospect.I found some clean leggings, a tee one of the old ladies must have bought, and a sports bra with underwear. I dragged them on before Rock got some other bright idea and slipped my feet into my battered and torn tennis shoes. Just once I glanced at the mirror and winced, I looked like a street waif, unfed and unkempt. My hair was the overall concern; it was such a mess. Barney had hacked at it out of spite. Searching through Rock’s drawers, I found a clean bandana and wrapped it around my head. That hid most of the ugliness, but not all. But I decided it was possible to venture out in public.Rock was waiting for me in the rec room. Or rather, he was chasing Calamity around the pool table with Slick and Ezra, looking on laughing. The prospect laughed cheekily and kept throwing quips at Rock, who threw some threats of his own back. I lifted an eyebrow and wondered what the problem was. Calamity spied me and focused Rock’s attention on me.“You and I ain’t done prospect,” Rock warned as he left the laughing prospect and headed towards me. “Just remember, you got training with me tonight.” Calamity groaned loudly as Slick began laughing instead.“Prospect, you don’t learn,” Slick shouted as Calamity hung his head. Rock reached for my arm and dragged me into his side.“Have fun,” Marsha called from somewhere, and I twisted my head around, trying to find her. A hand rose from behind the bar, and I called goodbye.“Get off your knee’s woman, Fish is in the office,” Rock called and hurried me out as Marsha’s head popped over the bar and glared. Rock rushed me out the door, laughing, and I shook my head. Marsha would get him back later; I had no doubt. This teasing was a new side to Rock, one I enjoyed.“First, let’s get something done with your hair. Because if I know you, and I know you, Carly, you won’t go shopping while it’s looking like that,” Rock grunted. I bit the inside of my cheek; I couldn’t imagine Rock on the inside of a hairdressers. But fuck, not only did Rock walk me to one around the corner to Rage, but he also entered the shop and waited while the hairdresser made a miracle out of my hair. The owner had served us straight away seeing Rock’s cut. Many of the hairdressers and customers kept glancing over at Rock as he hovered by the door, eyes firmly on me and what was happening to me.It was clear. If I got upset, Rock was ready to pounce and resolve any issue that upset me. Sadly, the hairdresser tutted as she ran her hands through my shorn locks and then showed me a few styles. I picked a cute bob and, feeling daring, chose a blue, lilac and pink streak to go through my hair at the front. Rock lifted his eyebrows but nodded an agreement.“Whatever my woman wants,” he drawled, and I swear every female, under sixty and over, just melted their panties. A couple of smiling looks were aimed in my direction, but others held the expressions of, ‘what the fuck is he doing with her?’ I shrugged them away, mainly because what the hell was Rock doing with me? There was no denying the mess I looked. I was terribly underweight to the point of looking anorexic, and my hair… well, that was self-evident.The hairdresser, older than me, squeezed my shoulder in reassurance, and I smiled. She couldn’t help what the customers were saying or thinking, and there was no point in making a scene to deny the truth. I was a mess at the moment, and Rock was smoking hot. The hairdresser grinned as she caught my lustful glance at Rock and bent down.“You know, I’ve been here thirty years; I know all the bad and good that hit Rage MC. And it’s wonderful to see that man over there looking happy,” the hairdresser whispered.Surprised, I glanced at Rock and saw he did look happy, content even. As if Rock’s plan for life was coming to fruition, and he could settle back and reap the glory of it. The harshness on Rock’s face had disappeared, and the lines around his eyes weren’t as pronounced, and it hit me hard. I’d given Rock the contentment and happiness on his face. By agreeing to be his woman, Rock needed nothing else from me, bar my word. Rock had claimed his woman, and she’d claimed him back, and in the world of Rage, once the claiming was done, everything else could happen in time.Which is why Rock wasn’t in a hurry to get me into bed; I guessed he meant to build up to it. Court me, I suppose, and in doing so, Rock would indeed glue us together. Like Lowrider had waited for Lindsey, Rock was prepared to wait for me because I’d given him my word I’d be his, and that was all Rock needed. The enlightenment must have shown on my face because the hairdresser began nodding, and Rock’s gaze was fixed firmly on me. Shyly, I smiled at Rock, and he replied with his own shit-eating grin.",

      "content": "Chapter Two.I woke the following day and, for the first time in months, felt safe. Rock hadn’t asked further questions and just been happy to hold me last night. Yet Rock wasn’t in bed this morning, and I wondered where he’d gone. A quick glance at the clock next to the bed showed six in the morning, which was too early for Rock to be awake. I knew Rock didn’t rise until eight, at least. There was a knock, and Blaze popped his head through. Worried green eyes raked my face, and Blaze winced.“Should’a come to me, Carly,” Blaze said, stepping inside Rock’s room.“No, I couldn’t go to anyone, Blaze, don’t you get it? I was kept captive, my father and brothers….” I broke off, unable to continue. Rock had explained I’d rambled during my delirium but not answered what I’d said. So it was hard to guess who knew what. Blaze’s eyes certainly made me think he knew something.“No, I don’t get it. Understand I ain’t your soulmate, but we’re close, right? That makes me your alternative, and you never once mentioned psychotic fuckin’ brothers or a fuckwad father. Shit Carly, what do you expect me to say? To feel?” Blaze demanded, and I guiltily glanced away from Blaze’s piercing gaze.“Blaze… shit’s not as easy as you think,” I muttered.“Fuck that Carly, shit’s easy, you say Blaze, my family are fucked in the head, and I ran away. Oh, the assholes might come looking for me, which means they’ll hurt me. What’s fuckin’ hard about that?” Blaze demanded, and I recognised guilt in his voice. Damnit, I didn’t want Blaze to feel guilty; he’d been a good and close friend ever since I landed at Made by Rage. When I just needed a shoulder, someone to sit there and be steady, Blaze was there. He called me his little sister, but I didn’t call Blaze a brother. To me, a brother was an insult. Blaze was my best friend.Best friends meant more than brothers, especially blood brothers. Blood could betray you, and that hurt. Blaze had proven himself a friend many times over and was ultra-protective too. My not telling Blaze had hurt him, and I felt guilt rise in my throat.“Do you want to know?” I asked, and Blaze frowned.“Will you need Rock? Man will fuckin’ go nuts if you don’t tell him,” Blaze growled. But the growl was without bite. It was a worried growl, not angry. Trust me, I understood the difference.“Yeah, I can tell you both together,” I murmured and bit my nails. Rock popped up behind Blaze, and I knew they’d set me up. I offered them both a stern glance, but neither showed an ounce of guilt. What was the betting Rock had risen early to grab Blaze? Rock sauntered into the room with jeans undone and hanging low on his waist. Damn him, I bit my nails for another reason now.“Start talking,” Rock demanded and shifted me over to sit behind me on the bed. I gingerly leaned back against him; the wounds hurt, but there was a lot of residual phantom pain.“The story starts with my mother; she wasn’t a redneck, as you’d call her. No, Mom’s parents were middle class, but Mom met and fell hard for my dad. Pa as he insisted on being called. Mom was beautiful but so sad. The life Mom was promised never materialised, and when I turned seven, Mom was worn out and beaten. But there was beauty in her still. I was the last child, meaning I’d four older brothers. Each of one a backward, crude hick,” I said and wrinkled my nose. No lie, I hated my brothers, hated what I came from. It was a typical hick story.“She died?” Rock asked as Blaze slid his back down against the door as he sat and listened. Despite Blaze’s easy-going pose, I guessed he was tense.“When I was eight, I swear they killed her. Mom was nothing better than a drudge, and she gave up. She had a heart attack, but I knew those assholes killed her by wearing Mom out. Mom did everything, washed, cleaned, ironed. She held a part-time job cleaning offices and would come home and start anew in our trailer. Pa had promised her a house, a garden, and when they married, he shoved Mom in a trailer and abused her. Pa was nothing but a stinking drunk,” I spat, hate in my voice. Rock squeezed gently as I trembled in his arms.“Shit, I’d not known how much Mom had protected me from them until she died. Then my life changed overnight. Mom wasn’t even buried before they dragged me from bed at six the following day and started me on her chores. I was eight, for fuck’s sake, a child, my Mom wasn’t even cold, and they forced me to clean house. For the next ten years, I was their slave; I missed so much school, people forgot I existed.My brothers are scum; they didn’t care I was a kid. Elrond is the eldest, followed by Barney and then Otis and Chester last. They brought women home, and I learned about sex long before I should have. Kids shouldn’t see what I’ve seen,” I said, my voice fading as memories threatened to overwhelm me.“Baby, you weren’t touched?” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“Not sexually, no, but Pa and my brothers didn’t hold back on beatings if they thought I needed it. For stupid shit, such as, if I didn’t get a beer quick enough, I got beaten, that type of stuff. Rock, I don’t want to dwell on it, but it was a terrible life. When I was eighteen, I discovered Otis had sold my virginity to a scumbag, and I fled. Ran as hard and fast as I could and landed here. Do you have any idea how heavenly Rage was? How Silvie’s and Lindsey’s kindness threw me? They treated me like a decent human being. I’d never once known that.But at the back of my mind, I’d knew they’d find me again; Otis had sold me and needed me. To be on the constant lookout is wearing, it’s tiring, and I sometimes just wanted to tell you everything and beg for protection,” I whispered.“Why didn’t you, Carly?” Blaze demanded.“Look around, Blaze, look at the trouble that finds Rage; I didn’t want to bring anything else down on the club. And my brothers are assholes who will shoot first and not care if women and children get hurt. That’s how they got me to return. They’ve got friends the same as them, they could rival Rage in numbers, and they’re psychotic and full of drugs, anger, and piss. Yeah, you guys would have won, but the women and children wouldn’t have,” I said sharply. Rock and Blaze had to understand that.“Assholes blackmailed you,” Rock grunted.“Yeah, Otis found me and watched. Then Otis and Barney stalked the old ladies. They threatened Silvie and Lindsey first, then mentioned Phoe and how much they’d enjoy fucking her. A classy lady dragged down and abused would be their idea of a wet dream. I’d no choice but to go with them.”“Always a choice,” Rock grumbled, and I shook my head. There hadn’t been an option to stay.“Not when it was the old ladies or me, I chose the old ladies,” I argued, and Rock grunted. “My brothers thought they’d get my money and stuff and were fuming when they realised I had nothing on me,” I explained.“That’s why you left your bank cards and cash here,” Blaze said, and I nodded.“That was the escape plan if they found me. But I underestimated them. I hadn’t expected them to stalk the old ladies and children. The truth was, it was Pa who wanted me back more than them. The bastard beat the shit out of me when they dragged me home. But my brothers didn’t care. Pa wanted the trailer cleaned, food on the table, my money. Yeah, Otis wanted me back to fulfil the promise to his friend, but the guy was inside doing time, so Hans wasn’t a threat.Whenever I got stronger, Pa or one of them would beat me down again. Because they needed to keep me weak to stop me from running. They chained me by the ankle to the dog’s shed at night, and I slept there. I didn’t see a bath or shower for months, I used to wash in the stream, but I kept planning. Pa was weak, too much booze, and he was dying. His death was just a matter of time. As soon as Pa began choking and dying, I watched. Damn, I wanted that asshole to know I was going to win. I told him I was. Told Pa I was returning here and getting my money and planning a good life.There was so much fuckin’ hatred in Pa’s eyes. Pa wanted to kill me and couldn’t; I sat there and told him everything I planned to do and watched the bastard die. And I didn’t go for help or try to help him. I did nothing but sit there and tell Pa pretty stories of how my life would be, despite him. Maybe you’ll look at me differently, but I won’t take that back. The pleasure I got from watching evil die is unsurpassed,” I whispered, and Blaze shook his head.“Was strong, honey,” Blaze muttered. Rock merely tightened his arms.“Babe, if you’d got that cunt help, I’d have spanked your ass,” Rock muttered, and I gave a weak smile.“As soon as the police had arrived and taken Pa away, I was gone. I’d already stolen the money from his wallet and raided his savings. First, I went north, selling his car on the way and then west to buy a new one. If my brothers followed, they’d think I was heading to Canada as I used to talk about it lots. Then I drove here; I didn’t realise how ill I was, but I kept going with Rage in mind. And yeah, I expected a chilly reception, but I needed to get my card and savings so I could start anew. And then I arrived here, home,” I said, and my hands clenched on Rock’s arms.“Trust me, you’re home,” Blaze said and didn’t even bother to look at Rock for an agreement.“Home,” I said wistfully, and Rock’s arms clenched around me. “My brothers may come looking. Otis still has to provide me to his scumbag friend. But I’ve realised something, they’d never have got close to the old ladies and children. The assholes played on my fears, but I forgot how strong Rage and their women are. Artemis would take them out in the blink of an eye, even if she was nine months pregnant and in labour. Ingrained fear of them allowed them to play me, and I fell for it.Was so stupid to believe they’d get close to Rage. They’d never get into HQ or reach the girls at Made by Rage. Sin always has Reid or Jett with her, and I was so damn idiotic. I let love blind me to the facts, love for the old ladies, and Otis screwed me right over. The marks on my back and legs are where they tried to break me and couldn’t.See, I’d tasted freedom; I understood there was a better life for me. Even if Rage turned against me when I returned, and I wouldn’t have blamed you, I was stronger because I’d known you. Discovering Made by Rage was the single best thing that ever happened to me. Otis and Elrond are uneducated, but they know how to scare people. Stupidly, I forgot that about them, I’ve been here two years and thought myself safe, and I forgot how vindictive they were,” I said. Blaze looked furious, beside himself with anger. I couldn’t see Rock, but I imagined his face was no better.“How did they find you?” Blaze gritted out.“That damned reporter who took a shot of Made by Rage workshop. He took it without me knowing he was doing so, and they saw it in an article. How the magazine ended up in their hands, who the hell knows,” I said.“Where do they live?” Rock asked.“They have a small trailer park hidden from the rangers in the middle of the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee. So easy to lose people there,” I replied.“Huh, I don’t get how an article on Made by Rage ended up in Tennessee,” Blaze murmured.“Neither do I, but it did, and they came for me,” I replied. “My family lived so far off the grid we could have been lost forever. The closest town was Gatlinburg, which was a couple of hours from where we lived,” I explained. After Mom’s death, my brothers and father had fled into the mountains, preferring not to have eyes on them.“What’s the possibility of them coming for you?” Rock grunted.“Fifty-fifty. Otis has spent the money he charged for me. The asshole he sold me to won’t settle for money. Hans will want me, and Otis will need to capture me. But I kept telling stories of how bad guys had tried to defeat you, and you kept beating them down. So that may give them pause for thought. And I also played on the strength of the relationship between Rage, Hawthorne and RCPD. Maybe I shouldn’t have come back, but I needed my cards and money,” I said sadly. The truth was, I may have brought even more trouble down on these wonderful men.Sure, most of the Rage brothers had grim, stern expressions and could be viewed as surly. But they’d go down shooting for anyone they cared about. Rage embodied the meaning of family; they didn’t care if you shared blood. They made family out of loyalty, honour and strength. Rage bled for each other, and if someone hurt, the others made sure they healed. Rage had been a completely foreign idea to me, people pulling together like they did. I’d never heard of such a thing, didn’t believe a concept like Rage existed.Family to me was harsh and cruel, unsupportive and abusive. A family that not only came together but worked together to ensure everyone’s happiness. Alien. Obviously, I’d not had much education, but Rage was above normal family standards from what I saw. At first, I’d been shocked by their actions. Silvie taking me into her home on the first day had knocked me for six. Lowrider, Drake, and Ace coming for me when Jumbo wanted to make me one of his whores. Who did that? No one in my book.Then I watched as Lowrider broke his back to win Lindsey and how Rage and their friends sought to keep her safe. I watched as Gunner treated Silvie so preciously and how torn he was between Autumn and Silvie. Men did not treat women as Rage did. Men slapped, pinched and abused. But not Rage. When one of them lost their temper, I was terrified and waited for fists to fly, but all they did was shout at their woman. Not once did I see a fist clench or raised to slap. And their woman shouted straight back without fear.Rage needed to be respected. While their women got into their faces, the women didn’t cross a certain line. Well, not unless your name was Artemis. No one could control her. Every man with an old lady cherished them, indulged their woman’s whims, took pride in their accomplishments. Again, that was something strange. I wondered why Rage did that, and slowly over time, I realised, because that is what love was. Boosting your other half to make them feel good. And I’d watched as the women did the same in return, making sure the men had silent support, cooking or buying favourite meals, just because. There wasn’t a reason; it was just because.And over time, I became one of the old ladies loosely; I’d taken the first step when I stabbed Lindsey’s ex-husband. I took the second step when I defended Silvie. But then I allowed my brothers to take that away, steal my identity and make me a drudge again. Stupidly, I’d caved and forgot the lessons Rage had taught, and although my body may be bruised and battered, my mind wasn’t. Actual strength came from within, the ability to withstand anything and walk-through fire.A movement made me glance up, and I stared as Drake lounged in the doorway. Drake’s face was impassive, but his eyes, as usual, were full of fire and emotion. Drake could control his face, but never his eyes. Brown eyes raked me from head to toe and then glanced at the silent man behind me and the second now sitting on my bed. Drake seemed to be seeking something, and when he found it, his eyes flared again.“About time you realised,” Drake muttered. Realised? “Carly, you’re stronger than you thought, stronger with us, and stronger with Rock behind you.”“Yes, I was stupid,” I said.“Yeah, tremendously.” Typical Drake, not mincing his words. “And see what stupidity brought. Woman, you should have come straight to us and let us protect you. As of now, Carly girl, you see hide or hair of those assholes, you shout and shout fucking loudly.” I frowned, puzzled; I thought the saying was hide nor hair, but Drake’s eyes dared me to challenge him.“Okay,” I replied.“Rock mentioned you might want your back tattooed over. Last I saw, it was a fuckin’ mess. Consequences Carly. What you did was damn brave, sacrificing yourself for the old ladies, but maybe now you realise that the sacrifice was unnecessary and fuckin’ stupid. Put yourself through hell for no reason. Whatever. Gotta let your wounds heal before we even look at tattooing. Scars may be too thick, and you might need surgery to remove the worst, and then we tattoo over it. Don’t jump before I say and don’t go running to another shop. We got people who do our tats right here in Rage, and Hellfire has a couple of talented artists,” Drake ordered.“Okay,” I said because there was no arguing with Drake when he laid the law down. Shit just wasn’t worth it.“Make sure Carly obeys,” Drake told Rock, who grunted with amusement. Blaze grinned as my head snapped up at the word obey. Irately, I pursed my lips, and Drake nodded in approval.“There she is, the fighter. We’re gonna keep prodding at you until you understand she’s there. We seen you strong Carly, we seen you quiet and reflective, need to see the fighter now.”“But I don’t like confrontations,” I said, and the three men threw their heads back in laughter.“Bullshit. What you call stabbing a man? What you call taking Silvie’s side. Fuck me, the girl don’t like confrontations,” Drake chuckled.“Might not like them, but you can handle them,” Blaze agreed, nodding. I wanted to bop him on the head, but Blaze would only bop me back. Blaze strongly believed in equal rights.“We got a fuckin’ party going on I don’t know about? Because if not, my woman’s screwing because she wants her girl in the workshop,” Lowrider said, appearing behind Drake. Lowrider’s mock glower warmed me; it was an expression I was very familiar with. Lowrider often used it when he was arguing with Lindsey, and she walked straight across his argument.“Rider,” Axel bellowed and clapped Lowrider on the back, and Lowrider stumbled forward a few steps.“Axel, for fuck’s sake,” Lowrider groused.“There she is. About time you got your fuckin’ head on straight. Now get out of bed; Lindsey’s screwing,” Axel boomed.“Just told Carly that,” Lowrider chuffed.“Well, Lindsey’s gonna have to wait. Carly needs shit,” Rock replied, and I glanced up.“I do?” I asked.“Where’s your clothes and shit?” Rock asked pointedly.“Oh,” I said. Rock was right; I needed stuff. My brothers had made me pack everything, and they’d sold most of it.“Thought so,” Rock grunted. Drake and Rock exchanged glances over my head.“I’ll pull Jett in to cover your shift at the bar, take Carly shopping,” Drake said. I shook my head.“Drake, I can wait for stuff,” I said, and Drake frowned, and I hushed.“The fuck you can, do as you’re told,” Drake said, and I nodded. If Drake told me to go shopping, then shopping it was.“Don’t think the challenger a good idea for Carly; I need a pickup,” Rock said, and Lowrider dragged a set of keys from his pocket. Deftly he threw them at Rock, who let go of me and caught them.“Take tonight too,” Drake said, and Rock nodded. Rock’s beard tickled my neck as he sank his head back into me. I raised a hand to cup his face, and Rock dropped a kiss on my palm.“Rider, go back to Lindsey before she dropkicks you for leaving her with the kids while she’s trying to feed the baby and work,” Drake ordered. Shit, I’d missed the births of Sin and Jett’s baby, Drake and Phoe’s, and Lindsey had also had hers. Deep guilt struck me, but I was also euphoric that they’d given birth safely and without stress.“The babies?” I asked, and Drake’s mouth twitched.“Sin and Jett have a little girl, Brooke. Lindsey gave birth to a boy, Elijah, and Phoe and I had a little girl, Peyton,” Drake said, his mouth softening.“So, who’s knocked up?” I asked bluntly, and Drake roared with laughter. Rock’s body shook behind me, and Blaze broke into a smile.“Marsha is again. Seems now they’ve dropped one set they’ve done it again,” Rock murmured.“Twins again?” I gasped.“Fuck no, Marsha will kill Fish. Just one. Gunner’s knocked Autumn up, and she’s cursing; that’s twins again. Silvie is due in the next couple of weeks. Artemis is knocked up again, and so is Sin,” Drake rattled their names off, and my eyes grew wide.“What is it with you brothers to keep knocking up your women?” I gasped.“Keeps us busy, makes baby boys for brothers and little girls for old ladies,” Drake grinned, and I chuckled.“Incest!” I spouted, and Drake looked horrified.“Not at all!” Blaze said, laughing. “Just creating the next generation of Rage.” My jaw dropped open, and I stared at Blaze in shock.“You claimed an old lady and knocked her up?” I gasped, and Rock began shaking harder at the expression that crossed Blaze’s face.“Fuck no,” Blaze denied, and Drake joined in, laughing. “Don’t know why you’re laughing after what Phoe pulled,” Blaze sniped, and Drake stopped laughing, and his expression darkened.“Should I ask?” I whispered, turning my head to Rock’s throat.“Phoe got sterilised, and Drake threw a shit fit to end all fits,” Rock murmured back.“Oh crap,” I whispered, and Rock squeezed me.“Drake wanted two more to make it an even twenty,” Rock replied.“Oh, they can adopt two more, surely?” I exclaimed, and Drake’s gaze shot to my face, and I bit my lip. Slowly, a wicked smile crossed Drake’s face, and I guessed I’d put my foot straight in it. Oops, so much for sister bonds. Phoe would kill me.“Sure can, sweetness, and on that note….” Drake strode away.“Damn, you’re in for it now. Phoe has threatened to cut the balls off a brother and cut an old lady if anyone suggested that to Drake,” Blaze said and shook his head. “Nice knowing ya.” Blaze strode from the room and left me with a chuckling Rock.“You’ll protect me?” I asked, teasing and Rock glanced at me.“Ain’t got kids, Carly, I need my balls to give you kids. Phoe’s sneaky; you’re on your own!” My mouth opened and closed, and I narrowed my eyes.“Kids?” I muttered, and Rock relaxed back against the pillows.“Give you a few months before springing them on ya, baby,” Rock said, supremely confident in his abilities to knock me up.“A few years is reasonable,” I quipped.“Don’t make me do a Jett,” Rock whispered and kissed the sensitive part of my throat. I blanched; the entire clubhouse knew what to do a Jett meant. Jett had chased Sin around, throwing away her birth control pills until she’d got pregnant. And it looks like Jett had succeeded again. I slapped Rock’s meaty thigh lightly.“Don’t make me do a Phoe; you know I’m capable of it,” I said, referring to cutting his balls off. Rock stiffened and then relaxed, laughing.“We’ll revisit this in a few months,” Rock teased. Yeah, sure we would.“I better get showered if we’re going out, I’ll need my bank card,” I said, but Rock hauled me back against him.“Carly, you understand what’s happening, babe? I’m claimin’ you?” Rock asked.“Yes,” I said.“That means, babe, I get to cherish and look after you. Now I can see that’s going to be a battle because it’s not something you’re used to. But you’ve seen how Rage treats their women; you’re not a stranger to seeing it. But you’re a stranger for it being aimed at you. Let me take care of you, Carly, and don’t fight me on this,” Rock asked, and I thought that over. Rock was right. No one had ever taken care of me since Mom died. I was used to being fiercely independent and surviving. Rock was offering more than survival; he was offering to protect and care for me.“Okay, I won’t fight you for now. But there’s stuff you need to understand, Rock. Like, I want to get an education; I can’t ever imagine leaving Made by Rage, but I want an education. Second, there’s no point buying lots of clothes today, you see how skinny I am? Pointless buying lots when I’m sure to regain the weight I lost. And I need a haircut please, Barney cut my hair with a pair of shears, and it’s a mess,” I said, pursing my lips. My long hair was gone. Barney had done a right number on my hair, and I hated it. Rock soothed me by brushing his hand over my throat.“Whatever you want, but Doc Paul said the best way for you to gain weight is to eat lots of small meals. Doc doesn’t think your stomach will cope with three enormous meals a day. Which means get showered and your ass dressed, and I can take you for breakfast at the Reading Nook,” Rock said and gave me a slight push. I laughed as Rock patted his stomach. Rock was always eating at the Reading Nook; the man loved Penny’s food and could eat six pastries in one sitting. Damn good job Rock worked construction with Apache.The two men owned a construction company, BlackRock, a play on Apache’s surname Blackelk and Rock’s name. The company was phenomenally successful, and I knew they employed many people. They had an office downtown but were rarely in it, preferring to be outside working with their hands. I honestly didn’t know how they managed, as they had to do a shift in the shop, one in the bar and a patrol each week.I showered quickly, wondering how Rock kept so many things balanced and realised many of the brothers had other jobs. Fish ran the garage as the manager, Gunner, rented houses and worked as a carpenter in the other part of Made by Rage. Slick ran a rental company leasing over twenty properties, Manny was the second carpenter in Made by Rage, and he and Gunner produced some stunning pieces. Ezra ran a landscaping company with Slate working with him and Mac co-ran the bar with someone from Hellfire. Lex managed the Rage Shop while Blaze and Hunter had just opened a gym when I left.Everyone else, from Drake to Lowrider, etcetera, worked in the garage. It didn’t matter whether they designed bikes (Jett, Texas, Lowrider and Calamity) or whether they painted and fixed them (Ace, Axel, Drake, Savage and Gauntlet). Although Gauntlet had recently taken over the part store from Blaze when Blaze opened the gym. The brothers had supported the new enterprise, and most visited the gym several times a week; having free membership meant they used it. And on top of the businesses Rage ran, as I said, they had a shift to do in the bar, Rage Shop and a patrol.Blaze had once taken me on a walk around at the gym, and I’d been amazed. It was set over two stories, the bottom being a sauna, hot tub and a large swimming pool with changing rooms. The upstairs held two rooms for classes and a vast area dedicated to working out. They had every piece of equipment one could think of having. That put a thought into my head.“Do you think Blaze will let me use the swimming pool if I get there early?” I asked, coming out of the tiny bathroom wrapped in a towel. Rock remained lying on the bed, eyes lazily taking me in with more than a hint of interest, and I blushed. I wasn’t used to Rock being so blatant in his perusal of me.“Yeah, Blaze won’t mind,” Rock said, sitting. “Come here.” I hesitated, unsure and taking courage; I walked across and stood in front of him. Rock’s hands gently reached out, and he dragged me into his lap. His hands cupped my face, and his mouth touched mine gently. It was searching, waiting for approval, and my hands slipped into his thick hair. Rock deepened the kiss a little, his lips gently on mine and his teeth nibbling my bottom lip. A finger traced the slender contour of my throat, and I gasped, and Rock took advantage, sliding inside my mouth. I’d kissed Rock before, and when I climbed him like a monkey, our kiss had turned wild.This was a different kiss. I sensed Rock didn’t want to hurt me but wanted me to know he desired me. His tongue gently danced with mine, and I tasted mint and coffee mixed together. Rock broke the kiss, and I gazed at him, speechless. Was that all I was getting? Rock chuckled at my expression.“Pout a little harder,” Rock said, so I did, and he leant forward and nibbled my lip again. “Ah baby, I love that bottom lip of yours.”“But you stopped kissing it quick enough,” I said sulkily, and Rock smiled.“Don’t have to rush shit; certain things need to be savoured,” Rock said. Really? He was going there?“Seriously,” I gasped. “I’ve watched you drag skanks off for a quickie lots of times, now you’re denying me?” Was Rock not attracted to me then? This made little sense, but I’d little experience with men and dating.“Sweetness, you ain’t no skank, and you’re my woman. You don’t get a wham-bam, and thank you, ma’am. Carly, you get the full works, the complete effort I’m planning to put in to make you mine. By the time I’ve finished, you won’t want anyone else but me by your side.”“Wham bam and thank you, ma’am, sounds pretty good right now,” I whispered mulishly, and Rock broke into laughter.“That sure does, but as my old lady and a damn virgin Carly, you deserve better. And that don’t mean losing your virginity in a fuckin’ clubhouse back room,” Rock said and dropped a kiss on my forehead. Damn, I just got told, and there was no budging Rock when he made a decision. Nuts! Rock hauled me gently to my feet, well aware of his own strength, and marched me from his room.“Rock, I’m not dressed!” I yelped, grabbing my towel tightly as Calamity stopped in the hallway and stared at me wide-eyed. Rock grimaced and let go, and I fled back into his room.“Not a word,” Rock warned Calamity, who grinned.“Nope, not one,” Calamity said and then fled down the hallway, yelling for Drake. Rock rolled his eyes and promised revenge on the Rage prospect.I found some clean leggings, a tee one of the old ladies must have bought, and a sports bra with underwear. I dragged them on before Rock got some other bright idea and slipped my feet into my battered and torn tennis shoes. Just once I glanced at the mirror and winced, I looked like a street waif, unfed and unkempt. My hair was the overall concern; it was such a mess. Barney had hacked at it out of spite. Searching through Rock’s drawers, I found a clean bandana and wrapped it around my head. That hid most of the ugliness, but not all. But I decided it was possible to venture out in public.Rock was waiting for me in the rec room. Or rather, he was chasing Calamity around the pool table with Slick and Ezra, looking on laughing. The prospect laughed cheekily and kept throwing quips at Rock, who threw some threats of his own back. I lifted an eyebrow and wondered what the problem was. Calamity spied me and focused Rock’s attention on me.“You and I ain’t done prospect,” Rock warned as he left the laughing prospect and headed towards me. “Just remember, you got training with me tonight.” Calamity groaned loudly as Slick began laughing instead.“Prospect, you don’t learn,” Slick shouted as Calamity hung his head. Rock reached for my arm and dragged me into his side.“Have fun,” Marsha called from somewhere, and I twisted my head around, trying to find her. A hand rose from behind the bar, and I called goodbye.“Get off your knee’s woman, Fish is in the office,” Rock called and hurried me out as Marsha’s head popped over the bar and glared. Rock rushed me out the door, laughing, and I shook my head. Marsha would get him back later; I had no doubt. This teasing was a new side to Rock, one I enjoyed.“First, let’s get something done with your hair. Because if I know you, and I know you, Carly, you won’t go shopping while it’s looking like that,” Rock grunted. I bit the inside of my cheek; I couldn’t imagine Rock on the inside of a hairdressers. But fuck, not only did Rock walk me to one around the corner to Rage, but he also entered the shop and waited while the hairdresser made a miracle out of my hair. The owner had served us straight away seeing Rock’s cut. Many of the hairdressers and customers kept glancing over at Rock as he hovered by the door, eyes firmly on me and what was happening to me.It was clear. If I got upset, Rock was ready to pounce and resolve any issue that upset me. Sadly, the hairdresser tutted as she ran her hands through my shorn locks and then showed me a few styles. I picked a cute bob and, feeling daring, chose a blue, lilac and pink streak to go through my hair at the front. Rock lifted his eyebrows but nodded an agreement.“Whatever my woman wants,” he drawled, and I swear every female, under sixty and over, just melted their panties. A couple of smiling looks were aimed in my direction, but others held the expressions of, ‘what the fuck is he doing with her?’ I shrugged them away, mainly because what the hell was Rock doing with me? There was no denying the mess I looked. I was terribly underweight to the point of looking anorexic, and my hair… well, that was self-evident.The hairdresser, older than me, squeezed my shoulder in reassurance, and I smiled. She couldn’t help what the customers were saying or thinking, and there was no point in making a scene to deny the truth. I was a mess at the moment, and Rock was smoking hot. The hairdresser grinned as she caught my lustful glance at Rock and bent down.“You know, I’ve been here thirty years; I know all the bad and good that hit Rage MC. And it’s wonderful to see that man over there looking happy,” the hairdresser whispered.Surprised, I glanced at Rock and saw he did look happy, content even. As if Rock’s plan for life was coming to fruition, and he could settle back and reap the glory of it. The harshness on Rock’s face had disappeared, and the lines around his eyes weren’t as pronounced, and it hit me hard. I’d given Rock the contentment and happiness on his face. By agreeing to be his woman, Rock needed nothing else from me, bar my word. Rock had claimed his woman, and she’d claimed him back, and in the world of Rage, once the claiming was done, everything else could happen in time.Which is why Rock wasn’t in a hurry to get me into bed; I guessed he meant to build up to it. Court me, I suppose, and in doing so, Rock would indeed glue us together. Like Lowrider had waited for Lindsey, Rock was prepared to wait for me because I’d given him my word I’d be his, and that was all Rock needed. The enlightenment must have shown on my face because the hairdresser began nodding, and Rock’s gaze was fixed firmly on me. Shyly, I smiled at Rock, and he replied with his own shit-eating grin.",

      "content": "Chapter Two.I woke the following day and, for the first time in months, felt safe. Rock hadn’t asked further questions and just been happy to hold me last night. Yet Rock wasn’t in bed this morning, and I wondered where he’d gone. A quick glance at the clock next to the bed showed six in the morning, which was too early for Rock to be awake. I knew Rock didn’t rise until eight, at least. There was a knock, and Blaze popped his head through. Worried green eyes raked my face, and Blaze winced.“Should’a come to me, Carly,” Blaze said, stepping inside Rock’s room.“No, I couldn’t go to anyone, Blaze, don’t you get it? I was kept captive, my father and brothers….” I broke off, unable to continue. Rock had explained I’d rambled during my delirium but not answered what I’d said. So it was hard to guess who knew what. Blaze’s eyes certainly made me think he knew something.“No, I don’t get it. Understand I ain’t your soulmate, but we’re close, right? That makes me your alternative, and you never once mentioned psychotic fuckin’ brothers or a fuckwad father. Shit Carly, what do you expect me to say? To feel?” Blaze demanded, and I guiltily glanced away from Blaze’s piercing gaze.“Blaze… shit’s not as easy as you think,” I muttered.“Fuck that Carly, shit’s easy, you say Blaze, my family are fucked in the head, and I ran away. Oh, the assholes might come looking for me, which means they’ll hurt me. What’s fuckin’ hard about that?” Blaze demanded, and I recognised guilt in his voice. Damnit, I didn’t want Blaze to feel guilty; he’d been a good and close friend ever since I landed at Made by Rage. When I just needed a shoulder, someone to sit there and be steady, Blaze was there. He called me his little sister, but I didn’t call Blaze a brother. To me, a brother was an insult. Blaze was my best friend.Best friends meant more than brothers, especially blood brothers. Blood could betray you, and that hurt. Blaze had proven himself a friend many times over and was ultra-protective too. My not telling Blaze had hurt him, and I felt guilt rise in my throat.“Do you want to know?” I asked, and Blaze frowned.“Will you need Rock? Man will fuckin’ go nuts if you don’t tell him,” Blaze growled. But the growl was without bite. It was a worried growl, not angry. Trust me, I understood the difference.“Yeah, I can tell you both together,” I murmured and bit my nails. Rock popped up behind Blaze, and I knew they’d set me up. I offered them both a stern glance, but neither showed an ounce of guilt. What was the betting Rock had risen early to grab Blaze? Rock sauntered into the room with jeans undone and hanging low on his waist. Damn him, I bit my nails for another reason now.“Start talking,” Rock demanded and shifted me over to sit behind me on the bed. I gingerly leaned back against him; the wounds hurt, but there was a lot of residual phantom pain.“The story starts with my mother; she wasn’t a redneck, as you’d call her. No, Mom’s parents were middle class, but Mom met and fell hard for my dad. Pa as he insisted on being called. Mom was beautiful but so sad. The life Mom was promised never materialised, and when I turned seven, Mom was worn out and beaten. But there was beauty in her still. I was the last child, meaning I’d four older brothers. Each of one a backward, crude hick,” I said and wrinkled my nose. No lie, I hated my brothers, hated what I came from. It was a typical hick story.“She died?” Rock asked as Blaze slid his back down against the door as he sat and listened. Despite Blaze’s easy-going pose, I guessed he was tense.“When I was eight, I swear they killed her. Mom was nothing better than a drudge, and she gave up. She had a heart attack, but I knew those assholes killed her by wearing Mom out. Mom did everything, washed, cleaned, ironed. She held a part-time job cleaning offices and would come home and start anew in our trailer. Pa had promised her a house, a garden, and when they married, he shoved Mom in a trailer and abused her. Pa was nothing but a stinking drunk,” I spat, hate in my voice. Rock squeezed gently as I trembled in his arms.“Shit, I’d not known how much Mom had protected me from them until she died. Then my life changed overnight. Mom wasn’t even buried before they dragged me from bed at six the following day and started me on her chores. I was eight, for fuck’s sake, a child, my Mom wasn’t even cold, and they forced me to clean house. For the next ten years, I was their slave; I missed so much school, people forgot I existed.My brothers are scum; they didn’t care I was a kid. Elrond is the eldest, followed by Barney and then Otis and Chester last. They brought women home, and I learned about sex long before I should have. Kids shouldn’t see what I’ve seen,” I said, my voice fading as memories threatened to overwhelm me.“Baby, you weren’t touched?” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“Not sexually, no, but Pa and my brothers didn’t hold back on beatings if they thought I needed it. For stupid shit, such as, if I didn’t get a beer quick enough, I got beaten, that type of stuff. Rock, I don’t want to dwell on it, but it was a terrible life. When I was eighteen, I discovered Otis had sold my virginity to a scumbag, and I fled. Ran as hard and fast as I could and landed here. Do you have any idea how heavenly Rage was? How Silvie’s and Lindsey’s kindness threw me? They treated me like a decent human being. I’d never once known that.But at the back of my mind, I’d knew they’d find me again; Otis had sold me and needed me. To be on the constant lookout is wearing, it’s tiring, and I sometimes just wanted to tell you everything and beg for protection,” I whispered.“Why didn’t you, Carly?” Blaze demanded.“Look around, Blaze, look at the trouble that finds Rage; I didn’t want to bring anything else down on the club. And my brothers are assholes who will shoot first and not care if women and children get hurt. That’s how they got me to return. They’ve got friends the same as them, they could rival Rage in numbers, and they’re psychotic and full of drugs, anger, and piss. Yeah, you guys would have won, but the women and children wouldn’t have,” I said sharply. Rock and Blaze had to understand that.“Assholes blackmailed you,” Rock grunted.“Yeah, Otis found me and watched. Then Otis and Barney stalked the old ladies. They threatened Silvie and Lindsey first, then mentioned Phoe and how much they’d enjoy fucking her. A classy lady dragged down and abused would be their idea of a wet dream. I’d no choice but to go with them.”“Always a choice,” Rock grumbled, and I shook my head. There hadn’t been an option to stay.“Not when it was the old ladies or me, I chose the old ladies,” I argued, and Rock grunted. “My brothers thought they’d get my money and stuff and were fuming when they realised I had nothing on me,” I explained.“That’s why you left your bank cards and cash here,” Blaze said, and I nodded.“That was the escape plan if they found me. But I underestimated them. I hadn’t expected them to stalk the old ladies and children. The truth was, it was Pa who wanted me back more than them. The bastard beat the shit out of me when they dragged me home. But my brothers didn’t care. Pa wanted the trailer cleaned, food on the table, my money. Yeah, Otis wanted me back to fulfil the promise to his friend, but the guy was inside doing time, so Hans wasn’t a threat.Whenever I got stronger, Pa or one of them would beat me down again. Because they needed to keep me weak to stop me from running. They chained me by the ankle to the dog’s shed at night, and I slept there. I didn’t see a bath or shower for months, I used to wash in the stream, but I kept planning. Pa was weak, too much booze, and he was dying. His death was just a matter of time. As soon as Pa began choking and dying, I watched. Damn, I wanted that asshole to know I was going to win. I told him I was. Told Pa I was returning here and getting my money and planning a good life.There was so much fuckin’ hatred in Pa’s eyes. Pa wanted to kill me and couldn’t; I sat there and told him everything I planned to do and watched the bastard die. And I didn’t go for help or try to help him. I did nothing but sit there and tell Pa pretty stories of how my life would be, despite him. Maybe you’ll look at me differently, but I won’t take that back. The pleasure I got from watching evil die is unsurpassed,” I whispered, and Blaze shook his head.“Was strong, honey,” Blaze muttered. Rock merely tightened his arms.“Babe, if you’d got that cunt help, I’d have spanked your ass,” Rock muttered, and I gave a weak smile.“As soon as the police had arrived and taken Pa away, I was gone. I’d already stolen the money from his wallet and raided his savings. First, I went north, selling his car on the way and then west to buy a new one. If my brothers followed, they’d think I was heading to Canada as I used to talk about it lots. Then I drove here; I didn’t realise how ill I was, but I kept going with Rage in mind. And yeah, I expected a chilly reception, but I needed to get my card and savings so I could start anew. And then I arrived here, home,” I said, and my hands clenched on Rock’s arms.“Trust me, you’re home,” Blaze said and didn’t even bother to look at Rock for an agreement.“Home,” I said wistfully, and Rock’s arms clenched around me. “My brothers may come looking. Otis still has to provide me to his scumbag friend. But I’ve realised something, they’d never have got close to the old ladies and children. The assholes played on my fears, but I forgot how strong Rage and their women are. Artemis would take them out in the blink of an eye, even if she was nine months pregnant and in labour. Ingrained fear of them allowed them to play me, and I fell for it.Was so stupid to believe they’d get close to Rage. They’d never get into HQ or reach the girls at Made by Rage. Sin always has Reid or Jett with her, and I was so damn idiotic. I let love blind me to the facts, love for the old ladies, and Otis screwed me right over. The marks on my back and legs are where they tried to break me and couldn’t.See, I’d tasted freedom; I understood there was a better life for me. Even if Rage turned against me when I returned, and I wouldn’t have blamed you, I was stronger because I’d known you. Discovering Made by Rage was the single best thing that ever happened to me. Otis and Elrond are uneducated, but they know how to scare people. Stupidly, I forgot that about them, I’ve been here two years and thought myself safe, and I forgot how vindictive they were,” I said. Blaze looked furious, beside himself with anger. I couldn’t see Rock, but I imagined his face was no better.“How did they find you?” Blaze gritted out.“That damned reporter who took a shot of Made by Rage workshop. He took it without me knowing he was doing so, and they saw it in an article. How the magazine ended up in their hands, who the hell knows,” I said.“Where do they live?” Rock asked.“They have a small trailer park hidden from the rangers in the middle of the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee. So easy to lose people there,” I replied.“Huh, I don’t get how an article on Made by Rage ended up in Tennessee,” Blaze murmured.“Neither do I, but it did, and they came for me,” I replied. “My family lived so far off the grid we could have been lost forever. The closest town was Gatlinburg, which was a couple of hours from where we lived,” I explained. After Mom’s death, my brothers and father had fled into the mountains, preferring not to have eyes on them.“What’s the possibility of them coming for you?” Rock grunted.“Fifty-fifty. Otis has spent the money he charged for me. The asshole he sold me to won’t settle for money. Hans will want me, and Otis will need to capture me. But I kept telling stories of how bad guys had tried to defeat you, and you kept beating them down. So that may give them pause for thought. And I also played on the strength of the relationship between Rage, Hawthorne and RCPD. Maybe I shouldn’t have come back, but I needed my cards and money,” I said sadly. The truth was, I may have brought even more trouble down on these wonderful men.Sure, most of the Rage brothers had grim, stern expressions and could be viewed as surly. But they’d go down shooting for anyone they cared about. Rage embodied the meaning of family; they didn’t care if you shared blood. They made family out of loyalty, honour and strength. Rage bled for each other, and if someone hurt, the others made sure they healed. Rage had been a completely foreign idea to me, people pulling together like they did. I’d never heard of such a thing, didn’t believe a concept like Rage existed.Family to me was harsh and cruel, unsupportive and abusive. A family that not only came together but worked together to ensure everyone’s happiness. Alien. Obviously, I’d not had much education, but Rage was above normal family standards from what I saw. At first, I’d been shocked by their actions. Silvie taking me into her home on the first day had knocked me for six. Lowrider, Drake, and Ace coming for me when Jumbo wanted to make me one of his whores. Who did that? No one in my book.Then I watched as Lowrider broke his back to win Lindsey and how Rage and their friends sought to keep her safe. I watched as Gunner treated Silvie so preciously and how torn he was between Autumn and Silvie. Men did not treat women as Rage did. Men slapped, pinched and abused. But not Rage. When one of them lost their temper, I was terrified and waited for fists to fly, but all they did was shout at their woman. Not once did I see a fist clench or raised to slap. And their woman shouted straight back without fear.Rage needed to be respected. While their women got into their faces, the women didn’t cross a certain line. Well, not unless your name was Artemis. No one could control her. Every man with an old lady cherished them, indulged their woman’s whims, took pride in their accomplishments. Again, that was something strange. I wondered why Rage did that, and slowly over time, I realised, because that is what love was. Boosting your other half to make them feel good. And I’d watched as the women did the same in return, making sure the men had silent support, cooking or buying favourite meals, just because. There wasn’t a reason; it was just because.And over time, I became one of the old ladies loosely; I’d taken the first step when I stabbed Lindsey’s ex-husband. I took the second step when I defended Silvie. But then I allowed my brothers to take that away, steal my identity and make me a drudge again. Stupidly, I’d caved and forgot the lessons Rage had taught, and although my body may be bruised and battered, my mind wasn’t. Actual strength came from within, the ability to withstand anything and walk-through fire.A movement made me glance up, and I stared as Drake lounged in the doorway. Drake’s face was impassive, but his eyes, as usual, were full of fire and emotion. Drake could control his face, but never his eyes. Brown eyes raked me from head to toe and then glanced at the silent man behind me and the second now sitting on my bed. Drake seemed to be seeking something, and when he found it, his eyes flared again.“About time you realised,” Drake muttered. Realised? “Carly, you’re stronger than you thought, stronger with us, and stronger with Rock behind you.”“Yes, I was stupid,” I said.“Yeah, tremendously.” Typical Drake, not mincing his words. “And see what stupidity brought. Woman, you should have come straight to us and let us protect you. As of now, Carly girl, you see hide or hair of those assholes, you shout and shout fucking loudly.” I frowned, puzzled; I thought the saying was hide nor hair, but Drake’s eyes dared me to challenge him.“Okay,” I replied.“Rock mentioned you might want your back tattooed over. Last I saw, it was a fuckin’ mess. Consequences Carly. What you did was damn brave, sacrificing yourself for the old ladies, but maybe now you realise that the sacrifice was unnecessary and fuckin’ stupid. Put yourself through hell for no reason. Whatever. Gotta let your wounds heal before we even look at tattooing. Scars may be too thick, and you might need surgery to remove the worst, and then we tattoo over it. Don’t jump before I say and don’t go running to another shop. We got people who do our tats right here in Rage, and Hellfire has a couple of talented artists,” Drake ordered.“Okay,” I said because there was no arguing with Drake when he laid the law down. Shit just wasn’t worth it.“Make sure Carly obeys,” Drake told Rock, who grunted with amusement. Blaze grinned as my head snapped up at the word obey. Irately, I pursed my lips, and Drake nodded in approval.“There she is, the fighter. We’re gonna keep prodding at you until you understand she’s there. We seen you strong Carly, we seen you quiet and reflective, need to see the fighter now.”“But I don’t like confrontations,” I said, and the three men threw their heads back in laughter.“Bullshit. What you call stabbing a man? What you call taking Silvie’s side. Fuck me, the girl don’t like confrontations,” Drake chuckled.“Might not like them, but you can handle them,” Blaze agreed, nodding. I wanted to bop him on the head, but Blaze would only bop me back. Blaze strongly believed in equal rights.“We got a fuckin’ party going on I don’t know about? Because if not, my woman’s screwing because she wants her girl in the workshop,” Lowrider said, appearing behind Drake. Lowrider’s mock glower warmed me; it was an expression I was very familiar with. Lowrider often used it when he was arguing with Lindsey, and she walked straight across his argument.“Rider,” Axel bellowed and clapped Lowrider on the back, and Lowrider stumbled forward a few steps.“Axel, for fuck’s sake,” Lowrider groused.“There she is. About time you got your fuckin’ head on straight. Now get out of bed; Lindsey’s screwing,” Axel boomed.“Just told Carly that,” Lowrider chuffed.“Well, Lindsey’s gonna have to wait. Carly needs shit,” Rock replied, and I glanced up.“I do?” I asked.“Where’s your clothes and shit?” Rock asked pointedly.“Oh,” I said. Rock was right; I needed stuff. My brothers had made me pack everything, and they’d sold most of it.“Thought so,” Rock grunted. Drake and Rock exchanged glances over my head.“I’ll pull Jett in to cover your shift at the bar, take Carly shopping,” Drake said. I shook my head.“Drake, I can wait for stuff,” I said, and Drake frowned, and I hushed.“The fuck you can, do as you’re told,” Drake said, and I nodded. If Drake told me to go shopping, then shopping it was.“Don’t think the challenger a good idea for Carly; I need a pickup,” Rock said, and Lowrider dragged a set of keys from his pocket. Deftly he threw them at Rock, who let go of me and caught them.“Take tonight too,” Drake said, and Rock nodded. Rock’s beard tickled my neck as he sank his head back into me. I raised a hand to cup his face, and Rock dropped a kiss on my palm.“Rider, go back to Lindsey before she dropkicks you for leaving her with the kids while she’s trying to feed the baby and work,” Drake ordered. Shit, I’d missed the births of Sin and Jett’s baby, Drake and Phoe’s, and Lindsey had also had hers. Deep guilt struck me, but I was also euphoric that they’d given birth safely and without stress.“The babies?” I asked, and Drake’s mouth twitched.“Sin and Jett have a little girl, Brooke. Lindsey gave birth to a boy, Elijah, and Phoe and I had a little girl, Peyton,” Drake said, his mouth softening.“So, who’s knocked up?” I asked bluntly, and Drake roared with laughter. Rock’s body shook behind me, and Blaze broke into a smile.“Marsha is again. Seems now they’ve dropped one set they’ve done it again,” Rock murmured.“Twins again?” I gasped.“Fuck no, Marsha will kill Fish. Just one. Gunner’s knocked Autumn up, and she’s cursing; that’s twins again. Silvie is due in the next couple of weeks. Artemis is knocked up again, and so is Sin,” Drake rattled their names off, and my eyes grew wide.“What is it with you brothers to keep knocking up your women?” I gasped.“Keeps us busy, makes baby boys for brothers and little girls for old ladies,” Drake grinned, and I chuckled.“Incest!” I spouted, and Drake looked horrified.“Not at all!” Blaze said, laughing. “Just creating the next generation of Rage.” My jaw dropped open, and I stared at Blaze in shock.“You claimed an old lady and knocked her up?” I gasped, and Rock began shaking harder at the expression that crossed Blaze’s face.“Fuck no,” Blaze denied, and Drake joined in, laughing. “Don’t know why you’re laughing after what Phoe pulled,” Blaze sniped, and Drake stopped laughing, and his expression darkened.“Should I ask?” I whispered, turning my head to Rock’s throat.“Phoe got sterilised, and Drake threw a shit fit to end all fits,” Rock murmured back.“Oh crap,” I whispered, and Rock squeezed me.“Drake wanted two more to make it an even twenty,” Rock replied.“Oh, they can adopt two more, surely?” I exclaimed, and Drake’s gaze shot to my face, and I bit my lip. Slowly, a wicked smile crossed Drake’s face, and I guessed I’d put my foot straight in it. Oops, so much for sister bonds. Phoe would kill me.“Sure can, sweetness, and on that note….” Drake strode away.“Damn, you’re in for it now. Phoe has threatened to cut the balls off a brother and cut an old lady if anyone suggested that to Drake,” Blaze said and shook his head. “Nice knowing ya.” Blaze strode from the room and left me with a chuckling Rock.“You’ll protect me?” I asked, teasing and Rock glanced at me.“Ain’t got kids, Carly, I need my balls to give you kids. Phoe’s sneaky; you’re on your own!” My mouth opened and closed, and I narrowed my eyes.“Kids?” I muttered, and Rock relaxed back against the pillows.“Give you a few months before springing them on ya, baby,” Rock said, supremely confident in his abilities to knock me up.“A few years is reasonable,” I quipped.“Don’t make me do a Jett,” Rock whispered and kissed the sensitive part of my throat. I blanched; the entire clubhouse knew what to do a Jett meant. Jett had chased Sin around, throwing away her birth control pills until she’d got pregnant. And it looks like Jett had succeeded again. I slapped Rock’s meaty thigh lightly.“Don’t make me do a Phoe; you know I’m capable of it,” I said, referring to cutting his balls off. Rock stiffened and then relaxed, laughing.“We’ll revisit this in a few months,” Rock teased. Yeah, sure we would.“I better get showered if we’re going out, I’ll need my bank card,” I said, but Rock hauled me back against him.“Carly, you understand what’s happening, babe? I’m claimin’ you?” Rock asked.“Yes,” I said.“That means, babe, I get to cherish and look after you. Now I can see that’s going to be a battle because it’s not something you’re used to. But you’ve seen how Rage treats their women; you’re not a stranger to seeing it. But you’re a stranger for it being aimed at you. Let me take care of you, Carly, and don’t fight me on this,” Rock asked, and I thought that over. Rock was right. No one had ever taken care of me since Mom died. I was used to being fiercely independent and surviving. Rock was offering more than survival; he was offering to protect and care for me.“Okay, I won’t fight you for now. But there’s stuff you need to understand, Rock. Like, I want to get an education; I can’t ever imagine leaving Made by Rage, but I want an education. Second, there’s no point buying lots of clothes today, you see how skinny I am? Pointless buying lots when I’m sure to regain the weight I lost. And I need a haircut please, Barney cut my hair with a pair of shears, and it’s a mess,” I said, pursing my lips. My long hair was gone. Barney had done a right number on my hair, and I hated it. Rock soothed me by brushing his hand over my throat.“Whatever you want, but Doc Paul said the best way for you to gain weight is to eat lots of small meals. Doc doesn’t think your stomach will cope with three enormous meals a day. Which means get showered and your ass dressed, and I can take you for breakfast at the Reading Nook,” Rock said and gave me a slight push. I laughed as Rock patted his stomach. Rock was always eating at the Reading Nook; the man loved Penny’s food and could eat six pastries in one sitting. Damn good job Rock worked construction with Apache.The two men owned a construction company, BlackRock, a play on Apache’s surname Blackelk and Rock’s name. The company was phenomenally successful, and I knew they employed many people. They had an office downtown but were rarely in it, preferring to be outside working with their hands. I honestly didn’t know how they managed, as they had to do a shift in the shop, one in the bar and a patrol each week.I showered quickly, wondering how Rock kept so many things balanced and realised many of the brothers had other jobs. Fish ran the garage as the manager, Gunner, rented houses and worked as a carpenter in the other part of Made by Rage. Slick ran a rental company leasing over twenty properties, Manny was the second carpenter in Made by Rage, and he and Gunner produced some stunning pieces. Ezra ran a landscaping company with Slate working with him and Mac co-ran the bar with someone from Hellfire. Lex managed the Rage Shop while Blaze and Hunter had just opened a gym when I left.Everyone else, from Drake to Lowrider, etcetera, worked in the garage. It didn’t matter whether they designed bikes (Jett, Texas, Lowrider and Calamity) or whether they painted and fixed them (Ace, Axel, Drake, Savage and Gauntlet). Although Gauntlet had recently taken over the part store from Blaze when Blaze opened the gym. The brothers had supported the new enterprise, and most visited the gym several times a week; having free membership meant they used it. And on top of the businesses Rage ran, as I said, they had a shift to do in the bar, Rage Shop and a patrol.Blaze had once taken me on a walk around at the gym, and I’d been amazed. It was set over two stories, the bottom being a sauna, hot tub and a large swimming pool with changing rooms. The upstairs held two rooms for classes and a vast area dedicated to working out. They had every piece of equipment one could think of having. That put a thought into my head.“Do you think Blaze will let me use the swimming pool if I get there early?” I asked, coming out of the tiny bathroom wrapped in a towel. Rock remained lying on the bed, eyes lazily taking me in with more than a hint of interest, and I blushed. I wasn’t used to Rock being so blatant in his perusal of me.“Yeah, Blaze won’t mind,” Rock said, sitting. “Come here.” I hesitated, unsure and taking courage; I walked across and stood in front of him. Rock’s hands gently reached out, and he dragged me into his lap. His hands cupped my face, and his mouth touched mine gently. It was searching, waiting for approval, and my hands slipped into his thick hair. Rock deepened the kiss a little, his lips gently on mine and his teeth nibbling my bottom lip. A finger traced the slender contour of my throat, and I gasped, and Rock took advantage, sliding inside my mouth. I’d kissed Rock before, and when I climbed him like a monkey, our kiss had turned wild.This was a different kiss. I sensed Rock didn’t want to hurt me but wanted me to know he desired me. His tongue gently danced with mine, and I tasted mint and coffee mixed together. Rock broke the kiss, and I gazed at him, speechless. Was that all I was getting? Rock chuckled at my expression.“Pout a little harder,” Rock said, so I did, and he leant forward and nibbled my lip again. “Ah baby, I love that bottom lip of yours.”“But you stopped kissing it quick enough,” I said sulkily, and Rock smiled.“Don’t have to rush shit; certain things need to be savoured,” Rock said. Really? He was going there?“Seriously,” I gasped. “I’ve watched you drag skanks off for a quickie lots of times, now you’re denying me?” Was Rock not attracted to me then? This made little sense, but I’d little experience with men and dating.“Sweetness, you ain’t no skank, and you’re my woman. You don’t get a wham-bam, and thank you, ma’am. Carly, you get the full works, the complete effort I’m planning to put in to make you mine. By the time I’ve finished, you won’t want anyone else but me by your side.”“Wham bam and thank you, ma’am, sounds pretty good right now,” I whispered mulishly, and Rock broke into laughter.“That sure does, but as my old lady and a damn virgin Carly, you deserve better. And that don’t mean losing your virginity in a fuckin’ clubhouse back room,” Rock said and dropped a kiss on my forehead. Damn, I just got told, and there was no budging Rock when he made a decision. Nuts! Rock hauled me gently to my feet, well aware of his own strength, and marched me from his room.“Rock, I’m not dressed!” I yelped, grabbing my towel tightly as Calamity stopped in the hallway and stared at me wide-eyed. Rock grimaced and let go, and I fled back into his room.“Not a word,” Rock warned Calamity, who grinned.“Nope, not one,” Calamity said and then fled down the hallway, yelling for Drake. Rock rolled his eyes and promised revenge on the Rage prospect.I found some clean leggings, a tee one of the old ladies must have bought, and a sports bra with underwear. I dragged them on before Rock got some other bright idea and slipped my feet into my battered and torn tennis shoes. Just once I glanced at the mirror and winced, I looked like a street waif, unfed and unkempt. My hair was the overall concern; it was such a mess. Barney had hacked at it out of spite. Searching through Rock’s drawers, I found a clean bandana and wrapped it around my head. That hid most of the ugliness, but not all. But I decided it was possible to venture out in public.Rock was waiting for me in the rec room. Or rather, he was chasing Calamity around the pool table with Slick and Ezra, looking on laughing. The prospect laughed cheekily and kept throwing quips at Rock, who threw some threats of his own back. I lifted an eyebrow and wondered what the problem was. Calamity spied me and focused Rock’s attention on me.“You and I ain’t done prospect,” Rock warned as he left the laughing prospect and headed towards me. “Just remember, you got training with me tonight.” Calamity groaned loudly as Slick began laughing instead.“Prospect, you don’t learn,” Slick shouted as Calamity hung his head. Rock reached for my arm and dragged me into his side.“Have fun,” Marsha called from somewhere, and I twisted my head around, trying to find her. A hand rose from behind the bar, and I called goodbye.“Get off your knee’s woman, Fish is in the office,” Rock called and hurried me out as Marsha’s head popped over the bar and glared. Rock rushed me out the door, laughing, and I shook my head. Marsha would get him back later; I had no doubt. This teasing was a new side to Rock, one I enjoyed.“First, let’s get something done with your hair. Because if I know you, and I know you, Carly, you won’t go shopping while it’s looking like that,” Rock grunted. I bit the inside of my cheek; I couldn’t imagine Rock on the inside of a hairdressers. But fuck, not only did Rock walk me to one around the corner to Rage, but he also entered the shop and waited while the hairdresser made a miracle out of my hair. The owner had served us straight away seeing Rock’s cut. Many of the hairdressers and customers kept glancing over at Rock as he hovered by the door, eyes firmly on me and what was happening to me.It was clear. If I got upset, Rock was ready to pounce and resolve any issue that upset me. Sadly, the hairdresser tutted as she ran her hands through my shorn locks and then showed me a few styles. I picked a cute bob and, feeling daring, chose a blue, lilac and pink streak to go through my hair at the front. Rock lifted his eyebrows but nodded an agreement.“Whatever my woman wants,” he drawled, and I swear every female, under sixty and over, just melted their panties. A couple of smiling looks were aimed in my direction, but others held the expressions of, ‘what the fuck is he doing with her?’ I shrugged them away, mainly because what the hell was Rock doing with me? There was no denying the mess I looked. I was terribly underweight to the point of looking anorexic, and my hair… well, that was self-evident.The hairdresser, older than me, squeezed my shoulder in reassurance, and I smiled. She couldn’t help what the customers were saying or thinking, and there was no point in making a scene to deny the truth. I was a mess at the moment, and Rock was smoking hot. The hairdresser grinned as she caught my lustful glance at Rock and bent down.“You know, I’ve been here thirty years; I know all the bad and good that hit Rage MC. And it’s wonderful to see that man over there looking happy,” the hairdresser whispered.Surprised, I glanced at Rock and saw he did look happy, content even. As if Rock’s plan for life was coming to fruition, and he could settle back and reap the glory of it. The harshness on Rock’s face had disappeared, and the lines around his eyes weren’t as pronounced, and it hit me hard. I’d given Rock the contentment and happiness on his face. By agreeing to be his woman, Rock needed nothing else from me, bar my word. Rock had claimed his woman, and she’d claimed him back, and in the world of Rage, once the claiming was done, everything else could happen in time.Which is why Rock wasn’t in a hurry to get me into bed; I guessed he meant to build up to it. Court me, I suppose, and in doing so, Rock would indeed glue us together. Like Lowrider had waited for Lindsey, Rock was prepared to wait for me because I’d given him my word I’d be his, and that was all Rock needed. The enlightenment must have shown on my face because the hairdresser began nodding, and Rock’s gaze was fixed firmly on me. Shyly, I smiled at Rock, and he replied with his own shit-eating grin.",

      "content": "Chapter Three.I felt far better when we left the hair salon. My hair was now a sleek, pretty coloured bob, and I kept pulling the coloured strands forward to look at them. I don’t know what I’d expected, but the three colours were interwoven with each other, making it a rainbow in my hair. And I loved the effect, and Rock realised that and smiled smugly. Rock stopped me in the middle of the street and took a photo so I could see. Not as much fun as pulling the strands forward, but I appreciated the thought.“Carly, I miss your long hair,” Rock said, taking a strand and letting it slip through his fingers.“Then I’ll grow it back just for you,” I murmured, looking across at the clothing shops Rock had stopped nearby. These were high-end shops, and while I didn’t doubt they’d have clothes to fit me, I wasn’t a high maintenance girl.“Yeah, you do that, baby,” Rock said.“Look, can’t we go to Target or Walmart? I just need a few basics Rock, I’ll be gaining weight hopefully soon, so these clothes won’t last long,” I said, not wanting to enter the high priced shops.“True, but I want you to have a few pretty dresses, so when I take you out, you feel good,” Rock said, gazing into my eyes earnestly. Damn, how could anyone say no to those beautiful, begging eyes without being a wicked bitch? Humour and smugness glinted in Rock’s eyes, and I knew I’d been played.“Fine,” I huffed, but without any strength behind it.“Carly, will you be okay for a few minutes? I just need to pick something up, and I won’t be more than five minutes,” Rock asked, and I hesitated. No, I didn’t want to be alone. Fear of my brothers threatened to overwhelm me. Shivers ran down my spine, and goosebumps rose on my arms. Rock noticed immediately and sought to soothe me by stroking my back gently.“Yeah,” I muttered, and Rock shook his head.“Nah, I’ll walk you over and see you safely inside, and then run my task. Honest Carly, I won’t leave you for more than a few minutes. Find several dresses; I rarely saw your pretty legs and want to see them on our dates,” Rock said, and I wondered if I should swoon. Rock wanted to date me, court me. He wasn’t going in gung-ho like the other brothers. Maybe Rock realised I’d be frightened of that, as I’d been dominated far too long.Yeah, I wasn’t the only one who’d been assaulted or hurt. Phoe, Lindsey, and Sin had, too. Silvie had been badly injured when she’d been run over by a rival gang. At first, I thought my brothers had been behind Silvie being hurt and was so relieved they hadn’t been. The guilt of my best friend being run over because of me was more than I could have handled.The difference between Phoe, Sin, Silvie and me was, they’d had time to get over their abuse, or it happened when in their relationship. Which meant their men went out of the way to protect them while I’d dealt with the abuse alone.Lindsey had been in the middle of an abusive marriage when she’d fled to Rage. And while I’d come to her battles late, I’d seen first-hand how Lindsey had put herself back together and how Lowrider had supported her. With Rock’s support, I’d recover so I wouldn’t be afraid of my shadow. Rock squeezed my shoulder as we reached the shop entrance, and I gazed with trepidation at the posh interior.“A few minutes Carly, that’s it,” Rock said, and I nodded. Rock dropped a brief kiss on my lips to bolster my courage, and I watched as his long legs strode away. Cautiously, I pushed open the door and entered. Yeah, this was a lovely shop, with clean lines and eye-catching displays. The clothes were expensive and of high quality. Quietly, I began browsing, keeping my head low as I searched for dresses that would make Rock’s eyes pop. I found three in the first few minutes and checked for their smallest size, which I thought may still be too big for me. I saw two snooty saleswomen by a desk and moved closer, intending to ask where changing rooms were.“Like she can afford to buy anything here,” one girl sneered, her back to me. Her colleague was facing her and sneered, not seeing me behind a rack of clothing.“I’ll flip you for it; I don’t want to serve her either. Waste of time. She looks like she just escaped from a Nazi prison camp.” The second girl giggled, and I winced as the barb hit home. Tears filled my eyes. Even with my new haircut, I was still a mess. I looked at the three dresses and my hands clenched. Pretty clothing wouldn’t hide the ugliness.“Deal, loser gets to serve that, as I got better things to do with my time than wait on her. Why on earth does she think she can afford anything in here, doesn’t our shop scream couture and money? She’s more Target than couture.” My head sank to my chest. The girl was correct. My shame deepened as I heard them flip, and one of them cry out at losing. They began a battle over best out of three, and I stepped back into an extremely large, angrily vibrating body. Rock’s arms clamped around me, and I twisted and buried my head in Rock’s chest.“Oh,” one girl said, sounding stunned.“Where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock thundered, and I clung tighter to him.“What?” girl one asked, sounding stunned and a little afraid.“Said, where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock repeated as his hand stroked my back, at odds with his aggressive tone.“Hello, I’m here, can I help?” a woman said, hurrying over. I felt the heat of Rock’s glower, even though I couldn’t see it.“Your two cunts here just got your shop blacklisted. My girl came here to get a few dresses, and those two bitches were tearing her apart, saying she couldn’t afford to shop here. How the fuck do they know who my girl is? And then the bitches they are likened my woman to a prisoner in a concentration camp,” Rock said furiously.“Rock,” I whispered, and his hand pushed me into his chest harder.“I… I… don’t use language like that in my shop, sir. I can apologise for my salesgirls….”“No fuckin’ buts. Know who I am? Who I belong to? Yeah, and when Rage blacklists a business, it goes under damn quick. Rage just blacklisted you. And FYI bitches, my girl was kidnapped and held hostage for six months. Maybe Rage ought to teach you a lesson on how to look good when you’ve been held for six months,” Rock threatened, and the girls paled. One began crying as Rock took the three dresses from my hand and threw them on the floor. Growling unhappily, Rock pulled his phone from his back pocket and dialled a number.“Phoenix put the word out, A Touch of Class is blacklisted, just insulted Carly,” Rock growled. Phoe replied, and Rock said that I was okay. He hung up, holding the eyes of the manager and called Drake and repeated his message.“Next time before you bitches open your mouth, don’t fuckin’ judge a person,” Rock told them and escorted me out of the shop. The manager began yelling at the girls as we left, and Rock steered me away.“Are you going to blacklist that shop?” I asked as Rock steered me towards another shop.“Fuck yeah, and tonight those two bitches are gonna get the fright of their spoiled bitch life,” Rock said.“Rock, they learned their lesson,” I said placatingly.“Don’t give a fuck,” Rock answered back, and I let it drop. I recognised that tone. I’d heard it in most brothers when they’d made their minds up. “Phoe recommended this shop; it’s new and just opened,” Rock said and opened the door, guiding me inside it. A cheerful, beautifully dressed salesgirl came rushing over, smiling at us.“Hello, welcome to Maddison’s Magic. Can I just say, I love your hair!” she said, beaming at me.“Thank you,” I said, her words a balm to my wounded ego.“How may I help you?”“My girl needs jeans, leggings, and tops. And at least three nice dresses suitable for fine dining. Actually, make that five,” Rock mused with a frown. “She doesn’t want too much, Carly’s been through some shit and lost weight, but she’s putting it back on slowly. So treat her right, and we’ll return when she needs more clothes,” Rock warned, and the girl grinned.“I’m Maddy, the Maddison on the sign, and I don’t need to be warned to treat a customer correctly. Now sweetie, let’s find you some clothing that will expand for a couple of sizes as you gain weight. Then you get more wear out of them,” Maddy said, smiling. I liked this cheerful girl and her positive attitude. Maddy took me to a sofa, and I sat as she rummaged through her racks and brought me clothing. Happily, Maddy encouraged me to try on leggings and jeans, tutting when she thought something looked wrong and grinning when she thought it was perfect.To my surprise, Rock seemed perfectly at ease being in a dress shop, watching me try clothing on, and modelling it for him. I’d have been happy with a trip to Target. Rock sat in a chair and played with his phone, glancing up as I exited the changing room. Maddy jumped in before Rock did, agreeing or disagreeing with the clothing I was modelling. After two hours, I finally called quits. I was too tired to continue, and I wanted food and rest. Maddy cheerfully chatted to Rock, not put off by his grunts as she bagged up my purchases and then offered a five percent discount.I’ll give Maddy her due. She was a canny businesswoman. By offering Rock five percent, she guaranteed he’d bring me back. Rock had insisted I wear a pretty yellow dress he’d picked, and I’d a cardigan over it. He glanced outside and realised I needed a coat, and Maddy sprang into action, picking three for me. Rock paid for them and slipped the first over my arms like a gentleman would. It was a lovely camel colour in thick-lined wool, falling to my knees and with a wide tanned leather belt. Rock also picked up a hat, scarf, and gloves and paid for them at the same time. Once again, Maddy offered the discount.Rock led me to his Dodge Charger, threw the bags inside the trunk, and asked where I wanted to eat. To be honest, I didn’t care; I needed food as my stomach was cramping painfully. I’d be happy grabbing something at the Reading Nook. Instead, Rock drove to Bernard’s restaurant and parked at the back. As we got out, I realised I still wore my shoddy sneakers and stopped walking.“Baby?” Rock asked, seeing the concern on my face.“Rock my shoes,” I whispered. Rock dropped his gaze to my feet and stepped forward, and wrapped an arm around me tightly.“Let anyone dare comment, baby,” Rock said, trying to reassure me. Without a further argument, he steered me into Bernard’s and the man himself came hurrying towards us. After effusive greetings, Bernard led us to a cosy table in the corner. Rock took the chair next to the wall so he could see what was coming, and I appreciated it. Bernard offered us his special of the day, to which Rock agreed, and I sat there squirming. There was no doubt Bernard’s was fine dining. The people surrounding us confirmed that, as did the décor. But Bernard himself was down to earth and friendly.Of course, I’d met him several times when he’d come to the clubhouse with his husband, Stefan, who was a close friend of Phoe. But dining in his restaurant was an entirely different matter. This was the man’s business, and he intended to spoil us, judging by his reaction. Bernard brought our drinks and appetisers, and I tucked in straight away. Rock had ordered a variety of tapas. I could have inhaled them; I was so hungry.“So, what do you fancy doing next? Shall we go shoe shopping?” Rock asked.“Yeah, I need some as, unfortunately, my sneakers don’t go with the dresses. Perhaps a pair of new sneakers and a nice pair of shoes for the dress?” I suggested, and Rock took on a mulish look before nodding. He’d agreed too quickly, and I was suspicious. As a waitress cleared away our plates, Rock reached into his cut pocket and withdrew several jewellery boxes. I gazed at the four boxes as Rock pushed them in front of me.“What are they?” I asked.“Ordered them the day after you returned, and I knew the truth,” Rock grunted. He nudged one towards me with a long finger, and I picked it up. Excited, I untied the ribbon and flicked the lid open and made an O with my mouth. Inside was a gold chain with an oval-shaped pendant containing a diamond.“How pretty,” I said, gazing at it. Rock rose to his feet, reached for the box, took the necklace out, and fastened it around my neck. He dropped a kiss on my neck and sat back down, and shoved a second box at me. Cheekily smiling, I opened it and discovered a matching bracelet. The third box held matching earrings, and the fourth an anklet.“Didn’t get you a ring because I know it interferes with your work. Lindsey is always bitching her rings have caught on something,” Rock said.“I didn’t expect these,” I said, smiling happily. I loved presents, presents felt better than Rock buying me clothes because I was needy.“Carly, you expect nothing,” Rock teased. Bernard approached with our mains. Rock had ordered the surf and turf platter, which with Bernard’s flourish meant two T-Bone steaks, lobster in a shell, crab, and king prawns. Added to that feast was calamari with a 16 oz gammon steak, ribs and a butterfly chicken breast. There was a large basket of fries and another containing garlic bread, and a third with garlic breaded mushrooms. A waitress brought dipping sauces. My eyes widened in horror at the amount of food, and Bernard laughed.“Enjoy!” Bernard chortled and disappeared.“Where do we start?” I asked, lost in the aromas floating from the platter. Rock pulled two plates towards him, cut the chicken breast in half, and did the same with the ribs and steak. Next, he added fries and sides and shoved a plate towards me.“Are you claiming the lobster?” I teased, and Rock winked. He cracked the shell open and scooped a forkful of the meat out, and held it out to me. I leaned forward and went to take the fork, and Rock moved it away. Then, with a wicked glint in his eyes, Rock offered the fork again, and this time when I leant forward, Rock placed the fork in my mouth. My eyes watered in pleasure. The lobster was succulent and delicious. Wow, Bernard could undoubtedly cook! As we ate, we chatted about Rock’s work and halfway through, I sat back and rubbed my stomach.“Damn, I’m full,” I muttered. Rock glanced at me dubiously, so I nodded to confirm my words. “Please finish; it would be a shame to waste the food; it was so wonderful.” Rock didn’t need telling twice, and finally, the platters were clean, and Rock sat back with a satisfied grunt. He patted his belly and grinned at me.“That’s earned you an extra half an hour at the gym,” I teased, and Rock chuckled.“Fuckin’ worth it, princess, man I could eat here every day,” Rock said.“The food was amazing; it’s the first time I’ve ever eaten here,” I said, and Rock nodded.“Rapid City got some great restaurants, but Bernard’s is most definitely the best. Hate to be one of those fuckers who have to book or take a risk on getting a table, love the fact we can get a table whenever we want. Change of subject, Carly, you ever been to Mount Rushmore?” I blinked at the abrupt change of topic.“No,” I said.“Was thinking we could ride tomorrow, take in the sights?” Rock suggested, and I beamed at him. Then my face fell.“I have to start working again soon,” I said.“Lindsey has put you back on the books already, honey. You’re on sick leave.” Rock grinned at me as a waitress cleared our plates, and Bernard hurried over with dessert. My eyes widened greedily at the plate of mini cheesecakes, two of each.“I think I just made room for dessert,” I giggled, and Rock grinned.“Babe, you always had a sweet tooth,” Rock teased.“Can’t deny that.” I smiled and scooped a bite of a chocolate cheesecake. I moaned in pure bliss, and Rock chuckled again.“So ride tomorrow?” Rock asked around bites.“Well, I shouldn’t let Lindsey pay me sick pay when I can work tomorrow,” I demurred, and Rock scowled.“Carly, you’re not going back to work until you put on at least twenty-four pounds. Girl, you look like a strong wind will blow you over. Lindsey’s in agreement. While she and Silvie are desperate to have you back, you’ve been through hell and need to fuckin’ heal a little. Lindsey said if you set foot over the shop’s threshold before a month’s over, she’ll fire you,” Rock grinned smugly, and I rolled my eyes.“Seriously? And what am I meant to do for money? My savings are just that, savings. I don’t want to break into them,” I muttered without heat.“What ya need money for?” Rock asked curiously as he scooped another bite of cheesecake.“Well, things, women’s things, clothes, food, somewhere to live,” I said, puzzled.“Let’s get this straight now; you keep missing the point, Carly,” Rock said sternly, and I glanced up, surprised at his tone. “If you want anything, I’ll buy it; you need to go to the shops for lady shit, you take my card, want to buy clothing, you take my card. As for a house, I got a place we can live, ain’t anything as grand as the others but I think you’ll like it. Needs furnishing, though, so you’ll….”“Take your card,” I interrupted. Rock offered a nod as I shook my head.“Please meet me halfway. Rock, I am not and never have been someone who lives off another person’s wallet. I work to afford nice things and had goals. But I won’t live off of you, Rock; I have pride,” I said. Rock grimaced.“Every woman has this argument, and I feel for my brothers now. Except for Drake, his wife is so fuckin’ rich, Drake has little choice,” Rock complained. I hid a smirk; Rock wasn’t wrong on that. “Look, I get you want to work, that’s admirable, but understand me as well. I ain’t a sissified wimp of a man; I’m a man who claims a woman and looks after her. So you keep your money for girlie shit but agree to say once a month you take my card and go apeshit on it. I pay bills and everything else, and your money buys your clothes and shit, can we agree?” Rock grumbled, sounding peeved. These men hated being told no.“Yes, we can agree on that,” I said happily, pleased I didn’t have to battle Rock for what he thought was his rights. Rock sent me a sly glance.“As we’re on our one agreed to blow it on my card day, let’s go shoe shopping because those dainty little feet of yours won’t put on weight,” Rock said, smirking. My nose twitched, and I knew he had me bang to rights, and I’d just walked straight into his trap. Smugly Rock paid the bill and led me from the restaurant.◆◆◆ “Bitch! I hate you, I need new shoes,” Lindsey cursed as she held up the blue velvet Jimmy Choo’s Rock had bought me.“Wowie!” Phoe squealed and hurried across. “Hot damn, Rock must have dropped a wad on these!” Phoe exclaimed.“Why can’t you be my shoe size?” Silvie whined, holding up a pair of gold strappy high-heeled sandals and glowering at me. I shrugged as she gazed at Apache, who was watching her, and he winced.“You can’t have the same shoes as Carly, or you’ll bitch,” Apache warned and turned his back. Silvie flipped him the finger and cooed at the matching bag for the sandals.“I need to go shopping,” Lindsey whined, gazing at Lowrider. Lowrider gazed calmly back.“Woman, how much did you drop on those shoes yesterday?” Lowrider asked.“Not a lot,” Lindsey muttered. Lowrider lifted an eyebrow, and Lindsey pursed her lips. “Okay, I dropped three thousand on them,” she muttered.“And the other pair?” Lowrider asked.“Three thousand again,” Lindsey said mulishly, and I was grinning outright.“What’s your monthly budget for shoes?” Lowrider asked, and I caught Apache smothering a smile.“Five thousand.” Lindsey made eyes at Lowrider.“So stop your bitching about needing more shoes. I ain’t making you take a thousand off next month’s budget… yet,” Lowrider said and turned back to his beer. Lindsey paled at the thought of her beloved shoe budget being downsized and poked her tongue out at Lowrider. Phoe and I cried with laughter.“What if Lindsey gets shoes as a gift?” Phoe called, and Lowrider turned and sent Phoe a stern glance. Phoe was well known to love to spoil people, and I saw Lowrider click onto her meaning.“Do I need to talk to Drake about your budget?” Lowrider asked, and Phoe shrugged.“Bleh, as if Drake would stop me. All I got to do is walk naked into our bedroom wearing a pair of heels, and Drake won’t argue.” Phoe grinned. Lowrider groaned and rubbed his forehead.“Fuck Phoe, I don’t need that image!” Lowrider cursed and turned his back. Drake broke out laughing, and Phoe grinned triumphantly. I liked pretty shoes but didn’t understand the need to hoard them like the others did. Lindsey, Phoe, and Silvie boasted a closet just for their shoes.“Holy shit, I need a pair like this. Did they do them in other colours?” Marsha exclaimed, holding up a pair of satin peep-toes.“Yes,” I said.“Fish!” Marsha roared, and I saw Fish roll his eyes.“Tomorrow, baby, Windfell may need to stock up after our girl cleared them out,” Fish called back.“See, Fish doesn’t set Marsha a limit,” Lindsey complained, making doe eyes at Lowrider.“Marsha don’t want a new pair of shoes every day,” Lowrider retorted, and Lindsey gave up arguing. Each old lady shopped at Windfells frequently. The shop was privately owned and was prominently placed in downtown Rapid City. When staff spied the old ladies coming, they knew they were onto a fantastic day, not just in sales but tips too. Their eyes had burst out of their head as Rock had dropped enough money to feed an army for a year.“Did Rock clear them out of everything?” Sin asked, strolling across her eyes wide. She gazed at the mass of boxes piled around us.“Enough that he had to call Klutz for a meet to collect them,” I said, laughing. Klutz had been good-natured about using his truck to ship my shoes back. I’d have been happy with one or two pairs, but Rock thought shoes linked to kinky sex. And after he told me that in an aside, I stopped arguing. Mainly because I had the image of Rock hot and sweaty, and kinky sex meant good things.“You look happy baby, those shadows in your eyes have gone,” Marsha said, peering into my face. She came in close, and I fought the urge to poke her in the eye. I hated people in my face.“Rock,” I said, and that one word explained it all. I stole a glance at him, legs splayed, sitting on a stool with a beer in hand. He was leaning forward, talking to Slick, who was nodding and motioning with his hands. A warmth settled in my belly, and I recognised it for what it was, love, acceptance and comfort, the sense and feeling of home.“Rock was foul, you know, these last six months,” Phoe said, nodding at Rock. Turning to her, I frowned.“He was?” I asked, and Silvie nodded vigorously.“Rock was awful, he’s never been verbose, but he became mute and downright snarly. It started the day you left.” Lindsey looked uncomfortable. “Rock had been watching you and was waiting for you to grow into your skin, and then he planned to make a move. That kiss you gave him and the scene that followed after in Made by Rage, Rock knew it was time to lay claim. Then you up and disappeared… shush, I know you didn’t plan to, girl.” Lindsey cut off what I was going to say.“Sorry,” I muttered.“We know what you did for us Carly, but we didn’t expect you to sacrifice yourself. None of us had a clue why you ran and we were all hurt. Carly, don’t you ever sacrifice yourself like that again,” Phoe scolded.“My brothers made it seem there wasn’t a choice,” I said and glanced away. Lindsey picked up on my awkwardness.“Rock saw his chance at getting everything he wanted, and then your asshole brothers snatched it from him. He was nasty, his darkness welled up and shit; I thought we were going to lose him like they lost Ace. Rock became monotone and evil, ready for a fight at the slightest insult, and there was a good few fights. That man was a walking hair-trigger temper,” Lindsey said.“Drake couldn’t reach him, and nor could Lex, and that was worrying because Rock and Lex are close. Lex tried, but Rock shut him down every time. He’d arrive at work with Apache, do his shifts here and hang around, but Rock wasn’t present,” Phoe said, and I heard the worry in her voice.“Yeah, Rock shut down; I think he thought he wasn’t entitled to beauty,” Silvie agreed. Guilt welled up, and I swallowed it back. That had been my fault. Rock hadn’t thought he was worthy when, in fact, it was me who wasn’t worthy of the man. I was nothing but trailer trash, and it was hard to understand why Rock wanted me.“Rock’s always been one of the silent brothers, solid and dependable. Guess he saw his dreams disappearing down the plughole and shut down,” Marsha said. “Which goes to show just how much Rock cares about you, girl.”“I’ve guessed that. Rock wants nothing more than to smother me in cotton wool and keep me by his side,” I said. Drake’s phone pinged, and moments later, he rose to his feet, Rock, Apache, Klutz and Slick behind him.“Stay inside,” Drake ordered, and we nodded. Moments later, Ellen hurried in, looking flustered with Texas’s daughter Rosie and Axel’s daughter Willow behind her.“I am FBI,” Willow was declaring loudly and looking mad.“Drake says get your ass inside, you get your ass inside,” Ellen said firmly and crossed her arms, glancing at the two young women. Axel’s woman wasn’t going to be moved, I noted. I’d only met Ellen once and wasn’t sure of the older woman. Lindsey and Silvie had been full of glee when they told me Axel had found his one, and Ellen seemed like a nice lady. She certainly held her own against the enormous mountain of a man by all reports.“Drake is not FBI,” Willow said mulishly. Phoe rolled her eyes.“Nope, but he’s your uncle, and you’ll do as you’re told!” Phoe said, and Willow frowned.“Don’t even think of arguing,” Marsha said, backing Phoe.“Christ, you can’t wrap me up in cotton wool forever!” Willow said and stormed across the room to the bar. Oh, I knew that feeling; I sympathised with the pretty woman who was glowering at the door and fingering the weapon she had strapped to her waist. From what I’d learned, Willow was fully capable of looking after herself after being undercover for many years. A cover so good that Axel had written Willow off as a lost cause.“Shopping Ellen?” Marsha asked as Ellen strolled across to us.“Yes, I thought I’d treat the girls to a manicure and pedicure day. Nailing Willow’s feet to the floor long enough to do so is a miracle. And even then, she wouldn’t leave her badge and weapon behind,” Ellen sighed and sank into an armchair. Willow sent Ellen a smug look.“Well, Willow was always more business than girlie girl,” Marsha agreed, and I smirked. Marsha waggled a finger at me; I liked the sound of Willow.“You’re just as bad, Carly; you can’t sit still,” Lindsey teased, and I nodded happily. Seriously, how boring was it to sit in a chair while people touched your feet? Urgh, no!“You will learn to enjoy them,” Silvie threatened, and I rolled my eyes at her.“What’s going on, anyway?” Sin asked as she slipped her shoes off and wriggled her toes.“You know Blaze keeps feeling watched? Autumn saw that guy once, but every so often, Blaze gets the feeling again?” Everyone nodded at Rosie as she sat. “I caught sight of a bike parked behind a truck, and his visor was firmly focused in Blake’s direction on the forecourt. So I texted Uncle Drake, and we got thrown in here.” Rosie sighed as Willow frowned.“How long has Blaze been sensing that?” Willow asked, scooting closer.“Not frequently, but for over a year now, Willow. Whoever it is, just watches. They haven’t approached Blaze or anything, so it’s strange. Blaze has no idea who it is, but it bothers him,” I said and jumped as bike pipes roared loudly, and I heard at least three bikes speed away. Drake entered with Calamity on his heels, who walked behind the bar and took over from where Klutz had been serving. Calamity leaned back against the wall behind the bar and gazed at Rosie, and sent her a wink. Marsha’s mouth dropped open as her gaze flicked between the two of them. Rosie poked her tongue out, and I shook my head as Calamity sent her a badass biker look.“Don’t you dare go there without your father’s approval,” Marsha warned, and Rosie scowled.“Dad doesn’t run my life; I run his!” Rosie muttered.“Your father will string Calamity up by his balls should he make a move on you without permission. It’s sacrilege to even consider making a move on a brother’s daughter without their fathers’ permission!” Silvie warned Rosie.“It’s just fun, we’re flirting, but I have to finish university first. I’ve a year left, and then I’m a qualified vet. Ain’t going to let nothing stand in the way of that Aunt Silvie,” Rosie demurred, but I saw the heat in the following glance she sent Calamity.“Oh boy,” Sin muttered. From the looks I saw on the other women’s faces, oh boy, was right. Texas was well known to be an overprotective father, and Rosie had been one of Rage’s few children. So she’d been overindulged and loved her entire life. And smothered… the brothers had been overly protective of Rosie, and she hadn’t been able to break free of their shackles until she went away to college. Even then, Texas tried to keep Rosie local, but she broke free and wandered off to attend university.“Get Penny on your side,” I muttered to Rosie, who grinned.“Not a bad idea,” Rosie muttered back. “Calamity’s still filling out, but you can see the brother he’s going to be.” Rosie was right, Calamity when he’d first arrived, had been a scrawny kid, the same age as me near enough and had been mistreated his entire life. Calamity got neck deep into trouble and came seeking a home and found Rage. The prospect had been taken on as a candidate, which progressed to prospect earlier than expected when he’d saved Silvie’s life from a serial killer.Calamity was taller than when he arrived, hitting six foot three now. He’d gained weight and muscle and was a good-looking man. Calamity was the cheerful one, nothing fazed him, and he’d a ready smile and cheerful manner. He was at odds with most of the brothers, who preferred stern and blank expressions. Even though he was rabidly friendly, Calamity was pretty close to Klutz, and they often sat chin-wagging in a corner.“They’re voting tonight,” Phoe said suddenly, and we glanced at her. “I heard Drake on the phone.“Huh?” Marsha asked.“On the candidates, so if anyone has any qualms about them, you better speak up, and I’ll drop a word in Drake’s ear,” Phoe said, looking around the gaggle of old ladies.“None here,” Sin said, relaxing back. Silvie moaned and rubbed her protruding stomach.“How much longer?” I asked. Silvie glowered and poked at her stomach.“Five weeks. These kids are in a damn hurry to escape,” she muttered.“I can’t believe Jett knocked me up again so quickly,” Sin groused, but her eyes belayed her happiness. And speak of the devil. Jett walked in carrying their two little girls, Amelia and Brooke. Amelia was on her feet and heading towards Uncle Drake before anyone could blink. Amelia completely loved Drake and him, her. Well, Drake loved all the kids. Drake swooped and swept Amelia up, tickling her under her chin as Jett made his way to Sin. Shit, that man was gorgeous, not as much as Rock but Jett had it going on.“Who else is pregnant?” I asked as Jett handed Brooke over to Sin for a feed. Sin pulled a blanket around her, and Brooke and I glanced away, giving them privacy. Drake had told me, but I wondered if any of the old ladies were keeping secrets.“Marsha three months, Artemis two months with one child this time, thank god, she’d have ripped Ace’s dick off if they had a third set of twins,” Phoe said, and I chuckled. Artemis was fully capable of doing so. “Autumn’s six months pregnant, with twins.”“Damn, how many sets of twins?” I gasped, and Phoe shrugged.“Given up counting, guess when you have Ace and Apache around, and Autumn, who have the genetics for twins, then we’re going to be drowned in them,” she replied.“How on earth did they get knocked up so quickly after their last pregnancies?” I asked, pointing at Marsha and Sin.“Think you know the answer to that,” Marsha hissed, and I blushed.“Wait till Rock gets it in his head he wants babies, see how long you keep your birth control pills for,” Sin said and pursed her lips. I laughed. Sin and Jett’s ongoing battle over her birth control pills had been hysterical.“And Fish says now we’re making babies, we gonna keep making them,” Marsha groused. “He don’t know three is all he’s getting; I’m getting on in age.”“Thirty-eight isn’t old; you keep giving me grandbabies; that’s your duty,” Ellen teased Marsha, whose mouth dropped open.“Seriously, you’re giving me shit? Adopt some of your own!” Marsha hit back, and Ellen threw her head back and laughed.“No way. Axel and I get to return them at the end of the day. Ain’t so stupid to tie ourselves down,” she said.“So you make the rest of us your baby-making machines?” I asked, and Ellen turned an innocent gaze on me.“Why Carly, of course!” she said, and Phoe laughed hysterically.“That’s funny shit!” Silvie said and patted her stomach as one twin kicked her hard. Yeah, it was funny shit, but the humour faded when I considered having Rock’s kids. Cute little boys that looked like their father. Oh yeah, that would be something.",

      "content": "Chapter Three.I felt far better when we left the hair salon. My hair was now a sleek, pretty coloured bob, and I kept pulling the coloured strands forward to look at them. I don’t know what I’d expected, but the three colours were interwoven with each other, making it a rainbow in my hair. And I loved the effect, and Rock realised that and smiled smugly. Rock stopped me in the middle of the street and took a photo so I could see. Not as much fun as pulling the strands forward, but I appreciated the thought.“Carly, I miss your long hair,” Rock said, taking a strand and letting it slip through his fingers.“Then I’ll grow it back just for you,” I murmured, looking across at the clothing shops Rock had stopped nearby. These were high-end shops, and while I didn’t doubt they’d have clothes to fit me, I wasn’t a high maintenance girl.“Yeah, you do that, baby,” Rock said.“Look, can’t we go to Target or Walmart? I just need a few basics Rock, I’ll be gaining weight hopefully soon, so these clothes won’t last long,” I said, not wanting to enter the high priced shops.“True, but I want you to have a few pretty dresses, so when I take you out, you feel good,” Rock said, gazing into my eyes earnestly. Damn, how could anyone say no to those beautiful, begging eyes without being a wicked bitch? Humour and smugness glinted in Rock’s eyes, and I knew I’d been played.“Fine,” I huffed, but without any strength behind it.“Carly, will you be okay for a few minutes? I just need to pick something up, and I won’t be more than five minutes,” Rock asked, and I hesitated. No, I didn’t want to be alone. Fear of my brothers threatened to overwhelm me. Shivers ran down my spine, and goosebumps rose on my arms. Rock noticed immediately and sought to soothe me by stroking my back gently.“Yeah,” I muttered, and Rock shook his head.“Nah, I’ll walk you over and see you safely inside, and then run my task. Honest Carly, I won’t leave you for more than a few minutes. Find several dresses; I rarely saw your pretty legs and want to see them on our dates,” Rock said, and I wondered if I should swoon. Rock wanted to date me, court me. He wasn’t going in gung-ho like the other brothers. Maybe Rock realised I’d be frightened of that, as I’d been dominated far too long.Yeah, I wasn’t the only one who’d been assaulted or hurt. Phoe, Lindsey, and Sin had, too. Silvie had been badly injured when she’d been run over by a rival gang. At first, I thought my brothers had been behind Silvie being hurt and was so relieved they hadn’t been. The guilt of my best friend being run over because of me was more than I could have handled.The difference between Phoe, Sin, Silvie and me was, they’d had time to get over their abuse, or it happened when in their relationship. Which meant their men went out of the way to protect them while I’d dealt with the abuse alone.Lindsey had been in the middle of an abusive marriage when she’d fled to Rage. And while I’d come to her battles late, I’d seen first-hand how Lindsey had put herself back together and how Lowrider had supported her. With Rock’s support, I’d recover so I wouldn’t be afraid of my shadow. Rock squeezed my shoulder as we reached the shop entrance, and I gazed with trepidation at the posh interior.“A few minutes Carly, that’s it,” Rock said, and I nodded. Rock dropped a brief kiss on my lips to bolster my courage, and I watched as his long legs strode away. Cautiously, I pushed open the door and entered. Yeah, this was a lovely shop, with clean lines and eye-catching displays. The clothes were expensive and of high quality. Quietly, I began browsing, keeping my head low as I searched for dresses that would make Rock’s eyes pop. I found three in the first few minutes and checked for their smallest size, which I thought may still be too big for me. I saw two snooty saleswomen by a desk and moved closer, intending to ask where changing rooms were.“Like she can afford to buy anything here,” one girl sneered, her back to me. Her colleague was facing her and sneered, not seeing me behind a rack of clothing.“I’ll flip you for it; I don’t want to serve her either. Waste of time. She looks like she just escaped from a Nazi prison camp.” The second girl giggled, and I winced as the barb hit home. Tears filled my eyes. Even with my new haircut, I was still a mess. I looked at the three dresses and my hands clenched. Pretty clothing wouldn’t hide the ugliness.“Deal, loser gets to serve that, as I got better things to do with my time than wait on her. Why on earth does she think she can afford anything in here, doesn’t our shop scream couture and money? She’s more Target than couture.” My head sank to my chest. The girl was correct. My shame deepened as I heard them flip, and one of them cry out at losing. They began a battle over best out of three, and I stepped back into an extremely large, angrily vibrating body. Rock’s arms clamped around me, and I twisted and buried my head in Rock’s chest.“Oh,” one girl said, sounding stunned.“Where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock thundered, and I clung tighter to him.“What?” girl one asked, sounding stunned and a little afraid.“Said, where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock repeated as his hand stroked my back, at odds with his aggressive tone.“Hello, I’m here, can I help?” a woman said, hurrying over. I felt the heat of Rock’s glower, even though I couldn’t see it.“Your two cunts here just got your shop blacklisted. My girl came here to get a few dresses, and those two bitches were tearing her apart, saying she couldn’t afford to shop here. How the fuck do they know who my girl is? And then the bitches they are likened my woman to a prisoner in a concentration camp,” Rock said furiously.“Rock,” I whispered, and his hand pushed me into his chest harder.“I… I… don’t use language like that in my shop, sir. I can apologise for my salesgirls….”“No fuckin’ buts. Know who I am? Who I belong to? Yeah, and when Rage blacklists a business, it goes under damn quick. Rage just blacklisted you. And FYI bitches, my girl was kidnapped and held hostage for six months. Maybe Rage ought to teach you a lesson on how to look good when you’ve been held for six months,” Rock threatened, and the girls paled. One began crying as Rock took the three dresses from my hand and threw them on the floor. Growling unhappily, Rock pulled his phone from his back pocket and dialled a number.“Phoenix put the word out, A Touch of Class is blacklisted, just insulted Carly,” Rock growled. Phoe replied, and Rock said that I was okay. He hung up, holding the eyes of the manager and called Drake and repeated his message.“Next time before you bitches open your mouth, don’t fuckin’ judge a person,” Rock told them and escorted me out of the shop. The manager began yelling at the girls as we left, and Rock steered me away.“Are you going to blacklist that shop?” I asked as Rock steered me towards another shop.“Fuck yeah, and tonight those two bitches are gonna get the fright of their spoiled bitch life,” Rock said.“Rock, they learned their lesson,” I said placatingly.“Don’t give a fuck,” Rock answered back, and I let it drop. I recognised that tone. I’d heard it in most brothers when they’d made their minds up. “Phoe recommended this shop; it’s new and just opened,” Rock said and opened the door, guiding me inside it. A cheerful, beautifully dressed salesgirl came rushing over, smiling at us.“Hello, welcome to Maddison’s Magic. Can I just say, I love your hair!” she said, beaming at me.“Thank you,” I said, her words a balm to my wounded ego.“How may I help you?”“My girl needs jeans, leggings, and tops. And at least three nice dresses suitable for fine dining. Actually, make that five,” Rock mused with a frown. “She doesn’t want too much, Carly’s been through some shit and lost weight, but she’s putting it back on slowly. So treat her right, and we’ll return when she needs more clothes,” Rock warned, and the girl grinned.“I’m Maddy, the Maddison on the sign, and I don’t need to be warned to treat a customer correctly. Now sweetie, let’s find you some clothing that will expand for a couple of sizes as you gain weight. Then you get more wear out of them,” Maddy said, smiling. I liked this cheerful girl and her positive attitude. Maddy took me to a sofa, and I sat as she rummaged through her racks and brought me clothing. Happily, Maddy encouraged me to try on leggings and jeans, tutting when she thought something looked wrong and grinning when she thought it was perfect.To my surprise, Rock seemed perfectly at ease being in a dress shop, watching me try clothing on, and modelling it for him. I’d have been happy with a trip to Target. Rock sat in a chair and played with his phone, glancing up as I exited the changing room. Maddy jumped in before Rock did, agreeing or disagreeing with the clothing I was modelling. After two hours, I finally called quits. I was too tired to continue, and I wanted food and rest. Maddy cheerfully chatted to Rock, not put off by his grunts as she bagged up my purchases and then offered a five percent discount.I’ll give Maddy her due. She was a canny businesswoman. By offering Rock five percent, she guaranteed he’d bring me back. Rock had insisted I wear a pretty yellow dress he’d picked, and I’d a cardigan over it. He glanced outside and realised I needed a coat, and Maddy sprang into action, picking three for me. Rock paid for them and slipped the first over my arms like a gentleman would. It was a lovely camel colour in thick-lined wool, falling to my knees and with a wide tanned leather belt. Rock also picked up a hat, scarf, and gloves and paid for them at the same time. Once again, Maddy offered the discount.Rock led me to his Dodge Charger, threw the bags inside the trunk, and asked where I wanted to eat. To be honest, I didn’t care; I needed food as my stomach was cramping painfully. I’d be happy grabbing something at the Reading Nook. Instead, Rock drove to Bernard’s restaurant and parked at the back. As we got out, I realised I still wore my shoddy sneakers and stopped walking.“Baby?” Rock asked, seeing the concern on my face.“Rock my shoes,” I whispered. Rock dropped his gaze to my feet and stepped forward, and wrapped an arm around me tightly.“Let anyone dare comment, baby,” Rock said, trying to reassure me. Without a further argument, he steered me into Bernard’s and the man himself came hurrying towards us. After effusive greetings, Bernard led us to a cosy table in the corner. Rock took the chair next to the wall so he could see what was coming, and I appreciated it. Bernard offered us his special of the day, to which Rock agreed, and I sat there squirming. There was no doubt Bernard’s was fine dining. The people surrounding us confirmed that, as did the décor. But Bernard himself was down to earth and friendly.Of course, I’d met him several times when he’d come to the clubhouse with his husband, Stefan, who was a close friend of Phoe. But dining in his restaurant was an entirely different matter. This was the man’s business, and he intended to spoil us, judging by his reaction. Bernard brought our drinks and appetisers, and I tucked in straight away. Rock had ordered a variety of tapas. I could have inhaled them; I was so hungry.“So, what do you fancy doing next? Shall we go shoe shopping?” Rock asked.“Yeah, I need some as, unfortunately, my sneakers don’t go with the dresses. Perhaps a pair of new sneakers and a nice pair of shoes for the dress?” I suggested, and Rock took on a mulish look before nodding. He’d agreed too quickly, and I was suspicious. As a waitress cleared away our plates, Rock reached into his cut pocket and withdrew several jewellery boxes. I gazed at the four boxes as Rock pushed them in front of me.“What are they?” I asked.“Ordered them the day after you returned, and I knew the truth,” Rock grunted. He nudged one towards me with a long finger, and I picked it up. Excited, I untied the ribbon and flicked the lid open and made an O with my mouth. Inside was a gold chain with an oval-shaped pendant containing a diamond.“How pretty,” I said, gazing at it. Rock rose to his feet, reached for the box, took the necklace out, and fastened it around my neck. He dropped a kiss on my neck and sat back down, and shoved a second box at me. Cheekily smiling, I opened it and discovered a matching bracelet. The third box held matching earrings, and the fourth an anklet.“Didn’t get you a ring because I know it interferes with your work. Lindsey is always bitching her rings have caught on something,” Rock said.“I didn’t expect these,” I said, smiling happily. I loved presents, presents felt better than Rock buying me clothes because I was needy.“Carly, you expect nothing,” Rock teased. Bernard approached with our mains. Rock had ordered the surf and turf platter, which with Bernard’s flourish meant two T-Bone steaks, lobster in a shell, crab, and king prawns. Added to that feast was calamari with a 16 oz gammon steak, ribs and a butterfly chicken breast. There was a large basket of fries and another containing garlic bread, and a third with garlic breaded mushrooms. A waitress brought dipping sauces. My eyes widened in horror at the amount of food, and Bernard laughed.“Enjoy!” Bernard chortled and disappeared.“Where do we start?” I asked, lost in the aromas floating from the platter. Rock pulled two plates towards him, cut the chicken breast in half, and did the same with the ribs and steak. Next, he added fries and sides and shoved a plate towards me.“Are you claiming the lobster?” I teased, and Rock winked. He cracked the shell open and scooped a forkful of the meat out, and held it out to me. I leaned forward and went to take the fork, and Rock moved it away. Then, with a wicked glint in his eyes, Rock offered the fork again, and this time when I leant forward, Rock placed the fork in my mouth. My eyes watered in pleasure. The lobster was succulent and delicious. Wow, Bernard could undoubtedly cook! As we ate, we chatted about Rock’s work and halfway through, I sat back and rubbed my stomach.“Damn, I’m full,” I muttered. Rock glanced at me dubiously, so I nodded to confirm my words. “Please finish; it would be a shame to waste the food; it was so wonderful.” Rock didn’t need telling twice, and finally, the platters were clean, and Rock sat back with a satisfied grunt. He patted his belly and grinned at me.“That’s earned you an extra half an hour at the gym,” I teased, and Rock chuckled.“Fuckin’ worth it, princess, man I could eat here every day,” Rock said.“The food was amazing; it’s the first time I’ve ever eaten here,” I said, and Rock nodded.“Rapid City got some great restaurants, but Bernard’s is most definitely the best. Hate to be one of those fuckers who have to book or take a risk on getting a table, love the fact we can get a table whenever we want. Change of subject, Carly, you ever been to Mount Rushmore?” I blinked at the abrupt change of topic.“No,” I said.“Was thinking we could ride tomorrow, take in the sights?” Rock suggested, and I beamed at him. Then my face fell.“I have to start working again soon,” I said.“Lindsey has put you back on the books already, honey. You’re on sick leave.” Rock grinned at me as a waitress cleared our plates, and Bernard hurried over with dessert. My eyes widened greedily at the plate of mini cheesecakes, two of each.“I think I just made room for dessert,” I giggled, and Rock grinned.“Babe, you always had a sweet tooth,” Rock teased.“Can’t deny that.” I smiled and scooped a bite of a chocolate cheesecake. I moaned in pure bliss, and Rock chuckled again.“So ride tomorrow?” Rock asked around bites.“Well, I shouldn’t let Lindsey pay me sick pay when I can work tomorrow,” I demurred, and Rock scowled.“Carly, you’re not going back to work until you put on at least twenty-four pounds. Girl, you look like a strong wind will blow you over. Lindsey’s in agreement. While she and Silvie are desperate to have you back, you’ve been through hell and need to fuckin’ heal a little. Lindsey said if you set foot over the shop’s threshold before a month’s over, she’ll fire you,” Rock grinned smugly, and I rolled my eyes.“Seriously? And what am I meant to do for money? My savings are just that, savings. I don’t want to break into them,” I muttered without heat.“What ya need money for?” Rock asked curiously as he scooped another bite of cheesecake.“Well, things, women’s things, clothes, food, somewhere to live,” I said, puzzled.“Let’s get this straight now; you keep missing the point, Carly,” Rock said sternly, and I glanced up, surprised at his tone. “If you want anything, I’ll buy it; you need to go to the shops for lady shit, you take my card, want to buy clothing, you take my card. As for a house, I got a place we can live, ain’t anything as grand as the others but I think you’ll like it. Needs furnishing, though, so you’ll….”“Take your card,” I interrupted. Rock offered a nod as I shook my head.“Please meet me halfway. Rock, I am not and never have been someone who lives off another person’s wallet. I work to afford nice things and had goals. But I won’t live off of you, Rock; I have pride,” I said. Rock grimaced.“Every woman has this argument, and I feel for my brothers now. Except for Drake, his wife is so fuckin’ rich, Drake has little choice,” Rock complained. I hid a smirk; Rock wasn’t wrong on that. “Look, I get you want to work, that’s admirable, but understand me as well. I ain’t a sissified wimp of a man; I’m a man who claims a woman and looks after her. So you keep your money for girlie shit but agree to say once a month you take my card and go apeshit on it. I pay bills and everything else, and your money buys your clothes and shit, can we agree?” Rock grumbled, sounding peeved. These men hated being told no.“Yes, we can agree on that,” I said happily, pleased I didn’t have to battle Rock for what he thought was his rights. Rock sent me a sly glance.“As we’re on our one agreed to blow it on my card day, let’s go shoe shopping because those dainty little feet of yours won’t put on weight,” Rock said, smirking. My nose twitched, and I knew he had me bang to rights, and I’d just walked straight into his trap. Smugly Rock paid the bill and led me from the restaurant.◆◆◆ “Bitch! I hate you, I need new shoes,” Lindsey cursed as she held up the blue velvet Jimmy Choo’s Rock had bought me.“Wowie!” Phoe squealed and hurried across. “Hot damn, Rock must have dropped a wad on these!” Phoe exclaimed.“Why can’t you be my shoe size?” Silvie whined, holding up a pair of gold strappy high-heeled sandals and glowering at me. I shrugged as she gazed at Apache, who was watching her, and he winced.“You can’t have the same shoes as Carly, or you’ll bitch,” Apache warned and turned his back. Silvie flipped him the finger and cooed at the matching bag for the sandals.“I need to go shopping,” Lindsey whined, gazing at Lowrider. Lowrider gazed calmly back.“Woman, how much did you drop on those shoes yesterday?” Lowrider asked.“Not a lot,” Lindsey muttered. Lowrider lifted an eyebrow, and Lindsey pursed her lips. “Okay, I dropped three thousand on them,” she muttered.“And the other pair?” Lowrider asked.“Three thousand again,” Lindsey said mulishly, and I was grinning outright.“What’s your monthly budget for shoes?” Lowrider asked, and I caught Apache smothering a smile.“Five thousand.” Lindsey made eyes at Lowrider.“So stop your bitching about needing more shoes. I ain’t making you take a thousand off next month’s budget… yet,” Lowrider said and turned back to his beer. Lindsey paled at the thought of her beloved shoe budget being downsized and poked her tongue out at Lowrider. Phoe and I cried with laughter.“What if Lindsey gets shoes as a gift?” Phoe called, and Lowrider turned and sent Phoe a stern glance. Phoe was well known to love to spoil people, and I saw Lowrider click onto her meaning.“Do I need to talk to Drake about your budget?” Lowrider asked, and Phoe shrugged.“Bleh, as if Drake would stop me. All I got to do is walk naked into our bedroom wearing a pair of heels, and Drake won’t argue.” Phoe grinned. Lowrider groaned and rubbed his forehead.“Fuck Phoe, I don’t need that image!” Lowrider cursed and turned his back. Drake broke out laughing, and Phoe grinned triumphantly. I liked pretty shoes but didn’t understand the need to hoard them like the others did. Lindsey, Phoe, and Silvie boasted a closet just for their shoes.“Holy shit, I need a pair like this. Did they do them in other colours?” Marsha exclaimed, holding up a pair of satin peep-toes.“Yes,” I said.“Fish!” Marsha roared, and I saw Fish roll his eyes.“Tomorrow, baby, Windfell may need to stock up after our girl cleared them out,” Fish called back.“See, Fish doesn’t set Marsha a limit,” Lindsey complained, making doe eyes at Lowrider.“Marsha don’t want a new pair of shoes every day,” Lowrider retorted, and Lindsey gave up arguing. Each old lady shopped at Windfells frequently. The shop was privately owned and was prominently placed in downtown Rapid City. When staff spied the old ladies coming, they knew they were onto a fantastic day, not just in sales but tips too. Their eyes had burst out of their head as Rock had dropped enough money to feed an army for a year.“Did Rock clear them out of everything?” Sin asked, strolling across her eyes wide. She gazed at the mass of boxes piled around us.“Enough that he had to call Klutz for a meet to collect them,” I said, laughing. Klutz had been good-natured about using his truck to ship my shoes back. I’d have been happy with one or two pairs, but Rock thought shoes linked to kinky sex. And after he told me that in an aside, I stopped arguing. Mainly because I had the image of Rock hot and sweaty, and kinky sex meant good things.“You look happy baby, those shadows in your eyes have gone,” Marsha said, peering into my face. She came in close, and I fought the urge to poke her in the eye. I hated people in my face.“Rock,” I said, and that one word explained it all. I stole a glance at him, legs splayed, sitting on a stool with a beer in hand. He was leaning forward, talking to Slick, who was nodding and motioning with his hands. A warmth settled in my belly, and I recognised it for what it was, love, acceptance and comfort, the sense and feeling of home.“Rock was foul, you know, these last six months,” Phoe said, nodding at Rock. Turning to her, I frowned.“He was?” I asked, and Silvie nodded vigorously.“Rock was awful, he’s never been verbose, but he became mute and downright snarly. It started the day you left.” Lindsey looked uncomfortable. “Rock had been watching you and was waiting for you to grow into your skin, and then he planned to make a move. That kiss you gave him and the scene that followed after in Made by Rage, Rock knew it was time to lay claim. Then you up and disappeared… shush, I know you didn’t plan to, girl.” Lindsey cut off what I was going to say.“Sorry,” I muttered.“We know what you did for us Carly, but we didn’t expect you to sacrifice yourself. None of us had a clue why you ran and we were all hurt. Carly, don’t you ever sacrifice yourself like that again,” Phoe scolded.“My brothers made it seem there wasn’t a choice,” I said and glanced away. Lindsey picked up on my awkwardness.“Rock saw his chance at getting everything he wanted, and then your asshole brothers snatched it from him. He was nasty, his darkness welled up and shit; I thought we were going to lose him like they lost Ace. Rock became monotone and evil, ready for a fight at the slightest insult, and there was a good few fights. That man was a walking hair-trigger temper,” Lindsey said.“Drake couldn’t reach him, and nor could Lex, and that was worrying because Rock and Lex are close. Lex tried, but Rock shut him down every time. He’d arrive at work with Apache, do his shifts here and hang around, but Rock wasn’t present,” Phoe said, and I heard the worry in her voice.“Yeah, Rock shut down; I think he thought he wasn’t entitled to beauty,” Silvie agreed. Guilt welled up, and I swallowed it back. That had been my fault. Rock hadn’t thought he was worthy when, in fact, it was me who wasn’t worthy of the man. I was nothing but trailer trash, and it was hard to understand why Rock wanted me.“Rock’s always been one of the silent brothers, solid and dependable. Guess he saw his dreams disappearing down the plughole and shut down,” Marsha said. “Which goes to show just how much Rock cares about you, girl.”“I’ve guessed that. Rock wants nothing more than to smother me in cotton wool and keep me by his side,” I said. Drake’s phone pinged, and moments later, he rose to his feet, Rock, Apache, Klutz and Slick behind him.“Stay inside,” Drake ordered, and we nodded. Moments later, Ellen hurried in, looking flustered with Texas’s daughter Rosie and Axel’s daughter Willow behind her.“I am FBI,” Willow was declaring loudly and looking mad.“Drake says get your ass inside, you get your ass inside,” Ellen said firmly and crossed her arms, glancing at the two young women. Axel’s woman wasn’t going to be moved, I noted. I’d only met Ellen once and wasn’t sure of the older woman. Lindsey and Silvie had been full of glee when they told me Axel had found his one, and Ellen seemed like a nice lady. She certainly held her own against the enormous mountain of a man by all reports.“Drake is not FBI,” Willow said mulishly. Phoe rolled her eyes.“Nope, but he’s your uncle, and you’ll do as you’re told!” Phoe said, and Willow frowned.“Don’t even think of arguing,” Marsha said, backing Phoe.“Christ, you can’t wrap me up in cotton wool forever!” Willow said and stormed across the room to the bar. Oh, I knew that feeling; I sympathised with the pretty woman who was glowering at the door and fingering the weapon she had strapped to her waist. From what I’d learned, Willow was fully capable of looking after herself after being undercover for many years. A cover so good that Axel had written Willow off as a lost cause.“Shopping Ellen?” Marsha asked as Ellen strolled across to us.“Yes, I thought I’d treat the girls to a manicure and pedicure day. Nailing Willow’s feet to the floor long enough to do so is a miracle. And even then, she wouldn’t leave her badge and weapon behind,” Ellen sighed and sank into an armchair. Willow sent Ellen a smug look.“Well, Willow was always more business than girlie girl,” Marsha agreed, and I smirked. Marsha waggled a finger at me; I liked the sound of Willow.“You’re just as bad, Carly; you can’t sit still,” Lindsey teased, and I nodded happily. Seriously, how boring was it to sit in a chair while people touched your feet? Urgh, no!“You will learn to enjoy them,” Silvie threatened, and I rolled my eyes at her.“What’s going on, anyway?” Sin asked as she slipped her shoes off and wriggled her toes.“You know Blaze keeps feeling watched? Autumn saw that guy once, but every so often, Blaze gets the feeling again?” Everyone nodded at Rosie as she sat. “I caught sight of a bike parked behind a truck, and his visor was firmly focused in Blake’s direction on the forecourt. So I texted Uncle Drake, and we got thrown in here.” Rosie sighed as Willow frowned.“How long has Blaze been sensing that?” Willow asked, scooting closer.“Not frequently, but for over a year now, Willow. Whoever it is, just watches. They haven’t approached Blaze or anything, so it’s strange. Blaze has no idea who it is, but it bothers him,” I said and jumped as bike pipes roared loudly, and I heard at least three bikes speed away. Drake entered with Calamity on his heels, who walked behind the bar and took over from where Klutz had been serving. Calamity leaned back against the wall behind the bar and gazed at Rosie, and sent her a wink. Marsha’s mouth dropped open as her gaze flicked between the two of them. Rosie poked her tongue out, and I shook my head as Calamity sent her a badass biker look.“Don’t you dare go there without your father’s approval,” Marsha warned, and Rosie scowled.“Dad doesn’t run my life; I run his!” Rosie muttered.“Your father will string Calamity up by his balls should he make a move on you without permission. It’s sacrilege to even consider making a move on a brother’s daughter without their fathers’ permission!” Silvie warned Rosie.“It’s just fun, we’re flirting, but I have to finish university first. I’ve a year left, and then I’m a qualified vet. Ain’t going to let nothing stand in the way of that Aunt Silvie,” Rosie demurred, but I saw the heat in the following glance she sent Calamity.“Oh boy,” Sin muttered. From the looks I saw on the other women’s faces, oh boy, was right. Texas was well known to be an overprotective father, and Rosie had been one of Rage’s few children. So she’d been overindulged and loved her entire life. And smothered… the brothers had been overly protective of Rosie, and she hadn’t been able to break free of their shackles until she went away to college. Even then, Texas tried to keep Rosie local, but she broke free and wandered off to attend university.“Get Penny on your side,” I muttered to Rosie, who grinned.“Not a bad idea,” Rosie muttered back. “Calamity’s still filling out, but you can see the brother he’s going to be.” Rosie was right, Calamity when he’d first arrived, had been a scrawny kid, the same age as me near enough and had been mistreated his entire life. Calamity got neck deep into trouble and came seeking a home and found Rage. The prospect had been taken on as a candidate, which progressed to prospect earlier than expected when he’d saved Silvie’s life from a serial killer.Calamity was taller than when he arrived, hitting six foot three now. He’d gained weight and muscle and was a good-looking man. Calamity was the cheerful one, nothing fazed him, and he’d a ready smile and cheerful manner. He was at odds with most of the brothers, who preferred stern and blank expressions. Even though he was rabidly friendly, Calamity was pretty close to Klutz, and they often sat chin-wagging in a corner.“They’re voting tonight,” Phoe said suddenly, and we glanced at her. “I heard Drake on the phone.“Huh?” Marsha asked.“On the candidates, so if anyone has any qualms about them, you better speak up, and I’ll drop a word in Drake’s ear,” Phoe said, looking around the gaggle of old ladies.“None here,” Sin said, relaxing back. Silvie moaned and rubbed her protruding stomach.“How much longer?” I asked. Silvie glowered and poked at her stomach.“Five weeks. These kids are in a damn hurry to escape,” she muttered.“I can’t believe Jett knocked me up again so quickly,” Sin groused, but her eyes belayed her happiness. And speak of the devil. Jett walked in carrying their two little girls, Amelia and Brooke. Amelia was on her feet and heading towards Uncle Drake before anyone could blink. Amelia completely loved Drake and him, her. Well, Drake loved all the kids. Drake swooped and swept Amelia up, tickling her under her chin as Jett made his way to Sin. Shit, that man was gorgeous, not as much as Rock but Jett had it going on.“Who else is pregnant?” I asked as Jett handed Brooke over to Sin for a feed. Sin pulled a blanket around her, and Brooke and I glanced away, giving them privacy. Drake had told me, but I wondered if any of the old ladies were keeping secrets.“Marsha three months, Artemis two months with one child this time, thank god, she’d have ripped Ace’s dick off if they had a third set of twins,” Phoe said, and I chuckled. Artemis was fully capable of doing so. “Autumn’s six months pregnant, with twins.”“Damn, how many sets of twins?” I gasped, and Phoe shrugged.“Given up counting, guess when you have Ace and Apache around, and Autumn, who have the genetics for twins, then we’re going to be drowned in them,” she replied.“How on earth did they get knocked up so quickly after their last pregnancies?” I asked, pointing at Marsha and Sin.“Think you know the answer to that,” Marsha hissed, and I blushed.“Wait till Rock gets it in his head he wants babies, see how long you keep your birth control pills for,” Sin said and pursed her lips. I laughed. Sin and Jett’s ongoing battle over her birth control pills had been hysterical.“And Fish says now we’re making babies, we gonna keep making them,” Marsha groused. “He don’t know three is all he’s getting; I’m getting on in age.”“Thirty-eight isn’t old; you keep giving me grandbabies; that’s your duty,” Ellen teased Marsha, whose mouth dropped open.“Seriously, you’re giving me shit? Adopt some of your own!” Marsha hit back, and Ellen threw her head back and laughed.“No way. Axel and I get to return them at the end of the day. Ain’t so stupid to tie ourselves down,” she said.“So you make the rest of us your baby-making machines?” I asked, and Ellen turned an innocent gaze on me.“Why Carly, of course!” she said, and Phoe laughed hysterically.“That’s funny shit!” Silvie said and patted her stomach as one twin kicked her hard. Yeah, it was funny shit, but the humour faded when I considered having Rock’s kids. Cute little boys that looked like their father. Oh yeah, that would be something.",

      "content": "Chapter Three.I felt far better when we left the hair salon. My hair was now a sleek, pretty coloured bob, and I kept pulling the coloured strands forward to look at them. I don’t know what I’d expected, but the three colours were interwoven with each other, making it a rainbow in my hair. And I loved the effect, and Rock realised that and smiled smugly. Rock stopped me in the middle of the street and took a photo so I could see. Not as much fun as pulling the strands forward, but I appreciated the thought.“Carly, I miss your long hair,” Rock said, taking a strand and letting it slip through his fingers.“Then I’ll grow it back just for you,” I murmured, looking across at the clothing shops Rock had stopped nearby. These were high-end shops, and while I didn’t doubt they’d have clothes to fit me, I wasn’t a high maintenance girl.“Yeah, you do that, baby,” Rock said.“Look, can’t we go to Target or Walmart? I just need a few basics Rock, I’ll be gaining weight hopefully soon, so these clothes won’t last long,” I said, not wanting to enter the high priced shops.“True, but I want you to have a few pretty dresses, so when I take you out, you feel good,” Rock said, gazing into my eyes earnestly. Damn, how could anyone say no to those beautiful, begging eyes without being a wicked bitch? Humour and smugness glinted in Rock’s eyes, and I knew I’d been played.“Fine,” I huffed, but without any strength behind it.“Carly, will you be okay for a few minutes? I just need to pick something up, and I won’t be more than five minutes,” Rock asked, and I hesitated. No, I didn’t want to be alone. Fear of my brothers threatened to overwhelm me. Shivers ran down my spine, and goosebumps rose on my arms. Rock noticed immediately and sought to soothe me by stroking my back gently.“Yeah,” I muttered, and Rock shook his head.“Nah, I’ll walk you over and see you safely inside, and then run my task. Honest Carly, I won’t leave you for more than a few minutes. Find several dresses; I rarely saw your pretty legs and want to see them on our dates,” Rock said, and I wondered if I should swoon. Rock wanted to date me, court me. He wasn’t going in gung-ho like the other brothers. Maybe Rock realised I’d be frightened of that, as I’d been dominated far too long.Yeah, I wasn’t the only one who’d been assaulted or hurt. Phoe, Lindsey, and Sin had, too. Silvie had been badly injured when she’d been run over by a rival gang. At first, I thought my brothers had been behind Silvie being hurt and was so relieved they hadn’t been. The guilt of my best friend being run over because of me was more than I could have handled.The difference between Phoe, Sin, Silvie and me was, they’d had time to get over their abuse, or it happened when in their relationship. Which meant their men went out of the way to protect them while I’d dealt with the abuse alone.Lindsey had been in the middle of an abusive marriage when she’d fled to Rage. And while I’d come to her battles late, I’d seen first-hand how Lindsey had put herself back together and how Lowrider had supported her. With Rock’s support, I’d recover so I wouldn’t be afraid of my shadow. Rock squeezed my shoulder as we reached the shop entrance, and I gazed with trepidation at the posh interior.“A few minutes Carly, that’s it,” Rock said, and I nodded. Rock dropped a brief kiss on my lips to bolster my courage, and I watched as his long legs strode away. Cautiously, I pushed open the door and entered. Yeah, this was a lovely shop, with clean lines and eye-catching displays. The clothes were expensive and of high quality. Quietly, I began browsing, keeping my head low as I searched for dresses that would make Rock’s eyes pop. I found three in the first few minutes and checked for their smallest size, which I thought may still be too big for me. I saw two snooty saleswomen by a desk and moved closer, intending to ask where changing rooms were.“Like she can afford to buy anything here,” one girl sneered, her back to me. Her colleague was facing her and sneered, not seeing me behind a rack of clothing.“I’ll flip you for it; I don’t want to serve her either. Waste of time. She looks like she just escaped from a Nazi prison camp.” The second girl giggled, and I winced as the barb hit home. Tears filled my eyes. Even with my new haircut, I was still a mess. I looked at the three dresses and my hands clenched. Pretty clothing wouldn’t hide the ugliness.“Deal, loser gets to serve that, as I got better things to do with my time than wait on her. Why on earth does she think she can afford anything in here, doesn’t our shop scream couture and money? She’s more Target than couture.” My head sank to my chest. The girl was correct. My shame deepened as I heard them flip, and one of them cry out at losing. They began a battle over best out of three, and I stepped back into an extremely large, angrily vibrating body. Rock’s arms clamped around me, and I twisted and buried my head in Rock’s chest.“Oh,” one girl said, sounding stunned.“Where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock thundered, and I clung tighter to him.“What?” girl one asked, sounding stunned and a little afraid.“Said, where’s your fuckin’ manager?” Rock repeated as his hand stroked my back, at odds with his aggressive tone.“Hello, I’m here, can I help?” a woman said, hurrying over. I felt the heat of Rock’s glower, even though I couldn’t see it.“Your two cunts here just got your shop blacklisted. My girl came here to get a few dresses, and those two bitches were tearing her apart, saying she couldn’t afford to shop here. How the fuck do they know who my girl is? And then the bitches they are likened my woman to a prisoner in a concentration camp,” Rock said furiously.“Rock,” I whispered, and his hand pushed me into his chest harder.“I… I… don’t use language like that in my shop, sir. I can apologise for my salesgirls….”“No fuckin’ buts. Know who I am? Who I belong to? Yeah, and when Rage blacklists a business, it goes under damn quick. Rage just blacklisted you. And FYI bitches, my girl was kidnapped and held hostage for six months. Maybe Rage ought to teach you a lesson on how to look good when you’ve been held for six months,” Rock threatened, and the girls paled. One began crying as Rock took the three dresses from my hand and threw them on the floor. Growling unhappily, Rock pulled his phone from his back pocket and dialled a number.“Phoenix put the word out, A Touch of Class is blacklisted, just insulted Carly,” Rock growled. Phoe replied, and Rock said that I was okay. He hung up, holding the eyes of the manager and called Drake and repeated his message.“Next time before you bitches open your mouth, don’t fuckin’ judge a person,” Rock told them and escorted me out of the shop. The manager began yelling at the girls as we left, and Rock steered me away.“Are you going to blacklist that shop?” I asked as Rock steered me towards another shop.“Fuck yeah, and tonight those two bitches are gonna get the fright of their spoiled bitch life,” Rock said.“Rock, they learned their lesson,” I said placatingly.“Don’t give a fuck,” Rock answered back, and I let it drop. I recognised that tone. I’d heard it in most brothers when they’d made their minds up. “Phoe recommended this shop; it’s new and just opened,” Rock said and opened the door, guiding me inside it. A cheerful, beautifully dressed salesgirl came rushing over, smiling at us.“Hello, welcome to Maddison’s Magic. Can I just say, I love your hair!” she said, beaming at me.“Thank you,” I said, her words a balm to my wounded ego.“How may I help you?”“My girl needs jeans, leggings, and tops. And at least three nice dresses suitable for fine dining. Actually, make that five,” Rock mused with a frown. “She doesn’t want too much, Carly’s been through some shit and lost weight, but she’s putting it back on slowly. So treat her right, and we’ll return when she needs more clothes,” Rock warned, and the girl grinned.“I’m Maddy, the Maddison on the sign, and I don’t need to be warned to treat a customer correctly. Now sweetie, let’s find you some clothing that will expand for a couple of sizes as you gain weight. Then you get more wear out of them,” Maddy said, smiling. I liked this cheerful girl and her positive attitude. Maddy took me to a sofa, and I sat as she rummaged through her racks and brought me clothing. Happily, Maddy encouraged me to try on leggings and jeans, tutting when she thought something looked wrong and grinning when she thought it was perfect.To my surprise, Rock seemed perfectly at ease being in a dress shop, watching me try clothing on, and modelling it for him. I’d have been happy with a trip to Target. Rock sat in a chair and played with his phone, glancing up as I exited the changing room. Maddy jumped in before Rock did, agreeing or disagreeing with the clothing I was modelling. After two hours, I finally called quits. I was too tired to continue, and I wanted food and rest. Maddy cheerfully chatted to Rock, not put off by his grunts as she bagged up my purchases and then offered a five percent discount.I’ll give Maddy her due. She was a canny businesswoman. By offering Rock five percent, she guaranteed he’d bring me back. Rock had insisted I wear a pretty yellow dress he’d picked, and I’d a cardigan over it. He glanced outside and realised I needed a coat, and Maddy sprang into action, picking three for me. Rock paid for them and slipped the first over my arms like a gentleman would. It was a lovely camel colour in thick-lined wool, falling to my knees and with a wide tanned leather belt. Rock also picked up a hat, scarf, and gloves and paid for them at the same time. Once again, Maddy offered the discount.Rock led me to his Dodge Charger, threw the bags inside the trunk, and asked where I wanted to eat. To be honest, I didn’t care; I needed food as my stomach was cramping painfully. I’d be happy grabbing something at the Reading Nook. Instead, Rock drove to Bernard’s restaurant and parked at the back. As we got out, I realised I still wore my shoddy sneakers and stopped walking.“Baby?” Rock asked, seeing the concern on my face.“Rock my shoes,” I whispered. Rock dropped his gaze to my feet and stepped forward, and wrapped an arm around me tightly.“Let anyone dare comment, baby,” Rock said, trying to reassure me. Without a further argument, he steered me into Bernard’s and the man himself came hurrying towards us. After effusive greetings, Bernard led us to a cosy table in the corner. Rock took the chair next to the wall so he could see what was coming, and I appreciated it. Bernard offered us his special of the day, to which Rock agreed, and I sat there squirming. There was no doubt Bernard’s was fine dining. The people surrounding us confirmed that, as did the décor. But Bernard himself was down to earth and friendly.Of course, I’d met him several times when he’d come to the clubhouse with his husband, Stefan, who was a close friend of Phoe. But dining in his restaurant was an entirely different matter. This was the man’s business, and he intended to spoil us, judging by his reaction. Bernard brought our drinks and appetisers, and I tucked in straight away. Rock had ordered a variety of tapas. I could have inhaled them; I was so hungry.“So, what do you fancy doing next? Shall we go shoe shopping?” Rock asked.“Yeah, I need some as, unfortunately, my sneakers don’t go with the dresses. Perhaps a pair of new sneakers and a nice pair of shoes for the dress?” I suggested, and Rock took on a mulish look before nodding. He’d agreed too quickly, and I was suspicious. As a waitress cleared away our plates, Rock reached into his cut pocket and withdrew several jewellery boxes. I gazed at the four boxes as Rock pushed them in front of me.“What are they?” I asked.“Ordered them the day after you returned, and I knew the truth,” Rock grunted. He nudged one towards me with a long finger, and I picked it up. Excited, I untied the ribbon and flicked the lid open and made an O with my mouth. Inside was a gold chain with an oval-shaped pendant containing a diamond.“How pretty,” I said, gazing at it. Rock rose to his feet, reached for the box, took the necklace out, and fastened it around my neck. He dropped a kiss on my neck and sat back down, and shoved a second box at me. Cheekily smiling, I opened it and discovered a matching bracelet. The third box held matching earrings, and the fourth an anklet.“Didn’t get you a ring because I know it interferes with your work. Lindsey is always bitching her rings have caught on something,” Rock said.“I didn’t expect these,” I said, smiling happily. I loved presents, presents felt better than Rock buying me clothes because I was needy.“Carly, you expect nothing,” Rock teased. Bernard approached with our mains. Rock had ordered the surf and turf platter, which with Bernard’s flourish meant two T-Bone steaks, lobster in a shell, crab, and king prawns. Added to that feast was calamari with a 16 oz gammon steak, ribs and a butterfly chicken breast. There was a large basket of fries and another containing garlic bread, and a third with garlic breaded mushrooms. A waitress brought dipping sauces. My eyes widened in horror at the amount of food, and Bernard laughed.“Enjoy!” Bernard chortled and disappeared.“Where do we start?” I asked, lost in the aromas floating from the platter. Rock pulled two plates towards him, cut the chicken breast in half, and did the same with the ribs and steak. Next, he added fries and sides and shoved a plate towards me.“Are you claiming the lobster?” I teased, and Rock winked. He cracked the shell open and scooped a forkful of the meat out, and held it out to me. I leaned forward and went to take the fork, and Rock moved it away. Then, with a wicked glint in his eyes, Rock offered the fork again, and this time when I leant forward, Rock placed the fork in my mouth. My eyes watered in pleasure. The lobster was succulent and delicious. Wow, Bernard could undoubtedly cook! As we ate, we chatted about Rock’s work and halfway through, I sat back and rubbed my stomach.“Damn, I’m full,” I muttered. Rock glanced at me dubiously, so I nodded to confirm my words. “Please finish; it would be a shame to waste the food; it was so wonderful.” Rock didn’t need telling twice, and finally, the platters were clean, and Rock sat back with a satisfied grunt. He patted his belly and grinned at me.“That’s earned you an extra half an hour at the gym,” I teased, and Rock chuckled.“Fuckin’ worth it, princess, man I could eat here every day,” Rock said.“The food was amazing; it’s the first time I’ve ever eaten here,” I said, and Rock nodded.“Rapid City got some great restaurants, but Bernard’s is most definitely the best. Hate to be one of those fuckers who have to book or take a risk on getting a table, love the fact we can get a table whenever we want. Change of subject, Carly, you ever been to Mount Rushmore?” I blinked at the abrupt change of topic.“No,” I said.“Was thinking we could ride tomorrow, take in the sights?” Rock suggested, and I beamed at him. Then my face fell.“I have to start working again soon,” I said.“Lindsey has put you back on the books already, honey. You’re on sick leave.” Rock grinned at me as a waitress cleared our plates, and Bernard hurried over with dessert. My eyes widened greedily at the plate of mini cheesecakes, two of each.“I think I just made room for dessert,” I giggled, and Rock grinned.“Babe, you always had a sweet tooth,” Rock teased.“Can’t deny that.” I smiled and scooped a bite of a chocolate cheesecake. I moaned in pure bliss, and Rock chuckled again.“So ride tomorrow?” Rock asked around bites.“Well, I shouldn’t let Lindsey pay me sick pay when I can work tomorrow,” I demurred, and Rock scowled.“Carly, you’re not going back to work until you put on at least twenty-four pounds. Girl, you look like a strong wind will blow you over. Lindsey’s in agreement. While she and Silvie are desperate to have you back, you’ve been through hell and need to fuckin’ heal a little. Lindsey said if you set foot over the shop’s threshold before a month’s over, she’ll fire you,” Rock grinned smugly, and I rolled my eyes.“Seriously? And what am I meant to do for money? My savings are just that, savings. I don’t want to break into them,” I muttered without heat.“What ya need money for?” Rock asked curiously as he scooped another bite of cheesecake.“Well, things, women’s things, clothes, food, somewhere to live,” I said, puzzled.“Let’s get this straight now; you keep missing the point, Carly,” Rock said sternly, and I glanced up, surprised at his tone. “If you want anything, I’ll buy it; you need to go to the shops for lady shit, you take my card, want to buy clothing, you take my card. As for a house, I got a place we can live, ain’t anything as grand as the others but I think you’ll like it. Needs furnishing, though, so you’ll….”“Take your card,” I interrupted. Rock offered a nod as I shook my head.“Please meet me halfway. Rock, I am not and never have been someone who lives off another person’s wallet. I work to afford nice things and had goals. But I won’t live off of you, Rock; I have pride,” I said. Rock grimaced.“Every woman has this argument, and I feel for my brothers now. Except for Drake, his wife is so fuckin’ rich, Drake has little choice,” Rock complained. I hid a smirk; Rock wasn’t wrong on that. “Look, I get you want to work, that’s admirable, but understand me as well. I ain’t a sissified wimp of a man; I’m a man who claims a woman and looks after her. So you keep your money for girlie shit but agree to say once a month you take my card and go apeshit on it. I pay bills and everything else, and your money buys your clothes and shit, can we agree?” Rock grumbled, sounding peeved. These men hated being told no.“Yes, we can agree on that,” I said happily, pleased I didn’t have to battle Rock for what he thought was his rights. Rock sent me a sly glance.“As we’re on our one agreed to blow it on my card day, let’s go shoe shopping because those dainty little feet of yours won’t put on weight,” Rock said, smirking. My nose twitched, and I knew he had me bang to rights, and I’d just walked straight into his trap. Smugly Rock paid the bill and led me from the restaurant.◆◆◆ “Bitch! I hate you, I need new shoes,” Lindsey cursed as she held up the blue velvet Jimmy Choo’s Rock had bought me.“Wowie!” Phoe squealed and hurried across. “Hot damn, Rock must have dropped a wad on these!” Phoe exclaimed.“Why can’t you be my shoe size?” Silvie whined, holding up a pair of gold strappy high-heeled sandals and glowering at me. I shrugged as she gazed at Apache, who was watching her, and he winced.“You can’t have the same shoes as Carly, or you’ll bitch,” Apache warned and turned his back. Silvie flipped him the finger and cooed at the matching bag for the sandals.“I need to go shopping,” Lindsey whined, gazing at Lowrider. Lowrider gazed calmly back.“Woman, how much did you drop on those shoes yesterday?” Lowrider asked.“Not a lot,” Lindsey muttered. Lowrider lifted an eyebrow, and Lindsey pursed her lips. “Okay, I dropped three thousand on them,” she muttered.“And the other pair?” Lowrider asked.“Three thousand again,” Lindsey said mulishly, and I was grinning outright.“What’s your monthly budget for shoes?” Lowrider asked, and I caught Apache smothering a smile.“Five thousand.” Lindsey made eyes at Lowrider.“So stop your bitching about needing more shoes. I ain’t making you take a thousand off next month’s budget… yet,” Lowrider said and turned back to his beer. Lindsey paled at the thought of her beloved shoe budget being downsized and poked her tongue out at Lowrider. Phoe and I cried with laughter.“What if Lindsey gets shoes as a gift?” Phoe called, and Lowrider turned and sent Phoe a stern glance. Phoe was well known to love to spoil people, and I saw Lowrider click onto her meaning.“Do I need to talk to Drake about your budget?” Lowrider asked, and Phoe shrugged.“Bleh, as if Drake would stop me. All I got to do is walk naked into our bedroom wearing a pair of heels, and Drake won’t argue.” Phoe grinned. Lowrider groaned and rubbed his forehead.“Fuck Phoe, I don’t need that image!” Lowrider cursed and turned his back. Drake broke out laughing, and Phoe grinned triumphantly. I liked pretty shoes but didn’t understand the need to hoard them like the others did. Lindsey, Phoe, and Silvie boasted a closet just for their shoes.“Holy shit, I need a pair like this. Did they do them in other colours?” Marsha exclaimed, holding up a pair of satin peep-toes.“Yes,” I said.“Fish!” Marsha roared, and I saw Fish roll his eyes.“Tomorrow, baby, Windfell may need to stock up after our girl cleared them out,” Fish called back.“See, Fish doesn’t set Marsha a limit,” Lindsey complained, making doe eyes at Lowrider.“Marsha don’t want a new pair of shoes every day,” Lowrider retorted, and Lindsey gave up arguing. Each old lady shopped at Windfells frequently. The shop was privately owned and was prominently placed in downtown Rapid City. When staff spied the old ladies coming, they knew they were onto a fantastic day, not just in sales but tips too. Their eyes had burst out of their head as Rock had dropped enough money to feed an army for a year.“Did Rock clear them out of everything?” Sin asked, strolling across her eyes wide. She gazed at the mass of boxes piled around us.“Enough that he had to call Klutz for a meet to collect them,” I said, laughing. Klutz had been good-natured about using his truck to ship my shoes back. I’d have been happy with one or two pairs, but Rock thought shoes linked to kinky sex. And after he told me that in an aside, I stopped arguing. Mainly because I had the image of Rock hot and sweaty, and kinky sex meant good things.“You look happy baby, those shadows in your eyes have gone,” Marsha said, peering into my face. She came in close, and I fought the urge to poke her in the eye. I hated people in my face.“Rock,” I said, and that one word explained it all. I stole a glance at him, legs splayed, sitting on a stool with a beer in hand. He was leaning forward, talking to Slick, who was nodding and motioning with his hands. A warmth settled in my belly, and I recognised it for what it was, love, acceptance and comfort, the sense and feeling of home.“Rock was foul, you know, these last six months,” Phoe said, nodding at Rock. Turning to her, I frowned.“He was?” I asked, and Silvie nodded vigorously.“Rock was awful, he’s never been verbose, but he became mute and downright snarly. It started the day you left.” Lindsey looked uncomfortable. “Rock had been watching you and was waiting for you to grow into your skin, and then he planned to make a move. That kiss you gave him and the scene that followed after in Made by Rage, Rock knew it was time to lay claim. Then you up and disappeared… shush, I know you didn’t plan to, girl.” Lindsey cut off what I was going to say.“Sorry,” I muttered.“We know what you did for us Carly, but we didn’t expect you to sacrifice yourself. None of us had a clue why you ran and we were all hurt. Carly, don’t you ever sacrifice yourself like that again,” Phoe scolded.“My brothers made it seem there wasn’t a choice,” I said and glanced away. Lindsey picked up on my awkwardness.“Rock saw his chance at getting everything he wanted, and then your asshole brothers snatched it from him. He was nasty, his darkness welled up and shit; I thought we were going to lose him like they lost Ace. Rock became monotone and evil, ready for a fight at the slightest insult, and there was a good few fights. That man was a walking hair-trigger temper,” Lindsey said.“Drake couldn’t reach him, and nor could Lex, and that was worrying because Rock and Lex are close. Lex tried, but Rock shut him down every time. He’d arrive at work with Apache, do his shifts here and hang around, but Rock wasn’t present,” Phoe said, and I heard the worry in her voice.“Yeah, Rock shut down; I think he thought he wasn’t entitled to beauty,” Silvie agreed. Guilt welled up, and I swallowed it back. That had been my fault. Rock hadn’t thought he was worthy when, in fact, it was me who wasn’t worthy of the man. I was nothing but trailer trash, and it was hard to understand why Rock wanted me.“Rock’s always been one of the silent brothers, solid and dependable. Guess he saw his dreams disappearing down the plughole and shut down,” Marsha said. “Which goes to show just how much Rock cares about you, girl.”“I’ve guessed that. Rock wants nothing more than to smother me in cotton wool and keep me by his side,” I said. Drake’s phone pinged, and moments later, he rose to his feet, Rock, Apache, Klutz and Slick behind him.“Stay inside,” Drake ordered, and we nodded. Moments later, Ellen hurried in, looking flustered with Texas’s daughter Rosie and Axel’s daughter Willow behind her.“I am FBI,” Willow was declaring loudly and looking mad.“Drake says get your ass inside, you get your ass inside,” Ellen said firmly and crossed her arms, glancing at the two young women. Axel’s woman wasn’t going to be moved, I noted. I’d only met Ellen once and wasn’t sure of the older woman. Lindsey and Silvie had been full of glee when they told me Axel had found his one, and Ellen seemed like a nice lady. She certainly held her own against the enormous mountain of a man by all reports.“Drake is not FBI,” Willow said mulishly. Phoe rolled her eyes.“Nope, but he’s your uncle, and you’ll do as you’re told!” Phoe said, and Willow frowned.“Don’t even think of arguing,” Marsha said, backing Phoe.“Christ, you can’t wrap me up in cotton wool forever!” Willow said and stormed across the room to the bar. Oh, I knew that feeling; I sympathised with the pretty woman who was glowering at the door and fingering the weapon she had strapped to her waist. From what I’d learned, Willow was fully capable of looking after herself after being undercover for many years. A cover so good that Axel had written Willow off as a lost cause.“Shopping Ellen?” Marsha asked as Ellen strolled across to us.“Yes, I thought I’d treat the girls to a manicure and pedicure day. Nailing Willow’s feet to the floor long enough to do so is a miracle. And even then, she wouldn’t leave her badge and weapon behind,” Ellen sighed and sank into an armchair. Willow sent Ellen a smug look.“Well, Willow was always more business than girlie girl,” Marsha agreed, and I smirked. Marsha waggled a finger at me; I liked the sound of Willow.“You’re just as bad, Carly; you can’t sit still,” Lindsey teased, and I nodded happily. Seriously, how boring was it to sit in a chair while people touched your feet? Urgh, no!“You will learn to enjoy them,” Silvie threatened, and I rolled my eyes at her.“What’s going on, anyway?” Sin asked as she slipped her shoes off and wriggled her toes.“You know Blaze keeps feeling watched? Autumn saw that guy once, but every so often, Blaze gets the feeling again?” Everyone nodded at Rosie as she sat. “I caught sight of a bike parked behind a truck, and his visor was firmly focused in Blake’s direction on the forecourt. So I texted Uncle Drake, and we got thrown in here.” Rosie sighed as Willow frowned.“How long has Blaze been sensing that?” Willow asked, scooting closer.“Not frequently, but for over a year now, Willow. Whoever it is, just watches. They haven’t approached Blaze or anything, so it’s strange. Blaze has no idea who it is, but it bothers him,” I said and jumped as bike pipes roared loudly, and I heard at least three bikes speed away. Drake entered with Calamity on his heels, who walked behind the bar and took over from where Klutz had been serving. Calamity leaned back against the wall behind the bar and gazed at Rosie, and sent her a wink. Marsha’s mouth dropped open as her gaze flicked between the two of them. Rosie poked her tongue out, and I shook my head as Calamity sent her a badass biker look.“Don’t you dare go there without your father’s approval,” Marsha warned, and Rosie scowled.“Dad doesn’t run my life; I run his!” Rosie muttered.“Your father will string Calamity up by his balls should he make a move on you without permission. It’s sacrilege to even consider making a move on a brother’s daughter without their fathers’ permission!” Silvie warned Rosie.“It’s just fun, we’re flirting, but I have to finish university first. I’ve a year left, and then I’m a qualified vet. Ain’t going to let nothing stand in the way of that Aunt Silvie,” Rosie demurred, but I saw the heat in the following glance she sent Calamity.“Oh boy,” Sin muttered. From the looks I saw on the other women’s faces, oh boy, was right. Texas was well known to be an overprotective father, and Rosie had been one of Rage’s few children. So she’d been overindulged and loved her entire life. And smothered… the brothers had been overly protective of Rosie, and she hadn’t been able to break free of their shackles until she went away to college. Even then, Texas tried to keep Rosie local, but she broke free and wandered off to attend university.“Get Penny on your side,” I muttered to Rosie, who grinned.“Not a bad idea,” Rosie muttered back. “Calamity’s still filling out, but you can see the brother he’s going to be.” Rosie was right, Calamity when he’d first arrived, had been a scrawny kid, the same age as me near enough and had been mistreated his entire life. Calamity got neck deep into trouble and came seeking a home and found Rage. The prospect had been taken on as a candidate, which progressed to prospect earlier than expected when he’d saved Silvie’s life from a serial killer.Calamity was taller than when he arrived, hitting six foot three now. He’d gained weight and muscle and was a good-looking man. Calamity was the cheerful one, nothing fazed him, and he’d a ready smile and cheerful manner. He was at odds with most of the brothers, who preferred stern and blank expressions. Even though he was rabidly friendly, Calamity was pretty close to Klutz, and they often sat chin-wagging in a corner.“They’re voting tonight,” Phoe said suddenly, and we glanced at her. “I heard Drake on the phone.“Huh?” Marsha asked.“On the candidates, so if anyone has any qualms about them, you better speak up, and I’ll drop a word in Drake’s ear,” Phoe said, looking around the gaggle of old ladies.“None here,” Sin said, relaxing back. Silvie moaned and rubbed her protruding stomach.“How much longer?” I asked. Silvie glowered and poked at her stomach.“Five weeks. These kids are in a damn hurry to escape,” she muttered.“I can’t believe Jett knocked me up again so quickly,” Sin groused, but her eyes belayed her happiness. And speak of the devil. Jett walked in carrying their two little girls, Amelia and Brooke. Amelia was on her feet and heading towards Uncle Drake before anyone could blink. Amelia completely loved Drake and him, her. Well, Drake loved all the kids. Drake swooped and swept Amelia up, tickling her under her chin as Jett made his way to Sin. Shit, that man was gorgeous, not as much as Rock but Jett had it going on.“Who else is pregnant?” I asked as Jett handed Brooke over to Sin for a feed. Sin pulled a blanket around her, and Brooke and I glanced away, giving them privacy. Drake had told me, but I wondered if any of the old ladies were keeping secrets.“Marsha three months, Artemis two months with one child this time, thank god, she’d have ripped Ace’s dick off if they had a third set of twins,” Phoe said, and I chuckled. Artemis was fully capable of doing so. “Autumn’s six months pregnant, with twins.”“Damn, how many sets of twins?” I gasped, and Phoe shrugged.“Given up counting, guess when you have Ace and Apache around, and Autumn, who have the genetics for twins, then we’re going to be drowned in them,” she replied.“How on earth did they get knocked up so quickly after their last pregnancies?” I asked, pointing at Marsha and Sin.“Think you know the answer to that,” Marsha hissed, and I blushed.“Wait till Rock gets it in his head he wants babies, see how long you keep your birth control pills for,” Sin said and pursed her lips. I laughed. Sin and Jett’s ongoing battle over her birth control pills had been hysterical.“And Fish says now we’re making babies, we gonna keep making them,” Marsha groused. “He don’t know three is all he’s getting; I’m getting on in age.”“Thirty-eight isn’t old; you keep giving me grandbabies; that’s your duty,” Ellen teased Marsha, whose mouth dropped open.“Seriously, you’re giving me shit? Adopt some of your own!” Marsha hit back, and Ellen threw her head back and laughed.“No way. Axel and I get to return them at the end of the day. Ain’t so stupid to tie ourselves down,” she said.“So you make the rest of us your baby-making machines?” I asked, and Ellen turned an innocent gaze on me.“Why Carly, of course!” she said, and Phoe laughed hysterically.“That’s funny shit!” Silvie said and patted her stomach as one twin kicked her hard. Yeah, it was funny shit, but the humour faded when I considered having Rock’s kids. Cute little boys that looked like their father. Oh yeah, that would be something.",

They thought they’d come for a vote on the candidates.“We still got the vote,” Drake said, confirming. “Then got issues with Blaze, Santos, Dark Souls of Lucifer, and finally Phoe and Carly.” Rock’s head snapped up at the mention of Carly.“Let’s get the vote out of the way,” Ace said, nodding, his eyes flicking to the three candidates outside the inner sanctum. It took less than ten minutes for the brothers to vote. “The three are unanimous votes for prospect,” Fish stated, and Drake nodded. “Call them in here.” Fish pulled out three prospect patches for the front of their cuts and then three longer ones that went on the bottom on their cut at the back.Unlike many MC’s, Rage had candidates for a year to see if the potential prospects would fit in with the club’s ideals. Rage having once gone bad, Drake, Texas, and Fish had brought this in to ensure the club’s safety. They’d kicked three candidates, one of which had been a serial killer, leaving Rage with Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage.Every candidate did a year before being voted to prospect; once prospect, they faced two to three years before becoming a brother. Yes, it was long-winded, but if you stuck it out, it meant you were what Rage was seeking. Not like the old days where Bulldog took possibilities straight in as brothers without a vote or trial period. It was one way of keeping Rage clean.Drake watched Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage enter. Of the three men, only Klutz showed nerves. Drake understood how much the club meant to Klutz and was glad the man had received clean votes. If one brother had declined, the candidate would have had one more year to prove himself and would be gone should he fail the vote again.“Grats the three of you. Welcome to prospect. Sit and be welcome in your first time in church,” Drake said. A huge grin broke out onto Klutz’s face while Savage nodded his head in acknowledgement, and Gauntlet offered a small smile and nod to everyone.“First order of business, Blaze. Ya know that Blaze every so often feels he’s being watched. Earlier, Rosie caught someone watching. Rock, Klutz and Slick gave chase,” Drake said and nodded to Rock.“Fucker was on a Yamaha, fled as soon as we pulled out. Chased him for a while and lost him around the Sioux San Hospital. The asshole was quick off the mark, and we got held up by a fucking ambo pulling out. By the time we cleared it, asshole was gone,” Rock growled.“What you need?” Slate asked Blaze. They’d been prospects together. Drake found those that who were prospects together were incredibly loyal to one another. Their bond was stronger.“We ain’t got a sense of threat yet, but don’t like Blaze being alone,” Texas said, glancing over at Blaze.“Yeah, I feel something bad aimed at me, but not a threat. Don’t know, man, hard to explain. Without evidence, don’t want to jump the gun,” Blaze said.“Keep our eyes open and see if this fucker returns and if so, take action?” Lex suggested, and next to him, Ezra nodded.“We ain’t got nothing else to act on, so yeah, streets are silent, no one knows who’s watching Blaze. Or if Blaze has an enemy outside of Rage, which again we got nothing,” Ace said.“First sign of something wrong, you call for backup, Blaze and make sure you’re carrying at all times. Have you got a concealed licence?” Apache asked.“Yeah,” Blaze grunted. He didn’t appear outwardly worried, but Drake knew his brother was. This had been happening for a year, and no one had any idea why.“Blaze, you feel threatened, hole up and call, you hear me, boy?” Axel threatened, and Blaze said yeah again.“Santos has been seen outside Spearfish, Chance’s territory. Hellfire’s now got feelers out,” Ace said, and backs stiffened across the room. Santos owed Rage, and they planned to get their due.“Just a sighting?” Gunner asked, and Drake nodded. Gunner’s woman, Autumn, had been the last victim of Santos, and Gunner was fit to burn for the man.“Yeah, him getting in a car. Snitch saw Santos and informed Chance. Could be why we ain’t found hide or hair of him here,” Drake replied.“Will let James know,” Gunner said, and Drake nodded.“Better it comes from you. Washington has a claim as good as ours to the man, and he’s burning for blood. Rage gets Santos, Washington needs to know,” Drake said, and everyone nodded. James Washington, Gunner’s brother, had lost his closest friend, Frank, a man he called brother to Santos. Washington wanted blood and wanted it yesterday.“Autumn and I will take a ride to James tomorrow morning,” Gunner said.“Keep James informed and make sure Washington knows that goes both ways. Man may be trying to get clean, but he doesn’t act without Rage. Santos owes us too,” Drake said.“James knows,” Gunner replied.“Inglorious has heard that Dark Souls of Lucifer have reformed. The gang scattered after that shit with Silvie, but they’re hiding out again with a new Prez. Like Santos, we can’t fuckin’ trace them, but, we know now, they are working for the cunt,” Texas said, and faces gazed at him.“Tell me you’re fuckin’ joking?” Slick demanded.“Wish I could say I was brother,” Texas replied.“Santos has recruited a biker gang to hunt us? Is the man completely off his rocker?” Mac laughed.“Don’t he get how much firepower Rage can bring to the game should it go us against a gang?” Manny asked.“Why a biker gang, though?” Gauntlet asked, and everyone turned to him. “Seems distraction to me.”“Carry on,” Drake encouraged.“We’re chasing our tails, looking for the pricks. Meanwhile, Santos is getting time to get back on his feet after the showdown with Washington. Santos lost a shit load of men, so he needs time to recruit. Means we’re chasing shadows while Santos builds his strength back up,” Gauntlet explained.“Shit,” Mac growled, “crafty fucker.”“Well, we knew Santos wouldn’t go without a fight,” Manny said, and Lowrider nodded.“Yeah, and could this shit with Blaze be a distraction, too? Rage is chasing shadows with nothing concrete,” Hunter asked, and Drake sat back.“May be onto something. Rage is distracted, looking into shadows for threats when there ain’t none. And Santos is gaining time to do what he needs, and with us distracted, our attention is elsewhere,” Axel boomed.“And add to the fact Santos knows we’ll move to protect women and children, maybe we should be asking if any of them have felt watched?” Jett suggested. Every brother with an old lady suffered a sudden chill in their stomach.“All well and good us finding and claiming, but the women are at risk too,” Slate pointed out.“Fuck,” Apache groaned.“Nah, if one of those women had bad feelings, you’d know about it. They learned their lessons, ignoring Frenzy. A fuckin’ hard lesson,” Manny said, and his face tightened. Sin had been one of the women who’d felt threatened but felt unable to bring it to a brother. She may be Jett’s woman, but she was close to Manny.“That be true,” Texas said.“The kids? Would they bring it to us?” Mac pointed out.“Elder kids, yeah, anyone over ten would. Those below probably not, although fear may manifest in other ways. But Santos knows, our kids get touched, we’ll burn his family. Don’t believe the asshole is that stupid,” Lowrider said.“No? Santos handed his own father over to Rage for the sake of money,” Ace pointed out, and every brother at the table blanched.“Santos won’t touch the kids. He’s got a thing for kids being abused, asshole may traffic women, but we know Santos don’t hold with abusing them,” Lowrider said.“Wanna understand how the fuck that works,” Apache growled. “Asshole sells women who get raped and abused. But Santos don’t hold with abusing them?”“Not a single woman is ever harmed in his hands; once he’s sold them, it ain’t down to him. Or so he thinks,” Lowrider said. Lindsey had spoken of her conversation with Santos when she’d been kidnapped by him.“Spineless cunt,” Rock spat fury in his voice.“Ain’t arguing there,” Fish said.“Make sure all kids over ten understand if they feel someone watching or feel unsafe, talk to a brother. And we’ll get the old ladies to monitor the under tens. Provide a safe place for the kids to talk,” Drake said, thinking of his brood of kids. Fuck, his daughter Peyton was only a few months old, Phoe having given birth in June. And Drake would burn the city for her.“Ain’t much else we can do, can’t put a guard on every kid,” Axel said. “Keep the over tens and old ladies alert. Someone tries to take one of their kids; there’ll be a bullet in the asshole’s brain before he can say fuck me. Gotta agree, don’t think the kids are at risk, maybe Santos will take a run at the women, but they can handle it. Need to trust them.” Axel spoke the bitter truth, and Drake swallowed it harshly.Drake didn’t like it. Rage had too many potential victims, and Drake suddenly regretted that brothers were making families. Family had been a dream of his for years, and yet now it caused headaches. Then Drake shoved it aside ruthlessly. Yeah, they had potential victims, but life couldn’t be ruled by fear. One of theirs had already been snatched, Jett’s Amelia, and they’d saved her and would again should another child be taken. Drake had to trust in his brothers and in his close circle. The moment Drake started doubting their ability to protect what was theirs was the moment Santos won.“Onto Phoe. Woman’s organising a charity bike run between the local towns, want us to plan a route and get our associates involved. Phoe wants the Road Captain to carry a flame of hope and raise money. She’s got Stefan setting up a website for donations but wants brothers to collect on route.” Drake said, swapping his mind to his wife.“Done, I’ll organise with the other clubs; you got enough shit to deal with,” Ace said, stepping up to the plate. While Drake was not only Prez but Road Captain, Ace knew he’d a lot on his plate. “Can get old ladies and friends stationed every so far apart on the route and the older kids to collect with buckets.”“Phoe’s doing a big advertising theme in South Dakota, so should pull crowds. Stefan’s organising a big fair at Founders Park, so the route will end there. Ace get with Phoe and see what she needs and then organise it with Stefan. Don’t let that crazy fuck talk you into theme dresses or similar shit,” Drake warned, and a few smiles cracked around the table. It was well known that Phoe’s Director of Fundraising was nuts.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Hawthorne sent Davies up to check her brothers. Two’s missing,” Drake said, and Rock stiffened. Rock’s gaze shot to the rec room where Carly was curled next to Silvie on a sofa with her hand on Silvie’s belly.“Don’t tell her,” Rock warned.“You don’t tell her, my girl don’t see shit coming, she’ll get hurt,” Blaze said and held Rock’s eyes. Rock wavered.“My girl,” Rock snarled back.“Our girl, she needs to know, so she’s prepared. Carly ain’t weak, and if she’s not warned, she makes herself a target,” Blaze argued. Drake rolled his eyes; this would carry on all night. Rock would want to protect his girl, and Blaze would want her warned.“As Prez, it’s my decision. Carly gets told Rock, girl can handle herself,” Drake muttered, thinking back to Carly stabbing Lindsey’s ex-husband with a pair of shears.“Drake…” Rock argued.“No, the last thing Carly wants is to walk down the street unaware danger is lurking. Her brothers can grab Carly because she’s not paying attention, girl’s not looking. Makes Carly an easy target,” Drake said and sliced the air with his hand. Rock burned with fury for a few moments and then sank into his chair.“Carly’s just starting to heal,” Rock said.“Carly will continue to heal, but she can be alert, too. Maybe they ain’t coming for her. Who the fuck knows? Davies is tracking them, when he finds them, we’ll know, but it’s an order, Rock, tell Carly,” Drake said firmly, and Rock gave up ungracefully.◆◆◆ Rock left the inner sanctum and came straight to me. My bags and boxes had been loaded up in Jett’s pick up on Sin’s orders. Sin was determined to make his life hell as he’d knocked her up again so quickly. She winked and smiled sweetly as she held Brooke in her arms as Jett came out and glanced at her to reassure himself she was okay.“Jett’s going to blow,” I whispered, and Sin smiled smugly.“Jett shouldn’t keep knocking me up then,” Sin said. “Here, hold Brooke while I tell Jett he needs to take your shit to Rock’s place.” I looked up, surprised, as Sin dumped Brooke into my arms, and I held her close and gently touched her cheek. She was beautiful, with her father’s black hair and her mother’s blue eyes. Brooke daintily yawned and closed her eyes. Rock sat on the arm of my chair as I heard Jett curse.“Was you in on that?” Rock chuckled as he reached out a finger and stroked Brooke’s hair. Jett’s voice rose loudly. Brooke’s eyes flew open, and the tiny baby stared at Rock before offering a smile and closing her eyes again.“No, I told Sin not to,” I denied, and Rock chuckled. One muscled arm slid around my shoulders, and the second cupped my arm, holding Brooke.“Suits you,” Rock whispered in my ear, and my eyes flew to his and dropped at the heat in them. Jett stormed up and held his hand out, and Rock, smirking, placed a set of keys in his hand.“Just dump it in the front room,” Rock smirked, and Jett shot him a dirty look.“Ain’t a prospect, brother,” Jett said and strode away. Insult showed in every line of his body, and Blaze and Slate jeered at him. As Jett passed, both his fists shot out, and he punched each brother before leaving. Texas was howling with laughter as Slate rubbed his jaw and Blaze his eye.“Idiots won’t learn that Jett can hit with both fists,” Rock grunted and shifted me so he could seat me on his lap. I flinched and checked to see if Brooke had woken, but she was snoring gently in my arms.“Nope,” I agreed.“Darlin’, two of your brothers are missing. Hawthorne is chasing them. No need to worry but be alert,” Rock said as my body stiffened.“Are they coming for me?” I asked.“Not that we’re aware of, but Drake had Hawthorne following up to make sure you were safe. Once we track them, we’ll handle it if they’re in Rapid City,” Rock reassured me. “Want you armed, Carly; know you can shoot, so you need to be armed.”“Okay,” I said, not knowing if I could shoot one of my brothers. Then again, they’d chained me like a dog, sold my virginity, beaten and whipped me. Yeah, I could shoot those bastards.“Carly, you okay?” Rock asked, dipping his head to mine.“Of course. At least I know to be aware of them. If they come at me here, they’ll bleed,” I said firmly. Rock’s mouth twisted.“Wasn’t going to tell you, but Drake ordered it,” Rock muttered.“That would have been foolish. I fear them and what they’re capable of. But if I didn’t know they might come for me, they’d have caught me off guard, and I’d have been an easy target. Now I know those assholes are coming, and I can take measures to protect myself. Pepper spray, taser, knife, and gun. Hey, fancy shopping tomorrow?” I asked, and Rock pulled his head back.“Shit, you get excited at buying weapons, but not clothing and shoes?” Rock chuckled.“Well, yeah,” I giggled, and he shook his head.“Carly Lennon, you have hidden depths, woman.” Rock glanced up as Klutz called out for who wanted takeout. Rock called out a no, and I pouted; I was hungry.“We’re gonna hand this little lady back to her momma, and we’re going home. We’ll pick food up on the way,” Rock said as he caught Sin’s eye. She hurried over and took Brooke from me, and I called out goodbye as Rock and I left the clubhouse.“Let me guess, we’re getting tacos,” I teased. It was a well-known fact that Rock adored tacos. If takeout was on offer, Rock constantly voted for them. Rock sent me a cheeky grin, and I rolled my eyes.“Already ordered them, being delivered in half an hour,” Rock said, and I smiled. He walked over to his bike and swung up onto it, and gazed at me. “What you waiting for? Come on, Carly, time to ride.” If I needed confirmation that Rock was serious about us, this was it.Rage had a policy that no woman rode behind them unless they were their old lady. Not even bunnies one of the brothers might date, rode behind them. Other bikers may not care who rode behind them, but for Rage, it was a statement, only an old lady. Happily, I scurried over and, placing my foot on the footrest, I swung up behind Rock and shunted forward. I wrapped my arms around him and leaned my head on Rock’s back.“Get you a helmet tomorrow,” Rock grunted and throttled his bike. “Hold on tight, Carly.”Shit, I was overwhelmed when Rock hit the road on his Harley Davidson Breakout. The bike vibrated beneath me, and I felt the power in the machine creep into my bones. Riding like this was so freeing, relaxing and I felt one with the bike. Rock expertly steered us through the streets, his exhaust roaring as the sound bounced off buildings. He took me towards the outskirts of the city and turned down Nameless Cave Road.Rock approached a high electric gate and pressed a button on his bike, and the gate swung open, and Rock whizzed past. From what I remembered, several of his brothers weren’t far from here. I found it amusing that they congregated within twenty minutes of each other. For Rage, it wasn’t enough they met up at the clubhouse. Their bonds were so tight they had to live close to each other as well. With a backwards glance, I saw the gate swinging shut behind us, and Rock rode the bike up a well-maintained road and pulled up in front of a house.Whatever I’d been expecting, it wasn’t this. It was a two-storey house that had been extended a lot. The original was made of stone and had cute circular windows and an entrance set in the middle. Above that was another set of doors with a balcony overlooking the stunning countryside. To the right was a double extension, the bottom half was brick, and the top half was wood framed. And to the left was a stone and wood extension with a balcony running the entire length and disappearing around the corner. This held large windows while the other extension had smaller windows. A slate roof capped it off.“House ain’t much, was my grandparents. Think it was my great-great-great granddaddy who built the original, and then my great-grandparents added the first wing,” Rock said, pointing to the right-hand side extension. “My grandparents added the left-hand wing and the extensions out back.” I thoroughly disagreed with Rock’s version of it ain’t much. Despite its colossal size, I loved it already. The right-hand side held a porch with a giant swing and a small wrought iron table, and two chairs.I swung off the bike, and Rock followed suit. The surrounding area was overgrown, but I thought I saw remains of flower beds, and I could swear there was a pond near the house. Rock strolled towards the house and opened the door, and I flew up the two steps behind him and entered a massive room. The house was barely furnished, just an armchair and sideboard, but the room was amazing. It was painted cream and showed its beams in the walls and ceilings, and it opened straight into the roof that held two skylights, flooding the room with sunlight. I was practically vibrating in excitement, wishing to explore.“Off you go,” Rock said, giving me a gentle push. I didn’t hesitate and flew through the first door to the right. Excited, I entered another vast room with a sofa and a large screen tv. There was a black rug thrown on the floor, but nothing else. The walls were exposed brick and wood panelling, and I fell in love with the massive stone fireplace opposite the entrance. Glancing to my left, I spied two French doors and peeking through, I saw they led to a bright glass and wood sunroom.My mind busy making plans; I returned to the first room and saw several doors; I opened the one opposite the front door and found a downstairs cloakroom. The door next to that led to a small hallway, and striding down it, I discovered a snug that again was empty. I raced back out and went through the first door on the left and found Rock’s study. It was a disaster, so I quickly closed the door. The second door on the left led into the left wing, and I walked through what I thought was the dining room. There was a door at the back, but I ignored it for now and continued into the following room.This held a matching fireplace to the room in the right extension and had the plaster cut away, exposing beams. The room was completely empty, and I spied a door at the back and walked through it. This led to a set of three small rooms whose use I’d no idea, and then I discovered the kitchen and nearly sank to my knees and cried. In front of me was a masterpiece of a country farmhouse kitchen, and my eyes gazed greedily at the huge eight hob range cooker with bespoke hand-crafted cabinets. I trailed my hand over the Welsh dresser that had undoubtedly been crafted just for this kitchen.Behind me was another door, and on opening it, I discovered an additional four rooms. One was a utility, one a pantry, the third a cloakroom, and the fourth I was unsure of. This was empty but had a table and a large window with shelves on the walls and empty jars. Moonshine? Jams? I would have to ask Rock.The Welsh dresser was set into the middle of the wall, and there was a door next to it which further exploration showed it led back to the dining room. The kitchen had a dining table sat at one end, a small scruffy thing at odds with the beauty of the kitchen. Behind that was a glass wall with a door set into it. That led me back to the sunroom on the right-hand side. One part of the kitchen ceiling was glass, letting the sunlight in, while the other part was exposed beams and peering outside; I could see the balcony continued round the back of the house.Puzzled that I hadn’t found any stairs, I wandered back to the first room where I discovered a hidden door, cleverly cut into the wall and opening it I found them. I jogged up them and encountered a long landing. Heading to the far-right-hand side, I opened the doors into two bedrooms of decent size and a family bathroom before wandering back to the old part. A door opened into the master bedroom, and I shut the door because I didn’t want to invade Rock’s privacy until asked to.The left-hand side held another three bedrooms and a further bathroom. At the end of the left-hand side was another flight of stairs, and scrambling up them, I found a converted wide-open space just sitting unused. My mind scrambled for what it could be used for as I wandered back downstairs to find Rock.“Why is there no furniture?” I asked Rock when I entered the kitchen.“When my grandparents died, the house needed a mass of repairs. BlackRock was just taking off, so I let things lapse even further. A year ago, I started working on this and moved everything into storage. You’re welcome to go through it, baby, and see what you like. Grandma had good taste, but it might not be yours,” Rock said as he made sandwiches.“The house is beautiful,” I said, pulling out a stool at the breakfast bar.“Redecorated it with you in mind,” Rock said and shocked me speechless. “What? There was never a moment I wouldn’t claim you, Carly, just wanted you to spread your wings a bit. You were always mine, girl, nothing more to say,” Rock said and placed a sandwich in front of me. I ignored it as I considered his words. For a few moments, I allowed them to sink deep into my bones as I realised what Rock was saying. He’d cared for me longer than I thought, even more than I’d believed. Rock had decorated his grandparent’s home with me in mind, and I understood his reason. Rock had desired to give me a home.“Shit,” I muttered as tears snuck into my eyes. Rock had seen the real me, the one who desired a home and love. Not the scrappy shy thing I usually was, but the lost, lonely girl who wanted nothing more than to be accepted and wanted. Rock had seen more than I thought, considering I kept my past secret and tightly guarded.“Don’t stress it,” Rock said, placing a hand over mine and dropping a kiss on my forehead.“Bit hard not to, you did this for me, and I have nothing to offer you,” I said, leaning back against his hard body.“You offer me redemption, a chance at beauty, love and family. Don’t got family Carly, except my Rage brothers and kids. My blood family turned against me a long time ago, all apart from my grandparents,” Rock said, sitting, but his gaze was unfocused, lost in the past.“Are they dead?” I asked gently.“My grandparents, yes. My family no. Mom, Dad, two sisters and a brother, various aunts and uncles and cousins, are still alive. But I didn’t fit in, see, they’re rich and well to do, and I’m me. Money meant shit to me; family and a good moral compass meant more. They didn’t understand that I couldn’t get on with their fancy friends and suck up the bullshit they do,” Rock said.“Would I have heard of them?” I asked, and Rock grunted and smiled bitterly.“Am pretty damn sure you would have. My father is the Governor of Virginia,” Rock said and waited.“No way, your father is Mitchell Johnson?” I said, gasping. Mitchell Johnson was constantly in the papers pushing one agenda or another. The family were old money and elitist, from what I read.“Yeah, my name is Heath Johnson. And I was the black sheep of the family. Was kicked out to make my own way at eighteen when I rebelled and refused to follow my father into law and politics. Even worse, they’d made fuckin’ arrangements with a friend of his for me to marry his daughter when I finished college. Who the fuck does that? I was disowned and left to make my own way. So I’ve made my own way, and BlackRock Construction is doing fuckin’ well, and we lead the way in green housing,” Rock said proudly.“You are?” I asked, trying to assimilate the information.“Yeah, we are, and we’ve taken on new teams for out-of-state projects. We’re the biggest construction company in South Dakota now that deals with turning commercial buildings into housing. We also reclaim old, abandoned sites and clean them up and put affordable housing on them,” Rock said proudly.“That’s wonderful, and I imagine your family knows nothing about this?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope, not from me. I bet they got eyes on me, though,” Rock mused.“Isn’t your father going to be running for vice president?” I asked, and Rock nodded.“Yeah, which is why I wouldn’t be surprised if they had eyes on me. Can’t have my skeletons crawling out of the closet while Daddy Dearest is running his campaign. Wouldn’t surprise me if they know what I’m doing, and they try to draw me back into the fold,” Rock said and bit into his sandwich.“What will you do if they try?” I asked curiously.“Tell them to go to fuckin’ hell. Fuckers ain’t wanted me for over half my life, so fuck ‘em all. Mitchell and his family ain’t mine. They threw me away, out into the cold and if not for my mother’s parents, who’d have known what might have become of me. My grandparents were simple people. Fuck knows how they raised my mother. But they had family money, and they left it to me alongside the house. Helped me start BlackRock Construction with Apache.”“Then it’s good you had them,” I said with a small smile and took a bite of my sandwich. Flavours exploded in my mouth, and my eyes widened. “This is s’great,” I mumbled around my mouthful.“Just a basic sandwich, baby. Yeah, my grandparents were the best. They despised what my mother turned into, a snobby rich bitch who forgot the fundamentals my grandparents taught her. My sister’s married well-to-do assholes and my brother married the woman I was supposed to. None of them appear happy marriages. My grandparents weren’t even invited because they were classed as small-town hicks. Can you imagine disrespecting your parents like that?”“Not if they were good parents, no,” I agreed. Rock’s face took on an apologetic expression.“Sorry, baby,” he said.“No, don’t be. My mom did her best, but she was tired when I was born. Your grandparents sound amazing, and I wish I could have met them,” I said, smiling.“Carly, they’d have loved you,” Rock said with his own bittersweet smile.“I’m sure the feeling would have been mutual.”“Well, whatever, my mother challenged their will after grandpa died, and she couldn’t overturn it. All the money my father has, and the bitch wanted the money from my grandparents. Greed breeds greed,” Rock said bitterly.“And she didn’t like it that everything was left to you?” I suggested.“Exactly, that was the first time I’d heard from her in years, and it was to be served paperwork they were challenging the will. My siblings were insulted that they hadn’t been given a fair share. When the judge heard how my grandparents had been treated and the fact they’d tied the will up tightly, he threw it out and made them pay costs. Called them greedy to their faces,” Rock chuckled.“I bet that went down like a ton of bricks!” I exclaimed.“And then some,” Rock laughed. I enjoyed hearing him laugh. Rock was usually grim and silent. Rock was openly verbose with me, and he laughed and chuckled more easily. I wondered who else had ever seen this side of him because from my memories, even with Rage, Rock was tight-lipped.“They don’t matter, Rock; you have a family and a good one,” I said, seeking to reassure him.“Yeah, and they and you are all that matters,” Rock said firmly, and I winked at him as he smiled happily.",

They thought they’d come for a vote on the candidates.“We still got the vote,” Drake said, confirming. “Then got issues with Blaze, Santos, Dark Souls of Lucifer, and finally Phoe and Carly.” Rock’s head snapped up at the mention of Carly.“Let’s get the vote out of the way,” Ace said, nodding, his eyes flicking to the three candidates outside the inner sanctum. It took less than ten minutes for the brothers to vote. “The three are unanimous votes for prospect,” Fish stated, and Drake nodded. “Call them in here.” Fish pulled out three prospect patches for the front of their cuts and then three longer ones that went on the bottom on their cut at the back.Unlike many MC’s, Rage had candidates for a year to see if the potential prospects would fit in with the club’s ideals. Rage having once gone bad, Drake, Texas, and Fish had brought this in to ensure the club’s safety. They’d kicked three candidates, one of which had been a serial killer, leaving Rage with Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage.Every candidate did a year before being voted to prospect; once prospect, they faced two to three years before becoming a brother. Yes, it was long-winded, but if you stuck it out, it meant you were what Rage was seeking. Not like the old days where Bulldog took possibilities straight in as brothers without a vote or trial period. It was one way of keeping Rage clean.Drake watched Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage enter. Of the three men, only Klutz showed nerves. Drake understood how much the club meant to Klutz and was glad the man had received clean votes. If one brother had declined, the candidate would have had one more year to prove himself and would be gone should he fail the vote again.“Grats the three of you. Welcome to prospect. Sit and be welcome in your first time in church,” Drake said. A huge grin broke out onto Klutz’s face while Savage nodded his head in acknowledgement, and Gauntlet offered a small smile and nod to everyone.“First order of business, Blaze. Ya know that Blaze every so often feels he’s being watched. Earlier, Rosie caught someone watching. Rock, Klutz and Slick gave chase,” Drake said and nodded to Rock.“Fucker was on a Yamaha, fled as soon as we pulled out. Chased him for a while and lost him around the Sioux San Hospital. The asshole was quick off the mark, and we got held up by a fucking ambo pulling out. By the time we cleared it, asshole was gone,” Rock growled.“What you need?” Slate asked Blaze. They’d been prospects together. Drake found those that who were prospects together were incredibly loyal to one another. Their bond was stronger.“We ain’t got a sense of threat yet, but don’t like Blaze being alone,” Texas said, glancing over at Blaze.“Yeah, I feel something bad aimed at me, but not a threat. Don’t know, man, hard to explain. Without evidence, don’t want to jump the gun,” Blaze said.“Keep our eyes open and see if this fucker returns and if so, take action?” Lex suggested, and next to him, Ezra nodded.“We ain’t got nothing else to act on, so yeah, streets are silent, no one knows who’s watching Blaze. Or if Blaze has an enemy outside of Rage, which again we got nothing,” Ace said.“First sign of something wrong, you call for backup, Blaze and make sure you’re carrying at all times. Have you got a concealed licence?” Apache asked.“Yeah,” Blaze grunted. He didn’t appear outwardly worried, but Drake knew his brother was. This had been happening for a year, and no one had any idea why.“Blaze, you feel threatened, hole up and call, you hear me, boy?” Axel threatened, and Blaze said yeah again.“Santos has been seen outside Spearfish, Chance’s territory. Hellfire’s now got feelers out,” Ace said, and backs stiffened across the room. Santos owed Rage, and they planned to get their due.“Just a sighting?” Gunner asked, and Drake nodded. Gunner’s woman, Autumn, had been the last victim of Santos, and Gunner was fit to burn for the man.“Yeah, him getting in a car. Snitch saw Santos and informed Chance. Could be why we ain’t found hide or hair of him here,” Drake replied.“Will let James know,” Gunner said, and Drake nodded.“Better it comes from you. Washington has a claim as good as ours to the man, and he’s burning for blood. Rage gets Santos, Washington needs to know,” Drake said, and everyone nodded. James Washington, Gunner’s brother, had lost his closest friend, Frank, a man he called brother to Santos. Washington wanted blood and wanted it yesterday.“Autumn and I will take a ride to James tomorrow morning,” Gunner said.“Keep James informed and make sure Washington knows that goes both ways. Man may be trying to get clean, but he doesn’t act without Rage. Santos owes us too,” Drake said.“James knows,” Gunner replied.“Inglorious has heard that Dark Souls of Lucifer have reformed. The gang scattered after that shit with Silvie, but they’re hiding out again with a new Prez. Like Santos, we can’t fuckin’ trace them, but, we know now, they are working for the cunt,” Texas said, and faces gazed at him.“Tell me you’re fuckin’ joking?” Slick demanded.“Wish I could say I was brother,” Texas replied.“Santos has recruited a biker gang to hunt us? Is the man completely off his rocker?” Mac laughed.“Don’t he get how much firepower Rage can bring to the game should it go us against a gang?” Manny asked.“Why a biker gang, though?” Gauntlet asked, and everyone turned to him. “Seems distraction to me.”“Carry on,” Drake encouraged.“We’re chasing our tails, looking for the pricks. Meanwhile, Santos is getting time to get back on his feet after the showdown with Washington. Santos lost a shit load of men, so he needs time to recruit. Means we’re chasing shadows while Santos builds his strength back up,” Gauntlet explained.“Shit,” Mac growled, “crafty fucker.”“Well, we knew Santos wouldn’t go without a fight,” Manny said, and Lowrider nodded.“Yeah, and could this shit with Blaze be a distraction, too? Rage is chasing shadows with nothing concrete,” Hunter asked, and Drake sat back.“May be onto something. Rage is distracted, looking into shadows for threats when there ain’t none. And Santos is gaining time to do what he needs, and with us distracted, our attention is elsewhere,” Axel boomed.“And add to the fact Santos knows we’ll move to protect women and children, maybe we should be asking if any of them have felt watched?” Jett suggested. Every brother with an old lady suffered a sudden chill in their stomach.“All well and good us finding and claiming, but the women are at risk too,” Slate pointed out.“Fuck,” Apache groaned.“Nah, if one of those women had bad feelings, you’d know about it. They learned their lessons, ignoring Frenzy. A fuckin’ hard lesson,” Manny said, and his face tightened. Sin had been one of the women who’d felt threatened but felt unable to bring it to a brother. She may be Jett’s woman, but she was close to Manny.“That be true,” Texas said.“The kids? Would they bring it to us?” Mac pointed out.“Elder kids, yeah, anyone over ten would. Those below probably not, although fear may manifest in other ways. But Santos knows, our kids get touched, we’ll burn his family. Don’t believe the asshole is that stupid,” Lowrider said.“No? Santos handed his own father over to Rage for the sake of money,” Ace pointed out, and every brother at the table blanched.“Santos won’t touch the kids. He’s got a thing for kids being abused, asshole may traffic women, but we know Santos don’t hold with abusing them,” Lowrider said.“Wanna understand how the fuck that works,” Apache growled. “Asshole sells women who get raped and abused. But Santos don’t hold with abusing them?”“Not a single woman is ever harmed in his hands; once he’s sold them, it ain’t down to him. Or so he thinks,” Lowrider said. Lindsey had spoken of her conversation with Santos when she’d been kidnapped by him.“Spineless cunt,” Rock spat fury in his voice.“Ain’t arguing there,” Fish said.“Make sure all kids over ten understand if they feel someone watching or feel unsafe, talk to a brother. And we’ll get the old ladies to monitor the under tens. Provide a safe place for the kids to talk,” Drake said, thinking of his brood of kids. Fuck, his daughter Peyton was only a few months old, Phoe having given birth in June. And Drake would burn the city for her.“Ain’t much else we can do, can’t put a guard on every kid,” Axel said. “Keep the over tens and old ladies alert. Someone tries to take one of their kids; there’ll be a bullet in the asshole’s brain before he can say fuck me. Gotta agree, don’t think the kids are at risk, maybe Santos will take a run at the women, but they can handle it. Need to trust them.” Axel spoke the bitter truth, and Drake swallowed it harshly.Drake didn’t like it. Rage had too many potential victims, and Drake suddenly regretted that brothers were making families. Family had been a dream of his for years, and yet now it caused headaches. Then Drake shoved it aside ruthlessly. Yeah, they had potential victims, but life couldn’t be ruled by fear. One of theirs had already been snatched, Jett’s Amelia, and they’d saved her and would again should another child be taken. Drake had to trust in his brothers and in his close circle. The moment Drake started doubting their ability to protect what was theirs was the moment Santos won.“Onto Phoe. Woman’s organising a charity bike run between the local towns, want us to plan a route and get our associates involved. Phoe wants the Road Captain to carry a flame of hope and raise money. She’s got Stefan setting up a website for donations but wants brothers to collect on route.” Drake said, swapping his mind to his wife.“Done, I’ll organise with the other clubs; you got enough shit to deal with,” Ace said, stepping up to the plate. While Drake was not only Prez but Road Captain, Ace knew he’d a lot on his plate. “Can get old ladies and friends stationed every so far apart on the route and the older kids to collect with buckets.”“Phoe’s doing a big advertising theme in South Dakota, so should pull crowds. Stefan’s organising a big fair at Founders Park, so the route will end there. Ace get with Phoe and see what she needs and then organise it with Stefan. Don’t let that crazy fuck talk you into theme dresses or similar shit,” Drake warned, and a few smiles cracked around the table. It was well known that Phoe’s Director of Fundraising was nuts.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Hawthorne sent Davies up to check her brothers. Two’s missing,” Drake said, and Rock stiffened. Rock’s gaze shot to the rec room where Carly was curled next to Silvie on a sofa with her hand on Silvie’s belly.“Don’t tell her,” Rock warned.“You don’t tell her, my girl don’t see shit coming, she’ll get hurt,” Blaze said and held Rock’s eyes. Rock wavered.“My girl,” Rock snarled back.“Our girl, she needs to know, so she’s prepared. Carly ain’t weak, and if she’s not warned, she makes herself a target,” Blaze argued. Drake rolled his eyes; this would carry on all night. Rock would want to protect his girl, and Blaze would want her warned.“As Prez, it’s my decision. Carly gets told Rock, girl can handle herself,” Drake muttered, thinking back to Carly stabbing Lindsey’s ex-husband with a pair of shears.“Drake…” Rock argued.“No, the last thing Carly wants is to walk down the street unaware danger is lurking. Her brothers can grab Carly because she’s not paying attention, girl’s not looking. Makes Carly an easy target,” Drake said and sliced the air with his hand. Rock burned with fury for a few moments and then sank into his chair.“Carly’s just starting to heal,” Rock said.“Carly will continue to heal, but she can be alert, too. Maybe they ain’t coming for her. Who the fuck knows? Davies is tracking them, when he finds them, we’ll know, but it’s an order, Rock, tell Carly,” Drake said firmly, and Rock gave up ungracefully.◆◆◆ Rock left the inner sanctum and came straight to me. My bags and boxes had been loaded up in Jett’s pick up on Sin’s orders. Sin was determined to make his life hell as he’d knocked her up again so quickly. She winked and smiled sweetly as she held Brooke in her arms as Jett came out and glanced at her to reassure himself she was okay.“Jett’s going to blow,” I whispered, and Sin smiled smugly.“Jett shouldn’t keep knocking me up then,” Sin said. “Here, hold Brooke while I tell Jett he needs to take your shit to Rock’s place.” I looked up, surprised, as Sin dumped Brooke into my arms, and I held her close and gently touched her cheek. She was beautiful, with her father’s black hair and her mother’s blue eyes. Brooke daintily yawned and closed her eyes. Rock sat on the arm of my chair as I heard Jett curse.“Was you in on that?” Rock chuckled as he reached out a finger and stroked Brooke’s hair. Jett’s voice rose loudly. Brooke’s eyes flew open, and the tiny baby stared at Rock before offering a smile and closing her eyes again.“No, I told Sin not to,” I denied, and Rock chuckled. One muscled arm slid around my shoulders, and the second cupped my arm, holding Brooke.“Suits you,” Rock whispered in my ear, and my eyes flew to his and dropped at the heat in them. Jett stormed up and held his hand out, and Rock, smirking, placed a set of keys in his hand.“Just dump it in the front room,” Rock smirked, and Jett shot him a dirty look.“Ain’t a prospect, brother,” Jett said and strode away. Insult showed in every line of his body, and Blaze and Slate jeered at him. As Jett passed, both his fists shot out, and he punched each brother before leaving. Texas was howling with laughter as Slate rubbed his jaw and Blaze his eye.“Idiots won’t learn that Jett can hit with both fists,” Rock grunted and shifted me so he could seat me on his lap. I flinched and checked to see if Brooke had woken, but she was snoring gently in my arms.“Nope,” I agreed.“Darlin’, two of your brothers are missing. Hawthorne is chasing them. No need to worry but be alert,” Rock said as my body stiffened.“Are they coming for me?” I asked.“Not that we’re aware of, but Drake had Hawthorne following up to make sure you were safe. Once we track them, we’ll handle it if they’re in Rapid City,” Rock reassured me. “Want you armed, Carly; know you can shoot, so you need to be armed.”“Okay,” I said, not knowing if I could shoot one of my brothers. Then again, they’d chained me like a dog, sold my virginity, beaten and whipped me. Yeah, I could shoot those bastards.“Carly, you okay?” Rock asked, dipping his head to mine.“Of course. At least I know to be aware of them. If they come at me here, they’ll bleed,” I said firmly. Rock’s mouth twisted.“Wasn’t going to tell you, but Drake ordered it,” Rock muttered.“That would have been foolish. I fear them and what they’re capable of. But if I didn’t know they might come for me, they’d have caught me off guard, and I’d have been an easy target. Now I know those assholes are coming, and I can take measures to protect myself. Pepper spray, taser, knife, and gun. Hey, fancy shopping tomorrow?” I asked, and Rock pulled his head back.“Shit, you get excited at buying weapons, but not clothing and shoes?” Rock chuckled.“Well, yeah,” I giggled, and he shook his head.“Carly Lennon, you have hidden depths, woman.” Rock glanced up as Klutz called out for who wanted takeout. Rock called out a no, and I pouted; I was hungry.“We’re gonna hand this little lady back to her momma, and we’re going home. We’ll pick food up on the way,” Rock said as he caught Sin’s eye. She hurried over and took Brooke from me, and I called out goodbye as Rock and I left the clubhouse.“Let me guess, we’re getting tacos,” I teased. It was a well-known fact that Rock adored tacos. If takeout was on offer, Rock constantly voted for them. Rock sent me a cheeky grin, and I rolled my eyes.“Already ordered them, being delivered in half an hour,” Rock said, and I smiled. He walked over to his bike and swung up onto it, and gazed at me. “What you waiting for? Come on, Carly, time to ride.” If I needed confirmation that Rock was serious about us, this was it.Rage had a policy that no woman rode behind them unless they were their old lady. Not even bunnies one of the brothers might date, rode behind them. Other bikers may not care who rode behind them, but for Rage, it was a statement, only an old lady. Happily, I scurried over and, placing my foot on the footrest, I swung up behind Rock and shunted forward. I wrapped my arms around him and leaned my head on Rock’s back.“Get you a helmet tomorrow,” Rock grunted and throttled his bike. “Hold on tight, Carly.”Shit, I was overwhelmed when Rock hit the road on his Harley Davidson Breakout. The bike vibrated beneath me, and I felt the power in the machine creep into my bones. Riding like this was so freeing, relaxing and I felt one with the bike. Rock expertly steered us through the streets, his exhaust roaring as the sound bounced off buildings. He took me towards the outskirts of the city and turned down Nameless Cave Road.Rock approached a high electric gate and pressed a button on his bike, and the gate swung open, and Rock whizzed past. From what I remembered, several of his brothers weren’t far from here. I found it amusing that they congregated within twenty minutes of each other. For Rage, it wasn’t enough they met up at the clubhouse. Their bonds were so tight they had to live close to each other as well. With a backwards glance, I saw the gate swinging shut behind us, and Rock rode the bike up a well-maintained road and pulled up in front of a house.Whatever I’d been expecting, it wasn’t this. It was a two-storey house that had been extended a lot. The original was made of stone and had cute circular windows and an entrance set in the middle. Above that was another set of doors with a balcony overlooking the stunning countryside. To the right was a double extension, the bottom half was brick, and the top half was wood framed. And to the left was a stone and wood extension with a balcony running the entire length and disappearing around the corner. This held large windows while the other extension had smaller windows. A slate roof capped it off.“House ain’t much, was my grandparents. Think it was my great-great-great granddaddy who built the original, and then my great-grandparents added the first wing,” Rock said, pointing to the right-hand side extension. “My grandparents added the left-hand wing and the extensions out back.” I thoroughly disagreed with Rock’s version of it ain’t much. Despite its colossal size, I loved it already. The right-hand side held a porch with a giant swing and a small wrought iron table, and two chairs.I swung off the bike, and Rock followed suit. The surrounding area was overgrown, but I thought I saw remains of flower beds, and I could swear there was a pond near the house. Rock strolled towards the house and opened the door, and I flew up the two steps behind him and entered a massive room. The house was barely furnished, just an armchair and sideboard, but the room was amazing. It was painted cream and showed its beams in the walls and ceilings, and it opened straight into the roof that held two skylights, flooding the room with sunlight. I was practically vibrating in excitement, wishing to explore.“Off you go,” Rock said, giving me a gentle push. I didn’t hesitate and flew through the first door to the right. Excited, I entered another vast room with a sofa and a large screen tv. There was a black rug thrown on the floor, but nothing else. The walls were exposed brick and wood panelling, and I fell in love with the massive stone fireplace opposite the entrance. Glancing to my left, I spied two French doors and peeking through, I saw they led to a bright glass and wood sunroom.My mind busy making plans; I returned to the first room and saw several doors; I opened the one opposite the front door and found a downstairs cloakroom. The door next to that led to a small hallway, and striding down it, I discovered a snug that again was empty. I raced back out and went through the first door on the left and found Rock’s study. It was a disaster, so I quickly closed the door. The second door on the left led into the left wing, and I walked through what I thought was the dining room. There was a door at the back, but I ignored it for now and continued into the following room.This held a matching fireplace to the room in the right extension and had the plaster cut away, exposing beams. The room was completely empty, and I spied a door at the back and walked through it. This led to a set of three small rooms whose use I’d no idea, and then I discovered the kitchen and nearly sank to my knees and cried. In front of me was a masterpiece of a country farmhouse kitchen, and my eyes gazed greedily at the huge eight hob range cooker with bespoke hand-crafted cabinets. I trailed my hand over the Welsh dresser that had undoubtedly been crafted just for this kitchen.Behind me was another door, and on opening it, I discovered an additional four rooms. One was a utility, one a pantry, the third a cloakroom, and the fourth I was unsure of. This was empty but had a table and a large window with shelves on the walls and empty jars. Moonshine? Jams? I would have to ask Rock.The Welsh dresser was set into the middle of the wall, and there was a door next to it which further exploration showed it led back to the dining room. The kitchen had a dining table sat at one end, a small scruffy thing at odds with the beauty of the kitchen. Behind that was a glass wall with a door set into it. That led me back to the sunroom on the right-hand side. One part of the kitchen ceiling was glass, letting the sunlight in, while the other part was exposed beams and peering outside; I could see the balcony continued round the back of the house.Puzzled that I hadn’t found any stairs, I wandered back to the first room where I discovered a hidden door, cleverly cut into the wall and opening it I found them. I jogged up them and encountered a long landing. Heading to the far-right-hand side, I opened the doors into two bedrooms of decent size and a family bathroom before wandering back to the old part. A door opened into the master bedroom, and I shut the door because I didn’t want to invade Rock’s privacy until asked to.The left-hand side held another three bedrooms and a further bathroom. At the end of the left-hand side was another flight of stairs, and scrambling up them, I found a converted wide-open space just sitting unused. My mind scrambled for what it could be used for as I wandered back downstairs to find Rock.“Why is there no furniture?” I asked Rock when I entered the kitchen.“When my grandparents died, the house needed a mass of repairs. BlackRock was just taking off, so I let things lapse even further. A year ago, I started working on this and moved everything into storage. You’re welcome to go through it, baby, and see what you like. Grandma had good taste, but it might not be yours,” Rock said as he made sandwiches.“The house is beautiful,” I said, pulling out a stool at the breakfast bar.“Redecorated it with you in mind,” Rock said and shocked me speechless. “What? There was never a moment I wouldn’t claim you, Carly, just wanted you to spread your wings a bit. You were always mine, girl, nothing more to say,” Rock said and placed a sandwich in front of me. I ignored it as I considered his words. For a few moments, I allowed them to sink deep into my bones as I realised what Rock was saying. He’d cared for me longer than I thought, even more than I’d believed. Rock had decorated his grandparent’s home with me in mind, and I understood his reason. Rock had desired to give me a home.“Shit,” I muttered as tears snuck into my eyes. Rock had seen the real me, the one who desired a home and love. Not the scrappy shy thing I usually was, but the lost, lonely girl who wanted nothing more than to be accepted and wanted. Rock had seen more than I thought, considering I kept my past secret and tightly guarded.“Don’t stress it,” Rock said, placing a hand over mine and dropping a kiss on my forehead.“Bit hard not to, you did this for me, and I have nothing to offer you,” I said, leaning back against his hard body.“You offer me redemption, a chance at beauty, love and family. Don’t got family Carly, except my Rage brothers and kids. My blood family turned against me a long time ago, all apart from my grandparents,” Rock said, sitting, but his gaze was unfocused, lost in the past.“Are they dead?” I asked gently.“My grandparents, yes. My family no. Mom, Dad, two sisters and a brother, various aunts and uncles and cousins, are still alive. But I didn’t fit in, see, they’re rich and well to do, and I’m me. Money meant shit to me; family and a good moral compass meant more. They didn’t understand that I couldn’t get on with their fancy friends and suck up the bullshit they do,” Rock said.“Would I have heard of them?” I asked, and Rock grunted and smiled bitterly.“Am pretty damn sure you would have. My father is the Governor of Virginia,” Rock said and waited.“No way, your father is Mitchell Johnson?” I said, gasping. Mitchell Johnson was constantly in the papers pushing one agenda or another. The family were old money and elitist, from what I read.“Yeah, my name is Heath Johnson. And I was the black sheep of the family. Was kicked out to make my own way at eighteen when I rebelled and refused to follow my father into law and politics. Even worse, they’d made fuckin’ arrangements with a friend of his for me to marry his daughter when I finished college. Who the fuck does that? I was disowned and left to make my own way. So I’ve made my own way, and BlackRock Construction is doing fuckin’ well, and we lead the way in green housing,” Rock said proudly.“You are?” I asked, trying to assimilate the information.“Yeah, we are, and we’ve taken on new teams for out-of-state projects. We’re the biggest construction company in South Dakota now that deals with turning commercial buildings into housing. We also reclaim old, abandoned sites and clean them up and put affordable housing on them,” Rock said proudly.“That’s wonderful, and I imagine your family knows nothing about this?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope, not from me. I bet they got eyes on me, though,” Rock mused.“Isn’t your father going to be running for vice president?” I asked, and Rock nodded.“Yeah, which is why I wouldn’t be surprised if they had eyes on me. Can’t have my skeletons crawling out of the closet while Daddy Dearest is running his campaign. Wouldn’t surprise me if they know what I’m doing, and they try to draw me back into the fold,” Rock said and bit into his sandwich.“What will you do if they try?” I asked curiously.“Tell them to go to fuckin’ hell. Fuckers ain’t wanted me for over half my life, so fuck ‘em all. Mitchell and his family ain’t mine. They threw me away, out into the cold and if not for my mother’s parents, who’d have known what might have become of me. My grandparents were simple people. Fuck knows how they raised my mother. But they had family money, and they left it to me alongside the house. Helped me start BlackRock Construction with Apache.”“Then it’s good you had them,” I said with a small smile and took a bite of my sandwich. Flavours exploded in my mouth, and my eyes widened. “This is s’great,” I mumbled around my mouthful.“Just a basic sandwich, baby. Yeah, my grandparents were the best. They despised what my mother turned into, a snobby rich bitch who forgot the fundamentals my grandparents taught her. My sister’s married well-to-do assholes and my brother married the woman I was supposed to. None of them appear happy marriages. My grandparents weren’t even invited because they were classed as small-town hicks. Can you imagine disrespecting your parents like that?”“Not if they were good parents, no,” I agreed. Rock’s face took on an apologetic expression.“Sorry, baby,” he said.“No, don’t be. My mom did her best, but she was tired when I was born. Your grandparents sound amazing, and I wish I could have met them,” I said, smiling.“Carly, they’d have loved you,” Rock said with his own bittersweet smile.“I’m sure the feeling would have been mutual.”“Well, whatever, my mother challenged their will after grandpa died, and she couldn’t overturn it. All the money my father has, and the bitch wanted the money from my grandparents. Greed breeds greed,” Rock said bitterly.“And she didn’t like it that everything was left to you?” I suggested.“Exactly, that was the first time I’d heard from her in years, and it was to be served paperwork they were challenging the will. My siblings were insulted that they hadn’t been given a fair share. When the judge heard how my grandparents had been treated and the fact they’d tied the will up tightly, he threw it out and made them pay costs. Called them greedy to their faces,” Rock chuckled.“I bet that went down like a ton of bricks!” I exclaimed.“And then some,” Rock laughed. I enjoyed hearing him laugh. Rock was usually grim and silent. Rock was openly verbose with me, and he laughed and chuckled more easily. I wondered who else had ever seen this side of him because from my memories, even with Rage, Rock was tight-lipped.“They don’t matter, Rock; you have a family and a good one,” I said, seeking to reassure him.“Yeah, and they and you are all that matters,” Rock said firmly, and I winked at him as he smiled happily.",

They thought they’d come for a vote on the candidates.“We still got the vote,” Drake said, confirming. “Then got issues with Blaze, Santos, Dark Souls of Lucifer, and finally Phoe and Carly.” Rock’s head snapped up at the mention of Carly.“Let’s get the vote out of the way,” Ace said, nodding, his eyes flicking to the three candidates outside the inner sanctum. It took less than ten minutes for the brothers to vote. “The three are unanimous votes for prospect,” Fish stated, and Drake nodded. “Call them in here.” Fish pulled out three prospect patches for the front of their cuts and then three longer ones that went on the bottom on their cut at the back.Unlike many MC’s, Rage had candidates for a year to see if the potential prospects would fit in with the club’s ideals. Rage having once gone bad, Drake, Texas, and Fish had brought this in to ensure the club’s safety. They’d kicked three candidates, one of which had been a serial killer, leaving Rage with Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage.Every candidate did a year before being voted to prospect; once prospect, they faced two to three years before becoming a brother. Yes, it was long-winded, but if you stuck it out, it meant you were what Rage was seeking. Not like the old days where Bulldog took possibilities straight in as brothers without a vote or trial period. It was one way of keeping Rage clean.Drake watched Klutz, Gauntlet and Savage enter. Of the three men, only Klutz showed nerves. Drake understood how much the club meant to Klutz and was glad the man had received clean votes. If one brother had declined, the candidate would have had one more year to prove himself and would be gone should he fail the vote again.“Grats the three of you. Welcome to prospect. Sit and be welcome in your first time in church,” Drake said. A huge grin broke out onto Klutz’s face while Savage nodded his head in acknowledgement, and Gauntlet offered a small smile and nod to everyone.“First order of business, Blaze. Ya know that Blaze every so often feels he’s being watched. Earlier, Rosie caught someone watching. Rock, Klutz and Slick gave chase,” Drake said and nodded to Rock.“Fucker was on a Yamaha, fled as soon as we pulled out. Chased him for a while and lost him around the Sioux San Hospital. The asshole was quick off the mark, and we got held up by a fucking ambo pulling out. By the time we cleared it, asshole was gone,” Rock growled.“What you need?” Slate asked Blaze. They’d been prospects together. Drake found those that who were prospects together were incredibly loyal to one another. Their bond was stronger.“We ain’t got a sense of threat yet, but don’t like Blaze being alone,” Texas said, glancing over at Blaze.“Yeah, I feel something bad aimed at me, but not a threat. Don’t know, man, hard to explain. Without evidence, don’t want to jump the gun,” Blaze said.“Keep our eyes open and see if this fucker returns and if so, take action?” Lex suggested, and next to him, Ezra nodded.“We ain’t got nothing else to act on, so yeah, streets are silent, no one knows who’s watching Blaze. Or if Blaze has an enemy outside of Rage, which again we got nothing,” Ace said.“First sign of something wrong, you call for backup, Blaze and make sure you’re carrying at all times. Have you got a concealed licence?” Apache asked.“Yeah,” Blaze grunted. He didn’t appear outwardly worried, but Drake knew his brother was. This had been happening for a year, and no one had any idea why.“Blaze, you feel threatened, hole up and call, you hear me, boy?” Axel threatened, and Blaze said yeah again.“Santos has been seen outside Spearfish, Chance’s territory. Hellfire’s now got feelers out,” Ace said, and backs stiffened across the room. Santos owed Rage, and they planned to get their due.“Just a sighting?” Gunner asked, and Drake nodded. Gunner’s woman, Autumn, had been the last victim of Santos, and Gunner was fit to burn for the man.“Yeah, him getting in a car. Snitch saw Santos and informed Chance. Could be why we ain’t found hide or hair of him here,” Drake replied.“Will let James know,” Gunner said, and Drake nodded.“Better it comes from you. Washington has a claim as good as ours to the man, and he’s burning for blood. Rage gets Santos, Washington needs to know,” Drake said, and everyone nodded. James Washington, Gunner’s brother, had lost his closest friend, Frank, a man he called brother to Santos. Washington wanted blood and wanted it yesterday.“Autumn and I will take a ride to James tomorrow morning,” Gunner said.“Keep James informed and make sure Washington knows that goes both ways. Man may be trying to get clean, but he doesn’t act without Rage. Santos owes us too,” Drake said.“James knows,” Gunner replied.“Inglorious has heard that Dark Souls of Lucifer have reformed. The gang scattered after that shit with Silvie, but they’re hiding out again with a new Prez. Like Santos, we can’t fuckin’ trace them, but, we know now, they are working for the cunt,” Texas said, and faces gazed at him.“Tell me you’re fuckin’ joking?” Slick demanded.“Wish I could say I was brother,” Texas replied.“Santos has recruited a biker gang to hunt us? Is the man completely off his rocker?” Mac laughed.“Don’t he get how much firepower Rage can bring to the game should it go us against a gang?” Manny asked.“Why a biker gang, though?” Gauntlet asked, and everyone turned to him. “Seems distraction to me.”“Carry on,” Drake encouraged.“We’re chasing our tails, looking for the pricks. Meanwhile, Santos is getting time to get back on his feet after the showdown with Washington. Santos lost a shit load of men, so he needs time to recruit. Means we’re chasing shadows while Santos builds his strength back up,” Gauntlet explained.“Shit,” Mac growled, “crafty fucker.”“Well, we knew Santos wouldn’t go without a fight,” Manny said, and Lowrider nodded.“Yeah, and could this shit with Blaze be a distraction, too? Rage is chasing shadows with nothing concrete,” Hunter asked, and Drake sat back.“May be onto something. Rage is distracted, looking into shadows for threats when there ain’t none. And Santos is gaining time to do what he needs, and with us distracted, our attention is elsewhere,” Axel boomed.“And add to the fact Santos knows we’ll move to protect women and children, maybe we should be asking if any of them have felt watched?” Jett suggested. Every brother with an old lady suffered a sudden chill in their stomach.“All well and good us finding and claiming, but the women are at risk too,” Slate pointed out.“Fuck,” Apache groaned.“Nah, if one of those women had bad feelings, you’d know about it. They learned their lessons, ignoring Frenzy. A fuckin’ hard lesson,” Manny said, and his face tightened. Sin had been one of the women who’d felt threatened but felt unable to bring it to a brother. She may be Jett’s woman, but she was close to Manny.“That be true,” Texas said.“The kids? Would they bring it to us?” Mac pointed out.“Elder kids, yeah, anyone over ten would. Those below probably not, although fear may manifest in other ways. But Santos knows, our kids get touched, we’ll burn his family. Don’t believe the asshole is that stupid,” Lowrider said.“No? Santos handed his own father over to Rage for the sake of money,” Ace pointed out, and every brother at the table blanched.“Santos won’t touch the kids. He’s got a thing for kids being abused, asshole may traffic women, but we know Santos don’t hold with abusing them,” Lowrider said.“Wanna understand how the fuck that works,” Apache growled. “Asshole sells women who get raped and abused. But Santos don’t hold with abusing them?”“Not a single woman is ever harmed in his hands; once he’s sold them, it ain’t down to him. Or so he thinks,” Lowrider said. Lindsey had spoken of her conversation with Santos when she’d been kidnapped by him.“Spineless cunt,” Rock spat fury in his voice.“Ain’t arguing there,” Fish said.“Make sure all kids over ten understand if they feel someone watching or feel unsafe, talk to a brother. And we’ll get the old ladies to monitor the under tens. Provide a safe place for the kids to talk,” Drake said, thinking of his brood of kids. Fuck, his daughter Peyton was only a few months old, Phoe having given birth in June. And Drake would burn the city for her.“Ain’t much else we can do, can’t put a guard on every kid,” Axel said. “Keep the over tens and old ladies alert. Someone tries to take one of their kids; there’ll be a bullet in the asshole’s brain before he can say fuck me. Gotta agree, don’t think the kids are at risk, maybe Santos will take a run at the women, but they can handle it. Need to trust them.” Axel spoke the bitter truth, and Drake swallowed it harshly.Drake didn’t like it. Rage had too many potential victims, and Drake suddenly regretted that brothers were making families. Family had been a dream of his for years, and yet now it caused headaches. Then Drake shoved it aside ruthlessly. Yeah, they had potential victims, but life couldn’t be ruled by fear. One of theirs had already been snatched, Jett’s Amelia, and they’d saved her and would again should another child be taken. Drake had to trust in his brothers and in his close circle. The moment Drake started doubting their ability to protect what was theirs was the moment Santos won.“Onto Phoe. Woman’s organising a charity bike run between the local towns, want us to plan a route and get our associates involved. Phoe wants the Road Captain to carry a flame of hope and raise money. She’s got Stefan setting up a website for donations but wants brothers to collect on route.” Drake said, swapping his mind to his wife.“Done, I’ll organise with the other clubs; you got enough shit to deal with,” Ace said, stepping up to the plate. While Drake was not only Prez but Road Captain, Ace knew he’d a lot on his plate. “Can get old ladies and friends stationed every so far apart on the route and the older kids to collect with buckets.”“Phoe’s doing a big advertising theme in South Dakota, so should pull crowds. Stefan’s organising a big fair at Founders Park, so the route will end there. Ace get with Phoe and see what she needs and then organise it with Stefan. Don’t let that crazy fuck talk you into theme dresses or similar shit,” Drake warned, and a few smiles cracked around the table. It was well known that Phoe’s Director of Fundraising was nuts.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Hawthorne sent Davies up to check her brothers. Two’s missing,” Drake said, and Rock stiffened. Rock’s gaze shot to the rec room where Carly was curled next to Silvie on a sofa with her hand on Silvie’s belly.“Don’t tell her,” Rock warned.“You don’t tell her, my girl don’t see shit coming, she’ll get hurt,” Blaze said and held Rock’s eyes. Rock wavered.“My girl,” Rock snarled back.“Our girl, she needs to know, so she’s prepared. Carly ain’t weak, and if she’s not warned, she makes herself a target,” Blaze argued. Drake rolled his eyes; this would carry on all night. Rock would want to protect his girl, and Blaze would want her warned.“As Prez, it’s my decision. Carly gets told Rock, girl can handle herself,” Drake muttered, thinking back to Carly stabbing Lindsey’s ex-husband with a pair of shears.“Drake…” Rock argued.“No, the last thing Carly wants is to walk down the street unaware danger is lurking. Her brothers can grab Carly because she’s not paying attention, girl’s not looking. Makes Carly an easy target,” Drake said and sliced the air with his hand. Rock burned with fury for a few moments and then sank into his chair.“Carly’s just starting to heal,” Rock said.“Carly will continue to heal, but she can be alert, too. Maybe they ain’t coming for her. Who the fuck knows? Davies is tracking them, when he finds them, we’ll know, but it’s an order, Rock, tell Carly,” Drake said firmly, and Rock gave up ungracefully.◆◆◆ Rock left the inner sanctum and came straight to me. My bags and boxes had been loaded up in Jett’s pick up on Sin’s orders. Sin was determined to make his life hell as he’d knocked her up again so quickly. She winked and smiled sweetly as she held Brooke in her arms as Jett came out and glanced at her to reassure himself she was okay.“Jett’s going to blow,” I whispered, and Sin smiled smugly.“Jett shouldn’t keep knocking me up then,” Sin said. “Here, hold Brooke while I tell Jett he needs to take your shit to Rock’s place.” I looked up, surprised, as Sin dumped Brooke into my arms, and I held her close and gently touched her cheek. She was beautiful, with her father’s black hair and her mother’s blue eyes. Brooke daintily yawned and closed her eyes. Rock sat on the arm of my chair as I heard Jett curse.“Was you in on that?” Rock chuckled as he reached out a finger and stroked Brooke’s hair. Jett’s voice rose loudly. Brooke’s eyes flew open, and the tiny baby stared at Rock before offering a smile and closing her eyes again.“No, I told Sin not to,” I denied, and Rock chuckled. One muscled arm slid around my shoulders, and the second cupped my arm, holding Brooke.“Suits you,” Rock whispered in my ear, and my eyes flew to his and dropped at the heat in them. Jett stormed up and held his hand out, and Rock, smirking, placed a set of keys in his hand.“Just dump it in the front room,” Rock smirked, and Jett shot him a dirty look.“Ain’t a prospect, brother,” Jett said and strode away. Insult showed in every line of his body, and Blaze and Slate jeered at him. As Jett passed, both his fists shot out, and he punched each brother before leaving. Texas was howling with laughter as Slate rubbed his jaw and Blaze his eye.“Idiots won’t learn that Jett can hit with both fists,” Rock grunted and shifted me so he could seat me on his lap. I flinched and checked to see if Brooke had woken, but she was snoring gently in my arms.“Nope,” I agreed.“Darlin’, two of your brothers are missing. Hawthorne is chasing them. No need to worry but be alert,” Rock said as my body stiffened.“Are they coming for me?” I asked.“Not that we’re aware of, but Drake had Hawthorne following up to make sure you were safe. Once we track them, we’ll handle it if they’re in Rapid City,” Rock reassured me. “Want you armed, Carly; know you can shoot, so you need to be armed.”“Okay,” I said, not knowing if I could shoot one of my brothers. Then again, they’d chained me like a dog, sold my virginity, beaten and whipped me. Yeah, I could shoot those bastards.“Carly, you okay?” Rock asked, dipping his head to mine.“Of course. At least I know to be aware of them. If they come at me here, they’ll bleed,” I said firmly. Rock’s mouth twisted.“Wasn’t going to tell you, but Drake ordered it,” Rock muttered.“That would have been foolish. I fear them and what they’re capable of. But if I didn’t know they might come for me, they’d have caught me off guard, and I’d have been an easy target. Now I know those assholes are coming, and I can take measures to protect myself. Pepper spray, taser, knife, and gun. Hey, fancy shopping tomorrow?” I asked, and Rock pulled his head back.“Shit, you get excited at buying weapons, but not clothing and shoes?” Rock chuckled.“Well, yeah,” I giggled, and he shook his head.“Carly Lennon, you have hidden depths, woman.” Rock glanced up as Klutz called out for who wanted takeout. Rock called out a no, and I pouted; I was hungry.“We’re gonna hand this little lady back to her momma, and we’re going home. We’ll pick food up on the way,” Rock said as he caught Sin’s eye. She hurried over and took Brooke from me, and I called out goodbye as Rock and I left the clubhouse.“Let me guess, we’re getting tacos,” I teased. It was a well-known fact that Rock adored tacos. If takeout was on offer, Rock constantly voted for them. Rock sent me a cheeky grin, and I rolled my eyes.“Already ordered them, being delivered in half an hour,” Rock said, and I smiled. He walked over to his bike and swung up onto it, and gazed at me. “What you waiting for? Come on, Carly, time to ride.” If I needed confirmation that Rock was serious about us, this was it.Rage had a policy that no woman rode behind them unless they were their old lady. Not even bunnies one of the brothers might date, rode behind them. Other bikers may not care who rode behind them, but for Rage, it was a statement, only an old lady. Happily, I scurried over and, placing my foot on the footrest, I swung up behind Rock and shunted forward. I wrapped my arms around him and leaned my head on Rock’s back.“Get you a helmet tomorrow,” Rock grunted and throttled his bike. “Hold on tight, Carly.”Shit, I was overwhelmed when Rock hit the road on his Harley Davidson Breakout. The bike vibrated beneath me, and I felt the power in the machine creep into my bones. Riding like this was so freeing, relaxing and I felt one with the bike. Rock expertly steered us through the streets, his exhaust roaring as the sound bounced off buildings. He took me towards the outskirts of the city and turned down Nameless Cave Road.Rock approached a high electric gate and pressed a button on his bike, and the gate swung open, and Rock whizzed past. From what I remembered, several of his brothers weren’t far from here. I found it amusing that they congregated within twenty minutes of each other. For Rage, it wasn’t enough they met up at the clubhouse. Their bonds were so tight they had to live close to each other as well. With a backwards glance, I saw the gate swinging shut behind us, and Rock rode the bike up a well-maintained road and pulled up in front of a house.Whatever I’d been expecting, it wasn’t this. It was a two-storey house that had been extended a lot. The original was made of stone and had cute circular windows and an entrance set in the middle. Above that was another set of doors with a balcony overlooking the stunning countryside. To the right was a double extension, the bottom half was brick, and the top half was wood framed. And to the left was a stone and wood extension with a balcony running the entire length and disappearing around the corner. This held large windows while the other extension had smaller windows. A slate roof capped it off.“House ain’t much, was my grandparents. Think it was my great-great-great granddaddy who built the original, and then my great-grandparents added the first wing,” Rock said, pointing to the right-hand side extension. “My grandparents added the left-hand wing and the extensions out back.” I thoroughly disagreed with Rock’s version of it ain’t much. Despite its colossal size, I loved it already. The right-hand side held a porch with a giant swing and a small wrought iron table, and two chairs.I swung off the bike, and Rock followed suit. The surrounding area was overgrown, but I thought I saw remains of flower beds, and I could swear there was a pond near the house. Rock strolled towards the house and opened the door, and I flew up the two steps behind him and entered a massive room. The house was barely furnished, just an armchair and sideboard, but the room was amazing. It was painted cream and showed its beams in the walls and ceilings, and it opened straight into the roof that held two skylights, flooding the room with sunlight. I was practically vibrating in excitement, wishing to explore.“Off you go,” Rock said, giving me a gentle push. I didn’t hesitate and flew through the first door to the right. Excited, I entered another vast room with a sofa and a large screen tv. There was a black rug thrown on the floor, but nothing else. The walls were exposed brick and wood panelling, and I fell in love with the massive stone fireplace opposite the entrance. Glancing to my left, I spied two French doors and peeking through, I saw they led to a bright glass and wood sunroom.My mind busy making plans; I returned to the first room and saw several doors; I opened the one opposite the front door and found a downstairs cloakroom. The door next to that led to a small hallway, and striding down it, I discovered a snug that again was empty. I raced back out and went through the first door on the left and found Rock’s study. It was a disaster, so I quickly closed the door. The second door on the left led into the left wing, and I walked through what I thought was the dining room. There was a door at the back, but I ignored it for now and continued into the following room.This held a matching fireplace to the room in the right extension and had the plaster cut away, exposing beams. The room was completely empty, and I spied a door at the back and walked through it. This led to a set of three small rooms whose use I’d no idea, and then I discovered the kitchen and nearly sank to my knees and cried. In front of me was a masterpiece of a country farmhouse kitchen, and my eyes gazed greedily at the huge eight hob range cooker with bespoke hand-crafted cabinets. I trailed my hand over the Welsh dresser that had undoubtedly been crafted just for this kitchen.Behind me was another door, and on opening it, I discovered an additional four rooms. One was a utility, one a pantry, the third a cloakroom, and the fourth I was unsure of. This was empty but had a table and a large window with shelves on the walls and empty jars. Moonshine? Jams? I would have to ask Rock.The Welsh dresser was set into the middle of the wall, and there was a door next to it which further exploration showed it led back to the dining room. The kitchen had a dining table sat at one end, a small scruffy thing at odds with the beauty of the kitchen. Behind that was a glass wall with a door set into it. That led me back to the sunroom on the right-hand side. One part of the kitchen ceiling was glass, letting the sunlight in, while the other part was exposed beams and peering outside; I could see the balcony continued round the back of the house.Puzzled that I hadn’t found any stairs, I wandered back to the first room where I discovered a hidden door, cleverly cut into the wall and opening it I found them. I jogged up them and encountered a long landing. Heading to the far-right-hand side, I opened the doors into two bedrooms of decent size and a family bathroom before wandering back to the old part. A door opened into the master bedroom, and I shut the door because I didn’t want to invade Rock’s privacy until asked to.The left-hand side held another three bedrooms and a further bathroom. At the end of the left-hand side was another flight of stairs, and scrambling up them, I found a converted wide-open space just sitting unused. My mind scrambled for what it could be used for as I wandered back downstairs to find Rock.“Why is there no furniture?” I asked Rock when I entered the kitchen.“When my grandparents died, the house needed a mass of repairs. BlackRock was just taking off, so I let things lapse even further. A year ago, I started working on this and moved everything into storage. You’re welcome to go through it, baby, and see what you like. Grandma had good taste, but it might not be yours,” Rock said as he made sandwiches.“The house is beautiful,” I said, pulling out a stool at the breakfast bar.“Redecorated it with you in mind,” Rock said and shocked me speechless. “What? There was never a moment I wouldn’t claim you, Carly, just wanted you to spread your wings a bit. You were always mine, girl, nothing more to say,” Rock said and placed a sandwich in front of me. I ignored it as I considered his words. For a few moments, I allowed them to sink deep into my bones as I realised what Rock was saying. He’d cared for me longer than I thought, even more than I’d believed. Rock had decorated his grandparent’s home with me in mind, and I understood his reason. Rock had desired to give me a home.“Shit,” I muttered as tears snuck into my eyes. Rock had seen the real me, the one who desired a home and love. Not the scrappy shy thing I usually was, but the lost, lonely girl who wanted nothing more than to be accepted and wanted. Rock had seen more than I thought, considering I kept my past secret and tightly guarded.“Don’t stress it,” Rock said, placing a hand over mine and dropping a kiss on my forehead.“Bit hard not to, you did this for me, and I have nothing to offer you,” I said, leaning back against his hard body.“You offer me redemption, a chance at beauty, love and family. Don’t got family Carly, except my Rage brothers and kids. My blood family turned against me a long time ago, all apart from my grandparents,” Rock said, sitting, but his gaze was unfocused, lost in the past.“Are they dead?” I asked gently.“My grandparents, yes. My family no. Mom, Dad, two sisters and a brother, various aunts and uncles and cousins, are still alive. But I didn’t fit in, see, they’re rich and well to do, and I’m me. Money meant shit to me; family and a good moral compass meant more. They didn’t understand that I couldn’t get on with their fancy friends and suck up the bullshit they do,” Rock said.“Would I have heard of them?” I asked, and Rock grunted and smiled bitterly.“Am pretty damn sure you would have. My father is the Governor of Virginia,” Rock said and waited.“No way, your father is Mitchell Johnson?” I said, gasping. Mitchell Johnson was constantly in the papers pushing one agenda or another. The family were old money and elitist, from what I read.“Yeah, my name is Heath Johnson. And I was the black sheep of the family. Was kicked out to make my own way at eighteen when I rebelled and refused to follow my father into law and politics. Even worse, they’d made fuckin’ arrangements with a friend of his for me to marry his daughter when I finished college. Who the fuck does that? I was disowned and left to make my own way. So I’ve made my own way, and BlackRock Construction is doing fuckin’ well, and we lead the way in green housing,” Rock said proudly.“You are?” I asked, trying to assimilate the information.“Yeah, we are, and we’ve taken on new teams for out-of-state projects. We’re the biggest construction company in South Dakota now that deals with turning commercial buildings into housing. We also reclaim old, abandoned sites and clean them up and put affordable housing on them,” Rock said proudly.“That’s wonderful, and I imagine your family knows nothing about this?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope, not from me. I bet they got eyes on me, though,” Rock mused.“Isn’t your father going to be running for vice president?” I asked, and Rock nodded.“Yeah, which is why I wouldn’t be surprised if they had eyes on me. Can’t have my skeletons crawling out of the closet while Daddy Dearest is running his campaign. Wouldn’t surprise me if they know what I’m doing, and they try to draw me back into the fold,” Rock said and bit into his sandwich.“What will you do if they try?” I asked curiously.“Tell them to go to fuckin’ hell. Fuckers ain’t wanted me for over half my life, so fuck ‘em all. Mitchell and his family ain’t mine. They threw me away, out into the cold and if not for my mother’s parents, who’d have known what might have become of me. My grandparents were simple people. Fuck knows how they raised my mother. But they had family money, and they left it to me alongside the house. Helped me start BlackRock Construction with Apache.”“Then it’s good you had them,” I said with a small smile and took a bite of my sandwich. Flavours exploded in my mouth, and my eyes widened. “This is s’great,” I mumbled around my mouthful.“Just a basic sandwich, baby. Yeah, my grandparents were the best. They despised what my mother turned into, a snobby rich bitch who forgot the fundamentals my grandparents taught her. My sister’s married well-to-do assholes and my brother married the woman I was supposed to. None of them appear happy marriages. My grandparents weren’t even invited because they were classed as small-town hicks. Can you imagine disrespecting your parents like that?”“Not if they were good parents, no,” I agreed. Rock’s face took on an apologetic expression.“Sorry, baby,” he said.“No, don’t be. My mom did her best, but she was tired when I was born. Your grandparents sound amazing, and I wish I could have met them,” I said, smiling.“Carly, they’d have loved you,” Rock said with his own bittersweet smile.“I’m sure the feeling would have been mutual.”“Well, whatever, my mother challenged their will after grandpa died, and she couldn’t overturn it. All the money my father has, and the bitch wanted the money from my grandparents. Greed breeds greed,” Rock said bitterly.“And she didn’t like it that everything was left to you?” I suggested.“Exactly, that was the first time I’d heard from her in years, and it was to be served paperwork they were challenging the will. My siblings were insulted that they hadn’t been given a fair share. When the judge heard how my grandparents had been treated and the fact they’d tied the will up tightly, he threw it out and made them pay costs. Called them greedy to their faces,” Rock chuckled.“I bet that went down like a ton of bricks!” I exclaimed.“And then some,” Rock laughed. I enjoyed hearing him laugh. Rock was usually grim and silent. Rock was openly verbose with me, and he laughed and chuckled more easily. I wondered who else had ever seen this side of him because from my memories, even with Rage, Rock was tight-lipped.“They don’t matter, Rock; you have a family and a good one,” I said, seeking to reassure him.“Yeah, and they and you are all that matters,” Rock said firmly, and I winked at him as he smiled happily.",

There was no mistaking that voice, and I gazed into the ruddy face and blurry weak blue eyes of Barney. He was filthy, his beard matted, and his clothes smelt of smoke and booze.“Go away, Barney,” I said, my shoulders straightening. Barney stepped towards me, and I glanced around, seeking help.Two weeks had passed since I’d moved into Rock’s, and life had been heavenly. Rock hadn’t yet made a move to consummate our relationship, but there had been lots of heavy petting and exploring. Still, Rock was sticking to his guns on dating. I’d returned to work this week after allowing Lindsey to pay me two weeks of sick pay. And I’d gained enough weight that Rock was happy for me to return to Made by Rage.The past few weeks had been filled with long bike rides and picnics. We’d been to several restaurants, although we returned to Bernard’s as our favourite. But reality bit. Rock had to run BlackRock Construction, and I needed to earn a wage. Shyly, I’d reacquainted myself with the new girls, Addison and Paisley, and settled back into my role as Lindsey’s main helper. Lindsey had been over the moon to welcome me back. Between us, we decided as there were five of us, we’d take one day each a week to fetch lunch and snacks. Today was Wednesday, and my turn to bring lunch. I was carrying a box with food orders for the girls and Gunner, who was in his part of Made by Rage. Plus, Slick and Gauntlet, who was in the shop today.“Ya need to come home, sister,” Barney sneered, and I gazed at him. Barney’s beer belly stretched his dirty white wife-beater, and the red and black plaid shirt didn’t fasten. His jeans sagged around his waist and were ripped, although not by design.“No, I am home Barney, get lost. No way will I return to that hellhole and suffer what you did to me,” I said as I searched for a brother or someone I knew. Barney’s lip curled, and he reached out a hand and grasped me firmly.“Didn’t even wait around with decency for Pa’s funeral. Stole Pa’s car and ran off ya cunt,” Barney snarled. I stiffened as Barney’s hand tightened and knew I’d have bruises.“Want the truth?” I sneered. “I watched Dad die and didn’t save him.” Barney’s mouth flopped open, and his breath was rank and his teeth even more rotten.“Carly, you fuckin’ bitch, he was our Pa,” Barney snarled, and I shook my head.“No, he beat the shit out of me. He was no father of mine. Now fuck off, Barney, you can’t control me anymore with threats against my friends. Rage knows everything, and if you touch their women, they’ll slice you up one piece at a time,” I said. My eyes landed on Barney’s beat-up truck, and I was well aware of the danger.But even as fear rose, so did the knowledge that Rock would come for me. Barney backhanded me, and I blinked dazed and dropped the box with the food in. Anger flared, and my hand curled into a claw, and I went for him. This time I wouldn’t go meekly. Screeching, I raked my nails across Barney’s face, gouging his eyes. Barney backhanded me a second time, and I cried out. A couple of women across the street called out, and Barney began dragging me towards the beat-up truck.A hard body slammed into me, and I went down, curled into someone’s arms, and my head bounced off a hard chest. Dazed, I blinked and peered into a pair of blue eyes I didn’t recognise. Unsure whether to struggle, I glanced across as the sounds of someone throwing punches hit me. Twisting my head, I saw Dylan Hawthorne punching Barney and Barney falling to his knees. Dylan held Barney by his wife-beater as he drew his arm back again and again.“Hey, I’m Davies,” the man under me grunted somewhat cheekily, and I tried to sit up as Blaze yelled my name and ran towards me. Davies kept his arms tight around me as he belly crunched and sat upright, leaving me sat between his legs.“Carly!” Blaze yelled a second time.“There’s another in the truck,” Davies called back, and Blaze skidded to a halt, and his furious gaze turned in the direction of the roaring truck. Briefly, I caught a quick glimpse of Otis, before he pulled out into traffic. Cars screeched and swerved to avoid him. Dylan held a barely conscious Barney in one grip with a frown on his face. Sirens echoed in the distance, and I guessed the police were on their way.“Go, run,” I hissed at Dylan, who stared at me, amused.“Nuh huh, shit’s okay Carly, how you doing?” Dylan asked as a black and white skidded around the corner.“Dylan, you’ll get arrested,” I whispered as two cops got out of the car.“Hey man, hear you stopped a kidnapping,” one called, and I stared stumped as Dylan turned and winked at me.“Yeah, this is Carly Lennon, girl’s Rage. This asshole backhanded her twice and was trying to get Carly in his truck. Asshole’s been reported to Ramirez for holding Carly hostage for six months,” Dylan said, and my head twisted as I stared at him. Oh dear, I hadn’t spoken to Ramirez. Realising I was still sitting on the ground, I tried to get up, and Dylan reached out and hauled me to my feet. Davies gave a sigh of relief.“I’ll get Drake,” Davies said and leapt to his feet in a smooth move I envied. Davies jogged away as Blaze hauled me into his arms and wrapped me up tightly.“Dude, I’ll call Ramirez,” one cop said and pulled a phone from his pocket. He stepped to one side as his partner hauled Barney to his knees and handcuffed him.“We’ll need statements,” the officer said.“Yeah, no probs. Those three women were watching. Maybe they’ll give a statement too,” Dylan said, tilting his head.“Ramirez said arrest him on attempted kidnapping, and he’s on his way. I’ll talk to the witnesses,” the second officer said, returning.“Yeah, I bet you will,” the first officer said, grinning as the younger man scurried over to the women, who were quite attractive. Dylan rolled his eyes at the older cop, who rolled his right back at him.“Kids,” the older officer said and shoved Barney into the back of the black and white. The cop glanced over as Lowrider came full pelt around the forecourt corner. Anxious eyes checked me over, and Lowrider glanced at Made by Rage, where his wife worked. Lindsey and everyone else was plastered to the front windows, with Gunner firmly planted in front of the door, preventing them from leaving. Drake arrived from behind Lowrider, and his eyes took in the scene.“You clear?” Drake asked Dylan, who nodded.“Yeah, all good. Got one of Carly’s brothers, the other fled. Davies had eyes on them, and when they moved in this direction, Davies called for backup. I was closest.” Drake peered into the cop car and snorted at the bloody and bruised face that stared back.“Seems he met some trouble,” Drake commented and strolled over and ran a hand over my face. “Rock’s gonna kill someone.”“But I’m okay. I scratched his eyes,” I said, not wanting Drake to think I was weak. Drake turned to me and cocked an eyebrow.“Yeah, I can see, honey; we’ll have to remind Rock about those talons of yours. Shit, I’d hate to see my brother scratched up because he stole your chocolate,” Drake drawled, and I glowed. That was high praise from Drake.I watched as Dylan and Davies gave brief statements and promised to come to the station to provide more detailed ones. The younger cop trotted back, a blinding grin on his face, and I knew he’d scored. He informed Ramirez that he’d the names and addresses of the three young women who were gazing at him from under their eyelashes. Ramirez rolled his eyes and sent the younger cop to escort Barney to the station. I broke free from Blaze’s arms and tugged on Ramirez’s jacket sleeve. He cocked his head and looked at me.“A word? In private?” I asked, and a slight frown crossed Ramirez’s face. He stepped to one side, and I went with him.“What’s up Carly,” he asked.“Tonio, I think Dylan may have made a mistake. He told the older officer that I’d given a statement concerning being held hostage for six months,” I said, worried. Nervously, I nibbled my bottom lip. Ramirez’s brown eyes softened and understanding crossed his face.“Honey, you know when you were sick? Well, you rambled, and Rock filmed it. From that, I put together a brief statement, and all it needs is your signature. It’s been documented, and an alert is out for your brothers. Rock wanted to give you time before coming down and making a more detailed one. Doc Paul has given a comprehensive statement of your injuries and health when you arrived at Rage. Dylan wasn’t wrong. There’re warrants out for your brothers,” Ramirez explained. My eyes narrowed at Blaze, who glanced away after shamelessly eavesdropping on my conversation.“There’s already been a report?” I asked.“Yeah, honey. Seriously, Carly, you didn’t think you’d return to Rage in the condition you did, and everything would be dropped?” Ramirez asked, surprised.“No, Tonio, I just wish Rock had told me and not treated me like an invalid by keeping me in the dark,” I replied. Blaze’s mouth twitched, and I thought he was annoyed.“No need to worry, Carly, you’ll need to come to the station later, bring food. You’re going to be there several hours, giving a statement about how they treated you and another about today,” Ramirez said, and I laughed.“In other words, you need feeding,” I said, and Ramirez nodded. Blaze walked over and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.“Man, I’d like to get Carly inside before Lindsey and Silvie tear Gunner apart,” Blaze said, and Ramirez glanced across at Made by Rage and winced. I turned and saw Lindsey and Silvie, both firmly planted in front of the window, with arms crossed and matching glares on their faces. Thankfully, the glares were aimed at the men stopping them from getting to me.“Ah shit, I dropped our lunches,” I hissed angrily. Blaze swooped and picked up the box.“Food’s intact, Carly, so let’s get inside,” Blaze said with a nod from Ramirez. “I’ll get Rock to bring Carly this afternoon. Let the women fuss, or you’ll be swamped with old ladies at the station.” Ramirez winced and nodded.“Sure thing, we’ll be booking Lennon, anyway. Which brother was it?”“Barney, Otis was in the truck that screeched out of here,” I replied.“We’ll get an APB out on it; we might catch him,” Ramirez said, and Blaze walked me away. Gunner stepped back from the door, and Lindsey nearly yanked it off its hinges in her haste to get to me.“Are you okay?” Lindsey screeched, and I winced and nodded.“A couple of bruises, but yeah, I’m fine, so stop stressing,” I said as Lindsey dragged me inside and began patting me over. I weakly batted at her hands and gave up as I recognised how determined Lindsey was to make sure I was okay. No sooner had she stopped then Silvie was there, jerking my face one way and another and then checking me over too. Meekly I stood and let them reassure themselves I wasn’t badly hurt, although my face felt swollen.“Sit, I’ll make coffee,” Silvie ordered.“Blaze has lunch,” I said as Lindsey pushed me through the wooden barriers that separated the reception from the workshop.“Good, we’ll feed you up, and I’ll call Sin and place another order to be dropped off. If you’re going to the station, no doubt Ramirez and Ben will want food,” Lindsey replied.Paisley hovered nearby as Addison sorted through the packages in the box and carried Slicks and Gauntlets. Gunner remained by the door, so Paisley handed him his order and Gunner hooked Silvie’s chair and sat behind her desk. Blaze turned the sign to closed and tapped on his phone. Fifteen minutes later, Reid, Sin’s brother, knocked on the door and handed a bag through to Blaze. Blaze grunted thanks, and Reid checked me over and left. No doubt reporting back to Sin.I spent the next fifteen minutes reassuring everyone I was okay. Please just let me eat, I silently begged because to ignore Penny’s food was a crime. Half an hour after Barney had first grabbed me, Rock’s bike thundered down the street and skidded to a halt in front of the shop. He swung off it, his body tight, and stomped into the shop. As soon as Rock appeared, Gunner and Blaze disappeared.“Okay?” Rock grunted, his eyes taking in the scene. I was sitting in my armchair with Lindsey next to me in hers. Silvie perched on the arm of mine, holding ice to my face, and Paisley was sat opposite me. Addison was squatting on the arm of Lindsey’s chair, and I was surrounded by clucky hens. Helplessly I made big eyes at Rock, begging him for help.“Yeah, I’m okay,” I said as Rock’s gaze landed on my swollen and now bruised cheek and split lip. I’d not discovered that until I bit into my sandwich.“Ramirez said to bring you as soon as you’re ready. Your asshole brother is at the hospital. Carly, you did damage to his right eye, girl,” Rock said with more than a hint of pride.“Good,” I muttered.“Mind if I have my woman?” Rock asked, sensing that the women were more than ready to defend me from any perceived threat. Even against Rock. They swapped glances as I hid a grin, and I shoved my way up and launched myself into Rock’s arms.“Rock, I stood up to Barney; instead of giving in, I attacked,” I cried as Rock’s arms wrapped around me tightly. One large hand rubbed my back and soothed me.“Baby, you did good. You didn’t let Barney get you in the truck, and you stopped him long enough for help to reach you. Hawthorne says you were like a lioness,” Rock murmured. I puffed up with pride. I loved hearing that. Several revelations had hit me once I got back to the shop.The first was my brothers may hurt me, but I could hurt them right back. Barney being at the hospital proved that. Second, although I’d felt fear, I hadn’t been paralysed by it, not like when they’d held me for six months. The third was that I was willing to fight to keep my life as it was. I’d every right to be happy and make my own decisions. My brothers didn’t have the right to deny me those choices. They may try to, but they couldn’t if I was ready to fight. Finally, I had pride in my actions. Pride had been beaten out of me, and I thought it was gone. But I was proud of my efforts standing up to them. They were nothing but nasty, evil bullies.“Carly?” Rock muttered as my emotions flittered across my face.“Honestly, I’m okay, Rock,” I said and snuggled into his chest. Rock squeezed me tighter and relaxed his arms, and I drew in his musky, spicy scent and let his love warm me.“Fuck, my heart skipped a fuckin’ beat when Blaze called. Good job, Dylan had got you,” Rock muttered.“I thought Dylan was going to kill Barney,” I said and shuddered. Not because of the dark thought of Barney being killed. I was ambivalent about Barney’s death and considered it a possible blessing. But the idea of Dylan being charged with murder horrified me.“Nah, the man has control, but Hawthorne enjoyed giving the asshole a beat down,” Rock smiled tightly.“I’m so sorry,” I said, and Rock squeezed me, knocking the air from my lungs.“Ain’t your fault, baby. Guessed your brothers weren’t finished with you when you said they’d sold you.” Rock’s voice dropped to a low growl. The sentence hit me hard.“You think they’re going to keep coming for me because of that?” I asked, and Rock hesitated. “Tell me the truth; I can handle it.”“Yeah, we think they’re coming for you because if they don’t, who knows what the asshole who bought you will do. Men like that Carly, they paid for a product and want it.”“But I’m not a product,” I gasped indignantly.“To that type of man, it don’t matter; you don’t matter. Carly, you’re something he bought and paid for, and he wants you. Your asshole brother put a target on your back, but he didn’t bank on Rage being behind you,” Rock said. He let me go, and I twisted in his arms and gazed at the women who were staring silently at me.“We have your back Carly,” Silvie said quietly, and emotion welled inside of me. My hands tightened on Rock’s forearms, and he understood my silent plea.“Gonna, take Carly to the station. She won’t be back today,” Rock said, and Lindsey nodded in agreement.“Take care of her,” Lindsey ordered, and Rock grunted.“Don’t need to be told that.”“No, I don’t suppose you do,” Lindsey smiled, and Rock led me out of the door, and I called goodbyes over my shoulder. Silvie sent me a cheeky grin as the shop door shut and Rock led me to his bike.◆◆◆ Several hours later, we left the station after I signed the first statement and gave a more detailed one of my being held hostage. Then I had to give a statement about today. That one I was more cautious of giving, considering it might implicate Dylan in something. Ramirez ended up reassuring me several times that Dylan wouldn’t be charged with anything. Barney was still at the hospital, needing surgery on his eye, and I felt more than a little smug. I’d successfully defended myself.Dylan was sitting in the waiting room as we left the station, no doubt there to give his own statement. He caught me up in a loose hug and clasped forearms with Rock. They swapped a few words, and Rock steered me from the station.“Fancy checking the storage locker?” Rock asked as he swung a leg over his bike.“Hell yeah,” I said enthusiastically. As of yet, we’d not checked the furniture his grandparents had left. Rock obviously knew what the locker held, but for me, it was a whole new experience. I swung up eagerly behind him, and Rock jammed the helmet over my head. With a roar, we pulled away from the station, and I plastered myself to his back.Half an hour later, I was standing in front of a locker, shaking my head. Rock had lied! I’d expected a storage locker, not a freaking locker the size of a barn. Bewildered, I waited by the entrance as the manager switched the lights on and blinked into the vast space.“But, you said a locker,” I accused, and Rock snorted.“This is a locker; it’s one of several they rent for house clearances. BlackRock uses these a lot when we’re renovating a house. If we’ve bought a house that’s furnished, then we move everything into one of these. There’s an antique dealer that comes in and goes through everything and prices it for us. Once he’s been, there’s a reclamation expert who happens to be the other guy’s brother. After he’s done, we offer stuff to charity and then get rid of it,” Rock said. I blinked at the information.“Who manages that?” I asked.“Apache or I take turns. The next clearance is mine. We have everyone arrive on a set day,” Rock said and looked disgruntled.“You don’t enjoy doing it,” I guessed, and Rock nodded.“Nope.”“But it’s fun going through old stuff and seeing what you can salvage or what you can use to create something new,” I said, astounded. Rock and Apache loved buying old buildings and doing them up, and yet he hated the idea of reclaiming furniture.“Honey, you can keep that fun if you want it.” Rock grinned at me, and I suddenly sensed a trap closing. My mouth dropped open, and I smacked his flat belly.“You want me to do your turn!” I exclaimed. Rock pouted, and I melted.“Silvie does it for Apache,” he complained, and I giggled.“Suppose once a month won’t hurt. But I know nothing about the furniture value or antiques. I might get ripped off,” I said.“No, ya won’t. The people we use know to play fair with us. But if you wanna….” Rock said and made puppy dog eyes at me. I burst into laughter, a badass biker making puppy dog eyes. Rock grinned and dropped a kiss on my lips before spinning me around.“Go find some treasures,” Rock said and gave me a slight shove. There was a hell of a lot of furniture to check. And it was primarily antiques, but nice, good quality stuff. I rummaged around, lifting covers and peeking underneath.“Rock, most of these are wonderful high-quality items, and I’d love to place them back in the house. They’ve been so lovingly cherished,” I said, and Rock beamed.“Hoped you’d say that, I wouldn’t have gotten rid of any of it. But if you wanted modern new stuff, it was your choice, and I didn’t want to pressure you.” Rock admitted.“Rock, I’ve far too much respect for you to disrespect your feelings,” I said and squeezed his hand.“Well, why don’t I get the prospects to load up a couple of trucks this weekend and bring this lot home. Then you can sort through it and put it where you wish,” Rock said.“That sounds wonderful, Rock. Can you remember where everything belongs?” I asked, rubbing my hands together in glee.“Didn’t I say you set up the house how you want?” Rock grunted and rolled his eyes as he escorted me out. As we left, I saw boxes marked with crockery and pottery, and excitement welled. Lots of treasures to be discovered and displayed.Rock drove us to Bernard’s, and we grabbed a meal before heading to Rage. We spent more than half our time in Rock’s room there. When we entered the clubhouse, I was surprised to see only a few brothers there. Blaze, Hunter, and Slick stood near the bar. Savage and Mac played pool, and Axel and Ellen sat on a sofa heckling Mac.“Where is everyone?” I asked in an aside to Rock.“Yeah, I don’t think I’ve seen the clubhouse so empty,” Rock said, puzzled, gazing around.“Those with old ladies are at home. Gauntlet and Calamity are on patrol, and Ezra and Manny are at the bar,” Mac commented. That left Klutz, Lex and Slate. Lex strolled in, chatting to Klutz, carrying takeout.“Hey, you eaten?” Lex called, and Rock’s nose twitched as the smell of tacos wafted through the room. Rock sent me a sheepish look.“Yes, we have, but I’m sure Rock can handle a taco or two,” I laughed, and Rock nodded.“Where’s Slate?” I asked.“He’s running food to the bar for Ezra, Manny, Rooster and Pyro,” Lex said, the latter two names belonging to Rage’s brother club, Hellfire MC. Ah, that made sense. While the bar cooked basic food, it got boring night after night.“How’s your day been?” Ellen asked, snagging a plate with two tacos and coming to sit by me. I wasn’t sure how to take Ellen still, but I sensed she just wanted to be accepted, and she was friendly with a capital F. I summed up my day as Ellen nodded in places. Ellen’s eyes lit up when I described the vast locker.“Oh wow, treasure chest. I love shopping for old antiques. I have little room in my cottage, but I’d love to come and help you sort through them.” Ellen smiled and then blushed. “Sorry, I’m overstepping.” Axel sent a quick glance at his woman, and his brows come down at seeing Ellen redden. I reached over and placed my hand over hers.“Honey, I’d love help because Rock wants me to make his house a home, and I don’t know how to do that,” I said.“Do what? Make a home?” Ellen asked.“Yeah, I’ve no idea, Ellen. And I want Rock to be happy, and when he comes home, I want him to relax.”“Oh, honey, you will instinctively create a home. But I’d love to help you place items. I wonder if we can gather some brothers to do the heavy lifting?” Ellen wondered, gazing at Axel.“Already on it, prospects will be at our house Saturday. Lindsey’s giving you the day off,” Rock said, approaching with a plate of mixed rice and tacos. I rolled my eyes and winced. How Rock wasn’t as fat as a barrel, I didn’t know, but then again, I knew Rock worked out four times a week at the gym. Rock sent me a shit-eating grin and glanced up as Axel sniffed at his plate. In a smooth move, Rock twisted and protected his food from Axel while the big man glared.“You weren’t expected, fucker,” Axel boomed, and I smiled.“Don’t upset Rock, Axel,” Ellen scolded, and Axel pouted. “Carly’s letting me help organise her home.” Axel winced, and Rock and I stared at him curiously.“Prepare for a military operation,” Axel warned, and Ellen poked her tongue out.“Oh?” I asked, suddenly wary.“Well, I get a little OCD sometimes. Axel is exaggerating,” Ellen said and waved a casual hand at Axel.“Ain’t doing no such thing. Tell them, woman, what happened when you arranged my programmes from concerts I been to,” Axel said, folding his arms.“Axel, I merely put them in alphabetical order, and then I arranged them by year once done,” Ellen explained. Rock’s eyes glazed over, and I laughed.“Seriously?” I asked.“Yeah, Axel had eight programmes for Queen, seven for Metallica. You get my drift,” Ellen said superiorly.“Yeah, I’m done,” Rock said and walked away. Axel huffed and followed.“Axel’s not got over it. I also colour coded his tees, and Willow… jeez, that girl is so unorganised,” Ellen moaned. The sinking sensation in my stomach warned me Axel was correct. Ellen would organise Saturday like a military operation. However, seeing the delight in her eyes and the way her hands were rubbing together, I couldn’t back out now. Ellen was far too excited.“Maybe we should get Sin to come or Reid,” I suggested suddenly. Ellen turned a sharp gaze on me.“Why?” Ellen asked.“Because most of the furniture I uncovered was antiques. If I don’t like something, they could price it up or maybe something is valuable and may need insuring,” I said, and Ellen nodded.“That makes sense,” she said, “I’m so excited; we’re going to have so much fun Saturday!” Ellen exclaimed, and I felt it too. Her enthusiasm was catching, and I was looking forward to Saturday as well. Rock strode over and grabbed my hand, pulling me up.“Taking my girl for a moonlight ride,” he said to Ellen with a smile. Her face softened, and an aww expression crossed her face.“How sweet Rock, I always knew you had it in you,” Ellen said, patting his arm. Rock looked horrified, and I vainly stifled laughter. Rock’s image was that of a gruff, silent biker, not a romantic suitor.“It’s just a bike ride,” Rock mumbled.“No Rock, it’s love,” Ellen said and squealed as Axel tilted her chair back and planted a kiss on her lips.“Run now, I’ve got Ellen occupied,” Axel boomed, and we laughed as Rock dragged me through the clubhouse. I heard Ellen laughing as Axel dropped another kiss on her mouth, and Rock pulled me through the door and straight to his bike.",

There was no mistaking that voice, and I gazed into the ruddy face and blurry weak blue eyes of Barney. He was filthy, his beard matted, and his clothes smelt of smoke and booze.“Go away, Barney,” I said, my shoulders straightening. Barney stepped towards me, and I glanced around, seeking help.Two weeks had passed since I’d moved into Rock’s, and life had been heavenly. Rock hadn’t yet made a move to consummate our relationship, but there had been lots of heavy petting and exploring. Still, Rock was sticking to his guns on dating. I’d returned to work this week after allowing Lindsey to pay me two weeks of sick pay. And I’d gained enough weight that Rock was happy for me to return to Made by Rage.The past few weeks had been filled with long bike rides and picnics. We’d been to several restaurants, although we returned to Bernard’s as our favourite. But reality bit. Rock had to run BlackRock Construction, and I needed to earn a wage. Shyly, I’d reacquainted myself with the new girls, Addison and Paisley, and settled back into my role as Lindsey’s main helper. Lindsey had been over the moon to welcome me back. Between us, we decided as there were five of us, we’d take one day each a week to fetch lunch and snacks. Today was Wednesday, and my turn to bring lunch. I was carrying a box with food orders for the girls and Gunner, who was in his part of Made by Rage. Plus, Slick and Gauntlet, who was in the shop today.“Ya need to come home, sister,” Barney sneered, and I gazed at him. Barney’s beer belly stretched his dirty white wife-beater, and the red and black plaid shirt didn’t fasten. His jeans sagged around his waist and were ripped, although not by design.“No, I am home Barney, get lost. No way will I return to that hellhole and suffer what you did to me,” I said as I searched for a brother or someone I knew. Barney’s lip curled, and he reached out a hand and grasped me firmly.“Didn’t even wait around with decency for Pa’s funeral. Stole Pa’s car and ran off ya cunt,” Barney snarled. I stiffened as Barney’s hand tightened and knew I’d have bruises.“Want the truth?” I sneered. “I watched Dad die and didn’t save him.” Barney’s mouth flopped open, and his breath was rank and his teeth even more rotten.“Carly, you fuckin’ bitch, he was our Pa,” Barney snarled, and I shook my head.“No, he beat the shit out of me. He was no father of mine. Now fuck off, Barney, you can’t control me anymore with threats against my friends. Rage knows everything, and if you touch their women, they’ll slice you up one piece at a time,” I said. My eyes landed on Barney’s beat-up truck, and I was well aware of the danger.But even as fear rose, so did the knowledge that Rock would come for me. Barney backhanded me, and I blinked dazed and dropped the box with the food in. Anger flared, and my hand curled into a claw, and I went for him. This time I wouldn’t go meekly. Screeching, I raked my nails across Barney’s face, gouging his eyes. Barney backhanded me a second time, and I cried out. A couple of women across the street called out, and Barney began dragging me towards the beat-up truck.A hard body slammed into me, and I went down, curled into someone’s arms, and my head bounced off a hard chest. Dazed, I blinked and peered into a pair of blue eyes I didn’t recognise. Unsure whether to struggle, I glanced across as the sounds of someone throwing punches hit me. Twisting my head, I saw Dylan Hawthorne punching Barney and Barney falling to his knees. Dylan held Barney by his wife-beater as he drew his arm back again and again.“Hey, I’m Davies,” the man under me grunted somewhat cheekily, and I tried to sit up as Blaze yelled my name and ran towards me. Davies kept his arms tight around me as he belly crunched and sat upright, leaving me sat between his legs.“Carly!” Blaze yelled a second time.“There’s another in the truck,” Davies called back, and Blaze skidded to a halt, and his furious gaze turned in the direction of the roaring truck. Briefly, I caught a quick glimpse of Otis, before he pulled out into traffic. Cars screeched and swerved to avoid him. Dylan held a barely conscious Barney in one grip with a frown on his face. Sirens echoed in the distance, and I guessed the police were on their way.“Go, run,” I hissed at Dylan, who stared at me, amused.“Nuh huh, shit’s okay Carly, how you doing?” Dylan asked as a black and white skidded around the corner.“Dylan, you’ll get arrested,” I whispered as two cops got out of the car.“Hey man, hear you stopped a kidnapping,” one called, and I stared stumped as Dylan turned and winked at me.“Yeah, this is Carly Lennon, girl’s Rage. This asshole backhanded her twice and was trying to get Carly in his truck. Asshole’s been reported to Ramirez for holding Carly hostage for six months,” Dylan said, and my head twisted as I stared at him. Oh dear, I hadn’t spoken to Ramirez. Realising I was still sitting on the ground, I tried to get up, and Dylan reached out and hauled me to my feet. Davies gave a sigh of relief.“I’ll get Drake,” Davies said and leapt to his feet in a smooth move I envied. Davies jogged away as Blaze hauled me into his arms and wrapped me up tightly.“Dude, I’ll call Ramirez,” one cop said and pulled a phone from his pocket. He stepped to one side as his partner hauled Barney to his knees and handcuffed him.“We’ll need statements,” the officer said.“Yeah, no probs. Those three women were watching. Maybe they’ll give a statement too,” Dylan said, tilting his head.“Ramirez said arrest him on attempted kidnapping, and he’s on his way. I’ll talk to the witnesses,” the second officer said, returning.“Yeah, I bet you will,” the first officer said, grinning as the younger man scurried over to the women, who were quite attractive. Dylan rolled his eyes at the older cop, who rolled his right back at him.“Kids,” the older officer said and shoved Barney into the back of the black and white. The cop glanced over as Lowrider came full pelt around the forecourt corner. Anxious eyes checked me over, and Lowrider glanced at Made by Rage, where his wife worked. Lindsey and everyone else was plastered to the front windows, with Gunner firmly planted in front of the door, preventing them from leaving. Drake arrived from behind Lowrider, and his eyes took in the scene.“You clear?” Drake asked Dylan, who nodded.“Yeah, all good. Got one of Carly’s brothers, the other fled. Davies had eyes on them, and when they moved in this direction, Davies called for backup. I was closest.” Drake peered into the cop car and snorted at the bloody and bruised face that stared back.“Seems he met some trouble,” Drake commented and strolled over and ran a hand over my face. “Rock’s gonna kill someone.”“But I’m okay. I scratched his eyes,” I said, not wanting Drake to think I was weak. Drake turned to me and cocked an eyebrow.“Yeah, I can see, honey; we’ll have to remind Rock about those talons of yours. Shit, I’d hate to see my brother scratched up because he stole your chocolate,” Drake drawled, and I glowed. That was high praise from Drake.I watched as Dylan and Davies gave brief statements and promised to come to the station to provide more detailed ones. The younger cop trotted back, a blinding grin on his face, and I knew he’d scored. He informed Ramirez that he’d the names and addresses of the three young women who were gazing at him from under their eyelashes. Ramirez rolled his eyes and sent the younger cop to escort Barney to the station. I broke free from Blaze’s arms and tugged on Ramirez’s jacket sleeve. He cocked his head and looked at me.“A word? In private?” I asked, and a slight frown crossed Ramirez’s face. He stepped to one side, and I went with him.“What’s up Carly,” he asked.“Tonio, I think Dylan may have made a mistake. He told the older officer that I’d given a statement concerning being held hostage for six months,” I said, worried. Nervously, I nibbled my bottom lip. Ramirez’s brown eyes softened and understanding crossed his face.“Honey, you know when you were sick? Well, you rambled, and Rock filmed it. From that, I put together a brief statement, and all it needs is your signature. It’s been documented, and an alert is out for your brothers. Rock wanted to give you time before coming down and making a more detailed one. Doc Paul has given a comprehensive statement of your injuries and health when you arrived at Rage. Dylan wasn’t wrong. There’re warrants out for your brothers,” Ramirez explained. My eyes narrowed at Blaze, who glanced away after shamelessly eavesdropping on my conversation.“There’s already been a report?” I asked.“Yeah, honey. Seriously, Carly, you didn’t think you’d return to Rage in the condition you did, and everything would be dropped?” Ramirez asked, surprised.“No, Tonio, I just wish Rock had told me and not treated me like an invalid by keeping me in the dark,” I replied. Blaze’s mouth twitched, and I thought he was annoyed.“No need to worry, Carly, you’ll need to come to the station later, bring food. You’re going to be there several hours, giving a statement about how they treated you and another about today,” Ramirez said, and I laughed.“In other words, you need feeding,” I said, and Ramirez nodded. Blaze walked over and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.“Man, I’d like to get Carly inside before Lindsey and Silvie tear Gunner apart,” Blaze said, and Ramirez glanced across at Made by Rage and winced. I turned and saw Lindsey and Silvie, both firmly planted in front of the window, with arms crossed and matching glares on their faces. Thankfully, the glares were aimed at the men stopping them from getting to me.“Ah shit, I dropped our lunches,” I hissed angrily. Blaze swooped and picked up the box.“Food’s intact, Carly, so let’s get inside,” Blaze said with a nod from Ramirez. “I’ll get Rock to bring Carly this afternoon. Let the women fuss, or you’ll be swamped with old ladies at the station.” Ramirez winced and nodded.“Sure thing, we’ll be booking Lennon, anyway. Which brother was it?”“Barney, Otis was in the truck that screeched out of here,” I replied.“We’ll get an APB out on it; we might catch him,” Ramirez said, and Blaze walked me away. Gunner stepped back from the door, and Lindsey nearly yanked it off its hinges in her haste to get to me.“Are you okay?” Lindsey screeched, and I winced and nodded.“A couple of bruises, but yeah, I’m fine, so stop stressing,” I said as Lindsey dragged me inside and began patting me over. I weakly batted at her hands and gave up as I recognised how determined Lindsey was to make sure I was okay. No sooner had she stopped then Silvie was there, jerking my face one way and another and then checking me over too. Meekly I stood and let them reassure themselves I wasn’t badly hurt, although my face felt swollen.“Sit, I’ll make coffee,” Silvie ordered.“Blaze has lunch,” I said as Lindsey pushed me through the wooden barriers that separated the reception from the workshop.“Good, we’ll feed you up, and I’ll call Sin and place another order to be dropped off. If you’re going to the station, no doubt Ramirez and Ben will want food,” Lindsey replied.Paisley hovered nearby as Addison sorted through the packages in the box and carried Slicks and Gauntlets. Gunner remained by the door, so Paisley handed him his order and Gunner hooked Silvie’s chair and sat behind her desk. Blaze turned the sign to closed and tapped on his phone. Fifteen minutes later, Reid, Sin’s brother, knocked on the door and handed a bag through to Blaze. Blaze grunted thanks, and Reid checked me over and left. No doubt reporting back to Sin.I spent the next fifteen minutes reassuring everyone I was okay. Please just let me eat, I silently begged because to ignore Penny’s food was a crime. Half an hour after Barney had first grabbed me, Rock’s bike thundered down the street and skidded to a halt in front of the shop. He swung off it, his body tight, and stomped into the shop. As soon as Rock appeared, Gunner and Blaze disappeared.“Okay?” Rock grunted, his eyes taking in the scene. I was sitting in my armchair with Lindsey next to me in hers. Silvie perched on the arm of mine, holding ice to my face, and Paisley was sat opposite me. Addison was squatting on the arm of Lindsey’s chair, and I was surrounded by clucky hens. Helplessly I made big eyes at Rock, begging him for help.“Yeah, I’m okay,” I said as Rock’s gaze landed on my swollen and now bruised cheek and split lip. I’d not discovered that until I bit into my sandwich.“Ramirez said to bring you as soon as you’re ready. Your asshole brother is at the hospital. Carly, you did damage to his right eye, girl,” Rock said with more than a hint of pride.“Good,” I muttered.“Mind if I have my woman?” Rock asked, sensing that the women were more than ready to defend me from any perceived threat. Even against Rock. They swapped glances as I hid a grin, and I shoved my way up and launched myself into Rock’s arms.“Rock, I stood up to Barney; instead of giving in, I attacked,” I cried as Rock’s arms wrapped around me tightly. One large hand rubbed my back and soothed me.“Baby, you did good. You didn’t let Barney get you in the truck, and you stopped him long enough for help to reach you. Hawthorne says you were like a lioness,” Rock murmured. I puffed up with pride. I loved hearing that. Several revelations had hit me once I got back to the shop.The first was my brothers may hurt me, but I could hurt them right back. Barney being at the hospital proved that. Second, although I’d felt fear, I hadn’t been paralysed by it, not like when they’d held me for six months. The third was that I was willing to fight to keep my life as it was.

They were nothing but nasty, evil bullies.“Carly?” Rock muttered as my emotions flittered across my face.“Honestly, I’m okay, Rock,” I said and snuggled into his chest. Rock squeezed me tighter and relaxed his arms, and I drew in his musky, spicy scent and let his love warm me.“Fuck, my heart skipped a fuckin’ beat when Blaze called. Good job, Dylan had got you,” Rock muttered.“I thought Dylan was going to kill Barney,” I said and shuddered. Not because of the dark thought of Barney being killed. I was ambivalent about Barney’s death and considered it a possible blessing. But the idea of Dylan being charged with murder horrified me.“Nah, the man has control, but Hawthorne enjoyed giving the asshole a beat down,” Rock smiled tightly.“I’m so sorry,” I said, and Rock squeezed me, knocking the air from my lungs.“Ain’t your fault, baby. Guessed your brothers weren’t finished with you when you said they’d sold you.” Rock’s voice dropped to a low growl. The sentence hit me hard.“You think they’re going to keep coming for me because of that?” I asked, and Rock hesitated. “Tell me the truth; I can handle it.”“Yeah, we think they’re coming for you because if they don’t, who knows what the asshole who bought you will do. Men like that Carly, they paid for a product and want it.”“But I’m not a product,” I gasped indignantly.“To that type of man, it don’t matter; you don’t matter. Carly, you’re something he bought and paid for, and he wants you. Your asshole brother put a target on your back, but he didn’t bank on Rage being behind you,” Rock said. He let me go, and I twisted in his arms and gazed at the women who were staring silently at me.“We have your back Carly,” Silvie said quietly, and emotion welled inside of me. My hands tightened on Rock’s forearms, and he understood my silent plea.“Gonna, take Carly to the station. She won’t be back today,” Rock said, and Lindsey nodded in agreement.“Take care of her,” Lindsey ordered, and Rock grunted.“Don’t need to be told that.”“No, I don’t suppose you do,” Lindsey smiled, and Rock led me out of the door, and I called goodbyes over my shoulder. Silvie sent me a cheeky grin as the shop door shut and Rock led me to his bike.◆◆◆ Several hours later, we left the station after I signed the first statement and gave a more detailed one of my being held hostage. Then I had to give a statement about today. That one I was more cautious of giving, considering it might implicate Dylan in something.

As of yet, we’d not checked the furniture his grandparents had left. Rock obviously knew what the locker held, but for me, it was a whole new experience. I swung up eagerly behind him, and Rock jammed the helmet over my head. With a roar, we pulled away from the station, and I plastered myself to his back.Half an hour later, I was standing in front of a locker, shaking my head. Rock had lied! I’d expected a storage locker, not a freaking locker the size of a barn. Bewildered, I waited by the entrance as the manager switched the lights on and blinked into the vast space.“But, you said a locker,” I accused, and Rock snorted.“This is a locker; it’s one of several they rent for house clearances. BlackRock uses these a lot when we’re renovating a house. If we’ve bought a house that’s furnished, then we move everything into one of these. There’s an antique dealer that comes in and goes through everything and prices it for us. Once he’s been, there’s a reclamation expert who happens to be the other guy’s brother. After he’s done, we offer stuff to charity and then get rid of it,” Rock said. I blinked at the information.“Who manages that?” I asked.“Apache or I take turns. The next clearance is mine. We have everyone arrive on a set day,” Rock said and looked disgruntled.“You don’t enjoy doing it,” I guessed, and Rock nodded.“Nope.”“But it’s fun going through old stuff and seeing what you can salvage or what you can use to create something new,” I said, astounded. Rock and Apache loved buying old buildings and doing them up, and yet he hated the idea of reclaiming furniture.“Honey, you can keep that fun if you want it.” Rock grinned at me, and I suddenly sensed a trap closing. My mouth dropped open, and I smacked his flat belly.“You want me to do your turn!” I exclaimed. Rock pouted, and I melted.“Silvie does it for Apache,” he complained, and I giggled.“Suppose once a month won’t hurt. But I know nothing about the furniture value or antiques. I might get ripped off,” I said.“No, ya won’t. The people we use know to play fair with us. But if you wanna….” Rock said and made puppy dog eyes at me. I burst into laughter, a badass biker making puppy dog eyes. Rock grinned and dropped a kiss on my lips before spinning me around.“Go find some treasures,” Rock said and gave me a slight shove. There was a hell of a lot of furniture to check. And it was primarily antiques, but nice, good quality stuff. I rummaged around, lifting covers and peeking underneath.“Rock, most of these are wonderful high-quality items, and I’d love to place them back in the house. They’ve been so lovingly cherished,” I said, and Rock beamed.“Hoped you’d say that, I wouldn’t have gotten rid of any of it. But if you wanted modern new stuff, it was your choice, and I didn’t want to pressure you.” Rock admitted.“Rock, I’ve far too much respect for you to disrespect your feelings,” I said and squeezed his hand.“Well, why don’t I get the prospects to load up a couple of trucks this weekend and bring this lot home. Then you can sort through it and put it where you wish,” Rock said.“That sounds wonderful, Rock. Can you remember where everything belongs?” I asked, rubbing my hands together in glee.“Didn’t I say you set up the house how you want?” Rock grunted and rolled his eyes as he escorted me out. As we left, I saw boxes marked with crockery and pottery, and excitement welled. Lots of treasures to be discovered and displayed.Rock drove us to Bernard’s, and we grabbed a meal before heading to Rage. We spent more than half our time in Rock’s room there. When we entered the clubhouse, I was surprised to see only a few brothers there. Blaze, Hunter, and Slick stood near the bar. Savage and Mac played pool, and Axel and Ellen sat on a sofa heckling Mac.“Where is everyone?” I asked in an aside to Rock.“Yeah, I don’t think I’ve seen the clubhouse so empty,” Rock said, puzzled, gazing around.“Those with old ladies are at home. Gauntlet and Calamity are on patrol, and Ezra and Manny are at the bar,” Mac commented. That left Klutz, Lex and Slate. Lex strolled in, chatting to Klutz, carrying takeout.“Hey, you eaten?” Lex called, and Rock’s nose twitched as the smell of tacos wafted through the room. Rock sent me a sheepish look.“Yes, we have, but I’m sure Rock can handle a taco or two,” I laughed, and Rock nodded.“Where’s Slate?” I asked.“He’s running food to the bar for Ezra, Manny, Rooster and Pyro,” Lex said, the latter two names belonging to Rage’s brother club, Hellfire MC. Ah, that made sense. While the bar cooked basic food, it got boring night after night.“How’s your day been?” Ellen asked, snagging a plate with two tacos and coming to sit by me. I wasn’t sure how to take Ellen still, but I sensed she just wanted to be accepted, and she was friendly with a capital F. I summed up my day as Ellen nodded in places. Ellen’s eyes lit up when I described the vast locker.“Oh wow, treasure chest. I love shopping for old antiques. I have little room in my cottage, but I’d love to come and help you sort through them.” Ellen smiled and then blushed. “Sorry, I’m overstepping.” Axel sent a quick glance at his woman, and his brows come down at seeing Ellen redden. I reached over and placed my hand over hers.“Honey, I’d love help because Rock wants me to make his house a home, and I don’t know how to do that,” I said.“Do what? Make a home?” Ellen asked.“Yeah, I’ve no idea, Ellen. And I want Rock to be happy, and when he comes home, I want him to relax.”“Oh, honey, you will instinctively create a home. But I’d love to help you place items. I wonder if we can gather some brothers to do the heavy lifting?” Ellen wondered, gazing at Axel.“Already on it, prospects will be at our house Saturday. Lindsey’s giving you the day off,” Rock said, approaching with a plate of mixed rice and tacos. I rolled my eyes and winced. How Rock wasn’t as fat as a barrel, I didn’t know, but then again, I knew Rock worked out four times a week at the gym. Rock sent me a shit-eating grin and glanced up as Axel sniffed at his plate. In a smooth move, Rock twisted and protected his food from Axel while the big man glared.“You weren’t expected, fucker,” Axel boomed, and I smiled.“Don’t upset Rock, Axel,” Ellen scolded, and Axel pouted. “Carly’s letting me help organise her home.” Axel winced, and Rock and I stared at him curiously.“Prepare for a military operation,” Axel warned, and Ellen poked her tongue out.“Oh?” I asked, suddenly wary.“Well, I get a little OCD sometimes. Axel is exaggerating,” Ellen said and waved a casual hand at Axel.“Ain’t doing no such thing. Tell them, woman, what happened when you arranged my programmes from concerts I been to,” Axel said, folding his arms.“Axel, I merely put them in alphabetical order, and then I arranged them by year once done,” Ellen explained. Rock’s eyes glazed over, and I laughed.“Seriously?” I asked.“Yeah, Axel had eight programmes for Queen, seven for Metallica. You get my drift,” Ellen said superiorly.“Yeah, I’m done,” Rock said and walked away. Axel huffed and followed.“Axel’s not got over it. I also colour coded his tees, and Willow… jeez, that girl is so unorganised,” Ellen moaned. The sinking sensation in my stomach warned me Axel was correct. Ellen would organise Saturday like a military operation. However, seeing the delight in her eyes and the way her hands were rubbing together, I couldn’t back out now. Ellen was far too excited.“Maybe we should get Sin to come or Reid,” I suggested suddenly. Ellen turned a sharp gaze on me.“Why?” Ellen asked.“Because most of the furniture I uncovered was antiques. If I don’t like something, they could price it up or maybe something is valuable and may need insuring,” I said, and Ellen nodded.“That makes sense,” she said, “I’m so excited; we’re going to have so much fun Saturday!” Ellen exclaimed, and I felt it too. Her enthusiasm was catching, and I was looking forward to Saturday as well. Rock strode over and grabbed my hand, pulling me up.“Taking my girl for a moonlight ride,” he said to Ellen with a smile. Her face softened, and an aww expression crossed her face.“How sweet Rock, I always knew you had it in you,” Ellen said, patting his arm. Rock looked horrified, and I vainly stifled laughter. Rock’s image was that of a gruff, silent biker, not a romantic suitor.“It’s just a bike ride,” Rock mumbled.“No Rock, it’s love,” Ellen said and squealed as Axel tilted her chair back and planted a kiss on her lips.“Run now, I’ve got Ellen occupied,” Axel boomed, and we laughed as Rock dragged me through the clubhouse. I heard Ellen laughing as Axel dropped another kiss on her mouth, and Rock pulled me through the door and straight to his bike.",

I snatched the coffee without a second thought as Ellen breezed past me and into the house. Not functioning yet, I followed her as Ellen wandered around and finally landed in the kitchen. Ellen was opening drawers and peering in cupboards, and clucking her tongue.“What time is it?” Rock complained as he entered the kitchen wearing low-slung jeans. My mouth watered at the sight of his chest, and I fixated on it happily.“Eight o’clock, and you sound just like the prospects did when I roused them an hour ago,” Ellen chirped, and Rock and I swapped unhappy glances. Had Ellen forgot it was Saturday? I silently whined. The one day, I could have had a lay-in and be lazy. But, instead, Ellen was a cruel, cruel person who ruthlessly woke up innocently sleeping people.“Where’s Axel?” Rock grunted, reaching for the coffee.“Oh, he’s supervising the prospects. Axel’s a grumpy bear in the morning, so I thought he could work it out on them before coming here,” Ellen said, grinning. Okay, that confirmed it. Ellen was desperately cruel and evil. Ellen setting a grumpy Axel on the prospects was unadulterated evil. Blacker than black, darker than dark. Why on earth would Ellen do that to those poor prospects?“Fuckers won’t know what’s hit them,” Rock confirmed my thoughts.“Well, they’ll certainly be awake when moving your furniture. Now I plan to have everything laid out in the front yard, and then we can see what goes where. Go shower Carly and dress in old clothing. Sin’s on her way too, and she’s bringing breakfast. These were cheeky early morning snacks,” Ellen said, holding up the bag of pastries. Rock snatched it and pulled out a bear claw. He passed me a cinnamon bun, and I bit into it, happily inhaling the scent of the spice. I was a cinnamon freak. If something contained the spice, I ate it.“Jett’s coming?” Rock asked, looking hopeful.“Jett’s bringing the babies later,” Ellen said, and Rock looked crestfallen. “No getting out of work, Rock!” I snatched a second cinnamon roll and picked up my coffee, which was also cinnamon flavoured, and let Rock lead me from the kitchen. This was shaping up to be a busy, chaotic day.Three hours later, I stared at the mass of furniture spread over the front yard. There was that much of it I didn’t know where to start, and Ellen was busying herself from piece-to-piece cooing over them.“You look ever so pale,” Sin said, approaching.“Yeah, I think I underestimated the magnitude of the task ahead of me,” I said, waving a hand. Rock and Axel had taken one glance at the yard and disappeared around the back. The prospects lay on the grass looking winded.“Okay, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Then, when you open them, walk around the furniture. And when you feel an item should be placed in a certain room, shout up, and I’ll pop a post-it on it,” Ellen chirped, approaching at speed. Dubiously sending Ellen a look, I did as she ordered but took several breaths and then opened my eyes. The first thing I spied was a hand-carved cabinet and knew where it belonged.“Entrance hall, that dresser in the dining room, and that coffee table in the snug,” I said, pointing at the three things. Sin dashed over and wrote on post-its and stuck them on the furniture.“Glad we’re doing this now,” Ellen said, glancing at her phone. “The weather is predicting heavy rainfall next week.” I made a moue with my mouth. Yeah, I’d have hated moving in during that. But now I had an idea on how to label the furniture, everything went much quicker. The prospects began moving the furniture into the rooms, and within a few more hours, the yard was empty. The house, however, was a mess. I sighed because my work was not yet done. But the good news was, Rosie, Jodie and Serenity arrived, bringing a hamper of food.“Wonderful!” Ellen cried, clapping her hands together.“Willow was coming, but she’s been called into work,” Serenity said. I studied Drake’s daughters and noted the tiredness in their faces. They’d been flying back and forth ever since Harley had been put into a coma. The little bastards who’d attacked Harley had suffered huge servings of karma.“Yes, Willow said she’s just landed a case,” Ellen said with a frown.“Do we need to worry?” I asked, and Ellen shook her head.“No, this isn’t as dangerous as Willow being undercover. A simple, straightforward case Willow claims,” Ellen said, reassuring us.“That’s good. So do you want any help?” Jodie asked.“Can you afford to break a nail?” I teased, and Jodie poked her tongue out. I responded in kind, and we smiled.“Yes, I can afford to break a nail, Serenity, however, can’t,” Jodie said teasingly, and Serenity broke a piece of bread off her sandwich and threw it at Jodie.“Says the prima donna,” Serenity retorted. “Say, as you’re with Rock, you know that makes you our Aunt Carly.” I blanched as Serenity began laughing hysterically. Jodie’s eyes held a wicked glint as a slow smile crossed her face.“Don’t you even dare!” I warned Jodie, who broke into gales of laughter. A car pulled up, and Penny climbed out with Texas and their two younger children. Penny glanced around and put her fingers to her lips, and whistled. Rosie trotted over, opened the SUV trunk, and picked up a large container with bread rolls.“Hey girls, I brought food, enough for an army,” Penny called as brothers appeared from every direction and sniffed the air.“What we got, Penny?” Calamity asked, approaching at speed.“Chilli dogs, two Enchilagne and pastries,” Penny called back, and she became muffled as hulking brothers and prospects surrounded her. Moments later, Axel, Texas, Rock and the prospects carried urns and containers back. Texas didn’t appear happy, and Rosie leaned over in an aside.“Dad loves Mom’s Enchilagne, but god help us if he has to share it. Mom’s made Dad two at home,” Rosie confided.“Talk about poor communication; we bring a hamper, and Penny brings a feast,” Serenity smiled as we heard sounds of fighting coming from the backyard. Wandering around, we saw the brothers lined up in front of a table and Penny giving them a stern gaze.“Behave, I’ll serve you and then when the girls have put some aside, you may help yourself to the leftovers!” Penny warned. We watched in amusement as Penny served each brother a generous helping of Enchilagne and three chilli dogs laden with cheese and nacho toppings. Texas was balefully looking at the rapidly emptying tins and muttering under his breath.“Dad,” Rosie hissed, and Texas glanced across. “Mom saved two at home for you.” Texas’s head twisted so he could face the innocent expression Penny was offering, and he sighed.“Might have guessed, there’s no way Penny would starve her man,” Texas rumbled, and Axel snorted.“Wanna bet, Penny loves me more,” Axel teased, which didn’t go down too well with Texas.“Can you believe how they fight over food?” Ellen said, sitting with a chilli dog. Penny had covered up slices of the Enchilagne and chilli dogs for us to eat later, and the seven men in my backyard were eyeing the leftovers greedily.“Have you seen Rock when it’s the last taco?” I asked. Ellen blanched and nodded. “Like all men, they live through their stomach.”“Truthfully, it’s a wonder Uncle Ace survives. Aunt Artemis is a terrible cook,” Serenity said. Everyone who heard Serenity’s words blanched. No lie, Artemis was terrible; she’d once put Ace in the hospital trying to make a pie.“That’s why she has Mrs Humphries,” Rosie said, and we nodded.“After Artemis poisoned Ace with that peach pie, I don’t think I’ve eaten peach pie since,” Rock mused, and everyone nodded. Ace’s poisoning had been so violent none of us had eaten it since then.“Did you hear what Dad’s trying to do for Mum?” Jodie asked, and we shook our heads. “Dad wants a picture of all the kids together, from big to little, but he wants it done as a portrait. Dad’s having murder getting us together and has been banging his head against a brick wall for the last six weeks,” Jodie said, grinning.“Poor Drake,” I muttered. Having to gather eighteen kids together for a family event was a logistical nightmare. Then my thoughts turned to Harley.“Dad’s providing the artist a picture of Harley,” Serenity said, reading my thoughts. But, jeez, it was nearly a year since Harley had been attacked from behind and put into a coma. Serenity’s smiling face disappeared, and I put a hand out and touched her arm.“Harley will recover; he’s just lazy. He’s hung on this long, and they didn’t think he’d make it through the first night. Then they said twenty-four hours, and so on. Harley has fought every battle and is now being lazy, taking his time, but he will wake up,” I said fiercely, and Jodie and Serenity smiled. That shit had to be so hard for them. Their younger sibling trapped in a world Harley couldn’t escape.That was one thing I sincerely admired Phoe and Drake for. Although mainly Phoe, because Drake had only been around a short while. But they raised their kids to believe that a blood bond didn’t mean shit. Blood could easily betray one another. It didn’t matter that most of their kids were adopted. Once Phoe’s brood claimed them, they were family. And those kids stuck together through thick and thin. All of them were terrific kids, even the little ones. And Drake had taken on sixteen kids that weren’t any tie to him other than the fact they belonged to the woman he loved. And it had to be love to offer that level of commitment.After a long break, we began moving furniture around inside. Once each room was placed as I wanted, Rosie, Serenity, Jodie and Penny started dusting, cleaning and hoovering. Of course, the guys grunted and complained as they moved the furniture where I wanted it to go, bitching when I changed my mind on a placement. But by six that evening, everything was done. The bedrooms had beds in, and Klutz and Calamity had been whizzes at putting them together. The dining room held a twenty-seat long table and sideboards, all the rooms were now cosy and welcoming. And I was happier than a pig in muck as to how it had gone so wonderfully well.The prospects left first, nearly running to their bikes in haste to get away from mine and Ellen’s enthusiastic thank you’s. Jett (who’d arrived with his girls), Texas, Rock and Axel sat on the back patio gazing at the garden.“Needs an overhaul,” Axel boomed as we approached.“Yeah, Ezra has been booked in for a fortnight. Told Ezra what I want doing with it,” Rock grunted as I slid around to him. Rock hooked an arm lazily around my waist and pulled me into his lap.“Do I get to know?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope,” Rock said, popping the p in nope. “It’s a surprise and one you can keep that cute little nose out of.”“Well, I need food,” Penny said, glancing at the table where only crumbs remained. Strangely enough, every brother sat up and became alert. I swapped glances with Penny and Ellen, and we laughed.“There’s a new sushi place in town,” Serenity suggested, and the men shook their heads.“Fried chicken?” Jett suggested, and everyone nodded. The chicken place also did the best barbecue ribs ever, so I ordered a rack of them. Rock, Sin and Jodie followed suit on my idea of chicken and ribs, and Texas phoned it through and gave them the address. I wondered if we were outside of their delivery range, but as soon as Texas gave his name, it didn’t matter. I half expected they’d deliver to the next state over if it involved Rage.Jett started the firepit as Amelia settled herself on Axel’s lap, and Ellen held baby Brooke. Ellen had no children of her own, which clearly meant no grandchildren. But coming into Axel’s life, Ellen suddenly discovered an abundance of children and was in grandmother heaven. After spending the entire day with her, I saw Ellen for what she was, a kind, caring, genuine soul who had a lot of love to offer. Axel was one lucky man. When they went home, I was slightly tipsy and determined to make Rock mine that night.Rock was downstairs as I showered and dressed in a skimpy baby doll nightdress. It wasn’t something I’d usually wear, but Rock’s eyes had lit up when I held it up to him. I arranged myself on the bed, trying for a sexy pose and feeling awkward and stupid. Damn this, I was a virgin and didn’t know how to seduce the man I desired so badly. I heard footsteps and started to move when the door opened, and, blushing, I lay back and gazed into Rock’s surprised eyes.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Rock, I want to make love. Because I’m tired of waiting around for you to make a move,” I said boldly, and Rock’s eyes flared, and I saw a stiffening in his jeans.“Ah,” Rock said and gulped. That was good, right? A gulp?“Please don’t say no, please don’t refuse me,” I begged, a little ashamed. I’d put myself out there and needed Rock to meet me halfway. Rock ran a hand across his face and strolled to the bed.“Carly, I want you. Never mistake that. But there’s a reason I’ve been hesitant. Vanilla sex is great, but there’s another version that I far more prefer. And I was biding my time to let you get used to being us before introducing you to it,” Rock said quietly. My curiosity peaked. What exactly was Rock into sexually?“Dominant sex?” I asked, yeah I’d read Fifty Shades.“No,” Rock said shortly, and I could see his mind churning. “Forget it. We’ll go with vanilla.”“Rock, talk to me. I’m your girl. There’s nothing you can’t tell me,” I encouraged, and Rock dropped his head.“Well… I prefer Shibari,” Rock said, and my mind stuttered. What on earth was Shibari?“Huh?” I said, confused.“Shibari is an artistic form of Japanese rope bondage. It’s a deeply intimate form of sex because you have to trust me completely to let me practise on you. Any doubt and it becomes uncomfortable for both of us. Here look,” Rock said, dragging his phone out, and I scooted closer. Rock pulled up some pictures and showed them to me. Amazed, I stared at the intricate knots making beautiful patterns binding a woman’s arms behind her back. I flipped to the next and blushed as I saw a woman’s torso bound and her breasts tied.“You practise this?” I asked, swiping again and studying another.“Yeah, I do, took classes with Lex. We both became adept at Shibari. Shibari is far different from normal bondage. I get aroused by the trust you place in me when I tie you. Normal bondage is about restraining you, Shibari is about freeing you. Even the ropes differ. Shibari uses natural fibres, while normal bondage uses hemp, polycotton or nylon. The natural fibres in Shibari ropes add to the arousal of yourself,” Rock said earnestly, explaining. I was stunned. I’d never have believed Rock was into this. Yet, I was aroused. The thought of trusting Rock completely and putting myself in his hands caused a trickle of sensation between my legs.“So Shibari isn’t about restraint?” I asked.“No, look, see how her torso is bound, but her arms and legs are free. Shibari is about you trusting me to be intimate with your body and allowing me to bind you. Shibari can cause some pain depending on the practitioner, but I only cause pleasurable pain with it. I don’t like to cause pain for the sake of it. Done correctly, the pain caused by Shibari should always be pleasurable,” Rock explained.“Go on,” I said quietly, listening.“For me, each tie, each knot means something; it places you fully in my hands. It’s not meant to be degrading or violent. Shibari’s about pleasure, allowing me to touch you and share intimacy together. There’s different thickness in ropes, and sometimes you can use silk to caress the skin, making the experience more pleasure. The sensation of the rope and ties make your skin more sensitive. You receive pleasure in your own submission and trust. With every knot I tie, I feel your surrender, and it’s terribly empowering,” Rock said, his hands dangling loosely on his knees.“And this arouses you?” I asked, needing to know.“More than vanilla or BDSM? Yes, Shibari arouses me painfully,” Rock admitted.“Where would you tie me?” I asked, needing to know.“To start, I wouldn’t bind your arms together or anything straight away. We could start with wrapping one arm and moving across your chest here.” Rock stroked the skin above my breasts. “And then bind the other arm. You would be free to move and stop me if needed,” Rock said, his eyes alert.“I’m okay with that,” I said, and before Rock could say anything, I gathered my courage and pulled my nightie off. Rock’s eyes flared as he gazed at my body, and he swallowed hard.“Fuck, I’ve seen you naked before, but this time is different,” Rock said and took my mouth in a deep kiss. He broke it off and rolled off the bed and got to his knees, and pulled a box out from under the bed. I peered over as Rock opened it, and I saw coloured rope inside it.“Feel this Carly, it’s the one I intend you use.” I reached out and touched the blue rope; it was silky and smooth. But it was rather thick, and that worried me. So I peered into the box and saw thinner ropes.“Why not them?” I asked.“The thinner the rope, the more intense. The thinness puts pressure on your skin and pressure points, so a thick rope is the best to start with. Thin rope used wrongly can bite into your skin, and as a beginner, you may struggle, hurting yourself. Thick rope introduces you to the act of Shibari,” Rock explained.“Okay, so what do I do?” I asked.“Stand up and let me love you,” Rock replied. Taking a deep breath, I stood up in front of Rock as his eyes drank in my body.“As I tie you, I’ll touch and kiss your skin,” Rock said, unwrapping the rope. Rock stripped and dumped his clothes as I took in his hard, muscled body. “I want you to see the effect you have on me as I can feel the effect I have on you.” Gently Rock took my hand, and standing in front of me, placed it on his chest. I swallowed hard as Rock draped the rope around me, letting my skin become used to the sensation. Gently Rock started to tie and make knots, and I shivered under his hands and mouth. With each knot Rock tied, he dropped a kiss on the skin just below.Slowly Rock worked his way up my arm, his gaze focused and intent on the act of tying. His cock was so hard, I thought it would break. As Rock stepped closer, his cock pressed against my stomach, and a moan left my mouth. Wetness pooled between my legs, and I ached for his touch.I lost myself in Rock’s world, entirely under his control and ready to obey anything he commanded. Once my arm was done, Rock took another length of rope and bound my other arm. I didn’t know if I could wait for Rock to bind my chest, as desire was all I could think of. That and Rock’s hot mouth caressing my skin in featherlight touches. I stared at my arms intricately bound and yet at the same time a simple pattern. The knots looked beautiful, and I admired Rock’s skill. Rock’s breathing had changed halfway to finishing my first arm, and now as he stepped back, his unsteady breathing turned to panting.Concentration on his face, Rock unravelled the third rope and began binding above my chest, resting on my collar bones but not near my neck. I could barely stand. Rock was right. This was so intense, I trusted Rock to pull the ropes tightly but not hurt me. Aroused, I allowed Rock to bind my chest but leave me free to back away if needed. Featherlight touches aroused my skin until it almost became torturous, and I understood the painful pleasure Rock had spoken of.When he was done, Rock stepped back and stared at me. His cock was twitching and wet at the top, nipples hard and sacs drawn up tightly. My own nipples were tight little bullets, and my breasts a flushed pink. Between my legs, I was so wet it was painful. Rock took my hand and led me to the bed. Carefully, Rock laid me down, and I wondered what to do. Rock arranged my legs and knelt between them. His face was tight with desire, and slowly Rock lifted my arms above my head, the action drawing my breasts higher, and nodded. Rock bent down and took a nipple in his mouth, one hand caressing the knots on my arm.A cry left my lips as Rock’s hot wet mouth sucked my nipple hard, and Rock ran his fingers down the knots, and my skin reacted sensitively. My head dropped back to the pillows as Rock reluctantly dragged his mouth from my nipple and swooped on the other. My hips moved wildly, my body telling me what it needed, although I wasn’t experienced. Rock shuffled up, and my legs clamped around one of his knees. I gasped as I realised I could move, and the friction of Rock’s skin on my wet pussy made me cry again.“Rock,” I gasped. Rock broke off from my nipple and leant on his arms as he drew in deep, ragged breaths.“It’s okay, baby,” Rock said, kissing me and his hand stroked my skin. The world was on fire. Every nerve was electrified, and I needed release. My pussy spasmed against his skin, and Rock shuffled down the bed and dropped between my legs. Rock kissed each thigh, and he gently put my legs over his shoulders. Cold air slapped against my clit as he opened my folds, and I let out a tortured cry.“Let go, baby,” Rock muttered and dipped his head between my legs. The first touch of his tongue sent my hips thrusting up as I screamed. The second touch drowned me in sensation, and I gave over to my body’s demands. Wild cries left my lips as my hips thrust against his mouth, and Rock held my ass cheeks, lifting me up and helping me grind against him. Finally, with a strangled scream, I exploded and collapsed on the bed.“I’m going to enter you, Carly. Baby, I can’t last any longer,” Rock said, his huge body rising above me. I nodded weakly, unable to answer, and Rock gathered my hands above my head and held them in one hand. Slowly, his cock prodded my entrance, and Rock fed himself into me. The empty sensation I’d suffered disappeared as his huge cock filled me. Rock hit the barrier of my virginity and paused.“Will it hurt?” I mumbled, holding his gaze.“Somewhat,” Rock murmured regretfully and thrust through the barrier. My pained cry broke out, and Rock kissed me deeply, drawing my cry into his mouth. Rock’s body was tense and solid as he held himself still to allow me to adjust to his size. My first reaction had been to buck Rock off and fight him, but slowly I relaxed, and my pussy held him tight. Rock shifted and seated himself fully in me, and the emptiness finally disappeared.“So fuckin’ tight,” Rock growled and withdrew and pushed back in slowly. I winced as pain pinched again, and then it was gone. I wriggled my hips and moved tentatively with him, and Rock hissed.“Wrap your legs around me, baby,” Rock demanded, and I obeyed, feeling him slide even deeper into me. Rock started a slow thrust of in and out, and I met his movements. As soon as Rock realised I was pain-free, his thrusts sped up, and I abandoned myself to the sensations he was creating. The only things I was aware of was the feel of Rock’s skin against mine, his cock hammering inside me and the sensations of the rope. Pressure built, and Rock sensed it. He thrust harder, pushing a second release for me, and we both cried out together as we exploded in each other’s arms.Rock collapsed onto his forearms, holding his weight off of me as he pumped a couple of times lazily and stilled. Our skin was slippery with sweat, and Rock’s hair hung over his eyes. When he looked up, he took my mouth before slipping out and rolling on his side. Rock drew me tightly into his embrace.“I love you,” Rock whispered, and I nestled more tightly against him.“I love you too,” I whispered back, and Rock stiffened.“Shit Carly, I forgot a condom,” Rock cried and smacked himself on the forehead.“It’s okay, I’m on the pill,” I replied, and Rock relaxed.“Thought I’d fucked up,” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“No,” I said. “That was amazing. I didn’t know sex could be like that.” Rock chuckled against my skin, his beard tickling me.“Why do you think we keep dragging our old ladies into the back rooms?” Rock asked.“You can drag me anytime you wish. Will you need rope each time?” I asked. Rock ran his fingers down my still bound arms.“No, I just prefer it, but I can imagine your body like this if I wanted to,” Rock said, tracing knots.“I felt amazing, like you knew how hard to tie and when not to, I felt completely safe and cherished.”“Good, that’s how you were meant to feel,” Rock said. His cock poked at me again, and I giggled.“Love that sound Carly,” Rock said, getting to his feet. I couldn’t believe his cock was ready again, and I watched Rock’s taut ass stroll across to the bathroom. He came back minutes later, his cock still twitching and hard. Rock cleaned between my legs, and his eyes twinkled at me.“Round two?” Rock teased. I gave a teasing sigh and flopped on my back, opening my legs.“If you insist!” I teased, and Rock laughed.“Oh, Carly, where you’re concerned, I’ll always insist!” Rock said and bent his head.◆◆◆ Hours later, I traced the marks on my arms that the knots had left. Rock had assured me they would fade quickly, which I thought was a shame after looking at the patterns. Rock sat behind me in the huge bath the ensuite had. He lazily washed my stomach and breasts as I leaned my head back against his chest. We’d made love several times before Rock called a halt, explaining I wouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow. While I teased him, laughing about his prowess, Rock had explained patiently that I’d used muscles in different ways than they should be used. That made sense.Rock poured water over my head, startling me from my thoughts and making me jump. A rough chuckle left Rock’s lips as he began massaging shampoo into my hair, and a soft moan escaped my lips. I’d always loved my hair being brushed or played with, and this was heaven to me. A large hand covered my eyes and rinsed me clean. Rock shunted me forward and surged upwards out of the bath, water pouring off him.Rock deftly wrapped me in a towel and, with a wink, scooped me into his arms and carried me into the bedroom. I snuggled against his chest, happy to be close to him, and abruptly Rock placed me on my feet and began drying me. There was no embarrassment between us now. On the contrary, I was more than happy for Rock to look over my body. Especially as I knew what Rock could do to me.“Naked sleeping?” Rock asked. I didn’t reply but scrambled buck naked into bed.◆◆◆ Hell, I was sore the next day, as Rock had predicted. I had a quick shower before I dressed, and then I made my way to the kitchen, where Rock was glowering at his phone. Rock reached out an arm, and I grabbed the coffee he was offering.“Baby, I’m sorry. Gotta head to the office for a couple of hours,” Rock said grimly.“Is everything okay?” I asked, worried.“No, a bloody idiot had a fall on our site because he refused to wear the correct safety gear. I need to take statements. Can you stay here today? The weather’s predicting a big storm. The weather channel is warning everyone to stay home where it will be safer. I’m going to take the SUV, will leave my bike and Charger here.”“Sure. Is it going to be bad? Will we be affected by the storm?” I asked, peering at the tv.“Road closure and possible localised flooding. So stay put, baby, please,” Rock asked.“Okay,” I said happily, planning my lazy day until Rock got home. Rock pulled me to him and dropped a searing kiss on my mouth.“Hurry back,” I muttered when Rock pulled away.“You can bet on that, no sex today, you need to recover, but there’s plenty more we can do.” Rock winked as I pouted. “Be good!” Rock said, tapping me on the ass. In reply, I waggled my ass, and Rock chuckled and kissed me one more time before leaving. Tiredly yawning, I poured cereal and sat on a stool and turned the tv up louder.Rock had been correct, I mused as I studied the vast weather system heading towards us. I loved storms and was hoping this would be a doozy. I listened carefully to the warnings as I did a quick sweep around the house, making sure all windows were closed and locked. And I checked the doors were also shut in each room. If a window blew and the door wasn’t shut properly, then the wind could cause untold damage blowing through an open house.Once I’d done the inside, I donned a heavy coat and boots and went outside. The garden furniture needed storing away, and once that was done, I checked for anything else loose and tied it down or shoved it in the garage. I’d just finished everything when my phone beeped, and I looked down. A message popped up from Rock telling me to head to the clubhouse, as the weather warnings had been ramped up. I glanced at the sky and was startled to see how black and heavy it was looking. Distant thunder rumbled, and I knew the storm would reach us soon.I jogged inside and grabbed the keys to Rock’s beloved Charger, and ran out to the garage. The thunder sounded closer now, and I didn’t hesitate throttling the car. I had just reached Jackson Blvd when the sky opened, and the rain came down heavily. Even though the Charger’s windscreen wipers worked frantically, I had to slow to a crawl because visibility was zero. Bright headlights flooded my back window, and I cursed at the idiot who was fast coming up my ass. Peering through the window, I saw a spot to pull over and let the asshole go past.Instead, to my surprise, the asshole pulled in behind, and I wondered if it was one of the Rage brothers. Some of them had trucks and SUVs. Unsure whether to get out of the car or not, I hesitated. But the decision was taken from my hands when the door was yanked open, and a fist flew towards my face. The last thing I saw was Otis’s gloating grin.",

      "content": "Chapter Six.“Good morning!” Ellen chirped at eight o’clock Saturday morning. I blinked blearily at the cheerful woman as she held up a bag of pastries and coffee. I snatched the coffee without a second thought as Ellen breezed past me and into the house. Not functioning yet, I followed her as Ellen wandered around and finally landed in the kitchen. Ellen was opening drawers and peering in cupboards, and clucking her tongue.“What time is it?” Rock complained as he entered the kitchen wearing low-slung jeans. My mouth watered at the sight of his chest, and I fixated on it happily.“Eight o’clock, and you sound just like the prospects did when I roused them an hour ago,” Ellen chirped, and Rock and I swapped unhappy glances. Had Ellen forgot it was Saturday? I silently whined. The one day, I could have had a lay-in and be lazy. But, instead, Ellen was a cruel, cruel person who ruthlessly woke up innocently sleeping people.“Where’s Axel?” Rock grunted, reaching for the coffee.“Oh, he’s supervising the prospects. Axel’s a grumpy bear in the morning, so I thought he could work it out on them before coming here,” Ellen said, grinning. Okay, that confirmed it. Ellen was desperately cruel and evil. Ellen setting a grumpy Axel on the prospects was unadulterated evil. Blacker than black, darker than dark. Why on earth would Ellen do that to those poor prospects?“Fuckers won’t know what’s hit them,” Rock confirmed my thoughts.“Well, they’ll certainly be awake when moving your furniture. Now I plan to have everything laid out in the front yard, and then we can see what goes where. Go shower Carly and dress in old clothing. Sin’s on her way too, and she’s bringing breakfast. These were cheeky early morning snacks,” Ellen said, holding up the bag of pastries. Rock snatched it and pulled out a bear claw. He passed me a cinnamon bun, and I bit into it, happily inhaling the scent of the spice. I was a cinnamon freak. If something contained the spice, I ate it.“Jett’s coming?” Rock asked, looking hopeful.“Jett’s bringing the babies later,” Ellen said, and Rock looked crestfallen. “No getting out of work, Rock!” I snatched a second cinnamon roll and picked up my coffee, which was also cinnamon flavoured, and let Rock lead me from the kitchen. This was shaping up to be a busy, chaotic day.Three hours later, I stared at the mass of furniture spread over the front yard. There was that much of it I didn’t know where to start, and Ellen was busying herself from piece-to-piece cooing over them.“You look ever so pale,” Sin said, approaching.“Yeah, I think I underestimated the magnitude of the task ahead of me,” I said, waving a hand. Rock and Axel had taken one glance at the yard and disappeared around the back. The prospects lay on the grass looking winded.“Okay, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Then, when you open them, walk around the furniture. And when you feel an item should be placed in a certain room, shout up, and I’ll pop a post-it on it,” Ellen chirped, approaching at speed. Dubiously sending Ellen a look, I did as she ordered but took several breaths and then opened my eyes. The first thing I spied was a hand-carved cabinet and knew where it belonged.“Entrance hall, that dresser in the dining room, and that coffee table in the snug,” I said, pointing at the three things. Sin dashed over and wrote on post-its and stuck them on the furniture.“Glad we’re doing this now,” Ellen said, glancing at her phone. “The weather is predicting heavy rainfall next week.” I made a moue with my mouth. Yeah, I’d have hated moving in during that. But now I had an idea on how to label the furniture, everything went much quicker. The prospects began moving the furniture into the rooms, and within a few more hours, the yard was empty. The house, however, was a mess. I sighed because my work was not yet done. But the good news was, Rosie, Jodie and Serenity arrived, bringing a hamper of food.“Wonderful!” Ellen cried, clapping her hands together.“Willow was coming, but she’s been called into work,” Serenity said. I studied Drake’s daughters and noted the tiredness in their faces. They’d been flying back and forth ever since Harley had been put into a coma. The little bastards who’d attacked Harley had suffered huge servings of karma.“Yes, Willow said she’s just landed a case,” Ellen said with a frown.“Do we need to worry?” I asked, and Ellen shook her head.“No, this isn’t as dangerous as Willow being undercover. A simple, straightforward case Willow claims,” Ellen said, reassuring us.“That’s good. So do you want any help?” Jodie asked.“Can you afford to break a nail?” I teased, and Jodie poked her tongue out. I responded in kind, and we smiled.“Yes, I can afford to break a nail, Serenity, however, can’t,” Jodie said teasingly, and Serenity broke a piece of bread off her sandwich and threw it at Jodie.“Says the prima donna,” Serenity retorted. “Say, as you’re with Rock, you know that makes you our Aunt Carly.” I blanched as Serenity began laughing hysterically. Jodie’s eyes held a wicked glint as a slow smile crossed her face.“Don’t you even dare!” I warned Jodie, who broke into gales of laughter. A car pulled up, and Penny climbed out with Texas and their two younger children. Penny glanced around and put her fingers to her lips, and whistled. Rosie trotted over, opened the SUV trunk, and picked up a large container with bread rolls.“Hey girls, I brought food, enough for an army,” Penny called as brothers appeared from every direction and sniffed the air.“What we got, Penny?” Calamity asked, approaching at speed.“Chilli dogs, two Enchilagne and pastries,” Penny called back, and she became muffled as hulking brothers and prospects surrounded her. Moments later, Axel, Texas, Rock and the prospects carried urns and containers back. Texas didn’t appear happy, and Rosie leaned over in an aside.“Dad loves Mom’s Enchilagne, but god help us if he has to share it. Mom’s made Dad two at home,” Rosie confided.“Talk about poor communication; we bring a hamper, and Penny brings a feast,” Serenity smiled as we heard sounds of fighting coming from the backyard. Wandering around, we saw the brothers lined up in front of a table and Penny giving them a stern gaze.“Behave, I’ll serve you and then when the girls have put some aside, you may help yourself to the leftovers!” Penny warned. We watched in amusement as Penny served each brother a generous helping of Enchilagne and three chilli dogs laden with cheese and nacho toppings. Texas was balefully looking at the rapidly emptying tins and muttering under his breath.“Dad,” Rosie hissed, and Texas glanced across. “Mom saved two at home for you.” Texas’s head twisted so he could face the innocent expression Penny was offering, and he sighed.“Might have guessed, there’s no way Penny would starve her man,” Texas rumbled, and Axel snorted.“Wanna bet, Penny loves me more,” Axel teased, which didn’t go down too well with Texas.“Can you believe how they fight over food?” Ellen said, sitting with a chilli dog. Penny had covered up slices of the Enchilagne and chilli dogs for us to eat later, and the seven men in my backyard were eyeing the leftovers greedily.“Have you seen Rock when it’s the last taco?” I asked. Ellen blanched and nodded. “Like all men, they live through their stomach.”“Truthfully, it’s a wonder Uncle Ace survives. Aunt Artemis is a terrible cook,” Serenity said. Everyone who heard Serenity’s words blanched. No lie, Artemis was terrible; she’d once put Ace in the hospital trying to make a pie.“That’s why she has Mrs Humphries,” Rosie said, and we nodded.“After Artemis poisoned Ace with that peach pie, I don’t think I’ve eaten peach pie since,” Rock mused, and everyone nodded. Ace’s poisoning had been so violent none of us had eaten it since then.“Did you hear what Dad’s trying to do for Mum?” Jodie asked, and we shook our heads. “Dad wants a picture of all the kids together, from big to little, but he wants it done as a portrait. Dad’s having murder getting us together and has been banging his head against a brick wall for the last six weeks,” Jodie said, grinning.“Poor Drake,” I muttered. Having to gather eighteen kids together for a family event was a logistical nightmare. Then my thoughts turned to Harley.“Dad’s providing the artist a picture of Harley,” Serenity said, reading my thoughts. But, jeez, it was nearly a year since Harley had been attacked from behind and put into a coma. Serenity’s smiling face disappeared, and I put a hand out and touched her arm.“Harley will recover; he’s just lazy. He’s hung on this long, and they didn’t think he’d make it through the first night. Then they said twenty-four hours, and so on. Harley has fought every battle and is now being lazy, taking his time, but he will wake up,” I said fiercely, and Jodie and Serenity smiled. That shit had to be so hard for them. Their younger sibling trapped in a world Harley couldn’t escape.That was one thing I sincerely admired Phoe and Drake for. Although mainly Phoe, because Drake had only been around a short while. But they raised their kids to believe that a blood bond didn’t mean shit. Blood could easily betray one another. It didn’t matter that most of their kids were adopted. Once Phoe’s brood claimed them, they were family. And those kids stuck together through thick and thin. All of them were terrific kids, even the little ones. And Drake had taken on sixteen kids that weren’t any tie to him other than the fact they belonged to the woman he loved. And it had to be love to offer that level of commitment.After a long break, we began moving furniture around inside. Once each room was placed as I wanted, Rosie, Serenity, Jodie and Penny started dusting, cleaning and hoovering. Of course, the guys grunted and complained as they moved the furniture where I wanted it to go, bitching when I changed my mind on a placement. But by six that evening, everything was done. The bedrooms had beds in, and Klutz and Calamity had been whizzes at putting them together. The dining room held a twenty-seat long table and sideboards, all the rooms were now cosy and welcoming. And I was happier than a pig in muck as to how it had gone so wonderfully well.The prospects left first, nearly running to their bikes in haste to get away from mine and Ellen’s enthusiastic thank you’s. Jett (who’d arrived with his girls), Texas, Rock and Axel sat on the back patio gazing at the garden.“Needs an overhaul,” Axel boomed as we approached.“Yeah, Ezra has been booked in for a fortnight. Told Ezra what I want doing with it,” Rock grunted as I slid around to him. Rock hooked an arm lazily around my waist and pulled me into his lap.“Do I get to know?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope,” Rock said, popping the p in nope. “It’s a surprise and one you can keep that cute little nose out of.”“Well, I need food,” Penny said, glancing at the table where only crumbs remained. Strangely enough, every brother sat up and became alert. I swapped glances with Penny and Ellen, and we laughed.“There’s a new sushi place in town,” Serenity suggested, and the men shook their heads.“Fried chicken?” Jett suggested, and everyone nodded. The chicken place also did the best barbecue ribs ever, so I ordered a rack of them. Rock, Sin and Jodie followed suit on my idea of chicken and ribs, and Texas phoned it through and gave them the address. I wondered if we were outside of their delivery range, but as soon as Texas gave his name, it didn’t matter. I half expected they’d deliver to the next state over if it involved Rage.Jett started the firepit as Amelia settled herself on Axel’s lap, and Ellen held baby Brooke. Ellen had no children of her own, which clearly meant no grandchildren. But coming into Axel’s life, Ellen suddenly discovered an abundance of children and was in grandmother heaven. After spending the entire day with her, I saw Ellen for what she was, a kind, caring, genuine soul who had a lot of love to offer. Axel was one lucky man. When they went home, I was slightly tipsy and determined to make Rock mine that night.Rock was downstairs as I showered and dressed in a skimpy baby doll nightdress. It wasn’t something I’d usually wear, but Rock’s eyes had lit up when I held it up to him. I arranged myself on the bed, trying for a sexy pose and feeling awkward and stupid. Damn this, I was a virgin and didn’t know how to seduce the man I desired so badly. I heard footsteps and started to move when the door opened, and, blushing, I lay back and gazed into Rock’s surprised eyes.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Rock, I want to make love. Because I’m tired of waiting around for you to make a move,” I said boldly, and Rock’s eyes flared, and I saw a stiffening in his jeans.“Ah,” Rock said and gulped. That was good, right? A gulp?“Please don’t say no, please don’t refuse me,” I begged, a little ashamed. I’d put myself out there and needed Rock to meet me halfway. Rock ran a hand across his face and strolled to the bed.“Carly, I want you. Never mistake that. But there’s a reason I’ve been hesitant. Vanilla sex is great, but there’s another version that I far more prefer. And I was biding my time to let you get used to being us before introducing you to it,” Rock said quietly. My curiosity peaked. What exactly was Rock into sexually?“Dominant sex?” I asked, yeah I’d read Fifty Shades.“No,” Rock said shortly, and I could see his mind churning. “Forget it. We’ll go with vanilla.”“Rock, talk to me. I’m your girl. There’s nothing you can’t tell me,” I encouraged, and Rock dropped his head.“Well… I prefer Shibari,” Rock said, and my mind stuttered. What on earth was Shibari?“Huh?” I said, confused.“Shibari is an artistic form of Japanese rope bondage. It’s a deeply intimate form of sex because you have to trust me completely to let me practise on you. Any doubt and it becomes uncomfortable for both of us. Here look,” Rock said, dragging his phone out, and I scooted closer. Rock pulled up some pictures and showed them to me. Amazed, I stared at the intricate knots making beautiful patterns binding a woman’s arms behind her back. I flipped to the next and blushed as I saw a woman’s torso bound and her breasts tied.“You practise this?” I asked, swiping again and studying another.“Yeah, I do, took classes with Lex. We both became adept at Shibari. Shibari is far different from normal bondage. I get aroused by the trust you place in me when I tie you. Normal bondage is about restraining you, Shibari is about freeing you. Even the ropes differ. Shibari uses natural fibres, while normal bondage uses hemp, polycotton or nylon. The natural fibres in Shibari ropes add to the arousal of yourself,” Rock said earnestly, explaining. I was stunned. I’d never have believed Rock was into this. Yet, I was aroused. The thought of trusting Rock completely and putting myself in his hands caused a trickle of sensation between my legs.“So Shibari isn’t about restraint?” I asked.“No, look, see how her torso is bound, but her arms and legs are free. Shibari is about you trusting me to be intimate with your body and allowing me to bind you. Shibari can cause some pain depending on the practitioner, but I only cause pleasurable pain with it. I don’t like to cause pain for the sake of it. Done correctly, the pain caused by Shibari should always be pleasurable,” Rock explained.“Go on,” I said quietly, listening.“For me, each tie, each knot means something; it places you fully in my hands. It’s not meant to be degrading or violent. Shibari’s about pleasure, allowing me to touch you and share intimacy together. There’s different thickness in ropes, and sometimes you can use silk to caress the skin, making the experience more pleasure. The sensation of the rope and ties make your skin more sensitive. You receive pleasure in your own submission and trust. With every knot I tie, I feel your surrender, and it’s terribly empowering,” Rock said, his hands dangling loosely on his knees.“And this arouses you?” I asked, needing to know.“More than vanilla or BDSM? Yes, Shibari arouses me painfully,” Rock admitted.“Where would you tie me?” I asked, needing to know.“To start, I wouldn’t bind your arms together or anything straight away. We could start with wrapping one arm and moving across your chest here.” Rock stroked the skin above my breasts. “And then bind the other arm. You would be free to move and stop me if needed,” Rock said, his eyes alert.“I’m okay with that,” I said, and before Rock could say anything, I gathered my courage and pulled my nightie off. Rock’s eyes flared as he gazed at my body, and he swallowed hard.“Fuck, I’ve seen you naked before, but this time is different,” Rock said and took my mouth in a deep kiss. He broke it off and rolled off the bed and got to his knees, and pulled a box out from under the bed. I peered over as Rock opened it, and I saw coloured rope inside it.“Feel this Carly, it’s the one I intend you use.” I reached out and touched the blue rope; it was silky and smooth. But it was rather thick, and that worried me. So I peered into the box and saw thinner ropes.“Why not them?” I asked.“The thinner the rope, the more intense. The thinness puts pressure on your skin and pressure points, so a thick rope is the best to start with. Thin rope used wrongly can bite into your skin, and as a beginner, you may struggle, hurting yourself. Thick rope introduces you to the act of Shibari,” Rock explained.“Okay, so what do I do?” I asked.“Stand up and let me love you,” Rock replied. Taking a deep breath, I stood up in front of Rock as his eyes drank in my body.“As I tie you, I’ll touch and kiss your skin,” Rock said, unwrapping the rope. Rock stripped and dumped his clothes as I took in his hard, muscled body. “I want you to see the effect you have on me as I can feel the effect I have on you.” Gently Rock took my hand, and standing in front of me, placed it on his chest. I swallowed hard as Rock draped the rope around me, letting my skin become used to the sensation. Gently Rock started to tie and make knots, and I shivered under his hands and mouth. With each knot Rock tied, he dropped a kiss on the skin just below.Slowly Rock worked his way up my arm, his gaze focused and intent on the act of tying. His cock was so hard, I thought it would break. As Rock stepped closer, his cock pressed against my stomach, and a moan left my mouth. Wetness pooled between my legs, and I ached for his touch.I lost myself in Rock’s world, entirely under his control and ready to obey anything he commanded. Once my arm was done, Rock took another length of rope and bound my other arm. I didn’t know if I could wait for Rock to bind my chest, as desire was all I could think of. That and Rock’s hot mouth caressing my skin in featherlight touches. I stared at my arms intricately bound and yet at the same time a simple pattern. The knots looked beautiful, and I admired Rock’s skill. Rock’s breathing had changed halfway to finishing my first arm, and now as he stepped back, his unsteady breathing turned to panting.Concentration on his face, Rock unravelled the third rope and began binding above my chest, resting on my collar bones but not near my neck. I could barely stand. Rock was right. This was so intense, I trusted Rock to pull the ropes tightly but not hurt me. Aroused, I allowed Rock to bind my chest but leave me free to back away if needed. Featherlight touches aroused my skin until it almost became torturous, and I understood the painful pleasure Rock had spoken of.When he was done, Rock stepped back and stared at me. His cock was twitching and wet at the top, nipples hard and sacs drawn up tightly. My own nipples were tight little bullets, and my breasts a flushed pink. Between my legs, I was so wet it was painful. Rock took my hand and led me to the bed. Carefully, Rock laid me down, and I wondered what to do. Rock arranged my legs and knelt between them. His face was tight with desire, and slowly Rock lifted my arms above my head, the action drawing my breasts higher, and nodded. Rock bent down and took a nipple in his mouth, one hand caressing the knots on my arm.A cry left my lips as Rock’s hot wet mouth sucked my nipple hard, and Rock ran his fingers down the knots, and my skin reacted sensitively. My head dropped back to the pillows as Rock reluctantly dragged his mouth from my nipple and swooped on the other. My hips moved wildly, my body telling me what it needed, although I wasn’t experienced. Rock shuffled up, and my legs clamped around one of his knees. I gasped as I realised I could move, and the friction of Rock’s skin on my wet pussy made me cry again.“Rock,” I gasped. Rock broke off from my nipple and leant on his arms as he drew in deep, ragged breaths.“It’s okay, baby,” Rock said, kissing me and his hand stroked my skin. The world was on fire. Every nerve was electrified, and I needed release. My pussy spasmed against his skin, and Rock shuffled down the bed and dropped between my legs. Rock kissed each thigh, and he gently put my legs over his shoulders. Cold air slapped against my clit as he opened my folds, and I let out a tortured cry.“Let go, baby,” Rock muttered and dipped his head between my legs. The first touch of his tongue sent my hips thrusting up as I screamed. The second touch drowned me in sensation, and I gave over to my body’s demands. Wild cries left my lips as my hips thrust against his mouth, and Rock held my ass cheeks, lifting me up and helping me grind against him. Finally, with a strangled scream, I exploded and collapsed on the bed.“I’m going to enter you, Carly. Baby, I can’t last any longer,” Rock said, his huge body rising above me. I nodded weakly, unable to answer, and Rock gathered my hands above my head and held them in one hand. Slowly, his cock prodded my entrance, and Rock fed himself into me. The empty sensation I’d suffered disappeared as his huge cock filled me. Rock hit the barrier of my virginity and paused.“Will it hurt?” I mumbled, holding his gaze.“Somewhat,” Rock murmured regretfully and thrust through the barrier. My pained cry broke out, and Rock kissed me deeply, drawing my cry into his mouth. Rock’s body was tense and solid as he held himself still to allow me to adjust to his size. My first reaction had been to buck Rock off and fight him, but slowly I relaxed, and my pussy held him tight. Rock shifted and seated himself fully in me, and the emptiness finally disappeared.“So fuckin’ tight,” Rock growled and withdrew and pushed back in slowly. I winced as pain pinched again, and then it was gone. I wriggled my hips and moved tentatively with him, and Rock hissed.“Wrap your legs around me, baby,” Rock demanded, and I obeyed, feeling him slide even deeper into me. Rock started a slow thrust of in and out, and I met his movements. As soon as Rock realised I was pain-free, his thrusts sped up, and I abandoned myself to the sensations he was creating. The only things I was aware of was the feel of Rock’s skin against mine, his cock hammering inside me and the sensations of the rope. Pressure built, and Rock sensed it. He thrust harder, pushing a second release for me, and we both cried out together as we exploded in each other’s arms.Rock collapsed onto his forearms, holding his weight off of me as he pumped a couple of times lazily and stilled. Our skin was slippery with sweat, and Rock’s hair hung over his eyes. When he looked up, he took my mouth before slipping out and rolling on his side. Rock drew me tightly into his embrace.“I love you,” Rock whispered, and I nestled more tightly against him.“I love you too,” I whispered back, and Rock stiffened.“Shit Carly, I forgot a condom,” Rock cried and smacked himself on the forehead.“It’s okay, I’m on the pill,” I replied, and Rock relaxed.“Thought I’d fucked up,” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“No,” I said. “That was amazing. I didn’t know sex could be like that.” Rock chuckled against my skin, his beard tickling me.“Why do you think we keep dragging our old ladies into the back rooms?” Rock asked.“You can drag me anytime you wish. Will you need rope each time?” I asked. Rock ran his fingers down my still bound arms.“No, I just prefer it, but I can imagine your body like this if I wanted to,” Rock said, tracing knots.“I felt amazing, like you knew how hard to tie and when not to, I felt completely safe and cherished.”“Good, that’s how you were meant to feel,” Rock said. His cock poked at me again, and I giggled.“Love that sound Carly,” Rock said, getting to his feet. I couldn’t believe his cock was ready again, and I watched Rock’s taut ass stroll across to the bathroom. He came back minutes later, his cock still twitching and hard. Rock cleaned between my legs, and his eyes twinkled at me.“Round two?” Rock teased. I gave a teasing sigh and flopped on my back, opening my legs.“If you insist!” I teased, and Rock laughed.“Oh, Carly, where you’re concerned, I’ll always insist!” Rock said and bent his head.◆◆◆ Hours later, I traced the marks on my arms that the knots had left. Rock had assured me they would fade quickly, which I thought was a shame after looking at the patterns. Rock sat behind me in the huge bath the ensuite had. He lazily washed my stomach and breasts as I leaned my head back against his chest. We’d made love several times before Rock called a halt, explaining I wouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow. While I teased him, laughing about his prowess, Rock had explained patiently that I’d used muscles in different ways than they should be used. That made sense.Rock poured water over my head, startling me from my thoughts and making me jump. A rough chuckle left Rock’s lips as he began massaging shampoo into my hair, and a soft moan escaped my lips. I’d always loved my hair being brushed or played with, and this was heaven to me. A large hand covered my eyes and rinsed me clean. Rock shunted me forward and surged upwards out of the bath, water pouring off him.Rock deftly wrapped me in a towel and, with a wink, scooped me into his arms and carried me into the bedroom. I snuggled against his chest, happy to be close to him, and abruptly Rock placed me on my feet and began drying me. There was no embarrassment between us now. On the contrary, I was more than happy for Rock to look over my body. Especially as I knew what Rock could do to me.“Naked sleeping?” Rock asked. I didn’t reply but scrambled buck naked into bed.◆◆◆ Hell, I was sore the next day, as Rock had predicted. I had a quick shower before I dressed, and then I made my way to the kitchen, where Rock was glowering at his phone. Rock reached out an arm, and I grabbed the coffee he was offering.“Baby, I’m sorry. Gotta head to the office for a couple of hours,” Rock said grimly.“Is everything okay?” I asked, worried.“No, a bloody idiot had a fall on our site because he refused to wear the correct safety gear. I need to take statements. Can you stay here today? The weather’s predicting a big storm. The weather channel is warning everyone to stay home where it will be safer. I’m going to take the SUV, will leave my bike and Charger here.”“Sure. Is it going to be bad? Will we be affected by the storm?” I asked, peering at the tv.“Road closure and possible localised flooding. So stay put, baby, please,” Rock asked.“Okay,” I said happily, planning my lazy day until Rock got home. Rock pulled me to him and dropped a searing kiss on my mouth.“Hurry back,” I muttered when Rock pulled away.“You can bet on that, no sex today, you need to recover, but there’s plenty more we can do.” Rock winked as I pouted. “Be good!” Rock said, tapping me on the ass. In reply, I waggled my ass, and Rock chuckled and kissed me one more time before leaving. Tiredly yawning, I poured cereal and sat on a stool and turned the tv up louder.Rock had been correct, I mused as I studied the vast weather system heading towards us. I loved storms and was hoping this would be a doozy. I listened carefully to the warnings as I did a quick sweep around the house, making sure all windows were closed and locked. And I checked the doors were also shut in each room. If a window blew and the door wasn’t shut properly, then the wind could cause untold damage blowing through an open house.Once I’d done the inside, I donned a heavy coat and boots and went outside. The garden furniture needed storing away, and once that was done, I checked for anything else loose and tied it down or shoved it in the garage. I’d just finished everything when my phone beeped, and I looked down. A message popped up from Rock telling me to head to the clubhouse, as the weather warnings had been ramped up. I glanced at the sky and was startled to see how black and heavy it was looking. Distant thunder rumbled, and I knew the storm would reach us soon.I jogged inside and grabbed the keys to Rock’s beloved Charger, and ran out to the garage. The thunder sounded closer now, and I didn’t hesitate throttling the car. I had just reached Jackson Blvd when the sky opened, and the rain came down heavily. Even though the Charger’s windscreen wipers worked frantically, I had to slow to a crawl because visibility was zero. Bright headlights flooded my back window, and I cursed at the idiot who was fast coming up my ass. Peering through the window, I saw a spot to pull over and let the asshole go past.Instead, to my surprise, the asshole pulled in behind, and I wondered if it was one of the Rage brothers. Some of them had trucks and SUVs. Unsure whether to get out of the car or not, I hesitated. But the decision was taken from my hands when the door was yanked open, and a fist flew towards my face. The last thing I saw was Otis’s gloating grin.",

      "content": "Chapter Six.“Good morning!” Ellen chirped at eight o’clock Saturday morning. I blinked blearily at the cheerful woman as she held up a bag of pastries and coffee. I snatched the coffee without a second thought as Ellen breezed past me and into the house. Not functioning yet, I followed her as Ellen wandered around and finally landed in the kitchen. Ellen was opening drawers and peering in cupboards, and clucking her tongue.“What time is it?” Rock complained as he entered the kitchen wearing low-slung jeans. My mouth watered at the sight of his chest, and I fixated on it happily.“Eight o’clock, and you sound just like the prospects did when I roused them an hour ago,” Ellen chirped, and Rock and I swapped unhappy glances. Had Ellen forgot it was Saturday? I silently whined. The one day, I could have had a lay-in and be lazy. But, instead, Ellen was a cruel, cruel person who ruthlessly woke up innocently sleeping people.“Where’s Axel?” Rock grunted, reaching for the coffee.“Oh, he’s supervising the prospects. Axel’s a grumpy bear in the morning, so I thought he could work it out on them before coming here,” Ellen said, grinning. Okay, that confirmed it. Ellen was desperately cruel and evil. Ellen setting a grumpy Axel on the prospects was unadulterated evil. Blacker than black, darker than dark. Why on earth would Ellen do that to those poor prospects?“Fuckers won’t know what’s hit them,” Rock confirmed my thoughts.“Well, they’ll certainly be awake when moving your furniture. Now I plan to have everything laid out in the front yard, and then we can see what goes where. Go shower Carly and dress in old clothing. Sin’s on her way too, and she’s bringing breakfast. These were cheeky early morning snacks,” Ellen said, holding up the bag of pastries. Rock snatched it and pulled out a bear claw. He passed me a cinnamon bun, and I bit into it, happily inhaling the scent of the spice. I was a cinnamon freak. If something contained the spice, I ate it.“Jett’s coming?” Rock asked, looking hopeful.“Jett’s bringing the babies later,” Ellen said, and Rock looked crestfallen. “No getting out of work, Rock!” I snatched a second cinnamon roll and picked up my coffee, which was also cinnamon flavoured, and let Rock lead me from the kitchen. This was shaping up to be a busy, chaotic day.Three hours later, I stared at the mass of furniture spread over the front yard. There was that much of it I didn’t know where to start, and Ellen was busying herself from piece-to-piece cooing over them.“You look ever so pale,” Sin said, approaching.“Yeah, I think I underestimated the magnitude of the task ahead of me,” I said, waving a hand. Rock and Axel had taken one glance at the yard and disappeared around the back. The prospects lay on the grass looking winded.“Okay, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Then, when you open them, walk around the furniture. And when you feel an item should be placed in a certain room, shout up, and I’ll pop a post-it on it,” Ellen chirped, approaching at speed. Dubiously sending Ellen a look, I did as she ordered but took several breaths and then opened my eyes. The first thing I spied was a hand-carved cabinet and knew where it belonged.“Entrance hall, that dresser in the dining room, and that coffee table in the snug,” I said, pointing at the three things. Sin dashed over and wrote on post-its and stuck them on the furniture.“Glad we’re doing this now,” Ellen said, glancing at her phone. “The weather is predicting heavy rainfall next week.” I made a moue with my mouth. Yeah, I’d have hated moving in during that. But now I had an idea on how to label the furniture, everything went much quicker. The prospects began moving the furniture into the rooms, and within a few more hours, the yard was empty. The house, however, was a mess. I sighed because my work was not yet done. But the good news was, Rosie, Jodie and Serenity arrived, bringing a hamper of food.“Wonderful!” Ellen cried, clapping her hands together.“Willow was coming, but she’s been called into work,” Serenity said. I studied Drake’s daughters and noted the tiredness in their faces. They’d been flying back and forth ever since Harley had been put into a coma. The little bastards who’d attacked Harley had suffered huge servings of karma.“Yes, Willow said she’s just landed a case,” Ellen said with a frown.“Do we need to worry?” I asked, and Ellen shook her head.“No, this isn’t as dangerous as Willow being undercover. A simple, straightforward case Willow claims,” Ellen said, reassuring us.“That’s good. So do you want any help?” Jodie asked.“Can you afford to break a nail?” I teased, and Jodie poked her tongue out. I responded in kind, and we smiled.“Yes, I can afford to break a nail, Serenity, however, can’t,” Jodie said teasingly, and Serenity broke a piece of bread off her sandwich and threw it at Jodie.“Says the prima donna,” Serenity retorted. “Say, as you’re with Rock, you know that makes you our Aunt Carly.” I blanched as Serenity began laughing hysterically. Jodie’s eyes held a wicked glint as a slow smile crossed her face.“Don’t you even dare!” I warned Jodie, who broke into gales of laughter. A car pulled up, and Penny climbed out with Texas and their two younger children. Penny glanced around and put her fingers to her lips, and whistled. Rosie trotted over, opened the SUV trunk, and picked up a large container with bread rolls.“Hey girls, I brought food, enough for an army,” Penny called as brothers appeared from every direction and sniffed the air.“What we got, Penny?” Calamity asked, approaching at speed.“Chilli dogs, two Enchilagne and pastries,” Penny called back, and she became muffled as hulking brothers and prospects surrounded her. Moments later, Axel, Texas, Rock and the prospects carried urns and containers back. Texas didn’t appear happy, and Rosie leaned over in an aside.“Dad loves Mom’s Enchilagne, but god help us if he has to share it. Mom’s made Dad two at home,” Rosie confided.“Talk about poor communication; we bring a hamper, and Penny brings a feast,” Serenity smiled as we heard sounds of fighting coming from the backyard. Wandering around, we saw the brothers lined up in front of a table and Penny giving them a stern gaze.“Behave, I’ll serve you and then when the girls have put some aside, you may help yourself to the leftovers!” Penny warned. We watched in amusement as Penny served each brother a generous helping of Enchilagne and three chilli dogs laden with cheese and nacho toppings. Texas was balefully looking at the rapidly emptying tins and muttering under his breath.“Dad,” Rosie hissed, and Texas glanced across. “Mom saved two at home for you.” Texas’s head twisted so he could face the innocent expression Penny was offering, and he sighed.“Might have guessed, there’s no way Penny would starve her man,” Texas rumbled, and Axel snorted.“Wanna bet, Penny loves me more,” Axel teased, which didn’t go down too well with Texas.“Can you believe how they fight over food?” Ellen said, sitting with a chilli dog. Penny had covered up slices of the Enchilagne and chilli dogs for us to eat later, and the seven men in my backyard were eyeing the leftovers greedily.“Have you seen Rock when it’s the last taco?” I asked. Ellen blanched and nodded. “Like all men, they live through their stomach.”“Truthfully, it’s a wonder Uncle Ace survives. Aunt Artemis is a terrible cook,” Serenity said. Everyone who heard Serenity’s words blanched. No lie, Artemis was terrible; she’d once put Ace in the hospital trying to make a pie.“That’s why she has Mrs Humphries,” Rosie said, and we nodded.“After Artemis poisoned Ace with that peach pie, I don’t think I’ve eaten peach pie since,” Rock mused, and everyone nodded. Ace’s poisoning had been so violent none of us had eaten it since then.“Did you hear what Dad’s trying to do for Mum?” Jodie asked, and we shook our heads. “Dad wants a picture of all the kids together, from big to little, but he wants it done as a portrait. Dad’s having murder getting us together and has been banging his head against a brick wall for the last six weeks,” Jodie said, grinning.“Poor Drake,” I muttered. Having to gather eighteen kids together for a family event was a logistical nightmare. Then my thoughts turned to Harley.“Dad’s providing the artist a picture of Harley,” Serenity said, reading my thoughts. But, jeez, it was nearly a year since Harley had been attacked from behind and put into a coma. Serenity’s smiling face disappeared, and I put a hand out and touched her arm.“Harley will recover; he’s just lazy. He’s hung on this long, and they didn’t think he’d make it through the first night. Then they said twenty-four hours, and so on. Harley has fought every battle and is now being lazy, taking his time, but he will wake up,” I said fiercely, and Jodie and Serenity smiled. That shit had to be so hard for them. Their younger sibling trapped in a world Harley couldn’t escape.That was one thing I sincerely admired Phoe and Drake for. Although mainly Phoe, because Drake had only been around a short while. But they raised their kids to believe that a blood bond didn’t mean shit. Blood could easily betray one another. It didn’t matter that most of their kids were adopted. Once Phoe’s brood claimed them, they were family. And those kids stuck together through thick and thin. All of them were terrific kids, even the little ones. And Drake had taken on sixteen kids that weren’t any tie to him other than the fact they belonged to the woman he loved. And it had to be love to offer that level of commitment.After a long break, we began moving furniture around inside. Once each room was placed as I wanted, Rosie, Serenity, Jodie and Penny started dusting, cleaning and hoovering. Of course, the guys grunted and complained as they moved the furniture where I wanted it to go, bitching when I changed my mind on a placement. But by six that evening, everything was done. The bedrooms had beds in, and Klutz and Calamity had been whizzes at putting them together. The dining room held a twenty-seat long table and sideboards, all the rooms were now cosy and welcoming. And I was happier than a pig in muck as to how it had gone so wonderfully well.The prospects left first, nearly running to their bikes in haste to get away from mine and Ellen’s enthusiastic thank you’s. Jett (who’d arrived with his girls), Texas, Rock and Axel sat on the back patio gazing at the garden.“Needs an overhaul,” Axel boomed as we approached.“Yeah, Ezra has been booked in for a fortnight. Told Ezra what I want doing with it,” Rock grunted as I slid around to him. Rock hooked an arm lazily around my waist and pulled me into his lap.“Do I get to know?” I asked, and Rock shook his head.“Nope,” Rock said, popping the p in nope. “It’s a surprise and one you can keep that cute little nose out of.”“Well, I need food,” Penny said, glancing at the table where only crumbs remained. Strangely enough, every brother sat up and became alert. I swapped glances with Penny and Ellen, and we laughed.“There’s a new sushi place in town,” Serenity suggested, and the men shook their heads.“Fried chicken?” Jett suggested, and everyone nodded. The chicken place also did the best barbecue ribs ever, so I ordered a rack of them. Rock, Sin and Jodie followed suit on my idea of chicken and ribs, and Texas phoned it through and gave them the address. I wondered if we were outside of their delivery range, but as soon as Texas gave his name, it didn’t matter. I half expected they’d deliver to the next state over if it involved Rage.Jett started the firepit as Amelia settled herself on Axel’s lap, and Ellen held baby Brooke. Ellen had no children of her own, which clearly meant no grandchildren. But coming into Axel’s life, Ellen suddenly discovered an abundance of children and was in grandmother heaven. After spending the entire day with her, I saw Ellen for what she was, a kind, caring, genuine soul who had a lot of love to offer. Axel was one lucky man. When they went home, I was slightly tipsy and determined to make Rock mine that night.Rock was downstairs as I showered and dressed in a skimpy baby doll nightdress. It wasn’t something I’d usually wear, but Rock’s eyes had lit up when I held it up to him. I arranged myself on the bed, trying for a sexy pose and feeling awkward and stupid. Damn this, I was a virgin and didn’t know how to seduce the man I desired so badly. I heard footsteps and started to move when the door opened, and, blushing, I lay back and gazed into Rock’s surprised eyes.“Carly?” Rock asked.“Rock, I want to make love. Because I’m tired of waiting around for you to make a move,” I said boldly, and Rock’s eyes flared, and I saw a stiffening in his jeans.“Ah,” Rock said and gulped. That was good, right? A gulp?“Please don’t say no, please don’t refuse me,” I begged, a little ashamed. I’d put myself out there and needed Rock to meet me halfway. Rock ran a hand across his face and strolled to the bed.“Carly, I want you. Never mistake that. But there’s a reason I’ve been hesitant. Vanilla sex is great, but there’s another version that I far more prefer. And I was biding my time to let you get used to being us before introducing you to it,” Rock said quietly. My curiosity peaked. What exactly was Rock into sexually?“Dominant sex?” I asked, yeah I’d read Fifty Shades.“No,” Rock said shortly, and I could see his mind churning. “Forget it. We’ll go with vanilla.”“Rock, talk to me. I’m your girl. There’s nothing you can’t tell me,” I encouraged, and Rock dropped his head.“Well… I prefer Shibari,” Rock said, and my mind stuttered. What on earth was Shibari?“Huh?” I said, confused.“Shibari is an artistic form of Japanese rope bondage. It’s a deeply intimate form of sex because you have to trust me completely to let me practise on you. Any doubt and it becomes uncomfortable for both of us. Here look,” Rock said, dragging his phone out, and I scooted closer. Rock pulled up some pictures and showed them to me. Amazed, I stared at the intricate knots making beautiful patterns binding a woman’s arms behind her back. I flipped to the next and blushed as I saw a woman’s torso bound and her breasts tied.“You practise this?” I asked, swiping again and studying another.“Yeah, I do, took classes with Lex. We both became adept at Shibari. Shibari is far different from normal bondage. I get aroused by the trust you place in me when I tie you. Normal bondage is about restraining you, Shibari is about freeing you. Even the ropes differ. Shibari uses natural fibres, while normal bondage uses hemp, polycotton or nylon. The natural fibres in Shibari ropes add to the arousal of yourself,” Rock said earnestly, explaining. I was stunned. I’d never have believed Rock was into this. Yet, I was aroused. The thought of trusting Rock completely and putting myself in his hands caused a trickle of sensation between my legs.“So Shibari isn’t about restraint?” I asked.“No, look, see how her torso is bound, but her arms and legs are free. Shibari is about you trusting me to be intimate with your body and allowing me to bind you. Shibari can cause some pain depending on the practitioner, but I only cause pleasurable pain with it. I don’t like to cause pain for the sake of it. Done correctly, the pain caused by Shibari should always be pleasurable,” Rock explained.“Go on,” I said quietly, listening.“For me, each tie, each knot means something; it places you fully in my hands. It’s not meant to be degrading or violent. Shibari’s about pleasure, allowing me to touch you and share intimacy together. There’s different thickness in ropes, and sometimes you can use silk to caress the skin, making the experience more pleasure. The sensation of the rope and ties make your skin more sensitive. You receive pleasure in your own submission and trust. With every knot I tie, I feel your surrender, and it’s terribly empowering,” Rock said, his hands dangling loosely on his knees.“And this arouses you?” I asked, needing to know.“More than vanilla or BDSM? Yes, Shibari arouses me painfully,” Rock admitted.“Where would you tie me?” I asked, needing to know.“To start, I wouldn’t bind your arms together or anything straight away. We could start with wrapping one arm and moving across your chest here.” Rock stroked the skin above my breasts. “And then bind the other arm. You would be free to move and stop me if needed,” Rock said, his eyes alert.“I’m okay with that,” I said, and before Rock could say anything, I gathered my courage and pulled my nightie off. Rock’s eyes flared as he gazed at my body, and he swallowed hard.“Fuck, I’ve seen you naked before, but this time is different,” Rock said and took my mouth in a deep kiss. He broke it off and rolled off the bed and got to his knees, and pulled a box out from under the bed. I peered over as Rock opened it, and I saw coloured rope inside it.“Feel this Carly, it’s the one I intend you use.” I reached out and touched the blue rope; it was silky and smooth. But it was rather thick, and that worried me. So I peered into the box and saw thinner ropes.“Why not them?” I asked.“The thinner the rope, the more intense. The thinness puts pressure on your skin and pressure points, so a thick rope is the best to start with. Thin rope used wrongly can bite into your skin, and as a beginner, you may struggle, hurting yourself. Thick rope introduces you to the act of Shibari,” Rock explained.“Okay, so what do I do?” I asked.“Stand up and let me love you,” Rock replied. Taking a deep breath, I stood up in front of Rock as his eyes drank in my body.“As I tie you, I’ll touch and kiss your skin,” Rock said, unwrapping the rope. Rock stripped and dumped his clothes as I took in his hard, muscled body. “I want you to see the effect you have on me as I can feel the effect I have on you.” Gently Rock took my hand, and standing in front of me, placed it on his chest. I swallowed hard as Rock draped the rope around me, letting my skin become used to the sensation. Gently Rock started to tie and make knots, and I shivered under his hands and mouth. With each knot Rock tied, he dropped a kiss on the skin just below.Slowly Rock worked his way up my arm, his gaze focused and intent on the act of tying. His cock was so hard, I thought it would break. As Rock stepped closer, his cock pressed against my stomach, and a moan left my mouth. Wetness pooled between my legs, and I ached for his touch.I lost myself in Rock’s world, entirely under his control and ready to obey anything he commanded. Once my arm was done, Rock took another length of rope and bound my other arm. I didn’t know if I could wait for Rock to bind my chest, as desire was all I could think of. That and Rock’s hot mouth caressing my skin in featherlight touches. I stared at my arms intricately bound and yet at the same time a simple pattern. The knots looked beautiful, and I admired Rock’s skill. Rock’s breathing had changed halfway to finishing my first arm, and now as he stepped back, his unsteady breathing turned to panting.Concentration on his face, Rock unravelled the third rope and began binding above my chest, resting on my collar bones but not near my neck. I could barely stand. Rock was right. This was so intense, I trusted Rock to pull the ropes tightly but not hurt me. Aroused, I allowed Rock to bind my chest but leave me free to back away if needed. Featherlight touches aroused my skin until it almost became torturous, and I understood the painful pleasure Rock had spoken of.When he was done, Rock stepped back and stared at me. His cock was twitching and wet at the top, nipples hard and sacs drawn up tightly. My own nipples were tight little bullets, and my breasts a flushed pink. Between my legs, I was so wet it was painful. Rock took my hand and led me to the bed. Carefully, Rock laid me down, and I wondered what to do. Rock arranged my legs and knelt between them. His face was tight with desire, and slowly Rock lifted my arms above my head, the action drawing my breasts higher, and nodded. Rock bent down and took a nipple in his mouth, one hand caressing the knots on my arm.A cry left my lips as Rock’s hot wet mouth sucked my nipple hard, and Rock ran his fingers down the knots, and my skin reacted sensitively. My head dropped back to the pillows as Rock reluctantly dragged his mouth from my nipple and swooped on the other. My hips moved wildly, my body telling me what it needed, although I wasn’t experienced. Rock shuffled up, and my legs clamped around one of his knees. I gasped as I realised I could move, and the friction of Rock’s skin on my wet pussy made me cry again.“Rock,” I gasped. Rock broke off from my nipple and leant on his arms as he drew in deep, ragged breaths.“It’s okay, baby,” Rock said, kissing me and his hand stroked my skin. The world was on fire. Every nerve was electrified, and I needed release. My pussy spasmed against his skin, and Rock shuffled down the bed and dropped between my legs. Rock kissed each thigh, and he gently put my legs over his shoulders. Cold air slapped against my clit as he opened my folds, and I let out a tortured cry.“Let go, baby,” Rock muttered and dipped his head between my legs. The first touch of his tongue sent my hips thrusting up as I screamed. The second touch drowned me in sensation, and I gave over to my body’s demands. Wild cries left my lips as my hips thrust against his mouth, and Rock held my ass cheeks, lifting me up and helping me grind against him. Finally, with a strangled scream, I exploded and collapsed on the bed.“I’m going to enter you, Carly. Baby, I can’t last any longer,” Rock said, his huge body rising above me. I nodded weakly, unable to answer, and Rock gathered my hands above my head and held them in one hand. Slowly, his cock prodded my entrance, and Rock fed himself into me. The empty sensation I’d suffered disappeared as his huge cock filled me. Rock hit the barrier of my virginity and paused.“Will it hurt?” I mumbled, holding his gaze.“Somewhat,” Rock murmured regretfully and thrust through the barrier. My pained cry broke out, and Rock kissed me deeply, drawing my cry into his mouth. Rock’s body was tense and solid as he held himself still to allow me to adjust to his size. My first reaction had been to buck Rock off and fight him, but slowly I relaxed, and my pussy held him tight. Rock shifted and seated himself fully in me, and the emptiness finally disappeared.“So fuckin’ tight,” Rock growled and withdrew and pushed back in slowly. I winced as pain pinched again, and then it was gone. I wriggled my hips and moved tentatively with him, and Rock hissed.“Wrap your legs around me, baby,” Rock demanded, and I obeyed, feeling him slide even deeper into me. Rock started a slow thrust of in and out, and I met his movements. As soon as Rock realised I was pain-free, his thrusts sped up, and I abandoned myself to the sensations he was creating. The only things I was aware of was the feel of Rock’s skin against mine, his cock hammering inside me and the sensations of the rope. Pressure built, and Rock sensed it. He thrust harder, pushing a second release for me, and we both cried out together as we exploded in each other’s arms.Rock collapsed onto his forearms, holding his weight off of me as he pumped a couple of times lazily and stilled. Our skin was slippery with sweat, and Rock’s hair hung over his eyes. When he looked up, he took my mouth before slipping out and rolling on his side. Rock drew me tightly into his embrace.“I love you,” Rock whispered, and I nestled more tightly against him.“I love you too,” I whispered back, and Rock stiffened.“Shit Carly, I forgot a condom,” Rock cried and smacked himself on the forehead.“It’s okay, I’m on the pill,” I replied, and Rock relaxed.“Thought I’d fucked up,” Rock growled, and I shook my head.“No,” I said. “That was amazing. I didn’t know sex could be like that.” Rock chuckled against my skin, his beard tickling me.“Why do you think we keep dragging our old ladies into the back rooms?” Rock asked.“You can drag me anytime you wish. Will you need rope each time?” I asked. Rock ran his fingers down my still bound arms.“No, I just prefer it, but I can imagine your body like this if I wanted to,” Rock said, tracing knots.“I felt amazing, like you knew how hard to tie and when not to, I felt completely safe and cherished.”“Good, that’s how you were meant to feel,” Rock said. His cock poked at me again, and I giggled.“Love that sound Carly,” Rock said, getting to his feet. I couldn’t believe his cock was ready again, and I watched Rock’s taut ass stroll across to the bathroom. He came back minutes later, his cock still twitching and hard. Rock cleaned between my legs, and his eyes twinkled at me.“Round two?” Rock teased. I gave a teasing sigh and flopped on my back, opening my legs.“If you insist!” I teased, and Rock laughed.“Oh, Carly, where you’re concerned, I’ll always insist!” Rock said and bent his head.◆◆◆ Hours later, I traced the marks on my arms that the knots had left. Rock had assured me they would fade quickly, which I thought was a shame after looking at the patterns. Rock sat behind me in the huge bath the ensuite had. He lazily washed my stomach and breasts as I leaned my head back against his chest. We’d made love several times before Rock called a halt, explaining I wouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow. While I teased him, laughing about his prowess, Rock had explained patiently that I’d used muscles in different ways than they should be used. That made sense.Rock poured water over my head, startling me from my thoughts and making me jump. A rough chuckle left Rock’s lips as he began massaging shampoo into my hair, and a soft moan escaped my lips. I’d always loved my hair being brushed or played with, and this was heaven to me. A large hand covered my eyes and rinsed me clean. Rock shunted me forward and surged upwards out of the bath, water pouring off him.Rock deftly wrapped me in a towel and, with a wink, scooped me into his arms and carried me into the bedroom. I snuggled against his chest, happy to be close to him, and abruptly Rock placed me on my feet and began drying me. There was no embarrassment between us now. On the contrary, I was more than happy for Rock to look over my body. Especially as I knew what Rock could do to me.“Naked sleeping?” Rock asked. I didn’t reply but scrambled buck naked into bed.◆◆◆ Hell, I was sore the next day, as Rock had predicted. I had a quick shower before I dressed, and then I made my way to the kitchen, where Rock was glowering at his phone. Rock reached out an arm, and I grabbed the coffee he was offering.“Baby, I’m sorry. Gotta head to the office for a couple of hours,” Rock said grimly.“Is everything okay?” I asked, worried.“No, a bloody idiot had a fall on our site because he refused to wear the correct safety gear. I need to take statements. Can you stay here today? The weather’s predicting a big storm. The weather channel is warning everyone to stay home where it will be safer. I’m going to take the SUV, will leave my bike and Charger here.”“Sure. Is it going to be bad? Will we be affected by the storm?” I asked, peering at the tv.“Road closure and possible localised flooding. So stay put, baby, please,” Rock asked.“Okay,” I said happily, planning my lazy day until Rock got home. Rock pulled me to him and dropped a searing kiss on my mouth.“Hurry back,” I muttered when Rock pulled away.“You can bet on that, no sex today, you need to recover, but there’s plenty more we can do.” Rock winked as I pouted. “Be good!” Rock said, tapping me on the ass. In reply, I waggled my ass, and Rock chuckled and kissed me one more time before leaving. Tiredly yawning, I poured cereal and sat on a stool and turned the tv up louder.Rock had been correct, I mused as I studied the vast weather system heading towards us. I loved storms and was hoping this would be a doozy. I listened carefully to the warnings as I did a quick sweep around the house, making sure all windows were closed and locked. And I checked the doors were also shut in each room. If a window blew and the door wasn’t shut properly, then the wind could cause untold damage blowing through an open house.Once I’d done the inside, I donned a heavy coat and boots and went outside. The garden furniture needed storing away, and once that was done, I checked for anything else loose and tied it down or shoved it in the garage. I’d just finished everything when my phone beeped, and I looked down. A message popped up from Rock telling me to head to the clubhouse, as the weather warnings had been ramped up. I glanced at the sky and was startled to see how black and heavy it was looking. Distant thunder rumbled, and I knew the storm would reach us soon.I jogged inside and grabbed the keys to Rock’s beloved Charger, and ran out to the garage. The thunder sounded closer now, and I didn’t hesitate throttling the car. I had just reached Jackson Blvd when the sky opened, and the rain came down heavily. Even though the Charger’s windscreen wipers worked frantically, I had to slow to a crawl because visibility was zero. Bright headlights flooded my back window, and I cursed at the idiot who was fast coming up my ass. Peering through the window, I saw a spot to pull over and let the asshole go past.Instead, to my surprise, the asshole pulled in behind, and I wondered if it was one of the Rage brothers. Some of them had trucks and SUVs. Unsure whether to get out of the car or not, I hesitated. But the decision was taken from my hands when the door was yanked open, and a fist flew towards my face. The last thing I saw was Otis’s gloating grin.",

      "content": "Chapter Seven.Otis took the corner far too fast as the wheels skidded on the slick road surface. The rain fell heavier now, making visibility poor, and it was too dangerous to be driving in. Let alone at the speed Otis was driving. Otis took the turning on Sheridan Lake Road and spun us onto the Old State Highway 40. The sky was blacker than black. I’d never seen it so heavy and dark. Clouds rolled and crashed together, and I knew Otis needed to slow down. Luckily for me, Hans was busy holding on to the oh shit strap and cursing Otis under his breath. Ha, Hans didn’t look so cocky or arrogant now.Muttering, Otis thumped the beat-up Sat Nav that had never worked right, and I smothered a smile as I realised he was doubling back on himself towards Highway 44. Otis just kept proving what a complete idiot he was. After Otis had knocked me out, I’d woken up in Otis’s truck with Hans greedily grinning at me and stroking my leg.“Otis, you need to slow,” I said, and Otis cursed. Hans turned to me.“What? So you can escape, princess?” Hans sneered.“Nope, because the weather gave out flood warnings, and you may be racing straight into them. There’s no one on the streets, Otis; people have already been evacuated from this area, asshole. There was a flood in 1972, and it destroyed loads of property and people. You heading into the Hills makes you fools,” I said. I didn’t want to go up there; I could sense something was wrong. And I didn’t want to hang around to discover what lay ahead.“The cabin’s up in the Hills, once we get Carly there, they won’t find her,” Otis said, and I laughed.“Did you not hear me? Dimwits, we can’t go into the Hills; they were warning of flash flooding,” I yelled.“When we get to the cabin, the flash flooding will keep your fuckin’ friends away,” Otis snarled, and I rolled my eyes. The truck’s tyres slipped on the road, and I knew slowly, but surely the car was losing traction.“Christ sake Otis, I’m not a virgin anymore. My man took it, so stop this bullshit. Our lives aren’t worth the risk!” I yelled.“What!” Hans yelled, turning a black look on me.“Yeah, asshole, you missed your chance,” I sneered.“Maybe, but you just opened yourself to a world of pain; I bought your virginity!” Hans seethed.“I didn’t sell it to you, asshole; I did not agree to be raped by you,” I yelled.“Shut the fuck up, Carly!” Otis yelled as the car skidded, and I yelped.“For fuck’s sake, Otis, no one will get to the cabin in this,” I said and screamed as a lightning bolt hit a tree near to us. Crap, that was close. “Otis, stop!” I screamed, and finally, Hans looked worried.“The cabin is around here, shut up,” Otis snarled and twisted the wheel, fighting the water running down the road. Frightened, I held my breath as we passed Nameless Cave Road. My home was there. If I could get out of this damned truck, I’d be able to get home and find a weapon. The road flashed past, and I cursed silently. I needed a miracle to get out of this alive. Otis began cursing furiously as the tail end of the truck started moving with the water. A quick glance outside confirmed my suspicions. The water flowing downhill was fast becoming a problem, and the truck couldn’t gain traction.There was only one way this shitty mess was ending. And I planned to survive. Wishing them to hell, I rolled off the seat and curled into the footwell of the backseat. Hans shot a look over his shoulder and sneered. Let Hans mock; his will be the head bouncing off the glass. Yeah, Otis had mad driving skills, but no one was going to keep a vehicle on this road. No soon had the thoughts left my head lightning struck, and a loud crack screamed across the Hills. Shrilly screaming, I covered my head with my hands and assumed the crash position.The back end of the truck flipped out, and Otis struggled to keep it on the road. The back hit something hard, sending a tearing noise through the inside, and the truck spun, hitting something else hard and was shoved backwards. Shit, we didn’t want to be going backwards down a ravine! Metal screamed as Otis still tried to stupidly control the truck, but it was far too late. The truck began gathering speed as we rolled backwards, and Otis cried out the brakes weren’t working. Give the genius a prize, everyone! Glass smashed, and I screamed as rain flew in the windows, soaking me on the floor.The truck hit something hard, so hard I felt the back crumple under the impact, but it didn’t stop there. The vehicle spun 180 degrees as the front tyres kept moving, and we began sliding forward before hitting something again hard. Finally, we stopped moving. Warily I glanced up, and although there were cuts to my hands and arms from protecting me, they’d heal. The truck gave an indignant hiss and settled. A thick branch had come through the front window, and as I pushed my shoulders back against my door, it opened a little and stuck.I could see Hans hanging in his seat, unconscious and blood dripping down his face. Otis, I couldn’t see because of the leafy branch covering his body. As I scrabbled to my knees, I cut them on a large piece of glass and swore. That had really hurt. Roughly pushing my bound hands in front of me, I began sawing back and forth to gain freedom. The ropes frayed, and I struggled for a few minutes before my hands were freed. Panicked, I kicked at the opposite door, and to my surprise, it gave way and opened. Trying not to cry as glass cut into my hands, I pulled myself forward and fell out into the rain and wind. The sky was so black it appeared night. No time to hesitate. I needed help and checked my pockets for my phone, only to remember Otis had taken it.Gingerly I pulled myself to my feet, and luckily it didn’t seem I’d broken any bones. I held onto the door as rain lashed me, and I wiped the water from my face. The wind blew the door shut, and I walked round to Otis’s side. My brother lay silent with his head outside the window, and I wondered if Otis was dead. No lie, I felt more than a little squeamish touching Otis, but I reached out and patted him down. I found my phone in his front pocket. The screen smashed and switched off, but I held out hope. Desperately, I brushed my hair out of my eyes and jumped again as lightning hit close by me.The weather had been very wrong. The weather channel mentioned a storm, but this raging nightmare was more than a storm. This was hell on earth. Otis’s eyes snapped open, and I cried out as he stared at me, dazed. Without a second thought, I took off, scrambling to escape. I’d had a few moments before searching Otis to get my bearings. The truck had been forced off the road and down a steep, jagged incline. The car had crashed to a halt against the trees, so the only way to go was up.In the pouring rain, without good visibility, I had to scramble up the slope. Loudly, I cursed the fact I’d sneakers on and a sweater, but no coat or boots. My jeans were soaked through already. Frantic to escape, I grabbed tree roots to haul myself up and finally reached the top. I took a couple of deep breaths and turned to jog down the road towards home when I froze in horror. Below me, the creek had flooded the road, and there was nothing to be seen. A fast-running, well, small river flowed across the road, and I shivered in the chilly air. There was only one way to go, and that was up. Two torch lights lit the darkness below me.Without hesitation, I set off at a steady pace. Otis and Hans wouldn’t catch me again, not without a seriously bitter fight. Yeah, I was wet, sore and miserable, but that was nothing compared to getting away from those two. I wasn’t sure whether to stay on the road or disappear into the forest. The choice was taken out of my hands when a torch swept close to me on the road, and I dived into the bushes to hide. They’d be running on an even flat surface, and I’d be slowed by trees, rocks and bushes, but at least I’d have cover.The rain hid much of the noise I made, and I was soaked through and thoroughly miserable. I ducked below tree branches swinging in the strong winds and kept heading upwards. I needed to find somewhere to shack up, a hut or cave perhaps. Just somewhere I could hole up, dry out, and rest. A twig snapped loudly near me, and I crouched amongst the mud and bushes, wondering if I’d been found. My eyes tiredly searched the darkness, but I couldn’t see a flash of light giving away a torch.Quietly, I moved forward, keeping low and trying to keep a lookout. Rock would come for me; someone would get word back to Rage that Otis and Hans had snatched me. Rock’s Charger was open and abandoned on the side of the road. Someone would find it. So the primary goal was to survive until this rain stopped and Rock found me. I ducked under a bush, wanting to check if my phone would work. Fingers metaphorically crossed and huddled in a ball to hide any sign of light, I pressed the on button and prayed. A few seconds later, my prayer was dashed when the screen stayed dark. The urge to rail against my circumstances nearly overwhelmed me, but I kept pushing onwards. Otis and Hans were out there somewhere.◆◆◆ “Did you get the alert?” Drake asked as he walked into Rage.“Yeah, the roads are flooding by the creek; mountain rescue is calling for help. People are trapped, and there’s been one mudslide, and they’re expecting more. Medics are setting up triage, but they’re swamped,” Ace replied as he pulled on wet gear. Drake looked around the clubhouse.“No one ride bikes; we go in four-wheel drives,” Drake said, checking who was present. The year they’d got Rage clean, they’d all signed on for mountain rescue, the start of Rage putting something back into their city. Rage usually did a week or two volunteering each year.“The entire area is a cesspit. Reports of roads running free with water, cars being stranded, and people trapped. The creek has burst its banks in four places, and it’s a total mess up there. Trees are down, and one team has been caught up and isolated. Too risky to fly a chopper in at this time,” Ace updated everyone.Present was the entire MC, all would be going out on the rescues bar Axel and Texas who were to stay at base camp and help organise teams to respond to calls. The prospects were tasked with being dogsbodies, fetching food, drink, medical kits, and driving vehicles to free up an EMT. They strode towards the cars and climbed in, heading for base camp at Deadman’s Gulch.Rock tried calling Carly to let her know what was happening, but Carly’s phone rang out. He imagined Carly was at home, tucked up safely, and that she hadn’t tried to reach the clubhouse.“Drake, are our homes safe?” Rock asked.“Yeah, our roads are clear, but there’s a lot in the Hills that aren’t,” Drake replied as he checked his rescue backpack, and his radio was working. Soon enough, they pulled up at Deadman Gulch and exited. People were hurrying, trying to get tents set up against the wind blowing them around the emergency camp. Drake motioned, and the prospects made their way over to help. He lifted a hand when three black SUVs arrived, and the men of Hawthorne Investigations arrived.“Who’s in charge?” Dylan Hawthorne asked.“Just arrived. I think the command tent is over there,” Drake said, pointing. Together they began walking in that direction as the storm blew around them. Inside the command tent, they discovered Chief Andre Howser of Rapid City police and the fire department Chief Bill Hawthorne, Dylan’s uncle.“What we got?” Drake asked as several other teams gathered around the table.“The road has washed out just above Elkhart Road, and we’ve people trapped there and including Blake Road. Johnson Siding Station two is covering the area around Cavern Road. The creek has washed out the road at the Naylor’s on the first tight bend on Dark Canyon Road. Anyone above that is trapped, and several have reported mudslides in the area too. Teams are going in six men to a team. No arguments, the situation is dangerous, and you’ll need the extra men,” Chief Hawthorne said.“Bill and I are staying here coordinating. You get diverted, you get trapped, see something hinky; we want to know. Do not risk yourselves in a stupid attempt at heroism, or you’ll never work search and rescue again. Each team is taking a dog handler with them, which makes you seven men. Bill has your teams and assignments,” Chief Howser said. Everyone moved around, looking for team leaders as Bill stood in front of a whiteboard with names written on it. The chief split them up, and Rock and Drake found themselves on the same team as Hawthorne, Officer Lucas and three fire and rescue. Together they formed Blue Team. Grimly they checked radios and headed out, as even more calls came from the families trapped in the Hills.◆◆◆ I no longer knew which way was up or down, left or right. And I’d lost sight of the road ages back when Otis had spotted me and given chase. In my haste to escape, I’d slipped and slid down a hill to get away and rolled into a ditch. I’d become so caked in mud that when Otis had literally stopped within an arm’s length, he’d not seen me.Tiredness had seeped into my bones, along with the bitter chill of the storm and the piercing wetness of the rain. The storm still raged, mother nature showing her power, and it had been roaring for hours. Wet through, I was shaking so badly I knew I’d catch a severe cold. The truth of the matter was, I was completely and utterly lost. My phone had an app that would have picked up my GPS and led me home, but it was useless. For now, I needed somewhere dry to hole up and safe to rest. Branches crunched from behind, and I wearily lifted my head and stared into the malevolent gaze of Hans. Surprised, I fell backwards as Hans lurched forward and sank a hand into my matted hair.And deep inside, my anger lit. I was finished with being pushed around by men who’d no respect for my wishes and desires or my right to live as I saw fit. I was finished being their wet blanket and punching bag. My hand scrabbled in the dirt, and I grabbed a handful of mud, and as Hans swung me around by my hair, I threw the mud in his face. Shakily, I leapt to my feet as Hans roared and clawed at the muck on his face. Clumsily, I fell against a tree after a few steps, and my hand caught on a heavy branch.“No!” I shouted in Han’s face, and as he reached for me, I swung the branch and knocked him straight on his back. Without hesitation, I swung the branch a second time and a third and fourth. Satisfied Hans wouldn’t be getting up soon, I began stumbling away, keeping an eye open for Otis. He couldn’t be far away if Hans was this close. I couldn’t imagine they’d split up.A low rumbling noise echoed off the surrounding inclines, and I glanced around warily. That hadn’t sounded too good. I was aware mudslides had happened in the Black Hills over the years. And I was fully aware that the Rapid Creek had flooded many years ago, and it had affected the Keystone area of Rapid City. There was a shout from behind, and I glanced back to see Otis scrambling towards me with a gun out. Otis fired one shot as a warning, and I dived to the slope and began scrambling up it.◆◆◆ “Reports of gunshots,” Red leader called over the radio, and Drake listened to the coordinates.“That’s near to us,” Hawthorne said, checking the GPS. They’d been in the Hills for several hours now and had performed several rescues.“This fucker needs to break,” Rock grumbled, eyeing the sky.“Not known a storm to last so long,” Drake agreed.“We’re going to head over that way; we’re better equipped. Red Team has two injuries they’re bringing in. May be someone calling for help or someone in trouble,” Officer Lucas said, and the others nodded.“You got the coordinates?” Drake asked, and Lucas nodded.“Yeah, I’ll take point,” Lucas said and checked everyone’s equipment over. They heard a loud rumble and swapped wary gazes.◆◆◆ The rumble came from above me, and I looked up and yelped as I saw the trees moving in the darkness. Trees didn’t move! Terrified and wondering what new horror I was witnessing. I saw the trees heading towards me and picking up speed. Shit, it wasn’t the trees moving; it was a mudslide and a large one at that. I frantically crawled sideways, no longer caring that Otis was behind me. The trees were coming towards me ever quicker, and the rumble was turning into a roar. Desperately wanting to cover my ears but aware of the danger heading towards me, I gave an almighty kick just as the edges of the mudslide clipped my legs.The force of the flowing mud knocked me aside and out of range and luckily not into it. Stretching, I reached for a tree branch and clung on tightly as mud flowed past me with trees, bushes, rocks, and other debris. There was only a foot between me and the flow. Although the sound was a roar, there was a dullness to it; it was a horrifying sound and one I knew would haunt me. Well, it would as long as I survived this, alive and intact.In survival mode, I drew my knee’s up and clung to the tree branch, and after several long minutes, the flood dropped to a slow trickle. Gasping for breath, I gazed around and couldn’t believe my eyes when I spied Otis clinging to a tree in the middle of the flood. His waist and hips were covered by the mud, and he looked to be hurt. Even then, Otis sneered, and to my disbelief, he drew a line of sight on me. I flipped him the finger and disappeared into the undergrowth. Fuck him and fuck helping him; Otis could go hang. ◆◆◆ “Man down,” Lucas called as they entered a small clearing. He withdrew his sidearm as he approached and forewarned Drake. Rock, and Hawthorne drew theirs.“What is it?” Drake asked, blinking rain out of his eyes.“Man’s been attacked, hit hard with the branch. Hey, you two, get over here,” Lucas called to the medics. They radioed in their position, and they watched as they rolled the man over and went to lay him on a backboard. Rock glimpsed something pink and leapt forward.“Wait,” he said and knelt in the mud and picked up a mud-covered phone. Rock’s guts twisted as he recognised the case, and he didn’t need to see the name on the back. Grimly Rock turned the phone and showed Drake the back. Drake’s jaw dropped open as Hawthorne leaned forward. Rock bent over the beaten man and began patting him down.“What the hell, Rock?” Officer Lucas demanded.“That’s Carly’s. The only reason Carly’s phone would be under that cunt, is if she was running. Carly’s out here somewhere, and I think she’s running from her brothers,” Rock growled, his gaze sweeping the forest. Shit, his girl was out here, maybe hurt, definitely scared, and Carly was running with no idea of where she was going. In the best conditions, the Black Hills were dangerous. Right now? They were lethal. The storm was abating, but it would remain hazardous for a while as the land settled.“Which way?” Rock asked, twisting his head.“Rock, we can’t leave him,” Officer Lucas said.“No, you can’t leave him; we can. That fucker had my girl. I’m looking for her. He can fuckin’ drown for all I care,” Rock said, and Lucas stared at him and decided.“You three go on ahead; I’m following these three down. If this man’s a criminal, I can’t leave them alone with him. Keep your radio on you and radio your position every five minutes, you agree, or you don’t go,” Lucas demanded, and they nodded.“Let’s go find Carly,” Rock said and began walking.◆◆◆ I crawled under an overhang that had fronds trailing, hiding it, and camouflaged my figure from anyone tracking. The truth was, I needed to start a fire, but everything was soaking wet, and plus, it would lead Otis to me. To keep warm, I huddled under the ledge and rubbed my hands up and down my legs. My fingers were turning blue, and I was sure my waterlogged boots were making my toes the same. But hey, I’d rather lose a finger or toe than lose my life. The storm was on its last legs, having finally blown itself out, and I shoved my mess of hair out of my eyes and tried to get my bearings.For a few moments, I allowed myself to imagine a roaring log fire, thick woollen blankets and thick, cosy socks. Then reality bit as Otis stumbled into view. He was shouting and cursing, and I realised Otis was trying to track my footprints. Damn it, I should have learned. Cautiously I slipped out from the ledge as Otis faced away from me and towards a cliff face.Without heed or caution, I raced away, knowing Otis still held that gun. It took Otis a few moments to discover my whereabouts, and when the weapon spat, I knew he was behind me. The fact he didn’t gain on me meant Otis was injured because I was not moving swiftly. Heart in my throat, I ran as best as I could through the foliage, scratching my legs and arms and not caring. Better them than the consequences should Otis catch me. I tripped over a tree root that the recent rain had uncovered and tumbled down a steep incline. Landing at the bottom winded me, and I banged my head hard. I wasn’t sure if I had the strength to continue. The cold was too insidious, and bone-weary tiredness claimed me. My will, focus, and strength drained from me, and I lay there, dazed and lost.Minutes ticked by, hell hours may have ticked by, I’ve no idea, but a hand sank into my hair and began dragging me away from where I lay. It was Otis, but I didn’t have it to fight anymore. Due to the slickness of the mud, I was dragged easily backwards as Otis spat and swore at me. Otis was threatening nasty things, and I let it go over my head. Too tired, I couldn’t fight Otis now. I was frozen to the bone and worn out. But when I grew warmer and regained my strength, he’d be a eunuch before the night ended.Otis scrambled heedlessly in the mud, forcing rocks loose and tiny plants to come free. I tried to warn him to be careful, but as usual, my idiot brother didn’t use the brains that God gave him. A small rock hit me on the head, and I swallowed mud before gagging and spitting it out. I heard a slight rustle and knew Otis was disturbing the loose ground.“Are you so determined to kill us both?” I cried, and Otis howled.“You, yes. God damn you, Carly. All you had to do was spread ya legs and let Hans fuck you. Why was that so fuckin’ hard for ya? Oh, miss, high and mighty, always wanting better than where she came from. Just one fuck Carly,” Otis hollered.“This is my body. What right do you have to sell it?” I yelled as best I could.“Every right, we fed and clothed you,” Otis spat.“And Mom and Dad fed and clothed you, so should they have sold your virgin ass to a pervert?” I yelled.“I’m a man, worth more than a cunt,” Otis screamed. My hand grasped a rock, and I swung it upwards at him, smashing him in the kneecap. Otis fell on top of me, crying.“If I’m going to die, so are you!” I shrieked and hit Otis with the rock again, smashing his thigh. I kicked against his body and raked his face, and scrambled backwards.“You fuckin’ cunt!” Otis roared, trying to get to his feet.“Asshole, I hate you; I hate you!” I screamed and threw the rock. Wherever this surge of energy came from, I thanked it as I pulled myself up the steep slope.“Carly!” Rock bellowed, and I froze in shock, looking around for him.“Rock!” I screamed back, trying to see him. The rain had stopped, but night was approaching fast. I saw a flash of yellow from the peak above me, and I squinted. There, there were three beautiful figures in bright yellow.“Carly, get out of there. The grounds not stable,” Rock yelled.“No shit, Sherlock,” I muttered as I moved sideways.“Carly, we’re rappelling down. Get to a safe spot,” Drake called.“There isn’t one,” I called back. The third man shone a torch, seeking somewhere for me to climb to.“Carly, that big oak tree there, move towards that. The roots will be too deep in the ground to be pulled free, and it’s at the edge of the slide,” Dylan Hawthorne called.“Okay,” I said and turned ninety degrees to crawl towards the oak tree. The men above me kept doing what they were doing when Otis fired his gun at me. I yelped and dropped flat, face first in the mud, and my body went stiff, expecting pain. When no pain was forthcoming, I lifted my head and gazed at Otis with hate. A loud sound boomed off the hills, and I stared in horror as Rock, Drake, and Hawthorne dived to one side. To the left of the peak, they’d been standing on, came yet another mudslide, screaming and roaring as it drove towards me.This slide had me dead to right in its sights, and I struggled to reach the oak tree. Otis seeing my direction, moved that way too, but I beat him to it and tried to climb up its branches. The bark was too slippery, and I couldn’t catch hold. Rock’s horrified scream echoed in my ears, and the deluge swept me away. Otis gave a hoarse shout as he was smothered.I’d never felt so helpless as I struggled against the flood and tried to find a grab hold somewhere. My body was battered as I rolled and flipped in the fast-moving water and mud. I clawed for purchase while trying to keep my head above ground. With a jarring body slam, I crashed into something hard and spun in a different direction. The image of Rock roaring in horror was seared into my mind as I banged into heavy debris multiple times. Finally, my battered body fetched up against something.On instinct, I scrabbled for a hold and got my fingertips into a small crevasse. On instinct, I hauled myself closer, my heart pounding as the roaring of the flood surrounded me. My knees smashed into the tree, and I cried out and swallowed mud. Furiously, I spat it out and hooked an arm over the lower branch of the tree. Shit, it didn’t seem as sturdy as the oak I’d initially aimed at. No time for doubt, however, as the water swirled around me. I drew in a breath and, with a surge of energy, hauled myself further up the tree, but my waist and bottom half were trapped in the mud.But it didn’t matter how hard I tried to kick my legs free or pull myself clear of the sucking mud; I was truly trapped. Pins and needles shot down my bruised and cut legs, and I gave up fighting and chose to trust in God. Horrible smells from the debris milled around, making me want to gag. Fearfully, I understood that if I released this final lifeline, I’d be dead. There was no coming back from the deluge. The force would sweep me downstream, and I’d drown. A yell came from close by, and I gazed in horrified amusement as Otis was swept near me.His hand reached out, and I stared into his eyes. There was no inner voice, no little angel or devil on my shoulder. I held his gaze and denied him the lifeline Otis sought. Together we both understood that I only needed to reach out a hand and haul Otis to safety. Not today, not ever. Otis was a massive piece of shit, and I wouldn’t mourn him. Holding his scared eyes, I clung tighter to my tree and watched him as Otis was swallowed up, screaming.“See ya, asshole, may the devil take your soul,” I gasped. I don’t know how long I clung to that tree. My arms cramped, and the pain was a welcome relief from the cold and fear. Life would be far easier if I just let go. Because everything bad would float away and disappear in a few short minutes. I was facing a world of pain recovering, and it was tempting to let go.“Carly, hang in there!” Rock ordered, and even in my dazed state, I jumped. His voice echoed around the canyon, and I dully realised he’d used a bullhorn. It was the only way I could have heard him. The roaring water was too loud. Interested, I idly wondered how he’d save me from this mess. Fight rose in me, the will to fight for our life together, for our future children, for the promises we’d made each other. Fuck no, I wasn’t letting those go when they were within my grasp.Minutes ticked by, punctuated by the three men taking turns to call out encouragement to me as I clung to my little tree. Idly, I wondered how they’d reach me; the fast-moving water had slowed, but it was so very unsafe still. It was impossible to turn my head and see what they were doing and to be honest, it would take energy away from clinging to my position.Finally, I heard splashing sounds and frowned. What could be splashing near me? A yellow boat appeared in the corner of my eye, and I twisted my head a tiny little bit, and my eyes widened as Drake appeared in a yellow dinghy. It was attached to several ropes stopping it from sweeping past me as Drake battled to reach me. The mudflow had stopped, but now water flooded the surrounding area. The look of sheer determination to reach me on Drake’s face made me gasp. With a mighty heave, Drake paddled the dinghy, and it bumped against my tree.“Hold me in place,” Drake roared and turned to me. Drake fitted a safety harness to himself and attached it to the boat, and leant towards me.“Drake,” I stuttered.“Hold on, baby, you got to listen to me. I’m gonna bring this in closer, once I do, you keep holding on tightly until I get a harness around you. As soon as the harness is safe, I’ll tell you to let go. I know it’s going to be hard to trust me, but Carly, as soon as you let go, I’ll have you here safe,” Drake said. I listened intently and nodded.“Easy to trust you,” I said, and I saw my words touched Drake. He gave me one of his trademark chin lifts and moved the dinghy closer. I watched as Drake checked he was secure, and then he leant over the edge and fitted a harness around my waist. Drake couldn’t get it over my shoulders but secured it as best as he could.“Carly, let go and fall into my arms,” Drake ordered, and I didn’t hesitate before letting go. Strong arms caught and hauled me towards the dinghy. There was a moment of hard pulling, and Drake heaved me into the boat, and I collapsed on the floor. Drake yanked a thermal silver blanket out of a packet and tucked it in around me. As I lay there helplessly, Drake checked my vitals and dropped a kiss on my mucky head.“Carly’s safe; pull us back,” Drake roared and tucked me into his body as he used a paddle to guide debris away from him. Rock and Dylan pulled the dinghy to them, fighting against the current, but finally, they pulled it up safely to where they were.“Carly’s going to need carrying out. I couldn’t discern any life concerning injuries, but she’s hypothermic and has many cuts and bruises. Carly’s got a couple of head wounds, and I’m worried about her fingers and toes,” Drake summed up as Rock checked me over briskly. I was happily wavering between blackness and warmth.“Rock, get the backboard; don’t know if there’re any injuries to her spine. I’ve radioed in that we’ve a victim coming in, and EMTs are on standby for when we get out of here,” Dylan said. My gaze swapped between the three men barking orders. Rock’s large hand lightly touched my forehead and then cupped my face, and I gave up and closed my eyes and let the darkness swallow me.",

      "content": "Chapter Seven.Otis took the corner far too fast as the wheels skidded on the slick road surface. The rain fell heavier now, making visibility poor, and it was too dangerous to be driving in. Let alone at the speed Otis was driving. Otis took the turning on Sheridan Lake Road and spun us onto the Old State Highway 40. The sky was blacker than black. I’d never seen it so heavy and dark. Clouds rolled and crashed together, and I knew Otis needed to slow down. Luckily for me, Hans was busy holding on to the oh shit strap and cursing Otis under his breath. Ha, Hans didn’t look so cocky or arrogant now.Muttering, Otis thumped the beat-up Sat Nav that had never worked right, and I smothered a smile as I realised he was doubling back on himself towards Highway 44. Otis just kept proving what a complete idiot he was. After Otis had knocked me out, I’d woken up in Otis’s truck with Hans greedily grinning at me and stroking my leg.“Otis, you need to slow,” I said, and Otis cursed. Hans turned to me.“What? So you can escape, princess?” Hans sneered.“Nope, because the weather gave out flood warnings, and you may be racing straight into them. There’s no one on the streets, Otis; people have already been evacuated from this area, asshole. There was a flood in 1972, and it destroyed loads of property and people. You heading into the Hills makes you fools,” I said. I didn’t want to go up there; I could sense something was wrong. And I didn’t want to hang around to discover what lay ahead.“The cabin’s up in the Hills, once we get Carly there, they won’t find her,” Otis said, and I laughed.“Did you not hear me? Dimwits, we can’t go into the Hills; they were warning of flash flooding,” I yelled.“When we get to the cabin, the flash flooding will keep your fuckin’ friends away,” Otis snarled, and I rolled my eyes. The truck’s tyres slipped on the road, and I knew slowly, but surely the car was losing traction.“Christ sake Otis, I’m not a virgin anymore. My man took it, so stop this bullshit. Our lives aren’t worth the risk!” I yelled.“What!” Hans yelled, turning a black look on me.“Yeah, asshole, you missed your chance,” I sneered.“Maybe, but you just opened yourself to a world of pain; I bought your virginity!” Hans seethed.“I didn’t sell it to you, asshole; I did not agree to be raped by you,” I yelled.“Shut the fuck up, Carly!” Otis yelled as the car skidded, and I yelped.“For fuck’s sake, Otis, no one will get to the cabin in this,” I said and screamed as a lightning bolt hit a tree near to us. Crap, that was close. “Otis, stop!” I screamed, and finally, Hans looked worried.“The cabin is around here, shut up,” Otis snarled and twisted the wheel, fighting the water running down the road. Frightened, I held my breath as we passed Nameless Cave Road. My home was there. If I could get out of this damned truck, I’d be able to get home and find a weapon. The road flashed past, and I cursed silently. I needed a miracle to get out of this alive. Otis began cursing furiously as the tail end of the truck started moving with the water. A quick glance outside confirmed my suspicions. The water flowing downhill was fast becoming a problem, and the truck couldn’t gain traction.There was only one way this shitty mess was ending. And I planned to survive. Wishing them to hell, I rolled off the seat and curled into the footwell of the backseat. Hans shot a look over his shoulder and sneered. Let Hans mock; his will be the head bouncing off the glass. Yeah, Otis had mad driving skills, but no one was going to keep a vehicle on this road. No soon had the thoughts left my head lightning struck, and a loud crack screamed across the Hills. Shrilly screaming, I covered my head with my hands and assumed the crash position.The back end of the truck flipped out, and Otis struggled to keep it on the road. The back hit something hard, sending a tearing noise through the inside, and the truck spun, hitting something else hard and was shoved backwards. Shit, we didn’t want to be going backwards down a ravine! Metal screamed as Otis still tried to stupidly control the truck, but it was far too late. The truck began gathering speed as we rolled backwards, and Otis cried out the brakes weren’t working. Give the genius a prize, everyone! Glass smashed, and I screamed as rain flew in the windows, soaking me on the floor.The truck hit something hard, so hard I felt the back crumple under the impact, but it didn’t stop there. The vehicle spun 180 degrees as the front tyres kept moving, and we began sliding forward before hitting something again hard. Finally, we stopped moving. Warily I glanced up, and although there were cuts to my hands and arms from protecting me, they’d heal. The truck gave an indignant hiss and settled. A thick branch had come through the front window, and as I pushed my shoulders back against my door, it opened a little and stuck.I could see Hans hanging in his seat, unconscious and blood dripping down his face. Otis, I couldn’t see because of the leafy branch covering his body. As I scrabbled to my knees, I cut them on a large piece of glass and swore. That had really hurt. Roughly pushing my bound hands in front of me, I began sawing back and forth to gain freedom. The ropes frayed, and I struggled for a few minutes before my hands were freed. Panicked, I kicked at the opposite door, and to my surprise, it gave way and opened. Trying not to cry as glass cut into my hands, I pulled myself forward and fell out into the rain and wind. The sky was so black it appeared night. No time to hesitate. I needed help and checked my pockets for my phone, only to remember Otis had taken it.Gingerly I pulled myself to my feet, and luckily it didn’t seem I’d broken any bones. I held onto the door as rain lashed me, and I wiped the water from my face. The wind blew the door shut, and I walked round to Otis’s side. My brother lay silent with his head outside the window, and I wondered if Otis was dead. No lie, I felt more than a little squeamish touching Otis, but I reached out and patted him down. I found my phone in his front pocket. The screen smashed and switched off, but I held out hope. Desperately, I brushed my hair out of my eyes and jumped again as lightning hit close by me.The weather had been very wrong. The weather channel mentioned a storm, but this raging nightmare was more than a storm. This was hell on earth. Otis’s eyes snapped open, and I cried out as he stared at me, dazed. Without a second thought, I took off, scrambling to escape. I’d had a few moments before searching Otis to get my bearings. The truck had been forced off the road and down a steep, jagged incline. The car had crashed to a halt against the trees, so the only way to go was up.In the pouring rain, without good visibility, I had to scramble up the slope. Loudly, I cursed the fact I’d sneakers on and a sweater, but no coat or boots. My jeans were soaked through already. Frantic to escape, I grabbed tree roots to haul myself up and finally reached the top. I took a couple of deep breaths and turned to jog down the road towards home when I froze in horror. Below me, the creek had flooded the road, and there was nothing to be seen. A fast-running, well, small river flowed across the road, and I shivered in the chilly air. There was only one way to go, and that was up. Two torch lights lit the darkness below me.Without hesitation, I set off at a steady pace. Otis and Hans wouldn’t catch me again, not without a seriously bitter fight. Yeah, I was wet, sore and miserable, but that was nothing compared to getting away from those two. I wasn’t sure whether to stay on the road or disappear into the forest. The choice was taken out of my hands when a torch swept close to me on the road, and I dived into the bushes to hide. They’d be running on an even flat surface, and I’d be slowed by trees, rocks and bushes, but at least I’d have cover.The rain hid much of the noise I made, and I was soaked through and thoroughly miserable. I ducked below tree branches swinging in the strong winds and kept heading upwards. I needed to find somewhere to shack up, a hut or cave perhaps. Just somewhere I could hole up, dry out, and rest. A twig snapped loudly near me, and I crouched amongst the mud and bushes, wondering if I’d been found. My eyes tiredly searched the darkness, but I couldn’t see a flash of light giving away a torch.Quietly, I moved forward, keeping low and trying to keep a lookout. Rock would come for me; someone would get word back to Rage that Otis and Hans had snatched me. Rock’s Charger was open and abandoned on the side of the road. Someone would find it. So the primary goal was to survive until this rain stopped and Rock found me. I ducked under a bush, wanting to check if my phone would work. Fingers metaphorically crossed and huddled in a ball to hide any sign of light, I pressed the on button and prayed. A few seconds later, my prayer was dashed when the screen stayed dark. The urge to rail against my circumstances nearly overwhelmed me, but I kept pushing onwards. Otis and Hans were out there somewhere.◆◆◆ “Did you get the alert?” Drake asked as he walked into Rage.“Yeah, the roads are flooding by the creek; mountain rescue is calling for help. People are trapped, and there’s been one mudslide, and they’re expecting more. Medics are setting up triage, but they’re swamped,” Ace replied as he pulled on wet gear. Drake looked around the clubhouse.“No one ride bikes; we go in four-wheel drives,” Drake said, checking who was present. The year they’d got Rage clean, they’d all signed on for mountain rescue, the start of Rage putting something back into their city. Rage usually did a week or two volunteering each year.“The entire area is a cesspit. Reports of roads running free with water, cars being stranded, and people trapped. The creek has burst its banks in four places, and it’s a total mess up there. Trees are down, and one team has been caught up and isolated. Too risky to fly a chopper in at this time,” Ace updated everyone.Present was the entire MC, all would be going out on the rescues bar Axel and Texas who were to stay at base camp and help organise teams to respond to calls. The prospects were tasked with being dogsbodies, fetching food, drink, medical kits, and driving vehicles to free up an EMT. They strode towards the cars and climbed in, heading for base camp at Deadman’s Gulch.Rock tried calling Carly to let her know what was happening, but Carly’s phone rang out. He imagined Carly was at home, tucked up safely, and that she hadn’t tried to reach the clubhouse.“Drake, are our homes safe?” Rock asked.“Yeah, our roads are clear, but there’s a lot in the Hills that aren’t,” Drake replied as he checked his rescue backpack, and his radio was working. Soon enough, they pulled up at Deadman Gulch and exited. People were hurrying, trying to get tents set up against the wind blowing them around the emergency camp. Drake motioned, and the prospects made their way over to help. He lifted a hand when three black SUVs arrived, and the men of Hawthorne Investigations arrived.“Who’s in charge?” Dylan Hawthorne asked.“Just arrived. I think the command tent is over there,” Drake said, pointing. Together they began walking in that direction as the storm blew around them. Inside the command tent, they discovered Chief Andre Howser of Rapid City police and the fire department Chief Bill Hawthorne, Dylan’s uncle.“What we got?” Drake asked as several other teams gathered around the table.“The road has washed out just above Elkhart Road, and we’ve people trapped there and including Blake Road. Johnson Siding Station two is covering the area around Cavern Road. The creek has washed out the road at the Naylor’s on the first tight bend on Dark Canyon Road. Anyone above that is trapped, and several have reported mudslides in the area too. Teams are going in six men to a team. No arguments, the situation is dangerous, and you’ll need the extra men,” Chief Hawthorne said.“Bill and I are staying here coordinating. You get diverted, you get trapped, see something hinky; we want to know. Do not risk yourselves in a stupid attempt at heroism, or you’ll never work search and rescue again. Each team is taking a dog handler with them, which makes you seven men. Bill has your teams and assignments,” Chief Howser said. Everyone moved around, looking for team leaders as Bill stood in front of a whiteboard with names written on it. The chief split them up, and Rock and Drake found themselves on the same team as Hawthorne, Officer Lucas and three fire and rescue. Together they formed Blue Team. Grimly they checked radios and headed out, as even more calls came from the families trapped in the Hills.◆◆◆ I no longer knew which way was up or down, left or right. And I’d lost sight of the road ages back when Otis had spotted me and given chase. In my haste to escape, I’d slipped and slid down a hill to get away and rolled into a ditch. I’d become so caked in mud that when Otis had literally stopped within an arm’s length, he’d not seen me.Tiredness had seeped into my bones, along with the bitter chill of the storm and the piercing wetness of the rain. The storm still raged, mother nature showing her power, and it had been roaring for hours. Wet through, I was shaking so badly I knew I’d catch a severe cold. The truth of the matter was, I was completely and utterly lost. My phone had an app that would have picked up my GPS and led me home, but it was useless. For now, I needed somewhere dry to hole up and safe to rest. Branches crunched from behind, and I wearily lifted my head and stared into the malevolent gaze of Hans. Surprised, I fell backwards as Hans lurched forward and sank a hand into my matted hair.And deep inside, my anger lit. I was finished with being pushed around by men who’d no respect for my wishes and desires or my right to live as I saw fit. I was finished being their wet blanket and punching bag. My hand scrabbled in the dirt, and I grabbed a handful of mud, and as Hans swung me around by my hair, I threw the mud in his face. Shakily, I leapt to my feet as Hans roared and clawed at the muck on his face. Clumsily, I fell against a tree after a few steps, and my hand caught on a heavy branch.“No!” I shouted in Han’s face, and as he reached for me, I swung the branch and knocked him straight on his back. Without hesitation, I swung the branch a second time and a third and fourth. Satisfied Hans wouldn’t be getting up soon, I began stumbling away, keeping an eye open for Otis. He couldn’t be far away if Hans was this close. I couldn’t imagine they’d split up.A low rumbling noise echoed off the surrounding inclines, and I glanced around warily. That hadn’t sounded too good. I was aware mudslides had happened in the Black Hills over the years. And I was fully aware that the Rapid Creek had flooded many years ago, and it had affected the Keystone area of Rapid City. There was a shout from behind, and I glanced back to see Otis scrambling towards me with a gun out. Otis fired one shot as a warning, and I dived to the slope and began scrambling up it.◆◆◆ “Reports of gunshots,” Red leader called over the radio, and Drake listened to the coordinates.“That’s near to us,” Hawthorne said, checking the GPS. They’d been in the Hills for several hours now and had performed several rescues.“This fucker needs to break,” Rock grumbled, eyeing the sky.“Not known a storm to last so long,” Drake agreed.“We’re going to head over that way; we’re better equipped. Red Team has two injuries they’re bringing in. May be someone calling for help or someone in trouble,” Officer Lucas said, and the others nodded.“You got the coordinates?” Drake asked, and Lucas nodded.“Yeah, I’ll take point,” Lucas said and checked everyone’s equipment over. They heard a loud rumble and swapped wary gazes.◆◆◆ The rumble came from above me, and I looked up and yelped as I saw the trees moving in the darkness. Trees didn’t move! Terrified and wondering what new horror I was witnessing. I saw the trees heading towards me and picking up speed. Shit, it wasn’t the trees moving; it was a mudslide and a large one at that. I frantically crawled sideways, no longer caring that Otis was behind me. The trees were coming towards me ever quicker, and the rumble was turning into a roar. Desperately wanting to cover my ears but aware of the danger heading towards me, I gave an almighty kick just as the edges of the mudslide clipped my legs.The force of the flowing mud knocked me aside and out of range and luckily not into it. Stretching, I reached for a tree branch and clung on tightly as mud flowed past me with trees, bushes, rocks, and other debris. There was only a foot between me and the flow. Although the sound was a roar, there was a dullness to it; it was a horrifying sound and one I knew would haunt me. Well, it would as long as I survived this, alive and intact.In survival mode, I drew my knee’s up and clung to the tree branch, and after several long minutes, the flood dropped to a slow trickle. Gasping for breath, I gazed around and couldn’t believe my eyes when I spied Otis clinging to a tree in the middle of the flood. His waist and hips were covered by the mud, and he looked to be hurt. Even then, Otis sneered, and to my disbelief, he drew a line of sight on me. I flipped him the finger and disappeared into the undergrowth. Fuck him and fuck helping him; Otis could go hang. ◆◆◆ “Man down,” Lucas called as they entered a small clearing. He withdrew his sidearm as he approached and forewarned Drake. Rock, and Hawthorne drew theirs.“What is it?” Drake asked, blinking rain out of his eyes.“Man’s been attacked, hit hard with the branch. Hey, you two, get over here,” Lucas called to the medics. They radioed in their position, and they watched as they rolled the man over and went to lay him on a backboard. Rock glimpsed something pink and leapt forward.“Wait,” he said and knelt in the mud and picked up a mud-covered phone. Rock’s guts twisted as he recognised the case, and he didn’t need to see the name on the back. Grimly Rock turned the phone and showed Drake the back. Drake’s jaw dropped open as Hawthorne leaned forward. Rock bent over the beaten man and began patting him down.“What the hell, Rock?” Officer Lucas demanded.“That’s Carly’s. The only reason Carly’s phone would be under that cunt, is if she was running. Carly’s out here somewhere, and I think she’s running from her brothers,” Rock growled, his gaze sweeping the forest. Shit, his girl was out here, maybe hurt, definitely scared, and Carly was running with no idea of where she was going. In the best conditions, the Black Hills were dangerous. Right now? They were lethal. The storm was abating, but it would remain hazardous for a while as the land settled.“Which way?” Rock asked, twisting his head.“Rock, we can’t leave him,” Officer Lucas said.“No, you can’t leave him; we can. That fucker had my girl. I’m looking for her. He can fuckin’ drown for all I care,” Rock said, and Lucas stared at him and decided.“You three go on ahead; I’m following these three down. If this man’s a criminal, I can’t leave them alone with him. Keep your radio on you and radio your position every five minutes, you agree, or you don’t go,” Lucas demanded, and they nodded.“Let’s go find Carly,” Rock said and began walking.◆◆◆ I crawled under an overhang that had fronds trailing, hiding it, and camouflaged my figure from anyone tracking. The truth was, I needed to start a fire, but everything was soaking wet, and plus, it would lead Otis to me. To keep warm, I huddled under the ledge and rubbed my hands up and down my legs. My fingers were turning blue, and I was sure my waterlogged boots were making my toes the same. But hey, I’d rather lose a finger or toe than lose my life. The storm was on its last legs, having finally blown itself out, and I shoved my mess of hair out of my eyes and tried to get my bearings.For a few moments, I allowed myself to imagine a roaring log fire, thick woollen blankets and thick, cosy socks. Then reality bit as Otis stumbled into view. He was shouting and cursing, and I realised Otis was trying to track my footprints. Damn it, I should have learned. Cautiously I slipped out from the ledge as Otis faced away from me and towards a cliff face.Without heed or caution, I raced away, knowing Otis still held that gun. It took Otis a few moments to discover my whereabouts, and when the weapon spat, I knew he was behind me. The fact he didn’t gain on me meant Otis was injured because I was not moving swiftly. Heart in my throat, I ran as best as I could through the foliage, scratching my legs and arms and not caring. Better them than the consequences should Otis catch me. I tripped over a tree root that the recent rain had uncovered and tumbled down a steep incline. Landing at the bottom winded me, and I banged my head hard. I wasn’t sure if I had the strength to continue. The cold was too insidious, and bone-weary tiredness claimed me. My will, focus, and strength drained from me, and I lay there, dazed and lost.Minutes ticked by, hell hours may have ticked by, I’ve no idea, but a hand sank into my hair and began dragging me away from where I lay. It was Otis, but I didn’t have it to fight anymore. Due to the slickness of the mud, I was dragged easily backwards as Otis spat and swore at me. Otis was threatening nasty things, and I let it go over my head. Too tired, I couldn’t fight Otis now. I was frozen to the bone and worn out. But when I grew warmer and regained my strength, he’d be a eunuch before the night ended.Otis scrambled heedlessly in the mud, forcing rocks loose and tiny plants to come free. I tried to warn him to be careful, but as usual, my idiot brother didn’t use the brains that God gave him. A small rock hit me on the head, and I swallowed mud before gagging and spitting it out. I heard a slight rustle and knew Otis was disturbing the loose ground.“Are you so determined to kill us both?” I cried, and Otis howled.“You, yes. God damn you, Carly. All you had to do was spread ya legs and let Hans fuck you. Why was that so fuckin’ hard for ya? Oh, miss, high and mighty, always wanting better than where she came from. Just one fuck Carly,” Otis hollered.“This is my body. What right do you have to sell it?” I yelled as best I could.“Every right, we fed and clothed you,” Otis spat.“And Mom and Dad fed and clothed you, so should they have sold your virgin ass to a pervert?” I yelled.“I’m a man, worth more than a cunt,” Otis screamed. My hand grasped a rock, and I swung it upwards at him, smashing him in the kneecap. Otis fell on top of me, crying.“If I’m going to die, so are you!” I shrieked and hit Otis with the rock again, smashing his thigh. I kicked against his body and raked his face, and scrambled backwards.“You fuckin’ cunt!” Otis roared, trying to get to his feet.“Asshole, I hate you; I hate you!” I screamed and threw the rock. Wherever this surge of energy came from, I thanked it as I pulled myself up the steep slope.“Carly!” Rock bellowed, and I froze in shock, looking around for him.“Rock!” I screamed back, trying to see him. The rain had stopped, but night was approaching fast. I saw a flash of yellow from the peak above me, and I squinted. There, there were three beautiful figures in bright yellow.“Carly, get out of there. The grounds not stable,” Rock yelled.“No shit, Sherlock,” I muttered as I moved sideways.“Carly, we’re rappelling down. Get to a safe spot,” Drake called.“There isn’t one,” I called back. The third man shone a torch, seeking somewhere for me to climb to.“Carly, that big oak tree there, move towards that. The roots will be too deep in the ground to be pulled free, and it’s at the edge of the slide,” Dylan Hawthorne called.“Okay,” I said and turned ninety degrees to crawl towards the oak tree. The men above me kept doing what they were doing when Otis fired his gun at me. I yelped and dropped flat, face first in the mud, and my body went stiff, expecting pain. When no pain was forthcoming, I lifted my head and gazed at Otis with hate. A loud sound boomed off the hills, and I stared in horror as Rock, Drake, and Hawthorne dived to one side. To the left of the peak, they’d been standing on, came yet another mudslide, screaming and roaring as it drove towards me.This slide had me dead to right in its sights, and I struggled to reach the oak tree. Otis seeing my direction, moved that way too, but I beat him to it and tried to climb up its branches. The bark was too slippery, and I couldn’t catch hold. Rock’s horrified scream echoed in my ears, and the deluge swept me away. Otis gave a hoarse shout as he was smothered.I’d never felt so helpless as I struggled against the flood and tried to find a grab hold somewhere. My body was battered as I rolled and flipped in the fast-moving water and mud. I clawed for purchase while trying to keep my head above ground. With a jarring body slam, I crashed into something hard and spun in a different direction. The image of Rock roaring in horror was seared into my mind as I banged into heavy debris multiple times. Finally, my battered body fetched up against something.On instinct, I scrabbled for a hold and got my fingertips into a small crevasse. On instinct, I hauled myself closer, my heart pounding as the roaring of the flood surrounded me. My knees smashed into the tree, and I cried out and swallowed mud. Furiously, I spat it out and hooked an arm over the lower branch of the tree. Shit, it didn’t seem as sturdy as the oak I’d initially aimed at. No time for doubt, however, as the water swirled around me. I drew in a breath and, with a surge of energy, hauled myself further up the tree, but my waist and bottom half were trapped in the mud.But it didn’t matter how hard I tried to kick my legs free or pull myself clear of the sucking mud; I was truly trapped. Pins and needles shot down my bruised and cut legs, and I gave up fighting and chose to trust in God. Horrible smells from the debris milled around, making me want to gag. Fearfully, I understood that if I released this final lifeline, I’d be dead. There was no coming back from the deluge. The force would sweep me downstream, and I’d drown. A yell came from close by, and I gazed in horrified amusement as Otis was swept near me.His hand reached out, and I stared into his eyes. There was no inner voice, no little angel or devil on my shoulder. I held his gaze and denied him the lifeline Otis sought. Together we both understood that I only needed to reach out a hand and haul Otis to safety. Not today, not ever. Otis was a massive piece of shit, and I wouldn’t mourn him. Holding his scared eyes, I clung tighter to my tree and watched him as Otis was swallowed up, screaming.“See ya, asshole, may the devil take your soul,” I gasped. I don’t know how long I clung to that tree. My arms cramped, and the pain was a welcome relief from the cold and fear. Life would be far easier if I just let go. Because everything bad would float away and disappear in a few short minutes. I was facing a world of pain recovering, and it was tempting to let go.“Carly, hang in there!” Rock ordered, and even in my dazed state, I jumped. His voice echoed around the canyon, and I dully realised he’d used a bullhorn. It was the only way I could have heard him. The roaring water was too loud. Interested, I idly wondered how he’d save me from this mess. Fight rose in me, the will to fight for our life together, for our future children, for the promises we’d made each other. Fuck no, I wasn’t letting those go when they were within my grasp.Minutes ticked by, punctuated by the three men taking turns to call out encouragement to me as I clung to my little tree. Idly, I wondered how they’d reach me; the fast-moving water had slowed, but it was so very unsafe still. It was impossible to turn my head and see what they were doing and to be honest, it would take energy away from clinging to my position.Finally, I heard splashing sounds and frowned. What could be splashing near me? A yellow boat appeared in the corner of my eye, and I twisted my head a tiny little bit, and my eyes widened as Drake appeared in a yellow dinghy. It was attached to several ropes stopping it from sweeping past me as Drake battled to reach me. The mudflow had stopped, but now water flooded the surrounding area. The look of sheer determination to reach me on Drake’s face made me gasp. With a mighty heave, Drake paddled the dinghy, and it bumped against my tree.“Hold me in place,” Drake roared and turned to me. Drake fitted a safety harness to himself and attached it to the boat, and leant towards me.“Drake,” I stuttered.“Hold on, baby, you got to listen to me. I’m gonna bring this in closer, once I do, you keep holding on tightly until I get a harness around you. As soon as the harness is safe, I’ll tell you to let go. I know it’s going to be hard to trust me, but Carly, as soon as you let go, I’ll have you here safe,” Drake said. I listened intently and nodded.“Easy to trust you,” I said, and I saw my words touched Drake. He gave me one of his trademark chin lifts and moved the dinghy closer. I watched as Drake checked he was secure, and then he leant over the edge and fitted a harness around my waist. Drake couldn’t get it over my shoulders but secured it as best as he could.“Carly, let go and fall into my arms,” Drake ordered, and I didn’t hesitate before letting go. Strong arms caught and hauled me towards the dinghy. There was a moment of hard pulling, and Drake heaved me into the boat, and I collapsed on the floor. Drake yanked a thermal silver blanket out of a packet and tucked it in around me. As I lay there helplessly, Drake checked my vitals and dropped a kiss on my mucky head.“Carly’s safe; pull us back,” Drake roared and tucked me into his body as he used a paddle to guide debris away from him. Rock and Dylan pulled the dinghy to them, fighting against the current, but finally, they pulled it up safely to where they were.“Carly’s going to need carrying out. I couldn’t discern any life concerning injuries, but she’s hypothermic and has many cuts and bruises. Carly’s got a couple of head wounds, and I’m worried about her fingers and toes,” Drake summed up as Rock checked me over briskly. I was happily wavering between blackness and warmth.“Rock, get the backboard; don’t know if there’re any injuries to her spine. I’ve radioed in that we’ve a victim coming in, and EMTs are on standby for when we get out of here,” Dylan said. My gaze swapped between the three men barking orders. Rock’s large hand lightly touched my forehead and then cupped my face, and I gave up and closed my eyes and let the darkness swallow me.",

      "content": "Chapter Seven.Otis took the corner far too fast as the wheels skidded on the slick road surface. The rain fell heavier now, making visibility poor, and it was too dangerous to be driving in. Let alone at the speed Otis was driving. Otis took the turning on Sheridan Lake Road and spun us onto the Old State Highway 40. The sky was blacker than black. I’d never seen it so heavy and dark. Clouds rolled and crashed together, and I knew Otis needed to slow down. Luckily for me, Hans was busy holding on to the oh shit strap and cursing Otis under his breath. Ha, Hans didn’t look so cocky or arrogant now.Muttering, Otis thumped the beat-up Sat Nav that had never worked right, and I smothered a smile as I realised he was doubling back on himself towards Highway 44. Otis just kept proving what a complete idiot he was. After Otis had knocked me out, I’d woken up in Otis’s truck with Hans greedily grinning at me and stroking my leg.“Otis, you need to slow,” I said, and Otis cursed. Hans turned to me.“What? So you can escape, princess?” Hans sneered.“Nope, because the weather gave out flood warnings, and you may be racing straight into them. There’s no one on the streets, Otis; people have already been evacuated from this area, asshole. There was a flood in 1972, and it destroyed loads of property and people. You heading into the Hills makes you fools,” I said. I didn’t want to go up there; I could sense something was wrong. And I didn’t want to hang around to discover what lay ahead.“The cabin’s up in the Hills, once we get Carly there, they won’t find her,” Otis said, and I laughed.“Did you not hear me? Dimwits, we can’t go into the Hills; they were warning of flash flooding,” I yelled.“When we get to the cabin, the flash flooding will keep your fuckin’ friends away,” Otis snarled, and I rolled my eyes. The truck’s tyres slipped on the road, and I knew slowly, but surely the car was losing traction.“Christ sake Otis, I’m not a virgin anymore. My man took it, so stop this bullshit. Our lives aren’t worth the risk!” I yelled.“What!” Hans yelled, turning a black look on me.“Yeah, asshole, you missed your chance,” I sneered.“Maybe, but you just opened yourself to a world of pain; I bought your virginity!” Hans seethed.“I didn’t sell it to you, asshole; I did not agree to be raped by you,” I yelled.“Shut the fuck up, Carly!” Otis yelled as the car skidded, and I yelped.“For fuck’s sake, Otis, no one will get to the cabin in this,” I said and screamed as a lightning bolt hit a tree near to us. Crap, that was close. “Otis, stop!” I screamed, and finally, Hans looked worried.“The cabin is around here, shut up,” Otis snarled and twisted the wheel, fighting the water running down the road. Frightened, I held my breath as we passed Nameless Cave Road. My home was there. If I could get out of this damned truck, I’d be able to get home and find a weapon. The road flashed past, and I cursed silently. I needed a miracle to get out of this alive. Otis began cursing furiously as the tail end of the truck started moving with the water. A quick glance outside confirmed my suspicions. The water flowing downhill was fast becoming a problem, and the truck couldn’t gain traction.There was only one way this shitty mess was ending. And I planned to survive. Wishing them to hell, I rolled off the seat and curled into the footwell of the backseat. Hans shot a look over his shoulder and sneered. Let Hans mock; his will be the head bouncing off the glass. Yeah, Otis had mad driving skills, but no one was going to keep a vehicle on this road. No soon had the thoughts left my head lightning struck, and a loud crack screamed across the Hills. Shrilly screaming, I covered my head with my hands and assumed the crash position.The back end of the truck flipped out, and Otis struggled to keep it on the road. The back hit something hard, sending a tearing noise through the inside, and the truck spun, hitting something else hard and was shoved backwards. Shit, we didn’t want to be going backwards down a ravine! Metal screamed as Otis still tried to stupidly control the truck, but it was far too late. The truck began gathering speed as we rolled backwards, and Otis cried out the brakes weren’t working. Give the genius a prize, everyone! Glass smashed, and I screamed as rain flew in the windows, soaking me on the floor.The truck hit something hard, so hard I felt the back crumple under the impact, but it didn’t stop there. The vehicle spun 180 degrees as the front tyres kept moving, and we began sliding forward before hitting something again hard. Finally, we stopped moving. Warily I glanced up, and although there were cuts to my hands and arms from protecting me, they’d heal. The truck gave an indignant hiss and settled. A thick branch had come through the front window, and as I pushed my shoulders back against my door, it opened a little and stuck.I could see Hans hanging in his seat, unconscious and blood dripping down his face. Otis, I couldn’t see because of the leafy branch covering his body. As I scrabbled to my knees, I cut them on a large piece of glass and swore. That had really hurt. Roughly pushing my bound hands in front of me, I began sawing back and forth to gain freedom. The ropes frayed, and I struggled for a few minutes before my hands were freed. Panicked, I kicked at the opposite door, and to my surprise, it gave way and opened. Trying not to cry as glass cut into my hands, I pulled myself forward and fell out into the rain and wind. The sky was so black it appeared night. No time to hesitate. I needed help and checked my pockets for my phone, only to remember Otis had taken it.Gingerly I pulled myself to my feet, and luckily it didn’t seem I’d broken any bones. I held onto the door as rain lashed me, and I wiped the water from my face. The wind blew the door shut, and I walked round to Otis’s side. My brother lay silent with his head outside the window, and I wondered if Otis was dead. No lie, I felt more than a little squeamish touching Otis, but I reached out and patted him down. I found my phone in his front pocket. The screen smashed and switched off, but I held out hope. Desperately, I brushed my hair out of my eyes and jumped again as lightning hit close by me.The weather had been very wrong. The weather channel mentioned a storm, but this raging nightmare was more than a storm. This was hell on earth. Otis’s eyes snapped open, and I cried out as he stared at me, dazed. Without a second thought, I took off, scrambling to escape. I’d had a few moments before searching Otis to get my bearings. The truck had been forced off the road and down a steep, jagged incline. The car had crashed to a halt against the trees, so the only way to go was up.In the pouring rain, without good visibility, I had to scramble up the slope. Loudly, I cursed the fact I’d sneakers on and a sweater, but no coat or boots. My jeans were soaked through already. Frantic to escape, I grabbed tree roots to haul myself up and finally reached the top. I took a couple of deep breaths and turned to jog down the road towards home when I froze in horror. Below me, the creek had flooded the road, and there was nothing to be seen. A fast-running, well, small river flowed across the road, and I shivered in the chilly air. There was only one way to go, and that was up. Two torch lights lit the darkness below me.Without hesitation, I set off at a steady pace. Otis and Hans wouldn’t catch me again, not without a seriously bitter fight. Yeah, I was wet, sore and miserable, but that was nothing compared to getting away from those two. I wasn’t sure whether to stay on the road or disappear into the forest. The choice was taken out of my hands when a torch swept close to me on the road, and I dived into the bushes to hide. They’d be running on an even flat surface, and I’d be slowed by trees, rocks and bushes, but at least I’d have cover.The rain hid much of the noise I made, and I was soaked through and thoroughly miserable. I ducked below tree branches swinging in the strong winds and kept heading upwards. I needed to find somewhere to shack up, a hut or cave perhaps. Just somewhere I could hole up, dry out, and rest. A twig snapped loudly near me, and I crouched amongst the mud and bushes, wondering if I’d been found. My eyes tiredly searched the darkness, but I couldn’t see a flash of light giving away a torch.Quietly, I moved forward, keeping low and trying to keep a lookout. Rock would come for me; someone would get word back to Rage that Otis and Hans had snatched me. Rock’s Charger was open and abandoned on the side of the road. Someone would find it. So the primary goal was to survive until this rain stopped and Rock found me. I ducked under a bush, wanting to check if my phone would work. Fingers metaphorically crossed and huddled in a ball to hide any sign of light, I pressed the on button and prayed. A few seconds later, my prayer was dashed when the screen stayed dark. The urge to rail against my circumstances nearly overwhelmed me, but I kept pushing onwards. Otis and Hans were out there somewhere.◆◆◆ “Did you get the alert?” Drake asked as he walked into Rage.“Yeah, the roads are flooding by the creek; mountain rescue is calling for help. People are trapped, and there’s been one mudslide, and they’re expecting more. Medics are setting up triage, but they’re swamped,” Ace replied as he pulled on wet gear. Drake looked around the clubhouse.“No one ride bikes; we go in four-wheel drives,” Drake said, checking who was present. The year they’d got Rage clean, they’d all signed on for mountain rescue, the start of Rage putting something back into their city. Rage usually did a week or two volunteering each year.“The entire area is a cesspit. Reports of roads running free with water, cars being stranded, and people trapped. The creek has burst its banks in four places, and it’s a total mess up there. Trees are down, and one team has been caught up and isolated. Too risky to fly a chopper in at this time,” Ace updated everyone.Present was the entire MC, all would be going out on the rescues bar Axel and Texas who were to stay at base camp and help organise teams to respond to calls. The prospects were tasked with being dogsbodies, fetching food, drink, medical kits, and driving vehicles to free up an EMT. They strode towards the cars and climbed in, heading for base camp at Deadman’s Gulch.Rock tried calling Carly to let her know what was happening, but Carly’s phone rang out. He imagined Carly was at home, tucked up safely, and that she hadn’t tried to reach the clubhouse.“Drake, are our homes safe?” Rock asked.“Yeah, our roads are clear, but there’s a lot in the Hills that aren’t,” Drake replied as he checked his rescue backpack, and his radio was working. Soon enough, they pulled up at Deadman Gulch and exited. People were hurrying, trying to get tents set up against the wind blowing them around the emergency camp. Drake motioned, and the prospects made their way over to help. He lifted a hand when three black SUVs arrived, and the men of Hawthorne Investigations arrived.“Who’s in charge?” Dylan Hawthorne asked.“Just arrived. I think the command tent is over there,” Drake said, pointing. Together they began walking in that direction as the storm blew around them. Inside the command tent, they discovered Chief Andre Howser of Rapid City police and the fire department Chief Bill Hawthorne, Dylan’s uncle.“What we got?” Drake asked as several other teams gathered around the table.“The road has washed out just above Elkhart Road, and we’ve people trapped there and including Blake Road. Johnson Siding Station two is covering the area around Cavern Road. The creek has washed out the road at the Naylor’s on the first tight bend on Dark Canyon Road. Anyone above that is trapped, and several have reported mudslides in the area too. Teams are going in six men to a team. No arguments, the situation is dangerous, and you’ll need the extra men,” Chief Hawthorne said.“Bill and I are staying here coordinating. You get diverted, you get trapped, see something hinky; we want to know. Do not risk yourselves in a stupid attempt at heroism, or you’ll never work search and rescue again. Each team is taking a dog handler with them, which makes you seven men. Bill has your teams and assignments,” Chief Howser said. Everyone moved around, looking for team leaders as Bill stood in front of a whiteboard with names written on it. The chief split them up, and Rock and Drake found themselves on the same team as Hawthorne, Officer Lucas and three fire and rescue. Together they formed Blue Team. Grimly they checked radios and headed out, as even more calls came from the families trapped in the Hills.◆◆◆ I no longer knew which way was up or down, left or right. And I’d lost sight of the road ages back when Otis had spotted me and given chase. In my haste to escape, I’d slipped and slid down a hill to get away and rolled into a ditch. I’d become so caked in mud that when Otis had literally stopped within an arm’s length, he’d not seen me.Tiredness had seeped into my bones, along with the bitter chill of the storm and the piercing wetness of the rain. The storm still raged, mother nature showing her power, and it had been roaring for hours. Wet through, I was shaking so badly I knew I’d catch a severe cold. The truth of the matter was, I was completely and utterly lost. My phone had an app that would have picked up my GPS and led me home, but it was useless. For now, I needed somewhere dry to hole up and safe to rest. Branches crunched from behind, and I wearily lifted my head and stared into the malevolent gaze of Hans. Surprised, I fell backwards as Hans lurched forward and sank a hand into my matted hair.And deep inside, my anger lit. I was finished with being pushed around by men who’d no respect for my wishes and desires or my right to live as I saw fit. I was finished being their wet blanket and punching bag. My hand scrabbled in the dirt, and I grabbed a handful of mud, and as Hans swung me around by my hair, I threw the mud in his face. Shakily, I leapt to my feet as Hans roared and clawed at the muck on his face. Clumsily, I fell against a tree after a few steps, and my hand caught on a heavy branch.“No!” I shouted in Han’s face, and as he reached for me, I swung the branch and knocked him straight on his back. Without hesitation, I swung the branch a second time and a third and fourth. Satisfied Hans wouldn’t be getting up soon, I began stumbling away, keeping an eye open for Otis. He couldn’t be far away if Hans was this close. I couldn’t imagine they’d split up.A low rumbling noise echoed off the surrounding inclines, and I glanced around warily. That hadn’t sounded too good. I was aware mudslides had happened in the Black Hills over the years. And I was fully aware that the Rapid Creek had flooded many years ago, and it had affected the Keystone area of Rapid City. There was a shout from behind, and I glanced back to see Otis scrambling towards me with a gun out. Otis fired one shot as a warning, and I dived to the slope and began scrambling up it.◆◆◆ “Reports of gunshots,” Red leader called over the radio, and Drake listened to the coordinates.“That’s near to us,” Hawthorne said, checking the GPS. They’d been in the Hills for several hours now and had performed several rescues.“This fucker needs to break,” Rock grumbled, eyeing the sky.“Not known a storm to last so long,” Drake agreed.“We’re going to head over that way; we’re better equipped. Red Team has two injuries they’re bringing in. May be someone calling for help or someone in trouble,” Officer Lucas said, and the others nodded.“You got the coordinates?” Drake asked, and Lucas nodded.“Yeah, I’ll take point,” Lucas said and checked everyone’s equipment over. They heard a loud rumble and swapped wary gazes.◆◆◆ The rumble came from above me, and I looked up and yelped as I saw the trees moving in the darkness. Trees didn’t move! Terrified and wondering what new horror I was witnessing. I saw the trees heading towards me and picking up speed. Shit, it wasn’t the trees moving; it was a mudslide and a large one at that. I frantically crawled sideways, no longer caring that Otis was behind me. The trees were coming towards me ever quicker, and the rumble was turning into a roar. Desperately wanting to cover my ears but aware of the danger heading towards me, I gave an almighty kick just as the edges of the mudslide clipped my legs.The force of the flowing mud knocked me aside and out of range and luckily not into it. Stretching, I reached for a tree branch and clung on tightly as mud flowed past me with trees, bushes, rocks, and other debris. There was only a foot between me and the flow. Although the sound was a roar, there was a dullness to it; it was a horrifying sound and one I knew would haunt me. Well, it would as long as I survived this, alive and intact.In survival mode, I drew my knee’s up and clung to the tree branch, and after several long minutes, the flood dropped to a slow trickle. Gasping for breath, I gazed around and couldn’t believe my eyes when I spied Otis clinging to a tree in the middle of the flood. His waist and hips were covered by the mud, and he looked to be hurt. Even then, Otis sneered, and to my disbelief, he drew a line of sight on me. I flipped him the finger and disappeared into the undergrowth. Fuck him and fuck helping him; Otis could go hang. ◆◆◆ “Man down,” Lucas called as they entered a small clearing. He withdrew his sidearm as he approached and forewarned Drake. Rock, and Hawthorne drew theirs.“What is it?” Drake asked, blinking rain out of his eyes.“Man’s been attacked, hit hard with the branch. Hey, you two, get over here,” Lucas called to the medics. They radioed in their position, and they watched as they rolled the man over and went to lay him on a backboard. Rock glimpsed something pink and leapt forward.“Wait,” he said and knelt in the mud and picked up a mud-covered phone. Rock’s guts twisted as he recognised the case, and he didn’t need to see the name on the back. Grimly Rock turned the phone and showed Drake the back. Drake’s jaw dropped open as Hawthorne leaned forward. Rock bent over the beaten man and began patting him down.“What the hell, Rock?” Officer Lucas demanded.“That’s Carly’s. The only reason Carly’s phone would be under that cunt, is if she was running. Carly’s out here somewhere, and I think she’s running from her brothers,” Rock growled, his gaze sweeping the forest. Shit, his girl was out here, maybe hurt, definitely scared, and Carly was running with no idea of where she was going. In the best conditions, the Black Hills were dangerous. Right now? They were lethal. The storm was abating, but it would remain hazardous for a while as the land settled.“Which way?” Rock asked, twisting his head.“Rock, we can’t leave him,” Officer Lucas said.“No, you can’t leave him; we can. That fucker had my girl. I’m looking for her. He can fuckin’ drown for all I care,” Rock said, and Lucas stared at him and decided.“You three go on ahead; I’m following these three down. If this man’s a criminal, I can’t leave them alone with him. Keep your radio on you and radio your position every five minutes, you agree, or you don’t go,” Lucas demanded, and they nodded.“Let’s go find Carly,” Rock said and began walking.◆◆◆ I crawled under an overhang that had fronds trailing, hiding it, and camouflaged my figure from anyone tracking. The truth was, I needed to start a fire, but everything was soaking wet, and plus, it would lead Otis to me. To keep warm, I huddled under the ledge and rubbed my hands up and down my legs. My fingers were turning blue, and I was sure my waterlogged boots were making my toes the same. But hey, I’d rather lose a finger or toe than lose my life. The storm was on its last legs, having finally blown itself out, and I shoved my mess of hair out of my eyes and tried to get my bearings.For a few moments, I allowed myself to imagine a roaring log fire, thick woollen blankets and thick, cosy socks. Then reality bit as Otis stumbled into view. He was shouting and cursing, and I realised Otis was trying to track my footprints. Damn it, I should have learned. Cautiously I slipped out from the ledge as Otis faced away from me and towards a cliff face.Without heed or caution, I raced away, knowing Otis still held that gun. It took Otis a few moments to discover my whereabouts, and when the weapon spat, I knew he was behind me. The fact he didn’t gain on me meant Otis was injured because I was not moving swiftly. Heart in my throat, I ran as best as I could through the foliage, scratching my legs and arms and not caring. Better them than the consequences should Otis catch me. I tripped over a tree root that the recent rain had uncovered and tumbled down a steep incline. Landing at the bottom winded me, and I banged my head hard. I wasn’t sure if I had the strength to continue. The cold was too insidious, and bone-weary tiredness claimed me. My will, focus, and strength drained from me, and I lay there, dazed and lost.Minutes ticked by, hell hours may have ticked by, I’ve no idea, but a hand sank into my hair and began dragging me away from where I lay. It was Otis, but I didn’t have it to fight anymore. Due to the slickness of the mud, I was dragged easily backwards as Otis spat and swore at me. Otis was threatening nasty things, and I let it go over my head. Too tired, I couldn’t fight Otis now. I was frozen to the bone and worn out. But when I grew warmer and regained my strength, he’d be a eunuch before the night ended.Otis scrambled heedlessly in the mud, forcing rocks loose and tiny plants to come free. I tried to warn him to be careful, but as usual, my idiot brother didn’t use the brains that God gave him. A small rock hit me on the head, and I swallowed mud before gagging and spitting it out. I heard a slight rustle and knew Otis was disturbing the loose ground.“Are you so determined to kill us both?” I cried, and Otis howled.“You, yes. God damn you, Carly. All you had to do was spread ya legs and let Hans fuck you. Why was that so fuckin’ hard for ya? Oh, miss, high and mighty, always wanting better than where she came from. Just one fuck Carly,” Otis hollered.“This is my body. What right do you have to sell it?” I yelled as best I could.“Every right, we fed and clothed you,” Otis spat.“And Mom and Dad fed and clothed you, so should they have sold your virgin ass to a pervert?” I yelled.“I’m a man, worth more than a cunt,” Otis screamed. My hand grasped a rock, and I swung it upwards at him, smashing him in the kneecap. Otis fell on top of me, crying.“If I’m going to die, so are you!” I shrieked and hit Otis with the rock again, smashing his thigh. I kicked against his body and raked his face, and scrambled backwards.“You fuckin’ cunt!” Otis roared, trying to get to his feet.“Asshole, I hate you; I hate you!” I screamed and threw the rock. Wherever this surge of energy came from, I thanked it as I pulled myself up the steep slope.“Carly!” Rock bellowed, and I froze in shock, looking around for him.“Rock!” I screamed back, trying to see him. The rain had stopped, but night was approaching fast. I saw a flash of yellow from the peak above me, and I squinted. There, there were three beautiful figures in bright yellow.“Carly, get out of there. The grounds not stable,” Rock yelled.“No shit, Sherlock,” I muttered as I moved sideways.“Carly, we’re rappelling down. Get to a safe spot,” Drake called.“There isn’t one,” I called back. The third man shone a torch, seeking somewhere for me to climb to.“Carly, that big oak tree there, move towards that. The roots will be too deep in the ground to be pulled free, and it’s at the edge of the slide,” Dylan Hawthorne called.“Okay,” I said and turned ninety degrees to crawl towards the oak tree. The men above me kept doing what they were doing when Otis fired his gun at me. I yelped and dropped flat, face first in the mud, and my body went stiff, expecting pain. When no pain was forthcoming, I lifted my head and gazed at Otis with hate. A loud sound boomed off the hills, and I stared in horror as Rock, Drake, and Hawthorne dived to one side. To the left of the peak, they’d been standing on, came yet another mudslide, screaming and roaring as it drove towards me.This slide had me dead to right in its sights, and I struggled to reach the oak tree. Otis seeing my direction, moved that way too, but I beat him to it and tried to climb up its branches. The bark was too slippery, and I couldn’t catch hold. Rock’s horrified scream echoed in my ears, and the deluge swept me away. Otis gave a hoarse shout as he was smothered.I’d never felt so helpless as I struggled against the flood and tried to find a grab hold somewhere. My body was battered as I rolled and flipped in the fast-moving water and mud. I clawed for purchase while trying to keep my head above ground. With a jarring body slam, I crashed into something hard and spun in a different direction. The image of Rock roaring in horror was seared into my mind as I banged into heavy debris multiple times. Finally, my battered body fetched up against something.On instinct, I scrabbled for a hold and got my fingertips into a small crevasse. On instinct, I hauled myself closer, my heart pounding as the roaring of the flood surrounded me. My knees smashed into the tree, and I cried out and swallowed mud. Furiously, I spat it out and hooked an arm over the lower branch of the tree. Shit, it didn’t seem as sturdy as the oak I’d initially aimed at. No time for doubt, however, as the water swirled around me. I drew in a breath and, with a surge of energy, hauled myself further up the tree, but my waist and bottom half were trapped in the mud.But it didn’t matter how hard I tried to kick my legs free or pull myself clear of the sucking mud; I was truly trapped. Pins and needles shot down my bruised and cut legs, and I gave up fighting and chose to trust in God. Horrible smells from the debris milled around, making me want to gag. Fearfully, I understood that if I released this final lifeline, I’d be dead. There was no coming back from the deluge. The force would sweep me downstream, and I’d drown. A yell came from close by, and I gazed in horrified amusement as Otis was swept near me.His hand reached out, and I stared into his eyes. There was no inner voice, no little angel or devil on my shoulder. I held his gaze and denied him the lifeline Otis sought. Together we both understood that I only needed to reach out a hand and haul Otis to safety. Not today, not ever. Otis was a massive piece of shit, and I wouldn’t mourn him. Holding his scared eyes, I clung tighter to my tree and watched him as Otis was swallowed up, screaming.“See ya, asshole, may the devil take your soul,” I gasped. I don’t know how long I clung to that tree. My arms cramped, and the pain was a welcome relief from the cold and fear. Life would be far easier if I just let go. Because everything bad would float away and disappear in a few short minutes. I was facing a world of pain recovering, and it was tempting to let go.“Carly, hang in there!” Rock ordered, and even in my dazed state, I jumped. His voice echoed around the canyon, and I dully realised he’d used a bullhorn. It was the only way I could have heard him. The roaring water was too loud. Interested, I idly wondered how he’d save me from this mess. Fight rose in me, the will to fight for our life together, for our future children, for the promises we’d made each other. Fuck no, I wasn’t letting those go when they were within my grasp.Minutes ticked by, punctuated by the three men taking turns to call out encouragement to me as I clung to my little tree. Idly, I wondered how they’d reach me; the fast-moving water had slowed, but it was so very unsafe still. It was impossible to turn my head and see what they were doing and to be honest, it would take energy away from clinging to my position.Finally, I heard splashing sounds and frowned. What could be splashing near me? A yellow boat appeared in the corner of my eye, and I twisted my head a tiny little bit, and my eyes widened as Drake appeared in a yellow dinghy. It was attached to several ropes stopping it from sweeping past me as Drake battled to reach me. The mudflow had stopped, but now water flooded the surrounding area. The look of sheer determination to reach me on Drake’s face made me gasp. With a mighty heave, Drake paddled the dinghy, and it bumped against my tree.“Hold me in place,” Drake roared and turned to me. Drake fitted a safety harness to himself and attached it to the boat, and leant towards me.“Drake,” I stuttered.“Hold on, baby, you got to listen to me. I’m gonna bring this in closer, once I do, you keep holding on tightly until I get a harness around you. As soon as the harness is safe, I’ll tell you to let go. I know it’s going to be hard to trust me, but Carly, as soon as you let go, I’ll have you here safe,” Drake said. I listened intently and nodded.“Easy to trust you,” I said, and I saw my words touched Drake. He gave me one of his trademark chin lifts and moved the dinghy closer. I watched as Drake checked he was secure, and then he leant over the edge and fitted a harness around my waist. Drake couldn’t get it over my shoulders but secured it as best as he could.“Carly, let go and fall into my arms,” Drake ordered, and I didn’t hesitate before letting go. Strong arms caught and hauled me towards the dinghy. There was a moment of hard pulling, and Drake heaved me into the boat, and I collapsed on the floor. Drake yanked a thermal silver blanket out of a packet and tucked it in around me. As I lay there helplessly, Drake checked my vitals and dropped a kiss on my mucky head.“Carly’s safe; pull us back,” Drake roared and tucked me into his body as he used a paddle to guide debris away from him. Rock and Dylan pulled the dinghy to them, fighting against the current, but finally, they pulled it up safely to where they were.“Carly’s going to need carrying out. I couldn’t discern any life concerning injuries, but she’s hypothermic and has many cuts and bruises. Carly’s got a couple of head wounds, and I’m worried about her fingers and toes,” Drake summed up as Rock checked me over briskly. I was happily wavering between blackness and warmth.“Rock, get the backboard; don’t know if there’re any injuries to her spine. I’ve radioed in that we’ve a victim coming in, and EMTs are on standby for when we get out of here,” Dylan said. My gaze swapped between the three men barking orders. Rock’s large hand lightly touched my forehead and then cupped my face, and I gave up and closed my eyes and let the darkness swallow me.",

      "content": "Chapter Eight.I was definitely unamused at the sound of voices angrily discussing my condition over my pounding head. Clearly, Rock, Drake, Doc Paul and Doc Gibbons were loudly disagreeing with something that concerned me, judging by the number of times my name was being used.“Shut up, please!” I groaned as the two little dwarves inside my skull struck hammer blows that would kill a lesser being.“Carly!” Rock exclaimed, and his hands cupped my face and jerked it gently. My stomach rebelled, and I just rolled to the side of the bed in time, where I heaved. There is nothing worse than vomiting on an empty stomach.“Shit,” Rock muttered, less sure of himself. Shit, indeed. My body stopped heaving, and I rolled back and glared balefully at the four men.“My head hurts,” I croaked. Doc Gibbons stepped forward.“Hello, young lady, by your hand is a button. Push it when you need pain relief.” Doc Gibbons kindly instructed.“Okay,” I whispered, pressing the button. Moments later, my headache eased, and I gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, thank God.”“How are you feeling?” Doc Paul asked, approaching the bed.“Like I got hit with a mudslide?” I quipped and was met with two dark scowls. “Too early to be joking?”“Definitely. My fuckin’ heart stopped when I saw you clinging to that tree,” Rock said, and I sensed the restraint he was employing at staying calm.“How severe are my injuries?” I asked.“Nothing is broken, so that makes a pleasant change, but you are black and blue from head to toe. You’ve had several large cuts stitched and you’ve got a sprained wrist. We’ve put you on strong antibiotics because of the mud you swallowed, or you may have possibly infected cuts. To be honest, Carly, you look and probably feel a mess,” Doc Gibbons said, and I winced.“Yeah, I do feel pretty banged up. Every muscle hurts to move,” I admitted. Rock placed a hand over mine and pressed the button. Unamused, I wanted to scold him but knew Rock only did it out of concern. For Rock, it must have been completely horrifying seeing me clinging to the little tree. I don’t know which was worse, living or watching it. Rock’s haunted face crossed my mind, and I winced. I never wanted to see that look on him again. The expression had been terrible to behold. The anguish on Rock’s face, the knowledge he couldn’t reach me and was failing me. Of course, to me, Rock hadn’t failed. It had been an incredible miracle that he’d found me.“How, how did you find me?” I whispered. Rock held my head up and held a glass to my lips, and I sipped.“Gunshots were reported by another team. We were closest to investigate, although we hadn’t heard them over the roaring of the creek,” Drake explained. Poor Drake, he looked worn out.“Team?” I asked, trying to play catch up.“The mountain rescue teams Carly, you know Rage are a part of them,” Rock said, and I remembered. Mountain Rescue was something Drake strongly believed in, and according to Silvie, Rage joined the moment they were clean. A way of paying back to the community that they’d disrespected one way or another when under Bulldog’s control.“Yeah, I ‘member,” I mumbled as my eyes drifted closed.“The others are still out there pulling people to safety,” Drake explained, and I tried to nod, but my eyes drooped. Sleep settled over me; I was safe in the knowledge Rock was here, and everything was perfect.◆◆◆ “No one from Rage was injured?” I asked Silvie, who was sitting at my bedside. Twenty-four hours had passed after the great rescue, and I was far more awake than I had been.“No, a cop and firefighter were hurt, and two tracking dogs saved their teams when they sensed danger. One dog was injured, hauling his team to safety before they realised what he was barking at. A freaking bear had been disturbed by the floods and was confused and angry. The dog managed to save the entire team, which makes him a hero,” Silvie said, smiling.“Oh bless,” I said and shifted. My right side felt as if someone had taken a giant cheese grater to me and rubbed me raw.“But our guys are still out there; many stranded people need help. The creek completely overflowed and has caused a lot of damage. The flood’s been labelled a disaster, and the governor’s called for help. Phoe’s flown in supplies, and the hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with injuries, minor and large.”“And deaths?” I asked quietly.“Twenty-seven so far, two children,” Silvie said sadly. “The Chief says the count will climb higher. They are expecting three figures.” In horror, I gasped and shook my head.“No!” I denied.“Yes, reports say six inches of rain fell from the skies, adding to the heavy rainfall this past week. All in all, reports are saying that over the last week over ten inches of rain has fallen. It just collapsed the flood defences, overran the dam, which was already high and… jeez, Carly. Dozens of homes are gone, and the missing is in triple figures,” Silvie said with tears welling in her eyes.“Where are the old ladies?” I asked.“At the front line, helping wherever they can. Serving food, drinks, handing out blankets and so on. All the children are at Reading Hall, Phoe called in her security team, and the older kids are looking after the younger ones. Micah and Jodie wanted to help, but Phoe begged them to watch the kids, so they freed up the old ladies. Willow, Rosie, and Serenity are helping at the Hall.”“Silvie, I’m surprised they made it to the Hall,” I said. I thought that Nemo Road, off of South Canyon Road, would have flooded too.“No, South Canyon Road is fine; there’re trees down and a few boulders in the roads, but the elder kids got the smaller ones to the Hall just fine. The roads where the creek has burst are badly affected. Flood defences have failed everywhere. No that’s wrong, flood defences held for the most part, but the creek overflowed in other places. Shit’s a mess out there.”“Silvie, the teams? How long are they out there?” Silvie’s face scrunched. Shit, I didn’t like that look.“The teams were pulling twelve hours shifts searching,” Silvie said slowly.“Spit it out,” I demanded.“Rage, Hawthorne’s and the RCPD refused to come in and camped out in the Hills. They were at breaking point when Chief Hawthorne forced them to return. Idiots were out for thirty-six hours,” Silvie said and made a moue with her mouth. Crap, I agreed. Those teams would push themselves, thinking they had stuff to prove.“What’s the damage at, monetary wise?” I asked. Silvie winced.“At the moment, they’re saying twenty million, they’re expecting it to double the next twenty-four hours and possibly even triple. The flood carried into town, including the areas around Canyon Lake Park. It stopped just past Founders Park, and it’s gone as wide as Cedar Ridge townhouses, and there’s damage as far as the Arrowhead Estates. The creek burst its bank in multiple places.The flood alert system got the warning out, they evacuated many people, but some refused to leave their homes. Rescuers are fighting on multiple fronts, flood control, debris, homeless, shoring up the remaining flood defences. The National Guard has arrived, and more are incoming. Red Cross is actively setting up refuge areas, and help is coming from local states. The area flooded is huge; rescue workers are working themselves to the bone,” Silvie sighed. And I guessed Silvie meant those closest to us as well. That made sense. Rage had a dedicated sense of community, and so did their old ladies.“Hellfire?” I croaked, knowing that Rage’s brother club wouldn’t be far behind them.“They’re here and on teams,” Silvie replied.“Who’s with Harley?” I asked.“Carly, we’ve been struggling; I’m going across to him in a moment,” Silvie said.“Can I share Harley’s room?” I asked, and Silvie shrugged. “Look, I’m not going anywhere you said for a couple of days. So I can share with Harley, and then we can free up the person due to sit with him. Even when discharged, I can still sit with Harley, as I won’t be good for anything else,” I argued.“That makes sense and would ease the worry off everyone,” Silvie said. “Let me grab a nurse.” Two hours later, I was parked in a bed in Harley’s private room, and my belongings had followed. Worried, I told Silvie to go and picked up the latest book that was being read to Harley. I sniggered as I saw it was Frankenstein. Opening the cover, I began reading it to the boy that had two MCs dancing around him.◆◆◆ It was dark when I smelt something nasty, and I opened my eyes and spied Rock standing beside my bed. Dear God, he smelt awful and looked shattered, but his gaze was firmly focused on me.“How are you doing?” I asked, hauling myself up in bed and wincing as I did so. My head was fuzzy, but I knew Rock needed me right then.“Shit, baby,” Rock said and stepped backwards, “smell like shit too.” Well, I couldn’t deny that.“This room has our own private shower; do you have a change of clothes?” I asked, and Rock nodded and pointed to a bag.“Yeah, I got eight hours downtime, Chief insisted.”“Shower and come to bed,” I whispered, glancing at Harley, who hadn’t stirred. Rock hesitated, and I saw sorrow in his eyes.“What happened?” I whispered. Rock swallowed hard, and panic rose.“Dragged three babies out of a flooded house; we were minutes too late for their parents,” Rock said hoarsely, and I saw the abject misery in his eyes. Sadly, I automatically reached out to him. Rock hesitated, no doubt aware of his foul odour, but I leaned forward to grab him. Rock came willingly into my arms. Hoarse sobs broke from Rock, and I hugged him tightly. I ran a hand through Rock’s hair and down his back and back up again while holding him tightly against my badly bruised ribs.Yeah, it freaking hurt. But who cared when Rock was in so much pain? And worse of the worse, hauling dead parents from a house. Rock sobbed, but it was so heartbroken I wondered if he’d be haunted by the failure to rescue the parents in time. There was so many needing help and so few to help. The teams couldn’t be everywhere, and Rock had to understand that. But my heart hurt because Rock hurt.And it proved how much Rock needed, loved, and trusted me. This man had been an oak tree alone for years, silent, stern, gruff, arrogant, but he felt so profoundly. Rock projected a wall that was so high not even a high jumper could breach it. He was aptly named Rock, strong and durable but will crack under the right pressure. And the pressure of this dreadful storm and flooding, the mudslides and flooded homes, damaged property and innocent lives lost was the crack that opened into a crevasse.Calmly, I rocked him back and forth in my arms as Rock clung to me like I was his lifeline. Rock buried his head in my neck, and I held him there, allowing his hot tears to scald me. The door opened, and Drake entered, appearing as every bit as broken as Rock. Drake collapsed in the chair next to Harley and stared at his son. Every ounce of pain was clearly etched into Drake’s face as he contemplated Harley. Rock’s tears slowed, and he wiped his eyes and lifted his head.“Go shower,” I whispered, and Rock nodded without even glancing at Drake. Rock bent and grabbed his bag and disappeared. “Drake, come here,” I ordered, but I don’t think he heard me. I repeated my words and saw the same misery in Drake’s eyes as he finally glanced at me.“Don’t make me get out of bed Drake, I don’t think I can, but I will certainly try,” I threatened. Drake rose to his feet and trudged over to me. Shit, Drake smelt even worse than Rock, but I sucked it up as Drake sat on my bed and silent tears ran down his face. I folded Drake into my arms and offered comfort as the huge, strong, amazing president of Rage cried like a baby. Rock was aware of what was happening because he stayed in that tiny bathroom.Drake clung to me, holding me tightly and possibly adding more accidental bruises. But that was okay because Drake needed someone to hold him, not to speak or offer false comfort. Just to let Drake deal with his emotions and pain and be his sponge. Soak it up so Drake could go back out in eight hours and repeat his actions of today. I’d mention therapy to Phoe when we next spoke.“The youngest was two Carly, fuckin’ two, clinging to her mother. If we’d got there half an hour earlier, the parents would be alive,” Drake said on a choking sob.“And how could you have got there earlier? What were you doing beforehand?” I whispered into Drake’s ear.“Was hauling a woman and two children out of a car that was swept away; they’d been there two days barely hanging on,” Drake muttered.“So you’d have left that family to die?” I asked, knowing there was no way Drake would have considered leaving them. Drake shook his head. “Sometimes Drake, there is no right or wrong, no easy way, choose one route and innocents die, choose another, the same happens. That woman and her children are alive because you and Rock got to her. Those parents, it’s an awful tragedy but not yours to carry. It’s Gods; it was his will you saved that woman and her children. His will that he called the parents to him. God knows you’re strong enough, Drake, to handle this, or he wouldn’t have dealt you this hand,” I said.“Didn’t think you were religious,” Drake muttered, wiping his eyes.“Sometimes I go to church, and I believe in God. And Drake, if Rage couldn’t reach those parents, no one could have. Shit’s as simple as that,” I whispered, stroking the harsh planes of his face and soothing worry lines.“Gonna haunt me, babe; the kids were clinging to their parents crying,” Drake said.“Yeah, but you’re a good man, Drake, and you’ll make peace with this. It will just take time,” I whispered, and he nodded.“Thanks, babe, I couldn’t take this home to Phoe,” Drake said and wiped the last tear from his face. Rock exited the bathroom, and Drake, studiously keeping his face averted, stumbled to the bathroom and disappeared. Rock didn’t say a word but dropped his bag and climbed into bed with me. He wrapped himself around me and fell straight to sleep. By the time Drake finished, Rock’s gentle snores were echoing off the walls. I told Drake to take the daybed and laid down holding Rock tightly.When I woke the following day, Rock and Drake were gone. But I felt more able to move my body and got out of bed and showered, and climbed into a chair. Those minor tasks sucked my energy away, and I picked up Harley’s book and began reading to him while holding his hand. I was so tired and engrossed in the story, I almost missed it. A faint twitch in my hand. Surprised, I held my breath as I looked up and focused on Harley. His face was impassive, peaceful, and his eyes were shut. A slight frown crossed my brow, and I bent my head and began reading again, and the twitch happened a second time, stronger now.“Harley?” I whispered, gazing at the boy. His eyelids flickered, and his eyes moved behind his lids. “Oh my God, Harley, open your eyes if you can hear me!” Minutes ticked by, the clock loudly announcing each passing second. Then a third twitch and Harley’s hand squeezed mine tightly.“Oh my God, Harley!” I cried. “Open your eyes, beautiful boy!” I demanded, and his eyelids fluttered as he struggled to obey. And then suddenly, I was staring into his confused, soft brown eyes. Harley moved his head as if searching his surroundings, and a lock of ash blond hair fell over his face. I swept it away and pressed the button for the on-call nurse.“Harley, stay with me, stay with me. It’s Carly. Do you remember me?” I babbled frantically. Harley’s mouth moved, and in a croak, said one word.“C… C… C… Carly.”“Yes, it’s me, it’s me. Harley stay awake honey, where is that damned nurse?” I gasped, pressing the button frantically. A nurse strode in, disapproval on her face as she opened her mouth to berate me for being impatient.“Harley’s awake!” I yelled, and she turned a surprised gaze on the boy staring at her.“I’ll call the doctors,” she said and hurried out the door. Overwhelmed, I fumbled for the replacement phone Silvie had brought me and finally managed, with shaking hands, to hit the call button.“Phoe!” I shrieked, deafening her. “Harley’s awake. He’s awake!” I yelled and burst into emotional tears.◆◆◆ The room had been chaos ever since I hit the nurse button. Doc Paul arrived within minutes, swiftly followed by Harley’s neurosurgeon and several other specialists. Harley remained confused, his hand clinging tightly to mine as he was poked and prodded and questioned. I knew it would take time for Phoe or Drake to arrive, and I was closest and assumed the role of Harley’s protector. Obviously, he’d no idea what was happening, and their questions made Harley even more confused.“Enough!” I finally snapped at everyone. “Harley hasn’t a clue what’s going on, and you’re overwhelming him. Leave until his parents get here so they can explain.” Doc Paul agreed and ushered everyone out, despite several doctors trying to overrule him.“Carly,” Harley stuttered.“It’s okay, honey. I know things are confusing. But you’re in the hospital, and Phoe and Drake are on their way,” I whispered, smoothing his hair away from his eyes.“What happened?” Harley asked hoarsely.“You had an accident, but everything’s going to be fine. We’ll move heaven and earth to make it right, Harley. I know you have questions, but let’s wait for them, okay? Fuck, I’m so relieved to see you awake,” I said.“How long?” Harley muttered, and I realised he wanted to know how long he’d been asleep. How do you tell a teenager he’d been unresponsive in a coma for over a year? Unfortunately, I didn’t have the conversation skills to drop that bombshell on him.“Just wait for your mom and dad, ay Harley?” I said. The door flew open, and Rock took up the space, his eyes focused on Harley. Rock’s face was pale, and his eyes searched the boy from head to toe before drifting back to his face.“Fuck me, son, you don’t realise how much we needed a miracle today,” Rock rumbled and strode forward to gather Harley gently in his arms. Tears pricked my eyes as Harley tried to lift his arms to hold Rock, but he lacked the strength to cling to him. Rock didn’t give a shit and held the boy as, for the second time in a day, I watched tears leak from his eyes. He dashed them away and gently settled Harley back on the bed. Rock’s hands fluttered over Harley, unsure what to do, and settled on holding Harley’s hand.“How you feeling, kid?” Rock asked.“Confused,” Harley stuttered. His eyes kept flicking towards the door.“Phoe and Drake will be here soon. I was closest to the hospital, as I was on my way back with a… friend.” Rock changed the last word. A victim is what Rock had planned to say before he choked the word off. Harley caught the slip, and a frown crossed his forehead. Despite Harley’s confusion from his coma, his mental capacities functioned just fine.“Trouble?” Harley stammered, and Rock gave a sharp nod.“A storm, bad one, Harley, but you don’t need to worry,” Rock reassured him.“Injured,” Harley asked, nodding at me.“Yeah, I had an accident, Harley, so have to stay awhile. I thought we’d be roomies,” I said and nearly leapt out of my skin. The door slammed open, and Phoe rushed through, her eyes wild and hair crazy mad where she’d been tugging at it. Her hand flew to her mouth as she spied Harley awake and staring at her.A wounded cry left her mouth, and she flew forward, shoving Rock out of the way and gathered her son. Rock grunted and stood behind her as broken sobs left Phoe’s mouth as Harley stared at us with confused eyes. Phoe’s hands touched his hair and back frantically, assuring herself Harley was awake, and her tears soaked his gown.“My boy,” Phoe sobbed, clinging tightly.“Phoe, Harley doesn’t know what’s happened,” I murmured in her ear. Phoe gave a nod to inform me she’d heard and took a couple of deep breaths. The door slammed open a third time, and Drake stood there, face haggard but full of hope. It took Drake seconds to cross the room and scoop his son and wife in his arms. For the second time in twenty-four hours, I witnessed Drake cry.I motioned to Rock to get me out of there. Drake and Phoe needed privacy, and I felt like a voyeur. Rock stepped outside and returned with a wheelchair, and I slipped into it, and Rock wheeled me from the room. As I left, I heard Drake’s deep voice rumbling reassurances to his family.◆◆◆ “How is it out there today?” I asked. Three days had passed since the storm, and I imagined it was more recovery than a rescue effort. Rock’s face was tight, the years piled on him, and he was bone tired.“Bad, we’ve still got rescues high in the Hills and roads are cut off. There’re survivors, and we’re pulling them in still, but the body count is rising. Last figure was near two hundred.” Rock stated baldly. I winced and lifted a hand to take hold of his.“When the crisis has ended, we’re going on vacation. We’re finding somewhere away from this with a cosy cabin and lots of sex,” I said, and Rock bit out a laugh.“That what you want, baby?” Rock asked.“Yeah, nothing fancy. Somewhere we can be alone and recover from these last few days,” I said.“We can do that,” Rock said and pushed me outside into the small garden the hospital kept for patients. Rock pushed me away from other patients and sat on the grass next to my chair.“Can I do anything?” I asked, reaching over for his shoulder.“Nah, baby, we know death comes with this job; it’s the… innocents we find hard,” Rock said, staring out at nothing. Swap innocents for children, I thought.“Miracles happen, Rock,” I whispered. Rock nodded, lost in thought, and I struggled out of the wheelchair and climbed into his lap. He wrapped arms around me and rested his chin on the top of my head. And we sat like that for several hours.◆◆◆ A week later, Rage was released from their rescue duties. Things resumed as normal on the forecourt and local businesses, except for their demeanours. Those who’d taken part, which was most of them, had a saddened, deadened look to them. The old ladies worried about how to manage this depression that had sunk over Rage. Phoe and Drake dealt with Harley and his recovery, thankful their boy was awake. Artemis spent so much time dragging Ace off for sex it was a wonder the man could walk. The upshot, however, was Ace improved because he was too damn tired to dwell on things.Marsha simply kidnapped Fish with the help of Texas and Axel and bundled him and their twins off on a long holiday. It was amusing watching Fish be hogtied and carried to their SUV. Silvie distracted Apache in much the same way as Artemis and Ace. Sin had taken Jett on vacation, and so had Lindsey with Lowrider. Ellen bundled Axel up in their cottage for two weeks, and Willow ended up bunking in a hotel.Penny had refused to bake anything for Texas unless he took her on a cruise, and Texas held out for twelve hours before Penny and the kids were whisked off. Gunner, Autumn and their brood toured Europe for a month. Sin dragged Jett off on a rare book buying tour for three weeks, leaving her beloved Reading Nook in her brother’s Reid’s hands. The other brothers found themselves packed off to various vacation homes that Phoe owned.I didn’t have any trouble; the moment I was released from the hospital, I scoured the web looking for a holiday I thought would suit us both. I ended up booking a three-week vacation to a ski resort in Austria. Rock seemed the type to enjoy winter sports, and I’d been right. He desperately needed the break Austria gave him. The lines faded from his face, and slowly his body relaxed as he began having fun.Until we left on vacation, Rock and I spent time with the three orphans that Rock and Drake had rescued. The State was trying to hunt a relative, but the two they’d discovered so far had been highly unsuitable. We spent hours with the two boys aged six and five and the little girl aged two. Rock worried about what would happen to them, and I fell in love with them, too. During the vacation, we face-timed them every day.The flood of Rapid City had caused millions in damage, and the cost of life had been high. Over three hundred dead, a campsite had lost fifty people alone when a flash flood had taken them unawares. But amid the tragedy, miracles occurred. Harley awoke, bringing much-needed relief to his immediate family and extended one. Phoe informed me how Chance, too, had cried when he saw his nephew awake and alert. Lex’s guilt finally disappeared. Not that Lex had anything to feel guilty about. He hadn’t been able to reach Harley in time to stop the bat from connecting with his head, but that wasn’t down to Lex.Rescuers from RCFD discovered a baby girl alive in a flooded house. Her mother barely breathing beside her, but they were alive. Two women had been rescued from a high tree they’d climbed, securing themselves with belts and ropes. Both women were severely dehydrated after five days of rationing the one water bottle they’d grabbed. A boat was discovered drifting aimlessly, and inside were five children from a different campsite whose boat had been thought lost in another flash flood. Their parents had survived and not given up hope. A car was unearthed several inches under a mudslide, and the family inside were alive.Despite the horrors the rescuers had seen, they’d also seen miracles too. Rapid City came together without anyone asking. Businesses that had survived when their rivals hadn’t, helped them begin to get back to a resemblance of normalcy. The entire HQ turned out, knocking door to door, for donations for homeless people. Phoe donated several million to a fund to get urgent supplies to the displaced survivors and paid for an entire hotel to be rented for six months for them.Ellen organised her school children into a food drive and then had them box up food parcels to be delivered. Sin and Reid spent a fortune sending out healthy lunches for two weeks for the rescuers who still searched. Shops donated items, and across the state of South Dakota, charity poured in. Little old ladies sat knitting blankets for children. The quilting clubs churned out duvets and other items. BlackRock Construction sent teams to shore up houses that could be saved until the owner’s insurance got on the job.Rapid City mourned and buried its dead and held memorials for the missing. It celebrated those who’d been saved and those who spent countless hours seeking anything with a sign of life. The local zoo and vets had rescued numerous animals, and donations had flooded in for them, too. The city came together in a way that meant the world to everyone involved. And I was proud to be part of that city, that wonderful caring city where we didn’t turn our backs on people in a time of crisis. And I was incredibly proud to call myself Rock’s old lady because, despite his rough and tumble ways, he was someone to be proud of. Something his stinking rich and arrogant family had no idea about.Meanwhile, Rock and I visited the three children and made sure they were safe and looked after. The children clung to us as some form of normalcy, while State looked for a decent relative to house them. I hated the thought of those babies ending up in foster care, and Rock did too. In fact, I hated it so much, I began asking myself silent questions that only I held the answer to.",

Clearly, Rock, Drake, Doc Paul and Doc Gibbons were loudly disagreeing with something that concerned me, judging by the number of times my name was being used.“Shut up, please!” I groaned as the two little dwarves inside my skull struck hammer blows that would kill a lesser being.“Carly!” Rock exclaimed, and his hands cupped my face and jerked it gently. My stomach rebelled, and I just rolled to the side of the bed in time, where I heaved. There is nothing worse than vomiting on an empty stomach.“Shit,” Rock muttered, less sure of himself. Shit, indeed. My body stopped heaving, and I rolled back and glared balefully at the four men.“My head hurts,” I croaked. Doc Gibbons stepped forward.“Hello, young lady, by your hand is a button. Push it when you need pain relief.” Doc Gibbons kindly instructed.“Okay,” I whispered, pressing the button. Moments later, my headache eased, and I gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, thank God.”“How are you feeling?” Doc Paul asked, approaching the bed.“Like I got hit with a mudslide?” I quipped and was met with two dark scowls. “Too early to be joking?”“Definitely. My fuckin’ heart stopped when I saw you clinging to that tree,” Rock said, and I sensed the restraint he was employing at staying calm.“How severe are my injuries?” I asked.“Nothing is broken, so that makes a pleasant change, but you are black and blue from head to toe. You’ve had several large cuts stitched and you’ve got a sprained wrist. We’ve put you on strong antibiotics because of the mud you swallowed, or you may have possibly infected cuts. To be honest, Carly, you look and probably feel a mess,” Doc Gibbons said, and I winced.“Yeah, I do feel pretty banged up. Every muscle hurts to move,” I admitted. Rock placed a hand over mine and pressed the button. Unamused, I wanted to scold him but knew Rock only did it out of concern. For Rock, it must have been completely horrifying seeing me clinging to the little tree. I don’t know which was worse, living or watching it. Rock’s haunted face crossed my mind, and I winced. I never wanted to see that look on him again. The expression had been terrible to behold. The anguish on Rock’s face, the knowledge he couldn’t reach me and was failing me. Of course, to me, Rock hadn’t failed. It had been an incredible miracle that he’d found me.“How, how did you find me?” I whispered. Rock held my head up and held a glass to my lips, and I sipped.“Gunshots were reported by another team. We were closest to investigate, although we hadn’t heard them over the roaring of the creek,” Drake explained. Poor Drake, he looked worn out.“Team?” I asked, trying to play catch up.“The mountain rescue teams Carly, you know Rage are a part of them,” Rock said, and I remembered. Mountain Rescue was something Drake strongly believed in, and according to Silvie, Rage joined the moment they were clean. A way of paying back to the community that they’d disrespected one way or another when under Bulldog’s control.“Yeah, I ‘member,” I mumbled as my eyes drifted closed.“The others are still out there pulling people to safety,” Drake explained, and I tried to nod, but my eyes drooped. Sleep settled over me; I was safe in the knowledge Rock was here, and everything was perfect.◆◆◆ “No one from Rage was injured?” I asked Silvie, who was sitting at my bedside. Twenty-four hours had passed after the great rescue, and I was far more awake than I had been.“No, a cop and firefighter were hurt, and two tracking dogs saved their teams when they sensed danger. One dog was injured, hauling his team to safety before they realised what he was barking at. A freaking bear had been disturbed by the floods and was confused and angry. The dog managed to save the entire team, which makes him a hero,” Silvie said, smiling.“Oh bless,” I said and shifted. My right side felt as if someone had taken a giant cheese grater to me and rubbed me raw.“But our guys are still out there; many stranded people need help. The creek completely overflowed and has caused a lot of damage. The flood’s been labelled a disaster, and the governor’s called for help. Phoe’s flown in supplies, and the hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with injuries, minor and large.”“And deaths?” I asked quietly.“Twenty-seven so far, two children,” Silvie said sadly. “The Chief says the count will climb higher. They are expecting three figures.” In horror, I gasped and shook my head.“No!” I denied.“Yes, reports say six inches of rain fell from the skies, adding to the heavy rainfall this past week. All in all, reports are saying that over the last week over ten inches of rain has fallen. It just collapsed the flood defences, overran the dam, which was already high and… jeez, Carly. Dozens of homes are gone, and the missing is in triple figures,” Silvie said with tears welling in her eyes.“Where are the old ladies?” I asked.“At the front line, helping wherever they can. Serving food, drinks, handing out blankets and so on. All the children are at Reading Hall, Phoe called in her security team, and the older kids are looking after the younger ones. Micah and Jodie wanted to help, but Phoe begged them to watch the kids, so they freed up the old ladies. Willow, Rosie, and Serenity are helping at the Hall.”“Silvie, I’m surprised they made it to the Hall,” I said. I thought that Nemo Road, off of South Canyon Road, would have flooded too.“No, South Canyon Road is fine; there’re trees down and a few boulders in the roads, but the elder kids got the smaller ones to the Hall just fine. The roads where the creek has burst are badly affected. Flood defences have failed everywhere. No that’s wrong, flood defences held for the most part, but the creek overflowed in other places. Shit’s a mess out there.”“Silvie, the teams? How long are they out there?” Silvie’s face scrunched. Shit, I didn’t like that look.“The teams were pulling twelve hours shifts searching,” Silvie said slowly.“Spit it out,” I demanded.“Rage, Hawthorne’s and the RCPD refused to come in and camped out in the Hills. They were at breaking point when Chief Hawthorne forced them to return. Idiots were out for thirty-six hours,” Silvie said and made a moue with her mouth. Crap, I agreed. Those teams would push themselves, thinking they had stuff to prove.“What’s the damage at, monetary wise?” I asked. Silvie winced.“At the moment, they’re saying twenty million, they’re expecting it to double the next twenty-four hours and possibly even triple. The flood carried into town, including the areas around Canyon Lake Park. It stopped just past Founders Park, and it’s gone as wide as Cedar Ridge townhouses, and there’s damage as far as the Arrowhead Estates. The creek burst its bank in multiple places.The flood alert system got the warning out, they evacuated many people, but some refused to leave their homes. Rescuers are fighting on multiple fronts, flood control, debris, homeless, shoring up the remaining flood defences. The National Guard has arrived, and more are incoming. Red Cross is actively setting up refuge areas, and help is coming from local states. The area flooded is huge; rescue workers are working themselves to the bone,” Silvie sighed. And I guessed Silvie meant those closest to us as well. That made sense. Rage had a dedicated sense of community, and so did their old ladies.“Hellfire?” I croaked, knowing that Rage’s brother club wouldn’t be far behind them.“They’re here and on teams,” Silvie replied.“Who’s with Harley?” I asked.“Carly, we’ve been struggling; I’m going across to him in a moment,” Silvie said.“Can I share Harley’s room?” I asked, and Silvie shrugged. “Look, I’m not going anywhere you said for a couple of days. So I can share with Harley, and then we can free up the person due to sit with him. Even when discharged, I can still sit with Harley, as I won’t be good for anything else,” I argued.“That makes sense and would ease the worry off everyone,” Silvie said. “Let me grab a nurse.” Two hours later, I was parked in a bed in Harley’s private room, and my belongings had followed. Worried, I told Silvie to go and picked up the latest book that was being read to Harley. I sniggered as I saw it was Frankenstein. Opening the cover, I began reading it to the boy that had two MCs dancing around him.◆◆◆ It was dark when I smelt something nasty, and I opened my eyes and spied Rock standing beside my bed. Dear God, he smelt awful and looked shattered, but his gaze was firmly focused on me.“How are you doing?” I asked, hauling myself up in bed and wincing as I did so. My head was fuzzy, but I knew Rock needed me right then.“Shit, baby,” Rock said and stepped backwards, “smell like shit too.” Well, I couldn’t deny that.“This room has our own private shower; do you have a change of clothes?” I asked, and Rock nodded and pointed to a bag.“Yeah, I got eight hours downtime, Chief insisted.”“Shower and come to bed,” I whispered, glancing at Harley, who hadn’t stirred. Rock hesitated, and I saw sorrow in his eyes.“What happened?” I whispered. Rock swallowed hard, and panic rose.“Dragged three babies out of a flooded house; we were minutes too late for their parents,” Rock said hoarsely, and I saw the abject misery in his eyes. Sadly, I automatically reached out to him. Rock hesitated, no doubt aware of his foul odour, but I leaned forward to grab him. Rock came willingly into my arms. Hoarse sobs broke from Rock, and I hugged him tightly. I ran a hand through Rock’s hair and down his back and back up again while holding him tightly against my badly bruised ribs.Yeah, it freaking hurt. But who cared when Rock was in so much pain? And worse of the worse, hauling dead parents from a house. Rock sobbed, but it was so heartbroken I wondered if he’d be haunted by the failure to rescue the parents in time. There was so many needing help and so few to help. The teams couldn’t be everywhere, and Rock had to understand that. But my heart hurt because Rock hurt.And it proved how much Rock needed, loved, and trusted me. This man had been an oak tree alone for years, silent, stern, gruff, arrogant, but he felt so profoundly. Rock projected a wall that was so high not even a high jumper could breach it. He was aptly named Rock, strong and durable but will crack under the right pressure. And the pressure of this dreadful storm and flooding, the mudslides and flooded homes, damaged property and innocent lives lost was the crack that opened into a crevasse.Calmly, I rocked him back and forth in my arms as Rock clung to me like I was his lifeline. Rock buried his head in my neck, and I held him there, allowing his hot tears to scald me. The door opened, and Drake entered, appearing as every bit as broken as Rock. Drake collapsed in the chair next to Harley and stared at his son. Every ounce of pain was clearly etched into Drake’s face as he contemplated Harley. Rock’s tears slowed, and he wiped his eyes and lifted his head.“Go shower,” I whispered, and Rock nodded without even glancing at Drake. Rock bent and grabbed his bag and disappeared. “Drake, come here,” I ordered, but I don’t think he heard me. I repeated my words and saw the same misery in Drake’s eyes as he finally glanced at me.“Don’t make me get out of bed Drake, I don’t think I can, but I will certainly try,” I threatened. Drake rose to his feet and trudged over to me. Shit, Drake smelt even worse than Rock, but I sucked it up as Drake sat on my bed and silent tears ran down his face. I folded Drake into my arms and offered comfort as the huge, strong, amazing president of Rage cried like a baby. Rock was aware of what was happening because he stayed in that tiny bathroom.Drake clung to me, holding me tightly and possibly adding more accidental bruises. But that was okay because Drake needed someone to hold him, not to speak or offer false comfort. Just to let Drake deal with his emotions and pain and be his sponge. Soak it up so Drake could go back out in eight hours and repeat his actions of today. I’d mention therapy to Phoe when we next spoke.“The youngest was two Carly, fuckin’ two, clinging to her mother. If we’d got there half an hour earlier, the parents would be alive,” Drake said on a choking sob.“And how could you have got there earlier? What were you doing beforehand?” I whispered into Drake’s ear.“Was hauling a woman and two children out of a car that was swept away; they’d been there two days barely hanging on,” Drake muttered.“So you’d have left that family to die?” I asked, knowing there was no way Drake would have considered leaving them. Drake shook his head. “Sometimes Drake, there is no right or wrong, no easy way, choose one route and innocents die, choose another, the same happens. That woman and her children are alive because you and Rock got to her. Those parents, it’s an awful tragedy but not yours to carry. It’s Gods; it was his will you saved that woman and her children. His will that he called the parents to him. God knows you’re strong enough, Drake, to handle this, or he wouldn’t have dealt you this hand,” I said.“Didn’t think you were religious,” Drake muttered, wiping his eyes.“Sometimes I go to church, and I believe in God. And Drake, if Rage couldn’t reach those parents, no one could have. Shit’s as simple as that,” I whispered, stroking the harsh planes of his face and soothing worry lines.“Gonna haunt me, babe; the kids were clinging to their parents crying,” Drake said.“Yeah, but you’re a good man, Drake, and you’ll make peace with this. It will just take time,” I whispered, and he nodded.“Thanks, babe, I couldn’t take this home to Phoe,” Drake said and wiped the last tear from his face. Rock exited the bathroom, and Drake, studiously keeping his face averted, stumbled to the bathroom and disappeared. Rock didn’t say a word but dropped his bag and climbed into bed with me. He wrapped himself around me and fell straight to sleep. By the time Drake finished, Rock’s gentle snores were echoing off the walls. I told Drake to take the daybed and laid down holding Rock tightly.When I woke the following day, Rock and Drake were gone. But I felt more able to move my body and got out of bed and showered, and climbed into a chair. Those minor tasks sucked my energy away, and I picked up Harley’s book and began reading to him while holding his hand. I was so tired and engrossed in the story, I almost missed it. A faint twitch in my hand. Surprised, I held my breath as I looked up and focused on Harley. His face was impassive, peaceful, and his eyes were shut. A slight frown crossed my brow, and I bent my head and began reading again, and the twitch happened a second time, stronger now.“Harley?” I whispered, gazing at the boy. His eyelids flickered, and his eyes moved behind his lids. “Oh my God, Harley, open your eyes if you can hear me!” Minutes ticked by, the clock loudly announcing each passing second. Then a third twitch and Harley’s hand squeezed mine tightly.“Oh my God, Harley!” I cried. “Open your eyes, beautiful boy!” I demanded, and his eyelids fluttered as he struggled to obey. And then suddenly, I was staring into his confused, soft brown eyes. Harley moved his head as if searching his surroundings, and a lock of ash blond hair fell over his face. I swept it away and pressed the button for the on-call nurse.“Harley, stay with me, stay with me. It’s Carly. Do you remember me?” I babbled frantically. Harley’s mouth moved, and in a croak, said one word.“C… C… C… Carly.”“Yes, it’s me, it’s me. Harley stay awake honey, where is that damned nurse?” I gasped, pressing the button frantically. A nurse strode in, disapproval on her face as she opened her mouth to berate me for being impatient.“Harley’s awake!” I yelled, and she turned a surprised gaze on the boy staring at her.“I’ll call the doctors,” she said and hurried out the door. Overwhelmed, I fumbled for the replacement phone Silvie had brought me and finally managed, with shaking hands, to hit the call button.“Phoe!” I shrieked, deafening her. “Harley’s awake. He’s awake!” I yelled and burst into emotional tears.◆◆◆ The room had been chaos ever since I hit the nurse button. Doc Paul arrived within minutes, swiftly followed by Harley’s neurosurgeon and several other specialists. Harley remained confused, his hand clinging tightly to mine as he was poked and prodded and questioned. I knew it would take time for Phoe or Drake to arrive, and I was closest and assumed the role of Harley’s protector. Obviously, he’d no idea what was happening, and their questions made Harley even more confused.“Enough!” I finally snapped at everyone. “Harley hasn’t a clue what’s going on, and you’re overwhelming him. Leave until his parents get here so they can explain.” Doc Paul agreed and ushered everyone out, despite several doctors trying to overrule him.“Carly,” Harley stuttered.“It’s okay, honey. I know things are confusing. But you’re in the hospital, and Phoe and Drake are on their way,” I whispered, smoothing his hair away from his eyes.“What happened?” Harley asked hoarsely.“You had an accident, but everything’s going to be fine. We’ll move heaven and earth to make it right, Harley. I know you have questions, but let’s wait for them, okay? Fuck, I’m so relieved to see you awake,” I said.“How long?” Harley muttered, and I realised he wanted to know how long he’d been asleep. How do you tell a teenager he’d been unresponsive in a coma for over a year? Unfortunately, I didn’t have the conversation skills to drop that bombshell on him.“Just wait for your mom and dad, ay Harley?” I said. The door flew open, and Rock took up the space, his eyes focused on Harley. Rock’s face was pale, and his eyes searched the boy from head to toe before drifting back to his face.“Fuck me, son, you don’t realise how much we needed a miracle today,” Rock rumbled and strode forward to gather Harley gently in his arms. Tears pricked my eyes as Harley tried to lift his arms to hold Rock, but he lacked the strength to cling to him. Rock didn’t give a shit and held the boy as, for the second time in a day, I watched tears leak from his eyes. He dashed them away and gently settled Harley back on the bed. Rock’s hands fluttered over Harley, unsure what to do, and settled on holding Harley’s hand.“How you feeling, kid?” Rock asked.“Confused,” Harley stuttered. His eyes kept flicking towards the door.“Phoe and Drake will be here soon. I was closest to the hospital, as I was on my way back with a… friend.” Rock changed the last word. A victim is what Rock had planned to say before he choked the word off. Harley caught the slip, and a frown crossed his forehead. Despite Harley’s confusion from his coma, his mental capacities functioned just fine.“Trouble?” Harley stammered, and Rock gave a sharp nod.“A storm, bad one, Harley, but you don’t need to worry,” Rock reassured him.“Injured,” Harley asked, nodding at me.“Yeah, I had an accident, Harley, so have to stay awhile. I thought we’d be roomies,” I said and nearly leapt out of my skin. The door slammed open, and Phoe rushed through, her eyes wild and hair crazy mad where she’d been tugging at it. Her hand flew to her mouth as she spied Harley awake and staring at her.A wounded cry left her mouth, and she flew forward, shoving Rock out of the way and gathered her son. Rock grunted and stood behind her as broken sobs left Phoe’s mouth as Harley stared at us with confused eyes. Phoe’s hands touched his hair and back frantically, assuring herself Harley was awake, and her tears soaked his gown.“My boy,” Phoe sobbed, clinging tightly.“Phoe, Harley doesn’t know what’s happened,” I murmured in her ear. Phoe gave a nod to inform me she’d heard and took a couple of deep breaths. The door slammed open a third time, and Drake stood there, face haggard but full of hope. It took Drake seconds to cross the room and scoop his son and wife in his arms. For the second time in twenty-four hours, I witnessed Drake cry.I motioned to Rock to get me out of there. Drake and Phoe needed privacy, and I felt like a voyeur. Rock stepped outside and returned with a wheelchair, and I slipped into it, and Rock wheeled me from the room. As I left, I heard Drake’s deep voice rumbling reassurances to his family.◆◆◆ “How is it out there today?” I asked. Three days had passed since the storm, and I imagined it was more recovery than a rescue effort. Rock’s face was tight, the years piled on him, and he was bone tired.“Bad, we’ve still got rescues high in the Hills and roads are cut off. There’re survivors, and we’re pulling them in still, but the body count is rising. Last figure was near two hundred.” Rock stated baldly. I winced and lifted a hand to take hold of his.“When the crisis has ended, we’re going on vacation. We’re finding somewhere away from this with a cosy cabin and lots of sex,” I said, and Rock bit out a laugh.“That what you want, baby?” Rock asked.“Yeah, nothing fancy. Somewhere we can be alone and recover from these last few days,” I said.“We can do that,” Rock said and pushed me outside into the small garden the hospital kept for patients. Rock pushed me away from other patients and sat on the grass next to my chair.“Can I do anything?” I asked, reaching over for his shoulder.“Nah, baby, we know death comes with this job; it’s the… innocents we find hard,” Rock said, staring out at nothing. Swap innocents for children, I thought.“Miracles happen, Rock,” I whispered. Rock nodded, lost in thought, and I struggled out of the wheelchair and climbed into his lap. He wrapped arms around me and rested his chin on the top of my head. And we sat like that for several hours.◆◆◆ A week later, Rage was released from their rescue duties. Things resumed as normal on the forecourt and local businesses, except for their demeanours. Those who’d taken part, which was most of them, had a saddened, deadened look to them. The old ladies worried about how to manage this depression that had sunk over Rage. Phoe and Drake dealt with Harley and his recovery, thankful their boy was awake. Artemis spent so much time dragging Ace off for sex it was a wonder the man could walk. The upshot, however, was Ace improved because he was too damn tired to dwell on things.Marsha simply kidnapped Fish with the help of Texas and Axel and bundled him and their twins off on a long holiday. It was amusing watching Fish be hogtied and carried to their SUV. Silvie distracted Apache in much the same way as Artemis and Ace. Sin had taken Jett on vacation, and so had Lindsey with Lowrider. Ellen bundled Axel up in their cottage for two weeks, and Willow ended up bunking in a hotel.Penny had refused to bake anything for Texas unless he took her on a cruise, and Texas held out for twelve hours before Penny and the kids were whisked off. Gunner, Autumn and their brood toured Europe for a month. Sin dragged Jett off on a rare book buying tour for three weeks, leaving her beloved Reading Nook in her brother’s Reid’s hands. The other brothers found themselves packed off to various vacation homes that Phoe owned.I didn’t have any trouble; the moment I was released from the hospital, I scoured the web looking for a holiday I thought would suit us both. I ended up booking a three-week vacation to a ski resort in Austria. Rock seemed the type to enjoy winter sports, and I’d been right. He desperately needed the break Austria gave him. The lines faded from his face, and slowly his body relaxed as he began having fun.Until we left on vacation, Rock and I spent time with the three orphans that Rock and Drake had rescued. The State was trying to hunt a relative, but the two they’d discovered so far had been highly unsuitable. We spent hours with the two boys aged six and five and the little girl aged two. Rock worried about what would happen to them, and I fell in love with them, too. During the vacation, we face-timed them every day.The flood of Rapid City had caused millions in damage, and the cost of life had been high. Over three hundred dead, a campsite had lost fifty people alone when a flash flood had taken them unawares. But amid the tragedy, miracles occurred. Harley awoke, bringing much-needed relief to his immediate family and extended one. Phoe informed me how Chance, too, had cried when he saw his nephew awake and alert. Lex’s guilt finally disappeared. Not that Lex had anything to feel guilty about. He hadn’t been able to reach Harley in time to stop the bat from connecting with his head, but that wasn’t down to Lex.Rescuers from RCFD discovered a baby girl alive in a flooded house. Her mother barely breathing beside her, but they were alive. Two women had been rescued from a high tree they’d climbed, securing themselves with belts and ropes. Both women were severely dehydrated after five days of rationing the one water bottle they’d grabbed. A boat was discovered drifting aimlessly, and inside were five children from a different campsite whose boat had been thought lost in another flash flood. Their parents had survived and not given up hope. A car was unearthed several inches under a mudslide, and the family inside were alive.Despite the horrors the rescuers had seen, they’d also seen miracles too. Rapid City came together without anyone asking. Businesses that had survived when their rivals hadn’t, helped them begin to get back to a resemblance of normalcy. The entire HQ turned out, knocking door to door, for donations for homeless people. Phoe donated several million to a fund to get urgent supplies to the displaced survivors and paid for an entire hotel to be rented for six months for them.Ellen organised her school children into a food drive and then had them box up food parcels to be delivered. Sin and Reid spent a fortune sending out healthy lunches for two weeks for the rescuers who still searched. Shops donated items, and across the state of South Dakota, charity poured in. Little old ladies sat knitting blankets for children. The quilting clubs churned out duvets and other items. BlackRock Construction sent teams to shore up houses that could be saved until the owner’s insurance got on the job.Rapid City mourned and buried its dead and held memorials for the missing. It celebrated those who’d been saved and those who spent countless hours seeking anything with a sign of life. The local zoo and vets had rescued numerous animals, and donations had flooded in for them, too. The city came together in a way that meant the world to everyone involved. And I was proud to be part of that city, that wonderful caring city where we didn’t turn our backs on people in a time of crisis. And I was incredibly proud to call myself Rock’s old lady because, despite his rough and tumble ways, he was someone to be proud of. Something his stinking rich and arrogant family had no idea about.Meanwhile, Rock and I visited the three children and made sure they were safe and looked after. The children clung to us as some form of normalcy, while State looked for a decent relative to house them. I hated the thought of those babies ending up in foster care, and Rock did too. In fact, I hated it so much, I began asking myself silent questions that only I held the answer to.",

When we’d come away, we’d not been able to bring the Shibari items, and Rock had been adamant about not having sex until I was fully healed. That was all well, good and kind, I suppose, but I was seriously horny. Today had been torturous, as we’d hit the hot tubs, and I’d wanted to leap on Rock there and then. If not for having people around, I would have jumped his bones hours ago.Now I lay stark naked, one hand playing with my breast and the other between my legs. One way or another, Rock was going to give me hot, fast and furious sex. The shower switched off, and I imagined Rock’s cock hanging heavily between his legs. My head tilted back with a groan as I became slick under my finger. The door opened, and I heard a sharp inhale of breath.Through slitted eyes, I watched as Rock stared in hunger, and my wetness doubled. Tense, I flicked my taut nub, and my hips moved as I sought release. If Rock wouldn’t join in, then I’d get my kicks from him watching. Hell, I didn’t care how I got them as long as I got them, and Rock watching made me even hornier. My back arched as I moaned in pleasure, and I felt the tenseness between my legs. My pussy cried out for relief, and my hand left my breast, and I slipped a finger inside me.Yeah, it wasn’t Rock’s cock, but it would do. My pace sped up as I heard a growl from the doorway, and a quick glance showed Rock had dropped the towel, and his cock was rigid. Rock’s eyes were narrowed, watching intently, and he took a step towards me. Seeing how I affected Rock, urged my passion to newer heights, and I cried out again as my muscles spasmed and clenched. With a shattering cry, I came and collapsed back on the bed. Seconds later, Rock lifted me up and collapsed on his back and pulled me onto him. Rock’s cock surged deep inside, and I yelled as I felt him thrust deeper.“Yes,” I cried as Rock held my hips and his own rocked against me. Pressure built again as he sought his release inside me. With a guttural cry, Rock surged, and I felt him spill. Rock thrust several more times and collapsed back against the bed. I felt cheated, but there was a wicked glint in his eyes. Without a word, Rock lifted me off him and sat me on the bed as he strolled into the bathroom and brought out a washcloth.He cleaned me carefully and threw the cloth to one side, and with a firm hand, he pushed me back onto the bed. Rock’s heavy muscled body covered me as he took my mouth in a claiming kiss. I wriggled under him, and Rock nipped my lip before taking control of my mouth. By the time Rock finished kissing me senseless, I was wet and panting harshly under him. Rock’s teeth nibbled on the lobe of my ear, a spot we’d discovered highly aroused me, and I dug my nails into his back. Rock’s content growl told me he knew what he was doing. This was punishment for making him watch. In revenge, my hand crept down and pinched his ass hard, and Rock jumped. One large hand gathered mine up and pinned them to the bed as his hips thrust against me.Rock’s mouth teased and taunted my nipples, offering glimpses of pain and pleasure in equal amounts, and I slipped a hand between us and cupped his cock. Rock loved the tip of it being teased, and I began moving a finger around the pearl of pre-cum he’d leaked. And his cock twitched in excitement.His mouth moved to my stomach, kissing the welts as he did every time we made love. I’d not yet had my tattoos done because of what had happened, but Rock had designed me several. Rock took his time loving and lavishing them with attention, and his finger slipped inside me, causing me to jerk. Rock’s mouth descended, and his tongue ran from my entrance to my nub. As soon as he touched it, I cried out and lifted my hips, and Rock pushed me back.Desire having flooded my veins threatened to drive me insane as Rock’s tongue did as he wished and drove me wild. Rock’s finger was joined by a second as he thrust into me, urging me to come. Rock withdrew his fingers, and both his hands held my hips, and I screamed in frustration. He now controlled me, and I couldn’t move against his mouth like I wished. Smugness hit me as Rock lavished attention on my nub and entrance, sliding his tongue in and out, using his broad shoulders to keep my legs far apart. My lack of control heightened my sensitivity, and with a scream, I came in his mouth.Rock milked me dry and rose above me, my dark devil, and slid inside me smoothly. The moment Rock did, my legs closed around his waist, driving him deeper into me. I loved the feeling of being impaled, and he thrust against me, grunts giving away his urgency. Rock’s pace fastened, and he pushed deeper, holding me tightly to him, and with a loud cry of his own, I felt him spill a second time. Rock collapsed sideways, rolling me with him, so I lay on top.“Fuck me, Carly, I’ll never get enough of you,” Rock muttered into my neck. Our bodies were slicked with sweat and evidence of our pleasure.“Me either, I need you like I need air,” I replied.“Good, because when I’m in your veins and all you can think of is me, I’m putting a ring on you,” Rock said, and my body went stiff.“A claiming ring or wedding ring?” I whispered, unsure of the meaning.“Only one ring matters,” Rock said, letting his head fall back onto the pillows.“Wedding?” I asked, unsure still. Rock opened his eyes and gave me a “duh” look, and I had my answer.“Ain’t no other ring worth mentioning,” Rock said and reached over to clean us both. With a happy noise, Rock tucked me into his side and held me tightly. My leg crept over his to hold Rock tightly, and I dozed off, safe and sound, with a man who’d go to hell and back to keep me safe.◆◆◆ “Hans Smidt is claiming a breach of contract,” Ramirez said, shaking his head in disbelief. Hans hadn’t woken until we got back from our vacation, and Ramirez had arrested him yesterday.“Are you for real?” I asked in disbelief. Ramirez nodded his head.“Afraid so, Carly. Claims your brother signed a deal giving you to him,” Ramirez said, and Rock growled.“Does Smidt know you can’t buy a human being?” Rock asked.“Yeah, but that’s what Smidt’s going with, fuckin’ unbelievable. Can’t believe his asshole lawyer isn’t telling Smidt we can charge him with human trafficking as well as,” Ramirez replied and gave a grim chuckle.“Tonio, you throwing the book at Hans?” I asked, holding Rock’s hand for reassurance.“Fuck yes, Carly. We don’t want this shit in our city. Bastard crossed state lines as well. Asshole’s going down girl, you don’t need to worry. We recovered the body of your brother,” Ramirez said. Unconcerned, I shrugged.“And? Throw Otis on the trash heap. Any sign of Elrond and Chester?” I asked. Otis was the ringleader, but the others were as mean as rattlesnakes. And I didn’t much enjoy the idea of looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.“No, we’ve sent locals out to inform them of Otis’s death, but they weren’t there. RCPD informed Barney, but there’s not much he can do from behind bars.” Ah yes, the judge had denied Barney bail for my attempted kidnapping.“Don’t care, Otis can rot on a compost heap. Tonio, I’m not claiming Otis. Do you need another statement?” I asked. Ramirez shook his head.“Just be ready to testify in court, honey. Your twat-head brother plans to fight this shit. But Barney and Smidt have been caught bang to rights.”“Okay, I was aware I had to testify, so not a problem,” I quipped lightly. Sure, I’d go to court, anything to free myself of my brothers. Now we just had to find Chester and Elrond because they were hiding somewhere. They weren’t clever, just typical inbred hillbillies, and I shook myself. Mom had come from a good background; it was Dad’s genes that had screwed them up. Luckily, I took after Mom.“Keep us updated?” Rock asked as Ramirez got to his feet.“Sure, if we spot Carly’s brothers, we’ll call,” Ramirez said agreeably and left the clubhouse.“Babe, I got to pop and check a project. Fancy coming?” Rock asked, and I nodded. I knew that he and Apache had several major projects going. They were converting the former small warehouse district to apartments and a decent suburb. Shops were being built to encourage people to move. They had also designed a park for children and were ensuring the new housing ran on green energy.Rock strode out of the clubhouse with me on his heels. Before Rock could even complain, I had jammed on my helmet. I didn’t get it; the brothers rode without helmets, but God forbid their old ladies did. Rock swung on to his Harley, and I climbed up behind him. Wrapping my arms firmly around his tight stomach, I laid my head on his back as Rock throttled the bike and pulled away. I loved the feel of the bike between my legs; power and sexiness rolled into one. Plus, I loved how intimate it was between Rock and me.No way could anyone say driving in a car was as intimate as this. We were joined as one as Rock steered the bike through the streets, heading out to the warehouse district. I’d guessed right when I saw where we were going. This area hadn’t been touched by the floods. It was on the other side, away from the Black Hills and instead overlooked the ranches that surrounded it. The countryside remained beautiful, framed by the mountains in the distance.Rock passed through a huge open gate with a big sign saying, ‘BlackRock Construction’, and rode towards a warehouse on the right. He parked up, and I climbed off and yanked my helmet off before gazing around curiously. I was surprised at what I’d found. From what I understood, the area was a real dump. It had been an eyesore for so long that the city sold it cheap.Now activity bustled around. There were thirty abandoned warehouses of various sizes. From what I saw, some were finished, others halfway done, and some were in original condition. The one we stopped outside was finished, and I gazed in a studied manner, taking in the difference between it and the others.The converted warehouse was medium-sized and two stories high. It had a brick facing and had been cleaned. The bottom level started with an entrance to the right, followed by two windows. It repeated the pattern until there were twelve doors. I guessed that meant either twelve apartments or condos.“Are they apartments or houses?” I asked.“Condo’s up and down and spacious inside. Carly, come and see,” Rock smiled, opening the door to the nearest apartment. Rock threw me a pair of booties to protect the flooring, and I shoved them on over my sneakers. We entered a hallway with stairs ahead of us. The floor was wooden, and the walls were a cool cream. Rock opened the door to my right, and I stepped into a large living room split into three sections. The following section held a dining table and behind that was the open-plan kitchen.“There’s under-stairs cupboard space and a downstairs cloakroom,” Rock said, opening two doors, and I peeked inside them. Both were generous spaces. Upstairs I discovered three bedrooms and another family bathroom.“Are they all like this?” I asked, meaning the space and décor. Each room was a calm cream, with wooden floors and high ceilings.“In this block, yes. We’ve changed details from block to block,” Rock said as he checked something in the bathroom.“I like them,” I said, smiling as Rock poked his head out. He smiled back.“Good,” Rock grunted and stepped out.“Are you doing the same layout with every warehouse?” I asked.“No, the one at the very centre we’re converting to units for shops. It will be the centre of the community, and it’s the largest warehouse here. The upper floor will be split into a community centre and other stuff. Some warehouses we’re making penthouses, other apartments and some into condos like those you just saw. We’ve got a large area cleared where a former warehouse was, and we’re making that a park.Some we’ll convert into a garage underneath with an apartment above. There’s been a lot of interest. But this housing is affordable; we’ve got plans in place to help people get back on their feet. And to help people who can’t get a mortgage due to blacklisting. While we have some penthouses and more expensive housing, it’s mixed in amongst this. We wanted to build a community, not another area to separate rich from poor.”“That’s a great idea,” I said as Rock led us outside and across the road and into another building. This was what Rock must have meant. The downstairs was outfitted as a garage, or it could be used as a workroom. There was a locked door which Rock opened, and we went upstairs into a large open-plan apartment. Two bedrooms and a bathroom were tucked away, and I nodded in approval at the living space.“Oh, I’d have liked this,” I said, giving my stamp of approval. There were lots of brickwork and metal beams, and enormous glass windows letting light stream in.“I prefer cosy.” Rock shrugged, and I glanced at him.“Yes, I do too,” I said, wondering if Rock thought I wasn’t happy at his Grandparents’ home.“Yeah, I know, baby, but this has its appeal,” Rock said, nodding. Rock pulled me around several warehouses, commenting on things with his team leaders and foremen. I was surprised to find each building had a team leader, and they reported to one of four foremen. Each foreman took a design, so penthouse, condo, apartment or the garage conversion. Finally, Rock seemed happy with what he’d seen, despite giving the men a list of tasks. We got back on the bike and headed towards the foster home where six-year-old Blake, five-year-old Harrison and two-year-old Bonnie were staying.We’d become very close to the kids over the six weeks since the flood, and to our sadness, no relatives had been found. The state was looking at adoption but keeping them together was going to be a massive task. When we arrived, we saw the child worker outside the house speaking to the foster mom. Ms Jones raised a hand in greeting.“Let’s put our names in the pot,” I said on impulse to Rock. Rock’s body tensed as I swung off the bike and faced him.“What?” Rock bit out.“Come on, we both love those kids to bits, and we have a home we can offer. Let’s get our name on the list to adopt them,” I insisted.“Fuck Carly, thought you wanted our own?” Rock asked, holding my gaze.“Yeah, but I don’t want to carry a child just yet, but it doesn’t mean we can’t love the terrible trio,” I replied.“Are you sure?” Rock asked.“Yeah.”“Let’s speak to Ms Jones,” Rock said, swinging off the bike and grabbing my hand. Ms Jones looked up with a smile as we approached at speed.◆◆◆ I was pulling weeds from the flower bed when Rock arrived home from work several nights later. I’d beaten Rock home because he’d gone to check on another job site. Dinner was cooking, and so I’d come out here to tackle the vegetable gardens his grandmother had planted. It was a thankless task; I’d realised after an hour. The beds were completely overgrown, and I was wrestling a particularly stubborn one when I fell backwards and landed on my ass. Rock stood behind me, laughing.“Oh shush you, can’t we hire Ezra?” I asked grumpily.“Already did, so don’t know why you’re weeding,” Rock said, chuckling.“You’re not funny, mister,” I said as Rock reached out a hand and took mine and hauled me to my feet.“Dinner cooking?” Rock asked, sniffing the air.“Yeah, southern fried chicken, salad, and homemade slaw. I also made bread,” I said, and Rock looked like he’d died and gone to heaven.“Man, I love homemade bread,” Rock said, and I nodded. Yup, I knew that, which is why I’d made it.“Want to go to the bar tonight?” Rock asked, and I shook my head.“No, I’d rather stay home if okay with you. Just chill out. Things were hectic in Made by Rage today,” I replied as we walked back inside, hip to hip.“Yeah, I heard Gunner had to be restrained before he brained someone,” Rock grunted, amused.“He was so angry! I don’t think I’ve ever seen Gunner that mad before,” I exclaimed, and Rock chuckled again.“Gunner’s quiet but has a temper. That dude insulted him and is lucky to have walked out.” Oh yeah, he had been. A customer had been looking through the Made by Rage window in the part of the shop that Gunner and Manny worked their magic. He’d banged on the glass several times to get Gunner’s attention and, when that didn’t work, loudly insulted him. Gunner had come out, and although his jaw had been clenched, he’d been polite, well, polite for Gunner.Once Gunner had denied the man’s request, things had turned nasty. The man insulted Gunner and Gunner got in his face. Which wasn’t a great idea for the customer, as Gunner held a mallet and chisel. Lex had raced over and shoved the customer out before Gunner shoved the chisel somewhere the man wouldn’t want it. Gunner had returned to work after a string of vicious insults and turned his music up loud, drowning any further distractions out.“Gunner was fuming,” I said as I washed my hands and turned to check on dinner.“Weren’t happy when Autumn arrived either. Autumn took one glance at him and told Gunner to get his ass to the bar and come home in a better mood,” Rock said, amused.“Autumn’s great for him,” I said, remembering how torn we’d been. Gunner had been with Silvie when Autumn exploded into his life. Honourably, Gunner had shoved his own needs and desires aside while he tried to make things work with Silvie. Although at the time, half of us wanted to smack Gunner round the back of his head, and the rest wanted to throttle him. But things worked out as they should. Gunner and Autumn were deliriously happy. Well, we assumed Gunner was as he offered a rare smile now and then.My thoughts turned to the latest couple, Silvie and Apache, and how happy they were. From being a complete Iceman where Silvie was concerned, Apache had turned into the Human Torch. Apache constantly kept a watch on his woman and spoiled her thoroughly. Not that Silvie was complaining. She’d gone without for many years, so being spoilt was a novelty for her. I was overjoyed to see Silvie happy.“Any news from Ms Jones?” Rock asked.“No,” I said, shaking my head. “Ms Jones said she was running our backgrounds and checking our references.”“Woman wants to move her fuckin’ ass,” Rock complained.“Red tape, honey,” I replied.“You got anything planned for tomorrow night?” Rock asked as he stole a piece of cucumber from the salad bowl.“No, and I’m so antsy at the moment I don’t know if I’m fit company,” I replied.“Fine, I’m booking Bernard’s for the five of us,” Rock said and stole another piece. I smacked his hand and missed hitting thin air.“Five?”“You, me and the kids,” Rock replied.“Any reason?” I asked.“Nope, just want to spoil my woman and the kids,” he said, grinning, and I laughed. There was a cheeky glint in his eye.“You have my permission to spoil me,” I teased.“Oh, I do, do I?” Rock said, moving around the island and pinning me against the worktop.“Well, I suppose I’ll have to take one for the team,” I giggled as Rock looked mock offended.“How about I give you one to take for the team?” Rock asked, and I snuck my arms around his neck.“Oh, if one must!” I whispered as Rock claimed my mouth. Dinner was burnt by the time we remembered it. Pizza it was!◆◆◆ A feeling of wrongness hit as I waved goodbye to Lindsey, who was staying late finishing a quilt. I’d offered to help, but the Rage gossip train was firmly in motion, and Lindsey waved me away, unconcerned. Mac was sitting with Lindsey chatting, and I nodded at both, reassured someone was with her. The strange feeling hit me as I stepped outside and looked around. Yes, something was most definitely off, and my gaze fell upon a car parked a little way up the road.A person was sitting in it, eyes firmly focused on the Rage forecourt. Quietly sneaking forward and keeping out the shadows, I peered around the corner and saw Blaze on the forecourt working on his bike. The man’s eyes were firmly focused on Blaze. Oh no, not Blaze, not by a freaking longshot! For a split second, I hesitated, wondering what to do, and snapped several photos of the car and man before looking for a weapon.Blow Rage for keeping everything so neat and tidy around the garage, I couldn’t see anything helpful. I crept back to Made by Rage and banged three times on the window, and Mac leapt the barrier and stared at me. Silently, I pointed at the car, and Mac frowned, and I mouthed Blaze while pointing to my eyes.Realisation dawned, and Mac drew his phone and sent a text and came out of the shop. Mac put a finger to his lips, and I nodded as he sent another text. Seconds later, Mac crossed the road at a jog, and I peeked at Blaze again. Blaze kept his head down, but his body was alert. Casually, Blaze straightened and swept a leg over his bike, acting like he was checking something. As I watched, Blaze started his motorcycle and roared the throttle. Moments later, a car screeched, and Mac yelled.“Watch out!” I plastered myself to the wall as the car sped past, and Blaze shot out after it. Mac was on his own bike moments later and gave chase as well. Rock came running from the clubhouse and stared at me.“Get inside!” Rock roared, and I jogged across the forecourt as Rock headed to Made by Rage. Minutes later, Lindsey was escorted inside to where Axel, Texas, and I stood.“Where is everyone?” I asked.“Drake and Phoe are at the hospital with Harley, and some are at work and others at the bar having an early drink,” Rock grunted. Sin scurried into the clubhouse, followed by Jett. Jett took off the moment Sin was inside, and I guessed he, too, was giving chase.“Never a dull moment,” Sin quipped, sinking into a chair. Rock sent her a black look, and she waved an airy hand at him.“Want a drink?” I asked, seeing how hot Sin looked.“Please, Carly, I have to pick the children up from HQ soon and would love a few minutes me time,” Sin said, and I checked her. She looked tired.“You been sleeping okay?” I asked as I fetched Sin, a chilled coke from behind the bar.“Yes, it was just crazy today, we’re running a promo on Lindsey’s new book, and everyone and their mother wanted one today,” Sin whined.“Oh?” I asked, tilting my head.“Yeah, I had Lindsey sign a load and offered them at RRP. The promo drove people in, and they bought lots of books. Luckily, I just had enough. There’s three signed copies left, so I thought I’d put them away for a prize draw or something,” Sin said.“How many did you sell?” I asked.“Two hundred,” Sin muttered.“Damn, I bet Lindsey had cramp after signing that lot,” I laughed.“No, I got her to do them over a couple of weeks. Hell Carly, I’m not that evil yet,” Sin grinned. “When Jett gets back, he can take us to Bernard’s.”“Why don’t you join Rock and me?” I offered, and Rock grunted. Oops, I wasn’t sure if that was agreement.“Sure, why not, usually we all spend time together. Sometimes it’s nice to spend time with one old lady at a time,” Sin agreed, and Rock pulled his phone and dialled Bernard.“Have you heard anything?” Sin asked, leaning towards me and whispering.“No, it’s awful this waiting shit. Rock goes from excited to sullen in the blink of an eye,” I replied.“Sorry, Carly, you and Rock must be on red-hot coals,” Sin said sympathetically.“Yeah, I wish we’d an answer, yes or no. Rock and I are invested in the kids,” I said. Sin reached over and patted my hand.“Remember, you have contacts if needed. Phoe, Antony, Andrew, you and Rock have a lot of sway if you need to use it,” Sin said.“Hope it doesn’t come to that,” I said and gazed at Rock.Jett, Mac and Blaze returned half an hour later, all three of them fuming, having lost the car when a damn truck pulled out in front of them. Blaze’s hair was rumpled from where he’d been yanking his fingers through it.“Did you get pictures?” Blaze asked, approaching me. I chucked him my phone, and he scrolled through them. “I can’t make out his face, but he’s familiar somehow.” Blaze said, sending the pictures to his phone.“Well, I didn’t want to be too obvious, Blaze,” I said, worried.“You did right, honey,” Blaze said and dropped a kiss on my head. “You going Bernard’s?” Blaze asked Rock.“Yeah, with Jett and family,” Rock replied. I was looking forward to it. Sin had been correct; we rarely did stuff like this.“My treat, our girl thought on her feet, and we have his car model and number,” Blaze said and threw Rock a card.“Don’t need it,” Rock said, throwing it back. Blaze caught it and launched it straight back at Rock.“Said my treat brother, for many things but for making my girl happy,” Blaze growled. Uh oh, Rock didn’t like Blaze calling me his.“Your girl?” Rock growled. Blaze squared up to Rock.“My girl, my best friend, my little sister, my girl,” Blaze’s tone clearly stated if Rock wanted to make something of it, Blaze was happy to rumble.“Fine,” Rock said, and I stared at him in disbelief. Rock met my gaze and smirked.“My bed you’re in,” Rock said proudly, and I rolled my eyes as Blaze groaned aloud. Rock had just found the ultimate revenge.“Come on, let’s eat!” I said and dragged Rock out of the clubhouse before Blaze found another way to rile Rock.◆◆◆ I was singing loudly and off-key when Rock approached home. It had been a fun meal, with Jett more talkative than usual, and Sin had teased him. Amelia was a happy little girl and Brooke was content to sleep on whoever would hold her. Our three had been a little unsure and shy at first, but Amelia soon wriggled her way into their hearts. We’d had a good time, and I’d been sad to see the evening end. While Rock was the eldest of us four, I didn’t believe age mattered much. Jett was his brother, and it hadn’t been an issue.Rock shook his head, and I climbed out of the car and pranced up our path. We’d dropped off the children half an hour ago, lavishing them with hugs and kisses. I opened the front door and walked in, kicking my shoes off and switching on the lights as I went. A bang sounded coming from the living room, and I thought Rock had gone there instead of upstairs where I’d been heading. Loudly calling Rock’s name, I marched back down and entered the lounge and froze as two guns turned in my direction. Chester and Elrond grinned at me.“Carly, baby, where you gone?” Rock called.“Get out!” I screamed, my vocals unfreezing.“No, come in,” Chester smirked, confident he’d the upper hand. Rock’s heavy boots stomped across the dining room, and he entered the lounge, taking in the situation at once.“Drop your weapon,” Elrond grinned. Rock frowned.“Ain’t armed,” Rock grunted. Chester rolled his eyes and pointed his gun at my head.“Three seconds, lover boy, and Carly gets a bullet straight between those pretty eyes of hers,” Chester said, grinning.“What are you doing, you fucking idiots?” I yelled at them, trying to give Rock time.“Two,” Elrond said, and Rock pulled his gun from behind his back and dropped it.“Kick it over,” Chester beckoned, and Rock did as he was told. I couldn’t believe this; I’d not noticed the door wasn’t locked when I opened it, and I’d led us into a trap.“What do you want?” Rock growled.“Our sister has to pay for what she did to our brothers,” Elrond sneered.“Seriously? Otis sold me, and Barney tried to kidnap me, and you’re blaming me?” I asked, astounded.“Yeah, you should have done as you were told,” Chester said and spat at me. I flinched back from his spittle as it just missed my face.“Leave my home now,” Rock rumbled, taking a step towards me. Elrond swung his gun around to aim at Rock.“Stay there,” I begged Rock.“Let Carly go,” Rock demanded, and Chester shook his head.“Carly has to pay. Family first, and she forgot that,” he said.“I was family, family you abused and beat. Have you forgotten that? You beat any loyalty out of me!” I yelled, terrified Rock would get hurt.“Poor Carly,” Elrond sneered, and I saw his eyes. Fuck, Elrond was high on something; this was a cluster fuck.“My brothers will come for you,” Rock threatened, and Chester turned to him.“And? You’ll both be dead, and we’ll be in the mountains. Ain’t no finding us if we don’t wanna be found.” Chester meant it. He planned to kill us both, and I recognised that mean look in his eyes. Chester was getting off on the power trip.“Who do I shoot first? Make him watch her die, or her watch him die?” Chester asked Elrond.“You got me, let Rock go; he’s innocent in this,” I begged, tears in my eyes.“Shoot him first,” Elrond said, “bitch will suffer more then.” Everything happened at once. I darted forward to tackle Elrond, who pointed his gun at Rock, and Rock dived on me from the side as two guns fired. I screamed and hit the floor as something hot pierced my shoulder. Rock landed hard on me and didn’t move, and I stared into Rock’s face as his eyes closed. A scream left me as I shoved him off, uncaring of my wound, and pushed Rock onto his back. Rock reached for his leg. A second bullet hit Rock as Chester fired a second time and danced around in joy.Anger flooded my veins as I patted Rock’s face, sobbing and calling his name. Rock’s eyelids fluttered and then stilled, and I checked for a pulse. Blood dripped down my hands as I found a faint pulse, so unlike Rock’s usual strong one.“Call an ambulance!” I shrieked, trying to cover Rock’s chest and stop the bleeding.“Not fucking likely, we’re gonna watch him bleed out,” Elrond cheered and high fived Chester. Hatred flooded me as I saw what Rock had been reaching for at his ankle. Sobbing, I pressed a hand against the nearest shot to Rock’s heart and slipped out the gun in his ankle holster. Without thinking, I aimed and fired, shooting Elrond straight between the eyes. Chester screamed as Elrond’s blood splattered his face, and he turned to me as Elrond toppled backwards.“I hate you!” I screamed, tears streaming down my face, and shot Chester in the nuts. Chester let out an unholy howl and grabbed his family jewels. A third shot came from his gun, and it grazed my head as Chester, screaming, aimed at Rock again. My gun came up, and I shot Chester straight in his head, much like Elrond.My hands scrabbled at my jeans, and I called 911, yelling for an ambulance as I tried to stop the bleeding from Rock. Rock’s pulse remained faint as I begged him repeatedly not to leave me. We were happy; how could this happen to us? We were planning to be a family with three children, and I wasn’t losing this. I wiped the blood from my brow and curled next to Rock, both my hands on his chest, trying to stop the bleeding and sobbing when he didn’t respond.",

      "content": "Chapter Nine.I lay back on the bed in the chalet and listened to Rock in the shower. When we’d come away, we’d not been able to bring the Shibari items, and Rock had been adamant about not having sex until I was fully healed. That was all well, good and kind, I suppose, but I was seriously horny. Today had been torturous, as we’d hit the hot tubs, and I’d wanted to leap on Rock there and then. If not for having people around, I would have jumped his bones hours ago.Now I lay stark naked, one hand playing with my breast and the other between my legs. One way or another, Rock was going to give me hot, fast and furious sex. The shower switched off, and I imagined Rock’s cock hanging heavily between his legs. My head tilted back with a groan as I became slick under my finger. The door opened, and I heard a sharp inhale of breath.Through slitted eyes, I watched as Rock stared in hunger, and my wetness doubled. Tense, I flicked my taut nub, and my hips moved as I sought release. If Rock wouldn’t join in, then I’d get my kicks from him watching. Hell, I didn’t care how I got them as long as I got them, and Rock watching made me even hornier. My back arched as I moaned in pleasure, and I felt the tenseness between my legs. My pussy cried out for relief, and my hand left my breast, and I slipped a finger inside me.Yeah, it wasn’t Rock’s cock, but it would do. My pace sped up as I heard a growl from the doorway, and a quick glance showed Rock had dropped the towel, and his cock was rigid. Rock’s eyes were narrowed, watching intently, and he took a step towards me. Seeing how I affected Rock, urged my passion to newer heights, and I cried out again as my muscles spasmed and clenched. With a shattering cry, I came and collapsed back on the bed. Seconds later, Rock lifted me up and collapsed on his back and pulled me onto him. Rock’s cock surged deep inside, and I yelled as I felt him thrust deeper.“Yes,” I cried as Rock held my hips and his own rocked against me. Pressure built again as he sought his release inside me. With a guttural cry, Rock surged, and I felt him spill. Rock thrust several more times and collapsed back against the bed. I felt cheated, but there was a wicked glint in his eyes. Without a word, Rock lifted me off him and sat me on the bed as he strolled into the bathroom and brought out a washcloth.He cleaned me carefully and threw the cloth to one side, and with a firm hand, he pushed me back onto the bed. Rock’s heavy muscled body covered me as he took my mouth in a claiming kiss. I wriggled under him, and Rock nipped my lip before taking control of my mouth. By the time Rock finished kissing me senseless, I was wet and panting harshly under him. Rock’s teeth nibbled on the lobe of my ear, a spot we’d discovered highly aroused me, and I dug my nails into his back. Rock’s content growl told me he knew what he was doing. This was punishment for making him watch. In revenge, my hand crept down and pinched his ass hard, and Rock jumped. One large hand gathered mine up and pinned them to the bed as his hips thrust against me.Rock’s mouth teased and taunted my nipples, offering glimpses of pain and pleasure in equal amounts, and I slipped a hand between us and cupped his cock. Rock loved the tip of it being teased, and I began moving a finger around the pearl of pre-cum he’d leaked. And his cock twitched in excitement.His mouth moved to my stomach, kissing the welts as he did every time we made love. I’d not yet had my tattoos done because of what had happened, but Rock had designed me several. Rock took his time loving and lavishing them with attention, and his finger slipped inside me, causing me to jerk. Rock’s mouth descended, and his tongue ran from my entrance to my nub. As soon as he touched it, I cried out and lifted my hips, and Rock pushed me back.Desire having flooded my veins threatened to drive me insane as Rock’s tongue did as he wished and drove me wild. Rock’s finger was joined by a second as he thrust into me, urging me to come. Rock withdrew his fingers, and both his hands held my hips, and I screamed in frustration. He now controlled me, and I couldn’t move against his mouth like I wished. Smugness hit me as Rock lavished attention on my nub and entrance, sliding his tongue in and out, using his broad shoulders to keep my legs far apart. My lack of control heightened my sensitivity, and with a scream, I came in his mouth.Rock milked me dry and rose above me, my dark devil, and slid inside me smoothly. The moment Rock did, my legs closed around his waist, driving him deeper into me. I loved the feeling of being impaled, and he thrust against me, grunts giving away his urgency. Rock’s pace fastened, and he pushed deeper, holding me tightly to him, and with a loud cry of his own, I felt him spill a second time. Rock collapsed sideways, rolling me with him, so I lay on top.“Fuck me, Carly, I’ll never get enough of you,” Rock muttered into my neck. Our bodies were slicked with sweat and evidence of our pleasure.“Me either, I need you like I need air,” I replied.“Good, because when I’m in your veins and all you can think of is me, I’m putting a ring on you,” Rock said, and my body went stiff.“A claiming ring or wedding ring?” I whispered, unsure of the meaning.“Only one ring matters,” Rock said, letting his head fall back onto the pillows.“Wedding?” I asked, unsure still. Rock opened his eyes and gave me a “duh” look, and I had my answer.“Ain’t no other ring worth mentioning,” Rock said and reached over to clean us both. With a happy noise, Rock tucked me into his side and held me tightly. My leg crept over his to hold Rock tightly, and I dozed off, safe and sound, with a man who’d go to hell and back to keep me safe.◆◆◆ “Hans Smidt is claiming a breach of contract,” Ramirez said, shaking his head in disbelief. Hans hadn’t woken until we got back from our vacation, and Ramirez had arrested him yesterday.“Are you for real?” I asked in disbelief. Ramirez nodded his head.“Afraid so, Carly. Claims your brother signed a deal giving you to him,” Ramirez said, and Rock growled.“Does Smidt know you can’t buy a human being?” Rock asked.“Yeah, but that’s what Smidt’s going with, fuckin’ unbelievable. Can’t believe his asshole lawyer isn’t telling Smidt we can charge him with human trafficking as well as,” Ramirez replied and gave a grim chuckle.“Tonio, you throwing the book at Hans?” I asked, holding Rock’s hand for reassurance.“Fuck yes, Carly. We don’t want this shit in our city. Bastard crossed state lines as well. Asshole’s going down girl, you don’t need to worry. We recovered the body of your brother,” Ramirez said. Unconcerned, I shrugged.“And? Throw Otis on the trash heap. Any sign of Elrond and Chester?” I asked. Otis was the ringleader, but the others were as mean as rattlesnakes. And I didn’t much enjoy the idea of looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.“No, we’ve sent locals out to inform them of Otis’s death, but they weren’t there. RCPD informed Barney, but there’s not much he can do from behind bars.” Ah yes, the judge had denied Barney bail for my attempted kidnapping.“Don’t care, Otis can rot on a compost heap. Tonio, I’m not claiming Otis. Do you need another statement?” I asked. Ramirez shook his head.“Just be ready to testify in court, honey. Your twat-head brother plans to fight this shit. But Barney and Smidt have been caught bang to rights.”“Okay, I was aware I had to testify, so not a problem,” I quipped lightly. Sure, I’d go to court, anything to free myself of my brothers. Now we just had to find Chester and Elrond because they were hiding somewhere. They weren’t clever, just typical inbred hillbillies, and I shook myself. Mom had come from a good background; it was Dad’s genes that had screwed them up. Luckily, I took after Mom.“Keep us updated?” Rock asked as Ramirez got to his feet.“Sure, if we spot Carly’s brothers, we’ll call,” Ramirez said agreeably and left the clubhouse.“Babe, I got to pop and check a project. Fancy coming?” Rock asked, and I nodded. I knew that he and Apache had several major projects going. They were converting the former small warehouse district to apartments and a decent suburb. Shops were being built to encourage people to move. They had also designed a park for children and were ensuring the new housing ran on green energy.Rock strode out of the clubhouse with me on his heels. Before Rock could even complain, I had jammed on my helmet. I didn’t get it; the brothers rode without helmets, but God forbid their old ladies did. Rock swung on to his Harley, and I climbed up behind him. Wrapping my arms firmly around his tight stomach, I laid my head on his back as Rock throttled the bike and pulled away. I loved the feel of the bike between my legs; power and sexiness rolled into one. Plus, I loved how intimate it was between Rock and me.No way could anyone say driving in a car was as intimate as this. We were joined as one as Rock steered the bike through the streets, heading out to the warehouse district. I’d guessed right when I saw where we were going. This area hadn’t been touched by the floods. It was on the other side, away from the Black Hills and instead overlooked the ranches that surrounded it. The countryside remained beautiful, framed by the mountains in the distance.Rock passed through a huge open gate with a big sign saying, ‘BlackRock Construction’, and rode towards a warehouse on the right. He parked up, and I climbed off and yanked my helmet off before gazing around curiously. I was surprised at what I’d found. From what I understood, the area was a real dump. It had been an eyesore for so long that the city sold it cheap.Now activity bustled around. There were thirty abandoned warehouses of various sizes. From what I saw, some were finished, others halfway done, and some were in original condition. The one we stopped outside was finished, and I gazed in a studied manner, taking in the difference between it and the others.The converted warehouse was medium-sized and two stories high. It had a brick facing and had been cleaned. The bottom level started with an entrance to the right, followed by two windows. It repeated the pattern until there were twelve doors. I guessed that meant either twelve apartments or condos.“Are they apartments or houses?” I asked.“Condo’s up and down and spacious inside. Carly, come and see,” Rock smiled, opening the door to the nearest apartment. Rock threw me a pair of booties to protect the flooring, and I shoved them on over my sneakers. We entered a hallway with stairs ahead of us. The floor was wooden, and the walls were a cool cream. Rock opened the door to my right, and I stepped into a large living room split into three sections. The following section held a dining table and behind that was the open-plan kitchen.“There’s under-stairs cupboard space and a downstairs cloakroom,” Rock said, opening two doors, and I peeked inside them. Both were generous spaces. Upstairs I discovered three bedrooms and another family bathroom.“Are they all like this?” I asked, meaning the space and décor. Each room was a calm cream, with wooden floors and high ceilings.“In this block, yes. We’ve changed details from block to block,” Rock said as he checked something in the bathroom.“I like them,” I said, smiling as Rock poked his head out. He smiled back.“Good,” Rock grunted and stepped out.“Are you doing the same layout with every warehouse?” I asked.“No, the one at the very centre we’re converting to units for shops. It will be the centre of the community, and it’s the largest warehouse here. The upper floor will be split into a community centre and other stuff. Some warehouses we’re making penthouses, other apartments and some into condos like those you just saw. We’ve got a large area cleared where a former warehouse was, and we’re making that a park.Some we’ll convert into a garage underneath with an apartment above. There’s been a lot of interest. But this housing is affordable; we’ve got plans in place to help people get back on their feet. And to help people who can’t get a mortgage due to blacklisting. While we have some penthouses and more expensive housing, it’s mixed in amongst this. We wanted to build a community, not another area to separate rich from poor.”“That’s a great idea,” I said as Rock led us outside and across the road and into another building. This was what Rock must have meant. The downstairs was outfitted as a garage, or it could be used as a workroom. There was a locked door which Rock opened, and we went upstairs into a large open-plan apartment. Two bedrooms and a bathroom were tucked away, and I nodded in approval at the living space.“Oh, I’d have liked this,” I said, giving my stamp of approval. There were lots of brickwork and metal beams, and enormous glass windows letting light stream in.“I prefer cosy.” Rock shrugged, and I glanced at him.“Yes, I do too,” I said, wondering if Rock thought I wasn’t happy at his Grandparents’ home.“Yeah, I know, baby, but this has its appeal,” Rock said, nodding. Rock pulled me around several warehouses, commenting on things with his team leaders and foremen. I was surprised to find each building had a team leader, and they reported to one of four foremen. Each foreman took a design, so penthouse, condo, apartment or the garage conversion. Finally, Rock seemed happy with what he’d seen, despite giving the men a list of tasks. We got back on the bike and headed towards the foster home where six-year-old Blake, five-year-old Harrison and two-year-old Bonnie were staying.We’d become very close to the kids over the six weeks since the flood, and to our sadness, no relatives had been found. The state was looking at adoption but keeping them together was going to be a massive task. When we arrived, we saw the child worker outside the house speaking to the foster mom. Ms Jones raised a hand in greeting.“Let’s put our names in the pot,” I said on impulse to Rock. Rock’s body tensed as I swung off the bike and faced him.“What?” Rock bit out.“Come on, we both love those kids to bits, and we have a home we can offer. Let’s get our name on the list to adopt them,” I insisted.“Fuck Carly, thought you wanted our own?” Rock asked, holding my gaze.“Yeah, but I don’t want to carry a child just yet, but it doesn’t mean we can’t love the terrible trio,” I replied.“Are you sure?” Rock asked.“Yeah.”“Let’s speak to Ms Jones,” Rock said, swinging off the bike and grabbing my hand. Ms Jones looked up with a smile as we approached at speed.◆◆◆ I was pulling weeds from the flower bed when Rock arrived home from work several nights later. I’d beaten Rock home because he’d gone to check on another job site. Dinner was cooking, and so I’d come out here to tackle the vegetable gardens his grandmother had planted. It was a thankless task; I’d realised after an hour. The beds were completely overgrown, and I was wrestling a particularly stubborn one when I fell backwards and landed on my ass. Rock stood behind me, laughing.“Oh shush you, can’t we hire Ezra?” I asked grumpily.“Already did, so don’t know why you’re weeding,” Rock said, chuckling.“You’re not funny, mister,” I said as Rock reached out a hand and took mine and hauled me to my feet.“Dinner cooking?” Rock asked, sniffing the air.“Yeah, southern fried chicken, salad, and homemade slaw. I also made bread,” I said, and Rock looked like he’d died and gone to heaven.“Man, I love homemade bread,” Rock said, and I nodded. Yup, I knew that, which is why I’d made it.“Want to go to the bar tonight?” Rock asked, and I shook my head.“No, I’d rather stay home if okay with you. Just chill out. Things were hectic in Made by Rage today,” I replied as we walked back inside, hip to hip.“Yeah, I heard Gunner had to be restrained before he brained someone,” Rock grunted, amused.“He was so angry! I don’t think I’ve ever seen Gunner that mad before,” I exclaimed, and Rock chuckled again.“Gunner’s quiet but has a temper. That dude insulted him and is lucky to have walked out.” Oh yeah, he had been. A customer had been looking through the Made by Rage window in the part of the shop that Gunner and Manny worked their magic. He’d banged on the glass several times to get Gunner’s attention and, when that didn’t work, loudly insulted him. Gunner had come out, and although his jaw had been clenched, he’d been polite, well, polite for Gunner.Once Gunner had denied the man’s request, things had turned nasty. The man insulted Gunner and Gunner got in his face. Which wasn’t a great idea for the customer, as Gunner held a mallet and chisel. Lex had raced over and shoved the customer out before Gunner shoved the chisel somewhere the man wouldn’t want it. Gunner had returned to work after a string of vicious insults and turned his music up loud, drowning any further distractions out.“Gunner was fuming,” I said as I washed my hands and turned to check on dinner.“Weren’t happy when Autumn arrived either. Autumn took one glance at him and told Gunner to get his ass to the bar and come home in a better mood,” Rock said, amused.“Autumn’s great for him,” I said, remembering how torn we’d been. Gunner had been with Silvie when Autumn exploded into his life. Honourably, Gunner had shoved his own needs and desires aside while he tried to make things work with Silvie. Although at the time, half of us wanted to smack Gunner round the back of his head, and the rest wanted to throttle him. But things worked out as they should. Gunner and Autumn were deliriously happy. Well, we assumed Gunner was as he offered a rare smile now and then.My thoughts turned to the latest couple, Silvie and Apache, and how happy they were. From being a complete Iceman where Silvie was concerned, Apache had turned into the Human Torch. Apache constantly kept a watch on his woman and spoiled her thoroughly. Not that Silvie was complaining. She’d gone without for many years, so being spoilt was a novelty for her. I was overjoyed to see Silvie happy.“Any news from Ms Jones?” Rock asked.“No,” I said, shaking my head. “Ms Jones said she was running our backgrounds and checking our references.”“Woman wants to move her fuckin’ ass,” Rock complained.“Red tape, honey,” I replied.“You got anything planned for tomorrow night?” Rock asked as he stole a piece of cucumber from the salad bowl.“No, and I’m so antsy at the moment I don’t know if I’m fit company,” I replied.“Fine, I’m booking Bernard’s for the five of us,” Rock said and stole another piece. I smacked his hand and missed hitting thin air.“Five?”“You, me and the kids,” Rock replied.“Any reason?” I asked.“Nope, just want to spoil my woman and the kids,” he said, grinning, and I laughed. There was a cheeky glint in his eye.“You have my permission to spoil me,” I teased.“Oh, I do, do I?” Rock said, moving around the island and pinning me against the worktop.“Well, I suppose I’ll have to take one for the team,” I giggled as Rock looked mock offended.“How about I give you one to take for the team?” Rock asked, and I snuck my arms around his neck.“Oh, if one must!” I whispered as Rock claimed my mouth. Dinner was burnt by the time we remembered it. Pizza it was!◆◆◆ A feeling of wrongness hit as I waved goodbye to Lindsey, who was staying late finishing a quilt. I’d offered to help, but the Rage gossip train was firmly in motion, and Lindsey waved me away, unconcerned. Mac was sitting with Lindsey chatting, and I nodded at both, reassured someone was with her. The strange feeling hit me as I stepped outside and looked around. Yes, something was most definitely off, and my gaze fell upon a car parked a little way up the road.A person was sitting in it, eyes firmly focused on the Rage forecourt. Quietly sneaking forward and keeping out the shadows, I peered around the corner and saw Blaze on the forecourt working on his bike. The man’s eyes were firmly focused on Blaze. Oh no, not Blaze, not by a freaking longshot! For a split second, I hesitated, wondering what to do, and snapped several photos of the car and man before looking for a weapon.Blow Rage for keeping everything so neat and tidy around the garage, I couldn’t see anything helpful. I crept back to Made by Rage and banged three times on the window, and Mac leapt the barrier and stared at me. Silently, I pointed at the car, and Mac frowned, and I mouthed Blaze while pointing to my eyes.Realisation dawned, and Mac drew his phone and sent a text and came out of the shop. Mac put a finger to his lips, and I nodded as he sent another text. Seconds later, Mac crossed the road at a jog, and I peeked at Blaze again. Blaze kept his head down, but his body was alert. Casually, Blaze straightened and swept a leg over his bike, acting like he was checking something. As I watched, Blaze started his motorcycle and roared the throttle. Moments later, a car screeched, and Mac yelled.“Watch out!” I plastered myself to the wall as the car sped past, and Blaze shot out after it. Mac was on his own bike moments later and gave chase as well. Rock came running from the clubhouse and stared at me.“Get inside!” Rock roared, and I jogged across the forecourt as Rock headed to Made by Rage. Minutes later, Lindsey was escorted inside to where Axel, Texas, and I stood.“Where is everyone?” I asked.“Drake and Phoe are at the hospital with Harley, and some are at work and others at the bar having an early drink,” Rock grunted. Sin scurried into the clubhouse, followed by Jett. Jett took off the moment Sin was inside, and I guessed he, too, was giving chase.“Never a dull moment,” Sin quipped, sinking into a chair. Rock sent her a black look, and she waved an airy hand at him.“Want a drink?” I asked, seeing how hot Sin looked.“Please, Carly, I have to pick the children up from HQ soon and would love a few minutes me time,” Sin said, and I checked her. She looked tired.“You been sleeping okay?” I asked as I fetched Sin, a chilled coke from behind the bar.“Yes, it was just crazy today, we’re running a promo on Lindsey’s new book, and everyone and their mother wanted one today,” Sin whined.“Oh?” I asked, tilting my head.“Yeah, I had Lindsey sign a load and offered them at RRP. The promo drove people in, and they bought lots of books. Luckily, I just had enough. There’s three signed copies left, so I thought I’d put them away for a prize draw or something,” Sin said.“How many did you sell?” I asked.“Two hundred,” Sin muttered.“Damn, I bet Lindsey had cramp after signing that lot,” I laughed.“No, I got her to do them over a couple of weeks. Hell Carly, I’m not that evil yet,” Sin grinned. “When Jett gets back, he can take us to Bernard’s.”“Why don’t you join Rock and me?” I offered, and Rock grunted. Oops, I wasn’t sure if that was agreement.“Sure, why not, usually we all spend time together. Sometimes it’s nice to spend time with one old lady at a time,” Sin agreed, and Rock pulled his phone and dialled Bernard.“Have you heard anything?” Sin asked, leaning towards me and whispering.“No, it’s awful this waiting shit. Rock goes from excited to sullen in the blink of an eye,” I replied.“Sorry, Carly, you and Rock must be on red-hot coals,” Sin said sympathetically.“Yeah, I wish we’d an answer, yes or no. Rock and I are invested in the kids,” I said. Sin reached over and patted my hand.“Remember, you have contacts if needed. Phoe, Antony, Andrew, you and Rock have a lot of sway if you need to use it,” Sin said.“Hope it doesn’t come to that,” I said and gazed at Rock.Jett, Mac and Blaze returned half an hour later, all three of them fuming, having lost the car when a damn truck pulled out in front of them. Blaze’s hair was rumpled from where he’d been yanking his fingers through it.“Did you get pictures?” Blaze asked, approaching me. I chucked him my phone, and he scrolled through them. “I can’t make out his face, but he’s familiar somehow.” Blaze said, sending the pictures to his phone.“Well, I didn’t want to be too obvious, Blaze,” I said, worried.“You did right, honey,” Blaze said and dropped a kiss on my head. “You going Bernard’s?” Blaze asked Rock.“Yeah, with Jett and family,” Rock replied. I was looking forward to it. Sin had been correct; we rarely did stuff like this.“My treat, our girl thought on her feet, and we have his car model and number,” Blaze said and threw Rock a card.“Don’t need it,” Rock said, throwing it back. Blaze caught it and launched it straight back at Rock.“Said my treat brother, for many things but for making my girl happy,” Blaze growled. Uh oh, Rock didn’t like Blaze calling me his.“Your girl?” Rock growled. Blaze squared up to Rock.“My girl, my best friend, my little sister, my girl,” Blaze’s tone clearly stated if Rock wanted to make something of it, Blaze was happy to rumble.“Fine,” Rock said, and I stared at him in disbelief. Rock met my gaze and smirked.“My bed you’re in,” Rock said proudly, and I rolled my eyes as Blaze groaned aloud. Rock had just found the ultimate revenge.“Come on, let’s eat!” I said and dragged Rock out of the clubhouse before Blaze found another way to rile Rock.◆◆◆ I was singing loudly and off-key when Rock approached home. It had been a fun meal, with Jett more talkative than usual, and Sin had teased him. Amelia was a happy little girl and Brooke was content to sleep on whoever would hold her. Our three had been a little unsure and shy at first, but Amelia soon wriggled her way into their hearts. We’d had a good time, and I’d been sad to see the evening end. While Rock was the eldest of us four, I didn’t believe age mattered much. Jett was his brother, and it hadn’t been an issue.Rock shook his head, and I climbed out of the car and pranced up our path. We’d dropped off the children half an hour ago, lavishing them with hugs and kisses. I opened the front door and walked in, kicking my shoes off and switching on the lights as I went. A bang sounded coming from the living room, and I thought Rock had gone there instead of upstairs where I’d been heading. Loudly calling Rock’s name, I marched back down and entered the lounge and froze as two guns turned in my direction. Chester and Elrond grinned at me.“Carly, baby, where you gone?” Rock called.“Get out!” I screamed, my vocals unfreezing.“No, come in,” Chester smirked, confident he’d the upper hand. Rock’s heavy boots stomped across the dining room, and he entered the lounge, taking in the situation at once.“Drop your weapon,” Elrond grinned. Rock frowned.“Ain’t armed,” Rock grunted. Chester rolled his eyes and pointed his gun at my head.“Three seconds, lover boy, and Carly gets a bullet straight between those pretty eyes of hers,” Chester said, grinning.“What are you doing, you fucking idiots?” I yelled at them, trying to give Rock time.“Two,” Elrond said, and Rock pulled his gun from behind his back and dropped it.“Kick it over,” Chester beckoned, and Rock did as he was told. I couldn’t believe this; I’d not noticed the door wasn’t locked when I opened it, and I’d led us into a trap.“What do you want?” Rock growled.“Our sister has to pay for what she did to our brothers,” Elrond sneered.“Seriously? Otis sold me, and Barney tried to kidnap me, and you’re blaming me?” I asked, astounded.“Yeah, you should have done as you were told,” Chester said and spat at me. I flinched back from his spittle as it just missed my face.“Leave my home now,” Rock rumbled, taking a step towards me. Elrond swung his gun around to aim at Rock.“Stay there,” I begged Rock.“Let Carly go,” Rock demanded, and Chester shook his head.“Carly has to pay. Family first, and she forgot that,” he said.“I was family, family you abused and beat. Have you forgotten that? You beat any loyalty out of me!” I yelled, terrified Rock would get hurt.“Poor Carly,” Elrond sneered, and I saw his eyes. Fuck, Elrond was high on something; this was a cluster fuck.“My brothers will come for you,” Rock threatened, and Chester turned to him.“And? You’ll both be dead, and we’ll be in the mountains. Ain’t no finding us if we don’t wanna be found.” Chester meant it. He planned to kill us both, and I recognised that mean look in his eyes. Chester was getting off on the power trip.“Who do I shoot first? Make him watch her die, or her watch him die?” Chester asked Elrond.“You got me, let Rock go; he’s innocent in this,” I begged, tears in my eyes.“Shoot him first,” Elrond said, “bitch will suffer more then.” Everything happened at once. I darted forward to tackle Elrond, who pointed his gun at Rock, and Rock dived on me from the side as two guns fired. I screamed and hit the floor as something hot pierced my shoulder. Rock landed hard on me and didn’t move, and I stared into Rock’s face as his eyes closed. A scream left me as I shoved him off, uncaring of my wound, and pushed Rock onto his back. Rock reached for his leg. A second bullet hit Rock as Chester fired a second time and danced around in joy.Anger flooded my veins as I patted Rock’s face, sobbing and calling his name. Rock’s eyelids fluttered and then stilled, and I checked for a pulse. Blood dripped down my hands as I found a faint pulse, so unlike Rock’s usual strong one.“Call an ambulance!” I shrieked, trying to cover Rock’s chest and stop the bleeding.“Not fucking likely, we’re gonna watch him bleed out,” Elrond cheered and high fived Chester. Hatred flooded me as I saw what Rock had been reaching for at his ankle. Sobbing, I pressed a hand against the nearest shot to Rock’s heart and slipped out the gun in his ankle holster. Without thinking, I aimed and fired, shooting Elrond straight between the eyes. Chester screamed as Elrond’s blood splattered his face, and he turned to me as Elrond toppled backwards.“I hate you!” I screamed, tears streaming down my face, and shot Chester in the nuts. Chester let out an unholy howl and grabbed his family jewels. A third shot came from his gun, and it grazed my head as Chester, screaming, aimed at Rock again. My gun came up, and I shot Chester straight in his head, much like Elrond.My hands scrabbled at my jeans, and I called 911, yelling for an ambulance as I tried to stop the bleeding from Rock. Rock’s pulse remained faint as I begged him repeatedly not to leave me. We were happy; how could this happen to us? We were planning to be a family with three children, and I wasn’t losing this. I wiped the blood from my brow and curled next to Rock, both my hands on his chest, trying to stop the bleeding and sobbing when he didn’t respond.",

      "content": "Chapter Nine.I lay back on the bed in the chalet and listened to Rock in the shower. When we’d come away, we’d not been able to bring the Shibari items, and Rock had been adamant about not having sex until I was fully healed. That was all well, good and kind, I suppose, but I was seriously horny. Today had been torturous, as we’d hit the hot tubs, and I’d wanted to leap on Rock there and then. If not for having people around, I would have jumped his bones hours ago.Now I lay stark naked, one hand playing with my breast and the other between my legs. One way or another, Rock was going to give me hot, fast and furious sex. The shower switched off, and I imagined Rock’s cock hanging heavily between his legs. My head tilted back with a groan as I became slick under my finger. The door opened, and I heard a sharp inhale of breath.Through slitted eyes, I watched as Rock stared in hunger, and my wetness doubled. Tense, I flicked my taut nub, and my hips moved as I sought release. If Rock wouldn’t join in, then I’d get my kicks from him watching. Hell, I didn’t care how I got them as long as I got them, and Rock watching made me even hornier. My back arched as I moaned in pleasure, and I felt the tenseness between my legs. My pussy cried out for relief, and my hand left my breast, and I slipped a finger inside me.Yeah, it wasn’t Rock’s cock, but it would do. My pace sped up as I heard a growl from the doorway, and a quick glance showed Rock had dropped the towel, and his cock was rigid. Rock’s eyes were narrowed, watching intently, and he took a step towards me. Seeing how I affected Rock, urged my passion to newer heights, and I cried out again as my muscles spasmed and clenched. With a shattering cry, I came and collapsed back on the bed. Seconds later, Rock lifted me up and collapsed on his back and pulled me onto him. Rock’s cock surged deep inside, and I yelled as I felt him thrust deeper.“Yes,” I cried as Rock held my hips and his own rocked against me. Pressure built again as he sought his release inside me. With a guttural cry, Rock surged, and I felt him spill. Rock thrust several more times and collapsed back against the bed. I felt cheated, but there was a wicked glint in his eyes. Without a word, Rock lifted me off him and sat me on the bed as he strolled into the bathroom and brought out a washcloth.He cleaned me carefully and threw the cloth to one side, and with a firm hand, he pushed me back onto the bed. Rock’s heavy muscled body covered me as he took my mouth in a claiming kiss. I wriggled under him, and Rock nipped my lip before taking control of my mouth. By the time Rock finished kissing me senseless, I was wet and panting harshly under him. Rock’s teeth nibbled on the lobe of my ear, a spot we’d discovered highly aroused me, and I dug my nails into his back. Rock’s content growl told me he knew what he was doing. This was punishment for making him watch. In revenge, my hand crept down and pinched his ass hard, and Rock jumped. One large hand gathered mine up and pinned them to the bed as his hips thrust against me.Rock’s mouth teased and taunted my nipples, offering glimpses of pain and pleasure in equal amounts, and I slipped a hand between us and cupped his cock. Rock loved the tip of it being teased, and I began moving a finger around the pearl of pre-cum he’d leaked. And his cock twitched in excitement.His mouth moved to my stomach, kissing the welts as he did every time we made love. I’d not yet had my tattoos done because of what had happened, but Rock had designed me several. Rock took his time loving and lavishing them with attention, and his finger slipped inside me, causing me to jerk. Rock’s mouth descended, and his tongue ran from my entrance to my nub. As soon as he touched it, I cried out and lifted my hips, and Rock pushed me back.Desire having flooded my veins threatened to drive me insane as Rock’s tongue did as he wished and drove me wild. Rock’s finger was joined by a second as he thrust into me, urging me to come. Rock withdrew his fingers, and both his hands held my hips, and I screamed in frustration. He now controlled me, and I couldn’t move against his mouth like I wished. Smugness hit me as Rock lavished attention on my nub and entrance, sliding his tongue in and out, using his broad shoulders to keep my legs far apart. My lack of control heightened my sensitivity, and with a scream, I came in his mouth.Rock milked me dry and rose above me, my dark devil, and slid inside me smoothly. The moment Rock did, my legs closed around his waist, driving him deeper into me. I loved the feeling of being impaled, and he thrust against me, grunts giving away his urgency. Rock’s pace fastened, and he pushed deeper, holding me tightly to him, and with a loud cry of his own, I felt him spill a second time. Rock collapsed sideways, rolling me with him, so I lay on top.“Fuck me, Carly, I’ll never get enough of you,” Rock muttered into my neck. Our bodies were slicked with sweat and evidence of our pleasure.“Me either, I need you like I need air,” I replied.“Good, because when I’m in your veins and all you can think of is me, I’m putting a ring on you,” Rock said, and my body went stiff.“A claiming ring or wedding ring?” I whispered, unsure of the meaning.“Only one ring matters,” Rock said, letting his head fall back onto the pillows.“Wedding?” I asked, unsure still. Rock opened his eyes and gave me a “duh” look, and I had my answer.“Ain’t no other ring worth mentioning,” Rock said and reached over to clean us both. With a happy noise, Rock tucked me into his side and held me tightly. My leg crept over his to hold Rock tightly, and I dozed off, safe and sound, with a man who’d go to hell and back to keep me safe.◆◆◆ “Hans Smidt is claiming a breach of contract,” Ramirez said, shaking his head in disbelief. Hans hadn’t woken until we got back from our vacation, and Ramirez had arrested him yesterday.“Are you for real?” I asked in disbelief. Ramirez nodded his head.“Afraid so, Carly. Claims your brother signed a deal giving you to him,” Ramirez said, and Rock growled.“Does Smidt know you can’t buy a human being?” Rock asked.“Yeah, but that’s what Smidt’s going with, fuckin’ unbelievable. Can’t believe his asshole lawyer isn’t telling Smidt we can charge him with human trafficking as well as,” Ramirez replied and gave a grim chuckle.“Tonio, you throwing the book at Hans?” I asked, holding Rock’s hand for reassurance.“Fuck yes, Carly. We don’t want this shit in our city. Bastard crossed state lines as well. Asshole’s going down girl, you don’t need to worry. We recovered the body of your brother,” Ramirez said. Unconcerned, I shrugged.“And? Throw Otis on the trash heap. Any sign of Elrond and Chester?” I asked. Otis was the ringleader, but the others were as mean as rattlesnakes. And I didn’t much enjoy the idea of looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.“No, we’ve sent locals out to inform them of Otis’s death, but they weren’t there. RCPD informed Barney, but there’s not much he can do from behind bars.” Ah yes, the judge had denied Barney bail for my attempted kidnapping.“Don’t care, Otis can rot on a compost heap. Tonio, I’m not claiming Otis. Do you need another statement?” I asked. Ramirez shook his head.“Just be ready to testify in court, honey. Your twat-head brother plans to fight this shit. But Barney and Smidt have been caught bang to rights.”“Okay, I was aware I had to testify, so not a problem,” I quipped lightly. Sure, I’d go to court, anything to free myself of my brothers. Now we just had to find Chester and Elrond because they were hiding somewhere. They weren’t clever, just typical inbred hillbillies, and I shook myself. Mom had come from a good background; it was Dad’s genes that had screwed them up. Luckily, I took after Mom.“Keep us updated?” Rock asked as Ramirez got to his feet.“Sure, if we spot Carly’s brothers, we’ll call,” Ramirez said agreeably and left the clubhouse.“Babe, I got to pop and check a project. Fancy coming?” Rock asked, and I nodded. I knew that he and Apache had several major projects going. They were converting the former small warehouse district to apartments and a decent suburb. Shops were being built to encourage people to move. They had also designed a park for children and were ensuring the new housing ran on green energy.Rock strode out of the clubhouse with me on his heels. Before Rock could even complain, I had jammed on my helmet. I didn’t get it; the brothers rode without helmets, but God forbid their old ladies did. Rock swung on to his Harley, and I climbed up behind him. Wrapping my arms firmly around his tight stomach, I laid my head on his back as Rock throttled the bike and pulled away. I loved the feel of the bike between my legs; power and sexiness rolled into one. Plus, I loved how intimate it was between Rock and me.No way could anyone say driving in a car was as intimate as this. We were joined as one as Rock steered the bike through the streets, heading out to the warehouse district. I’d guessed right when I saw where we were going. This area hadn’t been touched by the floods. It was on the other side, away from the Black Hills and instead overlooked the ranches that surrounded it. The countryside remained beautiful, framed by the mountains in the distance.Rock passed through a huge open gate with a big sign saying, ‘BlackRock Construction’, and rode towards a warehouse on the right. He parked up, and I climbed off and yanked my helmet off before gazing around curiously. I was surprised at what I’d found. From what I understood, the area was a real dump. It had been an eyesore for so long that the city sold it cheap.Now activity bustled around. There were thirty abandoned warehouses of various sizes. From what I saw, some were finished, others halfway done, and some were in original condition. The one we stopped outside was finished, and I gazed in a studied manner, taking in the difference between it and the others.The converted warehouse was medium-sized and two stories high. It had a brick facing and had been cleaned. The bottom level started with an entrance to the right, followed by two windows. It repeated the pattern until there were twelve doors. I guessed that meant either twelve apartments or condos.“Are they apartments or houses?” I asked.“Condo’s up and down and spacious inside. Carly, come and see,” Rock smiled, opening the door to the nearest apartment. Rock threw me a pair of booties to protect the flooring, and I shoved them on over my sneakers. We entered a hallway with stairs ahead of us. The floor was wooden, and the walls were a cool cream. Rock opened the door to my right, and I stepped into a large living room split into three sections. The following section held a dining table and behind that was the open-plan kitchen.“There’s under-stairs cupboard space and a downstairs cloakroom,” Rock said, opening two doors, and I peeked inside them. Both were generous spaces. Upstairs I discovered three bedrooms and another family bathroom.“Are they all like this?” I asked, meaning the space and décor. Each room was a calm cream, with wooden floors and high ceilings.“In this block, yes. We’ve changed details from block to block,” Rock said as he checked something in the bathroom.“I like them,” I said, smiling as Rock poked his head out. He smiled back.“Good,” Rock grunted and stepped out.“Are you doing the same layout with every warehouse?” I asked.“No, the one at the very centre we’re converting to units for shops. It will be the centre of the community, and it’s the largest warehouse here. The upper floor will be split into a community centre and other stuff. Some warehouses we’re making penthouses, other apartments and some into condos like those you just saw. We’ve got a large area cleared where a former warehouse was, and we’re making that a park.Some we’ll convert into a garage underneath with an apartment above. There’s been a lot of interest. But this housing is affordable; we’ve got plans in place to help people get back on their feet. And to help people who can’t get a mortgage due to blacklisting. While we have some penthouses and more expensive housing, it’s mixed in amongst this. We wanted to build a community, not another area to separate rich from poor.”“That’s a great idea,” I said as Rock led us outside and across the road and into another building. This was what Rock must have meant. The downstairs was outfitted as a garage, or it could be used as a workroom. There was a locked door which Rock opened, and we went upstairs into a large open-plan apartment. Two bedrooms and a bathroom were tucked away, and I nodded in approval at the living space.“Oh, I’d have liked this,” I said, giving my stamp of approval. There were lots of brickwork and metal beams, and enormous glass windows letting light stream in.“I prefer cosy.” Rock shrugged, and I glanced at him.“Yes, I do too,” I said, wondering if Rock thought I wasn’t happy at his Grandparents’ home.“Yeah, I know, baby, but this has its appeal,” Rock said, nodding. Rock pulled me around several warehouses, commenting on things with his team leaders and foremen. I was surprised to find each building had a team leader, and they reported to one of four foremen. Each foreman took a design, so penthouse, condo, apartment or the garage conversion. Finally, Rock seemed happy with what he’d seen, despite giving the men a list of tasks. We got back on the bike and headed towards the foster home where six-year-old Blake, five-year-old Harrison and two-year-old Bonnie were staying.We’d become very close to the kids over the six weeks since the flood, and to our sadness, no relatives had been found. The state was looking at adoption but keeping them together was going to be a massive task. When we arrived, we saw the child worker outside the house speaking to the foster mom. Ms Jones raised a hand in greeting.“Let’s put our names in the pot,” I said on impulse to Rock. Rock’s body tensed as I swung off the bike and faced him.“What?” Rock bit out.“Come on, we both love those kids to bits, and we have a home we can offer. Let’s get our name on the list to adopt them,” I insisted.“Fuck Carly, thought you wanted our own?” Rock asked, holding my gaze.“Yeah, but I don’t want to carry a child just yet, but it doesn’t mean we can’t love the terrible trio,” I replied.“Are you sure?” Rock asked.“Yeah.”“Let’s speak to Ms Jones,” Rock said, swinging off the bike and grabbing my hand. Ms Jones looked up with a smile as we approached at speed.◆◆◆ I was pulling weeds from the flower bed when Rock arrived home from work several nights later. I’d beaten Rock home because he’d gone to check on another job site. Dinner was cooking, and so I’d come out here to tackle the vegetable gardens his grandmother had planted. It was a thankless task; I’d realised after an hour. The beds were completely overgrown, and I was wrestling a particularly stubborn one when I fell backwards and landed on my ass. Rock stood behind me, laughing.“Oh shush you, can’t we hire Ezra?” I asked grumpily.“Already did, so don’t know why you’re weeding,” Rock said, chuckling.“You’re not funny, mister,” I said as Rock reached out a hand and took mine and hauled me to my feet.“Dinner cooking?” Rock asked, sniffing the air.“Yeah, southern fried chicken, salad, and homemade slaw. I also made bread,” I said, and Rock looked like he’d died and gone to heaven.“Man, I love homemade bread,” Rock said, and I nodded. Yup, I knew that, which is why I’d made it.“Want to go to the bar tonight?” Rock asked, and I shook my head.“No, I’d rather stay home if okay with you. Just chill out. Things were hectic in Made by Rage today,” I replied as we walked back inside, hip to hip.“Yeah, I heard Gunner had to be restrained before he brained someone,” Rock grunted, amused.“He was so angry! I don’t think I’ve ever seen Gunner that mad before,” I exclaimed, and Rock chuckled again.“Gunner’s quiet but has a temper. That dude insulted him and is lucky to have walked out.” Oh yeah, he had been. A customer had been looking through the Made by Rage window in the part of the shop that Gunner and Manny worked their magic. He’d banged on the glass several times to get Gunner’s attention and, when that didn’t work, loudly insulted him. Gunner had come out, and although his jaw had been clenched, he’d been polite, well, polite for Gunner.Once Gunner had denied the man’s request, things had turned nasty. The man insulted Gunner and Gunner got in his face. Which wasn’t a great idea for the customer, as Gunner held a mallet and chisel. Lex had raced over and shoved the customer out before Gunner shoved the chisel somewhere the man wouldn’t want it. Gunner had returned to work after a string of vicious insults and turned his music up loud, drowning any further distractions out.“Gunner was fuming,” I said as I washed my hands and turned to check on dinner.“Weren’t happy when Autumn arrived either. Autumn took one glance at him and told Gunner to get his ass to the bar and come home in a better mood,” Rock said, amused.“Autumn’s great for him,” I said, remembering how torn we’d been. Gunner had been with Silvie when Autumn exploded into his life. Honourably, Gunner had shoved his own needs and desires aside while he tried to make things work with Silvie. Although at the time, half of us wanted to smack Gunner round the back of his head, and the rest wanted to throttle him. But things worked out as they should. Gunner and Autumn were deliriously happy. Well, we assumed Gunner was as he offered a rare smile now and then.My thoughts turned to the latest couple, Silvie and Apache, and how happy they were. From being a complete Iceman where Silvie was concerned, Apache had turned into the Human Torch. Apache constantly kept a watch on his woman and spoiled her thoroughly. Not that Silvie was complaining. She’d gone without for many years, so being spoilt was a novelty for her. I was overjoyed to see Silvie happy.“Any news from Ms Jones?” Rock asked.“No,” I said, shaking my head. “Ms Jones said she was running our backgrounds and checking our references.”“Woman wants to move her fuckin’ ass,” Rock complained.“Red tape, honey,” I replied.“You got anything planned for tomorrow night?” Rock asked as he stole a piece of cucumber from the salad bowl.“No, and I’m so antsy at the moment I don’t know if I’m fit company,” I replied.“Fine, I’m booking Bernard’s for the five of us,” Rock said and stole another piece. I smacked his hand and missed hitting thin air.“Five?”“You, me and the kids,” Rock replied.“Any reason?” I asked.“Nope, just want to spoil my woman and the kids,” he said, grinning, and I laughed. There was a cheeky glint in his eye.“You have my permission to spoil me,” I teased.“Oh, I do, do I?” Rock said, moving around the island and pinning me against the worktop.“Well, I suppose I’ll have to take one for the team,” I giggled as Rock looked mock offended.“How about I give you one to take for the team?” Rock asked, and I snuck my arms around his neck.“Oh, if one must!” I whispered as Rock claimed my mouth. Dinner was burnt by the time we remembered it. Pizza it was!◆◆◆ A feeling of wrongness hit as I waved goodbye to Lindsey, who was staying late finishing a quilt. I’d offered to help, but the Rage gossip train was firmly in motion, and Lindsey waved me away, unconcerned. Mac was sitting with Lindsey chatting, and I nodded at both, reassured someone was with her. The strange feeling hit me as I stepped outside and looked around. Yes, something was most definitely off, and my gaze fell upon a car parked a little way up the road.A person was sitting in it, eyes firmly focused on the Rage forecourt. Quietly sneaking forward and keeping out the shadows, I peered around the corner and saw Blaze on the forecourt working on his bike. The man’s eyes were firmly focused on Blaze. Oh no, not Blaze, not by a freaking longshot! For a split second, I hesitated, wondering what to do, and snapped several photos of the car and man before looking for a weapon.Blow Rage for keeping everything so neat and tidy around the garage, I couldn’t see anything helpful. I crept back to Made by Rage and banged three times on the window, and Mac leapt the barrier and stared at me. Silently, I pointed at the car, and Mac frowned, and I mouthed Blaze while pointing to my eyes.Realisation dawned, and Mac drew his phone and sent a text and came out of the shop. Mac put a finger to his lips, and I nodded as he sent another text. Seconds later, Mac crossed the road at a jog, and I peeked at Blaze again. Blaze kept his head down, but his body was alert. Casually, Blaze straightened and swept a leg over his bike, acting like he was checking something. As I watched, Blaze started his motorcycle and roared the throttle. Moments later, a car screeched, and Mac yelled.“Watch out!” I plastered myself to the wall as the car sped past, and Blaze shot out after it. Mac was on his own bike moments later and gave chase as well. Rock came running from the clubhouse and stared at me.“Get inside!” Rock roared, and I jogged across the forecourt as Rock headed to Made by Rage. Minutes later, Lindsey was escorted inside to where Axel, Texas, and I stood.“Where is everyone?” I asked.“Drake and Phoe are at the hospital with Harley, and some are at work and others at the bar having an early drink,” Rock grunted. Sin scurried into the clubhouse, followed by Jett. Jett took off the moment Sin was inside, and I guessed he, too, was giving chase.“Never a dull moment,” Sin quipped, sinking into a chair. Rock sent her a black look, and she waved an airy hand at him.“Want a drink?” I asked, seeing how hot Sin looked.“Please, Carly, I have to pick the children up from HQ soon and would love a few minutes me time,” Sin said, and I checked her. She looked tired.“You been sleeping okay?” I asked as I fetched Sin, a chilled coke from behind the bar.“Yes, it was just crazy today, we’re running a promo on Lindsey’s new book, and everyone and their mother wanted one today,” Sin whined.“Oh?” I asked, tilting my head.“Yeah, I had Lindsey sign a load and offered them at RRP. The promo drove people in, and they bought lots of books. Luckily, I just had enough. There’s three signed copies left, so I thought I’d put them away for a prize draw or something,” Sin said.“How many did you sell?” I asked.“Two hundred,” Sin muttered.“Damn, I bet Lindsey had cramp after signing that lot,” I laughed.“No, I got her to do them over a couple of weeks. Hell Carly, I’m not that evil yet,” Sin grinned. “When Jett gets back, he can take us to Bernard’s.”“Why don’t you join Rock and me?” I offered, and Rock grunted. Oops, I wasn’t sure if that was agreement.“Sure, why not, usually we all spend time together. Sometimes it’s nice to spend time with one old lady at a time,” Sin agreed, and Rock pulled his phone and dialled Bernard.“Have you heard anything?” Sin asked, leaning towards me and whispering.“No, it’s awful this waiting shit. Rock goes from excited to sullen in the blink of an eye,” I replied.“Sorry, Carly, you and Rock must be on red-hot coals,” Sin said sympathetically.“Yeah, I wish we’d an answer, yes or no. Rock and I are invested in the kids,” I said. Sin reached over and patted my hand.“Remember, you have contacts if needed. Phoe, Antony, Andrew, you and Rock have a lot of sway if you need to use it,” Sin said.“Hope it doesn’t come to that,” I said and gazed at Rock.Jett, Mac and Blaze returned half an hour later, all three of them fuming, having lost the car when a damn truck pulled out in front of them. Blaze’s hair was rumpled from where he’d been yanking his fingers through it.“Did you get pictures?” Blaze asked, approaching me. I chucked him my phone, and he scrolled through them. “I can’t make out his face, but he’s familiar somehow.” Blaze said, sending the pictures to his phone.“Well, I didn’t want to be too obvious, Blaze,” I said, worried.“You did right, honey,” Blaze said and dropped a kiss on my head. “You going Bernard’s?” Blaze asked Rock.“Yeah, with Jett and family,” Rock replied. I was looking forward to it. Sin had been correct; we rarely did stuff like this.“My treat, our girl thought on her feet, and we have his car model and number,” Blaze said and threw Rock a card.“Don’t need it,” Rock said, throwing it back. Blaze caught it and launched it straight back at Rock.“Said my treat brother, for many things but for making my girl happy,” Blaze growled. Uh oh, Rock didn’t like Blaze calling me his.“Your girl?” Rock growled. Blaze squared up to Rock.“My girl, my best friend, my little sister, my girl,” Blaze’s tone clearly stated if Rock wanted to make something of it, Blaze was happy to rumble.“Fine,” Rock said, and I stared at him in disbelief. Rock met my gaze and smirked.“My bed you’re in,” Rock said proudly, and I rolled my eyes as Blaze groaned aloud. Rock had just found the ultimate revenge.“Come on, let’s eat!” I said and dragged Rock out of the clubhouse before Blaze found another way to rile Rock.◆◆◆ I was singing loudly and off-key when Rock approached home. It had been a fun meal, with Jett more talkative than usual, and Sin had teased him. Amelia was a happy little girl and Brooke was content to sleep on whoever would hold her. Our three had been a little unsure and shy at first, but Amelia soon wriggled her way into their hearts. We’d had a good time, and I’d been sad to see the evening end. While Rock was the eldest of us four, I didn’t believe age mattered much. Jett was his brother, and it hadn’t been an issue.Rock shook his head, and I climbed out of the car and pranced up our path. We’d dropped off the children half an hour ago, lavishing them with hugs and kisses. I opened the front door and walked in, kicking my shoes off and switching on the lights as I went. A bang sounded coming from the living room, and I thought Rock had gone there instead of upstairs where I’d been heading. Loudly calling Rock’s name, I marched back down and entered the lounge and froze as two guns turned in my direction. Chester and Elrond grinned at me.“Carly, baby, where you gone?” Rock called.“Get out!” I screamed, my vocals unfreezing.“No, come in,” Chester smirked, confident he’d the upper hand. Rock’s heavy boots stomped across the dining room, and he entered the lounge, taking in the situation at once.“Drop your weapon,” Elrond grinned. Rock frowned.“Ain’t armed,” Rock grunted. Chester rolled his eyes and pointed his gun at my head.“Three seconds, lover boy, and Carly gets a bullet straight between those pretty eyes of hers,” Chester said, grinning.“What are you doing, you fucking idiots?” I yelled at them, trying to give Rock time.“Two,” Elrond said, and Rock pulled his gun from behind his back and dropped it.“Kick it over,” Chester beckoned, and Rock did as he was told. I couldn’t believe this; I’d not noticed the door wasn’t locked when I opened it, and I’d led us into a trap.“What do you want?” Rock growled.“Our sister has to pay for what she did to our brothers,” Elrond sneered.“Seriously? Otis sold me, and Barney tried to kidnap me, and you’re blaming me?” I asked, astounded.“Yeah, you should have done as you were told,” Chester said and spat at me. I flinched back from his spittle as it just missed my face.“Leave my home now,” Rock rumbled, taking a step towards me. Elrond swung his gun around to aim at Rock.“Stay there,” I begged Rock.“Let Carly go,” Rock demanded, and Chester shook his head.“Carly has to pay. Family first, and she forgot that,” he said.“I was family, family you abused and beat. Have you forgotten that? You beat any loyalty out of me!” I yelled, terrified Rock would get hurt.“Poor Carly,” Elrond sneered, and I saw his eyes. Fuck, Elrond was high on something; this was a cluster fuck.“My brothers will come for you,” Rock threatened, and Chester turned to him.“And? You’ll both be dead, and we’ll be in the mountains. Ain’t no finding us if we don’t wanna be found.” Chester meant it. He planned to kill us both, and I recognised that mean look in his eyes. Chester was getting off on the power trip.“Who do I shoot first? Make him watch her die, or her watch him die?” Chester asked Elrond.“You got me, let Rock go; he’s innocent in this,” I begged, tears in my eyes.“Shoot him first,” Elrond said, “bitch will suffer more then.” Everything happened at once. I darted forward to tackle Elrond, who pointed his gun at Rock, and Rock dived on me from the side as two guns fired. I screamed and hit the floor as something hot pierced my shoulder. Rock landed hard on me and didn’t move, and I stared into Rock’s face as his eyes closed. A scream left me as I shoved him off, uncaring of my wound, and pushed Rock onto his back. Rock reached for his leg. A second bullet hit Rock as Chester fired a second time and danced around in joy.Anger flooded my veins as I patted Rock’s face, sobbing and calling his name. Rock’s eyelids fluttered and then stilled, and I checked for a pulse. Blood dripped down my hands as I found a faint pulse, so unlike Rock’s usual strong one.“Call an ambulance!” I shrieked, trying to cover Rock’s chest and stop the bleeding.“Not fucking likely, we’re gonna watch him bleed out,” Elrond cheered and high fived Chester. Hatred flooded me as I saw what Rock had been reaching for at his ankle. Sobbing, I pressed a hand against the nearest shot to Rock’s heart and slipped out the gun in his ankle holster. Without thinking, I aimed and fired, shooting Elrond straight between the eyes. Chester screamed as Elrond’s blood splattered his face, and he turned to me as Elrond toppled backwards.“I hate you!” I screamed, tears streaming down my face, and shot Chester in the nuts. Chester let out an unholy howl and grabbed his family jewels. A third shot came from his gun, and it grazed my head as Chester, screaming, aimed at Rock again. My gun came up, and I shot Chester straight in his head, much like Elrond.My hands scrabbled at my jeans, and I called 911, yelling for an ambulance as I tried to stop the bleeding from Rock. Rock’s pulse remained faint as I begged him repeatedly not to leave me. We were happy; how could this happen to us? We were planning to be a family with three children, and I wasn’t losing this. I wiped the blood from my brow and curled next to Rock, both my hands on his chest, trying to stop the bleeding and sobbing when he didn’t respond.",

      "content": "Chapter Ten.Drake heard Carly screaming before his ass had even cleared the doors. Animalistic howls and screeches echoed around the waiting room. Lindsey ran behind him, eyes wide with fear at the noise Carly was making. Drake rushed past a couple of nurses who were staring gobsmacked at a room and burst in, seeking Carly. Carly huddled near a corner covered in blood. Drake’s sharp eyes took in a wound on Carly’s shoulder, and a nurse and doctor were trying to get close. Lindsey crashed into his back and gasped. Carly was whiter than white, clearly injured and in shock.Her clothes were covered in blood, hers and Rocks, Drake guessed. Carly’s hands were held out in front of her, keeping the two medical staff away. She made little cries that were suddenly punctuated by a wild, loud one. Carly’s eyes were wild, and she kept glancing about, and she focused on Drake with laser intentness.“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed at Drake, lashing at him with pain in her voice.“Carly, baby,” Drake soothed, keeping his voice low pitched and calm.“No, no baby, they shot Rock, and then they took Rock!” Carly screamed, pointed at the doctor and nurse. Lindsey stepped out from behind, and Carly gazed at her.“Carly, come here,” Lindsey ordered gently. Carly shook her head and scuttled sideways, and backed herself straight into the corner. The door slammed open, and Lindsey was propelled into Drake’s side as Silvie burst through the door. Carly crouched low, her hands going over her head as she screamed. Silvie skidded to a halt and swapped a frightened gaze with Drake.“Carly, it’s me, it’s Silvie,” she soothed, trying to be heard over Carly’s cries. “Are you hurt, baby girl?”“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed, looking up at Drake. Terror flooded Carly’s face, and Drake swallowed hard.“Okay, but Rock’s in theatre now honey, you got him safe,” Silvie soothed, and Carly shook her head like a maniac.“No, I put Rock in danger. If not for my fucking family, Rock wouldn’t have been shot!” Carly cried, and tears tracked down her face. They made inroads in the dried blood on her face. Drake’s eyes narrowed, and he thought he saw a head wound. Damn, his girl wasn’t operating on all systems.“Carly, come to me,” Drake ordered, and Carly remained crouched, eying him suspiciously.“No, not until they get Rock,” she whispered malevolently, glaring at the doctor and nurse, who stood watching.“Honey, Rock’s having the bullets removed,” Silvie said gently.“They stole Rock from me,” Carly shrieked, and Lindsey winced. Drake was aware his brothers were outside, but no one entered. Carly was completely freaking out, and Drake understood why. She’d been shot in her shoulder and was favouring it. She looked to have other injuries, and she’d seen Rock gunned down trying to protect her. Taking a hard line wouldn’t work. Loudly shouting would make Carly freak even more and maybe even cause her to retaliate. Drake checked her over for signs of a weapon.“Carly, they’re fixing Rock up, baby. Now, why don’t you come here and let them fix you up?” Drake bartered. Carly cocked her head and then shook it firmly.“No!” she shouted. “Not until I know Rock’s okay. He’s gonna be okay, Drake, right? Rock will make it?” Carly’s begging broke Drake’s heart. He had to help her, help her through this and make Carly understand it wasn’t her fault. Drake knew she was blaming herself; the guilt was written across Carly’s face.“Rock will be just fine, baby,” Drake said softly.“I shot them in the head,” Carly spat, and her face turned evil and hateful. “I shot Elrond straight between the eyes and then Chester in the nuts. But Chester shot Rock again, and I shot him in the head. Bang, straight between Chester’s slitty eyes.” Drake felt pride rise in him. This girl, she was the miracle his brother had been waiting for. Carly was perfect for Rock, whether or not she realised it.“Rock would be proud, baby, that you defended yourself,” Drake said and stepped forward. Carly instantly moved to the side to avoid him. Her wild gaze was tearing him apart. Drake bled for the pain in her face and how Carly held her body defensively as if she expected Drake to hit her for endangering Rock. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, Drake just wanted to gather Carly up and soothe away her pain.“Rock will be fine, but he’ll want me to look after you,” Drake said, and Carly’s eyes latched onto his face, and Drake realised how to get Carly to obey. Damn him for using such a low trick, but if it got Carly, the help that she required, he’d do it.“Huh,” Carly said. Lindsey stepped forward, catching on quickly.“Rock won’t get better if he doesn’t know you’re looked after. Rock will want us to take care of you,” Lindsey baited. Silvie nodded in agreement.“Take care of me?” Carly dropped her gaze to her bloody hands.“Yeah, baby. Who is Rock’s Prez? His brother? Who would Rock trust to take care of you?” Drake said, stepping forward. Carly didn’t hunch back but stared at Drake.“You,” she whispered. Drake nodded and stepped closer, knowing he had her attention now.“Yeah, and if I don’t keep you safe, Carly, what will Rock do?” Drake asked.“Kick your ass,” Carly answered instantly, and her uninjured hand held the bullet wound at her shoulder.“Exactly.” Drake sat near her and waited for her to choose.“Rock would want this,” Carly muttered, and Drake nodded calmly.“Rock would. You being hurt will drive him insane,” Drake confirmed, and before the last word left his mouth, Carly scurried across the floor and launched into his lap. Drake wrapped arms around her and waved one hand at the doctor, who quietly came across and jabbed Carly with a needle. Carly stiffened in Drake’s arms, and her eyes blazed at him.“You betrayed me,” she said with wounded agony in her voice.“No, baby, I did what Rock would want me to do,” Drake muttered and pulled her tightly into his embrace. Carly didn’t have the energy to struggle. Drake realised she’d been running on adrenaline. Slowly, her head dropped, and when Drake was sure she was out, he motioned the doctor forward again. Drake gave the sleeping girl in his arms a kiss on her head.Drake’s heart had turned to stone when Ramirez had called and said Rock and Carly were both on their way to the hospital. Ramirez had said shit looked bad, but Carly was awake, albeit hysterical. Rock had taken two to the chest, and Drake’s gut clenched in pain. First Ace, then Gunner, and now Rock being shot. Rage was clean, and they were still taking bullets! Drake followed the doctors as they took Carly away and was stopped by the nurse as they arrived in the corridor leading to the operating theatre. Drake resolved to stay there until his brother and woman came out. It was going to be a long fuckin’ wait.◆◆◆ “Your girl’s gonna be mad,” Drake said to Rock many hours later. Rock opened his eyes and grunted. “I tricked Carly into getting treatment, and they sedated her,” Drake admitted, relieved to see colour in Rock’s face.“Ain’t gonna be happy,” Rock grunted.“Nah, but Carly was a mess, brother. That girl has ice in her veins until it comes to you. Broke my heart seeing Carly like that, sobbing, hysterical, frightened. Couldn’t let her suffer, and Carly needed help; she was shot too.” Rock’s eyes narrowed on Drake.“Carly’s in a room, and Blaze is with her. Carly took one to the shoulder and a graze in her hairline. I stayed with you, brother,” Drake said, resting his hand on Rock’s arm. Rock’s eyes closed, and Drake watched as his brother drew in even breaths. Relief hit as he realised everything was going to be fine. Rock and Carly were both safe, and both of them would heal.◆◆◆ “I want to sleep with him,” I demanded, as the nurse frowned at me in stern admonishment. Blaze hid a smile behind his hand as he realised I was going to be difficult.“Certainly not. This is a hospital, not a hotel,” the nurse snapped. I folded my arms.“Fine,” I said and glared. Drake had got Rock into the same room as me to recover, and I was itching to check Rock over myself. As soon as the nurse left, I threw the covers back. Blaze was at my side, knowing it was useless to stop me. Blaze helped me out of my bed and into Rocks. Instantly, I burrowed straight into Rock’s big body, patting him and checking he was whole.“Nurse will shit a brick,” Blaze warned me. I cocked open an eye, satisfied that Rock was intact, and shrugged. Ouch, that hurt. My arm was in a sling, and I’d an oversized bandage on my head. With a happy sigh, I closed my eyes and went to sleep with my good arm wrapped around Rock’s stomach.“She can’t sleep there!” an outraged voice hissed.“They’re both sleeping better for the other being there, so why not let them be?” Blaze retorted.“Because this is a hospital!” the angry nurse said indignantly. Ah, the same one as before.“And? They’re not exactly ripping up the sheets, are they? So what’s the big deal? You just said his stats are better, and clearly, Carly is helping him. Christ sake, have compassion, woman,” Blaze said irately.“Excuse me, I have compassion, but I refuse to let them sleep together. It’s enough they’re in the same room,” the nurse said.“Oh, shut up before you wake my woman. We ain’t harming anyone, and if you don’t like it, get lost. I refuse to let you check my woman and me,” Rock piped up angrily.“Now you’ve woken the patient!” the nurse snarled. Jeez, what a petty woman she was.“No, you woke us up with your negative angst. Go away; we refuse to let you touch us,” I said, refusing to open my eyes.“You can’t do that!” the nurse exclaimed.“Sure we can, you’re negative, mean, nasty, and clearly don’t care what’s best for your patient. Carly, being beside me is what’s best for me, so fuck off and take your shitty attitude elsewhere!” Rock said calmly for once.“Agreed,” I said, snuggling into Rock as he shifted in the bed to wrap an arm around me.“Blaze, let Doc Paul know we don’t want her; she’s vile,” I murmured, resting my head on Rock’s shoulder and drifting back off to sleep.I woke up feeling like I was being watched. Tiredly, I peeled open one eyelid and saw Rock’s brown eyes staring at me. His lips quirked in a small smile as he brushed my mane of hair out of my eyes.“Mornin’,” Rock murmured.“Hey,” I replied and worried about morning breath; I must be rank. Rock, however, smelt minty. I spied a pack of mints on the bedside table and snatched one, and shoved it into my mouth. That was better, no blasting Rock with yukky breath.“How you feeling?” Rock asked, his eyes raking me.“Okay, better now I know you’re okay. I’m so sorry,” I whispered. Shame crossed my face. Elrond and Chester had broken into our house and shot us. The insult was worse because it came after a fantastic night out after Bernard’s great food. It was just rude to shoot someone after eating at Bernard’s.“Don’t you ever apologise for those assholes. Fuck baby, you were born into that family; you didn’t ask for it. When I saw that gun aimed at you, my heart stopped. Thought I was going to lose everything,” Rock said, his voice shaky.“Me too. I can’t understand their mentality. Why come after us?” I asked.“Because my guess is they’ve never been told no. Those assholes, baby, they take, asking ain’t something they know how to do. Bettin’ your Dad raised them to be real class A assholes, and they bought into it. There was only one way their tragic nasty lives were going to end, Carly,” Rock said. I sighed because he wasn’t wrong. My father had ruined my brothers, taken anything decent out of them and killed it dead. Rock shifted on the bed and sat up.“Baby, I’m going for a shower and change, ain’t wearing this hospital gown. Blaze brought us loose clothing, so we ain’t gotta wear these,” Rock said, tugging at his gown and glaring. I was smirking when he shuffled out of bed and strode across to the private bathroom. Rock’s muscled ass teased me through the slit in the gown, and I bit back a grin. Yeah, Rock needed to dress. Once those randy nurses caught a load of that, there’d be trouble.◆◆◆ Doc Paul grinned as he read our charts and glanced at us on the bed. The nurse who’d been so mean earlier stood there with an expectant gaze. I held her eyes, wanting her to know there was no way I was leaving this bed. Doc Paul put the chart down, and his stance turned relaxed.“You’re both healing well, and there’re no complications. Carly, you can be discharged tomorrow and Rock in two days. But,” Doc Paul said, holding up his hand, “I imagine Carly won’t leave you. I’ll discharge you together in two days. You can tell Penny you can eat anything now. Neither of you is on a liquid diet,” Doc Paul said as the nurse’s face fell.“Penny been bugging you, Doc?” Rock asked.“Woman’s texted me ten times when she can bring proper food and not the slop we dish up,” Doc Paul grinned. The nurse made an outraged noise.“Penny’s stubborn,” Rock said.“And the food is awful here,” I agreed.“Well, I’m happy for now. Do not do anything to tear those stitches,” Doc Paul warned with a wicked glint in his eye.“Doctor, you seriously can’t mean for them to stay in the same bed?” the nurse said belligerently.“Nurse, who are they harming? They are in a private room, and if we try to dislodge one, they will both leave, which will be detrimental to their health. Plus, Phoenix made a rather large donation which I believe will be withdrawn should they be separated. For the sake of two days, suck it up and appreciate the fact they’re in love!” Doc Paul scolded, and a smug look crossed my face.◆◆◆ Several hours later, I was curled up dozing when there was a knock at the door. Rock twisted his head as the door opened, and his entire body tensed. I stared curiously at the man and woman who entered and hissed in a breath. The man was a pale version of Rock, at least thirty years older, but he’d definitely gone to seed. A jowly face and overhanging belly nearly hidden by the cut of his suit. This was Rock’s parents. Mitchell and Diana Johnson.“What do you want?” Rock growled, and I placed a hand on his arm. His entire body was strung like a wire.“Hello, son, we heard you had been shot,” the man said, his gaze sliding over me and a look of complete distaste crossing his face. If anything, Rock got even tenser.“What’s that to do with you?” Rock growled.“You’re our son,” Diana said.“Since when?” Rock shot back. He folded his arms across his chest and then thought better of it and dragged me under one holding me tightly against his side.“Heath!” Diana exclaimed, a pained expression crossing her face.“Name’s Rock,” he said with a dark look.“What stupid name is that?” Mitchell sneered, and I bristled. Mitchell’s gaze glanced at me again and dismissed me as unimportant.“The name my family gave me,” Rock replied and stared at them.“Those bikers you run around with? Honestly, Heath, you were raised better than that,” Mitchell said. Rock chuckled darkly.“You raised me to be an ass licking, yes, man. Didn’t sit well with me, so chose my own family,” Rock retorted.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell shot back, his shoulders squaring up and failing to look impressive.“Why don’t you tell me what you want and then get the hell back to ignoring my existence?” Rock drawled his eyes wary. I felt pain that they were treating Rock like this. Who did they think they were?“Son, we’ve kept tabs on you for a while,” Diana said gently but making it seem like she was offering Rock a gift.“And?” Rock grunted, not showing an ounce of leeway.“We’ve been impressed with your actions recently,” Mitchell said, and I bristled again.“Just recently?” I spat, unable to hold my tongue anymore.“And just who are you?” Diana asked icily.“Rock’s old lady,” I said, jerking my head at Rock. Diana’s lip curled in dislike, and she turned her gaze away from me. Dismissing me as beneath her worthiness. Rock tensed again under my hand. That was a mistake.“Well, your actions have proved you worthy. We want you to re-join the family,” Mitchell said. I hissed in a sharp breath. How dare they? Anger rose, but Rock’s arm squeezed me tightly.“Nah, I’m good, thanks, don’t need your poor excuse of a family,” Rock demurred.“You deny us?” Mitchell said in disbelief.“Why the fuck would you think I’d re-join your fucking family?” Rock thundered, and I jumped.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell thundered and took a visible intake of air. “You’ve proved yourself worthy, Heath. Your actions during the flood and now saving this… girl’s life were heroic. They would look great on my campaign.” My eyes nearly bugged from my head. Surely Mitchell couldn’t be serious?“Fuck you and fuck that bitch. Fuck your campaign too,” Rock said, pointing at his father and mother. “Over a decade ago, you threw me away because I wouldn’t fall into the life that you planned for me. Refused to accept I’d my own personality and desires for life. Denied me family because I wouldn’t sell my soul and kneel and obey at the feet of the great Mitchell Johnson.I was left out in the cold, and without my grandparents, I’d have had no family. Fuck you, Diana, you even cut them off because they didn’t fit in with your diamonds and Chanel. Seriously, how the fuck do you have the balls to walk into my life and tell me I’m good enough for you? You ain’t fuckin’ good enough for me!” Rock roared.“Heath…” Mitchell said, his face stern and angry.“Fuck Heath. Heath’s dead to you and has been since you kicked him out. Heath discovered a new family who accepted him and what he was. Why the hell do you think I need you in my life? I got along just fine without you, and I don’t fuckin’ need you now. And I tell ya now, any reporter seeks me out, I’ll let the damn world know how the great Mitchell Johnson treats family. Oh yeah, what a story that will make,” Rock snarled.“We’re leaving,” Mitchell growled.“Don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya,” Rock said and rolled on his side away from them. I tucked into his shoulder and heard the door slam. I was furious at how Rock’s parents had ambushed him.“You okay?” I asked.“Yeah, they don’t mean shit to me,” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my head.“That was upsetting,” I urged, hoping he’d open up and talk to me.“Nah, all Mitchell wanted to do was parade me around, bragging about his hero son. Mitchell’s right; it would have looked great on his campaign trail but fuck him. I’m not Mitchell’s puppet and haven’t been for years. I have far better things to do with my life, and dancing to his tune isn’t one of them. They threw me out and kicked me to the curb; they have no right to intrude on my life now,” Rock said firmly.I agreed wholeheartedly with him. My family was shit, total shit, and we were trailer trash rednecks. But Rock’s family hadn’t been poor like mine; they’d been well off and highly educated and not appreciated what a diamond they had. Instead, they abused and wholly misunderstood the wonderful son they had. Of course, that became a huge benefit to me. Rock and I would never have met if he’d stayed Heath Johnson.I rubbed my cheek on Rock’s chest and snuggled up. Rock lay there calmly as he assimilated what had just happened. I offered silent support as Rock chewed over the audacity of his parents, and then Rock snorted.“Fuck them, ain’t thinking about them no more. What we doing when we escape this joint?” Rock asked.“Whatever you want?” I said drowsily.“Oh yeah?” Rock teased. I slapped his firm stomach, and Rock chuckled.“Yeah.”“Want to plan a wedding?” Rock asked, and my drowsiness disappeared in the blink of an eye.“What?” I exclaimed, sitting up.“Marry me, I’ll give you a month to plan the wedding, but it has to be on Rage. Axel is conducting it, and don’t expect monkey suits or bullshit like that. But plan the wedding you want within reason,” Rock warned and mock scowled.“Wow, I’m overwhelmed by your proposal,” I said, my hand going to my heart. Rock scowled for real this time.“Ain’t a hearts and flowers guy Carly,” he warned. I sniggered; no, Rock most certainly wasn’t. But Rock was my guy, and I loved him.“So no getting on one knee?” I said, pretending to be serious.“What the fuck, Carly?” Rock growled, and I began giggling.“The look on your face!”“Woman, I’ll put you over my knee if you continue,” Rock threatened, and I broke into peals of laughter.“Is that meant to be a deterrent?” I gasped between chuckles.“Nope, a promise,” Rock said and tackled me to the bed. “Marry me.”“Yes,” I said and reached up to wrap my arms around his neck. Rock’s lips twitched into a smile of approval before he gave me his first kiss as his fiancée.◆◆◆ “Dum, dum dum, another one bites the dust,” Blaze sang, pointing at Rock. Rock launched a beer bottle at Blaze’s head, followed by an ashtray. I twisted my head, checked Rock was okay and sank back into a couch. I was listening to the old ladies plan the wedding and was heartily bored with the entire subject. Phoe was rambling about flowers, for which I arched an eyebrow at her.I’d already shot down a big white gown, limo, massive cake, and lord knows what else. All I wanted was a simple white dress, a small posy of flowers, cake, grill and Rock under an arch at the back of Rage. But making the old ladies understand that was freaking hard. I should have known better than to mention Rock had asked me to marry him.A shout made me jump, and I laughed as Rock took Blaze to the floor, wrestling. Drake snorted in amusement as Rock bounced Blaze’s head off the floor. Blaze heaved upwards, and Rock elbowed him in the belly. I rolled my eyes at Phoe, and we smiled. Blaze had been needling Rock ever since he’d found out Rock had asked me to marry him. I wasn’t sure if Blaze was acting as an irritating older brother (mine) or had finally just found a way to needle Rock. But Blaze had been a pain in Rock’s ass ever since we left the hospital. Blaze jammed an elbow into Rock’s thigh and punched him in the ribs, deliberately missing Rock’s wounds. Ace strode over and separated the wrestling men and promptly took a fist to the gut. He lifted an eye as Rock stared unabashedly back and hauled Blaze to his feet, shaking his head.“Fuckin’ children,” Ace muttered, and Axel howled with laughter. Rock smirked and strutted over to me; I imagined he thought he’d won that one.“How’s it going, baby?” Rock asked, dropping a light kiss on my lips. The old ladies stopped chatting and stared in rapt attention.“No one’s listening to me, so I give up. Can we run off to Vegas?” I bitched, and Rock’s eyes rolled.“Yeah, we can do,” Rock said, dropping another kiss on my lips. An outraged gasp sounded, and I knew Lindsey was glaring daggers at us.“Well, if they don’t listen, we can fly out this weekend,” Rock threatened, and further outraged gasps echoed. Rock winked, and I smiled against his mouth. He ran a finger down my face and knew his job was done. The old ladies would listen to me or miss out on our wedding.“Okay, what do you want?” Marsha sighed, and with a smile, I turned to face the thwarted women who were quietly fuming. Happily assured I’d be getting the wedding I wanted, I turned to Phoe and began speaking.◆◆◆ A knock surprised me as I wasn’t expecting anyone; I took the pots off the stove and turned off the gas. Strolling into the hallway, I opened the door and looked up and then again. A huge man stood in the doorway with white-blond hair and a scar running down his right cheek. A tattoo of black and red flames curled up his neck surrounding a dragon’s tail tattooed on his throat. Dark brown eyes stared at me coldly.“Carly?” his voice rumbled, and I stepped back, unsure.“Yes?” I spoke.“Don’t be afraid; I’m a friend. Need you to get a message to Drake, and I can’t go to the clubhouse because it’s being watched,” he said.“What? Who?” I stammered.“A friend Carly,” he insisted. I cocked my head and stared. A vague memory came to mind, Silvie describing someone.“You’re Ghost,” I said and stepped back, my hand searching for a weapon to defend myself.“No, I’m not a threat Carly. Rock isn’t being watched. I need Drake to receive a message. Warn him Taxman has taken over the Dark Souls of Lucifer. They have found somewhere to lie low, but I’m not aware where yet. Tell Drake I’m tracking them, and Blaze is a target. Carly, listen to me; Blaze must be protected, he’s on a hit list they have, and he’s right at the top,” Ghost said, and I stared. Ice flooded through my veins at the thought of Blaze in danger.“Why are you warning us? Because you hurt Silvie and betrayed Rage,” I hissed, my spine tingling in defence of Blaze.“No! I never ever hurt Silvie; I’d have given my life to prevent that. And I never betrayed Rage, Carly; I don’t fuckin’ care if you believe me or not. Just give Drake my warning,” Ghost insisted, his hands peacefully held by his side.“Oh, I’ll tell Drake alright, and Blaze, that you’ve put a target on his back,” I snapped.“For fuck’s sake, woman, I’m bringing a warning, don’t wanna see Rage get hurt. Blaze has a bigger target on his back than Drake does, which makes me think shit’s personal. Get Blaze to list his enemies and track them. Rage has excellent support, not that they need it, but Hawthorne will help. He’s tied to Rage tight now,” Ghost said patiently.“How does Drake contact you?” I asked.“He doesn’t. Drake can’t know shit about me other than this warning. Tell Drake to stop hunting me before he draws even more eyes,” Ghost warned, and a shiver ran down my spine again.“Bullshit,” I said. I was trying to keep Ghost talking. Rock should be home soon, and if I kept him here, Rock could handle him.“Know what you’re doing, Carly. Give Rock my warning to give to Drake,” Ghost said with a wry smile and strolled over to a bike and throttled it. He disappeared, and I cursed. Desperately, trying to keep everything Ghost said straight in my mind, I dashed back into the house and found a notepad and wrote down every word that Ghost had said. I was just finishing when pipes roared, and Rock pulled up outside our home.“Carly!” Rock called as he stomped towards me.“In here,” I called back, scribbling the last few words. Rock strolled in, and that flicker of desire flared between us. Idly I wondered if it would always be like that, a flame waiting to be stoked into a blaze.“How you doing, baby?” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my upturned face.“We had a visitor, Ghost. He came to give Drake a warning,” I said, and Rock’s face turned angry.“Say that again,” he demanded.“Ghost came here; he said he had a warning for Drake, Blaze and Rage. I’ve written it down word for word as best I could,” I said, motioning to the notepad. Rock’s face might as well have been carved from stone for all the emotion he showed. He picked up the pad and read it.“Good girl,” Rock said finally after reading it twice and dropped another kiss on my mouth before strolling away. I heard him on the phone, and then Rock returned.“Honey, Drake’s calling in the inner sanctum now. Can you turn off whatever you’re cooking and come and speak to Drake? This is too important to leave until the morning,” Rock asked gently. We spent around four nights a week at home, the other three at the clubhouse, and I cherished those nights at home. Rock was asking a lot for me to give up one of those precious nights.“Of course,” I said. There was no hesitation. This message was too important, and Drake clearly agreed.“Thank you, baby, I’ll order Bernard’s for you, get you ribs and fries delivered,” Rock bribed, and I laughed. He didn’t need to bribe me, but it was nice Rock thought about it.“With slaw and corn,” I grinned, and Rock slung an arm around my waist as he steered me outside to his bike.“And a huge double helping of Bernard’s chocolate orange sponge cake and custard.” Rock smiled. He mounted his bike, and I swung up behind him. Despite Rock smiling, he was as tense as fuck. Ghost had unsettled the status quo by coming to our home. Rock was unamused that I might have been in danger, and I could sense his brain turning matters over on how to ensure our safety here. The bike roared, and dust kicked up, and we sped off.◆◆◆ Two weeks later, we heard from child services. Luckily for us, we’d got a great social worker, and she’d been diligent at bringing Blake, Harrison, and Bonnie to us daily. Miss Winch’s investigations into Rock and I had finished, and we’d been waiting for her report. Rock and I had signed the paperwork to adopt them and were waiting to hear if child services and the court approved of us. Rock and I had attended court a week ago. Instead of giving an immediate decision, the judge had taken time to consider us as parents.I glanced at the window as a car pulled up and walked to the front door to see who’d arrived. My heart leapt into my mouth as Miss Winch got out, wearing a stern expression. Rock appeared behind me and placed his hands on my shoulders. Miss Winch opened the back door and leaned inside. When she stepped back, Bonnie tore towards us, yelling at the top of her lungs.A scream of joy left my lips as I dashed towards Bonnie and scooped her up. Bonnie babbled happily in her baby talk as Harrison followed behind and ran for Rock. Blake got out more cautiously and hesitated by Miss Winch.“The judge approved the adoption,” she said and broke into a smile.“Wonderful!” I exclaimed, hugging Bonnie tightly. Rock knelt down to Blake’s level.“Hey buddy, want to see your room?” Rock asked Blake.“Yeah,” Blake said a little sullenly.“Blake will adjust, give him time,” Miss Winch said, and I nodded.“Yeah, did you fulfil our other request?” I asked. When we’d gone to court, Rock and I had requested photos of the children and their parents. We intended to keep their parents alive for them. Miss Winch let out a beaming smile and then opened the trunk of her car. Inside were four boxes full of the children’s and their parents’ belongings. She lifted them out and put them on the ground.“This is what could be salvaged. It’s kind of you to honour their parents. Most would let their memories drop,” Miss Winch said.“We’re not most people, and their parents deserve to be remembered for their sacrifice. They should be remembered and honoured,” I replied, kissing Bonnie as she placed a smacker on my cheek.“Blake, Harrison and Bonnie are fortunate,” Miss Winch said and got back in her car.“Thank you,” I said, allowing emotion to leak into my voice.“No, thank you. Blake, Harrison and Bonnie will be thrilled. Their completed paperwork is in one of those boxes. Be lucky Carly,” Miss Winch said and pulled away.“Welcome home, honey,” I said, smiling at Bonnie, who grinned.“Carly!” Rock yelled as a boy’s laughter came from the house.“Oh dear, shall we go see what the menfolk are up to?” I asked Bonnie, who clapped her hands.",

      "content": "Chapter Ten.Drake heard Carly screaming before his ass had even cleared the doors. Animalistic howls and screeches echoed around the waiting room. Lindsey ran behind him, eyes wide with fear at the noise Carly was making. Drake rushed past a couple of nurses who were staring gobsmacked at a room and burst in, seeking Carly. Carly huddled near a corner covered in blood. Drake’s sharp eyes took in a wound on Carly’s shoulder, and a nurse and doctor were trying to get close. Lindsey crashed into his back and gasped. Carly was whiter than white, clearly injured and in shock.Her clothes were covered in blood, hers and Rocks, Drake guessed. Carly’s hands were held out in front of her, keeping the two medical staff away. She made little cries that were suddenly punctuated by a wild, loud one. Carly’s eyes were wild, and she kept glancing about, and she focused on Drake with laser intentness.“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed at Drake, lashing at him with pain in her voice.“Carly, baby,” Drake soothed, keeping his voice low pitched and calm.“No, no baby, they shot Rock, and then they took Rock!” Carly screamed, pointed at the doctor and nurse. Lindsey stepped out from behind, and Carly gazed at her.“Carly, come here,” Lindsey ordered gently. Carly shook her head and scuttled sideways, and backed herself straight into the corner. The door slammed open, and Lindsey was propelled into Drake’s side as Silvie burst through the door. Carly crouched low, her hands going over her head as she screamed. Silvie skidded to a halt and swapped a frightened gaze with Drake.“Carly, it’s me, it’s Silvie,” she soothed, trying to be heard over Carly’s cries. “Are you hurt, baby girl?”“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed, looking up at Drake. Terror flooded Carly’s face, and Drake swallowed hard.“Okay, but Rock’s in theatre now honey, you got him safe,” Silvie soothed, and Carly shook her head like a maniac.“No, I put Rock in danger. If not for my fucking family, Rock wouldn’t have been shot!” Carly cried, and tears tracked down her face. They made inroads in the dried blood on her face. Drake’s eyes narrowed, and he thought he saw a head wound. Damn, his girl wasn’t operating on all systems.“Carly, come to me,” Drake ordered, and Carly remained crouched, eying him suspiciously.“No, not until they get Rock,” she whispered malevolently, glaring at the doctor and nurse, who stood watching.“Honey, Rock’s having the bullets removed,” Silvie said gently.“They stole Rock from me,” Carly shrieked, and Lindsey winced. Drake was aware his brothers were outside, but no one entered. Carly was completely freaking out, and Drake understood why. She’d been shot in her shoulder and was favouring it. She looked to have other injuries, and she’d seen Rock gunned down trying to protect her. Taking a hard line wouldn’t work. Loudly shouting would make Carly freak even more and maybe even cause her to retaliate. Drake checked her over for signs of a weapon.“Carly, they’re fixing Rock up, baby. Now, why don’t you come here and let them fix you up?” Drake bartered. Carly cocked her head and then shook it firmly.“No!” she shouted. “Not until I know Rock’s okay. He’s gonna be okay, Drake, right? Rock will make it?” Carly’s begging broke Drake’s heart. He had to help her, help her through this and make Carly understand it wasn’t her fault. Drake knew she was blaming herself; the guilt was written across Carly’s face.“Rock will be just fine, baby,” Drake said softly.“I shot them in the head,” Carly spat, and her face turned evil and hateful. “I shot Elrond straight between the eyes and then Chester in the nuts. But Chester shot Rock again, and I shot him in the head. Bang, straight between Chester’s slitty eyes.” Drake felt pride rise in him. This girl, she was the miracle his brother had been waiting for. Carly was perfect for Rock, whether or not she realised it.“Rock would be proud, baby, that you defended yourself,” Drake said and stepped forward. Carly instantly moved to the side to avoid him. Her wild gaze was tearing him apart. Drake bled for the pain in her face and how Carly held her body defensively as if she expected Drake to hit her for endangering Rock. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, Drake just wanted to gather Carly up and soothe away her pain.“Rock will be fine, but he’ll want me to look after you,” Drake said, and Carly’s eyes latched onto his face, and Drake realised how to get Carly to obey. Damn him for using such a low trick, but if it got Carly, the help that she required, he’d do it.“Huh,” Carly said. Lindsey stepped forward, catching on quickly.“Rock won’t get better if he doesn’t know you’re looked after. Rock will want us to take care of you,” Lindsey baited. Silvie nodded in agreement.“Take care of me?” Carly dropped her gaze to her bloody hands.“Yeah, baby. Who is Rock’s Prez? His brother? Who would Rock trust to take care of you?” Drake said, stepping forward. Carly didn’t hunch back but stared at Drake.“You,” she whispered. Drake nodded and stepped closer, knowing he had her attention now.“Yeah, and if I don’t keep you safe, Carly, what will Rock do?” Drake asked.“Kick your ass,” Carly answered instantly, and her uninjured hand held the bullet wound at her shoulder.“Exactly.” Drake sat near her and waited for her to choose.“Rock would want this,” Carly muttered, and Drake nodded calmly.“Rock would. You being hurt will drive him insane,” Drake confirmed, and before the last word left his mouth, Carly scurried across the floor and launched into his lap. Drake wrapped arms around her and waved one hand at the doctor, who quietly came across and jabbed Carly with a needle. Carly stiffened in Drake’s arms, and her eyes blazed at him.“You betrayed me,” she said with wounded agony in her voice.“No, baby, I did what Rock would want me to do,” Drake muttered and pulled her tightly into his embrace. Carly didn’t have the energy to struggle. Drake realised she’d been running on adrenaline. Slowly, her head dropped, and when Drake was sure she was out, he motioned the doctor forward again. Drake gave the sleeping girl in his arms a kiss on her head.Drake’s heart had turned to stone when Ramirez had called and said Rock and Carly were both on their way to the hospital. Ramirez had said shit looked bad, but Carly was awake, albeit hysterical. Rock had taken two to the chest, and Drake’s gut clenched in pain. First Ace, then Gunner, and now Rock being shot. Rage was clean, and they were still taking bullets! Drake followed the doctors as they took Carly away and was stopped by the nurse as they arrived in the corridor leading to the operating theatre. Drake resolved to stay there until his brother and woman came out. It was going to be a long fuckin’ wait.◆◆◆ “Your girl’s gonna be mad,” Drake said to Rock many hours later. Rock opened his eyes and grunted. “I tricked Carly into getting treatment, and they sedated her,” Drake admitted, relieved to see colour in Rock’s face.“Ain’t gonna be happy,” Rock grunted.“Nah, but Carly was a mess, brother. That girl has ice in her veins until it comes to you. Broke my heart seeing Carly like that, sobbing, hysterical, frightened. Couldn’t let her suffer, and Carly needed help; she was shot too.” Rock’s eyes narrowed on Drake.“Carly’s in a room, and Blaze is with her. Carly took one to the shoulder and a graze in her hairline. I stayed with you, brother,” Drake said, resting his hand on Rock’s arm. Rock’s eyes closed, and Drake watched as his brother drew in even breaths. Relief hit as he realised everything was going to be fine. Rock and Carly were both safe, and both of them would heal.◆◆◆ “I want to sleep with him,” I demanded, as the nurse frowned at me in stern admonishment. Blaze hid a smile behind his hand as he realised I was going to be difficult.“Certainly not. This is a hospital, not a hotel,” the nurse snapped. I folded my arms.“Fine,” I said and glared. Drake had got Rock into the same room as me to recover, and I was itching to check Rock over myself. As soon as the nurse left, I threw the covers back. Blaze was at my side, knowing it was useless to stop me. Blaze helped me out of my bed and into Rocks. Instantly, I burrowed straight into Rock’s big body, patting him and checking he was whole.“Nurse will shit a brick,” Blaze warned me. I cocked open an eye, satisfied that Rock was intact, and shrugged. Ouch, that hurt. My arm was in a sling, and I’d an oversized bandage on my head. With a happy sigh, I closed my eyes and went to sleep with my good arm wrapped around Rock’s stomach.“She can’t sleep there!” an outraged voice hissed.“They’re both sleeping better for the other being there, so why not let them be?” Blaze retorted.“Because this is a hospital!” the angry nurse said indignantly. Ah, the same one as before.“And? They’re not exactly ripping up the sheets, are they? So what’s the big deal? You just said his stats are better, and clearly, Carly is helping him. Christ sake, have compassion, woman,” Blaze said irately.“Excuse me, I have compassion, but I refuse to let them sleep together. It’s enough they’re in the same room,” the nurse said.“Oh, shut up before you wake my woman. We ain’t harming anyone, and if you don’t like it, get lost. I refuse to let you check my woman and me,” Rock piped up angrily.“Now you’ve woken the patient!” the nurse snarled. Jeez, what a petty woman she was.“No, you woke us up with your negative angst. Go away; we refuse to let you touch us,” I said, refusing to open my eyes.“You can’t do that!” the nurse exclaimed.“Sure we can, you’re negative, mean, nasty, and clearly don’t care what’s best for your patient. Carly, being beside me is what’s best for me, so fuck off and take your shitty attitude elsewhere!” Rock said calmly for once.“Agreed,” I said, snuggling into Rock as he shifted in the bed to wrap an arm around me.“Blaze, let Doc Paul know we don’t want her; she’s vile,” I murmured, resting my head on Rock’s shoulder and drifting back off to sleep.I woke up feeling like I was being watched. Tiredly, I peeled open one eyelid and saw Rock’s brown eyes staring at me. His lips quirked in a small smile as he brushed my mane of hair out of my eyes.“Mornin’,” Rock murmured.“Hey,” I replied and worried about morning breath; I must be rank. Rock, however, smelt minty. I spied a pack of mints on the bedside table and snatched one, and shoved it into my mouth. That was better, no blasting Rock with yukky breath.“How you feeling?” Rock asked, his eyes raking me.“Okay, better now I know you’re okay. I’m so sorry,” I whispered. Shame crossed my face. Elrond and Chester had broken into our house and shot us. The insult was worse because it came after a fantastic night out after Bernard’s great food. It was just rude to shoot someone after eating at Bernard’s.“Don’t you ever apologise for those assholes. Fuck baby, you were born into that family; you didn’t ask for it. When I saw that gun aimed at you, my heart stopped. Thought I was going to lose everything,” Rock said, his voice shaky.“Me too. I can’t understand their mentality. Why come after us?” I asked.“Because my guess is they’ve never been told no. Those assholes, baby, they take, asking ain’t something they know how to do. Bettin’ your Dad raised them to be real class A assholes, and they bought into it. There was only one way their tragic nasty lives were going to end, Carly,” Rock said. I sighed because he wasn’t wrong. My father had ruined my brothers, taken anything decent out of them and killed it dead. Rock shifted on the bed and sat up.“Baby, I’m going for a shower and change, ain’t wearing this hospital gown. Blaze brought us loose clothing, so we ain’t gotta wear these,” Rock said, tugging at his gown and glaring. I was smirking when he shuffled out of bed and strode across to the private bathroom. Rock’s muscled ass teased me through the slit in the gown, and I bit back a grin. Yeah, Rock needed to dress. Once those randy nurses caught a load of that, there’d be trouble.◆◆◆ Doc Paul grinned as he read our charts and glanced at us on the bed. The nurse who’d been so mean earlier stood there with an expectant gaze. I held her eyes, wanting her to know there was no way I was leaving this bed. Doc Paul put the chart down, and his stance turned relaxed.“You’re both healing well, and there’re no complications. Carly, you can be discharged tomorrow and Rock in two days. But,” Doc Paul said, holding up his hand, “I imagine Carly won’t leave you. I’ll discharge you together in two days. You can tell Penny you can eat anything now. Neither of you is on a liquid diet,” Doc Paul said as the nurse’s face fell.“Penny been bugging you, Doc?” Rock asked.“Woman’s texted me ten times when she can bring proper food and not the slop we dish up,” Doc Paul grinned. The nurse made an outraged noise.“Penny’s stubborn,” Rock said.“And the food is awful here,” I agreed.“Well, I’m happy for now. Do not do anything to tear those stitches,” Doc Paul warned with a wicked glint in his eye.“Doctor, you seriously can’t mean for them to stay in the same bed?” the nurse said belligerently.“Nurse, who are they harming? They are in a private room, and if we try to dislodge one, they will both leave, which will be detrimental to their health. Plus, Phoenix made a rather large donation which I believe will be withdrawn should they be separated. For the sake of two days, suck it up and appreciate the fact they’re in love!” Doc Paul scolded, and a smug look crossed my face.◆◆◆ Several hours later, I was curled up dozing when there was a knock at the door. Rock twisted his head as the door opened, and his entire body tensed. I stared curiously at the man and woman who entered and hissed in a breath. The man was a pale version of Rock, at least thirty years older, but he’d definitely gone to seed. A jowly face and overhanging belly nearly hidden by the cut of his suit. This was Rock’s parents. Mitchell and Diana Johnson.“What do you want?” Rock growled, and I placed a hand on his arm. His entire body was strung like a wire.“Hello, son, we heard you had been shot,” the man said, his gaze sliding over me and a look of complete distaste crossing his face. If anything, Rock got even tenser.“What’s that to do with you?” Rock growled.“You’re our son,” Diana said.“Since when?” Rock shot back. He folded his arms across his chest and then thought better of it and dragged me under one holding me tightly against his side.“Heath!” Diana exclaimed, a pained expression crossing her face.“Name’s Rock,” he said with a dark look.“What stupid name is that?” Mitchell sneered, and I bristled. Mitchell’s gaze glanced at me again and dismissed me as unimportant.“The name my family gave me,” Rock replied and stared at them.“Those bikers you run around with? Honestly, Heath, you were raised better than that,” Mitchell said. Rock chuckled darkly.“You raised me to be an ass licking, yes, man. Didn’t sit well with me, so chose my own family,” Rock retorted.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell shot back, his shoulders squaring up and failing to look impressive.“Why don’t you tell me what you want and then get the hell back to ignoring my existence?” Rock drawled his eyes wary. I felt pain that they were treating Rock like this. Who did they think they were?“Son, we’ve kept tabs on you for a while,” Diana said gently but making it seem like she was offering Rock a gift.“And?” Rock grunted, not showing an ounce of leeway.“We’ve been impressed with your actions recently,” Mitchell said, and I bristled again.“Just recently?” I spat, unable to hold my tongue anymore.“And just who are you?” Diana asked icily.“Rock’s old lady,” I said, jerking my head at Rock. Diana’s lip curled in dislike, and she turned her gaze away from me. Dismissing me as beneath her worthiness. Rock tensed again under my hand. That was a mistake.“Well, your actions have proved you worthy. We want you to re-join the family,” Mitchell said. I hissed in a sharp breath. How dare they? Anger rose, but Rock’s arm squeezed me tightly.“Nah, I’m good, thanks, don’t need your poor excuse of a family,” Rock demurred.“You deny us?” Mitchell said in disbelief.“Why the fuck would you think I’d re-join your fucking family?” Rock thundered, and I jumped.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell thundered and took a visible intake of air. “You’ve proved yourself worthy, Heath. Your actions during the flood and now saving this… girl’s life were heroic. They would look great on my campaign.” My eyes nearly bugged from my head. Surely Mitchell couldn’t be serious?“Fuck you and fuck that bitch. Fuck your campaign too,” Rock said, pointing at his father and mother. “Over a decade ago, you threw me away because I wouldn’t fall into the life that you planned for me. Refused to accept I’d my own personality and desires for life. Denied me family because I wouldn’t sell my soul and kneel and obey at the feet of the great Mitchell Johnson.I was left out in the cold, and without my grandparents, I’d have had no family. Fuck you, Diana, you even cut them off because they didn’t fit in with your diamonds and Chanel. Seriously, how the fuck do you have the balls to walk into my life and tell me I’m good enough for you? You ain’t fuckin’ good enough for me!” Rock roared.“Heath…” Mitchell said, his face stern and angry.“Fuck Heath. Heath’s dead to you and has been since you kicked him out. Heath discovered a new family who accepted him and what he was. Why the hell do you think I need you in my life? I got along just fine without you, and I don’t fuckin’ need you now. And I tell ya now, any reporter seeks me out, I’ll let the damn world know how the great Mitchell Johnson treats family. Oh yeah, what a story that will make,” Rock snarled.“We’re leaving,” Mitchell growled.“Don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya,” Rock said and rolled on his side away from them. I tucked into his shoulder and heard the door slam. I was furious at how Rock’s parents had ambushed him.“You okay?” I asked.“Yeah, they don’t mean shit to me,” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my head.“That was upsetting,” I urged, hoping he’d open up and talk to me.“Nah, all Mitchell wanted to do was parade me around, bragging about his hero son. Mitchell’s right; it would have looked great on his campaign trail but fuck him. I’m not Mitchell’s puppet and haven’t been for years. I have far better things to do with my life, and dancing to his tune isn’t one of them. They threw me out and kicked me to the curb; they have no right to intrude on my life now,” Rock said firmly.I agreed wholeheartedly with him. My family was shit, total shit, and we were trailer trash rednecks. But Rock’s family hadn’t been poor like mine; they’d been well off and highly educated and not appreciated what a diamond they had. Instead, they abused and wholly misunderstood the wonderful son they had. Of course, that became a huge benefit to me. Rock and I would never have met if he’d stayed Heath Johnson.I rubbed my cheek on Rock’s chest and snuggled up. Rock lay there calmly as he assimilated what had just happened. I offered silent support as Rock chewed over the audacity of his parents, and then Rock snorted.“Fuck them, ain’t thinking about them no more. What we doing when we escape this joint?” Rock asked.“Whatever you want?” I said drowsily.“Oh yeah?” Rock teased. I slapped his firm stomach, and Rock chuckled.“Yeah.”“Want to plan a wedding?” Rock asked, and my drowsiness disappeared in the blink of an eye.“What?” I exclaimed, sitting up.“Marry me, I’ll give you a month to plan the wedding, but it has to be on Rage. Axel is conducting it, and don’t expect monkey suits or bullshit like that. But plan the wedding you want within reason,” Rock warned and mock scowled.“Wow, I’m overwhelmed by your proposal,” I said, my hand going to my heart. Rock scowled for real this time.“Ain’t a hearts and flowers guy Carly,” he warned. I sniggered; no, Rock most certainly wasn’t. But Rock was my guy, and I loved him.“So no getting on one knee?” I said, pretending to be serious.“What the fuck, Carly?” Rock growled, and I began giggling.“The look on your face!”“Woman, I’ll put you over my knee if you continue,” Rock threatened, and I broke into peals of laughter.“Is that meant to be a deterrent?” I gasped between chuckles.“Nope, a promise,” Rock said and tackled me to the bed. “Marry me.”“Yes,” I said and reached up to wrap my arms around his neck. Rock’s lips twitched into a smile of approval before he gave me his first kiss as his fiancée.◆◆◆ “Dum, dum dum, another one bites the dust,” Blaze sang, pointing at Rock. Rock launched a beer bottle at Blaze’s head, followed by an ashtray. I twisted my head, checked Rock was okay and sank back into a couch. I was listening to the old ladies plan the wedding and was heartily bored with the entire subject. Phoe was rambling about flowers, for which I arched an eyebrow at her.I’d already shot down a big white gown, limo, massive cake, and lord knows what else. All I wanted was a simple white dress, a small posy of flowers, cake, grill and Rock under an arch at the back of Rage. But making the old ladies understand that was freaking hard. I should have known better than to mention Rock had asked me to marry him.A shout made me jump, and I laughed as Rock took Blaze to the floor, wrestling. Drake snorted in amusement as Rock bounced Blaze’s head off the floor. Blaze heaved upwards, and Rock elbowed him in the belly. I rolled my eyes at Phoe, and we smiled. Blaze had been needling Rock ever since he’d found out Rock had asked me to marry him. I wasn’t sure if Blaze was acting as an irritating older brother (mine) or had finally just found a way to needle Rock. But Blaze had been a pain in Rock’s ass ever since we left the hospital. Blaze jammed an elbow into Rock’s thigh and punched him in the ribs, deliberately missing Rock’s wounds. Ace strode over and separated the wrestling men and promptly took a fist to the gut. He lifted an eye as Rock stared unabashedly back and hauled Blaze to his feet, shaking his head.“Fuckin’ children,” Ace muttered, and Axel howled with laughter. Rock smirked and strutted over to me; I imagined he thought he’d won that one.“How’s it going, baby?” Rock asked, dropping a light kiss on my lips. The old ladies stopped chatting and stared in rapt attention.“No one’s listening to me, so I give up. Can we run off to Vegas?” I bitched, and Rock’s eyes rolled.“Yeah, we can do,” Rock said, dropping another kiss on my lips. An outraged gasp sounded, and I knew Lindsey was glaring daggers at us.“Well, if they don’t listen, we can fly out this weekend,” Rock threatened, and further outraged gasps echoed. Rock winked, and I smiled against his mouth. He ran a finger down my face and knew his job was done. The old ladies would listen to me or miss out on our wedding.“Okay, what do you want?” Marsha sighed, and with a smile, I turned to face the thwarted women who were quietly fuming. Happily assured I’d be getting the wedding I wanted, I turned to Phoe and began speaking.◆◆◆ A knock surprised me as I wasn’t expecting anyone; I took the pots off the stove and turned off the gas. Strolling into the hallway, I opened the door and looked up and then again. A huge man stood in the doorway with white-blond hair and a scar running down his right cheek. A tattoo of black and red flames curled up his neck surrounding a dragon’s tail tattooed on his throat. Dark brown eyes stared at me coldly.“Carly?” his voice rumbled, and I stepped back, unsure.“Yes?” I spoke.“Don’t be afraid; I’m a friend. Need you to get a message to Drake, and I can’t go to the clubhouse because it’s being watched,” he said.“What? Who?” I stammered.“A friend Carly,” he insisted. I cocked my head and stared. A vague memory came to mind, Silvie describing someone.“You’re Ghost,” I said and stepped back, my hand searching for a weapon to defend myself.“No, I’m not a threat Carly. Rock isn’t being watched. I need Drake to receive a message. Warn him Taxman has taken over the Dark Souls of Lucifer. They have found somewhere to lie low, but I’m not aware where yet. Tell Drake I’m tracking them, and Blaze is a target. Carly, listen to me; Blaze must be protected, he’s on a hit list they have, and he’s right at the top,” Ghost said, and I stared. Ice flooded through my veins at the thought of Blaze in danger.“Why are you warning us? Because you hurt Silvie and betrayed Rage,” I hissed, my spine tingling in defence of Blaze.“No! I never ever hurt Silvie; I’d have given my life to prevent that. And I never betrayed Rage, Carly; I don’t fuckin’ care if you believe me or not. Just give Drake my warning,” Ghost insisted, his hands peacefully held by his side.“Oh, I’ll tell Drake alright, and Blaze, that you’ve put a target on his back,” I snapped.“For fuck’s sake, woman, I’m bringing a warning, don’t wanna see Rage get hurt. Blaze has a bigger target on his back than Drake does, which makes me think shit’s personal. Get Blaze to list his enemies and track them. Rage has excellent support, not that they need it, but Hawthorne will help. He’s tied to Rage tight now,” Ghost said patiently.“How does Drake contact you?” I asked.“He doesn’t. Drake can’t know shit about me other than this warning. Tell Drake to stop hunting me before he draws even more eyes,” Ghost warned, and a shiver ran down my spine again.“Bullshit,” I said. I was trying to keep Ghost talking. Rock should be home soon, and if I kept him here, Rock could handle him.“Know what you’re doing, Carly. Give Rock my warning to give to Drake,” Ghost said with a wry smile and strolled over to a bike and throttled it. He disappeared, and I cursed. Desperately, trying to keep everything Ghost said straight in my mind, I dashed back into the house and found a notepad and wrote down every word that Ghost had said. I was just finishing when pipes roared, and Rock pulled up outside our home.“Carly!” Rock called as he stomped towards me.“In here,” I called back, scribbling the last few words. Rock strolled in, and that flicker of desire flared between us. Idly I wondered if it would always be like that, a flame waiting to be stoked into a blaze.“How you doing, baby?” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my upturned face.“We had a visitor, Ghost. He came to give Drake a warning,” I said, and Rock’s face turned angry.“Say that again,” he demanded.“Ghost came here; he said he had a warning for Drake, Blaze and Rage. I’ve written it down word for word as best I could,” I said, motioning to the notepad. Rock’s face might as well have been carved from stone for all the emotion he showed. He picked up the pad and read it.“Good girl,” Rock said finally after reading it twice and dropped another kiss on my mouth before strolling away. I heard him on the phone, and then Rock returned.“Honey, Drake’s calling in the inner sanctum now. Can you turn off whatever you’re cooking and come and speak to Drake? This is too important to leave until the morning,” Rock asked gently. We spent around four nights a week at home, the other three at the clubhouse, and I cherished those nights at home. Rock was asking a lot for me to give up one of those precious nights.“Of course,” I said. There was no hesitation. This message was too important, and Drake clearly agreed.“Thank you, baby, I’ll order Bernard’s for you, get you ribs and fries delivered,” Rock bribed, and I laughed. He didn’t need to bribe me, but it was nice Rock thought about it.“With slaw and corn,” I grinned, and Rock slung an arm around my waist as he steered me outside to his bike.“And a huge double helping of Bernard’s chocolate orange sponge cake and custard.” Rock smiled. He mounted his bike, and I swung up behind him. Despite Rock smiling, he was as tense as fuck. Ghost had unsettled the status quo by coming to our home. Rock was unamused that I might have been in danger, and I could sense his brain turning matters over on how to ensure our safety here. The bike roared, and dust kicked up, and we sped off.◆◆◆ Two weeks later, we heard from child services. Luckily for us, we’d got a great social worker, and she’d been diligent at bringing Blake, Harrison, and Bonnie to us daily. Miss Winch’s investigations into Rock and I had finished, and we’d been waiting for her report. Rock and I had signed the paperwork to adopt them and were waiting to hear if child services and the court approved of us. Rock and I had attended court a week ago. Instead of giving an immediate decision, the judge had taken time to consider us as parents.I glanced at the window as a car pulled up and walked to the front door to see who’d arrived. My heart leapt into my mouth as Miss Winch got out, wearing a stern expression. Rock appeared behind me and placed his hands on my shoulders. Miss Winch opened the back door and leaned inside. When she stepped back, Bonnie tore towards us, yelling at the top of her lungs.A scream of joy left my lips as I dashed towards Bonnie and scooped her up. Bonnie babbled happily in her baby talk as Harrison followed behind and ran for Rock. Blake got out more cautiously and hesitated by Miss Winch.“The judge approved the adoption,” she said and broke into a smile.“Wonderful!” I exclaimed, hugging Bonnie tightly. Rock knelt down to Blake’s level.“Hey buddy, want to see your room?” Rock asked Blake.“Yeah,” Blake said a little sullenly.“Blake will adjust, give him time,” Miss Winch said, and I nodded.“Yeah, did you fulfil our other request?” I asked. When we’d gone to court, Rock and I had requested photos of the children and their parents. We intended to keep their parents alive for them. Miss Winch let out a beaming smile and then opened the trunk of her car. Inside were four boxes full of the children’s and their parents’ belongings. She lifted them out and put them on the ground.“This is what could be salvaged. It’s kind of you to honour their parents. Most would let their memories drop,” Miss Winch said.“We’re not most people, and their parents deserve to be remembered for their sacrifice. They should be remembered and honoured,” I replied, kissing Bonnie as she placed a smacker on my cheek.“Blake, Harrison and Bonnie are fortunate,” Miss Winch said and got back in her car.“Thank you,” I said, allowing emotion to leak into my voice.“No, thank you. Blake, Harrison and Bonnie will be thrilled. Their completed paperwork is in one of those boxes. Be lucky Carly,” Miss Winch said and pulled away.“Welcome home, honey,” I said, smiling at Bonnie, who grinned.“Carly!” Rock yelled as a boy’s laughter came from the house.“Oh dear, shall we go see what the menfolk are up to?” I asked Bonnie, who clapped her hands.",

      "content": "Chapter Ten.Drake heard Carly screaming before his ass had even cleared the doors. Animalistic howls and screeches echoed around the waiting room. Lindsey ran behind him, eyes wide with fear at the noise Carly was making. Drake rushed past a couple of nurses who were staring gobsmacked at a room and burst in, seeking Carly. Carly huddled near a corner covered in blood. Drake’s sharp eyes took in a wound on Carly’s shoulder, and a nurse and doctor were trying to get close. Lindsey crashed into his back and gasped. Carly was whiter than white, clearly injured and in shock.Her clothes were covered in blood, hers and Rocks, Drake guessed. Carly’s hands were held out in front of her, keeping the two medical staff away. She made little cries that were suddenly punctuated by a wild, loud one. Carly’s eyes were wild, and she kept glancing about, and she focused on Drake with laser intentness.“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed at Drake, lashing at him with pain in her voice.“Carly, baby,” Drake soothed, keeping his voice low pitched and calm.“No, no baby, they shot Rock, and then they took Rock!” Carly screamed, pointed at the doctor and nurse. Lindsey stepped out from behind, and Carly gazed at her.“Carly, come here,” Lindsey ordered gently. Carly shook her head and scuttled sideways, and backed herself straight into the corner. The door slammed open, and Lindsey was propelled into Drake’s side as Silvie burst through the door. Carly crouched low, her hands going over her head as she screamed. Silvie skidded to a halt and swapped a frightened gaze with Drake.“Carly, it’s me, it’s Silvie,” she soothed, trying to be heard over Carly’s cries. “Are you hurt, baby girl?”“They shot Rock!” Carly screamed, looking up at Drake. Terror flooded Carly’s face, and Drake swallowed hard.“Okay, but Rock’s in theatre now honey, you got him safe,” Silvie soothed, and Carly shook her head like a maniac.“No, I put Rock in danger. If not for my fucking family, Rock wouldn’t have been shot!” Carly cried, and tears tracked down her face. They made inroads in the dried blood on her face. Drake’s eyes narrowed, and he thought he saw a head wound. Damn, his girl wasn’t operating on all systems.“Carly, come to me,” Drake ordered, and Carly remained crouched, eying him suspiciously.“No, not until they get Rock,” she whispered malevolently, glaring at the doctor and nurse, who stood watching.“Honey, Rock’s having the bullets removed,” Silvie said gently.“They stole Rock from me,” Carly shrieked, and Lindsey winced. Drake was aware his brothers were outside, but no one entered. Carly was completely freaking out, and Drake understood why. She’d been shot in her shoulder and was favouring it. She looked to have other injuries, and she’d seen Rock gunned down trying to protect her. Taking a hard line wouldn’t work. Loudly shouting would make Carly freak even more and maybe even cause her to retaliate. Drake checked her over for signs of a weapon.“Carly, they’re fixing Rock up, baby. Now, why don’t you come here and let them fix you up?” Drake bartered. Carly cocked her head and then shook it firmly.“No!” she shouted. “Not until I know Rock’s okay. He’s gonna be okay, Drake, right? Rock will make it?” Carly’s begging broke Drake’s heart. He had to help her, help her through this and make Carly understand it wasn’t her fault. Drake knew she was blaming herself; the guilt was written across Carly’s face.“Rock will be just fine, baby,” Drake said softly.“I shot them in the head,” Carly spat, and her face turned evil and hateful. “I shot Elrond straight between the eyes and then Chester in the nuts. But Chester shot Rock again, and I shot him in the head. Bang, straight between Chester’s slitty eyes.” Drake felt pride rise in him. This girl, she was the miracle his brother had been waiting for. Carly was perfect for Rock, whether or not she realised it.“Rock would be proud, baby, that you defended yourself,” Drake said and stepped forward. Carly instantly moved to the side to avoid him. Her wild gaze was tearing him apart. Drake bled for the pain in her face and how Carly held her body defensively as if she expected Drake to hit her for endangering Rock. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, Drake just wanted to gather Carly up and soothe away her pain.“Rock will be fine, but he’ll want me to look after you,” Drake said, and Carly’s eyes latched onto his face, and Drake realised how to get Carly to obey. Damn him for using such a low trick, but if it got Carly, the help that she required, he’d do it.“Huh,” Carly said. Lindsey stepped forward, catching on quickly.“Rock won’t get better if he doesn’t know you’re looked after. Rock will want us to take care of you,” Lindsey baited. Silvie nodded in agreement.“Take care of me?” Carly dropped her gaze to her bloody hands.“Yeah, baby. Who is Rock’s Prez? His brother? Who would Rock trust to take care of you?” Drake said, stepping forward. Carly didn’t hunch back but stared at Drake.“You,” she whispered. Drake nodded and stepped closer, knowing he had her attention now.“Yeah, and if I don’t keep you safe, Carly, what will Rock do?” Drake asked.“Kick your ass,” Carly answered instantly, and her uninjured hand held the bullet wound at her shoulder.“Exactly.” Drake sat near her and waited for her to choose.“Rock would want this,” Carly muttered, and Drake nodded calmly.“Rock would. You being hurt will drive him insane,” Drake confirmed, and before the last word left his mouth, Carly scurried across the floor and launched into his lap. Drake wrapped arms around her and waved one hand at the doctor, who quietly came across and jabbed Carly with a needle. Carly stiffened in Drake’s arms, and her eyes blazed at him.“You betrayed me,” she said with wounded agony in her voice.“No, baby, I did what Rock would want me to do,” Drake muttered and pulled her tightly into his embrace. Carly didn’t have the energy to struggle. Drake realised she’d been running on adrenaline. Slowly, her head dropped, and when Drake was sure she was out, he motioned the doctor forward again. Drake gave the sleeping girl in his arms a kiss on her head.Drake’s heart had turned to stone when Ramirez had called and said Rock and Carly were both on their way to the hospital. Ramirez had said shit looked bad, but Carly was awake, albeit hysterical. Rock had taken two to the chest, and Drake’s gut clenched in pain. First Ace, then Gunner, and now Rock being shot. Rage was clean, and they were still taking bullets! Drake followed the doctors as they took Carly away and was stopped by the nurse as they arrived in the corridor leading to the operating theatre. Drake resolved to stay there until his brother and woman came out. It was going to be a long fuckin’ wait.◆◆◆ “Your girl’s gonna be mad,” Drake said to Rock many hours later. Rock opened his eyes and grunted. “I tricked Carly into getting treatment, and they sedated her,” Drake admitted, relieved to see colour in Rock’s face.“Ain’t gonna be happy,” Rock grunted.“Nah, but Carly was a mess, brother. That girl has ice in her veins until it comes to you. Broke my heart seeing Carly like that, sobbing, hysterical, frightened. Couldn’t let her suffer, and Carly needed help; she was shot too.” Rock’s eyes narrowed on Drake.“Carly’s in a room, and Blaze is with her. Carly took one to the shoulder and a graze in her hairline. I stayed with you, brother,” Drake said, resting his hand on Rock’s arm. Rock’s eyes closed, and Drake watched as his brother drew in even breaths. Relief hit as he realised everything was going to be fine. Rock and Carly were both safe, and both of them would heal.◆◆◆ “I want to sleep with him,” I demanded, as the nurse frowned at me in stern admonishment. Blaze hid a smile behind his hand as he realised I was going to be difficult.“Certainly not. This is a hospital, not a hotel,” the nurse snapped. I folded my arms.“Fine,” I said and glared. Drake had got Rock into the same room as me to recover, and I was itching to check Rock over myself. As soon as the nurse left, I threw the covers back. Blaze was at my side, knowing it was useless to stop me. Blaze helped me out of my bed and into Rocks. Instantly, I burrowed straight into Rock’s big body, patting him and checking he was whole.“Nurse will shit a brick,” Blaze warned me. I cocked open an eye, satisfied that Rock was intact, and shrugged. Ouch, that hurt. My arm was in a sling, and I’d an oversized bandage on my head. With a happy sigh, I closed my eyes and went to sleep with my good arm wrapped around Rock’s stomach.“She can’t sleep there!” an outraged voice hissed.“They’re both sleeping better for the other being there, so why not let them be?” Blaze retorted.“Because this is a hospital!” the angry nurse said indignantly. Ah, the same one as before.“And? They’re not exactly ripping up the sheets, are they? So what’s the big deal? You just said his stats are better, and clearly, Carly is helping him. Christ sake, have compassion, woman,” Blaze said irately.“Excuse me, I have compassion, but I refuse to let them sleep together. It’s enough they’re in the same room,” the nurse said.“Oh, shut up before you wake my woman. We ain’t harming anyone, and if you don’t like it, get lost. I refuse to let you check my woman and me,” Rock piped up angrily.“Now you’ve woken the patient!” the nurse snarled. Jeez, what a petty woman she was.“No, you woke us up with your negative angst. Go away; we refuse to let you touch us,” I said, refusing to open my eyes.“You can’t do that!” the nurse exclaimed.“Sure we can, you’re negative, mean, nasty, and clearly don’t care what’s best for your patient. Carly, being beside me is what’s best for me, so fuck off and take your shitty attitude elsewhere!” Rock said calmly for once.“Agreed,” I said, snuggling into Rock as he shifted in the bed to wrap an arm around me.“Blaze, let Doc Paul know we don’t want her; she’s vile,” I murmured, resting my head on Rock’s shoulder and drifting back off to sleep.I woke up feeling like I was being watched. Tiredly, I peeled open one eyelid and saw Rock’s brown eyes staring at me. His lips quirked in a small smile as he brushed my mane of hair out of my eyes.“Mornin’,” Rock murmured.“Hey,” I replied and worried about morning breath; I must be rank. Rock, however, smelt minty. I spied a pack of mints on the bedside table and snatched one, and shoved it into my mouth. That was better, no blasting Rock with yukky breath.“How you feeling?” Rock asked, his eyes raking me.“Okay, better now I know you’re okay. I’m so sorry,” I whispered. Shame crossed my face. Elrond and Chester had broken into our house and shot us. The insult was worse because it came after a fantastic night out after Bernard’s great food. It was just rude to shoot someone after eating at Bernard’s.“Don’t you ever apologise for those assholes. Fuck baby, you were born into that family; you didn’t ask for it. When I saw that gun aimed at you, my heart stopped. Thought I was going to lose everything,” Rock said, his voice shaky.“Me too. I can’t understand their mentality. Why come after us?” I asked.“Because my guess is they’ve never been told no. Those assholes, baby, they take, asking ain’t something they know how to do. Bettin’ your Dad raised them to be real class A assholes, and they bought into it. There was only one way their tragic nasty lives were going to end, Carly,” Rock said. I sighed because he wasn’t wrong. My father had ruined my brothers, taken anything decent out of them and killed it dead. Rock shifted on the bed and sat up.“Baby, I’m going for a shower and change, ain’t wearing this hospital gown. Blaze brought us loose clothing, so we ain’t gotta wear these,” Rock said, tugging at his gown and glaring. I was smirking when he shuffled out of bed and strode across to the private bathroom. Rock’s muscled ass teased me through the slit in the gown, and I bit back a grin. Yeah, Rock needed to dress. Once those randy nurses caught a load of that, there’d be trouble.◆◆◆ Doc Paul grinned as he read our charts and glanced at us on the bed. The nurse who’d been so mean earlier stood there with an expectant gaze. I held her eyes, wanting her to know there was no way I was leaving this bed. Doc Paul put the chart down, and his stance turned relaxed.“You’re both healing well, and there’re no complications. Carly, you can be discharged tomorrow and Rock in two days. But,” Doc Paul said, holding up his hand, “I imagine Carly won’t leave you. I’ll discharge you together in two days. You can tell Penny you can eat anything now. Neither of you is on a liquid diet,” Doc Paul said as the nurse’s face fell.“Penny been bugging you, Doc?” Rock asked.“Woman’s texted me ten times when she can bring proper food and not the slop we dish up,” Doc Paul grinned. The nurse made an outraged noise.“Penny’s stubborn,” Rock said.“And the food is awful here,” I agreed.“Well, I’m happy for now. Do not do anything to tear those stitches,” Doc Paul warned with a wicked glint in his eye.“Doctor, you seriously can’t mean for them to stay in the same bed?” the nurse said belligerently.“Nurse, who are they harming? They are in a private room, and if we try to dislodge one, they will both leave, which will be detrimental to their health. Plus, Phoenix made a rather large donation which I believe will be withdrawn should they be separated. For the sake of two days, suck it up and appreciate the fact they’re in love!” Doc Paul scolded, and a smug look crossed my face.◆◆◆ Several hours later, I was curled up dozing when there was a knock at the door. Rock twisted his head as the door opened, and his entire body tensed. I stared curiously at the man and woman who entered and hissed in a breath. The man was a pale version of Rock, at least thirty years older, but he’d definitely gone to seed. A jowly face and overhanging belly nearly hidden by the cut of his suit. This was Rock’s parents. Mitchell and Diana Johnson.“What do you want?” Rock growled, and I placed a hand on his arm. His entire body was strung like a wire.“Hello, son, we heard you had been shot,” the man said, his gaze sliding over me and a look of complete distaste crossing his face. If anything, Rock got even tenser.“What’s that to do with you?” Rock growled.“You’re our son,” Diana said.“Since when?” Rock shot back. He folded his arms across his chest and then thought better of it and dragged me under one holding me tightly against his side.“Heath!” Diana exclaimed, a pained expression crossing her face.“Name’s Rock,” he said with a dark look.“What stupid name is that?” Mitchell sneered, and I bristled. Mitchell’s gaze glanced at me again and dismissed me as unimportant.“The name my family gave me,” Rock replied and stared at them.“Those bikers you run around with? Honestly, Heath, you were raised better than that,” Mitchell said. Rock chuckled darkly.“You raised me to be an ass licking, yes, man. Didn’t sit well with me, so chose my own family,” Rock retorted.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell shot back, his shoulders squaring up and failing to look impressive.“Why don’t you tell me what you want and then get the hell back to ignoring my existence?” Rock drawled his eyes wary. I felt pain that they were treating Rock like this. Who did they think they were?“Son, we’ve kept tabs on you for a while,” Diana said gently but making it seem like she was offering Rock a gift.“And?” Rock grunted, not showing an ounce of leeway.“We’ve been impressed with your actions recently,” Mitchell said, and I bristled again.“Just recently?” I spat, unable to hold my tongue anymore.“And just who are you?” Diana asked icily.“Rock’s old lady,” I said, jerking my head at Rock. Diana’s lip curled in dislike, and she turned her gaze away from me. Dismissing me as beneath her worthiness. Rock tensed again under my hand. That was a mistake.“Well, your actions have proved you worthy. We want you to re-join the family,” Mitchell said. I hissed in a sharp breath. How dare they? Anger rose, but Rock’s arm squeezed me tightly.“Nah, I’m good, thanks, don’t need your poor excuse of a family,” Rock demurred.“You deny us?” Mitchell said in disbelief.“Why the fuck would you think I’d re-join your fucking family?” Rock thundered, and I jumped.“Watch your mouth,” Mitchell thundered and took a visible intake of air. “You’ve proved yourself worthy, Heath. Your actions during the flood and now saving this… girl’s life were heroic. They would look great on my campaign.” My eyes nearly bugged from my head. Surely Mitchell couldn’t be serious?“Fuck you and fuck that bitch. Fuck your campaign too,” Rock said, pointing at his father and mother. “Over a decade ago, you threw me away because I wouldn’t fall into the life that you planned for me. Refused to accept I’d my own personality and desires for life. Denied me family because I wouldn’t sell my soul and kneel and obey at the feet of the great Mitchell Johnson.I was left out in the cold, and without my grandparents, I’d have had no family. Fuck you, Diana, you even cut them off because they didn’t fit in with your diamonds and Chanel. Seriously, how the fuck do you have the balls to walk into my life and tell me I’m good enough for you? You ain’t fuckin’ good enough for me!” Rock roared.“Heath…” Mitchell said, his face stern and angry.“Fuck Heath. Heath’s dead to you and has been since you kicked him out. Heath discovered a new family who accepted him and what he was. Why the hell do you think I need you in my life? I got along just fine without you, and I don’t fuckin’ need you now. And I tell ya now, any reporter seeks me out, I’ll let the damn world know how the great Mitchell Johnson treats family. Oh yeah, what a story that will make,” Rock snarled.“We’re leaving,” Mitchell growled.“Don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya,” Rock said and rolled on his side away from them. I tucked into his shoulder and heard the door slam. I was furious at how Rock’s parents had ambushed him.“You okay?” I asked.“Yeah, they don’t mean shit to me,” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my head.“That was upsetting,” I urged, hoping he’d open up and talk to me.“Nah, all Mitchell wanted to do was parade me around, bragging about his hero son. Mitchell’s right; it would have looked great on his campaign trail but fuck him. I’m not Mitchell’s puppet and haven’t been for years. I have far better things to do with my life, and dancing to his tune isn’t one of them. They threw me out and kicked me to the curb; they have no right to intrude on my life now,” Rock said firmly.I agreed wholeheartedly with him. My family was shit, total shit, and we were trailer trash rednecks. But Rock’s family hadn’t been poor like mine; they’d been well off and highly educated and not appreciated what a diamond they had. Instead, they abused and wholly misunderstood the wonderful son they had. Of course, that became a huge benefit to me. Rock and I would never have met if he’d stayed Heath Johnson.I rubbed my cheek on Rock’s chest and snuggled up. Rock lay there calmly as he assimilated what had just happened. I offered silent support as Rock chewed over the audacity of his parents, and then Rock snorted.“Fuck them, ain’t thinking about them no more. What we doing when we escape this joint?” Rock asked.“Whatever you want?” I said drowsily.“Oh yeah?” Rock teased. I slapped his firm stomach, and Rock chuckled.“Yeah.”“Want to plan a wedding?” Rock asked, and my drowsiness disappeared in the blink of an eye.“What?” I exclaimed, sitting up.“Marry me, I’ll give you a month to plan the wedding, but it has to be on Rage. Axel is conducting it, and don’t expect monkey suits or bullshit like that. But plan the wedding you want within reason,” Rock warned and mock scowled.“Wow, I’m overwhelmed by your proposal,” I said, my hand going to my heart. Rock scowled for real this time.“Ain’t a hearts and flowers guy Carly,” he warned. I sniggered; no, Rock most certainly wasn’t. But Rock was my guy, and I loved him.“So no getting on one knee?” I said, pretending to be serious.“What the fuck, Carly?” Rock growled, and I began giggling.“The look on your face!”“Woman, I’ll put you over my knee if you continue,” Rock threatened, and I broke into peals of laughter.“Is that meant to be a deterrent?” I gasped between chuckles.“Nope, a promise,” Rock said and tackled me to the bed. “Marry me.”“Yes,” I said and reached up to wrap my arms around his neck. Rock’s lips twitched into a smile of approval before he gave me his first kiss as his fiancée.◆◆◆ “Dum, dum dum, another one bites the dust,” Blaze sang, pointing at Rock. Rock launched a beer bottle at Blaze’s head, followed by an ashtray. I twisted my head, checked Rock was okay and sank back into a couch. I was listening to the old ladies plan the wedding and was heartily bored with the entire subject. Phoe was rambling about flowers, for which I arched an eyebrow at her.I’d already shot down a big white gown, limo, massive cake, and lord knows what else. All I wanted was a simple white dress, a small posy of flowers, cake, grill and Rock under an arch at the back of Rage. But making the old ladies understand that was freaking hard. I should have known better than to mention Rock had asked me to marry him.A shout made me jump, and I laughed as Rock took Blaze to the floor, wrestling. Drake snorted in amusement as Rock bounced Blaze’s head off the floor. Blaze heaved upwards, and Rock elbowed him in the belly. I rolled my eyes at Phoe, and we smiled. Blaze had been needling Rock ever since he’d found out Rock had asked me to marry him. I wasn’t sure if Blaze was acting as an irritating older brother (mine) or had finally just found a way to needle Rock. But Blaze had been a pain in Rock’s ass ever since we left the hospital. Blaze jammed an elbow into Rock’s thigh and punched him in the ribs, deliberately missing Rock’s wounds. Ace strode over and separated the wrestling men and promptly took a fist to the gut. He lifted an eye as Rock stared unabashedly back and hauled Blaze to his feet, shaking his head.“Fuckin’ children,” Ace muttered, and Axel howled with laughter. Rock smirked and strutted over to me; I imagined he thought he’d won that one.“How’s it going, baby?” Rock asked, dropping a light kiss on my lips. The old ladies stopped chatting and stared in rapt attention.“No one’s listening to me, so I give up. Can we run off to Vegas?” I bitched, and Rock’s eyes rolled.“Yeah, we can do,” Rock said, dropping another kiss on my lips. An outraged gasp sounded, and I knew Lindsey was glaring daggers at us.“Well, if they don’t listen, we can fly out this weekend,” Rock threatened, and further outraged gasps echoed. Rock winked, and I smiled against his mouth. He ran a finger down my face and knew his job was done. The old ladies would listen to me or miss out on our wedding.“Okay, what do you want?” Marsha sighed, and with a smile, I turned to face the thwarted women who were quietly fuming. Happily assured I’d be getting the wedding I wanted, I turned to Phoe and began speaking.◆◆◆ A knock surprised me as I wasn’t expecting anyone; I took the pots off the stove and turned off the gas. Strolling into the hallway, I opened the door and looked up and then again. A huge man stood in the doorway with white-blond hair and a scar running down his right cheek. A tattoo of black and red flames curled up his neck surrounding a dragon’s tail tattooed on his throat. Dark brown eyes stared at me coldly.“Carly?” his voice rumbled, and I stepped back, unsure.“Yes?” I spoke.“Don’t be afraid; I’m a friend. Need you to get a message to Drake, and I can’t go to the clubhouse because it’s being watched,” he said.“What? Who?” I stammered.“A friend Carly,” he insisted. I cocked my head and stared. A vague memory came to mind, Silvie describing someone.“You’re Ghost,” I said and stepped back, my hand searching for a weapon to defend myself.“No, I’m not a threat Carly. Rock isn’t being watched. I need Drake to receive a message. Warn him Taxman has taken over the Dark Souls of Lucifer. They have found somewhere to lie low, but I’m not aware where yet. Tell Drake I’m tracking them, and Blaze is a target. Carly, listen to me; Blaze must be protected, he’s on a hit list they have, and he’s right at the top,” Ghost said, and I stared. Ice flooded through my veins at the thought of Blaze in danger.“Why are you warning us? Because you hurt Silvie and betrayed Rage,” I hissed, my spine tingling in defence of Blaze.“No! I never ever hurt Silvie; I’d have given my life to prevent that. And I never betrayed Rage, Carly; I don’t fuckin’ care if you believe me or not. Just give Drake my warning,” Ghost insisted, his hands peacefully held by his side.“Oh, I’ll tell Drake alright, and Blaze, that you’ve put a target on his back,” I snapped.“For fuck’s sake, woman, I’m bringing a warning, don’t wanna see Rage get hurt. Blaze has a bigger target on his back than Drake does, which makes me think shit’s personal. Get Blaze to list his enemies and track them. Rage has excellent support, not that they need it, but Hawthorne will help. He’s tied to Rage tight now,” Ghost said patiently.“How does Drake contact you?” I asked.“He doesn’t. Drake can’t know shit about me other than this warning. Tell Drake to stop hunting me before he draws even more eyes,” Ghost warned, and a shiver ran down my spine again.“Bullshit,” I said. I was trying to keep Ghost talking. Rock should be home soon, and if I kept him here, Rock could handle him.“Know what you’re doing, Carly. Give Rock my warning to give to Drake,” Ghost said with a wry smile and strolled over to a bike and throttled it. He disappeared, and I cursed. Desperately, trying to keep everything Ghost said straight in my mind, I dashed back into the house and found a notepad and wrote down every word that Ghost had said. I was just finishing when pipes roared, and Rock pulled up outside our home.“Carly!” Rock called as he stomped towards me.“In here,” I called back, scribbling the last few words. Rock strolled in, and that flicker of desire flared between us. Idly I wondered if it would always be like that, a flame waiting to be stoked into a blaze.“How you doing, baby?” Rock said, dropping a kiss on my upturned face.“We had a visitor, Ghost. He came to give Drake a warning,” I said, and Rock’s face turned angry.“Say that again,” he demanded.“Ghost came here; he said he had a warning for Drake, Blaze and Rage. I’ve written it down word for word as best I could,” I said, motioning to the notepad. Rock’s face might as well have been carved from stone for all the emotion he showed. He picked up the pad and read it.“Good girl,” Rock said finally after reading it twice and dropped another kiss on my mouth before strolling away. I heard him on the phone, and then Rock returned.“Honey, Drake’s calling in the inner sanctum now. Can you turn off whatever you’re cooking and come and speak to Drake? This is too important to leave until the morning,” Rock asked gently. We spent around four nights a week at home, the other three at the clubhouse, and I cherished those nights at home. Rock was asking a lot for me to give up one of those precious nights.“Of course,” I said. There was no hesitation. This message was too important, and Drake clearly agreed.“Thank you, baby, I’ll order Bernard’s for you, get you ribs and fries delivered,” Rock bribed, and I laughed. He didn’t need to bribe me, but it was nice Rock thought about it.“With slaw and corn,” I grinned, and Rock slung an arm around my waist as he steered me outside to his bike.“And a huge double helping of Bernard’s chocolate orange sponge cake and custard.” Rock smiled. He mounted his bike, and I swung up behind him. Despite Rock smiling, he was as tense as fuck. Ghost had unsettled the status quo by coming to our home. Rock was unamused that I might have been in danger, and I could sense his brain turning matters over on how to ensure our safety here. The bike roared, and dust kicked up, and we sped off.◆◆◆ Two weeks later, we heard from child services. Luckily for us, we’d got a great social worker, and she’d been diligent at bringing Blake, Harrison, and Bonnie to us daily. Miss Winch’s investigations into Rock and I had finished, and we’d been waiting for her report. Rock and I had signed the paperwork to adopt them and were waiting to hear if child services and the court approved of us. Rock and I had attended court a week ago. Instead of giving an immediate decision, the judge had taken time to consider us as parents.I glanced at the window as a car pulled up and walked to the front door to see who’d arrived. My heart leapt into my mouth as Miss Winch got out, wearing a stern expression. Rock appeared behind me and placed his hands on my shoulders. Miss Winch opened the back door and leaned inside. When she stepped back, Bonnie tore towards us, yelling at the top of her lungs.A scream of joy left my lips as I dashed towards Bonnie and scooped her up. Bonnie babbled happily in her baby talk as Harrison followed behind and ran for Rock. Blake got out more cautiously and hesitated by Miss Winch.“The judge approved the adoption,” she said and broke into a smile.“Wonderful!” I exclaimed, hugging Bonnie tightly. Rock knelt down to Blake’s level.“Hey buddy, want to see your room?” Rock asked Blake.“Yeah,” Blake said a little sullenly.“Blake will adjust, give him time,” Miss Winch said, and I nodded.“Yeah, did you fulfil our other request?” I asked. When we’d gone to court, Rock and I had requested photos of the children and their parents. We intended to keep their parents alive for them. Miss Winch let out a beaming smile and then opened the trunk of her car. Inside were four boxes full of the children’s and their parents’ belongings. She lifted them out and put them on the ground.“This is what could be salvaged. It’s kind of you to honour their parents. Most would let their memories drop,” Miss Winch said.“We’re not most people, and their parents deserve to be remembered for their sacrifice. They should be remembered and honoured,” I replied, kissing Bonnie as she placed a smacker on my cheek.“Blake, Harrison and Bonnie are fortunate,” Miss Winch said and got back in her car.“Thank you,” I said, allowing emotion to leak into my voice.“No, thank you. Blake, Harrison and Bonnie will be thrilled. Their completed paperwork is in one of those boxes. Be lucky Carly,” Miss Winch said and pulled away.“Welcome home, honey,” I said, smiling at Bonnie, who grinned.“Carly!” Rock yelled as a boy’s laughter came from the house.“Oh dear, shall we go see what the menfolk are up to?” I asked Bonnie, who clapped her hands.",

Carly had told her story twice and answered questions, and then gone to eat the feast Rock had ordered for her. Rage was still no closer to discovering what game Ghost was playing. Nor were they close to finding where he was bunking down.“I want a list of everyone you have crossed, small or big, imagined or real,” Drake said, pointing at Blaze, who had been asked to attend the meeting. Gunner sat tense with Apache next to him. Drake’s eyes studied Apache, wondering how the man was doing. Ghost and Apache had been closer than blood at one point. Blaze nodded.“Whoever is watching you is the one with the grudge,” Ace said, and Blaze gave a chin lift. No denying that.“Gunner, up security, aim cameras at the street. Ain’t gonna mess with this warning. Whatever fuckin’ game Ghost is playing, we’ll be on guard,” Drake said.“He came to my home, Drake,” Rock snarled. He glanced around at the inner circle and Blaze. Axel met his eyes head-on. Texas was contemplating something which had the big man frowning. Fish followed Rock’s gaze.“What, Texas?” Fish asked.“Ghost was never one to play games. Was always a straight shooter, so why the cloak and daggers?” Texas mused.“You thinkin’ he’s into something, and he’s so deep in shit he can’t get out?” Apache asked, leaning forward.“Dunno, just saying, it ain’t like Ghost to play stupid games. We ain’t got enough to say what the bastard’s up to,” Texas replied.“Ghost often hid in the background, taking shit in and assimilating it before acting. The man was a planner and insightful. You thinkin’ he ain’t betrayed Rage?” Apache pushed.“Brother, I can’t say. His going to Rock’s home means he didn’t want to be seen or caught. So he’s either covering or hiding from someone. If Silvie hadn’t had seen him, I don’t think the man would have broken whatever cover he’s hiding behind,” Texas replied.“Ghost took Drake’s side. Man was firmly entrenched in getting Rage clean, so none of this bullshit makes sense,” Axel boomed, and Gunner looked up.“Was he though, or was he playin’ us all?”“Dunno. But we got his warning. Blaze, this gonna suck for you, but I don’t want you alone. Want you on Rage whenever possible and no riding alone. You’re not to be at the gym alone, get Hunter to open, and we can have a candidate close it. But no going there without backup,” Ace warned Blaze.“We can’t keep that up long term,” Blaze said.“No, we can’t, so we gotta track down what Ghost is doing with Dark Souls of Lucifer. Those assholes are the common link. Track them, and we may crack open more leads,” Gunner said.“We got a plan, so let’s move it,” Drake said and slammed the table with his gravel.◆◆◆ “You think Rage will listen?” a voice asked Ghost as he stood staring at the Black Hills. Ghost turned to the man. Their meeting had been concluded, but the other guy was still here.“I sent a warning, can’t do shit else,” Ghost said.“Rage are stubborn assholes, if we brought them into this….”“I said no!” Ghost thundered, his temper lighting. “Rage are off-limits. You got me, that’s enough. Touch Rage, and I’ll burn the city down, you hear me? The brothers, candidates, prospects, old ladies and kids, all protected by our agreement. Break that dude, and you’ll never stop looking over your shoulder. I was Rage’s soldier. Never forget that,” Ghost warned.“Just saying…”“Don’t fuckin’ just say. Do your job, and I’ll do mine,” Ghost warned and turned his back. His eyes swept the landscape, looking for danger, any trace he’d been followed. There was none. He wasn’t called Ghost for no reason. One day, Ghost promised, one day soon, this would end.",
