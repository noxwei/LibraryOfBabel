      "content": "1 – AYDAPulling her cloak closer around her neck she crept forward through the cold night. Her breath fogged in a miniature cloud around her. Careful not to disturb the silence, steadily, she tiptoed through the forest avoiding fallen leaves and branches. Not far behind, a short figure was mimicking her every step, following her trail to stay silent through the trees. The first figure raised her hand and signalled for a stop before crouching behind the closest tree, slowly and carefully the second figure joined her.‘Can you see that?’ She whispered to her comrade, pointing towards several faint flickeringlights in the distance.‘Yes. Ayda, I really think we should go back,’ Jonas' voice was shaking, from coldnervousness she couldn't tell.‘We've come too far! We're almost there!’ Ayda's childish enthusiasm was clear, she wasmoving forwards. They had travelled through the night, leaving the safety of the Stone Castle to cross the Myr River and venture into the dangerous unknown. The forest thinned as they approached the settlement ahead. Slowly, they moved forward, keeping low to avoid being spotted. Several wooden buildings came into view as they moved closer towards the town. A dirt path led through Oakwood Town, lined with dim, flickering streetlights and small wooden log homes and stores. Ayda smiled, the lighting through the village was so faint, it would be easy for them to sneak in and out without being seen. Their path was clear, a quick study revealed that no guards seemed to be on patrol. Running slightly, they followed the path into the village and stopped in the nearest alleyway between the first row of buildings. Neither of them spoke. Catching their breath, their eyes darted each way, taking in the surroundings, ears straining to pick up the slightest sounds. In the distance, a couple of hissing cats were threatening each other over scraps of food, muffled laughter and singing could be heard coming from a lit wooden building several streets away from their hiding spot.‘Everything here is wood,’ Jonas whispered in her ear. Their own people, the Elves, hadlittle use for wooden buildings. A nearby mountain range meant their own homes in the city were made of white stone, even storehouses and stables were made of stone. Children were never allowed out of the Stone City. Ayda rolled her eyes. Jonas had been her best friend since they were very young children, but he never paid any attention in their lessons, and as they approached their teenage years, he was quickly distancing himself from others their age.‘So, now we're in the village, what did you want to see?’ He grinned, clearly his enthusiasm had kicked in the closer they became, despite his previous warnings.‘The Humans,’ Ayda replied simply, ‘My Mother wants me to start my real lessons soon, so I think it's best I see first-hand what we are up against.’ Jonas nodded, he understood what Ayda meant by real lessons. Ayda was a Princess of Myrliar, and as the eldest, was next in line to the throne. This meant that, in time, she would be responsible for protecting her people from the Humans and their bloody history.‘I can't wait for you to be Queen.’ Jonas said gazing into the distance. Ayda looked at Jonas fondly. She knew the reason Jonas paid little attention in lessons; his mind was on Guard Training. It was his dearest wish to become her Protector, and she would trust no-one else when it came to be offering the position. She shook her head, bringing herself back to the present, they had many years before then and she had to concentrate. It was dangerous wandering into human territory, that much she did know. Elves and Humans had been at war for centuries, but she had only read about it in books, and had never seen Humans with her own eyes. Nearby, a loud crash pierced through the silence as a bin was overturned, followed by the barks of several dogs angry at being woken. Ayda and Jonas retreated a few steps as a man stumbled into the alleyway. Instantly, Jonas stepped between the man and Ayda. Jonas held his breath, not sure what to do. Ayda cursed for letting their guard down. Leaning against the wooden log wall, the man looked at the two with unfocussed eyes before taking a large swig from the flask at his waist.‘Oo' you then?’ He blubbered suspiciously, ‘I've not seen you round ere' before?’He stumbled a few steps closer to them, as he leant on the wall. He smelled strongly of ale, his breathing was heavy, and he looked as though he was struggling to keep himself upright. He continued to stare at them, narrowing his eyes as he took a few more sips of his flask. Then suddenly, his eyes rounded as recognition dawned.‘You only kids! You should be abed! Where’s ya mommy?’ He cooed, hiccoughing between breaths. His eyes closed, and he slid down the wall, landed face first in the dirt and fell asleep snoring. Jonas relaxed, and turned to face Ayda,‘Do you think all humans are like that?’ Ayda giggled nervously, relieved that their cloaks had hidden their identity. Jonas gestured that they should leave the alley, someone was bound to come and check on him after the noise he made. Peering around the building, they checked that their way was clear before moving further into the town. Ayda followed the sound of laughter, she was planning to watch these people from a distance, getting too close would mean certain death. Checking that her hood still concealed her, she quickened her steps. Left, then right, then right again, she counted, making sure she remembered the way out. The streets were mostly empty, many people were asleep she guessed. One or two people clumsily made their way through the dirty streets, paying Ayda and Jonas no attention. Finally, they found the noisy building. Cautiously keeping their distance, Ayda watched through the glass window. A jolly band of men were playing the fiddle and singing, whilst men and women danced, bouncing through the room in glee, swinging each other round and round and laughing when they tripped or fell. Others were standing around leaning on walls or sitting at tables, clapping with the music or roaring at something a friend had said. The atmosphere was alive, Ayda felt a smile creep onto her face. These people were carefree and good natured she thought. How can people this happy be capable of such evil? She glanced at Jonas and was surprised to see his head bobbing along to the music, he too wore a grin on his face as he watched the partygoers enjoy themselves through the window. Staying hidden in the shadows, they watched, immersed for many long minutes, allowing the happiness to warm them on the cold night. Ayda could not understand. Through her lessons she had studied human history, ancient books telling stories of bloodshed, hatred and war, the people in front of her, celebrating life, could not possibly be her enemy. Time crept by secretly, as she watched, fascinated.‘Come on, I think we've seen enough, I'm going to get a royal beating when the King and Queen realise you've been out all night.’ Jonas nudged her after a while. Ayda heard him, but she could not tear herself away from the sight, the dancers had dwindled in numbers and people were tiring. Any minute now people would start to leave the party. Jonas grabbed her hand and pulled her away roughly back down the street, just as the door slammed open releasing laughter and drunken voices into the night. Hastily he led her through the twists and turns of the alleys that he remembered, when suddenly he stopped and roughly threw her down a side alley and pushed her down.‘What the –’ Ayda started, but Jonas smothered the sound with a hand to her mouth. Shaking his head at her, she was alarmed to see the panic in his eyes.‘Guards.\" He mouthed, keeping low behind the cluster of bins he hid them behind. Listening, Ayda heard the crunching of heavy boots on dirt approaching, and the clink of metal on metal, they were armed she guessed. Breathing as quietly as possible, they waited for the sounds to fade away as the Guards moved their patrol on. ‘I'm going to check the way, if you get caught, my life won't be worth living.’ Jonas stated. Ayda began to protest but the serious look in his eye silenced her as he moved away. He blamed her. Why had she let her curiosity get to her? Despite his anger at her decision, poor Jonas had felt the need to follow her here to keep her safe and if it wasn't for him, she would likely be a prisoner already – if not dead. What would she do if he got into trouble? He had begged her not to go, had explained that it was too dangerous, but she had gone on. Guiltily, she started to draw in the dirt with her finger, occupying her guilty thoughts and thinking of an apology ready for the moment he arrived to guide her home. Long minutes passed. The town was eerie, no sound came to her. The music and laughter had died out, as had the clumsy scuffles of humans returning home. Where was he? Ayda was sure she remembered the way, she could meet him at the forest, he hadn't said to wait for her after all, maybe he had meant for her to follow at a distance? She sighed and left the safety of her hiding place. Following the path carefully, she double checked each crossing and each shadow before moving, and eventually reached the forest with no encounters. He was not there. Panic started to rise within her. No. He had not been taken. He was lost, she hoped. She would have heard if he had got into trouble, they hadn't ventured that deep into the town. Ayda waited, scanning the town for any signs of him. There were none. There was no movement at all. No cats screeching, no dogs, no humans. The village was deserted, all that remained was the faint flickering of lights and the crisp, cold air. Ayda cursed, she had to go back - she couldn't leave without him. Ayda ran back to the village, confident of the emptiness she had observed, she sped through alleys and round corners, desperately listening for him.Resisting the urge to call out his name, she stopped. Breathing heavily with panic rising in her chest, she spun around desperately. In the corner of her eye she had glimpsed movement, edging closer, her stomach dropped as she saw three armed men hauling a heavy something down an alley not far from her. Guards she thought. Pressing up against the wall, she followed them, hoping to hear anything that would help her find Jonas. As she got closer, she noticed with sickness, that whatever they were carrying had arms. And legs.‘Jonas!’ She screamed, forgetting her silence, terror clutching at her heart. The guards spun around and dropped the lifeless body on the ground. She stared, willing the boy to move, to breathe, to do something, but he didn't. His eyes were closed, and scarlet blood was trickling down his face.‘Grab her!’ A Guard shouted. She ran, tears streaming from her eyes, blinding her. Feeling her way back through the alleys, her hands became rough and splintered along the wooden walls, hoping beyond hope that Jonas was not dead, just unconscious. She heard him, his pounding footsteps were close, too close. She veered left, losing all sense of direction through her hindered sight and manic thoughts. Ayda gasped as her foot caught and she tripped, falling, falling into the dirt, smashing down hard into the ground, she felt her knife press against her thigh under her cloak.‘Stop running girl-elf,’ The guard was right above her, his snarl was rough had harsh. She had nowhere to go. Pushing herself up off the floor, Ayda spun around to face him. He was much older, and he was large. She could tell he was too strong to outrun and she could never fight him off, but maybe she could buy some time. He reached out and grabbed hold of her wrist. Instinctively she grabbed her hunting knife and sank it deep into his outstretched arm, he screamed out and clutched at his bloody arm as she sprinted further and further away. Running blindly, Ayda realised too late, meant she was now utterly lost. Finding herself at a dead end, she cursed, there was nowhere left to run. The guard was yelling as he drew closer. Any minute now he would find her, trapped and vulnerable.‘Hey! Get down here!’ Someone hissed at her as they poked their head out of a grate in the ground. She looked down and saw a boy, slightly older than her, frantically beckoning at her to follow him down. Without a second thought she squeezed through the small gap in the dirt sodden ground and felt her boots hit shallow water. The boy disappeared momentarily as he replaced the grate as silently as he could. Catching her breath, her eyes adjusted to the darkness that pressed in all around her, she heard the thundering echo of the guards' boots fade away.‘T-Thank you.’ She stammered, breathlessly. Reaching out to find a slimy wall, she pressed her sweaty face against the cool surface as she recovered.‘No problem. My Pa sent me to get you.’ He was watching her closely. Unnerved, she realised her hood was down, she hastily rushed to pull it back over.‘Too late girl-elf. We all know what you are.’ He smiled at her.‘Why did you help me?’ She asked, regaining her breath. The boy shrugged then gestured for her to follow. Ayda glanced up at the grate, she could escape now that the guard was gone, she needed to find Jonas.‘They are watching all exits out of the town, you will not escape unnoticed. But, feel free to leave for all I care.’ He stared at her hard, then started walking. Ayda shook her head knowing he was right, she had no chance of saving Jonas alone. Following him she took in her surroundings, by the looks of it they were in the sewers. Water was lapping at her ankles and soaking through her boots, but she trudged on, tense, wondering where this boy was leading her. The only light they had to guide them was a small candle the boy was holding, he obviously knew his way around well. They walked in silence for what felt like an hour before Ayda worked up the courage to speak to her saviour.‘Where are we going?’ Ayda asked nervously, she did not know how much she could trust this stranger.‘To my Pa.’ He replied. It hit Ayda that this could easily be a trap, yet, if it was, he could have just left her to the guard back at the dead end. No. She had to follow this boy. She had no other choice, he may know where Jonas was, and be able to help him.‘Will you help me get my friend? Do you know where he is?’ She asked desperately. The boy did not reply. He stopped and climbed up a tiny hidden ladder. Ayda noticed a wooden door above him, he pounded on it a couple of times before it creaked open. A rough hand took the boy by the arm and lifted him through the gap. Ayda followed cautiously, her foot slipping on the wet ladder. Light flooded her vision as she was heaved up through the space, steadying her balance, she found herself in a small cold room. The small wooden door in the floor was closed behind her.‘Sit,’ A man's voice filled the room. She sat at the lone table and chair next to the young boy.‘Well done Niall. Nice to see one of em' is in one piece.’ He patted the young boy on the back. Niall grinned, clearly proud of his daring rescue. Niall was a couple of years older than Ayda, but small for his age and thin. His dark eyes and dark hair contrasted with his milky white skin. The older man looked tough, he wore dirty clothes, several sizes larger than necessary and his long messy hair was greying in places. He had strong arms and work hardened hands, a worker, Ayda guessed.‘T-Thank you Sir, for your help,’ Ayda stammered her thanks to the older man.‘I don't know why you're here kid, but you should have known better. We don't want your kind here.’ The man said roughly, sitting opposite her at the table. Ayda nodded and looked down at her hands. There was blood on them she noticed, the guard’s blood, she checked her knife belt and felt the blade safely where it should be. ‘We need to get you out of here, girl.’ The man instructed, gruffly.‘Ayda,’ She looked up at him, ‘My name is Ayda. I'm no girl.’ The man chuckled to himself, patted his son on the back and rose to his feet.‘Right then Ayda. If you are no girl, maybe I should kill you right here and now?’ He said staring her down. ‘I don’t like your lot. But I won’t see harm come to a kid.’ Ayda nodded and looked down at her trembling hands again. She had to get to Jonas, she didn't have time for this. She felt tears in her eyes as she thought of her friend only coming along to protect her, and now she had gotten them both into so much trouble.‘I need to get my friend and then we can go home.’ She said quietly.‘No. You need to leave. Now.’ The man said impatiently, pressing a flagon of water into her hands.‘I can't just leave him here!’ Ayda replied firmly, anger rising at the idea of leaving Jonas.‘Niall will take you safely back to the bridge. You will retrieve your horse, ride home and never return.’ Ayda's frustration was boiling, she was not going to leave Jonas here at the mercy of the humans. She could not leave him.‘Why didn't you help him?’ She demanded impatiently, shaking with growing anger. Niall's father placed his hand to his face and rubbed his temple. He looked at her as his gaze softened slightly. Ayda regretted this last question. This man clearly loved his son and had done what he could to help her purely because she was a child. It was obvious he detested 'her kind' and yet out of respect for the love of a Father he had saved her.‘I sent Niall to help you because he is still small enough to fit through all the tunnel exits. We did not realise that there were two of you until it was too late.’ The man explained.‘Well we can go back to Jonas, now can't we?’ Ayda asked despairingly.‘No,’ Niall said quietly, ‘We can't save him.’ Ayda studied their faces, a feeling of dread swept over her as she realised what they might not be telling her. The lifeless body being dropped and not responding through her cries crowded her minded.‘He's dead, girl, better get used to it.’ The older man said.‘They were carrying his body to the river when you spotted them.’ Niall whispered. Ayda slid off her chair and slumped to the floor. Grief swamped her, dragging her heart into the deep dark ocean of despair. She couldn't breathe. No. He could not be dead, he was not allowed to die, he was supposed to protect her. He could not so easily be removed from her life. She shook her head violently, in denial, as if she could rewind the last day and not start this adventure that had cost her best friend his life. She wept. Guilt racked her body, she was shaking. He was just a boy, not yet thirteen. How could they kill a boy?‘Why?!’ She howled through her sobs.‘You're Elves. You would have met the same fate if they had caught you. Which is why you need to leave.’ The man said gently. Both the boy and the man rose, and quietly left the room, leaving Ayda to grieve alone. She never knew how long she spent crying that night, or when her grief turned to blind anger, but she never noticed when Niall entered alone, placing a soft blanket around her shivering frame.",

      "content": "2 - NIALLNiall was curious. She was the opposite of everything he had grown up believing. Ayda was passionate and loyal, and more importantly - she hadn't looked at him in disgust. She didn't trust him, that much was clear, but he couldn't say he blamed her after what had happened to the boy elf. He had watched in awe of her bravery as she insisted she would save her friend, he saw the fire that burned in her eyes and saw it extinguished as grief smothered the flame. He felt as though he had witnessed a person's soul fleeing the pain, dealt by the loss of a loved one. How he wished he could have helped, just to bring a smile to her face. Hours had passed, and it was a clear morning. Today he would say goodbye to the mysterious girl elf. Scrubbing his face in murky water he cleared his thoughts, preparing questions he wanted to ask before she left. He was just as curious about her world, as she was in his. His Pa was outside preparing the cart with goods, the plan was to smuggle the girl out as far as the bridge, he knew the guards would be searching the town and the forest by now. No Elf was tolerated in their lands, and they would make sure all were destroyed for threatening the humans with their presence. The thought made Niall shudder, he would not let any harm come to this girl, she had her own Pa to go home to. Striding down to the kitchen, looking forward to the conversation he had planned, he stopped suddenly when he saw the girl at the rickety kitchen table. Ayda didn't look up as he slid into a seat opposite her, she was staring blankly at the stone-cold porridge in front of her, dark circles set in beneath her puffy eyes. Had she not slept? He thought to himself. Her eyes had none of the energy he witnessed last night, they were dark and deep and lost. He sighed, all thoughts of questioning her faded, he felt pity for her, a feeling he didn't realise he could feel for an Elf.‘Didn’t you sleep at all?’ He asked quietly. She didn't respond, her eyes were still fixed. ‘You should get some sleep in the cart, it will be a long ride home.’‘I don't care. I don't want to go home.’ She said so quietly he almost missed it.‘But your Ma and Pa will want you home.’ He said encouragingly, smiling at her.‘Not when they know what I have done.’ She shook her head miserably, tears filling her eyes again. This confused him, what had she done? Then he thought, if he had taken a trip to Myrliar his Pa would flay him. He had thought of it a few times, hearing that Myrliar was a beautiful untouched wilderness, the Elves cherished and respected nature, unlike humans who destroyed it and used it to their own ends.‘It's natural to want to explore,’ Niall said kindly, ‘I would love to see your lands.’ Ayda looked up at him, as if wanting to say something. She shook her head thinking better of it. Something deep and painful was living inside her, smothering her flame and drowning out her voice, he decided. Grief could do that to a person, but was this something more? It clicked.‘You feel guilty.’ He said simply, realising. ‘It’s not your fault.’ Ayda didn’t respond. Watching her intently, Niall studied the features on her face. Her long dirty blonde hair was messy, her bright blue eyes were red and blotchy, her skin was a sickly white and her lips were pink. She was beautiful, he thought. He felt something twist inside him. He wanted to look after her, wanted to see that fire again. The door opened, and his Pa walked in.‘You ready?’ He asked gruffly. When Niall nodded, he gestured for them to follow. He led them to an old cart drawn by a horse that was nearing its retirement. The man patted the elderly horse gently and whispered something soothing in its ear.‘Ole' Mack here will get you to the bridge safely.’ He assured her.‘Pa's been riding Mack since he was young, he hasn't ever let us down.’ Niall smiled, taking Ayda by the hand and leading her to the horse. Tentatively she raised her hand to touch its mane, it was rough and knotted, he needed a good clean. He leant into her, enjoying the attention. Lowering the back of the cart, the man helped Ayda into it and buried her beneath several empty sacks behind empty crates and barrels. She was so small, she was invisible.‘Niall is going to the orchard on the other side of the forest, you will pass the bridge on the way,’ The Old Man explained. Ayda nodded and buried herself deeper under the sacks. Niall bid a quiet farewell to his Pa before the cart rolled suddenly into a slow pace. The dirt road was bumpy and hard, several times they hit a small rock hard enough for them to bounce and land with a jolt. Niall was soon covered in bruises as they made their way slowly and noisily to the forest. After several minutes of riding through dirt and stone, new surroundings pressed in. Trees enveloped them, and twigs and branches snapped as they caught up in the wheels and crispy leaves crunched underneath. Niall closed his eyes and listened to the rolling wheels against the ground, the birds singing with the breeze as he rocked gently to and fro with the cart. He thought he heard a quiet whimper behind him and guessed that the ride was even more uncomfortable for Ayda. Looking ahead he could see Guards in the distance watching them draw near. As he reached them he slowed to a stop.‘Good morning!’ Niall said cheerfully.‘Where’re you going this early?’ The guard asked suspiciously, narrowing his eyes at the boy.‘My Pa sent me to the orchard, for apples for pastry, Sir.’ Niall said indifferently.‘Uh huh. Check the back.\" The guard barked the command. The other guards paced around the cart, they checked underneath and looked in the barrels. They paid no attention to the empty sacks. Good job she's small, Niall thought to himself. Even though he knew she was there, he could hardly make out any shape beneath the sacks.‘Move on boy.’ The guard nodded, allowing Mack to continue. Niall moved Mack into a walk, pushing forwards through the forest. The forest grew dense, Niall started to carefully manoeuvre between trees and around rocks. Careful with his cargo and his cart, their pace slowed. After an hour, they finally reached the outskirts of the forest, the sturdy wooden bridge was ahead, in plain sight. Niall sighed. He didn't want to say goodbye here, he wanted to see her home safe. The bridge formed over the Myr River. The Myr River separated their worlds, the Humans and the Elves, once she crossed it, it would be too dangerous for him to follow. The Elves would kill him. Checking their surroundings, he pulled Mack to a stop. The fields either side of him were clear, and no-one appeared to be following from the forest behind.‘We're here Ayda,’ He said, letting go of the reigns, and jumping down from the cart. Ayda appeared from underneath the sacks, she stepped down from the cart and pulled her brown cloak close around her. She looks so vulnerable he thought. He felt a pang of sorrow as he realised he would never see this girl again. She would probably never remember him.‘Ayda-’ He started. Thundering behind spun him around as Ayda's eyes widened, watching something over his shoulder. Hundreds of horses were galloping to the bridge on the other side of the river, each rider covered head to toe in glistening golden armour. Niall's mouth dropped as he recognised the Royal emblem embossed onto each chest plate.‘Are they -?’ He stammered,‘The Royal Protectors.’ Ayda sighed, her cheeks flushing, ‘Father has sent them to find me.’‘Your Pa must be important to send an Army to get you huh?’ Niall said, impressed. The Golden Army stopped at the entrance to the bridge. Niall noticed the rider at the front of the Army wore a different helmet to the others, grander and more richly dressed. The rider dismounted and stomped over the bridge towards them.‘Princess! You are safe!? Come quickly!’ He demanded in a strong, concerned voice.Princess? Niall stared at Ayda, who was staring at the golden army with dread etched across her face. She could not go back to Jonas, but she could not go home either. She was broken, destroyed by guilt. Niall sympathised with her as he thought of her explaining what had happened to the boy's parents. He took her hand in his.‘It was nice meeting you Princess. Remember, it was not your fault.’ Niall said quietly as he squeezed her small hand. He watched her walk away silently, determined to remember every part of her beautiful face. He had known her for a mere night and felt as though his life had changed forever. He didn't feel like a boy anymore. Climbing back up to Mack, he watched her walk towards the rider, whisper something to the man and then follow him to the Army. He waved at her, hoping she would wave back. She didn't. The Army turned and moved away, away so he could not follow. Look back, he thought desperately, please look back. She didn't. He felt his heart break slowly as he realised she would never remember him the way he would remember her.",

      "content": "3 - ELLEThe tree looked down on her, watching the world from its great heights. Hidden beneath its bark were thousands of memories. Faces and voices from people over the years, who had shared secrets whilst enjoying its shade or admiring the beautiful blossoms on its limbs. How she adored this tree - it was older than the Castle itself! She patted down her skirts and sat cross legged beneath it. Smiling up at the sun she opened her book. Stories of Knights and Kings filled her heart, one day she would find her own hero, and they would be forever happy, just like the Princess in her story. Sir Rakel was a Knight - in her Father's Guard no less! He was as loyal and as good as one can be. He had once brought her sister home to safety many years ago and for that she would always love him as an Uncle. He and her Father had played games together as boys - they could well be brothers she mused. Her hair flowed in the breeze, long and blonde, she often ran it through her fingers, trying her best to curl it, but she could never do it as well as Amie, her maid.‘Elle! Elle!’ Children of the court called as they ran past her, chasing butterflies, she laughed as the boys fell over themselves in their haste to impress her. She smiled peacefully and returned to the pages before her. Elle would read for hours, given the time. She lived for the hours spent in a dream, a dream world where anything was possible. Today however, she had little time to spare.Later she would be taken back to her chambers to change, there was to be a Grand Ball today, and as Princess she was expected to attend. The Rituals were starting again soon, Elves from all over Myrliar were making their way to the Stone City to partake. The Ball was just the beginning. Elle was very excited, her Mother had said that this year, she was to participate in the Rituals. Even Ayda had never done this!‘Elle, are you coming?’ A young girl Elf walked up to Elle with her hand out.‘Where are you going?’ Elle asked, lifting her head up from her fantasy.‘To try on our dresses!’ The girl exclaimed excitedly. Elle jumped up, she so wanted to see the other girls' dresses! They ran through the beautiful expansive gardens and up the white stone staircase into the Castle. The Castle was pure white, carved, smooth stone from nearby mountain ranges had been brought down and transformed into the grandest Castle in Myrliar. Centuries old yet the stone was not weathered or crumbling, it stood strong and tall, impenetrable but for the ivy climbing up the towers reaching for the sun. Climbing higher and higher the little elves ran, giggling, until they reached the Princess' large and grand chambers. In the centre of the room was a large four-poster bed, delicately detailed with white and gold ornate patterns. A large balcony was situated across the room which allowed sunlight to flood the white walls as the gentle breeze caressed the white lace voiles. Ivy had crawled through the balcony over the years and now veined the walls, climbing towards the ceiling. Luxurious tapestries, furniture and ornaments lines the room, and stunning, colourful flowers decorated the chambers. It was a room big enough for dancing, and grand enough for a much-loved Princess.‘Princess, is there anything I can get for you?’ Amie asked, dropping into a low courtesy.‘I want to see my dress please! Can you send for the other girl's dresses too?’ Elle asked politely, flinging herself onto her large, grand, golden plated bed. The other girls followed, bouncing happily on her soft mattress. Amie disappeared and then reappeared moments later carrying a pale pink lace dress, with pearl flowers sewn into the skirts and ruffles at the arms. Amie held it up smiling. Elle felt so happy she swelled with pride. She had been waiting for today ever since she had received her summons.‘Oh Princess, it's so beautiful, you are so lucky!’ The girls exclaimed, giddy with excitement.Elle reached out and gently caressed the soft lace skirt, she was going to look so grown up in her gorgeous gown. The other girls' maids brought other dresses one by one, each different in their own way, but none as detailed as the first gown. Elle didn't notice, she thought that tonight every girl would be a Princess.Later that evening, the Ball in the Grand Hall was in full swing. Elves were dancing together, smiling and laughing, celebrating the coming days in honour of the Elders and the cherished Royal Family. It had been months since everyone was last together, this meeting was mandatory, those invited had an obligation to their King to attend. If they did not, they were rounded up and brought to the Castle. It was the most important Ritual in their culture. The King and Queen were standing in the marble Royal Chamber, splendid and tall in their floor length white silk gowns, trimmed with gold and rubies, their young daughter standing proud between them, grinning down at her dress, her golden curls cascading down her back. They glanced to the guarded main doors, patiently waiting. The door flung open. A young elf strode confidently into the centre of the room her hard eyes fixed on her parents. Her blonde hair was cut short, not reaching her shoulders, her piercing blue eyes were hard, and her jaw was set into a determined line. She wore no gown, instead sporting a black tunic wrapped around her tightly and trousers with thick leather buckled boots.‘Your Majesties.’ She curtsied low.‘Oh, Ayda, where is your gown? This is a Grand Ball hosted by the Crown for the Elders.’ The Queen waved a hand and brought her eldest daughter closer examining her. Elle grabbed her sister around her middle and pulled her into a tight squeeze. Glancing down Ayda struggled to keep the smile from her lips as she regarded her young sister, a glowing beauty in her ballgown.‘Training takes all of my time and the Elders once again have not summoned me anyway.’ Ayda shrugged. The King and Queen regarded their eldest sadly. Ayda had been set on joining the Army since she was young, not long after Sir Rakel had recovered her. She planned to reject all claims to the Throne, leaving the burden to her little sister. Ayda had never explained to them why.‘You are still of Royal blood Ayda, it is expected of you.’ The King said gently.‘I hear that Elle has been summoned to the Ritual.’ Ayda cut in, ignoring her father's words.‘Yes, the Elders have deemed her worthy,’ The Queen nodded proudly, ‘She will accompany us tomorrow.’ Elle grinned up at her sister proudly, she was pleased to have been selected by the Elders for the Ritual, she had hoped for many years that she would be summoned. Many Elves across Myrliar were selected and summoned to the Ritual, but not all. Elle had been lucky, Ayda had not once been chosen, even though she was still widely considered the Royal heir. Ayda did not seem bothered by her lack of invitation, she was very rarely seen at Court, and was most often at the Barracks with the other soldiers, drilling.‘It is time to make our appearance.’ The King said, moving towards the chamber doors, arm in arm with his Queen. On the other side of the door, the music was coming to an end and voices could be heard, the Royal Chamber doors opened, and the Royal Family stepped through as one. At once, the crowd bowed low in respect. Gliding across the room, the King and Queen moved through the crowds, politely acknowledging those gathered and gracefully seating themselves upon the gold and ruby emblazoned Thrones at the head of the Grand Hall, tiered higher to watch over the people of their realm. One Elvish Lord raised a golden goblet into the air in toast to the Monarchs, and all others followed suit. Music sprang to life once more amidst laughter and many gathered again to dance. Elle stared in awe at her mother and father, seated so elegantly on their thrones. To her they were everything, they were fair rulers, and loved by all. Many Elves made their way politely to speak with the rulers and each were offered warm conversation and smiles from her parents, to them their position was one of duty, not of glory. Everyone marvelled at the Queens beauty, her waist length golden hair laced with simple flowers and the King's strength, how he held and expressed himself to all was to be admired. Together they were formidable, charming and intelligent. Their rule had been one of peace. Elle moved through the crowds smiling and chatting as her mother had instructed. Several ladies of the court commented on her beauty and her childish innocence, she could feel her mother watching her every step, not in warning, but as a mother would watch a child. Ayda had already slipped into a corner in heavy discussion with a couple of off-duty Knights. Most were paying her little attention, just how she liked it. Elle found a few of the girls she played with regularly and found herself called on to dance. Everyone moved aside, and her parents applauded politely with the crowd ready for her performance. As the music started, Elle and her friends slowly placed their steps in unison along the stone floor, elegantly floating through the air, Elle felt light as a feather as she tiptoed delicately with her friends. Gracefully, they spiralled around each other, taking delight from their skirts lightly floating with their steps. Faster and faster Elle spun in time to the music, laughing and grinning happily, wishing that the music would never end. She prayed for a tune that would whisk her to the stars, so she could peacefully dance in the sky forever. Finally, after an age of dancing and gossiping the King rose from his throne to address the Ball.‘My dear friends and family, lords and ladies, welcome back to our Stone City.’ He smiled opening his arms wide, ‘It is wonderful to have you all return home for the Ritual. As you are all aware tomorrow the Ritual will begin, and those who are lucky enough to have been summoned will partake. I am very pleased to announce that our daughter, Princess Brielle, will also be attending her very first Ritual.’ Raucous applause stormed through the Grand Hall at the news, Elle felt herself blush as many congratulated her enthusiastically on the summons.‘This is great news your Majesty!’ One of the drunken lords cheered through the applause. The King chuckled jovially at the sight of the happy court.‘I am very proud that the Elders have accepted Princess Brielle,’ The King continued, ‘I am confident that she will grow to become a strong pillar for Myrliar. Now, in her honour, and for the honour of all those with summons, let us eat!’ With the King's words, the doors of the Grand Hall opened as one and hundreds of golden serving plates with a large variety of delicious foods were carried in and placed on large stone tables in the serving room off the Grand Hall, slowly the room filed out as the Elves placed themselves around the tables and began to happily dine on the meals. The Princesses were seated next to the Queen at the Top Table, and the King was deep in conversation with his Chief Protector, Sir Rakel to his right. Ayda pulled a leg off the nearest chicken and started to tear into it. Elle watched giggling at her older sister's lack of decorum as she delicately served herself potatoes and vegetables. The room was alive with murmured conversation and a few outbursts of laughter as people enjoyed their meal. Elle watched her sister, Ayda was busy chewing her way through the food in front of her, devouring glass upon glass of wine. Elle watched her, she was worried about her. Over the last couple of years, her sister had removed herself from the family more and more, and was dedicated to her training. Elle had watched her best many soldiers in the Arena in both weapons and hand-to-hand sparring. Brielle loved her sister more than anything, they had once been close and now they seemed in different worlds.After the feast, the drinking and dancing resumed in the Great Hall, and Elle forgot her worry for her sister as she enjoyed the attentions of her ladies. Elle enjoyed watching her lace dress circle her feet as she spiralled across the dance floor with her friends. As the night wore on, members of the gathering slowly retired to their own chambers, Elle was commanded to retire.‘But Mother –’ Elle began to protest.‘No, Brielle.’ The Queen gestured for her own Protector, Sir Morcei, to take her daughter to her Chambers. A tall burly man in golden armour and a heavy great sword moved steadily forward from his guard position behind her and nodded, Elle kissed her mother on the cheek and walked gracefully from the Hall, sending wishes to Elves as she left. Sir Morcei always close behind.The Princess' Chambers were large and luxurious. The four-poster bed where she was sleeping was adorned with comfortable silk bed sheets and down pillows, the white lace around her bed hung like a shield around her whilst she dreamt. The furniture in her Chambers was grand and lightly decorated with ornate gold and precious gemstones and the lower floors contained large marble baths for her to bathe in with mixtures of scented oils and fragrances. The lace voile at her balcony bristled gently in the breeze, bringing a fresh floral scent from the gardens below her tower. Slowly Elle opened her eyes and blinked away sleep. The Princess smiled as she smelt the fresh air flowing in from her balcony. She wondered at the perseverance of the ivy creeping into her Chambers through the balcony door, having grown all the way up the Castle walls and spreading across her walls and detailed ceiling. Sitting up, the bed silks slid away, and she slowly peeled herself out of bed. Walking across the room she rested her hands across the stone parapet surrounding her balcony. She stared out at the vast expanse of her city. Her home.Beneath, the white Castle of Stone was surrounded by vast beautifully manicured gardens, blossoming with shrubs and roses, with the occasional rabbit scarpering across the grass. Multiple marble water fountains could be seen and heard trickling in symmetrical points across the lush lawns. Beyond the gardens a treacherous wall of white stone surrounded the Castle. The Guard wall was impenetrable, it was designed to be perfectly smooth with no nooks for foot holes so climbing was impossible. No one had climbed to the top of the wall in thousands of years, with or without climbing equipment. Guardhouses were situated along the wall. Beyond that, she knew there was a stone town, thousands of buildings where her people lived and prospered. Little stalls where locals bought and sold materials, crafts and food. Children would be playing with whatever toy was the new craze and gatherings would be held in the Square where Elves worshipped the Elders. Elle believed her City was the most beautiful city in the world. Nature lived side by side with Elves, flowers grew all around the fountains, the shops and the schools and were left to venture further. There were several large Houses in the City where a couple of the Lords lived with their families, and of course there was the barracks where her sister now lived. The barracks were situated at the First Wall. The wall that surrounded the entire City and its people was taller and thicker than the Guard Wall. Soldiers of Myrliar were housed and trained within the wall itself, where the barracks were carved into the stone. Behind her, on the other side of the Castle lived the Pearl Mountains, the white stone that had resided there had built her home, and the Mountains were protected as a result. Guardhouses were positioned across the Mountain protecting the stones from being removed without prior permission. Elle tore her eyes away from the beautiful City and returned to her chambers. Today was the Ritual. Amie knocked gently on Brielle's doors before entering, and carefully washed and dressed the young Princess.‘Are you excited?’ Amie smiled at her as she brushed her long hair.‘A little.’ Elle replied, distractedly.‘Oh, come on, it's all you've talked about since the sign!’ Amie laughed, threading a silk ribbon through the fresh plaits. Elle smiled, Amie was always full of decorum in front of people, but in private, she was on good terms with the Princess, Elle trusted her as much as family. It had been Amie that had spotted the glowing symbol known as the summons on Elle's hand. In truth, Elle was excited about the Ritual, it was a high honour to be summoned. It meant that the Elders considered you worthy to be of the few in their presence. The Elders were worshipped strictly throughout Myrliar. Thousands of years ago the Elders had ended the War that humanity had started over new land. Myrliar had suffered heavy losses, lost countless numbers of people and even more in the famine that followed when the burned fields failed to yield crops year after year. The Ritual provided Elves with a chance to commune with the Gods, if you were lucky enough to be summoned you were one step closer to receiving their blessing. They would not be seen, but they could be heard by those chosen. To hear them was the rarest honour in all Myrliar. It was believed they would come to the aid of Myrliar once more, with advice and knowledge that no-one alive bears. Elle's breath caught in her chest. What if they spoke to her? She was merely a girl. What could she do with such knowledge? Suddenly the weight of the Ritual fell on her. She had been caught up so deep in the honour of being summoned that she hadn't realised the importance of the Ritual. She shook her head, no-one alive had been spoken to. It wasn't likely they would speak to a girl.‘You're ready.’ Amie said lightly, patting the Princess gently. The young maid with shoulder length red hair stood from her seat at the dressing table and tapped on the chamber door.‘The Princess is ready for her escort.’ She said politely to the Protectors on the other side.The doors creaked open and the Protectors stood solidly in their Golden Armour waiting for the Princess. Their helmets masked their faces and their stance was commanding, they rarely spoke a word except for orders and safety advice. Brielle walked with them from the room and down the corridor. The Castle was bright and airy and was alight with excitement. She followed the Protectors down deep into the Castle, the bright white walls were soon replaced with cold dark ones as they buried themselves in the tunnels deep under the Castle. Elle was pleased she had asked her mother questions before today, otherwise she would have wondered why they were leading her deep underground with nothing but a flickering flame to guide them. Slowly a long queue of Elves both adult and a few children could be seen waiting patiently outside several ornate double steel doors, their excited faces illuminated by the flickering wall lights.‘Move aside.’ Her Protector grumbled as the crowd parted to allow the Princess through the narrow corridors to the front. Seeing her parents at the head of the queue she sidled in between them nervously. The Queen looked down at her young daughter and winked discretely. The corridors were full of Elves, all looking at the steel doors expectantly. There were no handles, they must open from the inside, Elle thought. The halls were eerily silent. No whispers, just a pregnant silence that succeeded in making her even more nervous. Even her parents were staring patiently at the steel doors. Elle pressed up closer to her mother, her tiny trembling hands reaching for the Queen's. Suddenly the steel doors creaked and whined as they slowly opened, teasing the onlookers with the gradual pace. Minutes passed until they opened widely enough to let them through. The queue moved forward, the King leading them through. Brielle noticed quickly that there was no-one in the Ritual Chamber. Who had opened the doors?! Gradually the Elves filtered into the large circular chamber. The chamber was pitch black, in the centre was a large glistening pillar of faint light, just enough light to enable the Elves to position themselves in circles around the centre, the higher-ranking ones in the centre ring. Brielle took her position a few steps from her mother in the centre ring closest to the pillar of light, once in the room, no one could touch another, so distance was key, her mother had instructed. Looking up in amazement, Elle traced the light to hundreds of crystals embedded in the ceiling, propelling the beam of faint light directly downwards. Looking around, the chamber was black, she could just make out the white of people's eyes. As the final Elf took up their position, the steel doors closed with a loud resounding clunk. Elle flicked through her memory of her mother's instructions, what did she do now? As one, the Elves in the Ritual Chamber lifted their left hand towards the pillar of light, she followed suit. At once, the symbol on her hand appeared as a bright prominent blue light on her skin, as it had done on the day of summons. Alarmed, she looked around and was relieved to see that every Elf had the same symbol on their outstretched hand. She noted that all were of differing brightness, some hardly shone at all. Looking back at hers, she was forced to quickly shut her eyes. The light emanating from her symbol was painful, it was blinding. No one in the chamber had as bright a light as her. The room was beautiful, hundreds of symbols shone like blue stars on a night canvas. She looked to her side, her mother nodded knowingly, a ghost of surprise etched on her face as she took in the brightness of Brielle's own light. The Queen shut her eyes, as did the others. Brielle closed hers tight. A warming sense of peace took over, her hands stopped trembling. This was it she thought, this is when the Elders could speak to me. Nothing happened. Everything was silent for what felt like hours. Elle felt bitter disappointment rise inside alongside a growing feeling of boredom. Had she really expected the centuries old Elders to speak to her when they hadn't even spoken to her parents? Did she think she was better than them? She shook her head to shrug off the thoughts, then she heard it. A girl's voice. It sounded far away, she couldn't make out the words. She strained her ears trying to hear it again. The voice was so faint, and young.‘Hello?’ Elle thought, trying to connect with distant voice, excitement building.‘Get out.’ The girl whispered back, her weak and ghostly voice crystal clear.‘Who- who are you?’ Elle asked nervously in her mind, unsure if she was sane.‘Get out!’ The girl whispered more urgently, her voice laced with fear. Elle hesitated, trying to keep her eyes closed to keep the connection as her mother had told her, the fear in the girl's voice was overwhelming, she felt her own panic rise. A piercing scream vibrated painfully through her mind. Elle's eyes sprang open in alarm, instantly she was blinded by the brilliance of white light that seared through her. Her heart was racing and her breathing erratic. The cold dark room had changed, the white pillar of light in the centre was strong - not the fickle light it had been before. Beads of white light were flowing through the room feeding the pillar’s light. Elle watched open mouthed as the beads spiralled up the pillar and absorbed into the crystals at the top. She looked down at her small body, thousands of pearls were emerging from her body and soaring towards the centre of the room. Elle's eyes widened in panic as her hands tried to collect the tiny glowing beads and return them to her body, they flew through her easily as if she was air. She looked around hastily, everyone had their eyes closed. She watched as the small, bright orbs left her mother's and father's body and glided to the centre. It was happening to everyone she realised. Her mother and father were at peace, smiling, unconcerned. Scrunching her eyes shut again, trying to calm herself, desperately willing the Ritual to be over, she longed to speak to her mother about the pearls and the girls voice, to make sense of it. Finally, after a long and empty hour, with nothing but her confused thoughts to keep her company, Elle heard the chamber doors abruptly heave open. Opening her eyes, she glanced around cautiously, the pillar of light was dim once more. She frowned, had she imagined it? Others were starting to wake and move silently out of the Chamber. Waiting impatiently, she watched her parents come around, rushed up to their side and followed them out as quickly as she could, not wanting to spend any more time in the chamber. She hoped in her heart she would never go in again; the girl’s scream was a horror she would not forget. Something in her face must have betrayed her worry, as her father looked down at her with a frown. Calling over her protector the King sent her back to her personal Chamber.‘I will speak with you later my dear,’ He whispered gently in her ear before she departed. Elle nodded without a glance to him, eyes distant, wondering. Following her Protector up through the Castle, she barely took in her surroundings. She was confused, she should have kept her eyes closed. The Ritual was meant to be a mental connection between them and the Elders. She had broken her connection the moment she opened her eyes. But the scream, the scream was what truly terrified her. She could not explain the fear that had settled under her skin at the girl’s mental touch. Who was she? Were the Elders in danger? She would speak with her Father later, he would know what to think. Yes, she thought, her father could fix everything. She smiled, how could she be so worried when her Father was her own personal brave and strong Knight? Reaching her room, she waited. Her Father would come, and he would make things right. He always did.Later that day, as the sun began its descent, a gentle knock came at Elle’s bedchamber. Slowly the doors silently opened to reveal Protectors positioned at the entrance and a tall gentle man entered the room. The King’s luxurious emerald cloak swept the marble floor as he walked softly through the room. Brielle was sat at the corner of her bed, watching the sun set with sad eyes. The King sat beside her and placed his hands on hers.‘The Ritual must seem like a burden for one so young,’ He said softly. Elle shook her head slowly, eyes still gazing at the setting sun. ‘It is important that you understand what the Ritual is for,’ He continued, ‘none have ever met the Elders, they are centuries old and although we know their story, of their rise, none of us have their wisdom.’ Brielle listened intently, hoping that her Father’s explanation might help her understand what happened in the Chamber. ‘I believe the Elders have vital knowledge that we can benefit from. The Elders send instruction, advice and knowledge through the Rituals and through the Scholars.’ Her Father continued to explain the Temple of Scholars. The Temple was situated north of Myrliar at the Three Thorn Mountains, it was said to be the beginning of the Myr River, built around a huge waterfall that fed the flow of water. No-one Elle knew had ever been to the Temple, but maps had shown her the rough location. The Scholars were widely regarded as Wardens. Their Temple was full of ancient books and records, it was believed that the Elders communicated with the Prime Scholar, sharing knowledge for safekeeping. It was from the Scholar’s Temple that the past histories and stories from the Elders reached them. Stories of murder, death and disease spreading from the burning evil of humanity, were the reason they were encouraged to eradicate humans from Myrliar for safety, and it had been that way for centuries.‘The wise words of the Elders have kept us safe for many years, no war has come to Myrliar and our people have prospered. Do you understand the importance of this Ritual?’ He said softly, brushing her hair from her face.‘I understand Father, but what if I displease them?’ She looked him in the eye and urged him to feel the deep worry that ate at her.‘What could you do to displease them?’ He laughed, stroking her cheek, ‘You are a beautiful young girl with a great kindness in your heart, no doubt that is why you received summons!’‘I opened my eyes.’ Elle said sadly, tears in her eyes, she knew her Father would be angry at her for disobeying orders. She jumped as he laughed loudly. Shocked, she looked at him and saw his eyes glowing with pride.‘See?!’ He laughed pulling her tightly to him and kissing her softly on her head. “I think we have all opened our eyes momentarily during the Ritual my dear, it’s rather difficult to resist!”Elle could have laughed with relief, so they were not going to be angry with her for breaking the connection. She felt a weight lift from her shoulders they had all seen the pearls too.‘What are the little balls of light?’ She asked him.‘Balls of light?’ He frowned, deep in thought, ‘It’s pitch black in that room! Are you sure your eyes weren’t adjusting?’ Elle looked out to the last remnants of the Sun, her room was nearly lit solely by candles, she watched as tiny lights glittered on the windows - was it just a trick of the light? It must have been, she reasoned, no-one else had seen it. Elle shrugged, and shimmied up to her pillows, helping her, the King pressed the bed covers gently around her.‘Goodnight sweetheart,’ Her Father pressed his lips against her forehead and made towards the door.‘Father wait! The voice …’‘The Elders spoke to you Brielle. Only you. Do not share with anyone what they told you unless they have permitted it. You may not understand what they have said, but in time you will. I have faith in you.’ His voice was soft but stern, he looked at her, understanding. She thought she saw a flicker of sadness in his face as he left the room, his eyes never leaving hers as he closed the door with a snap. In that moment Elle felt alone, she desperately wanted to help the girl she heard, but without her father, she had no idea what it meant. Had the Elders spoke to her? Did they need her help? What could she do – she was just a girl?",

      "content": "4 – AYDAAyda was hurt, she was sore and aching all over her body. She had been training in the Barracks with her fellow soldiers today, she enjoyed pushing herself to her limits. Calculating her enemy and out manoeuvring them was her speciality. Today she had been partnered with Syren, a ferocious young red-haired Elf, who had proven deadly with her twin blades. Ayda had been pleasantly challenged as Syren was as strong and as fast in combat as her. They had congratulated each other at the end of the duel when there was no clear winner. Detaching herself from the Arena following the bout, Ayda had instantly hurried through the darkening City back to the Castle of Stone. The City was beautiful. Every building, home and market wall was built from the same white stone as the Castle. Each stone had been brought from the towering Pearl Mountains that stood tall behind the Castle and was knitted together with vines and veins from plants that bloomed through the streets. Market holders had begun to pack away the remains of their wares, fabrics, food and tools were boxed away by their owners, whose faces betrayed their daily sales. Many Elves smiled and waved at her as she hastened through their streets. She felt safe, there was no enemy here, this was her home. There were small elves playing in the streets with friends, she could hear their families calling them in from the approaching night. She was keen to hear about the Ritual, interested in celebrating Elle’s excitement, she could already imagine her sister’s tiny face shining with pride. The drawbridge was down, Ayda hurried across and was allowed entry without question, even with her light armour and sword still about her waist from training. The Castle was splendid against its backdrop. The sun was setting behind the Pearl Mountains, marking a glowing outline around the Castle, glints of light were dotted along the walls, towers and turrets as torches were lit inside the expansive halls and corridors. As night approached, the Castle of Stone was alive with hundreds of elves gossiping and talking about today’s Ritual. Many were busying themselves with work along the corridors and assisting in the needs of guests. Most curtsied or bowed politely as she passed hastily. Spotting Amie heading towards a small, concealed wooden door, she guessed was the servant’s quarters, Ayda made towards her.‘Is my sister in her rooms?’ Ayda asked breathlessly.‘I believe so your Highness.’ Amie curtsied, smiling at her. Ayda thanked her and taking the marble and gold Grand stairway two steps at a time she vaulted up and up, racing to the top of the Ivy Tower where her sister’s bedchambers were.The Castle was richly decorated, abundantly dressed in historical and precious artefacts. Ornate pottery and glassware shined on plinths throughout corridors, and the great white walls were layered with portraits of Elves who had long passed, their haunted eyes stalking the living. Many of the artefacts in the Castle represented the Elders. Stone ornaments of four all-powerful figures were common site along the walls, usually gifted to her family. One wall proudly beheld an extravagant tapestry which seemed to tell the tale of the Elders triumph. Four white-cloaked Elves were rejoicing on the field of battle, their fallen enemies scattered around them. Whoever had created the artwork had never met the Elders for they had no clear faces, the tapestry was deceitful and boasting and Ayda despised it. It showed nothing of the folly of war, no blood and no destruction, just the great triumph it held. Ayda sprinted past the tapestry not wasting a moment’s glance at it, anticipation grew within her as she drew closer to her sister’s bedchambers. Not bothering to knock, passing the stationed Protectors, Ayda burst into her little sister’s chambers.‘Elle! Tell me everything!’ She exclaimed proudly, prancing into the dimly lit room. Elle appeared from the balcony. The setting sun was casting a radiance across their lands, the City below them seemed golden, and the light sparkled from the Garden’s pools. Ayda had to pull herself away from the temptation of the view.‘Ayda?’‘I knew you’d be awake waiting for me,’ Ayda said proudly, placing herself on the edge of the luxurious bed. Her sister sidled over, reading Ayda’s expression and taking her in. Spotting a nasty green bruise on Ayda’s cheek, Elle wailed.‘Who did that to you!?’ She wailed, jumping and gently touching Ayda’s face. Ayda shrugged her off patiently and gestured her into bed. Her face lighting up with pride.‘How was it? Did they speak to you?’ Ayda asked excitedly. No-one ever discussed what happened in Ritual Chamber with someone who wasn’t summoned, but she knew her sister would tell her everything if she bullied her enough.‘Father told me not to say.’ Elle mumbled.‘Oh please! Elle come on – what happened?’ Ayda urged.‘It was just a dark dome chamber, we had to close our eyes.’ Elle whispered, shrugging. Ayda regarded her sister solemnly. This was not the reaction she had expected; her younger sister had been excited about this day since her little hand had lit up with the summons and now she was suddenly too embarrassed to speak.‘You aren’t disappointed that they didn’t speak, are you? You know it’s very rare and it was your first Ritual.’ Ayda reasoned slyly, patting her sister on the arm, ‘Anyway I doubt they’d speak to a little Elf, you’re not old enough!’‘I am! They did!’ Elle exclaimed, a hand shot to her mouth as she realised what she’d said.‘They spoke to you?!’ Ayda said loudly, shocked. It had always been easy to trick her little sister into speaking, but she hadn’t been expecting that. Elle was angry with herself, she pursed her lips together determined not to mention anything further.‘What did they say?’ Ayda urged, still reeling that her little sister had been whispered to by the Elders. Elle shook her head furiously and crossed her arms. Elle was not going to speak to her. A dark shadow crossed Brielle’s face as her gaze wandered to the view from her room. Silence followed, Elle started slowly rocking backwards and forwards, her eyes fixed. Ayda could not take her eyes from her sister, she seemed vulnerable, worried and distant, not at all what she had expected. Sitting patiently, long minutes passed as she waited for her to speak.‘I’m scared.’ Elle whispered finally, staring into the darkness, ‘I wanted to tell Father, but he told me I should keep it to myself.’ Ayda pulled her sister gently into her chest. She loved her sister immensely. Brielle had always been the kindest, softest, sweetest girl. Ayda knew that Elle would have turned desperately to the King, out of a child’s love for her father, but he had unknowingly forced the girl to keep a secret that would burden the child’s gentle nature.‘Tell me as much as you want, I promise if I can help, I will.’ Ayda said kindly. Elle nodded, relieved that someone she loved had listened and heard her plea. But she refused to say any more. Ayda tucked her in, beneath the bed sheets and told her stories she hoped would lighten her spirit, Elle had liked listening to the adventures her sister went on. There was always one adventure that Elle would beg to be told, yet Ayda had never told a soul. That story she would keep within her forever, she could not face speaking it. Somehow, tonight Ayda found her sister was not listening. Elle did not gasp or laugh at the proper moments, instead gazing transfixed, lost in her own thoughts. Finally, after an hour or so, exhausted, the little Princess drifted to sleep, Ayda sat in an armchair close by watching her sister sleep fitfully. She planned to confront her Father and explain the fear she had witnessed in her once carefree sister, something had happened to her in that Chamber, and she needed to find out what.Ayda awoke shortly before the sun, sitting up quickly in the armchair she had slept in. Rising, she moved towards the balcony. It was still dark outside. Ayda breathed in the fresh morning air. It was likely she would be riding most of the morning to arrive at the border for midday, and she was still sore from yesterday’s sparring. In the reflection of the glass, she could watch her sister sleeping soundly in her bed. Moving towards her she placed a kiss on her forehead and murmured a quick farewell anxious to leave her in peace. Leaving the room as quietly as she could, passing the Protectors at the door, Ayda followed the white marble, spiral stairway down.‘Ayda, I guessed I would find you here.’ A gentle voice greeted her as she reached the base of the stairway.‘Father,’ Ayda replied, inclining her head slightly, the King raised his arms to embrace his eldest daughter. He squeezed her tightly against him, as if it was their last embrace.‘We will miss you, stay safe.’ He whispered into her hair.‘I will only be away for a matter of weeks Father,’ Ayda frowned, releasing herself from his hold.‘Ah, of course, but each day without your sharp wit pains us all!’ He winked at her.Ayda snorted. Her parents were always full of grace and decorum when surrounded by their peers. However, in private, she could not deny they were fully devoted to their daughters. When Ayda had informed them of her decision to join the Golden Army, they had been shocked, and had attempted to hide their disappointment that she would eventually renounce the Throne, but they had supported her. Their only request was for her to maintain her duties for a time, to protect her small sister from the pressures of the monarchy at such a fragile age. She had of course, consented. She knew in her heart, that when the time came, and Brielle had found her confidence, she would make a much stronger Queen.‘Have you spoken with Elle?’ The King asked gently.‘Yes, she is scared. I have not seen her this way before.’‘She has every right to be scared,’ Her Father sighed.‘What do you mean?’ The King placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and looked her straight in the eye.‘The Ritual was hard for her. She will need her sister to guide her and protect her.’ Ayda nodded instantly, confident that no matter what trials her sister faced, she would be there for her. However, she felt there was something that he was not telling her. His loving face had aged, she thought, there were lines and shadows under his eyes she had not noticed before. Concerned for her Father, she opened her mouth to speak.‘Father –’ Ayda began,‘You had better get going! You don’t want the Patrol to leave without you!’ He chuckled, punching her playfully on the arm. He was right, she was cutting it fine. She launched herself through the corridor without a backward glance at him. He was King she thought, he must have many demands and worries to make him appear thin. Relaxing, she flew out of the Castle and through the grounds, ready for her next Patrol.",

      "content": "5 – NIALLThe men and women in front of Niall were loyal. Scoundrels, yes, but they were his scoundrels. They had done many jobs together over the years, raided many manors, hunted troublesome men, and frequented more taverns and pubs than they could remember. Here they were, ready for more. Their dirty, scarred faces could tell many stories, their leather protective clothing had seen better days. Niall looked around at them all smiling. Taking a long swig of cider from his flagon, he wiped his mouth on his arm and opened his arms.‘My Fiends!’ He said loudly, grinning from ear to ear, ‘Tomorrow we undertake another brave and chivalrous task! Tomorrow, we will be bringing home riches to our wives and ladies!’ The men and women roared, banging their flasks loudly on the tables around him in celebration. Niall laughed loudly. Standing from his chair he finished his flagon and slammed it down on the table. A beautiful, curvy barmaid was leaning against the bar, watching, a smile playing on her bright red lips. The Bridge Inn was their favourite meeting place, it was a private, quiet inn on the outskirts of Oakwood Town. Niall liked it because it served his favourite Green Grain Cider, but also because Martha, the barmaid, was easy on the eye and easy elsewhere. It was widely known as The Hole, most people stayed away, but the Fiends made sure the pub lost no revenue for it. Niall gestured to the musician for the music to start, and a jovial violin sang its way through the Bridge Inn. Taking a seat between two men he clapped them both hard on the back.‘Good turnout for this one!’ Niall said loudly over the music.‘Word is travelling about your leadership for sure,’ His friend mused, ‘Everyone left the last raid with very heavy pockets!’‘Bryce has trust in you.’ Karl added sternly. Niall frowned at his friend.‘Bryce knows I care about Oakwood. I bring gold and resources. He benefits greatly.’ Niall dismissed with a wave of the hand. They both nodded.‘He is getting old, maybe he intends to put you forward as his successor.’ Niall ran his hands through his thick dark hair, he had grown into a good looking, rugged young man and was committed to the success of the people in his town. He had joined the Fiends ten years prior, after he helped a mysterious girl escape the town unnoticed by the guards. This feat had earned him the respect of Bryce, the Master of the Fiends, who tutored him carefully to become his Deputy. Bryce had approved of the young boy’s morality and believed that the Master of the Fiends should be wise enough to make smart decisions with the heart as well as the mind. The Fiends, after all, was an underground organisation to benefit the people who most needed their help. Karl and Theo were recruited with Niall as boys, they had trained in weaponry, surveillance and combat together and had become as brothers over the past decade. Theo had been a kind-hearted boy who had been chosen for taking a beating for his younger brother, loyalty the Fiends could not overlook in one so young. Karl was cunning and strong, he was an orphan who outwitted the Town Guards on many occasions, once succeeding in locking the Guards out of their own Barracks so he could feast on their stores. Now, all three were lethal. As a three, none in the Fiends could challenge their skill with a blade. Their ability to foresee each other and move together rendered every enemy powerless, as they rapidly struck blow after blow, never killing unless necessary. As was the strict code of the Fiends. Tomorrow, the Fiends were heading out to the border of Myrliar. The Elven Border patrols were being recalled early, scouts had informed them, leaving the Fiends with a clear evening to plunder the closest Elven Lords without too much of a fight.‘I cannot believe the Gold Army recalled their Patrol from the borders so early without reason.’ Karl said simply.‘What do you mean?’ Niall asked his friend.‘We have looted these Lords before, how could they be so foolish to leave them unprotected?’‘You smell a trap?’‘Yes. No Commander recalls border patrols without first sending relief.’ Niall nodded. This thought had occurred to him too. He had informed his scouts of his worry, they were to report straight back to him if they caught wind of any form of soldier movement at any point. The Patrol had not yet headed home, they were due to depart in the morning, according to their source the new Patrol would be arriving late that same evening.‘I have prepared for that my friend.’ Niall rested his arm on Karl’s broad shoulder. Karl was a mountain of a man. He had little to no sense of humour and simply said things how they were. Niall enjoyed the honesty, it was a relief to have a friend not afraid to tell you if you were in the wrong. Karl grunted and downed his drink, raising the tankard to a maid for a refill.‘If you are wrong, we do not have enough swords here to fight a Patrol.’ Karl said, staring at Niall firmly.‘Niall has not led us astray before, Karl.’ Theo soothed.‘Astray is probably the wrong word.’ Niall winked at them. Theo was the smallest of the three, his dirty blonde hair was tied back, and his frame was slight, making him light-footed and fast. His face was young and lacked the knowledge and edge of the others, but it was friendly and approachable. Karl did not respond. He had bowed to the inevitable that they were going, and he was to once again put his trust in his friends. He continued to glare at the wall, drinking.‘Such a merry soul.’ Niall jibed, elbowing him in the ribs. A slither of a smirk turned the corner of Karl’s mouth. Niall leaned back in his seat and crossed his arms above his head, kicking his feet up on to the table, sighing contentedly he looked over at Martha. One of his men was leaning over the bar to converse with her intensely, judging the look in his eye he was enthralled by her. Niall chuckled, Martha was stunning, and better, she was confident, she could easily disarm any man. Except Karl, Niall thought, he doubted there was a woman for Karl, if there was she would be damn scary. Martha caught his eye and sauntered over to their table where she sat herself comfortably on his lap.‘I see you caught yourself another fish,’ Niall said mockingly.‘I can’t help it you know, you Fiends love a damsel in distress, and I can never seem to convince you that I’m not her.’ She fluttered her eyelashes. Martha held herself in such a way that made her irresistible to him. He loved her confidence, when he was away he knew she could look after herself, she was never a victim. The things he saw her do with that silver dagger she kept hidden in her bodice, would be enough to deter him from getting on the wrong side of her, never mind a drunken brawler.‘Is Bryce going with you?’ She asked.‘No, he has business with a merchant at the Capital.’ Niall said, casually smoothing her dress.‘So, you’re the Boss again.’ She winked at him seductively.‘Well, I guess I am.’ He replied sweetly. Martha leaned forward to press herself against him. Karl rolled his eyes and removed himself from their presence muttering something under his breath, Theo blushing, quickly followed him to another table thick with smoke and choking laughter, leaving Martha and Niall alone.The room was small and dingy, an old wooden wardrobe, double bed and crooked table and chair was all the furniture it contained. Several beams of light shone through the moth bitten holes in the curtains, creating shapes on the wall opposite. It was mid-morning. The bed groaned as it’s occupant slowly sat up and adjusted his eyes to life. He was alone. Pulling back the bed linen, he hastened to his feet. Grabbing his shirt, he pulled it over his head to cover his bare chest and pulled on his trousers and boots. Running his fingers roughly through his hair and then flattening it he stopped as he heard someone on the other side of his door. A couple of taps echoed through the thin wood and it creaked open loudly.‘Morning,’ Martha sidled into the room, encumbered by a large bowl of water and fresh cloth. ‘I thought you might want to wash before you leave, the rest are starting to gather downstairs.’‘Thank you,’ Niall said, relieving her of her burden and setting it on the table. He pulled her into his arms, and smelled her heavy perfume filling him up. They stood there for a moment relishing each other’s warmth, knowing this would be the last time they would be alone for a while.‘Don’t wait for me.’ He said dully, she smiled knowingly in reply.‘You’d better hurry, they need you.’ She whispered, pulling free and leaving the room. Niall knew she understood, there was no love in their relationship, neither wanted it. They merely enjoyed the excitement and impulsive nature of each other. Whilst he cared for her, and she for him, they were friends and they didn’t need anything more complicated clouding their focus. Quickly, he washed the dregs of last night from his face and wet his hair, dampening it to flatten it. When he was done, the dusty floorboards creaked as he left the room.Downstairs, the men and women of the Fiends were sat, talking amongst themselves whilst eating their way through mounds of bread, eggs and cooked meats the kitchen had provided. Niall plonked himself heavily down next to Theo and Karl and helped himself to the food in silence, contemplating the task at hand. Once the scraping of knives and forks had subsided and the chatter began to quieten down into a room buzzing with silent expectation, Niall stood and took his place at the centre of the room.‘Here we are,’ He said clearly, loudly. ‘Today is the day we have been planning for. Today is the day we will journey as one into Myrliar. I don’t need to tell you how dangerous it is for us to travel there. You all know. We all know the dangers we humans face on the other side of that river. You know the plan. Stick with your group and we will return home, richer and fatter than ever.’ He began to pace around the room, joining hands with several of the Fiends. Several applauded, confident of the plan. Niall led the group from the hall, out into the yard where fifty horses stood tethered to fences and paddocks, laden with empty sacks. One by one, riders mounted their steed. Cheery and expectant faces looking towards their leader, hopeful of the riches this day would yield for their families. Leading the troop, Niall pushed his stallion into a walk, steady and strong legs pushed forwards through the dirt path, a mixture of coloured horses behind him carefully navigating the path through the fences. Finally, when he was sure everyone was following, Niall broke into a canter, moving confidently towards his target. Dust clouds followed as the troop followed the dirt path through the forest, several children playing in the undergrowth waved at them happily as they passed by. The thundering of hooves roared within him as his heartbeat quickened with excitement, faster they rode, the uneven ride tough on his joints as he bounded in his saddle. They rode on as the forest grew thicker, the grey skies hidden behind the tops of trees. Niall’s eyes were fixed forward in determination, eyeing the Myr Bridge in the distance he kicked his horse faster still, desperate to reach their quarry on time. The hordes followed, it must have been an impressive sight as the riders emerged in a tight force galloping towards the bridge, their leader pushing them harder as their hooves echoed across the fragile wooden bridge. Niall glimpsed upwards, noting the dark clouds rumbling as a cavalry charge towards them. He cursed quietly to himself.‘Could cause us problems!’ Karl said loudly to him as he rode up beside Niall. He nodded in agreement, they could have done with a clear day today. The storm had ridden in unnervingly fast. He felt water run down his face as the clouds liberated their wealth onto the ground below. Ignoring the rumbling thunder and the bright claps of light piercing the dark sky he pressed forward, never slowing, despite the heavying rainfall. Their horses began to squelch and whine through the sodden paths as the rain lashed down. The wind was fierce, and Niall could feel his stallion waning beneath him.‘We should turn back!’ Karl yelled through the storm. ‘The horses won’t be able to keep this up!’‘We’re nearly there!’ Niall replied loudly.‘This storm is punishing! How do you expect us to pull this job off Niall?!’ Looking behind, Niall noticed large numbers of his men turning tail and running back on their exhausted mounts, leaving swamp like paths in their wake as the earth struggled to hold water. Niall was not going to give up, he had been waiting for an opportunity for a long time, and he knew the Patrol would have left by now. They had to get there soon! Pushing on for an hour with only his closest friends now in tow, he nearly laughed with relief when he saw the white stone of the manor through the storm’s rainy veil. The rain was not slowing. His clothes were sticking to his skin and his hair was drenched through, his horse was breathing harshly beneath him as he slowed down to a brisk walk, not daring to slow too much for fear of becoming stuck in the earth.‘What’s the plan then?’ Karl snarled, water pouring off him, ‘There’s only six of us.’‘We’ll have to lower our expectations for a start.’ Niall muttered, squinting through the downpour. The small group moved forwards, each one soaked from head to toe, each weakened horse struggling to push through the sodden ground, fighting through the wind.‘We need to find somewhere dry, so we can make a new plan!’ Niall announced. Theo was pointing, following his finger, Niall saw an old, crumbling stone barn not far from them, and in view of the manor. He nodded at them, and quickly they rode their horses to shelter. Niall heaved himself off his stallion.‘Eurgh.’ He moaned as his boots sank deep into the mud. Creeping around the barn, he spied through the wooden door. Nodding to the others, he led his horse inside. For ten minutes, the barn was full of disgruntled scoffs and curses as they all dismounted and checked themselves and dried out as much as they could. Finding an old lantern, Niall lit and hung it from some old rope on the ceiling.‘Thank the Gods for that storm, they are really looking out for us!’ Niall said jovially.‘Why are you so damn cheerful?’ Karl demanded angrily, tipping his boots and letting the water pour from them.‘Why not? We are here, and the Patrol isn’t - as we planned!’ Niall smiled sarcastically at his wet friend.‘Aye, and most of our men are probably cosy by their fires right now!’ Karl spat.‘Well get going then! Why did you follow if you don’t want to be here?’ Niall asked, his temper flaring.‘Niall what do you plan to do? We are only six men.’ A quiet voice came from the corner.Spinning around, Niall watched as Theo rung out his messy hair and attempted to tie it back once more. The thunder growled, and lightning sparked the sky.‘This storm’s good for one thing - we’ll have to sneak in.’ Niall said simply.‘We should at least get some rest, that was a tough ride and we need our energy to get home.’ One of the companions suggested.‘No, there is only a small window until the new Patrol arrives, we must move quickly.’ Niall dismissed. Shaking his head, Karl picked up his gear from the floor in preparation, the other’s followed suit, clangs of metal sounding as each readied his weapons.‘I don’t like this Niall, not one bit.’ Karl said gruffly, staring his leader straight in the eye. ‘But I cannot walk away knowing you are likely to die.’ Niall rested his hand on Karl’s shoulder, a small smile playing on his lips.‘We are just going to have a look my friend, I will not put any of you at risk if nothing can be gained.’ Niall said softly. Karl nodded in acceptance. The door to the barn complained gently as it was slowly opened, and the group trailed out one by one, leaving the horses to rest in the dry. Niall, at the helm, crouched as low as he could and briskly crept carefully toward the dim flickering light emanating from the manor. The rain was lashing down, his comrades were close behind, but he could not hear the squelch of their boots in the sodden mud over the deafening roar of the storm. All around the sky was black and unyielding, the occasional flash of light flew overhead, lighting up the darkness for a split second. A couple of times, Niall had to roughly tug on his boot to free himself from the flooded fields. Finally, they reached the outer fence of the manor. The storm was unrelenting, showing no remorse to the suffering fields and the crops that gave up their hold, and began to float away sadly in the torrent. Keeping low, Niall approached a window of the manor. No sooner had he reached it, he ducked down from view with a gasp.‘Damn it!’ He cursed. Inside the hall of the manor, were several men dressed in rich golden armour, helmets laid aside as they were entrenched in deep conversation. The Patrol had not left.‘They must have changed their plans when the storm came.’ Karl muttered in his ear. Niall sighed. That was it, he thought. They could not risk a confrontation with the Patrol, they would all be slain for sure. He guessed the men in the hall were the leaders, so the Patrol must still be around. Hidden beneath the grey skies and curtain of fall. Niall had failed. He was going to be a laughing stock. All the months of planning, the perfect opportunity washed away by the storm. The damned storm! He screamed silently in his head. Where had this cursed storm come from? The ground had been bone dry, there had been no rain for months! With his face screwed up in disappointment he spun around and lead his men back to the horses, not taking care to stay hidden, too angry that this great haul had been robbed from him. Reaching the barn, he pulled open the creaky door and stepped inside. Stomping over to his horse he saddled up, hearing his comrades wordlessly doing the same. Each bitterly disappointed and exhausted from the rain and the effort this pointless raid had costed.‘Don’t even think of getting on those horses.’ A blade was at his throat. A figure roughly spun him around, the cold metal never leaving his skin. Looking to his comrades, he saw they too had been caught by surprise. Theo had a sword aimed steadily at his heart, Karl had his blade pressed upon his assailant but was also threatened by steel to the throat. Niall groaned in irritation. They had been bested. The only one out of the six to have realised the trap had been Karl, and he was in no better a position than him. Three more figures emerged from the dark shadows of the barn. Considering the face of his attacker he realised it was a woman, she had long dark hair and a hard face drenched by the rain. They must have walked straight passed them. He could have kicked himself.‘What are you doing here?’ A female voice asked. Niall looked towards the three from the shadows. All the attackers wore black cloaks. Each soaked to the bone, the cloaks clinging uncomfortably to their forms. He glimpsed the shape of amour beneath them, they had been cleverly disguised in the storm. The golden armour they wore beneath their cloaks would have been just enough to detect, but in the storm the black of the cloaks had made them invisible.‘Just seeking shelter from the rain ma’am.’ Niall said politely.‘Humans don’t seek shelter in Myrliar.’ She answered quickly. Stepping forwards, she lowered her hood and shook her head, shaking off the rain that was running down her face. Her blonde hair was cut short, her skin ghostly white, he was startled by her piercing blue eyes. He knew those eyes.‘We got lost.’ One of his companions said quietly. The Patrol laughed loudly. The woman holding Niall giggled quietly to herself, not loosening her grip on him. One of the Patrol was laughing whilst disarming each of them happily, examining each blade as he stole it from its sheath.‘Oh? You just happened to wander over the Myr Bridge by mistake, did you?’ The she-elf laughed.‘We should just kill them, Ayda, there is no point talking to them. They are all liars.’ One of the guards said clearly.‘Yes. That is the law, there is to be no human on Elven soil. Take them outside an end it.’ An older guard behind Ayda agreed nodding. Niall couldn’t take his eyes off Ayda’s face. It was her. It was Ayda. She was watching him, a cold stare reserved for his kind he guessed. Niall felt the elf holding him give one strong heave and he moved towards the door. He heard his comrades scream and curse as each were bustled and ripped away from each-other and pushed through the barn door. From the sounds of it, Karl was doing a good job of fighting off the guards and had now been upgraded to the honour of three captors to restrain him. The screams were drowned out as the thunder tore across the sky. He could not turn from Ayda. He had saved her - why was she letting them do this to him? She was watching him intently. Anger inside him grew, furiously he attempted to rip away from the she elf. Why was Ayda not helping? Then he saw it, a glimmer of recognition on her face. Her lips parted in slight surprise, as finally she remembered the boy he had been. As he continued to struggle with his guard, he saw it, the glitter of metal in the hand of a guard behind Ayda. He advanced towards her quickly, blade in hand, aimed for her.‘Ayda!’ Niall shouted in warning. Everything was a blur, immediately he found himself freed as his captor threw her blade with precision and planted it into the throat of the assassin. Ayda whipped around smartly and plunged her dagger into the stomach of the second who had stepped up soon after. Niall crossed over to her and found himself standing in her defence once more. This time he was not alone. The elf who had released him had her blade held high and was staring at him incredulously.‘He’s a friend Syren.’ Ayda said softly, eyeing him up. Making a split decision to trust him, as other guards in her Patrol turned to attack, Ayda passed him a dagger. Two more guards advanced, ducking a blow Niall spun around to neatly tackle the man to the floor. Just as Syren danced quickly behind and slit the other’s throat. Niall planted his fists one after the other into the Elf’s face, bloodied, he lay unconscious on the floor. ‘We need to leave!’ Niall yelled. The barn door smashed open and Karl and Theo ran in, bruised and battered and armed.‘What the hell is going on?’ Karl shouted advancing on Syren and Ayda. Niall dived in front.‘They are coming with us!’ Niall shouted, straining to be heard above the storm. Racing to the other end of the barn, Niall took a moment to calm down the horses who had been whinnying through the commotion as he took the reins and mounted. Gesturing to the other horses the others followed suit. Syren had to help Ayda onto a horse who was clearly shaken in disbelief. Leading the way out of the barn, Niall blasted through the doors and back into the peril of the storm. Welcomed by the sounds of metal on metal and dying elves, the horses raced away from the barn, the sounds of death and danger spurring them on.‘Run, Princess, run!’ A dying soldier screamed at Ayda as he dealt out blows to guards trying to mount other horses, until he was finally ended with a spear through the heart. They ran faster than ever before. The horses galloping through the storm, lightning cracked the sky, thunder laughing at them as they flew as far away from the manor as they could. Niall turned to see Ayda rushing to catch up to his side.‘We must go to the Stone City!’ She demanded through the weather.‘What? No! We need to get as far from here as possible!’ He yelled in reply.‘My sister needs me!’ She cried, even through the rain he could see the tears in her eyes.‘It’s too dangerous!’ Niall warned. Ayda shook her head and pulled her horse back to Syren. Then without another word, they changed course and ran west, their horses speeding off into the distance. Damn her, Niall thought. She’s still the stubborn girl she used to be. Checking that Theo and Karl were still with him, they ran on and on only resting when the Myr river came into view.‘They weren’t that interested in us.’ A gruff voice came.‘What do you mean?’ Niall asked, exhausted.‘As soon as were tackled outside, the guards started killing each other. I don’t know what started it.’ Theo said.‘The other lads got caught up in it, Kev took a bolt to the eye, but we managed to get back to you.’ Karl explained.‘Gods.’ Niall breathed, ‘They tried to kill Ayda.’‘That was the girl, wasn’t it? The elf girl you saved all those years ago.’ Theo whispered quietly. The storm had passed in the night. The ground was still flooded, and their hooves were still sliding in parts, but the air was quiet, and the rain had stopped.‘You know if she goes back to the Stone City, she’s dead.’ Karl said simply.‘That’s not our concern. She knows the risk.’ Niall waved a hand. Even as he said it he felt bitter. He was angry with her still, angry that she had put him through that and angry that she had once again left him without a word.‘If you didn’t care you wouldn’t have stepped in.’ Theo said slyly. Niall ignored him. He wanted the safety of Martha and her Tavern. However, he couldn’t shake the nagging regret since watching Ayda ride away. She had run towards danger to save her sister, he had run away from danger to save himself. His clothes were uncomfortably itchy, and the rain had left him cold to the bone. He longed for a hot meal and bath. As they approached the river, the sound of rushing water flooded over him. The river was a lot wider than he remembered. It had burst its banks.‘Unless you have a boat I think we’re stuck.’ Theo said hopelessly. He was right, the skeleton of the bridge could be seen sticking out of the flooded waters, but the rest of the bridge’s carcass had long been swept away by the deluge. The river was dirty, water from the fields had flown into its veins and the water was speeding south towards the sea. They could not go home. ‘There’s only one thing for it then.’ Niall said, his mind made up. ‘We go to the Stone City. She stole our horses.’",

      "content": "6 – ELLEAyda had not been there when Brielle had awoken, but Elle could tell from the impression left in the armchair cushions that she must have stayed well into the night. The gentle tapping of raindrops softened the harsh silence of a cold and dreary morning. Brielle watched the trail of tears slowly descend the glass and unite in a puddle. She stretched as she wandered over to the closed balcony doors, pressing her face against the cool glass she watched her breath fog on the inside. The gardens were rejoicing in the sudden downpour, water droplets were dancing off marble sculptures and pools happily bursting with overflow. It was early, the sun was shadowed, Ayda was probably riding to the border by now. Elle already missed her. Amie tapped on the door and walked in with a breakfast tray.‘Good Morning Princess,’ She smiled warmly.‘Hello Amie.’ Elle replied, sitting before the silver tray and cutting up her eggs and toast.‘What are your plans for today?’ Amie had started making up the bed. Elle shook her head, her mouth too full of egg to respond, though she didn’t feel much like eating, she knew Amie would fuss if she didn’t at least eat something.‘I think the young ones are going to be leaving with their parents tomorrow, so maybe you can play with them today?’ Amie continued kindly. Elle didn’t feel like playing today, the weather outside matched her mood perfectly. She had had nightmares all night about the screaming girl. She was tired and aching from tossing and turning most of the night. There was a nagging darkness at the back of her mind that something was amiss, but she was too scared to talk. She yawned widely.‘Oh dear, maybe we should tuck you back into bed?’ Amie said, concerned, immediately noticing the young Princess’s fatigue. As Amie, lead the Princess back to her bed, a thundering knock resounded through the room.‘I am commanded to escort the Princess to the Throne room.’ A Protector shouted clearly through the door. Amie smiled and rose to her feet winking at Elle.‘The King has need of you sweet Princess. I’ll just ask the Protector for time for you to dress.’ Striding confidently over to the large oak doors, the moment the handle was turned, the doors flew open and threw the young elf to the other side of the chamber. Brielle screamed as the huge Protector picked up her maid by the throat.‘Run Elle!’ Amie whimpered, before the Protector threw her from the balcony. Brielle jumped up and sprinted from the room, her nightdress flapping around her ankles as she ran from her chambers. She scurried down the spiral staircase and slammed straight into a wall of gold.‘Got her!’ Someone grabbed her arms painfully and picked her up as if she weighed no more than air. Kicking and screaming, Brielle struggled restlessly. Crying out for her mother and father, weeping for Amie. The Protectors were supposed to keep her safe – what was happening? Finally, she was thrown to the floor. The cold hard stone floor hurt her face as she was shoved into it, the force causing her to flinch for a moment before the wailing continued.‘Ah, good morning Princess Elle!’ A warm voice welcomed her. Blinking stars from her eyes from the fall, Elle looked up hopefully. Her mother and father’s thrones were in front of her, undamaged, strong and standing tall as usual. Seeing them gave her strength. Her parents were King and Queen, this act of aggression would be treason. Looking around, there were twenty or so Elves dressed head to toe in Golden Armour, she could no longer tell which one had mercilessly carried her or which one had murdered poor, innocent Amie.‘Where is my father the King?’ She whimpered quietly, looking at the man stood by the throne. He was dressed in a blood red cloak, his face covered by a black and gold detailed half-mask. She recognised the garb from stories told by the Temple of Scholars. He was of the Legion.‘He – ah – will be joining us shortly. Your mother too if we’re lucky!’ The man said happily, wringing his hands. At that moment, a loud crash resounded through the throne room, several Golden clad soldiers clattered into the room, dragging a middle-aged man between them. Brielle watched in horror as the kindly face of her father hit the floor when the Guards shoved him brutally to the ground. Brielle screamed out for him and crawled over to him, helping him to his knees. Clutching him closely she glared up at the Guard who was whispering to the red cloaked man. She was struggling to keep herself steady. Her heart was hammering against her chest and her body was shaking in fear. Her Father’s weakness and harsh breathing were not giving her hope.‘Let my daughter go.’ He commanded, clearly. Pushing himself up feebly, the fallen King regained his footing and straightened up, his eyes fixed on the leader.‘Now why would I do that?’ The masked man swept down towards him, his face inches away from the King’s. ‘You have displeased the Elder’s in the most unforgivable way.’ He spat.‘I have always fully supported the Elders, always acted upon their will.” The King said calmly and clearly, his eyes locked in silent combat with the Captain.‘Almost always.’ The Captain smiled, revealing a full set of perfect teeth.‘If I have angered the Elders my daughter need not pay for it!’ The King declared. Brielle watched with fire roaring in her heart as her Father stood tall despite obvious injury. Her eyes watered as she heard the slightest plea in which he hoped to save her from this misery. He had positioned himself between her and the Captain, determined that none should harm his child. Watching him, Elle knew it would be only too easy for him to overpowered physically, and yet no one here seemed to care that he was their King. The power her father once had was gone.‘Do what you are here to do.’ The King said calmly, ‘Please spare my daughter.’ The Captain laughed a cold and cruel laugh, many of the golden clad audience chuckled with him. Elle used the opportunity to seek a friendly face, one of the Guard must still support them! Sir Rakel was not here, nor Sir Morcei. She recognised no one. They were alone. It was just her and her father against all these battle-hardened Knights. The fire in her heart flickered, she could see no way out. Her Father’s strength had dried her tears, she felt them dry and stiff on her cheeks. She would be a strong Princess, like Ayda, not a child.‘It is because of your little elf that I am here.’ The Captain said softly. Instantly a buzzing vibration reverberated through the air, at the same moment bolts of white lightning sparked from the Captain’s hands aiming straight for Brielle’s heart. She froze in fear, but the lightning struck an invisible barrier that surrounded her. The invisible barrier vibrated louder with each pulse of lightning that coursed through it leaving ripples in the surface. Elle screamed, not understanding what was happening. The lightning was bright white and dazzling her, she braced herself for the pain she was sure to endure as the lightning continued to batter the shield. Finally, after long moments of holding her breath, the attack ceased.‘Yet another rule broken your Majesty.’ The Captain jested, beginning to circle around the pair, ‘No-one is allowed magic!’‘I swore never to use it!’ The King barked back, ‘But you threatened my daughter.’‘Very well,’ The Captain replied, ‘You first then.’ A split second brought more power forth. Elle was still on her knees, staring transfixed as her Father shielded and blocked repeatedly strong sparks of power with invisible barriers. Her father had magic! Elle’s mouth was open. She had not known. Magic had all but disappeared in Myrliar, she knew the Elder’s had magic, but no-one had been born with the gift for centuries! Yet her father was here, defending her with shields of power, concentrating with all his strength. Occasional bursts of power shot at her randomly, testing, but her father deflected them. Movement all around alerted her to the Guards, some were fleeing the room! We could win Elle thought excitedly. Getting to her feet, Brielle watched with her heart in her mouth, hoping her father had enough strength to get them out of here.He didn’t. As his power ebbed, the shocks ripped through his weakened shield and seared through his body, his mouth and eyes wide in shock as he stood paralyzed by the electricity coursing through his body. The Captain laughed coldly as a remaining Guard plunged his sword deep into the King’s back. The world around Elle fell away, as she watched her Father, the King’s body fall to the ground. Brielle could feel the piercing cold of ice smother the once roaring flame where her heart used to be. She could not stop her hands from shaking, no longer from fear, but from anger. An anger so deep it filled every inch of her body she felt close to vomiting. Her father was dead. Tears fell from her cheeks as she lost control, she raged, every ounce of pain exploded from within her. She felt power flow through her, the exhaustion and fear that had before suffocated her now fuelled her power. The ground grumbled and shuddered violently beneath her feet and the great white walls of the Castle’s Throne Room cracked and crumbled as Elle’s power grew. The muffled sounds of screaming and death filled her ears distantly as the ceilings gave way and crushed the Guards below. She could hear metal armour scraping the floor as survivors attempted to drag themselves away from the wreckage. The storm outside grew as monstrous as her soul, the sky was black as shadow, thunder and lightning cracking the air ferociously. Elle never noticed the huge glass windows behind her parent’s thrones explode and impale several Guards running from her, she never noticed as the ground around her gave way, bodies falling into the mountainous abyss below. She wanted to hear them scream, see life leave their bodies, and she wanted nothing more than to cause their pain. Several blasts of power bounced against her shield, a shield she never knew she’d created. The masked man of the Legion was in front of her, levitating above the emptiness she had created. She focussed on him, the battering of his power against her shield was barely noticeable. The debris around her stampeded towards him, his shield held – just. Shocked, the Captain withdrew, with one sharp lightning lance that pierced the darkness and blinded her. Frustrated, Elle spun around in search of him, he was gone. Casting out the last of her magic, destroying anything in her path, she caught sight of someone slipping away. She was lost in her pain. He meant something to her. His body was sliding, slowly towards the crater she had ripped into the earth. Soon he would be swallowed by darkness. She was lost. Her anger and hatred had consumed her. Tears filled her eyes again as she remembered and found herself regaining control. Her father. Just in time, she used the last of her magic to grab him and lift him to her. Her father. She had nearly lost him forever, he had nearly fallen. Silence enveloped her as her magic faded. The storm quietened to its natural grumble. All she could hear was her ragged breathing, her body still shaking. She clutched him and buried her face in his bloodstained clothes. Elle looked into her father’s staring eyes realising with a heart wrenching sob, she had lost him forever. He had fallen.",

      "content": "7– AYDAThe storm had taken its toll on them. Ayda’s cloak was soaked through and clinging to her frame, water running off the light armour beneath. Syren’s red hair was darkened with water and stuck flat to her body. Their horses were broken, exhausted from the hard ride through the dense forest that surrounded the First Wall of Myrliar. The wall was now visible, the storm had finally cleared as quickly as it had raged. The rain and winds had been heavy when she had left Niall, but that storm had turned deadly and angry almost instantly, as if the Elder’s themselves had conjured it. The clouds had thundered in black and dark, haunting the world. Ayda had not slowed despite the danger, she was desperate to get her little sister to safety. The treachery of her comrades clung painfully at her heart, she would mourn their friendship later, for now, she had to get to Elle.‘We can’t just walk into the City, someone clearly wants you dead.” Syren said quietly to Ayda.‘We have to find a way in and quickly,’ Ayda insisted, attempting to hide the panic in her voice, she could not bear to think what could be happening to her family, they could already be dead. No, she thought, I cannot think like that. Hiding their weak horses in the brush, Ayda and Syren slowly approached the First Wall, hiding behind a cluster of trees, they scoured the wall. The Wall towered above the ancient trees of the forest. Small, iron barred windows were dotted along it, figures of Guards and Soldiers could be seen moving from window to window carrying out their daily duties. Ayda was grateful for her training, as a Soldier of the Golden Army she knew the First Wall and the Barracks within very well. If they were careful maybe they could sneak through unnoticed.‘They’ve closed the gates!’ Syren whispered urgently. Ayda’s eyes snapped to the entrance of the Wall, the huge stone and steel gates were down and sealed, shielding Myrliar from any unwanted visitors. Ayda sighed, the situation had gone from difficult to impossible. The gates of the First Wall were only ever closed at time of war with the Humans, in her lifetime, she could not remember them being sealed once. Were they keeping her out, or her family in?‘What do we do?’ Syren asked, still crouching low behind the trees next to her. Ayda looked around helplessly for inspiration, she felt the panic rising, she had no idea how they could penetrate a wall that an Army could not bring down. She considered scaling it, but the white stone was so smooth they were not going to get a foothold. ‘I could always try to sneak in, the Guards are looking for you not me.’ Syren suggested. The thought had occurred to Ayda, but she had no idea how her friend would explain being without the Patrol, they must know they were close sparring partners. It was too dangerous. She relayed these thoughts to the red-haired elf.‘So, we can’t climb, dig or walk in.’ Syren muttered, kicking the dirt in frustration. Ayda ignored her friend. A sickness had crept to her stomach and was threatening to pull her on all fours. Her little sister was so far away from her. Ayda had been able to fight her way out with help from her friends, but Elle was so small, so weak, she would stand no chance of getting away from the Army. Then there were her parents, the King and Queen of Myrliar. Had they lost power? Had someone risen and removed them from their Throne? Was anyone in that Castle fighting for them? Ayda felt helpless, she had ridden hard against the ferocious storm to help her family, but she was still no nearer to holding her little sister. Syren, spotting the look of defeat on Ayda’s face moved forwards.‘I’m sure she is safe, no-one could deem your sister a threat, Sir Rakel or Sir Morcei would have got them out, I’m sure of it.’ At the mention of Sir Rakel, a spark ignited, fighting the deep despair in which she had begun to drown. He was a lifelong friend of her Father, no matter what, he would be standing with her family. She smiled weakly at her comrade.‘I thought you two would be in and out by now!’ Someone called to them close by. Three men climbed through the thicket towards them. The leader walked lazily, swinging his arms with a carefree look on his face. The two men behind looked much less at ease, both with their hands firmly around the hilt of their favourite blade.‘What are you doing here?’ Ayda spat at Niall.‘That is not nice.’ Niall jested, ‘I thought Princesses were supposed to have manners.’ He dipped quickly into a bow with a smile on his face, the handsome young man to his left smirked.Niall clapped his hands together carelessly. ‘So, what’s the plan your Highness?’‘What?’ Ayda asked confused.‘How are we getting in there to get the little Elf?’ Theo asked enthusiastically from Niall’s left. Ayda blushed, embarrassed. She had no plan. She had absolutely no idea how to get into her own home. Niall laughed loudly. Karl smacked him on the back with a firm ‘Quiet!’ which silenced him momentarily. ‘The Princess doesn’t know her own home Karl – it’s funny.’‘What are you going on about?! Do YOU know how to get in? You’ve never even been here before.’ Ayda spat angrily at him for mocking her. Niall shrugged.‘Here’s the deal. I’ll get you in that Castle, get your little Princess and then we take our horses back.’ Niall said simply. Ayda felt a slight annoyance at the bargain. So, he had not come back to help her, he just wanted what was his.‘Fine.’ She snapped. Niall grabbed her hand and shook it so excessively, she knew he was playing with her. She was not in the mood for his games, she wanted to see her family so desperately she would do anything it took. Niall gestured for them to follow him. Ayda followed him and his friends at a slight distance, she heard him complaining to Karl about the smack he had received and rolled her eyes.‘Where do you think he’s taking us?’ Syren whispered to her as she walked close by.‘I have no idea. He seems to know where he’s going though.’ Ayda replied quietly.‘I think we should get rid of them. It’s the law, I don’t trust them.’ Syren said, her voice full of loathing. Ayda knew her friend would be distrustful of the humans, Syren didn’t have any kind memories of any that she had encountered, all she saw was pain and years of hate. Ayda looked at the young man prancing in front of her. Niall was certainly the boy she had met when she was a child. He was still naughty and mischievous, she was curious as to his sudden knowledge of Myrliar. Ayda had not been too happy to see him, memories of her old friend had resurfaced upon seeing his face, a past she wished would stay in the shadows where it belonged. How annoying that Niall should save her life not once – but twice! Niall continued leading the way, she knew they were following the outer wall round as the five of them traipsed through the forest surrounding the Stone City. They grew closer and closer to the Pearl Mountains.‘If you’re planning on climbing the Pearl Mountains to get to the Castle then stop. There are Patrols protecting the Castle from anyone attempting this.’ Ayda called to him. Niall ignored her and walked on. Furious at being ignored, she sped up to him.‘How can you possibly know where we’re going?’ She demanded.‘Do you want to stand here and talk, or do you want to get to your family?’ He said exasperated. She nodded, agreeing that the conversation could wait until she had Elle under her wing. Ayda was angry with him though, his whole demeanour angered her. Her family was ruined, and he was taking a daily stroll through the forest. How can he know more about this Castle than her? He was a stranger, and this was her home. The mountains were so close now, clusters of brilliant white boulders were dotted around the forest and against the First Wall. She felt no nearer to her sister. ‘You two wait here.’ Niall said without looking at them. He, Theo and Karl, swords raised wandered behind a group of rocks, larger than two homes and disappeared for several moments before Theo reappeared and waved them over.‘Had to check it wasn’t guarded.’ Theo shrugged leading the way behind the towering rocks. Ayda’s eyebrow raised as she saw Niall and Karl leaning casually against the rock, swigging from his hip flask. Behind him was a small rough tunnel entrance well hidden from the eye.‘How did you know this was here!?’ Ayda said, dumbstruck. Niall laughed, reattached his flask to his belt and led them down towards the tunnel mouth. The tunnel itself was a squeeze, single file behind Niall they all followed, tripping occasionally on loose rock and uneven ground and crouching beneath low ceilings. The bright white stone darkened slowly as they moved deeper into the tunnel, Ayda realised that very soon they wouldn’t even see each-other. She suggested they each place a hand on the person in front’s shoulder, she was then repulsed to realise she had to touch Niall, who was humming a tune. Theo behind her and Syren and Karl behind him, they tripped and meandered through the black tunnel of white stone.‘Are we going to get lost?’ Syren echoed through the darkness.‘No, thankfully there is only one way to go.’ Niall explained, who was using his hands to feel the wall as he stumbled on, with Ayda’s disgusted hand on his shoulder. More than once the party had to stop as someone tripped and fell, amidst cursing and bruised knees Ayda was getting fed up.‘Why didn’t you prepare a torch?’ She asked bitterly.‘Because you were in a rush.’ Niall replied shortly, he was no longer humming and Ayda could tell he too was aching from his most recent trip. Good, she thought. Thankfully after an age of hiking light pierced their eyes. Ayda squinted from the harshness but was relieved when fresh air and warmth filled her. Her feet found level ground as they left the tunnel. Her eyes adjusting, she looked quickly around. They were in a garden. Her friends were squinting, pausing as they took note of each other in a silent head count.‘Oh my – Ayda!’ Syren shouted in alarm looking over Ayda’s head in shock. Ayda spun around. What she saw brought her to her knees. She screamed loudly and unashamedly crying for her family – how could they have survived that? The others stood as still as the mountains as they attempted to make sense of the scene before them. A vast portion of the once proud White Castle had collapsed. The Towers and parapets had crumpled into themselves and the walls of her home had crashed to the ground, hidden beneath a thick layer of white stone dust. Bodies of soldiers, servants and lords were scattered or crushed beneath the centuries old stone. Ayda could hear the ghost of the crashing collapse of her grand home amidst the eerie silence of destruction. She could distantly hear the agonizing screams and shrieks from the people unlucky enough to be trampled by the cascading stone. The Stone Castle had fallen way before she had arrived home, yet she imagined and felt every ounce of pain as the great symbol of protection fell to its knees in defeat. Her home was gone, what had happened to her family? As though on fire, Ayda launched herself forward. She could see that the Throne room and Grand Halls were just standing, fragile and leaning on the verge of collapse, the rest of the Castle was sand and dust. Leaving the other’s behind she hurled herself through the gardens jumping over rubble and ignoring the sounds of the dying. She HAD to get her sister! Distantly someone was calling her name, she climbed the white stone steps, skipping over more debris crumbling from the remnants of her home. “Elle!” She shouted repeatedly. She did not care who could hear her, from her eyes all that was left was pain and death, there was nothing here she could be bothered to fear. Her sister was her lifeline and her courage. Someone grabbed her roughly from behind and pulled her to the floor.‘Get off me!’ She snarled, kicking out she winded her assailant before crawling back up the steps.‘Ayda stop!’ He shouted. She recognised the voice.‘Help me Niall!’ She shouted desperately as she floundered up the dusty steps in such a hurry her feet could hardly keep up. She felt him push her as she regained her footing and propelled her forward with him running to keep up. She reached the Grand Hall, the beautiful masonry of the walls was crumbling, and the stone floors were veined with slits and cracks. The ornate tables were crushed beneath parts of ceiling and several statues of ancestors had been unceremoniously decapitated or flattened. Slower and more cautiously, Ayda and Niall moved through the Grand Hall, the large oak doors at the top of the rooms were off their hinges as the doorway had started to waiver. Climbing over the doors together they entered the Throne room. Ayda gasped as Niall cursed. Tens of Golden Clad soldiers were littered along the floor. Some had been impaled and some had shared the same fate as the Castle. Ayda’s eyes brimmed with tears as she saw her parent’s thrones standing, untouched and glistening against the odds. The chink of stone on stone fell like the pitter patter of rain, as portions of the last bones of the Castle began to fail. She heard a quiet sob. A childlike sob. Casting around she took in every detail of the room she had feared the most. Her heart burned with a heat so intense as she saw the blonde curly hair of her little sister.‘Elle!’ She cried loudly in relief. She bounded over to her sister with Niall just behind. ‘Oh Elle! I’ve been so –’ She stopped. Brielle looked up with her big puffy red eyes revealing the body she was clinging onto with every grain of strength she had.Their Father.The relief she felt at finding her sister was smothered by the sorrow that now shrouded her heart in ice. Her Father’s eyes were closed, his face peaceful. Reaching out, Ayda gently removed dust from his cold, lined complexion and pressed her lips to his forehead, vaguely aware of Niall lingering a polite distance away and the continual rain of stone around them. Death surrounded them on all sides, she knew they could not stay here, but she was content to stay trapped in this moment, as she knew with all her heart this would be the last time she would see her father’s kind face, the last time she would feel his fingers entwined with hers. He was cold, Elle was not. She had to get her sister to safety. Her Father would thank her for that. She pulled hard at Elle and tugged her away from the fallen King,‘Come on Elle, we need to go.’ She said softly, a lump catching in her throat, ‘Leave him, we cannot help him.’ Hearing crumbling stone, Ayda wasted no time in heaving the weeping Princess away. Ayda could not believe how easy it was to walk away from her Father, but she knew that Brielle was now her only priority, she had promised her Father to protect her, he would be urging them to leave this death trap. Niall led the way out from the ruins in silence, time seemed to freeze as the walls continued to crumble and groan. Not daring to look back at their home the Princesses climbed the Castle rubble and returned to their friends in the Gardens.‘Any trouble?’ Karl asked gruffly as they approached. Niall shook his head solemnly and moved towards the tunnel entrance without stopping. Following his lead, the others followed on in silence. Ensuring Elle was safely following Syren, Ayda braved one last look at her childhood home. Glancing around she shed a tear as the Castle groaned a relieved farewell as it slid to the ground in a cloud of white dust, no longer straining to protect those who had grown up in its safety.The walk back to the horses was a long and quiet one. After Niall had briefly explained to the other’s what had happened, no-one felt much like talking. The loss of a King was a shock, but the loss of a Father felt like a death sentence. Their Father was dead, and from what she had seen, she doubted her Mother was alive. Ayda grieved for them, for she now shouldered their responsibility. She had to find out who was responsible for the attack on her family and she had to protect Elle. Ayda looked down at the young girl, clutching at her arm. Her blonde hair was messy, her nightdress dirty and torn and her face blotchy and red, Brielle was never going to be the same carefree little Princess she was before. As they reached the horses, Ayda took the reins of hers and Syren’s mounts and pressed them into Niall’s hands. Their deal was complete.‘Thank you for all that you have done for us.’ She said quietly, not able to look him in the eye. Why was it that whenever death touched her life, he was always close by? She could not look at him, she was afraid that she would see the eyes of those she had lost.‘Where are you going now?’ He asked.‘North, up to the Wastes. I need to keep Elle away from here. I cannot lose her too.’ Niall looked over his shoulder towards Theo and Karl, who returned his look with a nod each, they mounted their horses and readied themselves. Niall placed the reins back into Ayda’s hands.‘You won’t get far without these, it’s a long way.’ Niall said with a slight smile as Ayda met his understanding eyes. He had known loss himself, he lived with the emptiness she saw. For the first time she found herself wondering what happened to the boy she had left behind, what had happened to his Pa? With a slight pang of guilt, she remembered that after all the past years she had forgotten her saviour’s name. Niall lowered himself, so he was face to face with Elle. He held out his hand and took her palm in his.‘Your Highness, if you are agreeable, my brothers and I would like to join your Guard, until it is safe to leave your side.’ He said pleasantly. Brielle watched the stranger closely, taking in every feature of his face. She looked up at her sister with wide eyes and moved closer‘Why are humans in Myrliar?’ Elle whispered to her sister. Ayda winced at her words, she knew that Syren would prefer their human counterpart’s dead, or at least banished, but Ayda found that a part of her trusted them, despite their differences.‘They saved my life, Elle, and helped me get to you.’ Ayda replied calmly. Syren moved forwards.‘We don’t need them anymore Ayda, we have Princess Brielle.’ She said stiffly. Ayda regarded her friend. Syren was a fierce young warrior, she had trained with Ayda since they were young elves. Her vibrant red hair was plaited messily after the recent rains, her stance glistened of confidence and skill, with her blade at her waist and her glistening greaves and vambraces. Syren wore minimal armour, she hated how heavy it was, and Ayda could not deny that her friend was quick for it (she had taken many sharp jabs from her during sparring).‘That’s the gratitude we get for saving your lives?’ Karl snarled at her.‘I believe the attack on us benefitted YOU greatly!’ Syren replied hotly, her voice rising.Ayda watched her comrade with admiration. Syren was almost half the size of Karl, who was a beast of a man. His huge arms and shoulders were built for sheer strength he looked capable of crushing Syren with his bare fist, if he could catch her first. Syren look unaffected as she stood her ground before him.‘We should go back Niall, Elves will always be Elves.’ Karl dismissed walking away from Syren. Niall looked at the little Princess who was watching with round eyes, and then turned to Ayda. He looked at her miserably.‘Is that what you want?’ He asked softly. Ayda looked to her friend apologetically, she hoped she would forgive her.‘All I want is to protect Elle, I have lost everyone I love, she is my life now. She is the future.’ Ayda began seriously, ‘If you swear to help me protect her, then you are most welcome.’‘But they are HUMAN Ayda!’ Syren repeated, aghast.‘Yes Syren, they are human. Our sworn enemies. But who has murdered my family? I see no human hand behind this.’ Ayda reasoned with her friend calmly. Syren backed down. Ayda knew they were both stung and hurt by the betrayal of their own comrades and had no way of defending them. They had to find out why her family had been overthrown by their own Army, she had to know why she had lost her parents and her home. She could only thank the Elders that her young sister was beside her, she was never going to let her go. Syren mounted her horse in silence and moved forwards with a nod to Ayda, who was already comforting Elle and helping her into the saddle before climbing up behind her. Niall clapped his hands together in eagerness and vaulted on to his saddle, patting Karl on the shoulder as he passed. Karl, still scowling, followed on behind Theo’s horse, positively glaring at the red head in front. Ayda sighed, this was not going to be an easy alliance. As the sun began to disappear behind the Pearl Mountains, the horses trudged on through the quiet forest, north past the Stone City. The occasional patter of water droplets on leaves could be heard as a gentle breeze whispered through the trees. Ayda had decided they should proceed at a steady pace for now, as the horses had been riding hard throughout the day and they had no knowledge as to the whereabout of their enemies. The elf did not want to lead them headlong into an army on exhausted mounts. Ayda had to admit even she was tired. The allies had not stopped for breath since the attack on Ayda and had rushed to save her family. Silence had blanketed each of them, too tired, too weary and too agitated to talk. Syren was still leading from the front, determined in her anger at being made to work alongside humans, she had not spoken a word since they mounted their steeds. Weakness had overwhelmed the older Princess. The darkness of the night was a bright light compared to the shadow over her heart. She could not shake the memory of her father, pale and cold in her poor sister’s arms. She longed to speak to Elle, to ask her what had happened, but she feared she should not interrogate her so soon. She was so fragile, she was like a small and intricate ice sculpture that she dared not hold for fear but could not bear to set aside defencelessly. She was sure that Elle would talk to her. Eventually.‘We must camp.’ Theo announced, making Ayda jump slightly. She turned in her horse to look at them. There was no sound of hooves on dirt, no whinnying, they had stopped all around her and, yet she could hardly see them.‘Theo’s right, if we continue in this dark we risk laming our horses.’ Niall agreed. She heard him moan as he dismounted and a moment later his boots hit the ground with a squelch. The other’s murmured their assent. Ayda did not much like the idea of stopping, she had hoped to distance themselves from the Stone City, but they had not even reached the edge of the forest.‘Ayda, the soldiers in that Castle were dead, I don’t think we have anything to fear this night.’ Niall reasoned, his hand appeared from the darkness to help lower Elle to the ground.‘They will return.’ Ayda said firmly, her legs aching she clambered off the horse.‘They will likely regroup first before returning, and they will not want to travel in this. We will move north again as soon as we can see where we’re walking.’ Niall said patiently. Ayda hesitated, she wanted to move Elle on.‘Ayda, they think they have Elle trapped in there. The City is on lock down and no-one’s seen her leave. We have some time to rest.’ Syren said tiredly. Ayda turned around and saw a roaring fire had already been lit, the warmth of the fire swept over her cold, damp and aching body like a wave, leaving the tips of her fingers tingling with pleasure. The crackling fire persuaded her. Her comrades had moved closer to it and were warming themselves peacefully by the flames. The ground surrounding the fire quickly dried out and she found herself grateful for the shelter the thick trees provided. Slowly each of them settled down to relax by the fire. Ayda unravelled some of the belongings from her horse and was relieved to find the previous rider had provided them with a few essentials. After drying out some blankets by the fire, Ayda set about making a place for her sister to rest. Theo had disappeared for a short while after stopping and had returned with a couple of hares which he then prepared and cooked on the fire. Everyone had eaten quietly except for Elle, who refused. Elle had been sat by the fire, staring into the dark abyss around them and not talking to anyone, occasionally panicking when Ayda left them to find something amongst the trees. Niall and Theo however seemed to have a career in conversation, they led a constant stream of jovial chatter which seemed to have common themes of ale, women and trouble. Although Karl did not join in the chatter, whenever his name was brought into the story he soon grumbled something about ‘exaggerating’ or ‘stupid’ or whatever name he thought Niall suited most at that moment in the story. Niall found the insults amusing and chuckled to himself whenever Karl offered a new one. They had a strong bond, Ayda could see that, they had grown up together and joined the Fiends together. They were brothers in life if not by blood. Ayda called Elle over to her. The young elf rose obediently from her place by the fire and settled in with the leaves and blankets of her make shift bed.‘When you want to talk to me, you can.’ Ayda whispered to her, stroking her sister’s long curls. ‘But rest for now, we have a long way to go.’ Elle closed her eyes to give the illusion of sleep, Ayda knew she was not likely to get any sleep tonight, they had lost their Father, Mother and Home in less than a day. They had also lost the love of their country. Nothing in their upbringing prepared them for this and now they were blind in the dark, surrounded by humans they hardly knew except for some distant childhood memory. Ayda had no idea what to do. She needed answers and Elle could give her them. Her patience was running thin and the responsibility was bearing down on her. Standing, she re-joined the others by the fire ensuring she was facing the exact spot her sister lay.‘What is the plan when we get to the wastes?’ Niall asked quietly, his eyes on Ayda.Ayda shook her head, ‘I don’t know. I just want her away from here.’‘Is that for the best? All the Guards in the Castle were dead, someone must have helped her, and how was that Castle brought down?’ Niall pointed out. She hadn’t thought of that. If she and Elle were so alone how on earth did fifty or so Guards die in that Castle and who did destroy the Castle? Elle certainly wasn’t capable of that.‘Elle told me something the other night, something happened to her during the Ritual.’ Ayda replied.‘During the Ritual? Was she spoken to?!’ Syren said excitedly.‘I think so, she just said she was scared. I didn’t really understand what she’d fear.’ Ayda shrugged looking at Syren. Niall, Theo and Karl looked confused.‘Excuse me, but what the hell is the Ritual?’ Niall asked, looking at them with interest.‘Did she say why she was scared? Do you have any ideas?’ Syren asked Ayda, ignoring him.‘She wanted to tell me, I know she did, but my Father warned her not to, I think.’ Ayda rubbed her temple trying to remember every detail of the night. She was so exhausted, her legs and back aching from riding.‘I can’t believe the Elders spoke to her. Her first Ritual.’ Syren said quietly in disbelief.‘WHAT IS THE RITUAL?’ Niall snapped, looking at them furiously.‘Like we’d tell –’ Syren snapped back, but Ayda had already began explaining.‘The Ritual is a tradition in Myrliar. For centuries our Elders select those of us they deem worthy and summon them to the Ritual.’‘Why?’ Niall asked, still glaring at Syren.‘Those who receive summons meet in the Ritual Chamber beneath the Castle as a way of respect. It is a great honour.’ Ayda finished.‘That’s stupid.’ Niall grunted, disappointed. Karl laughed.‘It’s not stupid!’ Ayda sparked up, ‘My Mother, Father and Elle were all summoned to commune with the Elders!”‘Not you?’ Niall pointed out quickly. Damn him, Ayda thought angrily.‘No, not me.’ Ayda said more to herself than anyone else.‘That’s why it’s stupid. You’re the eldest Princess, the Heir to the Throne and yet they summon Elle and not you? Why? What have you done?’ Niall accused. It hurt. Ayda stood up, she was wrong to have trusted these humans with this knowledge she should have kept it to herself. They were never going to understand the importance of their ways. He had asked her the question she had punished herself with for years and she was not telling anyone that answer. That was her pain, her mistake and her regret.‘She doesn’t need to explain herself to a human!’ Syren spat angrily, standing up in Ayda’s defence.‘And what actually happens in this chamber?!’ Niall continued ignoring Syren.‘We don’t know – we don’t go in do we?’ Syren hissed. Ayda ignored him, her heart aching under the heavy strain of loss and emptiness, she curled up next to Elle and listened whilst Syren and Niall continued to bicker until Theo stepped in to end it. Ayda watched her young sister and wondered how much she had heard, she looked as though she was contentedly sleeping, but she knew better, neither of them would sleep well tonight.She was running, she had never run so fast in her life. Niall was there running with her, Syren ahead of her with Theo and Karl behind. They were screaming for Elle. Elle? She thought desperately, where are you? No?! Ayda was shouting with them and running, her legs were screaming with pain, but she ignored them she had to find Elle. Elle! She called desperately, hysteria rising. Her friends were now running of into the distance, her body cried out as she pushed herself to catch up. She heard cries of pain and shouts ahead, her friends needed her! She was running so fast now, she couldn’t see them, she called their names whilst still searching for Elle. Her breathing was harsh and quick, panic was setting in. She stopped, spinning around on the spot she cried out desperately. It was going to catch her, she could hear it behind her, approaching fast. Where were they?! She screamed as something tapped her on the shoulder, she spun around and saw Elle stood there, blood down the front of her nightdress.‘I’m sorry Ayda.’ She cried, tears running down her face, ‘it’s all my fault!’. Ayda felt a jolt and someone calling her name, Theo? She looked around for him, turning back, Brielle had disappeared, she opened her eyes.‘Sorry Ayda, you were being quite loud, but we need to get going now.’ Theo said kindly as he gently shook her awake. Her heart was hammering against her ribs and her breathing was shallow. She sighed, she knew she wasn’t going to get a good couple of hours sleep and they had a long day ahead of them, she didn’t need nightmares disturbing her sleeping moments and her thoughts haunting her when awake. Rubbing her eyes, she began to pack up the blankets, attaching the previous owners’ saddlebag she spotted Elle with the horses.‘Morning,’ She greeted her sister.‘Ayda I –’ Elle began.‘Good Morning! I have brought you some clean clothes!’ Niall announced, oblivious to the interruption. ‘Well not new, I have borrowed them for our good cause.’ He chuckled to himself as he held up some cream linen tunic and green trousers for Elle. He grinned broadly, clearly pleased with himself for finding them. Elle took the clothes from him with a small ‘thanks’ and disappeared to change.‘Great. Just great.’ Ayda uttered.‘What?’ Niall said aghast, ‘What have I done now?’‘She was about to talk to me!’ Ayda replied angrily.‘I – I’m sorry! I didn’t realise!’ He spluttered, ‘I just wanted to help!’‘Don’t you always!’ Ayda hissed before storming back to the camp to check on everyone.That stupid man, she thought. Elle could have been about to tell her something important, an answer to a question and he interrupted. And for what? Some farm boy’s outfit? She caught sight of Elle with Syren, who was plaiting her hair in a similar fashion to her own, so it wasn’t in the way. Ayda walked over to them. Elle looked up at her. She looked lost, lost in her own thoughts and memories. No doubt haunted by the events that have terrified her. Ayda could see she was going to need more time than they had.‘Elle, what happened yesterday?’ Ayda asked softly, taking her hand and leading her over to their horse. The Princess looked up at her and shook her head.‘I’m scared Ayda, you should have left me there.’ Elle whispered sadly. Solemnly, without another word Elle mounted the horse without help and waited for Ayda to climb on behind her. Once everyone was seated they moved.‘I would never have left you there.’ Ayda said firmly into Brielle’s ear. Brielle said nothing further, she sighed and gazed ahead. The companions pressed forwards. The sun was not yet up but they could see. Theo and Karl had gone to great efforts to ensure that the camp and fire were cleared and that there was nothing remaining to track. Ayda could only hope it was enough. The night’s rest had done its job. The horses were refreshed, and the riders were stronger and more cheerful. Niall and his friends were continuing their long prose, Ayda found it surprising how much the three of them had to discuss. Ayda and Elle however, were not much changed. Brielle was still silent, apparently Niall and Theo’s jokes and games were not enough to bring her out of her stupor which was not surprising as Syren found them downright annoying.‘Are we really going to have to put up with them?’ Syren muttered to Ayda in passing, ducking as Niall attempted to poke her with a stick aimed for her cheek.‘With the rest of you all miserable it’s our duty to provide some relief!’ Niall said mockingly, poking Theo in the arm with his treasured stick and winking at Elle. Ayda had to admit, watching the men chasing each other with sticks and occasionally racing and play jousting was quite amusing. She appreciated the gesture. At first, she was as annoyed as Syren, but she realised they were acting up to try and ease Elle out of her despair. A few times Niall and Theo attempted to get Elle involved by poking her or asking for her favours before ‘battle’, Elle participated, but begrudgingly. The journey through the forest was uneventful, Ayda found herself treasuring the moments of peace knowing that they were surely not meant to last. Watching Niall and Theo had loosened the weights around her heart and she felt lighter, more hopeful, but she could not rid herself of the nagging worry clinging onto her with sharp claws. Elle still had not stirred, the little Princess at the Castle would have revelled in the games of these two Fiends, but she seemed uninterested. Ayda knew that whatever her concerns were, Elle was hiding something dark, deep within her soul and she had to help her, she had to share the burden that was eating away at her childhood. At last, by late morning they reached the edge of the forest. Ahead of them were lush green fields spread miles ahead of them, canvassing the land all around them. Niall let out a long whistle.‘It’s going to be hard to hide out there.’ He said.‘Well what do you suggest? There’s no other way to the wastes.’ Ayda replied.‘The River Myr?’ Theo asked, looking to Karl.‘We could follow the River north, but it will take longer, and they will most likely be watching the bridges.’ Karl agreed, rubbing his chin. Ayda was perplexed, the Wastes had felt like the safest place because no one ever travelled there. There was no green, no water and it was almost uninhabitable except for a small abandoned village. Ayda had forgotten that the journey there was going to be difficult to make undetected. She had no idea who she could trust. Even the people who greeted her with such enthusiasm on their Royal Progress could now be her enemy, she had to be smart and find a way around. Looking over the landscape ahead of her she took in the beauty of her country. The edge of the forest was a top a slight hill, she was lucky to have the vantage of looking down and plotting a course. She spied several small white stone settlements spotted over the fields, they would need to avoid those. Finally, she came up with a plan.‘From here we can see miles around us,’ She said clearly, ‘I suggest we move from high ground to high ground, there are several small hillsides where we can scour the landscape for the safest route. We should be able to see an army or hunting party from these.’ She pointed out the mounds of earth she was aiming for. The other’s nodded.‘It seems like a plan where a lot could go wrong, but I don’t see another option.’ Niall responded thoughtfully.‘It’s the best we’ve got.’ Theo agreed.‘In that case, I’ll meet you at the first one.’ Syren said, turning her horse away.‘What do you mean? Where are you going?’ Ayda turned to face her.‘Right now, we are travelling blind, we have no idea where our enemies are, what they know or who they are,’ Syren replied, ‘I intend to find out.’‘How?’ Ayda asked, worried.‘Inns and Taverns are always the best place for gossip.’ Niall explained. Syren nodded in agreement.‘Can I come?’ Niall asked eagerly.‘No.’‘I won’t get in your way, I’d just, um… have a drink?’‘No. Even if I wanted you with me you’d only be killed on sight.’ Syren ended the conversation impatiently. Bidding farewell to the Princesses she rode down the hill, Ayda watched as she hid her blades and placed her hood over her hair and made in the direction of the closest Town. Please get back safely, Ayda prayed.‘I think she’s starting to like me,’ Niall said happily, ‘she wouldn’t have even considered me before, now she’s concerned for my wellbeing.’‘I don’t think that’s what she was getting at mate,’ Theo thumped Niall’s shoulder laughing. Karl shook his head smirking at them. Kicking her horse forward, Ayda led them on. Down the hillside they plodded away from the forest, out into the open, the sun was nearly at its peak, blazing warmth down upon them. Ayda couldn’t help feeling cold. She couldn’t help remembering the last time her closest friend disappeared to help her, only that time he didn’t return. She couldn’t even say or think of his name anymore. There were cuts born of guilt so deep in her heart they would never be removed. He had died for her. She desperately wished Syren wouldn’t join him. For miles around them, the fields were lush and green, wild flowers of all colours and sizes were blossoming in the sun, big ancient trees stood tall amidst saplings born years ago, branches and leaves from smaller trees straining to keep up. Ayda watched with her sister as hundreds of birds danced and pirouetted across the sky forming waves upon waves of wings glistening with the sun. On they rode, taking in the natural splendour of the fertile land around them. Even Niall and Theo were silent, soaking up the peace, relishing the warm afternoon sun on their cold faces. On they walked for the rest of the day, every so often one of the humans would leave them, circle back and then re-join the party to make sure they weren’t being followed. Ayda’s thoughts were with her friend, she hoped more than anything that Syren would return to her. She had lost too many loved ones, the dull ache of her parent’s death and the memory of her father’s lifeless body would haunt her for the rest of her life, she couldn’t bear to add Syren to the pain. They walked on all day with no problems or encounters, and as the sun began to set they were nearing the top of the view point they had decided to rest upon. There wasn’t as much cover as Ayda had hoped, finding a small cluster of trees she went about setting Elle’s bed whilst the others took advantage of the remaining light to scout the area and spot anyone approaching from the hillside.Slowly night took hold. It was a beautiful night, mild and clear. Excusing themselves from the conversation being held by Niall and Karl, Ayda and Elle lay on the soft grass watching the stars overhead. Ayda took comfort in the small pinpricks of light penetrating the deep black sea above them. They looked close but when she reached out to touch one they were out of reach. Ayda allowed her mind to wander as her little sister admired the moonlight that rained down on them. She had not had time to think in peace without the feeling of unease or ache from travelling in her muscles, the thoughts in her head were so jumbled and confusing, like little jigsaw pieces she hadn’t had time to fit into place. She decided to start at the beginning. The Ritual. What had scared Elle so much at the Ritual? She had been spoken to, Elle had told her that much, but she didn’t know what was said that scared her. Then there was the attack on her. Her own comrades and Soldiers who she had trained with and fought with so many times, had turned on her. Betrayed her family, killed her Father and presumably her Mother and somehow succeeded in bringing down a centuries old Castle? She needed to know who had given these orders and whose authority was so absolute it went against the King himself. Who wanted her family killed – and why? Ayda knew that her little sister could probably provide the answers to most – if not all the questions, but her silence had continued all day.Ayda turned her head to look at her sister’s face. She could see long streams of glistening tears running down the Princesses face and getting lost in her blonde hair. She squeezed her hand in comfort.‘Do you think Mother and Father are up there?’ Elle whispered softly in her small girlish voice. Ayda looked up at the stars again. Pointing at the brightest one she replied,‘They are the brightest stars and always watching us.’ Ayda smiled slightly, taking comfort in the star that shone so brightly, Ayda realised that she was now watching the star and could see her Father smiling down on them. Suddenly she felt stronger, more able to do what she needed to do. He was watching them, and he would protect them.‘He died for me.’ Elle whispered sadly, the star reflecting brightly in her watery gaze.‘What do you mean?’ Ayda replied, holding her breath.‘The bad man wanted me, but Father wouldn’t let him.’‘What bad man? Wanted you why?’ Ayda sat up quickly, breathing fast she gave Elle time to reply.‘He-he was wearing a red cloak and gold mask. He tried to kill me.’ Elle said feebly.‘The Legion?!’ Ayda exclaimed flabbergasted. The Legion were the Guards of the Elders. They were very rarely seen as they usually stayed with their Masters. In fact, Ayda could not recall a time anyone had ever seen them, her Father nor Mother had ever seen them, they were only known to people through the teachings of the Scholars, many thought them a myth. Why would they want to kill Brielle? Why would the Elder’s want to kill Brielle? If this was true, what chance did they have against the most elite soldiers and the only mages left in the world?‘Elle, what scared you at the Ritual?’ She asked calmly, it would not do to let Elle see how worried she was. Elle sat up and shook her head slowly.‘Father said –’‘Father’s dead. If I’m going to protect you, I need to know everything,’ Ayda said firmly. She felt guilty for the words and for the tears brimming in her young sister’s eyes, but the truth was the truth and she had to know what the Princess knew, their lives depended on finding out why they were being hunted.‘I heard a woman,’ Elle whispered almost inaudibly, as though keeping the secret from the air around them, ‘She told me to get out. She was scared.’‘This girl – she wasn’t an Elder?’ Ayda asked confused. Elle shook her head profusely. Great, Ayda thought, this didn’t answer any questions and just added to the list of things she didn’t know. So, who was the girl and why did she want to get Elle out of the Ritual Chamber, nothing made sense. The only connection she could see was the Elders, but she had no idea what to do about that, she couldn’t demand they speak with her. They both sat in silence, both trapped in their own thoughts. Both searching for answers to questions. Sometime after, Niall came and found them, and they returned to the camp and got ready for a rough night’s sleep.‘Did she tell you anything?’ Niall asked quietly after Ayda came back from settling Elle down for the night. Ayda started to answer when they heard a distinct crack of a twig. The four of them jumped up quickly, weapons drawn, Ayda’s eyes were straining to see ahead of them in the dark. Slowly and quietly they moved towards sleeping Elle.‘Who’s there?’ Niall asked loudly, even though he was trying his best to sound confident she could hear the nervous waiver in his voice.‘Stand down it’s only me.’ Replied a familiar voice. Syren had re-joined them. Ayda breathed a silent sigh of relief. She was back. She was safe. Well safer.‘How did you know where we were?’ Niall spat, cursing her for making him jump.‘I didn’t, I’ve been wandering this hilltop for a while, it was only when I heard you that I knew where you were.’ Syren said quietly.‘Did anyone follow you?’ Karl asked gruffly.‘No and I’m fine thank you for asking.’ Syren said impatiently. Ayda clapped her on the shoulder.‘Good to see you,’ Ayda said gently, ‘Any news?’ The five of them sat down again not far from Elle. Syren started rummaging around in a bag and pulled out a loaf of bread, some fruit and cold meats. The others groaned thanks as they tucked in to the meal. Ayda had only just noticed the ache of hunger in the pit of her stomach and went to give Elle some of the food before returning to the small but merry feast. They hadn’t eaten much all day, just occasional fruit they picked going through the fields.‘I took the liberty of getting some food for the journey, but we’ll have to ration it, I couldn’t take too much without arousing suspicion.’ Syren said through a mouthful of hard bread. They ate in silence, each relishing every mouthful until the food in front of them was devoured.‘The Stone City has fallen.’ Syren said bitterly. Ayda looked at her and waited for her to continue. ‘The attack on the Stone City is the talk of the village. It is rumoured that the Legion have pulled out everyone from their homes looking for Elle. There are also scouts searching for you.’‘What of my people?’ Ayda asked. She remembered the times when her family would go on progress through Myrliar, her people were always so happy to see them, they would throw flowers and sing songs of love and peace, she had forgotten that in this struggle for power, everyone would be affected.‘The Legion have turned people out on the streets and forbidden anyone to aid you. Some have come out to support you and have been flayed for it. Young girls have been taken from their parents and examined to make sure they’re not your sister. Families that resist or hinder any search are killed on the spot.’ Syren said all this quickly as if to rid herself of the taste of it on her tongue. Ayda could not bear to think of the families being torn apart and all the blood shed on the white stone floors of her City.‘Who oversees Myrliar now?’ Ayda asked with a heavy heart.‘The Captain of the Legion apparently.’ Syren replied.‘Why have they done this? Why have they overturned my family, ours was a reign of peace!’ Ayda fumed, her blood boiling, the injustice and terror of everything that had happened to her family and country were too much to bear, and she was still no closer to getting any answers.‘The Legion are controlled by the Elders you say?’ Niall asked quietly.‘Yes, they are sworn guardians of the Elders.’ Ayda nodded.‘And the Ritual connects you Elves with the Elders?’ He asked. Ayda nodded again, curious.‘So, if Elle was scared after the Ritual, maybe she saw something she wasn’t meant to?’ Niall suggested, palms open in offering.‘And the girl telling Elle to get out?’ Ayda asked hopefully. Syren’s confused face looked between them, and Ayda brought her up to speed on what Elle had shared.‘The girl warned her, she knew the Elders would find out?’ Niall said, unsure of his own thoughts. Ayda had come to the same theory in her mind. The secret seemed to lay with Elle, but she was sure her sister had now told her everything.‘How on earth did someone communicate with Elle telepathically?’ Syren asked, bewildered.Ayda had been asking herself the same question. She had heard of this skill before, but no one had the power to do it for centuries.‘Magic.’ Came a quiet voice, Elle had woken and sat next to them without anyone realising.‘Impossible.’ Ayda said rather too quickly, slightly concerned that the young girl had gotten to them without any of them hearing anything.Niall laughed, ‘Magic? Are you serious?’‘You humans have never had magic?’ Syren asked curiously.‘No, never.’ Theo snorted, unsure whether it was a joke.‘Elves and Humans possessed powerful magic thousands of years ago, but through blood lines over time, it dwindled out, no one has ever seen, possessed or practised magic in centuries,’ Ayda told them, ‘We were brought up on history over the years, mages were present on both sides in the Great War that engulfed our people.’‘The Ritual is believed to be a chance for Elves to regain their magic and knowledge through communing with the Elders.’ Elle added, Syren was shaking her head at Ayda, she still didn’t trust the humans with the secrets of Myrliar. In the distance a howl could be heard, ghost like and clear as the stars above. It didn’t sound very close, so the companions took it as a cue to get some rest, with Karl on first watch. Ayda curled up once again around her sister, ready for fitful sleep.‘Ayda, Ayda...’Ayda shrugged off the hands that were annoying her, she couldn’t have been asleep that long. Just a little longer, there was another day of travelling ahead and she was still aching from the day before.She drifted back off to sleep. A sharp pain in the leg woke her and she cried out loud as she awoke.‘What the hell –’ She began to shout, but someone put a hand over her mouth, she struggled against them, not being completely awake she panicked, until she saw Elle just in front of her urging her to quiet down.‘Will you shut up?’ Niall spat in her ear. She nodded furiously, and he let her go.‘The howling is closer, we think the wolves are near our campsite.’ Syren explained coolly. Ayda sighed, there goes their night’s rest.‘Elle get up a tree, will you?’ Ayda said to her sister pointing at the closest one.‘Good idea. Princess, go on.’ Theo pushed her gently. With some help from the other’s Elle managed to shimmy up the tree and behind the leaves, out of sight. Ayda relaxed a little, the wolves would never get her up there, shame they weren’t built for more people. The howling sent goosebumps up her back. The hairs all over her body stood tall and alert. She was very aware of the sudden drop in temperature, as her lungs filled with ice and her breath caught in her chest. Ayda saw the others in front of her, circling her with their weapons raised. Karl with his broadsword stood like a giant over the others, Theo and Syren with their twin swords poised and Niall with his sword loosely at his side. Ayda unsheathed her own sword, she had taken down wolves before on Patrol, this shouldn’t be too difficult she reasoned calming herself. Unless there’s too many. The howling grew closer, they were nearly upon them. Something didn’t feel right, Ayda thought, the other’s in front were nervously looking around, their breath fogging in the moonlight. They had all encountered wolves before, but the growl of these wolves was, ghostly. A gritty, rough growling sounded all around them, glass twinkling through the dark.They were here. Ayda prepared her sword, and held it outstretched in front of her as the wolves ripped through the undergrowth. Several of her allies cursed loudly as they saw what was tearing towards them. A flash of silver fur and red eyes approached as wolves the size of lions hurtled towards them, growling in anticipation. Ayda watched in horror as one of the monsters leapt at her red-haired friend, who neatly rolled over to slice its underbelly as it flew overhead. Ayda had to admire her friend’s skill. The wolf, though hurt, did not stop there, it flew at her snapping at her as Syren pummelled it repeatedly with her blades. These were not normal wolves Ayda realised. Their silver fur was glowing in the moonlight and their red eyes were filled with an all-consuming bloodlust. Ayda jumped in to stab the monster repeatedly, together Ayda and Syren finished it off, just as another appeared growling. Ayda turned and saw four wolves attacking the humans. Niall, Theo and Karl were impressive, each one fluent in their dance, each of them understanding the other, when one struck, the other defended. As Karl landed a killing blow across the throat of a monster, Niall smacked another in the head to block its attack. The wolves were strong, and had razor sharp teeth and claws, but they were slow, they had to use this to their advantage. On and on they fought together, the five of them huddled as close together as possible, their resolve frightening, as they roared louder than the wolves. More and more wolves approached.‘We – can’t – keep this – going – forever!’ Syren screamed breathlessly as she slid her blade into the roof of a wolf’s mouth. ‘Aargh!’ She cried with pain, Ayda looked around and saw blood seeping from a fresh slice in her friend’s arm. The allies were all sporting their own cuts and wounds, they were slowly being ripped apart, and they would not last much longer before they tired from the onslaught of monsters. A thud on the ground shook her as she watched Theo fall backwards crying in pain, clutching his leg, Ayda saw a nasty bite mark shedding blood beneath his linens, he cursed loudly. Niall hacked off the wolf’s head with several blows, spilling blackened blood on the ground before returning with Karl to defend their brother. Time was running out, they were one down, Ayda was sure soon others would fall. Jumping aside Ayda timed a perfect hit as she slashed the side of a wolf. Too late, she realised she had pushed herself into the path of another that had thrown itself at her. Her chest felt as though it had been crushed under a pile of rock, claws were digging into her shoulders as the beast pressed her into the ground. Its teeth were mere inches from her skin gnashing together waiting for the taste of her blood. Using all her strength she pushed the wolf away from her, it was no use, it was too strong.‘Ayda!’ Niall bellowed. She heard the shouts of her friends around her, daring a look she could see they would never get to her in time, they were still struggling with their own beasts. She pushed with all her remaining strength, struggling to keep the teeth from her throat, the wolf thrashing around snapping its jaws angrily. Struggling she realised she was losing. A high-pitched shriek sounded across the hill. The world around her flashed a brilliant red and yellow, as flames scorched the air, Ayda strained a look above her. What she saw stopped her heart. Elle had climbed down from the tree to aid them, her arms were stretched wide and strings of flames were firing from her hands, white hot and blazing, snaking their way around the wolves before her. One by one the wolves howled in pain. The smell of burning flesh reached Ayda as the flames burnt holes like snakes through their bodies. Some fled but did not get far before Elle’s flames torched them into ash. Ayda wept as she watched her little sister’s face, grim determination was sketched across every feature. Her eyes were black and strained. She looked older, so much older. The wolf bearing down on Ayda burned internally and collapsed onto Ayda, who with her last breath looked at Elle and realised with shock, her sister was a Mage.",

      "content": "8 – ELLEThe fire had roared through her very soul, fed by her fear and anger as she stood watching her sister flailing beneath the silver beast. The world had burnt away. She had focussed every grain of her power on finishing the creatures who threatened her friends. Her whole body was shaking as her power ebbed, and slowly she fell to her knees, weakened and exhausted. The fire dissipated as quickly as it was conjured. Brielle watched as Niall, Karl and Syren heaved the great silver beast off her sister and dragged her closer to the trees. Ayda was unconscious, Elle felt a shiver of cold sweep through as she crawled on her hands and knees to her side. Taking her sister’s hand, she pleaded weakly for her to come back to her. She could feel the other’s watching her, fearing her. Niall and Karl moved away to help Theo limp over to them, where they bandaged up the bite on his leg.‘You could have blasted them before I got bitten you know,’ Theo laughed weakly, winking at her. He couldn’t hide his pain, he winced as Karl tightened the bandage around his wound. They sat in silence for a short while, each recovering from the fight and the display of power they had witnessed.‘You were almost a waste of rations there my old friend!’ Niall laughed, patting Theo on the leg. Elle couldn’t take her eyes off Ayda. She was the only family she had left. Theo was right, she should have helped them earlier, but she was so afraid. She could hardly remember the last time she used magic, all she could remember was the darkness and pain. Would Ayda still love her if she knew this was all her fault?‘You should’ve told me.’ Ayda said weakly. Elle’s heart skipped a beat as she saw her sister’s eyes open slowly, she jumped in and hugged her tight.‘I’m sorry.’ Elle whimpered, crying into her sister’s clothes. Ayda sat up against the tree and surveyed the landscape, the sun was on its way. The wolves had disappeared.‘I guess now we know why the Elders are after you.’ Niall said, sitting down next to Ayda. Ayda sighed, she was out of her depth, she had no idea how to deal with magic.‘But, we haven’t seen magic in centuries, surely the Elders would be glad to see it back?’ Syren said. Elle thought back to the attack at the Castle, painfully she remembered her Father using magic to the surprise of everyone else. She wasn’t the first to have magic, there must be others too. Something else bubbled to the surface of her memory.‘The Legion said something about breaking rules and that no-one is allowed magic.’ Elle informed them, as the memory appeared clear in her mind.‘I guess they’re not pleased then.’ Niall said gruffly, rubbing his temple.‘Elle, I can’t believe you didn’t tell us this earlier, this changes things.’ Ayda repeated with slight annoyance in her tone. Brielle winced at the underlying tone. She had wanted to tell her sister. Desperately. But with everything else that had happened she didn’t know what to do. It felt like she was living in a nightmare, she found herself hoping that she would wake up soon and be looking forward to playing with her friends in the Castle Gardens. Every time she thought about the beautiful Castle and Gardens and her dear friends her heart clenched tightly. They were gone, it was all gone, she had destroyed it all. Not the Legion, not the Elders. Her. She had pleaded with her mind to forget her Father, Mother, Amie and her friends. But no matter how she locked them away in her mind, they were still forever heavy in her heart.‘Princess, what exactly can you do with this power of yours?’ Theo asked kindly, placing his hand on her arm as he leaned over from his resting spot beside them. His leg was cleaned and wrapped firmly in bandages, she was relieved to see he seemed to be getting over the shock.‘I - I don’t know,’ Elle answered shyly. ‘I have only done it twice, and I don’t ever remember deciding to. It just happens.’‘Try something now.’ Theo urged enthusiastically. Ayda nodded. Brielle was unsure. She wasn’t confident it worked like that. Everything that had happened had just happened, she hadn’t been aware of releasing her magic, or forming it, it had just appeared. And destroyed. Elle was conscious that both times her magic had exploded, death and destruction blossomed. She had destroyed their home and killed most of its residents and she had almost set fire to this forest. Refusing their request, she took in the look of their faces. They were all dirty and tired, most now had skin hidden beneath cuts and grazes but beyond that, in each of them she saw a deep fear. They were afraid of her, she guessed. Before, they were protecting a little girl, a Princess, now they were travelling with a Mage of unknown strength and control. Something that none of them had even known possible.‘What happened the first time Elle?’ Ayda asked gently, as if she knew this was the cause of the girl’s pain. Elle closed her eyes, she had to tell them the truth, they were risking their lives by helping her, she owed it to them. She didn’t want to, she couldn’t bear it again. Taking a deep breath, she started her story. The words flowed easily once she started, it felt like a relief being able to share the weight of her anchor with her friends. They listened intently, when she revealed her Father’s use of magic, Ayda had lowered her head into her hands, but not before Elle saw sorrow exchange for anger. When she reached the end of the tale, a few long sighs were heard. They sat in silence for a long while, each contemplating what had just been said.‘Niall, we’re in over our heads here,’ Karl stated firmly, ‘I can’t fight magic, if I hadn’t just seen it I would have laughed at the idea of it. We don’t need to be here.’‘So, you’re just going to leave?’ Syren said hotly.‘You have to understand, we have never even heard of magic before this, it’s a lot to take in.’ Theo soothed.‘There were human Mages too, you know!’ Syren replied.‘Not that we know of. How do you know?’‘Do you know nothing of the history of our two people?’ Syren spat.‘Well, a bit, we’ve been warring for centuries, heavy losses on both sides, because the Elves wanted our land.’ Theo said nervously, wavering under Syren’s glare.‘That’s NOT what it was about! You Humans constantly crossed the Myr River into our lands and attacked, raped and pillaged our people!’ Syren spat, her eyes were growing redder and redder in anger. Theo raised his hands in defeat, in his weakened state he didn’t have much energy to argue. Elle looked to her sister to step in, but her head was still down, and Niall was watching something in the distance, apparently unaware of the war brewing in their camp.‘Mages were conscripted into both armies, where they slaughtered each other, destroying Elven Land. Their numbers were so diminished that eventually their blood lines died out. The only Mages left were the Elders. Since there have been no more Elven Mages, and clearly no more Human Mages either.’ Syren informed them bluntly.‘We need to move.’ Ayda said, her head snapping back up. Without another word she wandered off into the trees in the direction of the horses. Syren followed with a backwards glare at the men left behind.‘Are you coming?’ Elle asked timidly.‘Princess, this is not our fight. I don’t know what we can do to help you – you just saved us!’ Theo said sadly shaking his head. Elle looked to Niall, she wanted them to stay. She felt sure that they would be needed, she was scared that Ayda and Syren would not be enough protection if her magic failed, and she didn’t have any confidence in it. She hated it, despised its flow in her veins, her father might still be alive, and her home would be standing if she wasn’t a Mage.‘Be honest with me Princess, you don’t think you can control it do you?’ Niall asked, rising to his feet, Elle stood with him and looked him in the eye. She knew that Syren disliked this man, she didn’t like the way he played the fool or his jokes, she didn’t trust him. Elle thought otherwise, she had watched him with her sister, the way he had followed her into the Castle, and screamed for her when she was hurt. He had been kind to Elle, trying to make her laugh and helping her with the horses and clean clothes. Brielle believed he was a kind and caring man hidden beneath bravado. It was something she noticed that her sister could not see.‘No. I’m scared I will fail and my sister will fall like my Father,’ Elle said truthfully, tears stinging her eyes. It was her worst fear, losing the last member of her family. Her cherished sister, the sister who had fought for her so many times. Niall nodded, understanding. He looked to the sky, the sun had appeared, a red hue was glowing in the landscape as morning began.‘I will come with you,’ He said firmly and confidently, taking the young Elf’s hand in his.‘Niall, what? This is ridiculous!’ Karl grunted in disbelief, ‘You’re risking our lives for Elves? Theo is already hurt, we need to go back!’‘You two go, if you wish, I’m needed here.’‘No. You will die. The Elf cannot even control her magic!’ Karl shouted, not believing what he was hearing.‘Precisely! Who will help them if her magic fails? Ayda and Syren will not be enough! And what of our people – our own heritage?’ Niall said loudly and clearly.‘Why do you care so much!?’ Silence followed, Niall didn’t so much as look at his friends. Theo broke the silence as he struggled to rise from his spot alone and catch his footing on the uneven ground. He nodded at Niall and ruffed Elle’s hair as he limped passed them, following Ayda to the horses. He was coming.‘Please Karl,’ Elle pleaded quietly. Karl growled to himself, he looked at the Princess and his harsh gaze softened. Brielle understood his fear, he didn’t know which was more likely to kill him first, the Legion, The Elder’s or her lack of control. He had been fighting all his life, but with magic as his adversary, he was lost. Defeated, he nodded and followed Theo. Niall looked down at Elle.‘See? We’re a good team,’ He winked at her. ‘I’m sorry for getting you all into this.’ Elle said.‘Do not be afraid to fail, failing makes you stronger. With me here you have nothing to fear!’ He smiled at her, gave her a squeeze and they followed on.Ayda had already started on her horse when they arrived so Brielle elected to sit astride Niall’s black stallion. He was a beautiful horse, with a glossy pure black coat and what were white socks had they not been covered in dirt and sludge from travelling. She was thankful that the wolves had not been interested in the horses, they had left them away from the camp for fear of detection, it was lucky they had, it would be a long way on foot. Brielle noticed her sister was not talking to anyone, not even her dearest friend, she guessed it was her fault. She shared her concerns with her co-rider.‘It’s a lot to take in, you were brought up on magical history stories with the knowledge that no more magic existed in your country. Then she finds out that her sister and her father both have magic and that the Elder’s you have worshipped for so long are hunting you,’ Niall explained softly.‘I shouldn’t have kept it from her.’ Elle whispered guiltily.‘Maybe, maybe not. I don’t blame you for that, and I’m sure she doesn’t. You’re so young, it’s cruel that this has happened to you.’ The group continued through the miles of fields, the sun was up now, radiating golden light upon the landscape. Elle watched as Ayda continued to lead at the front, not speaking to anyone. She was leading them north, towards the Wastes where she felt certain there would be no one to intercept her. The countryside was populated by farmers and a few small towns and villages, Ayda was giving each of them a wide berth, not knowing who friend or foe was, she could not risk anyone recognising them. It would be better to reach the wastes unnoticed, so they were harder to track. They had eaten on the move, Brielle had seen the look on Karl’s face when he was handed a pitifully small ration compared to the other’s, thankfully he didn’t complain aloud, merely grumbled as he popped it miserably into his mouth in one. Elle didn’t want to hear another shouting match between him and Syren, she felt there was so much more going on than their differences. She found herself longing for Ayda to speak to her, although Niall was fun and cheerful company, as he was telling her more stories about his childhood, Elle wished she could feel her sister’s warm words of encouragement. Noticing the dark cloud slowly shadowing Elle’s mood, Niall burst into song, joyfully mocking his friend’s pain.‘There once was a one-legged man,He fell off from his horse,He hopped, skipped and jumped,And wobbled when he dumped,All his friends were laughing,Theo is a one-legged man,His blades were overcome,The dog wanted meat,And got his smelly feet,Theo started howling,Niall is a very brave manHe saved his friend from death,He stabbed with his bladeAnd the dog did fadeA Knight in Armour Shining!’Brielle found his laughter contagious, throughout the song he could hardly keep us his performance through laughter as he saw the look of feigned hurt from Theo. By the end, the two of them were in fits of hysterics, Elle could not help but join in. For a wonderful fleeting moment, she felt light, she felt young and unencumbered. The memory of her Father was distant, the deep worry that ate at her was forgotten. She had forgotten that through the darkness that surrounded her at times of despair, her friends around her were beacons of hope. With them she felt stronger and happier. She glanced at Ayda and was relieved to see the smallest of smiles on her face and a flash of relief in her eyes. Her sister would never neglect her and never leave her, she was all she had left in the world. Together, they were a formidable team, they only had each other to lose and it would take a lot to tear them apart now.‘Thank you, Niall,’ Elle whispered to him, she felt him gently squeeze her. She was grateful to him for reminding her not to wallow in her self-pity, through his stories and those of his friends she could see that he was a loyal and fierce friend, which explained why his closest friends, Karl and Theo, had followed him all this way. Ayda was still indifferent to him, and Syren did everything she could to ignore the three of them. The hatred and resentment seemed to run deep in her veins. The young Princess knew that Humans and Elves naturally hated one another, due to the centuries of war that had ripped their world in two, but the hatred seemed so much more pronounced with Ayda and Syren. Elle could not bring herself to hate the three of them just for being human, they were risking their lives to help them. They were her friends, not her enemies.‘Your Country is so like ours, Princess,’ Theo said, pulling his horse back alongside Niall’s.‘In what way?’ Elle asked intrigued, she found herself wanting to visit their home, and see more of these people.‘The flowers, the animals, the land.’‘Are there any differences?’‘Yes of course, the people are different, your beliefs, your traditions, and your buildings are a funny shape.’ Theo winked at her.‘Do you not have Elders like us?’ Elle asked curiously.‘No, we have our Spirit God, but he only serves to advise King Devan, many of us don’t believe in him. I’ve never even seen a depiction of him.’ Theo explained briefly. Elle had heard of the human King. His Father and the Kings before him had a circle of advisors which worked similarly to their Monarchy in Myrliar. Her own Father had counsel from the Elders whereas King Devan received counsel from his advisors. His advisors were human, but rumour was there was a God at the Head of the Council that Kings always heeded. Many humans believed this a mere fabrication or superstition for no one had ever seen or heard this God.‘I don’t think the people are so different. We are all unique, but all the same.’ Elle said quietly to herself. He looked at her, his eyebrow raised in curiosity. ‘You love, you trust, you bleed, you believe, you hope,’ Elle explained, ‘I think we are not so different.’ Theo’s mouth opened in surprise, he ran his fingers through her hair and murmured softly.‘You are a special one, Princess. In all my years I have never heard such wisdom, especially in one so young.’‘The Princess is too young to know war,’ A dark voice called, Syren had been listening into their conversation, ‘when she has lost her whole family at the hands of humans she would feel the pain of the rest of us.’‘We have lost our family to war, yet the humans have had no hand in it.’ Ayda said clearly and loudly, stopping Syren in her tracks. Syren glared at Theo and Niall then quickly spurred her horse to the front next to Ayda.‘Don’t let her thoughts poison you, Princess, you have the greatest heart of all.’ Niall whispered in her ear.‘You do not like Elves either though?’ Elle asked.‘No, as a rule, like Syren, our lives have been torn apart by your people,’ Niall reasoned, ‘But I do not hate, just because one petal of the flower is bruised, does not mean the others are any less beautiful.’ Elle scrunched her face up trying to understand what he meant.‘He means to say, just because one Elf is bad, it is not to say they all are. You certainly aren’t.’ Theo explained. Elle liked that. She pictured the beautiful flowers in her room of the Castle. They were always so beautiful in bloom. Occasionally one would decay and rot, but the others were still pure and splendid, no matter their colour or size, they were each as perfect as the last. She heard the trickle of water underneath Niall and Theo’s conversation. It sounded as if a stream was nearby as they moved further north. She was suddenly very conscious of the stains of sweat and grime on her friend’s and her clothes. She pulled her tunic to her face. It was not the floral scent she was used to as a Princess. She noticed Syren had disappeared from up front, Ayda had pulled back to them.‘Syren has gone to find this water and make sure the way is clear.’ Ayda informed them.The other’s all smiled and nodded, Elle could see the prospect of a nice soak and wash to them was a blessing. The horses could also do with a water stop, they had not been able to spare much of their own supply. Moments later Syren reappeared from a cluster of trees not far from them.‘It’s a small lake, there’s a stream that comes from the mountains. There’s no one there.’ She said, not able to hide the excitement form her voice. Everyone looked at Ayda expectantly.‘Please Ayda.’ Elle begged.‘This is a place many people will travel to for rest.’ Ayda explained her doubts.‘We haven’t washed or bathed in days Ayda, we’ll all feel so much better for it.’ Niall said softly.‘And I’m pretty sure the Princess had blonde hair at one point!’ Theo jested, gently nudging Elle who smiled. Ayda nodded. Several whoops sounded from Niall and Theo. Kicking their horses back into action, the troupe moved quickly towards the small cluster of trees, Elle saw the small trickling stream and revelled in the sound. The water peacefully flowed over the rocks, and clear water glistened in the sunlight. As they reached the small lake, everyone’s moods lightened. Niall helped Elle from her saddle and then raced a limping Theo down to the lake where they both dived headfirst fully clothed.‘Oh, for goodness sake!’ Syren spat, ‘Be quiet, you’ll attract attention!’‘Sorry!’ Niall called over in a shouted whisper. The two of them were splashing around like boys playing in a river. Every now and then one of them would go under the water, reappear and drag the other under. Elle found herself giggling at them as she watched.‘Come over here Elle,’ Ayda summoned. She showed her a shallow section of water hidden behind an assortment of rocks, away from eyes where the young Princess could bathe in peace.‘I’ll wash your clothes,’ Syren offered, taking them as Elle shimmied into the water. Ayda sat against the rock, considering the trees that thinly surrounded the lake. The water was cool against Elle’s sore skin, the cuts and grazes stung slightly but soon numbed in the freshness of the water. Ducking her head into the depths, she began to run her fingers through her messy hair. She decided this was a good opportunity to talk to her sister.‘I’m sorry Ayda.’ Elle said quietly. Ayda sighed.‘It’s OK, it’s a lot to take in, but I understand.’ Elle busied herself washing out the vast amounts of curly, matted, hair. Without a brush she knew she was fighting a losing battle.‘You can’t control it can you?’ Ayda asked.‘No.’ Elle replied. The peacefulness she had felt at sitting in the cool calm lake and hearing the boys laughing and crying in happiness shattered at the thought of her magic.‘Have you tried?’‘No. Every time I have used magic, so many have died.’‘You must be strong, to bring down the castle,’ Ayda figured. Elle nodded. ‘Why did you?’‘Why did I what?’ Elle asked, staring absently into the water.‘Bring down the Castle.’‘I didn’t mean to! I was so angry, Father had just been killed, everything just kind of exploded!’ Elle said loudly, tears filled her eyes, she stood. The tension in her body snapped. She had been desperately trying to clean, trying to relax but she never could. She would never be rid of the horror of her magic. Her magic had been the cause of everything and she hated it. No matter how hard she scrubbed or how long she sat in that water, the magic would never go away. She had to live with it. Ayda wrapped her in the blanket used for sleeping at sat her on the smoothest rocks.‘I’m sorry, don’t be upset, I’m just trying to understand.’ Ayda cooed.‘I hate it Ayda!’ Elle wailed, ‘My magic has destroyed everything! Mother and Father would be alive if the Elder’s didn’t want me!’ Elle felt the anger bubbling beneath her skin, why did no one understand? She was angry with her sister, she couldn’t just give her a few moments of peace without accusing her of choosing to destroy their home!‘I see the way you all look at me! As if I might explode and hurt you! You’re scared of me!’ She continued to shout, her temper getting the better of her. Ayda looked desperately at her sister and tried to calm her down.‘We’re not afraid of you we know you’d never hurt us!’‘You should be afraid! I’m afraid! You should have seen what I did!’ Flashbacks smashed into her brain and assaulted her presence on reality. Her anger spilled over the brim and she was aware of power developing in her chest. Her eyes firing with anger as she glared at her sister, unseeing, drowning in the pit of her anger, her fear. Brielle did not hear her sister beg her to stop and did not hear the other’s crying in pain. She remembered the pain she extracted from her Father’s betrayers. It was what she lived for. She was blind to everything around her, the power had seeped out from within her and was white hot with venom. Her heart was beating fast and her breathing was out of control.‘Elle, stop!’ Ayda screamed. She had never heard Ayda scream like that. The panic and soul shredding fear slapped her in the face. For the first time she could see. Ayda’s face was red hot and her eyes were streaming with tears.‘Elle, stop! Please!” Ayda cried out again. Elle felt her feet on the dirt. She looked around at the lake behind her, the sight she beheld was enough to pull her to her knees. The lake was bubbling and hissing, pillows of steam rose rapidly from the depths, looking closer she saw hundreds of charred fish floating lifelessly on the surface being pushed around by erupting bubbles. She had boiled the lake! She cried and begged for it to stop, but her magic kept coming, flowing through her veins. The lake was hissing furiously, angry bubbles frothing on the surface, steam spiralling high into the sky. Finally, exhausted, she fell shaking to the floor, in floods of warm tears.",

      "content": "9 – AYDAShaking, Ayda dragged her sister’s limp, frail form from the side of the lake and clutched at her.‘Elle, I’m so sorry, forgive me.’ Ayda whispered to her. Elle’s eyes were closed but tears were falling. Heavy droplets of regret splashing the dirt.‘Is – is everyone ok?’ She asked timidly, not daring to open her eyes. Ayda had watched on in fear as she saw the water near Elle slowly bubble, she had called out frantically to the others who thankfully left the lake quicker than she expected.‘We’re OK.’ Niall called out. Ayda could hear the quake in his voice, he couldn’t believe he had nearly been boiled alive. Ayda took a few moments with her sister to compose herself and steady her breathing. It scared her how powerful her little sister was. It scared her that she now knew Elle could not control it. The scariest thing, however, was not knowing how to help. She knew that the Wastes was not going to solve their problems, they needed to find someone urgently to teach Elle. Magic had been gone for centuries – who would know what to do? It hit her quickly, but it was a long shot.‘Elle, the girl that spoke to you in the Ritual – what did she sound like? Did you recognise her?’ Ayda asked urgently. Her heart dropped when Elle looked up and shook her head.‘Do you think she could help us if we could find her?’ Syren asked, bringing fresh clothes over to Elle.‘She’s the only one that we think knows magic other than the Elders.’ Ayda asked.‘But we don’t even know where to start finding her. What about the Temple of Scholars?’‘It’s too dangerous.’ Ayda said firmly.‘They have thousand-year-old records, they must know something of magic.’ Syren coerced.‘But they are in the pocket of the Elders. They are their scholars.’Syren nodded, agreeing, ‘So how do we find this girl? We don’t know her name or what she looks like.’ Ayda had not figured that out yet, it was a big world and they didn’t have any leads. She looked at her companions and felt a bitter spread of guilt. Niall, Theo and Karl were stood, unsure, at a loss themselves. They didn’t need to be here, Ayda thought, they had helped her from the beginning. She would not have got far without them. Theo was sporting a damaged leg that he not once complained of. They were risking their lives for her and Elle and she didn’t know what to do. It was likely they would be killed, and it seemed this was more and more likely to be an accident. She looked at her small sister who finally had the courage to stand and begin to dress amidst her sobs and shakes. How would her sister feel if she accidentally killed someone?‘You should leave us.’ Ayda said unfeelingly to her companions. They all looked at her in shock, except for Niall.‘I knew you were going to say that.’ Niall said sadly, shaking his head.‘She’s right Niall, we are no help in the trials to come.’ Karl said, he looked thrilled at the prospect of going home.‘Why?’ Theo asked weakly, he had decided to lean against a nearby rock, his face was hurt as he looked between the two Princesses.‘You have done us a great service, but I don’t know how much more help you can be without getting in the way.’ Ayda replied, not looking them in the eye.‘What are you going to do?’ Niall asked.‘We’ll figure something out.’‘That’s your plan?’ Niall said in disbelief, ‘We’ve come all this way, and you’re just going to kill yourself out of pity?’‘It’s not pity.’ Ayda replied stubbornly.‘What is it then? You want us to go because we can’t help you, but without us you wouldn’t even be here!’ Niall’s voice was rising. Ayda did not want to express her fear about Elle’s magic, she knew how upset her sister would be, Brielle would take it to heart.‘Yes, we are fighting against the odds! Yes, we are most likely going to die one way or another.’ Niall continued firmly, staring her hard in the face. ‘I want to fight for something that is worth my life, and your sister, Princess Elle is capable of great things, with or without her magic, and I WILL be there for her when she needs me!’‘You can’t! If she can’t protect herself what are we going to do!? She’s stronger than us!’ Ayda snapped.‘There are other types of magic! There is friendship. There is love. That’s what she needs from us. She is still a child.’ Niall finished with a deep breath.‘How is that supposed to help her?’ Ayda said timidly, he was right, she thought, but she wasn’t ready to admit it.‘When her world fills with darkness and her magic can’t save her. We’ll be the light that she needs.’ With that, Niall moved forwards to the trembling Princess. She greeted him a hug as he crouched down to her height. Ayda was defeated, she knew he was right. She had wanted to protect them from risk and save her sister from herself, but her sister needed her friends, and they were so short on them right now.‘I am staying with the Princesses. Karl, Theo, I will not hold it against you if you choose to leave.’‘I don’t know why you ask, we’re always with you brother.’ Theo nodded. Karl grunted his agreement, but disapproval was written on his face. His heart was torn between his home, and the small girl-elf in front of him. They moved on as quickly as possible, Ayda was sure the bellowing steam rising high into the sky was sure to attract the wrong attention. She did not want to be caught out. They had decided it was clear enough to move through the night, they were keen to put distance between themselves and the lake. In her exhaustion Elle had fallen asleep in front of Ayda as they rode through the night, the moon lighting their path. The countryside was quiet, an occasional rustle signalled the presence of a rabbit or fox fleeing their steps. The sounds of hunters going about their business resounded through the air after each kill. Niall and Karl were leading the way, in deep discussion. Ayda heard snippets that confirmed her theory, Karl was unhappy.‘He doesn’t like us, does he?’ Ayda asked Theo. Theo had always been kind to her and Elle, even though he did all he could to avoid Syren. She couldn’t blame him, Syren was filled with hatred for humans. She had lost her entire family in one attack by them many years ago and had devoted her life to protecting her people from their malice. Syren was distantly behind them, watching the landscape for followers.‘He isn’t keen on this. He doesn’t understand what’s to gain. But, considering Syren’s loathing of him and your indifference, can you blame him?’ Theo soothed. Ayda guessed not. Ayda knew she had a long way to go before she accepted humans. She could not forgive them for her friend’s death and the death of so many people. She could talk to Theo, she found herself growing slowly to like him and appreciate him. Niall and Karl, however, she wasn’t sure she could. Niall was so infuriating, he pranced around like he was King, as if no one would dare threaten him. He was so confident and so boy-like she found him irksome. Karl, only spoke to offer dissuasion, she guessed he was the practical one of the three, the father figure somewhat, since he rarely joined in on their games and was always so alert and calculating.‘Why does Niall insist on joining us?’ Ayda asked.‘He has grown to care for your sister, she is truly special, even Karl has developed a soft spot I believe. But more than that, we have learned of magic, and this fight could spread to our race.” Theo offered kindly, riding beside her.‘He’s a thief. He only came for the horses, he cares not for history lessons.’ Ayda said scornfully. She wasn’t truly sure that was how she felt, but she was happy for Theo to believe it.‘He certainly doesn’t show his feelings well, but they are there. Surely you see his love for your sister and his interest in her path?’ Theo asked, Ayda ignored the question. Of course, she saw his love for Elle, he was here for her. To protect her and guide her. He had hugged her and played games with her just to make her smile. He had done nothing of the sort for Ayda. Just left her, as she liked it.‘Why do you and Karl follow him so loyally?’‘We are brothers. Niall would do anything for his friends and we have been through a lot together. I would gladly give my life for him.’ Theo said with such confidence. Ayda grunted, was he that great a person but she just could not see it?‘Look, you two have hardly spoken, maybe you should start by asking him how he knew where that tunnel was?’ Ayda glanced at him, what did he mean by that? She had been wondering how he knew, but recent events had distracted her. The way Theo was looking at her was unnerving, it was like he knew a secret about her, that she didn’t know. It bothered her.‘I am a bit shocked that you two are so, well, odd, towards each other,’ Theo continued, ‘after all you have been through.’ Ayda had guessed that they knew about her, they knew the story. How Niall had stolen her away but left him behind and then refused to help her get her friend back. Thankfully, Theo left it at that, seeing the look on Ayda’s face and moved away to join his friends at the front. Syren took the opportunity to catch up.‘What did he want?’ She demanded spitefully, gesturing at Theo.‘Just talking.’ Ayda mumbled.‘You never told me how you know him.’ Syren said. By him Ayda thought she must mean Niall, there was a special place in Syren’s heart for him, full of loathing and contempt.‘I don’t really know him. Just bumped into him when we were children.’ Ayda waved a hand. She did not want to add fuel to the fire by telling Syren that story. She was doing all she could to forget it. Syren’s face screwed up, she didn’t believe Ayda at all, but Ayda was grateful when she chose not to pursue the topic.‘What are we going to do about Princess Brielle?’ Syren asked, ‘If she can’t control her magic, we already have too many enemies.’‘I don’t know. I want to find someone to teach her,’ Ayda said, checking that Elle was still soundly sleeping. Elle had hardly spoken since her outburst, her magic had drained and weakened her, leaving her exhausted. Ayda didn’t know how long she’d been asleep.‘We have to flee from our pursuers and somehow get Elle some help. This is becoming impossible.’ Syren sighed.‘It’s why we need all the help we can get.’ Ayda said pointedly. Syren groaned.‘We don’t need them here Ayda!’‘As much as I hate to admit it, Niall’s right. She needs all her friends and family.’‘And you think they’re her friends? Humans are not friends to Elves!’‘This resentment you hold must stop! For her sake!’ Ayda commanded firmly.‘I lost my whole family Ayda! At least you still have your sister!’ Syren spat angrily.‘They did not kill your family,’ Ayda said calmly, ‘I’m truly sorry for your loss, I am, but we need to be stronger! These are the only friends we have!’Silence followed. Everyone had stopped to watch them. Ayda had not realised how loud their voices had become. They had probably been heard. Niall had a thoughtful look on his face, he could not seem to take his eyes off her. She felt herself growing nervous, had she said something wrong? He moved forward towards her and Syren.‘Ayda is right, this must stop. If you feel you cannot work as part of the team, then maybe you should go.’ He said to Syren his voice thick with ice.‘How dare you?!’ Syren hissed, Ayda had never seen her so angry.‘The same goes for all of us. We must be strong. We have our differences, but it is what share that we fight for.’ Ayda spoke clearly and confidently. Finally, she and Niall agreed on something. She hated how much stronger she felt when she knew he had her back.‘Spoken like a true Queen.’ Theo smiled at her.‘Ayda, you know I’m with you. But, I can’t be with them!’ Syren pleaded. Ayda could see this was the end of the road for her friend.‘You don’t have to like them. Just put the past where it belongs. In the past.’ Ayda whispered to her dear friend. It broke her heart to demand she make this choice, but the bickering and the mistrust could not go on. The team was facing such trials and such odds, there was no room for weakness that could lead to betrayal. Syren’s face was full of anger, Ayda knew she was longing to attack them. The anger was seeping from her friend like water through a gauze. They walked on, leaving Syren to make her choice. Miles down the road, Syren had not reappeared. She had made her choice. Ayda struggled to hold back her tears. Syren was her last friend, and she had pushed her away. Syren had chosen her hatred of humans over loyalty. Now, Ayda found herself alone, putting her trust in those she had been brought up to hate. Humans.",

      "content": "10 – NIALLShe was heartbroken. Her eyes were glassy and her lips trembling. Her face was paler than ever. He thought she was beautiful still. He shook the thought from his head. What was the point in harbouring such thoughts and feelings? She despised him, it felt like he was walking on egg shells around her, always having to be careful what to say or do. It annoyed him. She was so much like the girl he remembered, ferocious, loyal and caring. But she was so serious. He guessed that anybody would be serious if they had been through what they had. She had lost everything, after all. Niall never shared with anyone his concerns. They continued to plod further north, everyone knowing there was nothing for them north, but equally no one knowing what else to do. The aim was to keep moving and get the Legion off their trail, until someone had a better plan. He sighed, he was pretty sure this light bulb moment was further in the distance than they had time for. It had been days since they had left Syren behind. Ayda had hardly spoken to anyone except for Elle, who seemed equally distraught at Syren’s abandonment. It must be terrible for them, he thought, knowing that their own Protectors, their own people had all turned on them, and now finally, their very last elven friend had left them too. He felt partly responsible, if they had left, Syren would still be with her. But he could not leave them. Ayda had always been with him from the moment he took her in, his mind had always been with her, and now she was here, he felt he had purpose again. Then there was Elle, like a little sister to him, she was so special, so sweet and pure, he could not leave her. He felt as though the world could change with these two. Together they were so strong, so fearless, he felt a surge of pride as he thought that after all they had been through and were yet to go through they were standing together, as surely as ever. Alone in their mourning, alone in their fear. It reminded him very much of the companionship he had with his brothers. The five of them were so lucky that in the face of it all they had such strength in their relationship they were the toughest of allies. It was just a shame that Syren could not see it.The further north they progressed the colder it became. The luscious green pastures they had been travelling through had become hard and crisp, green grass had been replaced with white frost. There was no snow yet, but he felt sure that soon a thick, fluffy, sparkling blanket would settle around them. He could not deny it’s beauty, each morning, he would awaken, stiff and uncomfortable to see frozen droplets glittering from trees and a light mist floating in the distance. There was something magical about it. Theo’s leg had vastly improved and had managed to steal several warm winter cloaks that were left hanging outside people’s homes. They had passed several empty villages, all void of life, and managed to scrape together some essentials. Wrapped up as warm as they could with some supplies, they had continued. Ayda had been concerned about the villages, according to her, the only abandoned villages they would find would be at the Wastes. She was upset to find so many lifeless dwellings. It had made the group nervous. Had the people fled the winter, or were they forcibly removed? Was something circling them like a hawk circles its prey? They had no way of knowing.‘Fire!’ Elle squeaked from the middle of the group. This time she was riding with Theo on his white stallion. Niall had suggested she sit with each of them in turn, to save any one horse from excess weight every day. Elle had agreed but had expressed her desire for her own horse to care for. So, Niall had promised that the first horse they could get for her, she would have. Niall looked where the young Princess was pointing, there was indeed smoke rising in the distance.‘Could it be a village?’ Niall asked Ayda, who seemed to know this area quite well. She nodded, concern in her eyes.‘It could be a trap.’ Karl said sternly.‘I agree, we should avoid it.’ Niall nodded.‘If it’s my people, I will help them,’ Ayda announced firmly.‘And me!’ Piped up Elle.‘Well, you’ll never know, because we’re going arou- where do you think you’re going!?’ Niall called, Ayda had galloped off in the direction of the fire.‘God damn it! She wants us to protect her, but the only thing she needs protecting from is her stupidity,’ He cursed, they chased after her. It was a town, another white stone town. Elves were screaming and running in a frenzy from burning homes, the stone that held their town together was cracking and smashing as it was assaulted by blast upon blast by thrown explosives. Thankfully Ayda stopped as the group re-joined her just out of sight.‘What’s going on?’ Niall hissed.‘It’s the Legion, they’re attacking the town.’ Ayda whispered, her voice crushed as she watched her people brutally battered by the soldiers. Each soldier was clad head to toe in red, with black armour covering every inch of his body.‘We need to leave!’ Karl growled, taking in the scene before him.‘There aren’t many of them – we can take them!’ Ayda said defiantly.‘You just said it’s the Legion, you know, the ones that want to kill you!’ Niall said, outraged. Here he was risking his neck to keep her and her sister alive and now she just wanted to hand herself over to the people who want her dead.‘They’re our people Niall!’‘We’re NOT going in there!’‘If it was your people what would you do?’ Ayda demanded.‘I thought you said the Legion had magic?’‘Only the Captain, these are just soldiers!’‘Oh, should be a piece of piss then, just a normal fight with trained swords and no magic!’ Niall replied sarcastically.‘I’m going to save my people, do what you want!’ Ayda spat, bored of the argument. Pelting away from the group she ran full throttle into the town. Swearing loudly and shouting quick instructions to Theo to keep Elle away, he and Karl bolted after her. Niall watched, impressed, just as Ayda flew from her horse, and smashed a shocked soldier into the flames, rock fell, and he was crushed instantly. A second soldier died moments later, as Ayda pounced upon him and thrust her blade through the eye of his mask. Riding into the chaos, Niall smashed the hilt of his sword into the face of a passing soldier as Karl ran one through. As soon as they were close enough, they jumped from their horses and ran to Ayda’s side just as she had finished another soldier with a vicious slice to his throat. She kept crying out to the towns people, begging them to run. But with the sight of her something in the balance had changed. Several men picked up blades from the fallen and rushed to fight by her side. Soon, a small battalion had formed around her of Elves standing their ground slashing their way together through the soldiers. Many towns people fell, bleeding, they were not much use against the armour and training of the Legion’s Soldiers. Ayda felt her heart swell with pride, fighting beside her people. They had not all abandoned her. Ayda heard Niall laugh with relief as he finished the final soldier. The Elves before her cheered and celebrated their victory, then many turned to the wounded and dying, and the utter pain of defeat hit them. Niall stepped closer to Ayda has she was approached.‘Princess, it’s good to see you – but you should not have come.’ An older Elf with wispy hair, knelt to her and took her hand.‘It is good to see you too Sir -?’‘I am Aran, your Highness.’ He kissed her hand.‘Are you the leader here?’ She asked.‘No, your Highness, our Lord fled long ago, he heard of the raids on villages, knew they were heading here.’ Aran said.‘He just left you all here?’ Ayda responded, aghast.‘Of course, he fears the Legion. I must say, we would all be dead now if it wasn’t for you and your – ah – comrades. Humans?!’ Aran’s pleasure turned to panic as he saw Niall and Karl.‘Aran,’ Ayda stepped before them, ‘These are friends, they have done much to protect me.’Aran eyed them both suspiciously. Niall felt the Elves around them watching him closely. He puffed up with pleasure as he saw Ayda step into defend them and refer to them as friends. Maybe she was starting to trust him after all? Aran could not seem to take his eyes of him. He was a short, stocky Elf, who’s dirty farmer’s clothes did not suit the heavy metal sword in his hand.‘Aran, is there any news? Why are they raiding villages here?’ Ayda asked quickly. Niall knew she was keen to move on, news would spread, and retribution would be swift, she did not want to get caught here.‘They know you are in the area my Princess, they are ruthless in their hunt for you and Princess Brielle,’ Aran asked, his eyes snapping back to her.‘Yet you remain loyal to my family? Why?’ Ayda asked politely.‘The King ruled in peace and brought prosperity to Myrliar, The Legion undo all of his honourable work. We will remember him. He would not have stood for all this bloodshed. The Elders deserve no loyalty after what they have done.’Ayda replied, ‘I thank you, but you must all leave, they will return.’‘You are most kind, your Highness, but I fear we will all die, wherever we go.’ Niall followed Ayda, as they searched the town for their horses. Bodies littered the ground, soldier and town people alike, the white paved streets were bleeding. Niall felt his heart ache as he watched the distress shadowing Ayda’s face as she heard her people crying in pain. She was kind, he saw. Every so often she would help put out fires and hold the hands of dying elves, offering what condolences she could. Finally, they found each of their horses on route. Leading them back to the main group of Elves to bid their farewell and wish them luck.‘Farewell, Princess, best of luck. We are all with you.’ Aran said enthusiastically, kneeling once more. Just as the three of them turned to leave, a cold cruel voice sounded from the other side of the town square. Looking up Niall’s blood turned to ice as he saw what he had feared the most. A blood red cloak was sweeping across the stone paves, soaking blood up as it went. A silver half mask covered the face of the wearer, his crooked black teeth smiling evilly at them.‘Princess Ayda, it’s wonderful to see you here.’ His voice was sickeningly smooth, like wine laced with poison. This man emanated power. He stood alone, but confident, the world around him seemed to bend to his will as he moved ever closer to them.‘Run, Princess, run! We’ll distract him.’ Aran whispered to them. Niall admired the man’s courage. Surely, he knew he would stand no chance against a Captain of the Legion. Niall didn’t know what to do, he had only heard about the Captains from Elle, but he knew he had magic. He could almost sense it glowing from him. He knew their swords were going to be no more than feathers to this man.‘You know, there is nowhere for you to run your Highness. Where is your sister?’ The man gloated.‘I’d die before I told you!’ Ayda spat. Niall resisted the urge to grab her, she sounded so strong, but he could see her trembling as their death approached.‘Oh, you will die, but I have soldiers searching around this town right now, so you can watch me kill her first.’ The Captain could hardly contain his glee. His black crooked teeth had been showing since his arrival, he could not stop grinning like a cat that has cornered a mouse.‘She’s nowhere near here you fool!’ Ayda laughed convincingly.‘You mean to tell me you abandoned her? Never. You’ll be keeping her close by.’ He seethed.Niall thought quickly, they would find her for sure. She wasn’t too far away, and Theo was not going to be able to protect her against so many foes alone. They had to buy them some time. Thankfully, Ayda seemed to have come to the same conclusion. Moving away from Niall and Karl she was pacing closer to the Captain, his gaze following her unblinkingly. From the corner of his eye, Niall could see a small boy crouched, hiding a few yards from him. Slowly, he moved over, careful not to draw attention. The Captain’s eyes were stuck on Ayda like a wolf hunting its prey. He reached the boy, and out of the corner of his mouth he spoke.‘I need you to do something urgently for me.’ Niall whispered. The boy’s big eyes were wide with fear.‘I need you to take a message to Princess Brielle for me.’ He continued. He hoped the boy was loyal to the Princesses, this was a huge risk, but he had to get them away from here. The boy, although afraid, nodded.‘Tell her a Captain is here, he is searching for her, she must flee. My friend Theo will be with her. Go with them, they will keep you safe.’ He whispered instructions on how to find the Princess, and the boy snuck quickly and quietly from the town, in the wrong direction. Niall had instructed him not to go straight there, to make sure he wasn’t easily followed. Niall hadn’t noticed that a few of the town folk had moved, led by Aran, slowly and carefully through the burnt-out buildings closer and closer to the Captain. Niall watched them with fascination. They had planned this and moved without so much as a flicker of acknowledgement from the Captain. Was he that focussed on Ayda? Suddenly, the men ran from their hiding spots as one, their swords raised, screaming “For the King!” He had noticed them. He didn’t hesitate as he swung his arms in the air, the men rose helplessly like puppets before he flung them against a nearby building. With a nasty crunch, the men slid down the wall and landed in a pile on the ground, unmoving, not even a breath. Niall spied Aran’s face at the bottom of the pile, his face was as fixed with determination in death as it had been in life. Shock shook Niall, what chance did any of them have against a monster that powerful?‘Niall, move, quickly!’ Karl snapped, jabbing him in the ribs. Niall noticed with a pang that Ayda was gone. He let Karl lead him away as he scanned the area for her, he couldn’t see her anywhere.‘Does the Captain have her?’ He asked urgently. Karl shook his head, everyone had used the scuffle to flee the town hall and hide. A loud crack resonated through the air, peering around a corner, he glimpsed the Captain blasting everything out of the way in his fury to find her.‘We have to find her!’ Niall whispered, ducking as another crash sounded. They ran, amidst the chaos as buildings around them exploded, trapping fleeing civilians, the shrieking and smashing was thunderous. A woman yards from them flew off her feet as she caught the sight of the Captain, who laughed wickedly as she fell into flame. The Captain was calling for her. Niall tried to keep him in eye sight as much as he could whilst searching for the Princess.‘Oh no,’ He said, aghast. The Captain had grown bored of smashing things and had instead woven magic into the form of five great silver wolves. The same wolves that had hunted them nights before.‘Climb, climb!’ Niall roared to everyone around him. He and Karl climbed rubble onto the nearest roof, helping as many as they could. The wolves were ravaging anyone they could find. Karl leapt onto another roof top, Niall followed. Scouting around looking for Ayda, finally they saw her. Thankfully she had also managed to escape the jaws of the giant wolves rampaging their way through the town. Blood curdling screams filled the air as the wolves continued to find their victims. Niall dared not call out to her. He couldn’t bear to see these enemies press down on her. He nudged Karl and nodded in her direction. Slowly and carefully, staying on the roof tops, they climbed over to her. Then it happened, in a split second, Ayda was thrown into the air like a doll. The Captain had found her. Niall watched in terror as her body zoomed through the air and was caught roughly by the throat. She kicked and squirmed as his nails dug into her neck.‘No!’ Niall roared. The wolves around them disappeared into white smoke, they were no longer needed, the Captain had what he wanted. Niall threw himself off the rooftop and sprinted to her faster than he had ever ran in his life. He could not defeat this man, he knew that, but he had to do something. Niall shouted for her as he reached them. Turning his head, the Captain grinned wickedly at Niall and snapped his fingers together. Immediately Niall’s body froze, his legs and arms were pinned, he fell forwards with the momentum of his run and landed face first on the cold hard slabs. The Captain turned and walked away from him, his hand still around Ayda’s throat, carrying her as if she were lighter than air. Niall felt himself being turned over and dragged unceremoniously away. Karl roughly sat him against a wall.‘There’s nothing we can do brother!’ Karl growled as he slapped him. Niall still could not move but he could see. He watched helplessly, his eyes stinging as Ayda was carried away. He had almost given up hope when… BANG. The Captain stumbled back. BANG. Pushed back again, the Captain lost his hold on Ayda, she stumbled, and crawled desperately away from him. An invisible force was battering the Captain. His shield reverberated through the air, ripples showing in the invisible barrier around him. Shock was etched onto the Captain’s face as he spun around trying to find the source of this power. A grin grew across his face. Niall’s heart sank. Elle had come for her sister. She was walking like a girl much older than her years. A confidence born of anger and hatred, her face was twisted with a dark fury. Niall nursed a deep fear of her, her eyes were black as coal and unseeing. She did not appear to notice the destruction around her as her eyes fixed on the Captain in a deadly glare. Ayda was weeping, in pain or shock no-one knew, Niall wanted to call out to her, but he still couldn’t move. Karl was stuck to his side threateningly, ready to defend his friend against anything. He watched as Elle continued to move forward pelting the Captain with strike after strike, he was no longer stumbling, he expected her. His shield held firm as her attack continued, then finally she paused, measuring her target. He made the most of her hesitation and pushed his magic into the buildings next to her, they exploded all around her. Niall heard screaming ringing in his mind. Dust choked everyone, he couldn’t see her. Ayda had not moved from her spot, she looked ready to jump in to save her sister, but what could she do? The dust settled, and Elle emerged, she had conjured a shield and saved herself from the blast, to the amusement of the Captain and the surprised relief of everyone else.‘You are learning little one.’ He cajoled. Instantly sparks shot from his outstretched hands and electrified her shield, millions of ripples resounded through the air. Elle’s small face was scrunched up as she concentrated on her shield. Niall watched as white-hot flames burst out of her hand and surrounded the Captain in a blaze. Both mages continued to batter each-other fiercely, with none making a huge impact, blow after blow was blocked, their shields stood strong.‘Someone’s got to tire first. Let’s hope it’s not Elle.’ Karl grumbled. It couldn’t be Elle, Niall reassured himself. The Captain spent so much of his power on those fearsome wolves and blowing up this town, surely after Elle managed to bring down a Castle and kill every soldier there she must be stronger! His resolve began to falter as the battle ensued. Elle stopped attacking, her little angry face was screwed up and tight as she concentrated fully on her shield. A huge blast of power from the Captain quaked her shield and she stumbled backwards a few steps. She was losing. Her magic was failing. Ayda had spotted it too, as quickly as she could, she ran towards the Captain with her sword raised, roaring in desperation. The Captain didn’t even look at her as he waved his hand and sent her flying. She fell, motionless like a doll, to the floor beside them. Niall was furious, he still could not move, he couldn’t even call out to her and Karl was point blank refusing to leave him. Someone had to help her! Elle grew weaker and weaker by the second, slowly, his heart sank as her shield flickered and she slowly backed down to her knees, tears streaming from her eyes. It all happened at once. The Captain screamed out in pain as a dagger slid its way through his throat just before everything was thrown backwards in a sudden blast of power. Ringing sounded in his ears, dust filled the air. Then silence. Complete eerie silence. Was Elle alive? What had happened to the Captain? Instantly, the feeling in his arms and legs returned, he could move again. Clumsily he got to his feet, aided by Karl, who was covered in soot and dust. He ran over to Ayda and checked her, she was breathing but unconscious. Karl, being larger and stronger picked her up.‘Elle!’ Niall roared. He couldn’t see two feet in front of him. Hands outstretched he began to wade through the dust in the direction he last saw her. Finally, the dust began to settle. Everything was covered in a thin layer of white sand, bodies and bricks alike. The moment Niall saw her he ran to her, occasionally tripping over his new legs.‘Elle you’re OK. Thank the lord you’re OK!’ He sighed deeply with relief, hardly believing it. He made to hug her. She resisted him, gazing into the distance. “Ayda’s OK, we’ve got her, we need to go.”‘She saved me.’ Elle whispered in shock. Confused, Niall followed her gaze to a young woman unmoving on the ground not far from the dead Captain. The woman’s red hair was speckled with dust and debris. Syren.‘Oh no, no, no!’ Niall exclaimed rushing over to Syren’s limp form. Her eyes were open, her breathing was slow. Pain was written all over her pale and dusty face.‘Why did you do that?’ Elle whispered, she had followed Niall to Syren’s side. Syren reached out feebly for the young Princess’s hand.‘You and Ayda are my only family.’ Syren said weakly, breath catching in her throat. With that, Elle kissed her friend on the cheek and whispered something Niall could not hear. He examined the Elf’s body, there were a few scratches and slight bruises visible, but he feared the force of the blast from Elle had caused worse internal damage. There was no way for him to tell what was draining her of life, and he could not see how long she had left. They needed help. They needed a miracle. Wounds he could help to heal, but so little was known of internal injury. He could not help but fear the worst for the young ferocious Elf who had saved their lives. He looked at Ayda, lying in Karl’s arms, and felt his heart hit the floor. How could anyone explain to her that after all she had lost, she was to now lose her dearest friend?‘What do we do?’ Karl asked quietly.‘I don’t know if she can be moved, but we can’t stay here.’ Niall responded, stroking Elle’s hair as she watched over Syren’s frail frame.‘Karl,’ Niall said, standing to look at this friend. ‘Take the Princesses and find Theo, I’m going to stay with Syren.’‘She won’t last, come with us. There’s no point you getting yourself into danger.’ Karl replied firmly.‘I’m not leaving her here alone,’ Niall snapped, ‘She deserves more than that.’ Karl stood resolute. He was not leaving Niall alone. Niall looked at Syren, he had never appreciated her, she had been frustrating and dismissive to him and his friends, but she had been steadfast in their goal. She had risked her life protecting her family, and he could not forget that. Surely, now, they could at last, put race behind them and move on? Syren’s eyes were locked on his. Her eyes once bright, alert and alarming, were now tired and red, betraying the broken body they concealed.‘Leave me,’ She whispered. ‘Keep them safe.’ Niall considered Elle. She was sat, staring at him, her face pale and sickly. Surprisingly, there were no tears. He doubted the poor girl had many tears left to shed after all she had seen and learned. He could not leave Syren, Elle and Ayda would hate him forever. He knew however, that staying here with Syren kept Ayda and Elle at risk, the Legion would come, and they would stand no chance fighting them off now. His heart felt bruised and battered that whichever path he chose, Ayda would forever hate him. He had to make the right decision for everyone.‘I can’t.’ Niall replied, ‘You’re coming with us.’Syren gave a feeble laugh and shook her head, ‘I cannot move, I am too weak.’‘We will carry you.’‘I am dying.’ Syren said matter-of-factly. Niall marvelled at her courage, to throw yourself in harm’s way for those you love and be aware of the price you will pay was admirable. He could not fail to respect her for that.‘Ayda will want to say goodbye, but here, we are all at risk.’ Niall said sadly, kneeling by her side once more. Syren nodded, understanding. He felt uncomfortable at delivering the final message but knew it would do the trick. Syren would do anything for Ayda, that much she had proven.‘Karl, find Theo, we’ll need all the help we can find.’ Niall requested. Karl finally nodded, and carrying Ayda, retreated out of the destroyed village. Elle would not leave Syren’s side, she had not let go of her friend’s hand. Niall decided to leave them alone, he wandered into the nearest wreckage to seek scraps of crates or carts for a make shift litter. He pondered his decision, it would undoubtedly be uncomfortable for Syren, but he could not leave her here alone and he could not risk the Princesses’ safety. Sighing, he collected anything useful he could find, steeling his heart against the broken bodies of villagers lying in the aftermath. Many minutes passed, and he had collected several decent sized planks of wood and lengths of rope.‘Niall!’ He heard Elle shout for him. Then he heard it, distantly he could hear the thunder of hooves pounding the ground. Someone was approaching the village. Niall dashed faster than lightning back to the square. Syren and Elle had somehow managed to shimmy Syren up against a wall, where she was now resting, Elle beside her. Niall stood before them, dropping his collection to the ground nearby, his fist firmly clenching the hilt of his sword, ready to meet the traveller. The horse was a huge, monstrously built black stallion, Niall would guess eighteen hands high, and was armoured in gold matching it’s rider. The rider was head to toe in gold, Niall felt a shiver of remembrance as he took in the stance, and the emblem adorning the golden armour. The Royal Emblem. Niall remembered seeing such armour many years ago when he bid farewell to a young and sad Princess. Niall heard Elle gasp and run to stand beside him.‘It’s Sir Rakel! My Father’s Protector!’ She whispered excitedly. Niall had to stop himself from pointing out that Sir Rakel had not done a particularly good job of protecting the King, seeing as he had been nowhere around at the time of the King’s brutal murder. The horse was approaching ever nearer.‘Stop!’ Niall called out confidently with his sword raised, pushing Elle back with the other hand.‘What are you doing?’ Elle squealed.‘I do not know I can trust him!’ Niall murmured to her, pushing her gently backwards, not lowering his sword arm.‘Peace, boy!’ The rider called out to him, slowing and stopping at a respectful distance.‘What business do you have here?’ Niall responded clearly.‘I have been tracking your party for days, I am here for their Royal Highnesses,’ Sir Rakel called.‘They are no longer here, they have left this village as you see it.’ Niall bluffed feebly.‘Do not try to insult me, for I see young Princess Brielle behind you.’ Sir Rakel laughed, as he dismounted his stallion proudly. He walked confidently closer to them, his gauntleted hands raised in front of him in surrender.‘I would recognise that young Elf anywhere.’ He said proudly, removing his helm and smiling kindly at her as he approached.‘Sir Rakel would never hurt me.’ Elle pleaded with Niall. She was the happiest he had ever seen her, he face was glowing with excitement as she watched Sir Rakel approach. Niall was at a loss, this man he knew to be the same Elf that had rescued Ayda, and he was here, a typical Knight in Shining Armour to protect Elle. But something was amiss, how had this Elf tracked them for so long to now conveniently find them when they were so much weakened. He kept his sword high.‘You are right not to trust me human,’ Sir Rakel said, ‘I know what happened at the Stone Castle, the betrayal my dear King suffered. I am not your enemy.’‘I would not trust anyone with the Princess.’ Niall spat, the niceties had vanished. Sir Rakel growled as he drew his own sword and raised it in challenge. Niall could see the Elf was much older than he, his hair was white, and skin was slightly creased. Niall had always admired the way Elves were spared the fate of time and aged much slower than humans. Despite the difference in age, Niall disliked the odds, this Elf was wiser and heavily armoured. He would not likely win this alone.‘I have known the Princess since she was a babe, and her Father was always my brother, I would ask how I can trust a human with one so precious to me!’‘Stop it!’ Elle screeched, ignoring Niall’s protests she moved between them her hands outstretched. Immediately, Sir Rakel bowed down to one knee, in a gesture of obedience Niall had never seen before. Sensing the danger had passed with Brielle’s intervention, Niall lowered his sword slightly as Elle approached him.‘I know you are trying to protect me. You must learn to trust me, as I do you. You cannot harm this Elf without harming me.’ Brielle said kindly and confidently, her eyes were blazing with emotion. This old soldier meant a lot to her, he could see. He sheathed his sword, glaring at the Golden Protector. Sir Rakel was still bowed on one knee, his sword on the ground beside him, inches from his fingertips. Niall watched carefully, his heart quickening as Elle smiled at him as she turned to approach Sir Rakel. He struggled against his own instincts, mere seconds it would take for the old Elf to grab his sword and wipe Elle from this world, he prayed he was wrong. He was too far away now to help her. Trust me, she had asked. In a world where everyone she knew was gone or betrayed, she still believed in trust. She still loved this Elf even in his failure to protect her Father. He held his breath as she bid the Protector to rise and felt relief flood his heart as he watched them embrace, as a father would embrace his child after years apart. Satisfied, he relaxed as he watched Sir Rakel lift the Princess off her feet and sweep her around in circles, both laughing with relief and happiness. Niall felt a slight sting as he remembered his own Father, he would do anything to speak with him again.‘Sir- Sir Rakel?’ A weak voice sounded, puncturing the elation of the moment.‘Syren?’ Sir Rakel’s face brightened with enthusiasm, then flickered when he recognised the weakness and pain. She was trying desperately to stand, but to no avail, her legs were barely strong enough to move.‘Oh, my dear, what has happened to you?’ Sir Rakel moved to Syren’s side, Elle following miserably behind.‘It was all my fault.’ Elle mumbled miserably, crouching down to Syren.‘What happened?’ Sir Rakel asked again.‘The Captain attacked the village looking for me, I fought him off, he had Ayda.’ Elle explained.‘With your magic?’ The Protector asked quickly, Elle nodded, shocked.‘How do you know about her magic?’ Niall demanded suspiciously. Sir Rakel sighed.‘Of course, I knew, your Father knew you had magic.’ Sir Rakel said.‘Why-why didn’t he tell me?’ Elle asked.‘You were too young, and we never really knew how powerful you would become. It was better kept a secret. As you are now aware, The Elders do not take kindly to Mages.’‘If you knew they would do this, why did you not protect her? Protect Ayda? Protect the King and Queen?’ Niall burst out furiously.‘We didn’t think it would happen so soon. I am sorry for your Father, Princess, he made me promise to hide the Queen, to get his Queen to safety.’ Sir Rakel’s voice wavered.‘My Mother is safe?’ Elle exclaimed.‘Yes,’ Sir Rakel responded. ‘I thought you would know, she sent me to you.’‘Where is she? We must go to her!’‘We cannot go, I must get you to the Temple.’‘Why?’‘Because when I was young, my best friend was sent there in secret, smuggled from the city,’ Sir Rakel began, ‘He met with a Scholar at the Temple who taught him to control his gift. If we can find this Scholar, he can help you with yours.’‘You mean my Father,’ Elle said, ‘This Scholar taught my Father to use his magic,’ Sir Rakel nodded. Syren tried to smother a whine as pain engulfed her. Sir Rakel ended the conversation, explaining that they needed to move on as quickly as possible. Together they bound Niall’s gatherings into a make-shift litter and cleverly attached wheels from an abandoned cart. Carefully lifting Syren into it, Niall admired their handiwork. The litter looked like a tiny box on wheels, complete with walls and roof, in her weakened state, they decided to make it as protected as possible. It wasn’t perfect, and her feet were dangling slightly out of it, but it would have to do. With encouragement and assistance, Elle was lifted by her Knight onto the saddle of his huge stallion, named Trojan, and she followed on as they carried Syren away from the ruins of the village. Elle looked tiny seated upon the beast, her head bobbing with each mountainous step. They moved slowly and silently, straining from the effort of pulling the litter, careful not to disturb Syren’s broken body too much.‘Ayda!’ Elle called with glee. Finally, they were together. Ayda was flying on her horse faster than anything Niall had ever seen. He hardly caught a glimpse of her as she leapt from her horse and careered towards her sister smothering her with affection. She had eyes only for her sister. Theo and Karl approached soon after. Theo was sporting a bruised face, Niall noticed as he greeted his friend.‘What happened to you?’ He asked.‘The little Princess happened. She knocked me out when I tried to restrain her.’ Theo explained quietly.‘You got beaten by a child?’ Niall laughed, ‘Pathetic.’‘She has magic!’ Theo exclaimed, abashed. Elle tore herself away from her sister and jumped into Theo, apologising for her attack on him. Niall watched as Sir Rakel once again got down on one knee as Ayda recognised him. Silence followed as a resounding SMACK echoed through the air. Ayda had smacked Sir Rakel around the face. Niall leapt in to save him.‘Where were you!’ She shrieked, her eyes flashing fire. She rounded on him again, Niall grabbed her.‘I’m sorry Princess, I had to follow my orders!’ Sir Rakel pleaded, tears brimming his eyes, he had the good sense to stay kneeled.‘Is that why you are here? To kill us like you killed him!’ She howled. The effort of restraining her was akin to keeping a predator from its prey.‘No! I never killed him! I loved your Father!’‘You left him to die! You were supposed to protect him!’‘Ayda stop! Listen to him!’ Elle said loudly and firmly. All eyes were drawn to the small Elf.‘We should kill him Elle, he cannot be trusted!’ Ayda hissed.‘Yes, you should kill me, for I have wanted nothing more since leaving my King. But let me explain!’ Sir Rakel said, defeated. Ayda was still ricocheting in Niall’s arms, it was becoming increasingly difficult to hold her. Finally, she broke free, smashing Niall in the face she floored him, and ran full pelt at Sir Rakel.‘No more,’ Elle said simply. Elle raised her hand and stopped her sister dead. Ayda could not move. Her eyes darted from Sir Rakel to Elle in horror. She was frozen mid-run like a statue.‘I’m sorry Ayda,’ Elle whispered, ‘There has been enough hate, listen to what he has to say. Please.’ Sir Rakel repeated his explanation to the newcomers. He explained the King’s knowledge of power and how he was taught in secret by a Scholar at the Temple. He explained the King’s suspicions of Brielle, their long conversations about her power. The promise he made to his beloved friend, to protect his wife, his Queen above all else. Sir Rakel confessed his battle, he wanted to protect the Princesses but was torn between his conscience and his command. Sir Rakel expressed his remorse that one part of the King’s plan had failed. The King had planned on getting the Princesses and training Brielle himself, but had underestimated the Legion. In the end he and Sir Morcei had managed to sneak the Queen out of the City with a band of loyal Protectors. She was now safely in hiding in the Pearl Mountains with her Guard, presumed buried beneath the rubble of the Castle.‘Mother would not have left without us.’ Elle said simply, releasing Ayda from her state. Ayda stood, watching Sir Rakel with a calculating look.‘No. We had to slip something in her drink that night, so she had no choice.’ Sir Rakel chuckled sadly and pointed at the ghost of a bruise that had only recently healed around his eye, ‘She gave me this when she realised what I had done.’‘As soon as she heard the Legion were still searching for you, and that you escaped the City, she sent me to find you.’ Sir Rakel finished.‘Are we going to her?’ Ayda asked, hope getting the better of her.‘No, I am to take you both North, to the Temple of Scholars, so Elle can begin her education.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘No, she isn’t.’ Ayda commanded firmly. Sir Rakel looked abashed and confused.‘Have you not heard –’ He began.‘Yes, I have heard. The Scholars work with the Elders. I would not trust the Scholars with Brielle, and I do not trust you.’ Ayda said firmly.‘Yes, the Scholars work closely with the Elders, but there is one that does not. The same one who trained your Father.’‘According to you! How do I know this is not all lies!?’ Ayda demanded. Niall could understand her mistrust. She had been shocked and deeply hurt by the betrayal of the Patrol, and by the Guards of the Castle who had turned on her family. He guessed she did not want to put her faith in this Protector, for fear that this time, the betrayal would kill her.‘I have only my word.’ Sir Rakel finished, his hand upon his heart and his head bowed. For the first time, Ayda glimpsed the litter behind them, rested on the ground. Anger flickered from her face replaced by weary curiosity.‘What is that?’ She spat, pointing.‘It’s Syren.’",

      "content": "11 – AYDAAyda’s heart hit the floor when she heard the name. Her temper and hatred for Sir Rakel dissipated as quickly as it had built. It couldn’t be. Syren had left them, chosen to abandon them. How had she been injured? Ayda looked to Elle, a vision of regret, and knew it to be true. Syren had come back?“She’d been following us Ayda,” Elle whispered. Ayda took a deep breath and slowly prepared herself for the worst as she edged to the rear of the litter. Her friend was awake, but still. Her red hair was rolling across her shoulders as her chest gently shook as she struggled to breath. A weak smile flitted across Syren’s face. Her dear friend and her equal had come back, and somehow, she had been bettered. But bettered by who?‘It was my fault.’ Elle said timidly behind her. Ayda could not feel anger. She felt a deep sorrow bubbling in her stomach. Syren had been one of the toughest fighters she had known, what had reduced her to this?‘You lost control?’ Ayda asked.‘No, but she did get hurt by the blast.’‘You killed the Captain alone?’‘Not alone, Syren helped…’ Elle mumbled.‘You should have stayed with Theo.’ Ayda said calmly, her eyes not leaving her weakened friend, who had since dozed off.‘I wasn’t leaving you.’ Elle said firmly. Ayda guessed that the others had left them alone. Given them time with Syren. Time to grieve. Ayda felt poison fill her mouth, time to grieve. All her life had been spent on grieving. She had no more energy for it. No more tears to shed and no more strength for the crushing weight. Her head was swimming with worry. She could not allow herself to hope that her Mother, the Queen, had survived. Ayda had learnt the hard way that there was little to hope for in this life. Life was full of loss, first her beloved childhood friend, then her Parents and now Syren. Elle had wrapped her small arms around the Soldier’s waist. Ayda peered down at her, tears were streaming from the little Elf’s eyes in sorrow.‘You saved us all Elle,’ Ayda soothed, ‘Shed no tears.’‘Will she live?’ Elle asked.‘We are going to save her. Together.’ Ayda said firmly. She wanted so desperately to believe it. She would encourage Brielle to believe, yet her heart would not sing the same song. Her heart had long tired of hope and pain.‘We should go to the Temple, like Sir Rakel says.’‘Why? Would you not rather see Mother?’ Ayda replied, surprised.‘Of course! But… I would only hurt her. I need to learn my magic.’ Brielle nodded sadly.Ayda knew she was right. The idea that the Scholars could help her had appeared in her mind over the last few days. Magic was rare. But it seemed to flow through the Temple from the stories and the history that the Scholars possessed. If anyone would know about magic it would be them. If there really was a Scholar prepared to help them, who had helped her Father, then it could be a turning point for them. They were treading water, not wanting to take the plunge. Their enemies were surrounding them and were more powerful, Elle was the only one who could stand against them. They had no other option.‘The Scholars have the best healing skills too, they will help Syren.’ Ayda agreed, deciding on their course.‘Will the others come?’‘Syren and Rakel definitely. But I don’t know about the others.’ Ayda replied. She spied Niall, Theo and Karl approaching, leading their horses who had bolted during the fight. Each of them looked weighed down, with a dark cloud circling their heads. It had been a turbulent time for all of them. The humans knew nothing of their history, and nothing of Magic. These men had volunteered to protect her sister but were now out of their depth. As she now felt.‘They helped us, you know.’ Elle said quietly, following Ayda’s line of sight.‘How?’ Ayda replied, her eyes not moving from Niall. He still reminded her of the boy who had saved her. He was brave, playful and kind. His innocence had gone, as had hers. They were both hardened now, anchored by responsibility.‘Karl carried you to safety. Niall refused to leave her.’‘Leave who?’‘Syren.’Ayda’s eyebrows rose. Guilt flowed through her veins. She had treated him so poorly. Ayda and Syren had not trusted them from the moment they met in that barn. Niall had proved himself over and over to them, but they still refused to let him in. Niall had saved her life over and over, but Ayda still loathed him. Syren despised humans in general, it was nothing personal. But Ayda knew it was more than that for her. She was connected to Niall by a string of memories she would rather scourge from her mind. His playful kind face, reminded her of Jonas’. The realisation that Niall had protected and carried Syren to safety, pulled the veil from her mind. She had been so very wrong.‘Where we headed then, boss?’ Niall winked at her as he approached.‘You’re coming?’ Elle squealed, running up to Theo.‘I promised we’d protect you, and even though we’re not much use right now, the jobs not done.’ Niall laughed. Ayda fought back the urge to hold him. Even now, against all the odds and all the struggles, he was steadfast. Something must have shown in Ayda’s eye because Niall’s face softened as he walked closer to her.‘How is she? The Old Knight seems to think there are healers at the Temple?’ He said softly, peering in to check Syren.‘Yes, that is where we must go.’ Ayda replied. Niall nodded in understanding.‘Thank you for saving her, and for... well everything.’ Ayda added, blushing slightly.‘You’re going soft,’ Niall replied, Ayda could see he was secretly pleased, it had taken her too long.‘Do you think Sir Rakel remembers you?’‘What? From when? Eh?’ Niall seemed shocked as he stumbled over his words.‘From across the bridge, you know when we were children.’ Ayda replied, wondering why he reacted so worriedly. Ayda grew suspicious, it wasn’t like him, was he hiding something? Had something happened between them? Had Sir Rakel gone back to the town for revenge?‘Oh, I dunno,’ Niall said, seemingly relieved, ‘You don’t trust him.’‘You think I should?’‘Since when have you cared what I thought?’ Niall laughed shyly. Ayda became very aware that they were alone with sleeping Syren. Elle had been whisked away by Karl and Theo.‘I hate him for leaving Father.’‘Yet, if he’s telling the truth, then he saved your Mother,’ Niall shrugged.‘He could have taken Elle with him.’‘Your Father was a Mage, they probably believed he was more likely to succeed in protecting your Sister,’ Niall countered. When Ayda opened her mouth to argue Niall raised his hand.‘You are wise not to readily trust but be careful not to push the few friends you have away.’‘Are we going?’ Sir Rakel appeared with the others, each had mounted a horse waiting for them. Ayda and Niall climbed onto their mounts and followed Sir Rakel north. Ayda hoped she had made the right decision, her mind seemed so clouded, and everything was out of her control. She thought on what Niall had said and knew he was right. She found herself trusting him, and his comrades, they were still with her after all, when so many of her Elven friends were now her enemies. Syren’s cart prattled behind them, lead on by Karl and Theo. She hoped it would not take long to get to the Temple, she prayed Syren would make it.Days passed without event. The snow had melted as they moved on. Fertile green lands adorned with everlasting trees and endless rolling hills made way for the smooth glass river, flowing fluently through the lips of land. They had reached the Myr River within a day and were now following it steadily north as instructed. Syren had not weakened as much as they feared, even though she spent much of her time sleeping. The sound of rushing water had soothed Ayda, the peaceful tranquillity of water had poured through her and seemingly washed many of her concerns away. Unfortunately, the river had not washed Sir Rakel away, she thought. She wanted to trust him, she really did. He had been a close companion of her Father since they were boys and like an Uncle to her and Elle. But how could she trust him after he abandoned them? To Elle, it was like he had never been missing. She still loved him and respected him. Ayda knew Elle considered him a hero after bringing Ayda home safely all those years ago, even though Elle had not been around, she had heard stories. Having never travelled this far north, the group marvelled at the river and the surroundings. Birds of the brightest blues and yellows nestled in the trees that lined the river, wild flowers towered over the grass, as though reaching for the sun. There were no paths to speak of, this part of their world was untouched and untamed. Sir Rakel explained that they were growing close to the border of the Wastes. People rarely ventured this far north, as there was nothing to visit. No villages, no business and no land for farming.‘Do many travel this way to reach the Temple?’ Theo asked once.‘No, for only very few people know the whereabouts of the Temple, only those who have access to Royal Maps. I have never seen it. Your Father told me we would find the Temple at the Source of the River.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘Did you not escort Father to the Temple when he was younger?’ Ayda asked.‘Good heavens no, he met with a Scholar who took him in, I believe him to be the last to have seen it.’‘The Temple is a library of records and knowledge,’ Ayda recalled, ‘The Elders pass down knowledge to the Scholars, who record it and study it. It is forbidden for any Scholar to share this information with anyone outside of the Temple. It is punishable by death.’‘Yes indeed.’ Sir Rakel nodded,‘So why did one of them take my Father in, if the Elders forbid magic?’‘I believe you will have to ask him that, as I will not pretend to know everything, I know my duty, that is all.’ Sir Rakel bowed his head.‘It will be heavily guarded then,’ Niall contributed, ‘How do you plan on getting us in?’‘I have been told to escort you to the Temple where we will be met by the Scholar.’ Sir Rakel blushed slightly.‘So, there is no plan. We just wait for the mystery Scholar who is breaking his most sacred rule. Sounds brilliant.’ Niall replied sarcastically, shooting an exasperated look at Ayda. Ayda was pleased to see the old Knight shift uncomfortably. This whole plan seemed foolish to her. Firstly, they were following and taking advice from a Protector who had betrayed them, trusting that his information and intentions were good. Secondly, they were waiting for an old man who had broken his oath to smuggle them in - and that was if the whole plan was not a fabrication to lure them into the hands of the Legion. Ayda saw defeat in both outcomes. Either Sir Rakel was lying and leading them to their enemy, or he was telling the truth, and the lameness of his plan lead them to their enemy. Ayda hated the whole plan. Elle, however, had complete and unwavering confidence in Sir Rakel. To her he was the Knight in her childhood story books. Ayda had promised to protect Elle, which meant following her into danger. By her side she would stay. They had grown tired and sore from riding and were now on foot, leading their horses along the meandering skirts of the river. Ayda’s leather boots were filthy, where they were once black on polished, they were now brown, but she was used to it. Trousers, armour, swords and dirt were common place when on Patrol and in the Barracks, she had called home. She felt comfortable in her tunic and ‘men’s clothes’ as Brielle and her Mother had once jibed. To her credit, Elle had not once complained about her attire. Ayda remembered the pale-pink lace dress she had last seen her little sister in. She closed her eyes and remembered the last time her family had been together. It felt so long ago. Brielle had been overjoyed with the feast, with the dancing and the dresses. She had bloomed in a carefree and childish way and revelled in the entertainment. Her Mother and Father had been flying so high and were so loved by everyone around them. Ayda felt the low sun warm her face as her emotions caught in her chest when she remembered how everyone had applauded and congratulated the family on Elle’s summons. The summons that had led to the end of life as they knew it. She caught her Father’s laughter in her mind and felt it heavy and painful but also beautiful and pure, it was too much to hold on to, she let it go. His laughter faded. Her heart was full of love for her family. She recollected her Father’s last words to her, the words she had thought so strange at the time, ‘she has every right to be scared… she will need her sister to guide her and protect her.’ Ayda realised that maybe her Father had known something was going to happen. Which meant that Sir Rakel could be telling the truth.‘Ayda, are you ok?’ Elle had appeared at her side, she had not realised she had fallen so far behind the group, Ayda had enjoyed swimming in the safe serenity of memory. Trying to retain the swelling in her heart she looked at her sister. Her strong, wonderful sister. Putting her arm around her she smiled.‘I’m fine, Elle, just remembering our Father.’ Ayda smiled.‘You don’t smile anymore,’ Elle pointed out, ‘It must be a good memory?’‘I don’t think I have any bad memories of Father,’ Ayda scrunched up her face trying to think.‘Well you’re lucky, I remember him emptying my chambers of dolls when I was small,’ Elle said cheerfully. Ayda knew she was joking, it warmed her heart. After everything, Elle was still able to encourage happiness. She was so much stronger than she appeared.‘To make room for new ones I remember!’ Ayda laughed, squeezing her treasure.‘Yes, it’s funny isn’t it?’‘What is?’‘To be so afraid that you have lost everything, to then realise you were always blessed with so much more.’ Elle said peacefully. Her little sister had grown into such a special young elf. She had always known Elle to be kind and sensitive, but she was now so much more than that. Her troubles and her pains had made Elle stronger, smarter and had opened her mind to potential. She had overcome so much that her confidence had enlightened her. Ayda saw her now, less as a child and more as a leader, a Princess who would one day make for the wisest of Queens. Theo called out to Elle and joyfully she ran to him. He had found something, it was cupped in his hand and when revealed, Elle had cried out in glee.‘She is an amazing little Elf.’ A voice said weakly. Ayda had been walking closer to the litter and realised she had heard some of the conversation with Elle.‘There was a moment when I was afraid of her.’ Ayda admitted painfully, walking up to the litter. Syren was doing well, she could not walk and was still very weak, but she was still with them and was still fighting, Ayda marvelled at her will. She hoped her friend would make the journey.‘I think we all were and still should be.’ Syren said. Ayda looked at her friend questioningly.‘She is young, and although wise and pure, she still lacks control.’ Syren explained, wincing slightly as she tried to move to a more comfortable position.‘She will master it.’ Ayda replied confidently.‘She spent a lot of time apologizing to me,’ Syren continued, ‘She felt guilty for hurting me, but she was also proud she was able to save you. She has become less afraid of herself I believe.’Ayda had noticed the change in her sister. Since the attack at the village, Elle had become more confident and was not as scared as she had been before. She had done what Ayda could not, she had grown with her trials, like ivy that spreads persistently higher, through weather and decay. Ayda could not help but feel angry with herself. She had been slightly older than Elle when she had ventured to Oaktown. The events there had changed her, crushed her, she knew that. Before that dreadful incident, she had been proud to be heir, and was excited at the prospect of being Queen. But since, all passion for leadership had died. She did not trust anyone, and worse, she no longer trusted herself. She had explained to her parents her plan to reject her claim to the throne. It had come as a shock, as they had had to, before, remind her that she was not yet Queen as she ran around barking commands as a child. Ayda had sworn to protect her loved ones and strengthen herself, so she would never fail as a friend again. No one had ever heard from her lips why she planned to give up her title, but most had guessed. Ayda had drowned in the guilt of leaving her friend behind, and even after so many years, still wallowed in it’s deep, dark waters. Reeds had wrapped around her ankles, tying her to remorse, never forgiving herself and never moving on. She couldn’t even say his name anymore and refused to remember his face. Ayda had believed this was the reason she was not worthy of the summons. She would not fail again. Growing up she had kept her circle of friends small, only ever playing with Brielle and training daily with Syren. They were all she needed, they were all she trusted. Anyone else would be shackles around her wrists, she feared love and she feared loss, after all she had endured. Regret must have greyed her face, as when Syren next spoke, it was to voice Ayda’s deepest fear.‘I think a time will come, when the world needs Elle, more than she needs us.’ Syren said quietly.‘I think that time is nearly upon us,’ Ayda nodded. She believed this deep down in her heart. Even worse, she believed that time was closer than they realised. Ayda had spent her life, mastering the art of combat so she could see of danger for her family. If her sister was to become a powerful mage, then what purpose did Ayda serve? Her whole life had been leading up to her becoming nothing, not even able to defend her family. And what of her sister? She had already exhibited signs of a great ruler. She was kind, she was smart, she inspired love and loyalty, even from humans! Ayda knew that Elle had a big part to play. Elle had magic. Ayda still had not fully grasped that magic had been dead to the world for centuries, the only known Mages were the Elders, and now suddenly, both the King and Elle had magic? Worse, the Elders had never sent the Legion Captains out to hunt a solitary Elf before. She had heard stories of the Legion supressing rebellion against their own authority, but that was rare. Something big was happening, Ayda was sure of it, and one day they would find the answers.",

      "content": "12 – ELLEIt was a relief to see Ayda smile again. Ayda had not been happy for as long as Elle could remember, she was always busying herself at the Barracks and never cared much for socialising, but she had never seen her so clouded. It had been a fine moment when Elle had noticed her sister and Niall progress, it seemed that Ayda had let go of whatever it was that had barricaded her into solitude. Elle knew there was more to that story. Ayda and Niall seemed so different around each other. Niall was usually cocky and playful when with her, Theo and Karl, yet with Ayda he was careful and nervous. Ayda also seemed more on edge and more prone to outbursts around him. She wondered on their story. Theo had made several comments over the course of the journey, about a potential history or deeper meaning and she was desperate to know more. What was it between them? She doubted it was love. Ayda simply could not bear to look at him before, she seemed to loathe him. She had been trying more recently though, Elle had guessed that might be because of what he had done for her and Syren. She was happy to see it, Ayda was certainly more approachable now. Elle was proud of her sister. Ayda had ran to her aid during the attack knowing full well that she stood no chance against a Captain of the Legion. The way Ayda was handling Syren’s injuries was encouraging too, her sister simply refused to believe Syren would leave her, and Syren seemed much stronger because of it. Syren. Her biggest regret. Wracked with guilt at the injuries her magic had caused, Elle had apologised repeatedly. Syren had instantly forgiven her and soothed her, explaining that it was necessary for the good of the team. How she wished she had shouted out to Syren not to strike him. But she couldn’t, if she had the Captain might have guessed her plan, and she was almost out of magic, so she couldn’t take the risk. The Princesses would never forget Syren’s sacrifice. She remembered the boy arriving to tell them of the attack on the village, and Brielle had wasted no time fighting Theo off, who had tried to stand in her way. She was never going to leave her sister to die. Surprising herself, she had arrived at the village, furious, but focussed. Her mind had been angry but clear, she was there to defend Ayda. Feeling strength in the knowledge that she could control magic, she felt more stable, and happier to be around her friends. She was less of a burden to them now, she thought. How much life had changed! Seeing Sir Rakel arrive on Trojan his huge black stallion had reignited a raging inferno through her blood. She had thought her family lost, but with his arrival she suddenly had her Knight in shining armour and her Mother returned to her. All was not lost! There was hope! The others did not trust him, she knew, she understood. But she did not let that dampen her elation, she had so few friends, but she cherished each of them and delighted in an ally returning to her. Sir Rakel had answered all her prayers, Mother was alive, Syren would be healed and she would learn how to be a Mage. How could she not trust him after he brought them such marvellous hope! She felt buoyed by the change in situation, she felt stronger, more powerful. She was a swan gliding over the beautiful hilltops, sun in the sky, and soon she would be flying home. It was bliss. Hope was the magic her soul had been starved of.‘How much longer?’ She asked the old Knight excitedly.‘I’m not sure Princess,’ Sir Rakel responded gently, ‘It is beginning to grow dark, we should stop soon.’ Elle was impatient to reach the Temple, she did not want to rest, she wanted to keep walking. The prospect of learning to control her magic enthused her. Then she would be able to return to her Mother with Ayda and protect them. It was all she desired. Sir Rakel was excellent company, Brielle found. He would tell her wonderful stories of his past, from when he was a child playing in the Castle with the young Prince, or when he was on an adventure with his comrades. He was wise, experienced and a legendary swordsman, which was how he became her Father’s Chief Protector. Elle often caught the suspicious glances thrown at him from her troop, whilst they pricked at her they could not puncture her joy. Let them distrust him, she thought, he would prove to be true. She knew it. Eventually they stopped, the team began to ready camp. Theo disappeared again, most likely to hunt which he seemed to excel at. Ayda set about the task of preparing Elle with somewhere comfy to sleep as she always did. Karl was readying a fire whilst Niall and Rakel aided Syren out of the litter and placed her gently next to the new born fire, wrapping her up in spare blankets. Elle believed Syren grew stronger every day, but the exchanges between her friends were never positive. Syren had not stood, or done much on her own since the accident, she had explained the night before that she could move her limbs, but it just pained her to do so, she could manage to slowly feed herself and drink, so that was a relief. Elle got the impression that Syren had put a middle finger up to death for now, and was clinging on with everything she had, digging her nails in to life. She hoped there wasn’t too much pain and prayed that the Scholar could fix her. When everyone was finished, they settled down, Theo returned with a fresh kill and began roasting it on the fire. Elle began to beg Sir Rakel for another story. She always enjoyed his stories. Tonight, he had promised her the story she had been waiting for. The story that gave rise to the Elders and destroyed Elven lands, known as the Wastes. Sir Rakel cleared his throat and began;“Centuries ago, Mages were at the height of power. Humans and Elves alike had an abundance of trained and skilled Mages. Both the Human and Elven Kings were impressive in their ability. Lords and ladies of both courts were awarded with wealth and titles dependent on their strength, as both Kings sought the strongest of allies. Tensions over land and wealth between humans and elves had always been high, many battles were fought with many deaths. The population possessing no magic were hit hardest, even though they outnumbered Mages greatly, they had no strength to stop them. Too often, normal people were attacked by opposing Mages in a brutal display of power designed to intimidate and threaten. The blood shed knew no bounds. Magic was used horrendously, to destroy rather than create. One day, the much-loved Princess Akaela of Elves disappeared mysteriously, and the Elven Mages were recalled by the King for a day of respectful Mourning and a ceasefire was agreed, leaving the outskirts of Myrliar unprotected. The Human King destroyed all towns outside of the Stone City, which sparked the fierce announcement of the Last War. The Elven King declared that all humans, Mage or not, would be burned from his Earth. Originally, only children of Mages or of Royalty were tested for magic at a young age, but with the prospect of war looming, all children were tested. Children of all ages with magic, were ripped from their screaming and crying mothers, and thrown into the roughest training. There was not a drop of magical blood unclaimed. Their numbers were evenly matched. After several months of brutal training and preparation, the Kings were done waiting. Blinded by his grief for his daughter, the Elven King commanded his Army to meet the opposition, thus the war began on his own land. His villages were mowed like grass, his farms and crops burned to ruin, and his people’s blood fed the cracked land of the North. Demoralised by all that they had lost, his Mages suffered, their focus was on the wreckage, on the loss of their own lands and people and the fruitlessness of war. Thousands of Mages died that day on both sides. By nightfall, only a handful of the strongest remained. An explosion of power ripped through the land, propelled by the remainder of the Human Mages who had combined the last of their magic in a desperate attack. The war was ended by four Elven Mages, who skilfully contained the blast and refocussed the power on the enemy. It was a feat of magic that had never been seen before, and even more impressive, they each still possessed more magic than an average Mage. The Elves had won at a devastating cost. The land for miles around had been scorched of all life, even the rubble and the ruins had turned to dust. What happened after, saw the rise of the Elders as we know them. The Humans continued as before, with magic obliterated from their race, the only Mage left was their King who had lost the love of his nation. The Elven King at first, remained protected by his four surviving Mages. The Four as they became widely known, used their magic to rebuild Myrliar and begin its slow recovery. Over time, the love for The Four surpassed the love of the King, and he was removed and imprisoned for crimes against his people. The Four were anointed as the chosen Leaders of the Elves. With their dominant power they reached gracious terms with the Human King, and the River Myr was set as a boundary between their two peoples. The Four reigned in peace, no more wars, no more battles. The Elves regained their strength, their villages were rebuilt, and their farms regrew. Magic, however, had disappeared entirely. Eventually when the King of Humans passed, the Four remained the only Mages left. Many believed magic to be a gift from the Earth, and when the Earth was devastated, the gift was revoked. The Four eventually secluded themselves more and more from their prosperity, believing their task complete and their country safe, and traced the old royal bloodline back to a young boy, and trained him to take back his throne. They became his most trusted advisors. One day when his heir was born, and the Elven population’s love was secured for their new King, The Four retired into their studies, and advised from a distance. Centuries later they are now known as The Elders and are still the biggest influence and the most powerful mages in the world. Magic has been extinct on both sides since the war, centuries ago… until your Father, and now you.” Sir Rakel added with pride.Silence followed his story, a story Elle, Ayda and Syren had been told different variations, but with the same basis. The Elders had saved them all, every Elf child in Myrliar was brought up on this story, the love and respect for the Elders was still the lifeblood of the Elven people, therefore so many had betrayed her family. When choosing between their Saviours and their King, they would choose the most powerful out of fear, or respect. Ayda’s face was scrunched up concentrating on the finer details of the story they were well versed in.‘We have always been told that the Elders have been our Saviours, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore,’ Elle shook her head sadly.‘They have a no tolerance approach when it comes to magic it seems.’ Theo said.‘But why? Surely if magic has been extinct for so long they would welcome its return?’ Elle asked.‘Unless they fear it,’ Syren added weakly, ‘Maybe they don’t believe in peace whilst magic exists?’‘I believe that is their fear.’ Sir Rakel responded.‘If magic has not existed for centuries, that doesn’t explain why their Captains all seem well skilled in magic.’ Ayda said quickly. It hit Elle like a stone. Of course, she had been so bogged down in the belief that her and her Father were the only Mages since the War, but they couldn’t possibly be, otherwise how did the Captains possess magic – and of course the mystery girl from the Ritual?‘Maybe there have been mages, and they have all been hunted down?’ Niall said slowly.‘No, I don’t think that’s possible.’ Sir Rakel dismissed.‘Why?’ Ayda asked, quickly.‘Because they couldn’t possibly keep that secret. People would soon start to turn on them if their loved ones were being murdered or going missing. They haven’t kept their hunt for Elle particularly quiet.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘He has a point,’ Syren piped up, ‘No-one has ever heard of magic being used, magic is dead to the population. If people were suddenly using magic and then disappearing, rumours would most certainly have spread.’‘And if Elven mages have been hunted down, that doesn’t explain the lack of magic in Humans,’ Karl added, after a thoughtful moment.‘Yes, we have never heard of magic before, and this story is completely new to us, as if it never happened. If Elf Mages are still around but being hunted, why does magic still not exist to humans?’ Theo contributed.‘Magic is still mostly dead, then.’ Ayda finished, seemingly agreeing with their hypothesis.‘I believe so,’ Sir Rakel said, ‘I can’t explain the Captains, but I have never ever heard word or seen magic in anyone other than the King and Princess Brielle.’‘As Chief Protector and Head of the Army, and closest friend to the King, you would have, I think.’ Ayda agreed, her tone was icy as she said the last part. No one failed to notice. Elle was convinced. Magic was still rare. Humans had never heard of it, and there were no rumours or mention of it anywhere other than history books.‘I can’t believe we have no knowledge of magic at home.’ Theo said sadly in disbelief.‘I can understand why you hate our race,’ Niall shook his head miserably, ‘Our King was scum. They arranged a ceasefire and he took advantage of it. He killed so many innocents.’‘Neither side was innocent.’Shock materialised on every single face around the fire. Open mouths and wide eyes greeted the speaker. Syren had finally accepted the truth. There was no innocent party in war. When war is declared, all combatants accepted the knowledge that innocent blood would be shed. Lives lost was the currency of war. Lives lost was the reason, no one ever really won a war. Syren had finally realised that Elves were not innocent, and that both shared responsibility, and most importantly, that the three humans before her, the three humans that helped her, were not defined by their race, they were themselves.‘Well now you have to live, because I’m starting to like you.’ Theo laughed, patting her on the shoulder playfully.‘We were wrong to steal from your people,’ Niall said remorsefully.‘Why did you join the Fiends?’ Ayda asked critically.‘After I lost my Pa, the Fiends took me in,’ Niall revealed sadly, ‘They were my family, the Fiends only steal to help those who needed it.’‘Mostly.’ Karl added under his breath, with a wink from Theo.‘Why did you join the Army?’ Niall asked gently, his eyes locking with Ayda’s. Her mouth opened, and closed, Elle thought she would answer, but Ayda decided against it, she busied herself sharpening her blade and separated herself from the conversation. This piqued Elle’s curiosity. Ayda had never given a proper answer when someone asked that question, her simple answer was ‘for the people I love’ but Elle thought there was more to it than that. Tonight, her suspicions were confirmed, there was more to it than that, and Niall had nearly got it out of her. That night, the merriment was undeniable in the camp, Elle was happier that she had been in a while. A sense of peace had settled like a comfortable sheet upon them. The group had grown to respect each other, finally, after the near miss at the town, they were able to see past the differences in race and could move on together, stronger than before. Hope was bright between them too. For the first time, each of them was thinking of home, and soon talk turned to what they were looking forward to, rather than the fears they were sure to face.The next morning, they rose early, keen to get a head start on the day. Elle sat peacefully by the river whilst her friends packed up camp ready to leave. Watching the flow of water spiral and twirl energetically downstream, Elle decided to use the moment for practice. She remembered fearing magic. Remembered watching her Father fight to the death with the Captain. Remembered turning wolves into ash. Remembered accidentally boiling the lake and harming Syren. But now she had hope. She had saved Ayda. She had saved her friends by using magic. She could not fear that power now, knowing that the power she held, if mastered, could protect all those she loved from dying. Wondering what she should practice doing, Elle considered the world around her. The sun was rising slowly, casting tremendous shadows across the ground as the sun framed the landscape. Birds were singing their beautiful morning song, and the soft trickle of water soothed her senses. She felt at peace. Were there limits to her power? Where should she begin? Deciding she should start off with something useful, something less dangerous, Elle focussed on a small, broken twig on the ground next to her. She willed it to move. No response. She pictured in her mind the twig rolling further from her and attempted to push the vision towards it. No response. Elle frowned. How had she managed to fight off a trained Mage if she couldn’t even move a twig?!‘Are you OK?’ A hard voice whispered behind her. Sir Rakel had come to get her. Brielle nodded in frustration. Sir Rakel sighed and crouched down beside her.‘You were practicing?’‘How’d you guess?’ Elle replied.‘This twig isn’t interesting enough to be glared at for as long as you were.’ Sir Rakel laughed softly, twirling it between his fingers.‘What were you trying to do?’ He continued.‘Move it,’ Elle whispered sadly, ‘But I couldn’t.’ Sir Rakel nodded, seeming to understand.‘Being a Mage isn’t easy,’ He advised, ‘I remember the first time I suspected your Father had magic.’‘How’d you know?’‘We were practicing archery, your Father was a bit of a sore loser, when his arrows failed to hit the mark next to mine, he accidentally lit it and sent it soaring through an open window in frustration.’ Sir Rakel chuckled at the memory.‘Did he master it quickly?’ Elle asked, lightened by her Father’s failures in the face of her own.‘No, I think he struggled with it. He mentioned several times about feeling the flow of magic. Maybe you should concentrate on that?’ Sir Rakel suggested. Elle scrunched her face up in annoyance. She couldn’t feel magic now. She had only felt the flow of magic when it consumed her and exploded from her hands. Her hands! Raising a hand, she stretched out to the twig in Sir Rakel’s hand willing it to fly, it zoomed from his hand and into hers easily. Sir Rakel applauded happily. Elle was astounded. Was it really that easy?‘Did you understand that?’ Sir Rakel prompted. Elle shook her head. Apart from raising her hand, she didn’t understand what had been different. Sir Rakel invited her to try again. This time she paid closer attention to the magic. She had a split-second view. She noticed as she made her decision, the smallest specks of white light had flowed from her hand and disappeared into the air. It excited her. She wondered if that was it, if that was her magic.‘Can you see that?’ Elle asked eagerly, she explained the white light to Sir Rakel, who shook his head. Elle tried a few more times, each time the flow of light specks was the same. She became used to seeing them and decided to keep an eye on them when using magic in the future. Eventually the other’s joined them impatient to move on. Each of them was excited when they heard that Elle had gotten the confidence to practice. Following the river north, they grew closer and closer to the outskirts of the wastes.‘So, these flecks of light,’ Niall asked, when the party had started walking, ‘Have you not noticed them before?’‘I think I have seen them before, during the Ritual.’ Elle explained.‘You think?’‘Well, there were more of them, and much stronger lights, they almost blinded me. These ones are quite difficult to see.’‘But Sir Rakel couldn’t see them?’ Niall asked. Elle shook her head.‘Maybe only Mages can see them?’ Theo asked. Elle remembered asking her Father what the lights were. He couldn’t see them either. She explained this to her friends. They were baffled. Elle was sure it had something to do with her magic, but if her Father was a skilled Mage, why could he not see them?",

      "content": "13 – NIALLDays passed, and the group continued north, following the path of the river. Sir Rakel had instructed that they were to find the source of the River, but even he didn’t seem to know what to expect. The journey had been a roller coaster for Niall and his fellow Fiends. He looked back to the wet and stormy night and wondered how on earth they had become so entwined in the fate of this young elf. He should have turned back with the rest of the clan! Niall sighed deeply. Looking back at the young face of the blonde-haired elf trailing behind him, and the determined grit in the eye of her older sister, he knew there was no where he’d rather be. The journey had changed everything. He had realised how different, and yet how very similar humans and elves were. They shared a story, a past, a fate, but the humans knew nothing of it. He had had no idea of the scale of the bloodshed between the two peoples, no idea that the deep hatred shared by all was born of a centuries old war. Then there was magic! Stories of magic were unheard of throughout humanity. There was rumour and speculation that the King’s Spirit God was magically blessed, but the majority believed this to be a ludicrous tale. Could it be true? Could magic return to humans the way it had returned to the Elves? Niall had felt himself change, he was unsure. Everything to him had been so clear before, but now the water was muddied. Ayda had been so strong and fierce when she had stumbled into his childhood, and she had remained alive in his thoughts. Being with her again, as if by fate, had changed him. He was no longer care free and playful, but worried and protective. He would find himself glimpsing at her, and his heart threatened to jump from his chest whenever she smiled. There was only one person who could make her smile. The Princess was a marvel, Niall thought, throughout all she had been through, she was tough. The quiet, timid Elf that had crawled afraid from the wreckage of her home, had emerged like a soldier, passionate and ferocious. He enjoyed watching her practise her magic. He laughed at her when she pouted in frustration and swelled with pride when she failed but persevered, until she won.‘It can’t be much longer now?’ Ayda suggested, striding up to walk alongside him. Ayda had been much kinder to him of late. Since he had stood by Syren he noticed. He supposed he would be the same, had someone done that for one of his brothers. He looked at the back of their heads fondly. What would he do without them? Karl and Theo were ever the same, they were the foundation of his home. He watched them lead the group onwards, Karl ever silent, patiently listening to whatever rubbish Theo was telling him this time. He knew Karl longed for home, but loyalty kept him by Niall’s side.‘I hope not, everyday seems to leave us with more questions.’ Niall replied. He saw Ayda glimpse at him from the corner of her eye. The frustration drove them on, every truth seemed to multiply into more questions. Questions whirled through his head in a never-ending list, he could not imagine how Elle must feel, as most of the answers reflected her destiny.‘You… never told me,’ Ayda whispered hesitantly, ‘How you knew about the tunnel back at home?’ Niall recoiled. He wasn’t ready to tell her that, he wasn’t sure he would ever be. Was it worth adding to the confusion that weighed on everyone like an anchor as they trudged through the marsh? Everything was complicated enough, he didn’t need to contribute any more to that. He refused to answer believing it to be for the best. He caught Theo regarding him sadly from the distance. Niall could not accept it yet, he had hidden those feelings, drowned them over the years, it was not the right time. It was never the right time.‘You never told Princess Brielle what happened?’ Niall asked Ayda. It was her turn to wince.‘I have never spoken of it, Rakel knows of course, as did my Mother and Father, but not Elle.’‘Why?’‘My job is to protect her, I failed him, I will never fail her.’ Ayda replied simply, the cold memory gleaming like ice in her eyes.‘You did not fail him. There was nothing you could do, we were children. You need to forgive yourself.’ Niall replied. Ayda sighed.‘He only went to Oakwood Town to protect me, he tried everything to stop me going, if I’d have listened…’‘Then I wouldn’t be here to help you now.’ Niall interrupted. Their eyes connected, the piercing blue of her eyes shone brightly as before. Niall felt his heart thump against his ribcage. It was true, he thought, if he had not met her all those years ago, she would have killed him at the barn, and he would never have protected her. As it was, now, he would do almost anything for her, but he couldn’t let her know, there was too much at stake.‘After all I’ve put you through, it’s a wonder you have stuck around.’ Ayda smiled sadly.‘I vowed to protect your sister, and I feel as though there is more for me to learn about my people’s magic.’ Niall replied with a protected half-truth. Ayda nodded understandingly, muttering something about Syren she disappeared behind him to check her friend. Syren was laid lifelessly in the litter led by Sir Rakel. There was a time, when they had all believed she had overcome the worst of her injuries, but she had since rapidly deteriorated. Sir Rakel had mentioned internal injuries, and expressed everyone’s worst fears, Syren was dying. This had affected Ayda and Brielle the most. Brielle was racked by guilt and spent a lot of her time with Syren, talking to her empty form, Niall knew that the loss Brielle had suffered was a catalyst for her, fuelling her desire to master control. Ayda had become less hostile. She no longer had the energy to fight or argue with Sir Rakel and spent a lot of her time in silence. When she did speak, she was thoughtful and kind, as if she was grateful for their help with Syren but prepared for the worst, waiting for the eternal hand of death to rip more joy from her life.The river they followed was the only constant in their days. It seemed to flow through a never-ending countryside. The Myr River divided the land in two, with the Elves habiting the west and the humans populating the east. It felt strange to Niall that he was within sight of his homeland. He knew Oakwood Town and The Hole was far behind them, near the centre of the region, and as much as he was sure of his path, he yearned for home. He hadn’t spoken to the rest of the Fiends since the night of the raid, and he wondered what became of them. Had Bryce sent out a search party for them or did he know what had happened? Niall wasn’t sure it was a good idea to send a message, if the Elders or Legion learnt anything from the communication it could risk everything. He couldn’t handle the thought of bringing the Legion to the Fiends doorstep, he was sure they could handle themselves against armed opponents, but they would be easy prey to any Mage the Legion sent.They continued north. The forest that surrounded them grew sparse. Across the river the forest was as dense and dark as it had always been, they had not seen a town or village for a long time, the north was abandoned. The landscape of Myrliar was changing, the trees of the forest had slowly been disappearing the further they moved, and they would often travel hours before seeing anything green. The ground beneath their feet had been steadily shifting from a delicious, healthy foliage underfoot into what could only be described as dust and sand. They had entered the outskirts of the wastes. Sir Rakel had promised that by following the river they would avoid going through the dry, dangerous land of the wastes. It had been a good idea, Niall agreed. Ayda had been intent on hiding in the wastes, but from a distance, Niall could not see how they would have survived. If the stories were true, then the centuries old magic had parched the land, destroying all in its radius. The nutrients from the earth were scorched, and no life could grow there. There were no plants, no grass, not even weeds. There were no lakes, or ponds or streams from which to source water, and there were no animals hiding in the missing growth. They would not have survived long. Ayda had explained that she hadn’t realised the extent of deprivation of the wastes and muttered a resentful thanks to Sir Rakel for insisting on changing the flawed plan. On the outskirts however, not much changed. The trees and grass were few and far between and there wasn’t much in the way of wild life. Before they had foraged berries and fruit and hunted animals in the wealthy green lands, but now they heavily depended on the river. The river provided sustenance. Fish and water surrounded them, and occasionally they would spot an animal drinking from the river. Elle had become adept at using her magic to trap their next meal, without her it would have been much more difficult. The biggest worry for the group was how visible they had become. They had moved away from the protection and shelter of the thick undergrowth and tall trees and were now visible from any distance. They felt sure they must be spotted, but no-one had a resolution, so they were forced to grit their teeth and continue. Karl had suggested the team split, to deceive any potential trackers, but Elle had decided against this, she believed it imperative that they stuck together. The silence in the group had grown tense, the physical and mental exhaustion was taking its toll on each of them. Everyone was too polite. Laughter had forsaken them, the team had too many woes and too many questions spinning them into a knot that each had decided they were better in silence. Niall spent most of his time with Theo and Karl, it confused him too much to be around Ayda. Her pain was too much for him to bear, he wanted to comfort her, and hold her, as he had always wanted, but he couldn’t allow it. There was too much confusion, they needed clear boundaries and friendship was so much easier than the hurt he could cause. Elle was so intent on her training and with Sir Rakel hauling Syren along, he took solace in the company of his brothers. Just the three of them, how he liked it. Or so he thought.‘You should just tell her.’ Theo had urged. Niall had become skilled at acting deaf whenever the subject of Ayda arose.‘We – me and Karl – know how much she means to you, you never stopped going on about her when we were kids, how many times did you spy on her?’ Theo had jibed.‘It’s not that simple.’ Niall had snapped, attempting to douse his annoyance and end the conversation.‘Course it is, we could die any day, you should tell her.’‘It’s complicated. Even more so now.’ Niall replied quietly. He hated himself for saying it, but he couldn’t shake the truth. He knew what tore at her, he knew that she had lost her friend and that she wore the guilt round her neck like a noose. He understood that it fuelled her instincts of protection towards her family. There was no room for anything else in her life. From what he had seen, she had starved herself of almost everything she was at risk of losing, with the only exception of her small sister. He felt pity for her. She had spent her whole upbringing since losing her Jonas, training herself and she had put every ounce of guilt and sorrow into becoming a weapon for the protection of those she loved but Niall saw her eyes every time Elle mastered something new. She was pleased that her sister could defend herself, but she also felt as he did, surplus to requirements. Elle was able to defend herself and had shown that she didn’t really need them. Karl had pointed this out several times and pushed his will to go home. But Niall would not relent, for some reason he knew that she would need them, and he was sure as hell going to be here when she did. For Elle. For Ayda. But he could not forget his fear, a fear that had grown within him when he first saw the small elf lose control of her power.Their clothes were dusty and chalky by the time they reached the tree line, he found himself amused by the fact that he could no longer tell where his boots stopped, and the ground started. Finally, they had reached the final stage of their walk. Sir Rakel had explained the forest was smaller than the last and that soon they would be able to see the Three Thorn Mountains. Niall hoped they would not have to climb the mountain and prayed that the Temple of Scholars would be easily accessible, as he didn’t think the troupe had enough energy left following the weeks of hiking and rough sleeping. The trees were ancient. Knots and awkward limbs spouted all around them like veins underneath thin skin, the wood creaked tiredly as the wind bristled through the trees’ outstretched arms. Looking up, the sky was hidden beneath layers of thick green leaves giving the surrounding forest a natural cover from the elements. Not much further, he thought to himself with every groaning step… not much further.",

      "content": "14 – ELLEElle gasped as she took in the sight before her. The Three Thorn Mountains stood higher than the clouds and wider than she could see. The Pearl White Mountains of her home felt unimpressive, compared to the mass of sharp grey rock glaring down on her. She was an insect gazing up at the tower of jagged rock, she strained her head as far back as she could, taking in the sheer size of the monstrous formation, and felt herself stumble backwards, dizzied by its formidable magnitude. She knew that no one could ever have climbed these Mountains, they were too deadly and there was no route through or over. The Three Thorns Mountains was named for its three peaks, that she knew from old maps she had been shown, but their reach extended deep into the sky. Sounds of wonder came from her companions, knowing she wasn’t the only one seeing it for the first time, she took a moment to examine her friend’s reactions. Ayda was stood transfixed, a great image of the Thorns reflected in her eye. Niall and Theo were gazing in wonder, mouths agape, for the first time ever, they were silent, even Sir Rakel was intimidated by the colossus. Snow covered the teeth of the mountains and thick white clouds buried the summits. Elle’s eye was drawn to a glint in the mountain face to the right of her. Like a magpie, she searched for the source of the shimmer. An artery had burst from deep within the Mountains, and water had broken free of its restraints through a crack in its skin. Now that she had noticed the great waterfall smashing its route through the rock, she could hear the song of flowing water beneath the deafening sound of tumbling water. This waterfall had given birth to the Myr River, the lifeblood of the mountain had been dividing the Elven and Human Race for centuries. Examining the vast Mountains, Brielle noticed there was a worrying lack of something. The Temple.‘Where is it?’ She asked Sir Rakel, he shook his head.‘I don’t know, your Father always said to follow the river, I’ve never seen it.’ He explained, as confused as she was. Elle sighed, now what? Ayda had snapped out of her stupor.‘I knew it,’ She snarled, pushing Sir Rakel away from Brielle, ‘You’ve lured us here, into the open, for no reason! Traitor!’‘Stop it.’ Elle said weakly, without conviction. She felt disappointed. She felt lost. What was the plan now, they had no idea where the Temple was!‘No Elle, you can’t stick up for him! We’re in the wide open, we’ve run out of supplies, Syren has been unconscious for days and we know we’re being hunted. He’s lured us into a trap!’ Ayda snapped aggressively. Elle had nothing to say. She felt cold to the core, Sir Rakel had been a light in her dark world with his plans and his insight, but he had let her down. She feared the worst, desperation crashed over her like a wave. Had Ayda been right all along, was Sir Rakel really her enemy? The Old Protector looked abashed, shocked and hurt. Ayda was stood facing him anger burning through her, searing great holes in him, he looked lost.‘Look! Someone’s there!’ Niall announced to the group. Elle spun around to where Niall was pointing. Sure enough, a small figure in the distance could be seen walking quickly along the river towards the mountains. It seemed he had been nestled behind a cluster of trees at the base of the fall. Elle watched with interest as he quickly and confidently climbed over rocks and disappeared into the mountain.‘Where was he going?’ Elle wondered.‘Maybe there’s an entrance there?’ Sir Rakel said eagerly, looking hopefully at Elle.‘Or maybe this is part of your trap!’ Ayda smacked him brutally.‘Ayda!’ Elle wailed.‘If I had wanted her dead she’d be dead by now!’ Sir Rakel said, his tone fierce, ‘This Temple is our only lead and I want to find it as much as you!’ Elle had already made up her mind. She had to find the Temple. She was tired of the bickering and the arguments. Leaving the others behind, she briskly set off towards the rocks. Theo and Karl followed her dutifully. The ground beneath her feet was unstable and uneven. Patches of grass could be seen dotted closer to the river but mostly the ground before her was layered with rock and dust, she felt as though she was trekking across the roots of the Mountains. She heard the wheels of Syren’s transport crunch behind her and the clicking of hooves against rock and guessed her team was with her now. Looking back over her shoulder she could see the outline of the Forest beyond the wastes that had been her shelter for a long time. She was leaving the luscious, fertile lands for a dry, chalk-like future.‘Are you sure about this Princess?’ She heard Niall say as he came alongside her.‘I need to find the Temple, it’s worth the risk.’ She nodded. She couldn’t believe how much she was hoping for Sir Rakel to be right. She wanted more than anything to find a pathway, or a door, anything that might lead her to the Temple. The Temple held her answers, she was so sure of that and she had become so dependent on finding it and finding herself. She was so close, she could feel it. It had been a long road, a long journey to get here, they had been through so much. She could hardly remember the carefree elf she had been, she could barely remember the faces of her friends back at the Stone Castle. All she knew now, was that she had a fight coming, and Elle couldn’t afford to be a scared child anymore. The mountain was drawing close, Elle had to steady herself to stop herself breaking into a run. Those at the front began climbing. Walls of rock framed the base of the mountain, Niall helped Elle over the bigger ones, with Sir Rakel close behind, ready to catch her. Finally, they reached the rock where the man had disappeared behind.‘Wait, Princess!’ Sir Rakel demanded, as Elle began the final climb. Elle faltered and looked at him.‘It should be me to go first…’ Sir Rakel began.‘Like hell!’ Ayda sneered, catching up with them, ‘Like we’d give you a chance to announce us!’‘I failed your Father, I will not fail you now, please,’ Sir Rakel ignored Ayda, his eyes bored into Elle’s determined glare, ‘I have brought you this far.’ Elle nodded and stepped aside to clear the rock for the Protectors ascent. With a few grunts and clinks of his golden armour, the old Elf hauled himself over with his strength and disappeared. Ayda glared darkly at Elle. Brielle knew she had angered her sister. At every turn she and Ayda had disagreed. Ayda had been furious at the group’s acceptance of the ‘traitor’ and could not forgive him for the loss of their Father. Elle had more hope than that. She had hope that this Protector, who she had once loved as an Uncle, was still that same Elf now. The little Princess had not been ready to abandon him, she had lost too much already. The litter that contained Syren had been hidden behind rocks with the remaining horses, too cumbersome to heave through the maze of rock that they had struggled to climb over. Karl and Theo had volunteered to stay with her. Elle feared for Syren, they were running out of time, Elle guessed her friend would not hold on for much longer, she was surprised she had made it this far. It felt like they waited an age, Ayda had started pacing, glaring at the spot Sir Rakel had last been stood as if he were still there. A few times she had mentioned to the others about running, and leaving him, but Elle was adamant she was staying, this was their best hope, she was sure of it. Finally, the crunch of grit reached her, and she knew he had returned, his old face appeared over the rock and he was beaming.“Come quickly!” He gestured, disappearing once more. With that each of them clambered over the rock, Elle as the smallest, stumbling slightly on the climb. Ayda’s eyes were cautious, wandering and scanning every inch of their surroundings, her hand never leaving her sword. Sliding down the face of the rock, Elle hit the ground hard, grit scraping the skin on her palms. A father like hand lifted her from her fall, Sir Rakel was smiling from ear to ear. His eyes moved to a point behind her and she followed his gaze, noticing Niall and Ayda were also following closely. A cloaked man stood in the entrance of a shadowy cavern, a jagged mouth in the wall had been concealed by the rocks they had climbed. His face was masked by the dark shadow cast by his hooded cloak, which was shabby, torn and frayed at the hem. Elle wondered if this was the man they had followed, but realised, as he moved closer, that this man was much older and very frail. His hand shook violently on his stick as he approached them. He drew close and he lowered his hood. Elle bit back a gasp. The man was old, and he was human. His eyes were a pure and brilliant white, staring unmoving a spot behind her head. He was blind she realised. His head was full of thick grey hair and his beard framed his broad chin.‘Princess Brielle, Princess Ayda. Follow me.’ He said. Elle was soothed by his voice. If she had known her Grandfather, this is how she would like him to sound. His voice was warm, and full of timeless wisdom. Ayda stepped before her before Elle could follow the Old Man into the cavern.‘You’re just going to trust him?’ Ayda asked, incredulously.‘Yes.’ Elle said simply.‘How can you trust so blindly, after all that has been?!’‘Stay if you wish. I’m going in.’ Elle shrugged. She was tired of fighting this battle. The Old Man was frail, blind and warm hearted, and she found she trusted him like an old friend. Shrugging, Elle gestured to Sir Rakel who took the lead, and followed him. Brielle guessed that Ayda and Niall had followed as she heard their footsteps echo through the cavern behind her. It wasn’t as dark as she had feared, the walls of the cavern had been chiselled smooth and circular holes had been carved out of the walls to let the light in. It was more of a stone corridor than a mountainous tavern. Stone masons had taken great care with this walkway, the walls were smooth, the floors were level and the windows were perfectly positioned and sized to let in light and be unnoticeable from the outside. Elle marvelled at the skill of the Old Man, being blind did not seem to hinder him in the slightest as he traced his stick along the base of the walls. Although they had caught up with him quickly and were eager to reach their destination, they patiently followed him through the cavern. Karl and Theo could be heard hauling Syren’s stretcher behind them, much to Elle’s relief. She could not suffer to lose any of her friends. On they walked, reaching an incline, their walk became slower still as they followed the corridor higher up the mountain, still surrounded by neatly cut rock. As they climbed higher with the gradient, a rush of water grew louder and louder, resonating through the cavern, until they could no longer hear their footsteps echoing around them. Ahead of them, a dim light was visible as the exit of the corridor approached. Leaving the tunnel, Elle marvelled in amazement at the beauty flowing through the mountain. They had reached the top of the waterfall. To her right she had a view across Myrliar and the Human lands. She could see the stretches of forests and even the wastes they had not long left. The trail of the River Myr meandered into the distance. A large pool of water lay before her, each droplet of fluid waiting to breach the mountain and plunge into the river below. To the left, Elle could see several smaller streams that fed the pool and, in the distance, was a sight that took her breath away. The Temple. The streams reflected light far in to the cave, beyond that, torches were blazing lighting up the most amazing building she had ever seen. The Old Man had stopped near the exit of the corridor, he was smiling.‘Welcome to the Temple of Scholars,’ He said, chuckling, ‘I remember the first time I laid my eyes on it too, it is something you have to see to believe - and even then, you may have to pinch yourself.’ That was certainly true, Elle thought. She could never have guessed from outside that this could have been built within the Mountain itself. The torches lit up a magnificent collection of interconnected domes carved from the Mountain. The Temple, although not taller than the Stone Castle once was, it was wider and in the dark, when lit purely by torches, had a magical feel to it. Bridges of rock were formed over the flowing streams and she could make out lit paths in the distance far from their position.‘Is this the only route in?’ Sir Rakel asked the Old Man, looking around.‘No, this is the back entrance, very few know of it, and even fewer can climb the other side,’ The Old Man chuckled again, ‘There are two main entrances, much grander, but both watched. This is the best way to keep you unnoticed.’ The Old Man gestured for them to follow and led them along the glistening pool of water.‘Are we not going into the Temple?’ Ayda asked from behind.‘Good heavens no, you’d be killed on sight.’‘Because the Scholars work with the Elders?’ Elle asked.‘Not all, but most.’ The Old Scholar sighed,‘Why don’t you?’‘Because I know something they don’t.’ he signalled for them to keep quiet. In the cave, sound travelled easier and quicker through the air, and along the water. They had to remain unnoticed. Their guide led them closer to the Temple, keeping to the shadows of the rocky cave. Elle wondered how the Scholar knew where the shadows were but said nothing as she followed closely. The Temple grew more impressive the closer they moved, the domes were smooth, and Elle could make out intricate gold detail patterned along the walls of each building. Elaborate decorative archways marked entrances and huge golden doors emitted a yellow glow from the flickering torches. Closer still Elle could see the reflection of the lights in the streams flowing around the domes, the floors nearer to the Temple were painted gold with gemstones sunk into the floor like mosaics. She had never seen such a sight of splendour. Red cloaks could be spotted prowling the exterior. The Legion had the Temple of Scholars heavily guarded. The Old Man was right, they would all be snuffed out as quick as a candle if seen. Elle found herself growing nervous the closer they moved. Butterflies were flapping their wings furiously in the pit of her stomach. Their guide was an expert at moving in the shadows, she wondered how he could see. Soon, they found themselves moving away from the Temple and away from the danger that came with it. Finally, they reached a strong oak door imbedded in a rough wall of rock. Elle spotted many tens of similar doors nearby and hoped no-one would appear from them. A click of a lock, the oak door was open, and they were ushered quickly and quietly inside. Elle had not realised how cold she was until the warmth of the fire embraced her. They had walked into a cosy room, that she presumed was the Scholar’s living quarters. Cosy armchairs relaxed in front of the simmering fire, bookcases lined the walls of the room, thousands of books nestled on their shelves. A large table was positioned against a stone wall, burdened heavily with parchment, more books and odd bits of strange coloured stone. Two oak doors led off the room to the Scholar’s bedchamber and private quarters. Groaning slightly, the Old Man locked the door and sidled into the room, and slowly lowered himself into his favourite armchair before the fire, breathing heavily.‘Your friend is dying.’ He said sadly, cutting in before they could speak.‘Can you help her?’ Ayda asked desperately.‘I can’t,’ He replied, ‘But I know someone who may be able to help.’ He took his walking stick in his hand and knocked three times on the cracked slate hearth surrounding the fire. The sound echoed slightly. Elle watched expectantly, waiting for something to happen. She could sense the anticipation of her friends around her, all staring patiently at the old slate. Maybe he was crazy? Elle thought. What was he hoping to happen? Suddenly, the sound of grinding stone on slate filled her ears, as the fragmented slate lifted away from the hearth, revealing a dark stairwell leading down. Elle’s curiosity got the better of her as she moved closer and peered in through the gap in the floor. The gap was small enough to let one person through at a time. In the dark, the stone stairs leading into the dark belly beneath them looked difficult, they would need to be careful. Elle looked back at the Old Man who had not moved at all.‘Go on, Princess.’ He nodded at her.‘How can we trust you? We don’t know you!’ Ayda cautioned Elle.‘Right now, your friend doesn’t have time for me to explain. If you want to save her, move.’Could she trust him? She thought, her confidence in him wavering slightly. Was she about to walk willingly into a trap? A prison that she had just watched open? The Old Man had said they could help Syren, was this a risk worth taking? The faded appearance of her red headed friend pushed her on. Waiting until Ayda was by her side, she carefully stepped on to the stone and began her descent. The steps were uneven, she lost her footing early on. Putting her hands out either side to touch the wall as a guide, she made her way lower and lower. She wondered if it would be safer for her to crawl down on her bottom but decided against it. Her friends had followed her down, she could hear their boots as they too, slipped on the deceiving ground. It wasn’t as dark as she thought, small candles were flickering in their sconce, casting dim, golden light to dance warmly along the cold walls. Finally, she reached the bottom. She gasped. She wanted to run far, far away from this place, she shimmied backwards into her sister, who groaned and moved her aside.‘What’s wrong with you?’ Ayda asked, looking down at Elle’s expression of shock.‘This-this place!’ Elle stammered, the rest of the group piled into the room, Syren being carried along by Karl and Theo. Brielle could not take her eyes from the large domed room. Every inch of stone was covered in glistening crystal, everywhere her eyes scanned, from the floors, to the ceiling, the crystals glittered like stars against the dark stone. It tugged at her deep inside, it looked so familiar…‘Bring her in, bring her in!’ A young female voice sounded rushed. Brielle jumped as she saw a young woman, about the same age as Ayda emerge from an archway at the end of the dome, and frantically gesture to them. Karl and Theo quickly carried Syren as gently as possible across the empty dome and through the archway. The other’s followed quickly. Elle was left alone. They did not understand the significance of this room, she thought. To her, it felt, like a dark version of home. Like she had been here before.‘This room is familiar to you?’ The Old Man was at her side, she had been caught in her reverie and had not heard him emerge.‘Yes…’ Brielle responded quietly, ‘It’s the Ritual Chamber back at home.’She had remembered why it caused her such fear, such a deep ache. To her, the Ritual Chamber of her home had caused all the misery that followed, she wished she had never stepped foot in the chamber. She had been such a fool to be so excited about her summons, and she had lost everything in doing so.‘Look closer at the crystals.’ The Old Man said simply. Reluctantly, Elle got closer to the walls beside her. The crystals were an inch or so wide, jagged and dotted in the stonework across the walls, floors and ceiling. They were also black. A deep, beautiful ebony. Her breath hitched. They were not the same. She remembered the crystals in the Castle Chamber as being clear as water.‘What are they?’ She asked, feeling more at ease in the mysterious dome.‘They are my most important discovery,’ The Old Man said seriously, ‘soon I will tell you of them, but for now, promise me, that you will not use magic unless instructed by myself.’Elle’s curiosity piqued. His most important discovery?‘Why are you helping us?’ Elle asked,‘Your Father made me promise, besides, I would have anyway. You are far too important.’She opened her mouth to press the Scholar for more, until she saw Ayda and Sir Rakel beckon her enthusiastically from the archway. Remembering Syren, she ran to them without looking back. Ayda looked at her happily. ‘You are not going to believe this!’ Ayda beamed. Brielle felt elated at her sister’s excitement, what had they found? The Princess followed her sister into the room beyond the archway, it was like the last, black crystals adorned every inch of the smaller, domed room. Much like the living room they had left, this room also had books lining the walls and scrolls and parchment along desks and shelves. Amazement shook her body as she saw what was happening in the centre. Her friends had gathered around a table, their faces were pale, and their eyes were wide as they contemplated what they were seeing. Elle felt the hair on her arms and neck stand up, as shock crawled over her body like a spider.Syren was led peacefully on the table, but she was glowing. Brielle could not move, she knew that glow. She had been practising her magic and seen that white light so many times. Magic was flowing through Syren! The white light was so bright that Elle nearly missed the hands resting upon Syren’s body. Following the arms, squinting against the gleam, she noticed that the hands belonged to the young lady who had called them. Her eyes hurt, the glare from the light was strong in the dark, underground rooms, she raised her hand to shield herself. Ayda immediately noticed.‘What’s wrong?’ She asked worried, placing a hand on her shoulder.‘The light – it’s too bright!’ Elle whispered.‘I knew she was going to heal her, but I didn’t know she had magic!’ Ayda exclaimed wide-eyed. The light pierced her eyes for mere moments before she adjusted. Finally, able to focus without wincing through the pain, Elle moved closer to examine what was happening. Elle watched as beads of light emerged from the outstretched hands of the healer and disappeared into Syren’s body, Elle could see that much magic was being used as Syren’s body glowed. The healer’s eyes were scrunched shut in concentration and only opened once the glow had begun to dim. She had finished. Elle looked at Syren’s face expectantly. The magical light dimmed to nothing as the healer pulled away from her body. Syren still did not move.‘What happened? Didn’t it work?’ Elle asked timidly, waiting for Syren’s eyes to burst open.‘The Magic can only do so much, little one, her body now needs to do the rest.’ The lady replied.‘What did you do?’ Ayda asked, approaching cautiously, afraid of the unknown.‘She had internal injuries that caused her to gradually lose a lot of blood, much longer and she would be lost.’‘Now what?’‘Now we wait for her body to recuperate and replenish itself. All her injuries are healed,’ The healer explained, ‘Now, if you would be so kind, please settle her in that room behind you.’ She gestured to the small arch leading off the dome. Karl and Theo obligingly carried her into the room. Elle felt a rush of relief, that was mirrored on Ayda’s face, Syren was going to be OK. The healer put her hand around Elle’s shoulder and embraced her gently. It was a warm gesture, and one that made Elle instantly love the young lady who had saved her friend.‘Come, little one, we have much to discuss.’ She said.‘You’re a mage?’ Elle blurted out excitedly. Brielle was awed by the display of power she had seen and felt a bond with this mage. She had felt so alone before, shouldering the responsibility of magic that no one understood, now she had a mage as an ally. Someone who could teach her and understand her.‘I am.’ The woman replied kindly. Elle, Ayda, Niall and Sir Rakel were following her back up the stone steps, towards the warm living room above. Elle had so many questions, she couldn’t wait to reach their destination.‘Can you teach me?’‘Partly…’‘Can I heal like you?’‘Maybe…’‘Are we alone?’The questions poured from her like water from a tankard. The healer barely had time to answer before she was hit by the next onslaught of questions. Finally, they reached the living room where the Old Scholar was waiting, comfortable back in his arm chair. He gestured for them to sit around him as the Healer slid the slate hearth back into place.‘I see you have met my friend Nhima,’ He smiled. Elle was fascinated by them both, how the Scholar could smile at her, knowing where she was sat when he was blind was beyond her.‘Yes, she’s a Mage, like me.’ Elle explained breathlessly. The Old Scholar chuckled.‘Who are you?’ Ayda asked him bluntly.‘I am Scholar Byran, or just Byran now really…’ He muttered to himself, fidgeting with his robes.‘You’re not a Scholar anymore?’ Sir Rakel asked, confused.‘Oh no, too old my dear boy.’ Byran muttered. Elle saw Nhima’s eyes flicker to Byran’s and guessed something was being left unspoken. Brielle continued.‘Are you the Scholar who taught our Father to use his magic?’ She asked, anticipating the answer she was sure to come.‘I am. The King at the time – your Grandfather – begged me, I accepted.’‘Can you teach me?’‘I promised your Father that I would, but I fear I will be of less use to you.’ Byran sighed.‘You were not blind when you mentored the King.’ Sir Rakel pointed out.‘Who are you?’ Byran asked the Old Knight, his face faltering slightly.‘Sir Rakel, Chief Protector to the King and Head of the Elven Army.’ Sir Rakel responded proudly.‘Yes, yes, I remember you, the King was very fond of you.’ Byran nodded. At this, Ayda shot Rakel an evil glare as he looked guiltily to the floor. Elle knew he was going to regret his actions until the day he died.‘If I am to teach you, there are rules you must follow.’ Byran began, Elle sat up eagerly.‘You are not allowed to use magic, anywhere other than below. The training rooms below were designed for your Father and this is the only place you can use magic.’‘Why?’ Elle asked.‘The Scholars here are not your friends. If they hear, sense or see your magic, there is nothing we can do to stop them. The Legion is strong here and they will hunt you down,’ Nhima replied softly.‘The rules also apply to me, for they are no friend of mine.”‘They want to kill you too?’ Ayda asked her.‘Me, her, any Mage. Their aim is the extinction of Magic.’‘So, we are not alone?’ Elle whispered, excited and scared at the same time.‘No, little one, there are many, many more of us, they just don’t know it.’ Nhima smiled sadly.‘What do you mean?’ Elle’s brows were furrowed, confused.‘You have been to the Ritual, Princess, tell us what you saw.’ Byran asked her kindly. Brielle felt the gaze of the other’s lock onto her. She retold her story. She told them all the Elves that had joined her in the room, told them of the blue mark on their wrists, all with differing brightness, told them of the orbs of light she now knew to be magic, and of the crystals on the wall and the similarity with the ones in the basement training rooms. Relaying it all back to her companions, aloud, sparked answers inside her head.‘The other Elves are Mages!’ Elle announced, shocked. Byran nodded.‘Let me explain what I have only guessed at over the years,’ Byran began, ‘I have long suspected that Magic is still as abundant as before. First your Father came to me, then Nhima and now yourself, there are never three discrepancies. I then turned to the Ritual. The Chamber itself was a much-researched development. I have long suspected, following your Father’s descriptions, that this was a way of controlling magic. It was only then, with your description, Princess that I can confirm my suspicions.’‘What – why?’ Elle stammered, perplexed.‘You can see the flow of magic. You see it as a light, and you described seeing the light leaving the Elves around you and travelling together to the centre of the Chamber. I believe the Elders are channelling the magic to themselves.’‘You mean the Elders are stealing magic?’ Ayda asked, trying to keep up. ‘How can they possibly do that?’ Niall asked.‘With these Crystals.’ Byran held one clear crystal and one ebony crystal in his hand.‘What do they do?’ Elle asked, intrigued.‘The clear ones absorb magic. The ebony stones block it. This is my belief.’‘How can we prove it?’ Elle asked.‘We will experiment, when the time is right. Now we have you here, you can watch the magic.’ Nhima smiled.‘Why are they stealing magic?’ Sir Rakel asked.‘Control,’ Ayda cut in, ‘Magic destroyed our lands and destroyed our peoples, they want it eradicated and to be the only ones with power.’‘I believe that is partly the reason.’ Byran nodded.‘How so?’ Ayda shot him a look.‘Magic is all but extinct. No one feels its presence anymore, so why steal it unless you have something to gain? I haven’t figured this part out yet.’ Something didn’t add up to Brielle. There were thousands of Mages in her Kingdom, yet the Elders only wanted her dead? They even left her Father untouched over the years before the uprising.‘Why do they want me dead?’ The question left her lips without permission. She hated how scared she sounded.‘The Elders target anyone who uses their magic or whose magic is a threat.’ Nhima responded simply.‘I’d never used mine, nor am I threat.’ Elle replied.‘And Father used magic, and they never targeted him.’ Ayda added.‘Your Father hid his Magic how I taught him, they knew he had magic, but could never trace him using it. That is why it is essential not to use your magic unless you are in the training rooms. They can trace you here.’‘But why-’‘That’s enough for today, you are all tired and need rest. Tomorrow we will begin your training Princess. Get some sleep.’ The Scholar dismissed, and without another word, he locked himself into his private chambers and left them with Nhima. Elle was annoyed, she had some answers, but nothing definite. The Old Scholar had many ideas and explanations but no proof, and he still had not answered why the Elders want her – a child elf – dead when so many Mages are alive! She allowed herself to be ushered back down the stairs towards the training halls again, lost in her thoughts and confusion, she realised she was being led to a corridor with many doors, Nhima showed her friends to their own room, and then finally came to Elle, opening the door she walked inside. The room was small and brightly lit, sconces lined the walls. This room was also covered head to toe in the black crystals. Elle thought he must have spent a long time creating these training rooms. The room contained a small bed and wooden wardrobe, opening it, she was relieved to see a selection of simple linen clothes, including a nightdress.‘Your sister is in the room opposite you, if you need her,’ Nhima advised, ‘I am next door.’Elle nodded appreciatively as Nhima closed the door quietly behind her. She was exhausted. Flinging herself down on the bed she stifled a yawn. The bed was comfortable, much more comfortable than the bed of leaves Ayda had been creating for her every night. It pained her to remember the last night she spent in her grand bed when Amie would brush out her hair before sleep. How far away those nights were, they didn’t seem real to her anymore, a distant dream perhaps. Her head was whirling with thoughts, plans, ideas and worries, she didn’t think sleep would come to her. She tried to imagine an empty box, peaceful, dark and quiet so she could rest. Like a beacon, however, her thoughts would come smashing back to her through the artificial serenity. She decided her dirty clothes may not be helping. Throwing them to the floor she shimmied into her clean, plain nightdress. It was nothing fancy or decorative like back at the Castle, but it was fresh. The scent and softness alone relaxed her. Lying back under the sheets, she felt herself ease a little, and finally, she slept.",

      "content": "15 -AYDADamn him, Ayda thought, as she rolled over again in her bed. She hated being wrong, but she hated being pointless even more. Looking up at the dark stone ceiling she let out a long sigh. What was she to do now? Sir Rakel had gotten them this far, and Elle was to begin her training. Ayda felt frustrated. Her tiny, little sister was more powerful than her and no longer needed her protection. She was also annoyed with herself. She hadn’t trusted Sir Rakel and now she wasn’t sure, he had led them safely here, and Elle was now going to learn to control her magic, which was in everyone’s interest. Something just didn’t feel right. They were now stuck in the middle of a hornet’s nest, there was no escape, so if there was a long-term plan, that Rakel had cooked up with the Legion, they were ready to be served. She couldn’t lower her guard, that would be expected. Sitting up, she gave up on the notion of sleep. Too much had happened, and the soft comfort of the bed was too much for her aching bones. Redressing, she decided to poke around their new home. Pulling open her door slowly, she crept out. She considered waking Elle up for the adventure, but she’d guessed Elle was resting, besides she quite fancied the silence of being alone. She tiptoed along the stone corridor, trying her best not to wake up any of her friends. Reaching the end, she stopped as she heard hushed voices coming from the connecting room.‘Can you not see how pointless this is?’‘How much longer do we have to stay?’It was Karl and Theo, and she guessed they were talking with Niall. Although their voices were hushed, there was a distinct tone that she had not heard from them for a while.‘We promised we’d help them.’ Niall’s voice replied quietly. Ayda felt a rush of warmth spread through her at his words. For some reason, he had put hers and her sisters needs ahead of Theo and Karl, and they had finally had enough. He seemed adamant that he needed to stay, and despite herself she wanted him to. He had been a nuisance to her at the beginning, he had brought back memories she had preferred locked away. Ayda could not deny, her comfort at him being around. Their great defender. He had defended them as best he could against an enemy he never understood, and he had never faltered. Even when faced with leaving Syren, who had hated them so intensely, he had chosen to be the bigger person. She had never appreciated him before.‘There’s nothing left for us, what more can we do? This isn’t our war.’ Karl urged. They continued their heated conversation in hushed tones for a little while longer, Theo and Karl adamant they wanted to return home to the Hole and their Fiends. Ayda stood awkwardly by the door, until finally she spoke up.‘If you guys want to head home, no-one will hold it against you,’ She said kindly appearing in front of them, ‘you have done so much for us, we cannot ask for anymore.’ The three of them were sat around the old wooden table in the centre of the room. Theo and Karl looked up at her when she spoke, relief across their faces.‘It’s not that we don’t want to stay, Ayda, but you don’t need us anymore and we’ve been gone too long as it is.’ Theo replied warmly.‘I understand, I won’t stop you.’ Ayda nodded. Theo and Karl stood happily, content that they at least have Ayda’s support. Walking towards the corridor she had emerged from, Theo patted her on the shoulder as he passed. Ayda smiled at him, but her eyes stayed on Niall. He hadn’t looked at her once. He was looking down at the table, unmoving. Ayda heard the snap of the door as Theo and Karl returned to their rooms and moved closer to Niall.‘You want us to go?’ Niall whispered quietly, still not looking at her.‘What? No, I mean, it’s what you want isn’t it?’ Ayda replied taken aback. Niall finally looked her in the eye. There was an emotion she had not seen before. It was longing. He was holding something back from her, and his expression was hurt and tired.‘I don’t want to leave you, not again. But I have to.’ Niall started. There was a softness in his eye she hadn’t seen before.‘I understand, where will you go?’ Ayda asked gently.‘All these stories, and lies, I need to find the truth about my own people.’ Niall replied.‘About magic?’‘Yes, I want to know why it’s been concealed from us. I was doubtful and rude to you before. But after seeing Elle with my own eyes, I can only apologise.’‘I understand, the world is deceitful. Everything we both believed in was a lie.’ Ayda said quietly. Niall reached across and touched her hand. They were both silent. Ayda looked at the man in front of her. He still had the eyes of the boy she had known before, they were softer. The journey had changed him. He had been so carefree before, but now, he seemed to bear the weight of the world.‘What will you do?’‘I have learnt a lot about your world, there is something you should know of mine,’ Niall started, ‘It has been rumoured that our King has a Spirit God, an advisor.’‘A Spirit God?’ Ayda repeated.‘Yes, no-one has ever seen him, but it is told he possesses magic. No one has ever believed this as no one believed in magic…’‘But now you do. Is that where you will go, to your King?’ Ayda finished.‘Yes, alone, it seems, I have asked too much of my friends.’ Ayda felt slightly uncomfortable as she realised he was still holding her hand. The warmth from his fingertips rose steadily up her arm. She felt their connection change. He was no longer just a haunted past. He was a future, and someone she would greatly miss.‘You have never moved on, have you?’ Niall asked her. Ayda knew what he meant, and strangely, she felt ready to talk.‘I couldn’t. I made it my life’s work to protect my family. I failed.’‘You haven’t. Elle is here safe because of you.’‘But she doesn’t need me.’‘She needs you more than you realise. She wants to protect you too.’‘When will you go?’‘Soon. It will be a long ride.’ Ayda withdrew her hand from his grasp to yawn. It had been a long journey; the tiredness was now creeping up on her. Taking that as his cue, Niall stood.‘Goodnight Princess,’ He smiled, dropping into a deep mocking bow as normal. This time it made her smile, a smile she couldn’t remove from her face as she watched him walk away. Ayda sidled into the seat he had vacated. It was still warm. He was leaving, she thought. Finally, she had pushed him away, and the irony of that was she did not want him to, she wanted him to stay. She wanted all of them to stay. After all the heartache and suffering, after the blood they had shed next to each other, they felt like family. How she felt and what she said never worked well as a team. Ayda felt numb, everyone she cared about was disappearing, maybe she should be the one to leave, before Elle was next. Anger and regret filled her completely. She hated to admit it, but she would miss him. Ayda would miss Niall.",

      "content": "16 - ELLEAll was silent. No flowing river, no scurrying animals or singing birds could be heard. It was silent. She was the only living thing in the world. She waited for the gentle caress of the morning breeze, or the early sun to warm her face, but nothing came. Breathing in she expected the scent of morning dew to soothe her, but the air was cold and stagnant. Where was she? Slowly, she opened her eyes, her vision was blurry, so she blinked the laziness of sleep from them. The room was dim, and dark. There were no windows, she could not tell if it was morning. The walls twinkled in the dimming light of the candles and for a moment she thought she was sleeping with the stars at night. Then she remembered. She was deep in the Mountain, in the cold, lifeless mountain. Her friends were somewhere nearby, silent in their rest. Her bed was warm and comfortable, she felt safe in its embrace. Elle found she missed the freedom of the forest. She had woken warmer and more comfortable than before, yet looking around, she felt like a prisoner. She felt a smile spread across her lips as she remembered why butterflies had taken residence within her – she was going to learn magic today. Jumping up with bubbling enthusiasm she ripped open the wardrobe and pulled on a clean plain dress. Not pausing, she flew out of the door and tore down the corridor. Hearing voices ahead she slowed. Niall and Ayda. Standing in a doorway they were talking in serious voices, it looked uncomfortable, Elle thought. Niall’s expression was grim, it turned her gut to ice, it was not an expression she had seen on his face before. She tried to back away from view – but too late.‘Elle!’ Ayda greeted her, happy to walk away from Niall towards her sister. Elle pushed down a grin as she saw that her sister had also changed her clothes. She looked misplaced in her fresh linens compared to her Patrol Gear and clearly felt uncomfortable, although she had still managed to fix her blade to her waist.‘I don’t think you need that here, we’re safe.’ Elle stifled a giggle, pointing to Ayda’s sword.‘There’s Scholars and the Legion mere feet away from us, we are not safe.’ Ayda pointed out, pulling Elle into a squeeze.‘Why do you have to do that?’ Niall hissed at her, approaching, his expression still dark. ‘We’re safer here than we have been in a long time. Don’t listen to her Princess.’ Elle shook her head fiercely. Nothing was dampening her spirits, today, finally she was going to learn all about her magic. She was one step closer to her Mother, and that was a feeling that wouldn’t fade. Ayda seemed to glimpse the excitement in her little sister’s face.‘Breakfast first, you can’t go magicking around on an empty stomach.’ She teased, leading her sister on. Niall followed closely behind them.‘How are you feeling?’ Ayda asked her little sister.‘Excited, after I’ve learned magic, we can go home. We can see Mother.’ Elle said happily. In her happiness, Brielle did not notice the way Ayda’s mouth open and closed as Niall nudged her slyly.‘Magic may take some time to learn –’ Ayda began.‘I know, but I’m ready.” Elle dismissed. Elle had not noticed the night before how much of labyrinth the underground rooms were. The space was vast, she had no idea how long the construction must have taken. There were several bedrooms next to hers, presumably the same size as hers, where her friends slept. Following the corridor led to the smaller domed room where she had watched Nhima heal Syren the night before. Finally, the large dome, the training dome, connected them to the stairwell which led to the Scholars’ Chambers. To her surprise, they did not follow the staircase up. Ayda led her to another door, a door that she had not noticed before, she could hear laughter and talking voices. As Ayda opened the door for her, Elle squealed as she took in the sight before her. Her friends were all sat around the table, oddly dressed in their clean linens and all content and comfortable in each other’s presence. At the head of the table was the Scholar, laughing at a story Sir Rakel was telling of his childhood with her Father. Nhima was serving up a small portion of porridge into a stone bowl and beaming at her. Their faces all shone at her. She smiled back at them happily, until one smile caught her by surprise. Furthest from her, between Nhima and the Scholar sat a young woman, weakened and pale, but nonetheless sat, quite proudly. Her red hair had been washed and she too was sporting clean clothes. Syren. Elle sprinted faster than ever before and jumped into her arms, tears threatening to flow from her eyes.‘Careful, little one!’ Nhima exclaimed. Elle pulled away from Syren and turned to the young woman. To everyone’s glee, Elle wrapped her arms around her waist.‘Thank you so much!’ Elle wailed in happiness. Nhima blushed and softly patted the curls on the Princess’s head. Elle sat herself down between Nhima and Syren and glowed. Her heart felt as though it was on fire. She had everything. Her friends had fought for her to get here. She loved them and would do anything for them. To see Syren well, happy and sat with her dearest companions filled her with joy. Sir Rakel had been accepted it seemed, Ayda was being far more pleasant to him now that trust had been restored. Elle’s eyes locked with Ayda’s. A deep sadness was silhouetted in her eyes. Ayda had suffered much to get them here. Her over protective, caring, fierce sister had done everything in her power to keep her safe and had fought the odds to get to her. Brielle knew she had much to worry about and much to fear. The most powerful Mages on earth were hunting her, and their army was mere feet away, but right now, when she saw how much she had to lose and how many people had fought loyally beside her, she could not bring herself to fear, or to hate. When her heart weighed so heavily with adoration. The morning was one of light and laughter, the team were lifted to tremendous heights with their success. When Scholar Byran suggested they begin training, the other’s insisted on joining. Brielle could sense their eagerness and agreed, somewhat nervously. Moments later, they were positioned in the large training hall. The black crystals were gleaming brilliantly across the walls.‘First off, let’s see if my theory works.’ The ex-scholar said. He placed one clear crystal on his palm outstretched, Nhima and Elle closely surrounding it.‘Nhima is going to expel some of her Magic into it, Elle I need you to watch it closely.’ He instructed. Elle nodded. At once, a faint trickle of tiny glowing orbs spread from Nhima’s hand towards the crystal. Watching closely, Elle ascertained that the glow of magic moved through the physical boundary of the crystal and lay deep within, leaving the crystal seemingly glowing on its own. Elle explained what she saw. Next, Byran instructed the same, but this time surrounded the white crystals in rough, ebony stones, like the ones on the walls. Firstly, Nhima attempted to pour her magic into the black stones. The light could not penetrate the shell of the stones and merely rested against them unable to go any further. Then she tried to move the stones, as before the glow surrounded the stones but no matter how she tried, they could not be moved. They were unaffected by her magic.‘What does this mean?’ Elle asked.‘I believed the Ebony Stones blocked magic, and as you can see they are not affected by it either,’ The Scholar explained. ‘What you have just described to me, proves that the flow of magic cannot pass the Ebony Stones, but it can be absorbed into the crystals.’ Elle nodded. ‘What we do not know for sure, is if they block the appearance of magic.’ He scratched his head.‘Why is that important? Can all Mages sense magic?’ Ayda asked.‘Not all, but the ones you want to avoid.’ Nhima smiled.‘Can you see it?’ Elle asked Nhima. Nhima shook her head.‘There is only one Mage who can see magic, and that is yourself. But some Mages can sense it in the air, especially strong magic.’ The Scholar explained.‘If Elle goes to your quarters, do you think she could see it?’ Niall suggested cleverly. The rooms below the Scholars Quarters were imbedded with Ebony Stones, the idea was to conceal the magic within.‘It’s worth a shot.’ Elle nodded, already on her way.‘Wait! Up there you are vulnerable with just a wooden door to protect you – be careful!’ The Scholar raised his hand. Elle nodded. Knowing Ayda would follow, she proceeded up the stone stairs. Ouch! She cursed as her head hit the ceiling. The slate hearth was in place, blocking their exit. Ayda heaved with all her strength but could not shift it, it was too heavy.‘Use your magic,’ A female voice called in her mind. Elle jumped, startling Ayda, who looked at her questioningly. That voice! Elle remembered the voice well for it had haunted her dreams since the Ritual.‘Who are you?’ Elle thought back to the disembodied voice in her mind. No answer. Elle huffed, frustrated at being ignored. Elle focussed on the task at hand, the others were waiting. The hearth was heavy and going to take a lot of effort. Elle pushed her magic outwards as she had learnt before, the light spread from her outstretched hands and formed itself around the section of slate above her. She willed it to move, saw her desire clear in her mind. It would not budge. Maybe more magic, she thought. She threw more magic from within her into the stone. It shook slightly with the impact. Once more she concentrated on moving the stone, finally, slowly it lifted. Shock shook through her as she felt the weight of it strain her bones, shaking with effort, she raised the hearth just high enough for them to scramble out and then dropped it back into place behind them. The sound was louder than she had hoped.‘You were shaking, are you ok?’ Ayda asked, concerned.‘It felt heavy. I wasn’t expecting it to.’ Elle whispered, allowing herself time to recover. Sitting down in the armchairs, they waited. Elle looked for any signs of glowing magic from around her. There were none. No lights whatsoever. She disappeared into all the adjoining rooms but could not see any signs of magic from below. She was satisfied that the Scholars assumptions were correct. The Ebony Stones did block all magic, including its signs. It made her untraceable. Deciding they had examined the outside long enough, they opted to move back to the others and share their findings. Elle poured magic back into the stone to open it, and thankfully, found it easier than before. Exhausted from the effort they returned to their friends.‘So, does this mean you are right?’ Ayda asked once they had advised that Elle could not sense the magic.‘It means the Elders cannot sense Brielle and Nhima’s magic down here, which means they are safe.’ The Scholar explained.‘The Elders can sense magic too?” Elle asked, dumbfounded. Did she share a skill with the Elders? Was this why they wanted her dead?‘The Elders can sense all magic, but not see it as you do.’ Nhima continued calmly, ‘The strongest mages are sensed and marked, receiving “summons” and once in the Chamber, the patterns glow to show the Elders the remaining strength of each Mage before the magic is taken. They can then judge the power left in the Chamber.’‘They use these crystals to drain and store the magic they take from the unknowing Mages, but why they do it, I do not know.’ The Scholar finished. Elle remembered the summons on her hand. The light had glowed dimly on the night of the summons, the same as the other Elves lucky enough to be selected. They had all looked at it as a mark of importance, a mark to wear with pride and honour at being one of the few selected. Elle looked down at her hand in disgust. She remembered during the Ritual the mark lighting up on every Elf in the room, she had been startled and blinded by the brightness of her own in comparison with every other. Her parents had also been surprised, she remembered. The mark on her hand was not a medal of honour, not a mark of respect. It was a tag. A tag that had betrayed her strength to the Elders and had marked her only for death. She despised it. She thought back at the marvel of bright spheres, now knowing that she was witnessing the Ritual, witnessing the Elder’s stealing the Elves magic.‘How did you learn all of this?’ Sir Rakel asked. The Scholar sighed.‘I was studying, in the Temple Library. I came across an old book. It was buried deep in the shelves, it hadn’t been touched for centuries. The pages were crumbling to dust. I took it and carefully rewrote it. What I read shocked me. We Scholars are aware of Magic. We know it exists, albeit rarely. But we never knew it could be stolen.’ The room was deafly quiet as everyone clung onto his words. Elle was holding her breath, staying as silent as possible, waiting for the old Scholar to continue.‘I found a record, a diary entry of a Student Mage from before the Elder’s war. He was shocked to learn that he had the talent. He had tried to teach his friends the skill, but it could not be taught. He believed it was a skill that a Mage had to be born with. I read on, intrigued by the Student’s desire for study. He had learned how to store magic into stones. I never got further than that before the Legion and the other Scholars learned of my studies. The Prime Scholar banished me from the Temple and blinded me as punishment. They burned my works and experiments. I was exiled.’‘Oh my...’ Elle felt pity in her heart, this Old Man had been through so much.‘Do not pity me child, for I would be dead, if they had not underestimated what I had learned. All I had to do was fit the pieces together. The exile gave me the freedom to explore. When the King learned of an exiled Scholar not under the influence of the Elders, he was most keen to get in touch. Your Father and I spoke at length of the Ritual Chamber, and the stones within. Together we found them. But we could never be certain of our theory, until now.’ Elle’s mind was reeling. Her Father and this Scholar had worked together on this Theory? Her Father had known all of this? She felt dizzy, this was too much to take on all at once. Ayda looked as pale as she felt, confused.‘Why did Father not stop this, if he knew?’ Ayda asked quietly.‘He was not strong enough to threaten the Elders, we believed no one was.’‘Am I?’ Elle asked, hoping she wasn’t. The Elders felt so big and so mean, and she so small.‘One day you will be.’ The Scholar nodded knowingly.‘We realised your power at the same time the Elders did, we were too late.’‘How do you mean?’ Elle asked, confused. A female voice greeted through her mind. Elle stumbled, in shock she had not expected it. The same voice from the Ritual. Nhima was smiling at her.‘It was you?!’ Elle burst out, flabbergasted. The other’s looked between them in pure confusion.‘But – how – you don’t sound the same?!’ Elle continued.‘Our voices sound different in our minds because it is projection, we’re not actually speaking.’‘But – how!?’‘I can communicate through minds, as long as there is a clear channel.’ Nhima said.‘But you never reply!?’ Elle remarked.‘That’s because I can communicate – you can’t.’‘HOW?!’ Elle asked loudly, confused.‘It’s a skill of mine, I don’t use it often. It’s not often I get a clear channel.’ Nhima replied.‘A clear channel?’‘When you were in the Ritual Chamber your magic was linked to the stones, creating a kind of path between you and the destination. I sensed it and connected myself to it.’‘But that’s hundreds of miles! How did you sense that?!’‘Usually I can’t, but with the flow of that much magic from every mage in that chamber, you can just feel it if you concentrate enough. I didn’t have much time though before they traced me, or before my magic expired.’‘But why did you choose me?’‘I felt what the Elder’s saw in you the moment I connected with the channel and realised the danger we were both in. I pulled away in time, but you didn’t.’ Nhima ended apologetically.‘What did the Elder’s see?’ Elle asked frantically.‘You. The power you possess. I said before that they only hunt those who use their power or those who could threaten them. The extent of your power is so much greater than you realise.’ Elle felt sick. She stormed from the dome not wanting to hear anymore. Everything she had learned as a child was wrong. The weight of the truth bore down on her. She had been told that the Ritual was the highest honour to any Elf. The chance to speak to our Elders and to be bestowed knowledge was the greatest gift among her people, it was a lie. That was NEVER the intention. They were cattle, for farming. The Ritual had served as nothing but a harvest for the Elders to absorb all the power they could from their own people. Bile filled up in her stomach as anger took over. She had known they were wicked for wanting her dead, but to have killed and stolen and lied to her people for centuries about their own birth right revolted her. Her people didn’t know anything! They were all rich in magic and were blind to it! Lied to over centuries about magic being extinct following the war! The Elders she had once respected, worshipped and admired were suddenly everything she loathed in the world. They were the storms that drowned crops, the germs that caused disease and the fire that burned the forests. They were afraid of her, and she would show them fear. She would destroy the reign of the Elders and restore magic to her people.The knowledge that the history and tradition her people were so proud of, was a poison fed to them over years of ignorance, had ignited something inside her. Her actions were fuelled by hate, her desires energized by vengeance. She had been left alone, in the silence of her room for the remainder of the day. She guessed she was not the only one disturbed by the facts. She had seen the tears and disbelief in Sir Rakel’s usually iron eyes, the anger that burned from Syren and the despair and loss from her sister. Their history, in tatters. Even the humans could not understand this. They had been brought up away from all knowledge of magic, they didn’t even remember its existence. There were so many empty spaces in their understanding. Did humans still have magic unbeknownst to them? Or is it truly extinct in their race? She returned to the Training Dome to following morning alone. She practised on her own. She threw objects around the room with her magic, and accidentally destroyed some of the furniture in a blaze of temper. It was only when Ayda appeared, that she stopped.‘It’s a lot to take in, isn’t it?’ Ayda whispered quietly. Elle nodded in reply. At least Ayda had no magic, she hadn’t been stolen from or treated like a prized calf.‘Do you think Father knew?’ Ayda continued. Elle glared at her. Of course, Father hadn’t known. He would have put a stop to it. He would never have let her go in there to be unknowingly stripped of her magic.‘No.’ She replied harshly. Ayda winced, unused to hearing the malice in her good-hearted sister.‘He knew of magic. He used it, learned to hide it. He must have known something.’ Ayda sighed, more to herself than her sister.‘All those stories,’ Elle whispered sadly, ‘who even knows what’s true anymore.’‘Sir Rakel is heartbroken,’ Ayda replied, ‘He disappeared shortly after you and has barricaded his door. He won’t let me in.’‘Why would he let you in? You’ve been foul to him since you saw him!’ Elle let loose at her sister.‘I didn’t trust him! I was protecting you!’ Ayda replied, hurt and shocked.‘I don’t need you! I’m stronger than you – I’ve saved your life twice!’ Elle spat the venom from her mouth.‘This isn’t you – you’re shocked, and upset, I understand.’ Ayda bowed her head, and walked away, leaving Elle to her fury. No matter what Elle did, she knew Ayda would never turn on her, but the moment she disappeared, Elle stood flailing, drowning in her own guilt. She unleashed her magic once more. A small unlit candelabra flew from one wall to a cupboard at the far side of the dome, where a curse echoed. Niall emerged from his crouched hiding place.‘Niall?!’ Elle shouted, rushing over to see if he was hurt. He rubbed his arm as he stood. Why was he hiding? She thought.‘Sorry – sorry,’ He murmured, not looking her in the eye.‘What? Are you OK?’‘Fine, fine… just erm, dropped something.’ Elle knew this was a lie, she hadn’t seen him come in and both entrances were in view. He had been hiding.‘Why were you hiding?’‘Ah, um... well, you started to do your magic thing, erm, rather aggressively so I tried to stay out of your way.’ Niall replied, nervously.‘But why hide?’‘I was going to move,’ He began, ‘But then Ay – I dropped something.’ She knew what he was about to say even if he hadn’t said it. He hid because Ayda walked in. This was unlike Niall she thought. He was usually so carefree and ferocious, nothing could stand in the way of his confidence, and yet here he was cowering in front of a young girl. What had happened? She thought back to the heated conversation she walked in on yesterday between him and Ayda – had they argued? No, she thought, they were always bickering, and it never bothered him before. Or was it her? Had her power scared him?‘I’m sorry if I scared you.’ She said sadly.‘What? No!’ Niall seemed abashed, ‘I mean, it’s slightly unmanning to have a girl powerful enough to throw you and all that but it’s just... never mind. I’ll be fine.’ He thought better of his admittance, bowing mockingly to her as he had always done, and with a fleeting, secret smile, he retired and left her alone. Elle took a seat at the table near the edge of the room. The weight of centuries of deceit wore heavily on her shoulders. She slumped on to the table with her head in her hands. The group had been so strong and so happy, but the news of deceit had shaken them and shone light upon cracks. She had been so willing to trust everyone, had trusted the Elders and her parents, but the more she understood, the more she knew just how far the lies spread. The Elders had lied for centuries, her parents must have known, Ayda had been keeping secrets from her all her life, and yet Elle had laid her soul bare and loved each of them completely. Her heart was bruised, she was alone. Her old friend’s face wouldn’t appear in her memory anymore, the days of playing in the beautiful garden around her favourite tree were gone. Gone from her past and her future. She shook her head, she could not fall into despair. Yes, all she had believed was a lie. But she knew the truth, she knew she was powerful, and she knew that despite it all – she was not alone. There were thousands of Elves all with magic, in the dark about the power glowing brightly within them. There had to be a way to free them all! A young, dark woman walked through the door slowly. Her face was full of sorrow, not kindly as before. Nhima approached wearily and sat down opposite Elle.‘When I was younger than your age, I found my magic by accident,’ Nhima began, ‘My love was my garden. As a child I spent countless hours with my Grandmother, planting seeds and watering the flowers. One year, a snowstorm obliterated our fields, our crops were destroyed. My garden turned white with snow. I remember sitting in the cold snow alone, crying. We were poor, and we were hungry, there was not much to take pleasure from, my saplings and shrubs had all faded. I thought my eyes had been frozen shut by my tears, I had cried for so long. When I dared to open them, I found myself surrounded by a circle of snowdrops.’ Elle opened her mouth in awe. What a wonder that must have been! Nhima’s eyes shone with the memory, a memory that held such a magnificent hold on her heart.‘What did you do?’ Elle asked in an excited whisper.‘My Grandmother had been watching from a window, she ushered me inside so quickly. My Grandmother was a mage. A weak one, like me. She taught me to use what I have.’‘Weak?’ Elle asked.‘Yes, neither me nor my Grandmother were summoned, we were not strong enough to be of use to the Ritual.’‘What happened once you learned your magic?’‘Death,’ Nhima’s eyes glassed over, she was staring at something on the wall opposite. Perhaps shielding her eyes from the horrors, she had witnessed.‘I’m sor-’ Elle began, looking down.Nhima continued her story, ‘The Elders found out and the Legion came in the night. My Grandmother hid me well, they tortured her for my whereabouts. I had never seen magic used that way before… Grandmother taught me to defend, to grow and to heal. But my skill was not enough to save her. They burned our house down with me inside, they believed me to be dead. They searched for years after and never heard of me again.’ Elle shook her head and wiped the racing tears from her cheeks. Nhima had not looked at her once throughout her story. Her face was set like stone, she had grown into a strong and formidable Elf, Brielle thought, her Grandmother would be proud. Elle jumped slightly as Nhima grabbed her hands and looked her deep in the eye. Nhima’s eyes were dark brown, a sorrow was hidden by a passion so strong, Elle thought she saw flames flicker in their reflection.‘Together we can stop this Princess,’ She said, quietly and assertively, ‘I am sorry to tell you all this so soon, but we have never known the Elder’s so afraid. You must be prepared.’‘Yes,’ Elle felt as strongly as she, no more blood was going to be shed to hide magic, no more families destroyed, ‘Teach me.’Nhima’s story had resuscitated Brielle. She found herself more driven and controlled than ever before. There was no more hope of getting to her Mother. She realised there was a bigger picture. The thought of never seeing her Mother again crushed her heart, but if she could prevent other families from enduring the pain that she and Nhima had gone through, all in the name of magic, she knew her sacrifice would be worth it. That day, they had practised well into the night. Nhima had taught her how to shape her magic. Elle had perfected the art of moving small things with her magic, but now she saw that had been easy. Nhima and Byran had shown her how to visualise and feel exactly what she wanted to achieve and to morph her power into the living embodiment of her dream. It was tough work. They wanted her to start a fire. She had focussed and stared at the collection of wood for so long her eyes hurt but it wasn’t enough. She cast out her magic towards the wood, but it did nothing. The tiny orbs of light dissipated, wasted. Nhima explained she had to see the fire, smell it, hear it, and feel it. Elle could see the tiny flame in her mind, she could see it dancing with the smallest change in breeze, she could see growing, consuming the wood and the oxygen. She could hear it cracking the branches and sizzling the air. But it was not enough! She focussed on the feeling, she imagined the warmth enveloping her after a cold day, felt the sweat on her brow.‘All at once Princess – you can do it!’ Nhima encouraged. The effort was immense. Never had she realised how much concentration it took to do everything at once. It was hard to see, feel, hear and smell something that didn’t exist. Harder still to force her mind to believe it. Then she realised. Her mind was her limit. If her mind did not believe it, how on earth could it ever be! Pushing her magic out, the heat wrapped around her, she soaked up the warmth, willing her every bone to believe in its presence. She kept her eyes closed, she found it easier to visualise with her eyes closed. The crackle of the fire and smell of burning wood reached her senses. Believe it, believe it, she willed herself. Distantly, outside of herself she heard clapping and laughter. Forgetting herself, she opened her eyes to see what the fuss was about. Flames! A fire was roaring ferociously before her. Her friends had joined into witness and were laughing and celebrating her success. She felt a smile spread across her lips. She did it! Elle found herself bouncing up and down with the other’s in excitement. Her eagerness soon ebbed away as Nhima told her she now had to extinguish it. Elle didn’t understand, how could she do that.‘Let me show you.’ Nhima offered. Elle stood transfixed as she watched. Nhima’s power poured from within her. The magic surrounded the fire. Brielle watched as the lights changed form and created a clear veil around the fire. Slowly, the fire dimmed down, gradually receding to embers.‘How did you -?’ Elle asked, she hadn’t understood.‘The easiest way to put out a fire, is to eliminate what it needs most. Usually air.’ Byran explained. It clicked. Nhima had created a veil of power around the fire to smother it and starve it of air. Excitement rose within her. She could do that! Elle practised the same drill throughout the day. Lighting the fire and then extinguishing it. She started off slow, with her eyes closed, and sweat pouring from her as she plunged the deep depths of concentration. Eventually, it became more comfortable, and soon, it took mere seconds for a fire to spring into life and die. By the end of the day she was exhausted and relieved to crawl into her bed. Excitement and pride coursed through her veins; she did not believe she could ever drift off to sleep as each triumphant rekindling sparked into her mind clear as day. Eventually she drifted off, her dreams filled with her family and the magic she longed to perform to save them.",

      "content": "17 – NIALLThe day had come. He was leaving. His body was aching from tossing and turning most of the night, unsure whether he was doing the right thing. He stared up at the ceiling, listening to the thunderous snores from one of the other two beds in the room. Karl was soundly sleeping, excited at the prospect of returning home, at last. The Fiends would be waiting for him, and Martha, and he was looking forward to his home comforts, he could almost taste the ale, and the plentiful food waiting for him at the Bridge Inn. He had every reason to be excited, it had been a long time since he had seen his comrades and he missed the brotherhood. Niall had promised the Elven Princesses his protection, but now he was no longer needed. It had taken longer than he anticipated, and they had been through more trials than he expected, but it had been worth it, for he believed that they were the key to whatever story was unfolding. He shoved off the covers from the bed, giving up on any hope of getting the last bit of shut eye and rose out of bed. It was going to be a long journey home and even though they had been sleeping in warm beds for the last few days, he felt no better rested. Shaking the sleepless frustration from his face, grabbed his now clean clothes and began changing into his travelling gear.‘We leaving?’ Theo asked quietly, from where he was rested in bed. Theo face was etched with excitement, he didn’t get much sleep either it would seem.‘After breakfast. The Scholar has offered up some rations for the journey,’ Niall replied.Theo didn’t need encouraging, he leapt out of bed faster than necessary and began to climb into his gear.‘Oi, Karl, wake up!’ He urged, throwing Karl’s gear on top of him. The large man grunted out of his snoring slumber, dazed he rubbed his eyes. Niall hadn’t noticed the way Karl’s feet hung from the end of the bed; he was too tall.‘It will take us a while to get home.’ Theo continued, pulling on his shirt.‘Yep, no rest for the wicked.’ Niall replied sombrely.‘You sure you want to go?’ Theo stopped, and regarded his friend. Niall had not hidden his emotions well enough. He cursed silently. He hated people guessing his thoughts, he used to be the cocky one who had no cares, why couldn’t he go back to that?‘There’s no reason for us to stay.’‘There is, you know there is.’ Theo replied.‘I want to know the truth,’ Niall snapped back, ‘If what we have learned is true then our people should have magic, if these Elves’ Elders are stopping their magic, then what’s happened to ours? What do you think happens to us, once the Elves have their magic returned?’‘How do you plan on finding out?’ Karl asked sleepily, pushing himself up.‘The Capital.’ Karl groaned audibly. The journey to Oakwood Town was long enough, but the Capital was even further. The City was massive in comparison to any settlement they had seen on their journey, but it was also overcrowded. Most of the humans had moved into the Capital over the years, and there were but a handful of towns and villages surrounding it, Oakwood Town being the furthest away.‘So, we’re not going home?’ Karl grumbled.‘Yes, my friend, we’re going home. Then I go to the Capital, you don’t have to join me.’They dressed and gathered their belongings in silence. Niall fixed his sword to his waist and slid into his jacket as Theo slid his twin blades into to their sheaths. With a final check of the room to make sure they left nothing behind they vacated. Quietly, careful not to wake anyone, they tiptoed up the corridor towards the pantry in the dome. Scholar Byran was waiting for them with a linen package.He held it out to Niall who thanked him.‘It’s not much, I have to be careful not to draw attention, our supplies are monitored.’ He said apologetically.‘I understand, thank you.’ Niall nodded.‘We can hunt on the road, don’t you worry,’ Theo added. They all sat down at the table and ate their porridge in silence. Niall was torn. He felt he had to leave, for his people. He had found a scrap of history and a slice of truth and he needed to find out what happened to magic amongst humans. If he could find a Mage, he could help Elle. She was so young to face the burden alone. The Elders feared her, that was the truth, but why, none of them knew. She could see magic, but how could that help her? He desperately wanted to find someone to share her burden, there had to be another Mage out there, there had to be magic in the Human bloodline somewhere, he had to find it. The Princess was pure and kind, but he wondered how long that would last. Then there was Ayda, he didn’t want to leave. He hated saying goodbye last time, this time was worse. Before, they had been children, the path not yet theirs to choose, now they were free, they found themselves even less in control. Things had changed between them. Their relationship had warmed slowly over the journey, her bias towards Humanity had almost disappeared, and he found himself enjoying her presence. Yet now, he knew, she no longer wanted him here.‘Will you say goodbye for us?’ Niall asked quietly.‘What? We’re not saying goodbye?’ Theo spluttered.‘I think it’s for the best.’ Niall responded, not meeting his eye.‘So, you can’t change your mind you mean?’‘That’s not –’‘You’re running away from her, aren’t you?’ Theo scoffed.‘No-’ Niall blushed. Shit. That’s embarrassing he thought. He hadn’t told them of his feelings for Ayda, he had kept them locked away for years, denying it to himself most of the time. How could he deny them now? When even he had to accept how he felt for her, and how much she hurt him that night?‘You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself,’ Theo continued sharply.‘It’s quite pathetic.’ Karl nodded. Niall was surprised at his contribution. Karl was usually the silent one in awkward conversations.‘Either tell her, or don’t tell her, but stop lying to yourself.’ Theo finished, playing with his porridge.‘I know!’ Niall had had enough. Was this a tag match? Niall shook his head. Since when were his friends so concerned with his love life? It had felt good to hate her, hating her was much easier. He had spent so much time thinking about her and doing everything he could for her, with no appreciation that it had felt good to sever that connection.‘Well if you’re happy to walk away and never see them again then fine. Whatever.’ Theo finished, finishing his porridge. In an awkward silence, they finished their breakfast and headed to the chamber doors. Thanking the old Scholar once more, they moved. Niall hoped the feeling in the trio would change, he didn’t fancy the journey in complete silence. Checking they had what they needed, Theo grumbled something about his knife, and headed back to the room alone. Niall hoped he was quick, he wanted to get away. About ten seconds later, he reappeared, looking slightly aghast. Ayda had followed him, closely tailed by Elle. They both looked hurt, Elle had tears in her eyes. Damn it, Niall thought.‘You were leaving without saying goodbye?’ Elle said. The tone of her voice cut him like ice through the heart, he had hurt her deeply. He bent down to her.‘I thought it would be for the best, Princess,’ He replied, honestly. Elle wrapped her arms around him and squeezed.‘You must miss your home,’ She whispered in his ear.‘I do, but that’s not why I’m leaving,’ Niall replied, ‘you have opened my eyes, and now I need to find the truth of my people,’ Elle pulled away and cocked her head to side curiously, her eyes wide. He meant it, he was going to hunt another Mage, and bring them back to her, to share the burden alone. There had to be magic amongst the humans, there had to be.‘If Elves have magic again, Humans must have too.’ He continued. He hoped this was true. The Elder’s had been stealing the Elves’ Magic, so what had been happening to the humans? Was it gone? Dead to the race, or lost? He had to find out. The Elves were on the verge of dawn, if they managed to defeat the Elders, then Magic would be awakened, and the humans would be vulnerable. There had to be magic in their veins, and if he found it in time, then he could save Ayda and Elle from the battles before them. He wished for that more than anything. He looked Ayda in the eye for the last time, there was deep hurt there, and a secret, her gaze flicked away and then back to him. They held the same sorrow he remembered when they were children, a sorrow that had nearly melted away. He hoped his eyes portrayed his apology because in that moment, he couldn’t find a voice to whisper his pain, as he turned away from them and headed home.",

      "content": "LORELEI‘They have arrived,’‘He was true to his word.’ The cave was cold and draughty, the roaring fire in the centre swayed violently in the gust. An occasional drop of water echoed through the white stone cavern, leaving a glittering trail down the walls in its wake. The cave was lit by several flickering candles in tall stands. The dancing flames were dazzling through cavern by the reflection from pristine golden armour. Elven Knights littered the large cavern, all muttering quietly between themselves, several were positioned watching over the entrance. Two grand, white-stone thrones were resting proudly at the head of the hollow, one throne was occupied by a woman with a stern face and scrawled with worry lines. Her long blonde hair was plaited tightly and was trailing down her chest. There were no jewels and no luxurious cloth on her body, instead she was sat in her own armour, her golden breastplate sporting the royal emblem, with a crown embossed into the detailing. Before her, was a soldier sporting his own golden armour, rested in the precious metal were rubies, seemingly alive with the glittering candlelight.‘Your Majesty, our scouts have returned from the lowlands, more and more of our people are seeking refuge,’ Sir Morcei announced calmly and respectfully.‘Yes, yes, but we are too few to offer valuable assistance, we must wait for the right moment.’ Queen Lorelei sighed.‘The Legion are destroying whole towns in search of the Princess.’ Sir Morcei continued remorsefully. To his surprise, the Queen chuckled.‘From previous reports, I would say one Captain seriously underestimated my Princess,’ She grinned proudly.‘It will not take long for them to search the Temple for her, she cannot hide her magic.’ Sir Morcei pressed respectfully. Queen Lorelei ignored him, she had faith in her daughters, they were all that stood in the way of destruction.‘The Legion control much of my Army, Sir Morcei. I am lucky that Sir Rakel and yourself have won around the few soldiers that we have but we do not have the numbers for an uprising.’ The Queen began,‘I think that was more out of loyalty for your Majesties, than for us Protectors,’ Sir Morcei complimented,‘Nevertheless, we could not hide hundreds of Elves climbing the footholds of this Mountain, and as we are the only line of defence in Myrliar, we need our secrecy,’‘I understand, but the Humans…’ Sir Morcei continued to press. It was a mark of their understanding and respect for one another that the Queen allowed his persistent questioning. In truth, she was much indebted to him for bringing her to the bunker and raising her remaining soldiers to her defence, he had been a lifeline for her. The cave she found herself now residing had been created in secret within the Peal Mountains, a hideaway for the Royal Family in its darkest hours. Queen Lorelei had not known of it, Sir Rakel, as the King’s Chief Protector had located it and ensured the safe arrival of her and her loyal guard. The bunker as she liked to call it, had been designed for a family. Several basic, but private rooms had been carved into the stone, and yet, with a pang of the heart strings, she found herself quite alone. She had believed her family to be dead and had fallen into hopelessness, and yet when word got out that her daughters, Ayda and Elle had escaped she had been reborn. Sir Rakel had offered to guide them, keen to make up for failing to protect her beloved husband, and she had gladly accepted. She would have sent her entire battalion to them, but she knew, that they would serve little purpose and more of a hindrance in a Mages’ War. She had many regrets, many worries that kept her up at night, and left her brooding in the day. There were things she longed for the chance to say to her children, but now was not the time. They had arrived safely with the Scholar, and she had to fight the war alone for now, until they were ready to play their part.‘The Humans are rallying, yes, I had expected as much.’ Lorelei conceded,‘The smallest sign of weakness from Myrliar and they are over us like rodents.’ Sir Morcei said disgusted.‘There has not been war between Elves and Humans in years, mere border disputes and raids, King Devan is the most peaceful King that ever lead the Humans. This was not his decision; someone else’s hand is at play here.’ The Queen replied thoughtfully.‘Then who?’ Sir Morcei asked,‘I believe we are pieces on a board, and soon, the players will be unveiled. But it is not yet time.’‘Calumnia is preparing its humans to attack Myrliar, The Legion are blinded and destructive in their search for Princess Brielle, there is no one to protect what remains of our people who are scattered across the land, and we are vastly outnumbered…’‘Yes, but soon, we will have a Mage…’ The Queen finished, hope singing through her voice.‘The Legion have several Mages…’‘My daughter has the power of her birth right, power that only one Mage has had before her.’‘You will put your daughter on the front line?’‘She is our only chance in the war to come, we have enemies all around us, and without her power we will fall.’‘Then let us hope she masters her magic, but for one so young…’‘She will do it. She must. She is the only one with the power to do so. She just doesn’t know it yet.’END OF BOOK 1.",

      "content": "1 – AYDAPulling her cloak closer around her neck she crept forward through the cold night. Her breath fogged in a miniature cloud around her. Careful not to disturb the silence, steadily, she tiptoed through the forest avoiding fallen leaves and branches. Not far behind, a short figure was mimicking her every step, following her trail to stay silent through the trees. The first figure raised her hand and signalled for a stop before crouching behind the closest tree, slowly and carefully the second figure joined her.‘Can you see that?’ She whispered to her comrade, pointing towards several faint flickeringlights in the distance.‘Yes. Ayda, I really think we should go back,’ Jonas' voice was shaking, from coldnervousness she couldn't tell.‘We've come too far! We're almost there!’ Ayda's childish enthusiasm was clear, she wasmoving forwards. They had travelled through the night, leaving the safety of the Stone Castle to cross the Myr River and venture into the dangerous unknown. The forest thinned as they approached the settlement ahead. Slowly, they moved forward, keeping low to avoid being spotted. Several wooden buildings came into view as they moved closer towards the town. A dirt path led through Oakwood Town, lined with dim, flickering streetlights and small wooden log homes and stores. Ayda smiled, the lighting through the village was so faint, it would be easy for them to sneak in and out without being seen. Their path was clear, a quick study revealed that no guards seemed to be on patrol. Running slightly, they followed the path into the village and stopped in the nearest alleyway between the first row of buildings. Neither of them spoke. Catching their breath, their eyes darted each way, taking in the surroundings, ears straining to pick up the slightest sounds. In the distance, a couple of hissing cats were threatening each other over scraps of food, muffled laughter and singing could be heard coming from a lit wooden building several streets away from their hiding spot.‘Everything here is wood,’ Jonas whispered in her ear. Their own people, the Elves, hadlittle use for wooden buildings. A nearby mountain range meant their own homes in the city were made of white stone, even storehouses and stables were made of stone. Children were never allowed out of the Stone City. Ayda rolled her eyes. Jonas had been her best friend since they were very young children, but he never paid any attention in their lessons, and as they approached their teenage years, he was quickly distancing himself from others their age.‘So, now we're in the village, what did you want to see?’ He grinned, clearly his enthusiasm had kicked in the closer they became, despite his previous warnings.‘The Humans,’ Ayda replied simply, ‘My Mother wants me to start my real lessons soon, so I think it's best I see first-hand what we are up against.’ Jonas nodded, he understood what Ayda meant by real lessons. Ayda was a Princess of Myrliar, and as the eldest, was next in line to the throne. This meant that, in time, she would be responsible for protecting her people from the Humans and their bloody history.‘I can't wait for you to be Queen.’ Jonas said gazing into the distance. Ayda looked at Jonas fondly. She knew the reason Jonas paid little attention in lessons; his mind was on Guard Training. It was his dearest wish to become her Protector, and she would trust no-one else when it came to be offering the position. She shook her head, bringing herself back to the present, they had many years before then and she had to concentrate. It was dangerous wandering into human territory, that much she did know. Elves and Humans had been at war for centuries, but she had only read about it in books, and had never seen Humans with her own eyes. Nearby, a loud crash pierced through the silence as a bin was overturned, followed by the barks of several dogs angry at being woken. Ayda and Jonas retreated a few steps as a man stumbled into the alleyway. Instantly, Jonas stepped between the man and Ayda. Jonas held his breath, not sure what to do. Ayda cursed for letting their guard down. Leaning against the wooden log wall, the man looked at the two with unfocussed eyes before taking a large swig from the flask at his waist.‘Oo' you then?’ He blubbered suspiciously, ‘I've not seen you round ere' before?’He stumbled a few steps closer to them, as he leant on the wall. He smelled strongly of ale, his breathing was heavy, and he looked as though he was struggling to keep himself upright. He continued to stare at them, narrowing his eyes as he took a few more sips of his flask. Then suddenly, his eyes rounded as recognition dawned.‘You only kids! You should be abed! Where’s ya mommy?’ He cooed, hiccoughing between breaths. His eyes closed, and he slid down the wall, landed face first in the dirt and fell asleep snoring. Jonas relaxed, and turned to face Ayda,‘Do you think all humans are like that?’ Ayda giggled nervously, relieved that their cloaks had hidden their identity. Jonas gestured that they should leave the alley, someone was bound to come and check on him after the noise he made. Peering around the building, they checked that their way was clear before moving further into the town. Ayda followed the sound of laughter, she was planning to watch these people from a distance, getting too close would mean certain death. Checking that her hood still concealed her, she quickened her steps. Left, then right, then right again, she counted, making sure she remembered the way out. The streets were mostly empty, many people were asleep she guessed. One or two people clumsily made their way through the dirty streets, paying Ayda and Jonas no attention. Finally, they found the noisy building. Cautiously keeping their distance, Ayda watched through the glass window. A jolly band of men were playing the fiddle and singing, whilst men and women danced, bouncing through the room in glee, swinging each other round and round and laughing when they tripped or fell. Others were standing around leaning on walls or sitting at tables, clapping with the music or roaring at something a friend had said. The atmosphere was alive, Ayda felt a smile creep onto her face. These people were carefree and good natured she thought. How can people this happy be capable of such evil? She glanced at Jonas and was surprised to see his head bobbing along to the music, he too wore a grin on his face as he watched the partygoers enjoy themselves through the window. Staying hidden in the shadows, they watched, immersed for many long minutes, allowing the happiness to warm them on the cold night. Ayda could not understand. Through her lessons she had studied human history, ancient books telling stories of bloodshed, hatred and war, the people in front of her, celebrating life, could not possibly be her enemy. Time crept by secretly, as she watched, fascinated.‘Come on, I think we've seen enough, I'm going to get a royal beating when the King and Queen realise you've been out all night.’ Jonas nudged her after a while. Ayda heard him, but she could not tear herself away from the sight, the dancers had dwindled in numbers and people were tiring. Any minute now people would start to leave the party. Jonas grabbed her hand and pulled her away roughly back down the street, just as the door slammed open releasing laughter and drunken voices into the night. Hastily he led her through the twists and turns of the alleys that he remembered, when suddenly he stopped and roughly threw her down a side alley and pushed her down.‘What the –’ Ayda started, but Jonas smothered the sound with a hand to her mouth. Shaking his head at her, she was alarmed to see the panic in his eyes.‘Guards.\" He mouthed, keeping low behind the cluster of bins he hid them behind. Listening, Ayda heard the crunching of heavy boots on dirt approaching, and the clink of metal on metal, they were armed she guessed. Breathing as quietly as possible, they waited for the sounds to fade away as the Guards moved their patrol on. ‘I'm going to check the way, if you get caught, my life won't be worth living.’ Jonas stated. Ayda began to protest but the serious look in his eye silenced her as he moved away. He blamed her. Why had she let her curiosity get to her? Despite his anger at her decision, poor Jonas had felt the need to follow her here to keep her safe and if it wasn't for him, she would likely be a prisoner already – if not dead. What would she do if he got into trouble? He had begged her not to go, had explained that it was too dangerous, but she had gone on. Guiltily, she started to draw in the dirt with her finger, occupying her guilty thoughts and thinking of an apology ready for the moment he arrived to guide her home. Long minutes passed. The town was eerie, no sound came to her. The music and laughter had died out, as had the clumsy scuffles of humans returning home. Where was he? Ayda was sure she remembered the way, she could meet him at the forest, he hadn't said to wait for her after all, maybe he had meant for her to follow at a distance? She sighed and left the safety of her hiding place. Following the path carefully, she double checked each crossing and each shadow before moving, and eventually reached the forest with no encounters. He was not there. Panic started to rise within her. No. He had not been taken. He was lost, she hoped. She would have heard if he had got into trouble, they hadn't ventured that deep into the town. Ayda waited, scanning the town for any signs of him. There were none. There was no movement at all. No cats screeching, no dogs, no humans. The village was deserted, all that remained was the faint flickering of lights and the crisp, cold air. Ayda cursed, she had to go back - she couldn't leave without him. Ayda ran back to the village, confident of the emptiness she had observed, she sped through alleys and round corners, desperately listening for him.Resisting the urge to call out his name, she stopped. Breathing heavily with panic rising in her chest, she spun around desperately. In the corner of her eye she had glimpsed movement, edging closer, her stomach dropped as she saw three armed men hauling a heavy something down an alley not far from her. Guards she thought. Pressing up against the wall, she followed them, hoping to hear anything that would help her find Jonas. As she got closer, she noticed with sickness, that whatever they were carrying had arms. And legs.‘Jonas!’ She screamed, forgetting her silence, terror clutching at her heart. The guards spun around and dropped the lifeless body on the ground. She stared, willing the boy to move, to breathe, to do something, but he didn't. His eyes were closed, and scarlet blood was trickling down his face.‘Grab her!’ A Guard shouted. She ran, tears streaming from her eyes, blinding her. Feeling her way back through the alleys, her hands became rough and splintered along the wooden walls, hoping beyond hope that Jonas was not dead, just unconscious. She heard him, his pounding footsteps were close, too close. She veered left, losing all sense of direction through her hindered sight and manic thoughts. Ayda gasped as her foot caught and she tripped, falling, falling into the dirt, smashing down hard into the ground, she felt her knife press against her thigh under her cloak.‘Stop running girl-elf,’ The guard was right above her, his snarl was rough had harsh. She had nowhere to go. Pushing herself up off the floor, Ayda spun around to face him. He was much older, and he was large. She could tell he was too strong to outrun and she could never fight him off, but maybe she could buy some time. He reached out and grabbed hold of her wrist. Instinctively she grabbed her hunting knife and sank it deep into his outstretched arm, he screamed out and clutched at his bloody arm as she sprinted further and further away. Running blindly, Ayda realised too late, meant she was now utterly lost. Finding herself at a dead end, she cursed, there was nowhere left to run. The guard was yelling as he drew closer. Any minute now he would find her, trapped and vulnerable.‘Hey! Get down here!’ Someone hissed at her as they poked their head out of a grate in the ground. She looked down and saw a boy, slightly older than her, frantically beckoning at her to follow him down. Without a second thought she squeezed through the small gap in the dirt sodden ground and felt her boots hit shallow water. The boy disappeared momentarily as he replaced the grate as silently as he could. Catching her breath, her eyes adjusted to the darkness that pressed in all around her, she heard the thundering echo of the guards' boots fade away.‘T-Thank you.’ She stammered, breathlessly. Reaching out to find a slimy wall, she pressed her sweaty face against the cool surface as she recovered.‘No problem. My Pa sent me to get you.’ He was watching her closely. Unnerved, she realised her hood was down, she hastily rushed to pull it back over.‘Too late girl-elf. We all know what you are.’ He smiled at her.‘Why did you help me?’ She asked, regaining her breath. The boy shrugged then gestured for her to follow. Ayda glanced up at the grate, she could escape now that the guard was gone, she needed to find Jonas.‘They are watching all exits out of the town, you will not escape unnoticed. But, feel free to leave for all I care.’ He stared at her hard, then started walking. Ayda shook her head knowing he was right, she had no chance of saving Jonas alone. Following him she took in her surroundings, by the looks of it they were in the sewers. Water was lapping at her ankles and soaking through her boots, but she trudged on, tense, wondering where this boy was leading her. The only light they had to guide them was a small candle the boy was holding, he obviously knew his way around well. They walked in silence for what felt like an hour before Ayda worked up the courage to speak to her saviour.‘Where are we going?’ Ayda asked nervously, she did not know how much she could trust this stranger.‘To my Pa.’ He replied. It hit Ayda that this could easily be a trap, yet, if it was, he could have just left her to the guard back at the dead end. No. She had to follow this boy. She had no other choice, he may know where Jonas was, and be able to help him.‘Will you help me get my friend? Do you know where he is?’ She asked desperately. The boy did not reply. He stopped and climbed up a tiny hidden ladder. Ayda noticed a wooden door above him, he pounded on it a couple of times before it creaked open. A rough hand took the boy by the arm and lifted him through the gap. Ayda followed cautiously, her foot slipping on the wet ladder. Light flooded her vision as she was heaved up through the space, steadying her balance, she found herself in a small cold room. The small wooden door in the floor was closed behind her.‘Sit,’ A man's voice filled the room. She sat at the lone table and chair next to the young boy.‘Well done Niall. Nice to see one of em' is in one piece.’ He patted the young boy on the back. Niall grinned, clearly proud of his daring rescue. Niall was a couple of years older than Ayda, but small for his age and thin. His dark eyes and dark hair contrasted with his milky white skin. The older man looked tough, he wore dirty clothes, several sizes larger than necessary and his long messy hair was greying in places. He had strong arms and work hardened hands, a worker, Ayda guessed.‘T-Thank you Sir, for your help,’ Ayda stammered her thanks to the older man.‘I don't know why you're here kid, but you should have known better. We don't want your kind here.’ The man said roughly, sitting opposite her at the table. Ayda nodded and looked down at her hands. There was blood on them she noticed, the guard’s blood, she checked her knife belt and felt the blade safely where it should be. ‘We need to get you out of here, girl.’ The man instructed, gruffly.‘Ayda,’ She looked up at him, ‘My name is Ayda. I'm no girl.’ The man chuckled to himself, patted his son on the back and rose to his feet.‘Right then Ayda. If you are no girl, maybe I should kill you right here and now?’ He said staring her down. ‘I don’t like your lot. But I won’t see harm come to a kid.’ Ayda nodded and looked down at her trembling hands again. She had to get to Jonas, she didn't have time for this. She felt tears in her eyes as she thought of her friend only coming along to protect her, and now she had gotten them both into so much trouble.‘I need to get my friend and then we can go home.’ She said quietly.‘No. You need to leave. Now.’ The man said impatiently, pressing a flagon of water into her hands.‘I can't just leave him here!’ Ayda replied firmly, anger rising at the idea of leaving Jonas.‘Niall will take you safely back to the bridge. You will retrieve your horse, ride home and never return.’ Ayda's frustration was boiling, she was not going to leave Jonas here at the mercy of the humans. She could not leave him.‘Why didn't you help him?’ She demanded impatiently, shaking with growing anger. Niall's father placed his hand to his face and rubbed his temple. He looked at her as his gaze softened slightly. Ayda regretted this last question. This man clearly loved his son and had done what he could to help her purely because she was a child. It was obvious he detested 'her kind' and yet out of respect for the love of a Father he had saved her.‘I sent Niall to help you because he is still small enough to fit through all the tunnel exits. We did not realise that there were two of you until it was too late.’ The man explained.‘Well we can go back to Jonas, now can't we?’ Ayda asked despairingly.‘No,’ Niall said quietly, ‘We can't save him.’ Ayda studied their faces, a feeling of dread swept over her as she realised what they might not be telling her. The lifeless body being dropped and not responding through her cries crowded her minded.‘He's dead, girl, better get used to it.’ The older man said.‘They were carrying his body to the river when you spotted them.’ Niall whispered. Ayda slid off her chair and slumped to the floor. Grief swamped her, dragging her heart into the deep dark ocean of despair. She couldn't breathe. No. He could not be dead, he was not allowed to die, he was supposed to protect her. He could not so easily be removed from her life. She shook her head violently, in denial, as if she could rewind the last day and not start this adventure that had cost her best friend his life. She wept. Guilt racked her body, she was shaking. He was just a boy, not yet thirteen. How could they kill a boy?‘Why?!’ She howled through her sobs.‘You're Elves. You would have met the same fate if they had caught you. Which is why you need to leave.’ The man said gently. Both the boy and the man rose, and quietly left the room, leaving Ayda to grieve alone. She never knew how long she spent crying that night, or when her grief turned to blind anger, but she never noticed when Niall entered alone, placing a soft blanket around her shivering frame.",

She could tell he was too strong to outrun and she could never fight him off, but maybe she could buy some time. He reached out and grabbed hold of her wrist. Instinctively she grabbed her hunting knife and sank it deep into his outstretched arm, he screamed out and clutched at his bloody arm as she sprinted further and further away. Running blindly, Ayda realised too late, meant she was now utterly lost. Finding herself at a dead end, she cursed, there was nowhere left to run. The guard was yelling as he drew closer. Any minute now he would find her, trapped and vulnerable.‘Hey! Get down here!’ Someone hissed at her as they poked their head out of a grate in the ground. She looked down and saw a boy, slightly older than her, frantically beckoning at her to follow him down. Without a second thought she squeezed through the small gap in the dirt sodden ground and felt her boots hit shallow water. The boy disappeared momentarily as he replaced the grate as silently as he could. Catching her breath, her eyes adjusted to the darkness that pressed in all around her, she heard the thundering echo of the guards' boots fade away.‘T-Thank you.’ She stammered, breathlessly. Reaching out to find a slimy wall, she pressed her sweaty face against the cool surface as she recovered.‘No problem. My Pa sent me to get you.’ He was watching her closely. Unnerved, she realised her hood was down, she hastily rushed to pull it back over.‘Too late girl-elf. We all know what you are.’ He smiled at her.‘Why did you help me?’ She asked, regaining her breath. The boy shrugged then gestured for her to follow. Ayda glanced up at the grate, she could escape now that the guard was gone, she needed to find Jonas.‘They are watching all exits out of the town, you will not escape unnoticed. But, feel free to leave for all I care.’ He stared at her hard, then started walking. Ayda shook her head knowing he was right, she had no chance of saving Jonas alone. Following him she took in her surroundings, by the looks of it they were in the sewers. Water was lapping at her ankles and soaking through her boots, but she trudged on, tense, wondering where this boy was leading her. The only light they had to guide them was a small candle the boy was holding, he obviously knew his way around well. They walked in silence for what felt like an hour before Ayda worked up the courage to speak to her saviour.‘Where are we going?’ Ayda asked nervously, she did not know how much she could trust this stranger.‘To my Pa.’ He replied. It hit Ayda that this could easily be a trap, yet, if it was, he could have just left her to the guard back at the dead end. No. She had to follow this boy. She had no other choice, he may know where Jonas was, and be able to help him.‘Will you help me get my friend? Do you know where he is?’ She asked desperately. The boy did not reply. He stopped and climbed up a tiny hidden ladder. Ayda noticed a wooden door above him, he pounded on it a couple of times before it creaked open. A rough hand took the boy by the arm and lifted him through the gap. Ayda followed cautiously, her foot slipping on the wet ladder. Light flooded her vision as she was heaved up through the space, steadying her balance, she found herself in a small cold room. The small wooden door in the floor was closed behind her.‘Sit,’ A man's voice filled the room. She sat at the lone table and chair next to the young boy.‘Well done Niall. Nice to see one of em' is in one piece.’ He patted the young boy on the back. Niall grinned, clearly proud of his daring rescue. Niall was a couple of years older than Ayda, but small for his age and thin. His dark eyes and dark hair contrasted with his milky white skin. The older man looked tough, he wore dirty clothes, several sizes larger than necessary and his long messy hair was greying in places. He had strong arms and work hardened hands, a worker, Ayda guessed.‘T-Thank you Sir, for your help,’ Ayda stammered her thanks to the older man.‘I don't know why you're here kid, but you should have known better. We don't want your kind here.’ The man said roughly, sitting opposite her at the table. Ayda nodded and looked down at her hands. There was blood on them she noticed, the guard’s blood, she checked her knife belt and felt the blade safely where it should be. ‘We need to get you out of here, girl.’ The man instructed, gruffly.‘Ayda,’ She looked up at him, ‘My name is Ayda. I'm no girl.’ The man chuckled to himself, patted his son on the back and rose to his feet.‘Right then Ayda. If you are no girl, maybe I should kill you right here and now?’ He said staring her down. ‘I don’t like your lot. But I won’t see harm come to a kid.’ Ayda nodded and looked down at her trembling hands again. She had to get to Jonas, she didn't have time for this. She felt tears in her eyes as she thought of her friend only coming along to protect her, and now she had gotten them both into so much trouble.‘I need to get my friend and then we can go home.’ She said quietly.‘No. You need to leave. Now.’ The man said impatiently, pressing a flagon of water into her hands.‘I can't just leave him here!’ Ayda replied firmly, anger rising at the idea of leaving Jonas.‘Niall will take you safely back to the bridge. You will retrieve your horse, ride home and never return.’ Ayda's frustration was boiling, she was not going to leave Jonas here at the mercy of the humans. She could not leave him.‘Why didn't you help him?’ She demanded impatiently, shaking with growing anger. Niall's father placed his hand to his face and rubbed his temple. He looked at her as his gaze softened slightly. Ayda regretted this last question. This man clearly loved his son and had done what he could to help her purely because she was a child. It was obvious he detested 'her kind' and yet out of respect for the love of a Father he had saved her.‘I sent Niall to help you because he is still small enough to fit through all the tunnel exits. We did not realise that there were two of you until it was too late.’ The man explained.‘Well we can go back to Jonas, now can't we?’ Ayda asked despairingly.‘No,’ Niall said quietly, ‘We can't save him.’ Ayda studied their faces, a feeling of dread swept over her as she realised what they might not be telling her. The lifeless body being dropped and not responding through her cries crowded her minded.‘He's dead, girl, better get used to it.’ The older man said.‘They were carrying his body to the river when you spotted them.’ Niall whispered. Ayda slid off her chair and slumped to the floor. Grief swamped her, dragging her heart into the deep dark ocean of despair. She couldn't breathe. No. He could not be dead, he was not allowed to die, he was supposed to protect her. He could not so easily be removed from her life. She shook her head violently, in denial, as if she could rewind the last day and not start this adventure that had cost her best friend his life. She wept. Guilt racked her body, she was shaking. He was just a boy, not yet thirteen. How could they kill a boy?‘Why?!’ She howled through her sobs.‘You're Elves. You would have met the same fate if they had caught you. Which is why you need to leave.’ The man said gently. Both the boy and the man rose, and quietly left the room, leaving Ayda to grieve alone. She never knew how long she spent crying that night, or when her grief turned to blind anger, but she never noticed when Niall entered alone, placing a soft blanket around her shivering frame.",

      "content": "2 - NIALLNiall was curious. She was the opposite of everything he had grown up believing. Ayda was passionate and loyal, and more importantly - she hadn't looked at him in disgust. She didn't trust him, that much was clear, but he couldn't say he blamed her after what had happened to the boy elf. He had watched in awe of her bravery as she insisted she would save her friend, he saw the fire that burned in her eyes and saw it extinguished as grief smothered the flame. He felt as though he had witnessed a person's soul fleeing the pain, dealt by the loss of a loved one. How he wished he could have helped, just to bring a smile to her face. Hours had passed, and it was a clear morning. Today he would say goodbye to the mysterious girl elf. Scrubbing his face in murky water he cleared his thoughts, preparing questions he wanted to ask before she left. He was just as curious about her world, as she was in his. His Pa was outside preparing the cart with goods, the plan was to smuggle the girl out as far as the bridge, he knew the guards would be searching the town and the forest by now. No Elf was tolerated in their lands, and they would make sure all were destroyed for threatening the humans with their presence. The thought made Niall shudder, he would not let any harm come to this girl, she had her own Pa to go home to. Striding down to the kitchen, looking forward to the conversation he had planned, he stopped suddenly when he saw the girl at the rickety kitchen table. Ayda didn't look up as he slid into a seat opposite her, she was staring blankly at the stone-cold porridge in front of her, dark circles set in beneath her puffy eyes. Had she not slept? He thought to himself. Her eyes had none of the energy he witnessed last night, they were dark and deep and lost. He sighed, all thoughts of questioning her faded, he felt pity for her, a feeling he didn't realise he could feel for an Elf.‘Didn’t you sleep at all?’ He asked quietly. She didn't respond, her eyes were still fixed. ‘You should get some sleep in the cart, it will be a long ride home.’‘I don't care. I don't want to go home.’ She said so quietly he almost missed it.‘But your Ma and Pa will want you home.’ He said encouragingly, smiling at her.‘Not when they know what I have done.’ She shook her head miserably, tears filling her eyes again. This confused him, what had she done? Then he thought, if he had taken a trip to Myrliar his Pa would flay him. He had thought of it a few times, hearing that Myrliar was a beautiful untouched wilderness, the Elves cherished and respected nature, unlike humans who destroyed it and used it to their own ends.‘It's natural to want to explore,’ Niall said kindly, ‘I would love to see your lands.’ Ayda looked up at him, as if wanting to say something. She shook her head thinking better of it. Something deep and painful was living inside her, smothering her flame and drowning out her voice, he decided. Grief could do that to a person, but was this something more? It clicked.‘You feel guilty.’ He said simply, realising. ‘It’s not your fault.’ Ayda didn’t respond. Watching her intently, Niall studied the features on her face. Her long dirty blonde hair was messy, her bright blue eyes were red and blotchy, her skin was a sickly white and her lips were pink. She was beautiful, he thought. He felt something twist inside him. He wanted to look after her, wanted to see that fire again. The door opened, and his Pa walked in.‘You ready?’ He asked gruffly. When Niall nodded, he gestured for them to follow. He led them to an old cart drawn by a horse that was nearing its retirement. The man patted the elderly horse gently and whispered something soothing in its ear.‘Ole' Mack here will get you to the bridge safely.’ He assured her.‘Pa's been riding Mack since he was young, he hasn't ever let us down.’ Niall smiled, taking Ayda by the hand and leading her to the horse. Tentatively she raised her hand to touch its mane, it was rough and knotted, he needed a good clean. He leant into her, enjoying the attention. Lowering the back of the cart, the man helped Ayda into it and buried her beneath several empty sacks behind empty crates and barrels. She was so small, she was invisible.‘Niall is going to the orchard on the other side of the forest, you will pass the bridge on the way,’ The Old Man explained. Ayda nodded and buried herself deeper under the sacks. Niall bid a quiet farewell to his Pa before the cart rolled suddenly into a slow pace. The dirt road was bumpy and hard, several times they hit a small rock hard enough for them to bounce and land with a jolt. Niall was soon covered in bruises as they made their way slowly and noisily to the forest. After several minutes of riding through dirt and stone, new surroundings pressed in. Trees enveloped them, and twigs and branches snapped as they caught up in the wheels and crispy leaves crunched underneath. Niall closed his eyes and listened to the rolling wheels against the ground, the birds singing with the breeze as he rocked gently to and fro with the cart. He thought he heard a quiet whimper behind him and guessed that the ride was even more uncomfortable for Ayda. Looking ahead he could see Guards in the distance watching them draw near. As he reached them he slowed to a stop.‘Good morning!’ Niall said cheerfully.‘Where’re you going this early?’ The guard asked suspiciously, narrowing his eyes at the boy.‘My Pa sent me to the orchard, for apples for pastry, Sir.’ Niall said indifferently.‘Uh huh. Check the back.\" The guard barked the command. The other guards paced around the cart, they checked underneath and looked in the barrels. They paid no attention to the empty sacks. Good job she's small, Niall thought to himself. Even though he knew she was there, he could hardly make out any shape beneath the sacks.‘Move on boy.’ The guard nodded, allowing Mack to continue. Niall moved Mack into a walk, pushing forwards through the forest. The forest grew dense, Niall started to carefully manoeuvre between trees and around rocks. Careful with his cargo and his cart, their pace slowed. After an hour, they finally reached the outskirts of the forest, the sturdy wooden bridge was ahead, in plain sight. Niall sighed. He didn't want to say goodbye here, he wanted to see her home safe. The bridge formed over the Myr River. The Myr River separated their worlds, the Humans and the Elves, once she crossed it, it would be too dangerous for him to follow. The Elves would kill him. Checking their surroundings, he pulled Mack to a stop. The fields either side of him were clear, and no-one appeared to be following from the forest behind.‘We're here Ayda,’ He said, letting go of the reigns, and jumping down from the cart. Ayda appeared from underneath the sacks, she stepped down from the cart and pulled her brown cloak close around her. She looks so vulnerable he thought. He felt a pang of sorrow as he realised he would never see this girl again. She would probably never remember him.‘Ayda-’ He started. Thundering behind spun him around as Ayda's eyes widened, watching something over his shoulder. Hundreds of horses were galloping to the bridge on the other side of the river, each rider covered head to toe in glistening golden armour. Niall's mouth dropped as he recognised the Royal emblem embossed onto each chest plate.‘Are they -?’ He stammered,‘The Royal Protectors.’ Ayda sighed, her cheeks flushing, ‘Father has sent them to find me.’‘Your Pa must be important to send an Army to get you huh?’ Niall said, impressed. The Golden Army stopped at the entrance to the bridge. Niall noticed the rider at the front of the Army wore a different helmet to the others, grander and more richly dressed. The rider dismounted and stomped over the bridge towards them.‘Princess! You are safe!? Come quickly!’ He demanded in a strong, concerned voice.Princess? Niall stared at Ayda, who was staring at the golden army with dread etched across her face. She could not go back to Jonas, but she could not go home either. She was broken, destroyed by guilt. Niall sympathised with her as he thought of her explaining what had happened to the boy's parents. He took her hand in his.‘It was nice meeting you Princess. Remember, it was not your fault.’ Niall said quietly as he squeezed her small hand. He watched her walk away silently, determined to remember every part of her beautiful face. He had known her for a mere night and felt as though his life had changed forever. He didn't feel like a boy anymore. Climbing back up to Mack, he watched her walk towards the rider, whisper something to the man and then follow him to the Army. He waved at her, hoping she would wave back. She didn't. The Army turned and moved away, away so he could not follow. Look back, he thought desperately, please look back. She didn't. He felt his heart break slowly as he realised she would never remember him the way he would remember her.",

      "content": "3 - ELLEThe tree looked down on her, watching the world from its great heights. Hidden beneath its bark were thousands of memories. Faces and voices from people over the years, who had shared secrets whilst enjoying its shade or admiring the beautiful blossoms on its limbs. How she adored this tree - it was older than the Castle itself! She patted down her skirts and sat cross legged beneath it. Smiling up at the sun she opened her book. Stories of Knights and Kings filled her heart, one day she would find her own hero, and they would be forever happy, just like the Princess in her story. Sir Rakel was a Knight - in her Father's Guard no less! He was as loyal and as good as one can be. He had once brought her sister home to safety many years ago and for that she would always love him as an Uncle. He and her Father had played games together as boys - they could well be brothers she mused. Her hair flowed in the breeze, long and blonde, she often ran it through her fingers, trying her best to curl it, but she could never do it as well as Amie, her maid.‘Elle! Elle!’ Children of the court called as they ran past her, chasing butterflies, she laughed as the boys fell over themselves in their haste to impress her. She smiled peacefully and returned to the pages before her. Elle would read for hours, given the time. She lived for the hours spent in a dream, a dream world where anything was possible. Today however, she had little time to spare.Later she would be taken back to her chambers to change, there was to be a Grand Ball today, and as Princess she was expected to attend. The Rituals were starting again soon, Elves from all over Myrliar were making their way to the Stone City to partake. The Ball was just the beginning. Elle was very excited, her Mother had said that this year, she was to participate in the Rituals. Even Ayda had never done this!‘Elle, are you coming?’ A young girl Elf walked up to Elle with her hand out.‘Where are you going?’ Elle asked, lifting her head up from her fantasy.‘To try on our dresses!’ The girl exclaimed excitedly. Elle jumped up, she so wanted to see the other girls' dresses! They ran through the beautiful expansive gardens and up the white stone staircase into the Castle. The Castle was pure white, carved, smooth stone from nearby mountain ranges had been brought down and transformed into the grandest Castle in Myrliar. Centuries old yet the stone was not weathered or crumbling, it stood strong and tall, impenetrable but for the ivy climbing up the towers reaching for the sun. Climbing higher and higher the little elves ran, giggling, until they reached the Princess' large and grand chambers. In the centre of the room was a large four-poster bed, delicately detailed with white and gold ornate patterns. A large balcony was situated across the room which allowed sunlight to flood the white walls as the gentle breeze caressed the white lace voiles. Ivy had crawled through the balcony over the years and now veined the walls, climbing towards the ceiling. Luxurious tapestries, furniture and ornaments lines the room, and stunning, colourful flowers decorated the chambers. It was a room big enough for dancing, and grand enough for a much-loved Princess.‘Princess, is there anything I can get for you?’ Amie asked, dropping into a low courtesy.‘I want to see my dress please! Can you send for the other girl's dresses too?’ Elle asked politely, flinging herself onto her large, grand, golden plated bed. The other girls followed, bouncing happily on her soft mattress. Amie disappeared and then reappeared moments later carrying a pale pink lace dress, with pearl flowers sewn into the skirts and ruffles at the arms. Amie held it up smiling. Elle felt so happy she swelled with pride. She had been waiting for today ever since she had received her summons.‘Oh Princess, it's so beautiful, you are so lucky!’ The girls exclaimed, giddy with excitement.Elle reached out and gently caressed the soft lace skirt, she was going to look so grown up in her gorgeous gown. The other girls' maids brought other dresses one by one, each different in their own way, but none as detailed as the first gown. Elle didn't notice, she thought that tonight every girl would be a Princess.Later that evening, the Ball in the Grand Hall was in full swing. Elves were dancing together, smiling and laughing, celebrating the coming days in honour of the Elders and the cherished Royal Family. It had been months since everyone was last together, this meeting was mandatory, those invited had an obligation to their King to attend. If they did not, they were rounded up and brought to the Castle. It was the most important Ritual in their culture. The King and Queen were standing in the marble Royal Chamber, splendid and tall in their floor length white silk gowns, trimmed with gold and rubies, their young daughter standing proud between them, grinning down at her dress, her golden curls cascading down her back. They glanced to the guarded main doors, patiently waiting. The door flung open. A young elf strode confidently into the centre of the room her hard eyes fixed on her parents. Her blonde hair was cut short, not reaching her shoulders, her piercing blue eyes were hard, and her jaw was set into a determined line. She wore no gown, instead sporting a black tunic wrapped around her tightly and trousers with thick leather buckled boots.‘Your Majesties.’ She curtsied low.‘Oh, Ayda, where is your gown? This is a Grand Ball hosted by the Crown for the Elders.’ The Queen waved a hand and brought her eldest daughter closer examining her. Elle grabbed her sister around her middle and pulled her into a tight squeeze. Glancing down Ayda struggled to keep the smile from her lips as she regarded her young sister, a glowing beauty in her ballgown.‘Training takes all of my time and the Elders once again have not summoned me anyway.’ Ayda shrugged. The King and Queen regarded their eldest sadly. Ayda had been set on joining the Army since she was young, not long after Sir Rakel had recovered her. She planned to reject all claims to the Throne, leaving the burden to her little sister. Ayda had never explained to them why.‘You are still of Royal blood Ayda, it is expected of you.’ The King said gently.‘I hear that Elle has been summoned to the Ritual.’ Ayda cut in, ignoring her father's words.‘Yes, the Elders have deemed her worthy,’ The Queen nodded proudly, ‘She will accompany us tomorrow.’ Elle grinned up at her sister proudly, she was pleased to have been selected by the Elders for the Ritual, she had hoped for many years that she would be summoned. Many Elves across Myrliar were selected and summoned to the Ritual, but not all. Elle had been lucky, Ayda had not once been chosen, even though she was still widely considered the Royal heir. Ayda did not seem bothered by her lack of invitation, she was very rarely seen at Court, and was most often at the Barracks with the other soldiers, drilling.‘It is time to make our appearance.’ The King said, moving towards the chamber doors, arm in arm with his Queen. On the other side of the door, the music was coming to an end and voices could be heard, the Royal Chamber doors opened, and the Royal Family stepped through as one. At once, the crowd bowed low in respect. Gliding across the room, the King and Queen moved through the crowds, politely acknowledging those gathered and gracefully seating themselves upon the gold and ruby emblazoned Thrones at the head of the Grand Hall, tiered higher to watch over the people of their realm. One Elvish Lord raised a golden goblet into the air in toast to the Monarchs, and all others followed suit. Music sprang to life once more amidst laughter and many gathered again to dance. Elle stared in awe at her mother and father, seated so elegantly on their thrones. To her they were everything, they were fair rulers, and loved by all. Many Elves made their way politely to speak with the rulers and each were offered warm conversation and smiles from her parents, to them their position was one of duty, not of glory. Everyone marvelled at the Queens beauty, her waist length golden hair laced with simple flowers and the King's strength, how he held and expressed himself to all was to be admired. Together they were formidable, charming and intelligent. Their rule had been one of peace. Elle moved through the crowds smiling and chatting as her mother had instructed. Several ladies of the court commented on her beauty and her childish innocence, she could feel her mother watching her every step, not in warning, but as a mother would watch a child. Ayda had already slipped into a corner in heavy discussion with a couple of off-duty Knights. Most were paying her little attention, just how she liked it. Elle found a few of the girls she played with regularly and found herself called on to dance. Everyone moved aside, and her parents applauded politely with the crowd ready for her performance. As the music started, Elle and her friends slowly placed their steps in unison along the stone floor, elegantly floating through the air, Elle felt light as a feather as she tiptoed delicately with her friends. Gracefully, they spiralled around each other, taking delight from their skirts lightly floating with their steps. Faster and faster Elle spun in time to the music, laughing and grinning happily, wishing that the music would never end. She prayed for a tune that would whisk her to the stars, so she could peacefully dance in the sky forever. Finally, after an age of dancing and gossiping the King rose from his throne to address the Ball.‘My dear friends and family, lords and ladies, welcome back to our Stone City.’ He smiled opening his arms wide, ‘It is wonderful to have you all return home for the Ritual. As you are all aware tomorrow the Ritual will begin, and those who are lucky enough to have been summoned will partake. I am very pleased to announce that our daughter, Princess Brielle, will also be attending her very first Ritual.’ Raucous applause stormed through the Grand Hall at the news, Elle felt herself blush as many congratulated her enthusiastically on the summons.‘This is great news your Majesty!’ One of the drunken lords cheered through the applause. The King chuckled jovially at the sight of the happy court.‘I am very proud that the Elders have accepted Princess Brielle,’ The King continued, ‘I am confident that she will grow to become a strong pillar for Myrliar. Now, in her honour, and for the honour of all those with summons, let us eat!’ With the King's words, the doors of the Grand Hall opened as one and hundreds of golden serving plates with a large variety of delicious foods were carried in and placed on large stone tables in the serving room off the Grand Hall, slowly the room filed out as the Elves placed themselves around the tables and began to happily dine on the meals. The Princesses were seated next to the Queen at the Top Table, and the King was deep in conversation with his Chief Protector, Sir Rakel to his right. Ayda pulled a leg off the nearest chicken and started to tear into it. Elle watched giggling at her older sister's lack of decorum as she delicately served herself potatoes and vegetables. The room was alive with murmured conversation and a few outbursts of laughter as people enjoyed their meal. Elle watched her sister, Ayda was busy chewing her way through the food in front of her, devouring glass upon glass of wine. Elle watched her, she was worried about her. Over the last couple of years, her sister had removed herself from the family more and more, and was dedicated to her training. Elle had watched her best many soldiers in the Arena in both weapons and hand-to-hand sparring. Brielle loved her sister more than anything, they had once been close and now they seemed in different worlds.After the feast, the drinking and dancing resumed in the Great Hall, and Elle forgot her worry for her sister as she enjoyed the attentions of her ladies. Elle enjoyed watching her lace dress circle her feet as she spiralled across the dance floor with her friends. As the night wore on, members of the gathering slowly retired to their own chambers, Elle was commanded to retire.‘But Mother –’ Elle began to protest.‘No, Brielle.’ The Queen gestured for her own Protector, Sir Morcei, to take her daughter to her Chambers. A tall burly man in golden armour and a heavy great sword moved steadily forward from his guard position behind her and nodded, Elle kissed her mother on the cheek and walked gracefully from the Hall, sending wishes to Elves as she left. Sir Morcei always close behind.The Princess' Chambers were large and luxurious. The four-poster bed where she was sleeping was adorned with comfortable silk bed sheets and down pillows, the white lace around her bed hung like a shield around her whilst she dreamt. The furniture in her Chambers was grand and lightly decorated with ornate gold and precious gemstones and the lower floors contained large marble baths for her to bathe in with mixtures of scented oils and fragrances. The lace voile at her balcony bristled gently in the breeze, bringing a fresh floral scent from the gardens below her tower. Slowly Elle opened her eyes and blinked away sleep. The Princess smiled as she smelt the fresh air flowing in from her balcony. She wondered at the perseverance of the ivy creeping into her Chambers through the balcony door, having grown all the way up the Castle walls and spreading across her walls and detailed ceiling. Sitting up, the bed silks slid away, and she slowly peeled herself out of bed. Walking across the room she rested her hands across the stone parapet surrounding her balcony. She stared out at the vast expanse of her city. Her home.Beneath, the white Castle of Stone was surrounded by vast beautifully manicured gardens, blossoming with shrubs and roses, with the occasional rabbit scarpering across the grass. Multiple marble water fountains could be seen and heard trickling in symmetrical points across the lush lawns. Beyond the gardens a treacherous wall of white stone surrounded the Castle. The Guard wall was impenetrable, it was designed to be perfectly smooth with no nooks for foot holes so climbing was impossible. No one had climbed to the top of the wall in thousands of years, with or without climbing equipment. Guardhouses were situated along the wall. Beyond that, she knew there was a stone town, thousands of buildings where her people lived and prospered. Little stalls where locals bought and sold materials, crafts and food. Children would be playing with whatever toy was the new craze and gatherings would be held in the Square where Elves worshipped the Elders. Elle believed her City was the most beautiful city in the world. Nature lived side by side with Elves, flowers grew all around the fountains, the shops and the schools and were left to venture further. There were several large Houses in the City where a couple of the Lords lived with their families, and of course there was the barracks where her sister now lived. The barracks were situated at the First Wall. The wall that surrounded the entire City and its people was taller and thicker than the Guard Wall. Soldiers of Myrliar were housed and trained within the wall itself, where the barracks were carved into the stone. Behind her, on the other side of the Castle lived the Pearl Mountains, the white stone that had resided there had built her home, and the Mountains were protected as a result. Guardhouses were positioned across the Mountain protecting the stones from being removed without prior permission. Elle tore her eyes away from the beautiful City and returned to her chambers. Today was the Ritual. Amie knocked gently on Brielle's doors before entering, and carefully washed and dressed the young Princess.‘Are you excited?’ Amie smiled at her as she brushed her long hair.‘A little.’ Elle replied, distractedly.‘Oh, come on, it's all you've talked about since the sign!’ Amie laughed, threading a silk ribbon through the fresh plaits. Elle smiled, Amie was always full of decorum in front of people, but in private, she was on good terms with the Princess, Elle trusted her as much as family. It had been Amie that had spotted the glowing symbol known as the summons on Elle's hand. In truth, Elle was excited about the Ritual, it was a high honour to be summoned. It meant that the Elders considered you worthy to be of the few in their presence. The Elders were worshipped strictly throughout Myrliar. Thousands of years ago the Elders had ended the War that humanity had started over new land. Myrliar had suffered heavy losses, lost countless numbers of people and even more in the famine that followed when the burned fields failed to yield crops year after year. The Ritual provided Elves with a chance to commune with the Gods, if you were lucky enough to be summoned you were one step closer to receiving their blessing. They would not be seen, but they could be heard by those chosen. To hear them was the rarest honour in all Myrliar. It was believed they would come to the aid of Myrliar once more, with advice and knowledge that no-one alive bears. Elle's breath caught in her chest. What if they spoke to her? She was merely a girl. What could she do with such knowledge? Suddenly the weight of the Ritual fell on her. She had been caught up so deep in the honour of being summoned that she hadn't realised the importance of the Ritual. She shook her head, no-one alive had been spoken to. It wasn't likely they would speak to a girl.‘You're ready.’ Amie said lightly, patting the Princess gently. The young maid with shoulder length red hair stood from her seat at the dressing table and tapped on the chamber door.‘The Princess is ready for her escort.’ She said politely to the Protectors on the other side.The doors creaked open and the Protectors stood solidly in their Golden Armour waiting for the Princess. Their helmets masked their faces and their stance was commanding, they rarely spoke a word except for orders and safety advice. Brielle walked with them from the room and down the corridor. The Castle was bright and airy and was alight with excitement. She followed the Protectors down deep into the Castle, the bright white walls were soon replaced with cold dark ones as they buried themselves in the tunnels deep under the Castle. Elle was pleased she had asked her mother questions before today, otherwise she would have wondered why they were leading her deep underground with nothing but a flickering flame to guide them. Slowly a long queue of Elves both adult and a few children could be seen waiting patiently outside several ornate double steel doors, their excited faces illuminated by the flickering wall lights.‘Move aside.’ Her Protector grumbled as the crowd parted to allow the Princess through the narrow corridors to the front. Seeing her parents at the head of the queue she sidled in between them nervously. The Queen looked down at her young daughter and winked discretely. The corridors were full of Elves, all looking at the steel doors expectantly. There were no handles, they must open from the inside, Elle thought. The halls were eerily silent. No whispers, just a pregnant silence that succeeded in making her even more nervous. Even her parents were staring patiently at the steel doors. Elle pressed up closer to her mother, her tiny trembling hands reaching for the Queen's. Suddenly the steel doors creaked and whined as they slowly opened, teasing the onlookers with the gradual pace. Minutes passed until they opened widely enough to let them through. The queue moved forward, the King leading them through. Brielle noticed quickly that there was no-one in the Ritual Chamber. Who had opened the doors?! Gradually the Elves filtered into the large circular chamber. The chamber was pitch black, in the centre was a large glistening pillar of faint light, just enough light to enable the Elves to position themselves in circles around the centre, the higher-ranking ones in the centre ring. Brielle took her position a few steps from her mother in the centre ring closest to the pillar of light, once in the room, no one could touch another, so distance was key, her mother had instructed. Looking up in amazement, Elle traced the light to hundreds of crystals embedded in the ceiling, propelling the beam of faint light directly downwards. Looking around, the chamber was black, she could just make out the white of people's eyes. As the final Elf took up their position, the steel doors closed with a loud resounding clunk. Elle flicked through her memory of her mother's instructions, what did she do now? As one, the Elves in the Ritual Chamber lifted their left hand towards the pillar of light, she followed suit. At once, the symbol on her hand appeared as a bright prominent blue light on her skin, as it had done on the day of summons. Alarmed, she looked around and was relieved to see that every Elf had the same symbol on their outstretched hand. She noted that all were of differing brightness, some hardly shone at all. Looking back at hers, she was forced to quickly shut her eyes. The light emanating from her symbol was painful, it was blinding. No one in the chamber had as bright a light as her. The room was beautiful, hundreds of symbols shone like blue stars on a night canvas. She looked to her side, her mother nodded knowingly, a ghost of surprise etched on her face as she took in the brightness of Brielle's own light. The Queen shut her eyes, as did the others. Brielle closed hers tight. A warming sense of peace took over, her hands stopped trembling. This was it she thought, this is when the Elders could speak to me. Nothing happened. Everything was silent for what felt like hours. Elle felt bitter disappointment rise inside alongside a growing feeling of boredom. Had she really expected the centuries old Elders to speak to her when they hadn't even spoken to her parents? Did she think she was better than them? She shook her head to shrug off the thoughts, then she heard it. A girl's voice. It sounded far away, she couldn't make out the words. She strained her ears trying to hear it again. The voice was so faint, and young.‘Hello?’ Elle thought, trying to connect with distant voice, excitement building.‘Get out.’ The girl whispered back, her weak and ghostly voice crystal clear.‘Who- who are you?’ Elle asked nervously in her mind, unsure if she was sane.‘Get out!’ The girl whispered more urgently, her voice laced with fear. Elle hesitated, trying to keep her eyes closed to keep the connection as her mother had told her, the fear in the girl's voice was overwhelming, she felt her own panic rise. A piercing scream vibrated painfully through her mind. Elle's eyes sprang open in alarm, instantly she was blinded by the brilliance of white light that seared through her. Her heart was racing and her breathing erratic. The cold dark room had changed, the white pillar of light in the centre was strong - not the fickle light it had been before. Beads of white light were flowing through the room feeding the pillar’s light. Elle watched open mouthed as the beads spiralled up the pillar and absorbed into the crystals at the top. She looked down at her small body, thousands of pearls were emerging from her body and soaring towards the centre of the room. Elle's eyes widened in panic as her hands tried to collect the tiny glowing beads and return them to her body, they flew through her easily as if she was air. She looked around hastily, everyone had their eyes closed. She watched as the small, bright orbs left her mother's and father's body and glided to the centre. It was happening to everyone she realised. Her mother and father were at peace, smiling, unconcerned. Scrunching her eyes shut again, trying to calm herself, desperately willing the Ritual to be over, she longed to speak to her mother about the pearls and the girls voice, to make sense of it. Finally, after a long and empty hour, with nothing but her confused thoughts to keep her company, Elle heard the chamber doors abruptly heave open. Opening her eyes, she glanced around cautiously, the pillar of light was dim once more. She frowned, had she imagined it? Others were starting to wake and move silently out of the Chamber. Waiting impatiently, she watched her parents come around, rushed up to their side and followed them out as quickly as she could, not wanting to spend any more time in the chamber. She hoped in her heart she would never go in again; the girl’s scream was a horror she would not forget. Something in her face must have betrayed her worry, as her father looked down at her with a frown. Calling over her protector the King sent her back to her personal Chamber.‘I will speak with you later my dear,’ He whispered gently in her ear before she departed. Elle nodded without a glance to him, eyes distant, wondering. Following her Protector up through the Castle, she barely took in her surroundings. She was confused, she should have kept her eyes closed. The Ritual was meant to be a mental connection between them and the Elders. She had broken her connection the moment she opened her eyes. But the scream, the scream was what truly terrified her. She could not explain the fear that had settled under her skin at the girl’s mental touch. Who was she? Were the Elders in danger? She would speak with her Father later, he would know what to think. Yes, she thought, her father could fix everything. She smiled, how could she be so worried when her Father was her own personal brave and strong Knight? Reaching her room, she waited. Her Father would come, and he would make things right. He always did.Later that day, as the sun began its descent, a gentle knock came at Elle’s bedchamber. Slowly the doors silently opened to reveal Protectors positioned at the entrance and a tall gentle man entered the room. The King’s luxurious emerald cloak swept the marble floor as he walked softly through the room. Brielle was sat at the corner of her bed, watching the sun set with sad eyes. The King sat beside her and placed his hands on hers.‘The Ritual must seem like a burden for one so young,’ He said softly. Elle shook her head slowly, eyes still gazing at the setting sun. ‘It is important that you understand what the Ritual is for,’ He continued, ‘none have ever met the Elders, they are centuries old and although we know their story, of their rise, none of us have their wisdom.’ Brielle listened intently, hoping that her Father’s explanation might help her understand what happened in the Chamber. ‘I believe the Elders have vital knowledge that we can benefit from. The Elders send instruction, advice and knowledge through the Rituals and through the Scholars.’ Her Father continued to explain the Temple of Scholars. The Temple was situated north of Myrliar at the Three Thorn Mountains, it was said to be the beginning of the Myr River, built around a huge waterfall that fed the flow of water. No-one Elle knew had ever been to the Temple, but maps had shown her the rough location. The Scholars were widely regarded as Wardens. Their Temple was full of ancient books and records, it was believed that the Elders communicated with the Prime Scholar, sharing knowledge for safekeeping. It was from the Scholar’s Temple that the past histories and stories from the Elders reached them. Stories of murder, death and disease spreading from the burning evil of humanity, were the reason they were encouraged to eradicate humans from Myrliar for safety, and it had been that way for centuries.‘The wise words of the Elders have kept us safe for many years, no war has come to Myrliar and our people have prospered. Do you understand the importance of this Ritual?’ He said softly, brushing her hair from her face.‘I understand Father, but what if I displease them?’ She looked him in the eye and urged him to feel the deep worry that ate at her.‘What could you do to displease them?’ He laughed, stroking her cheek, ‘You are a beautiful young girl with a great kindness in your heart, no doubt that is why you received summons!’‘I opened my eyes.’ Elle said sadly, tears in her eyes, she knew her Father would be angry at her for disobeying orders. She jumped as he laughed loudly. Shocked, she looked at him and saw his eyes glowing with pride.‘See?!’ He laughed pulling her tightly to him and kissing her softly on her head. “I think we have all opened our eyes momentarily during the Ritual my dear, it’s rather difficult to resist!”Elle could have laughed with relief, so they were not going to be angry with her for breaking the connection. She felt a weight lift from her shoulders they had all seen the pearls too.‘What are the little balls of light?’ She asked him.‘Balls of light?’ He frowned, deep in thought, ‘It’s pitch black in that room! Are you sure your eyes weren’t adjusting?’ Elle looked out to the last remnants of the Sun, her room was nearly lit solely by candles, she watched as tiny lights glittered on the windows - was it just a trick of the light? It must have been, she reasoned, no-one else had seen it. Elle shrugged, and shimmied up to her pillows, helping her, the King pressed the bed covers gently around her.‘Goodnight sweetheart,’ Her Father pressed his lips against her forehead and made towards the door.‘Father wait! The voice …’‘The Elders spoke to you Brielle. Only you. Do not share with anyone what they told you unless they have permitted it. You may not understand what they have said, but in time you will. I have faith in you.’ His voice was soft but stern, he looked at her, understanding. She thought she saw a flicker of sadness in his face as he left the room, his eyes never leaving hers as he closed the door with a snap. In that moment Elle felt alone, she desperately wanted to help the girl she heard, but without her father, she had no idea what it meant. Had the Elders spoke to her? Did they need her help? What could she do – she was just a girl?",

Faces and voices from people over the years, who had shared secrets whilst enjoying its shade or admiring the beautiful blossoms on its limbs. How she adored this tree - it was older than the Castle itself! She patted down her skirts and sat cross legged beneath it. Smiling up at the sun she opened her book. Stories of Knights and Kings filled her heart, one day she would find her own hero, and they would be forever happy, just like the Princess in her story. Sir Rakel was a Knight - in her Father's Guard no less! He was as loyal and as good as one can be. He had once brought her sister home to safety many years ago and for that she would always love him as an Uncle. He and her Father had played games together as boys - they could well be brothers she mused. Her hair flowed in the breeze, long and blonde, she often ran it through her fingers, trying her best to curl it, but she could never do it as well as Amie, her maid.‘Elle! Elle!’ Children of the court called as they ran past her, chasing butterflies, she laughed as the boys fell over themselves in their haste to impress her. She smiled peacefully and returned to the pages before her. Elle would read for hours, given the time. She lived for the hours spent in a dream, a dream world where anything was possible. Today however, she had little time to spare.Later she would be taken back to her chambers to change, there was to be a Grand Ball today, and as Princess she was expected to attend. The Rituals were starting again soon, Elves from all over Myrliar were making their way to the Stone City to partake. The Ball was just the beginning. Elle was very excited, her Mother had said that this year, she was to participate in the Rituals. Even Ayda had never done this!‘Elle, are you coming?’ A young girl Elf walked up to Elle with her hand out.‘Where are you going?’ Elle asked, lifting her head up from her fantasy.‘To try on our dresses!’ The girl exclaimed excitedly. Elle jumped up, she so wanted to see the other girls' dresses! They ran through the beautiful expansive gardens and up the white stone staircase into the Castle. The Castle was pure white, carved, smooth stone from nearby mountain ranges had been brought down and transformed into the grandest Castle in Myrliar. Centuries old yet the stone was not weathered or crumbling, it stood strong and tall, impenetrable but for the ivy climbing up the towers reaching for the sun. Climbing higher and higher the little elves ran, giggling, until they reached the Princess' large and grand chambers. In the centre of the room was a large four-poster bed, delicately detailed with white and gold ornate patterns. A large balcony was situated across the room which allowed sunlight to flood the white walls as the gentle breeze caressed the white lace voiles. Ivy had crawled through the balcony over the years and now veined the walls, climbing towards the ceiling. Luxurious tapestries, furniture and ornaments lines the room, and stunning, colourful flowers decorated the chambers. It was a room big enough for dancing, and grand enough for a much-loved Princess.‘Princess, is there anything I can get for you?’ Amie asked, dropping into a low courtesy.‘I want to see my dress please! Can you send for the other girl's dresses too?’ Elle asked politely, flinging herself onto her large, grand, golden plated bed. The other girls followed, bouncing happily on her soft mattress. Amie disappeared and then reappeared moments later carrying a pale pink lace dress, with pearl flowers sewn into the skirts and ruffles at the arms. Amie held it up smiling. Elle felt so happy she swelled with pride. She had been waiting for today ever since she had received her summons.‘Oh Princess, it's so beautiful, you are so lucky!’ The girls exclaimed, giddy with excitement.Elle reached out and gently caressed the soft lace skirt, she was going to look so grown up in her gorgeous gown. The other girls' maids brought other dresses one by one, each different in their own way, but none as detailed as the first gown. Elle didn't notice, she thought that tonight every girl would be a Princess.Later that evening, the Ball in the Grand Hall was in full swing. Elves were dancing together, smiling and laughing, celebrating the coming days in honour of the Elders and the cherished Royal Family. It had been months since everyone was last together, this meeting was mandatory, those invited had an obligation to their King to attend. If they did not, they were rounded up and brought to the Castle. It was the most important Ritual in their culture. The King and Queen were standing in the marble Royal Chamber, splendid and tall in their floor length white silk gowns, trimmed with gold and rubies, their young daughter standing proud between them, grinning down at her dress, her golden curls cascading down her back. They glanced to the guarded main doors, patiently waiting. The door flung open. A young elf strode confidently into the centre of the room her hard eyes fixed on her parents. Her blonde hair was cut short, not reaching her shoulders, her piercing blue eyes were hard, and her jaw was set into a determined line. She wore no gown, instead sporting a black tunic wrapped around her tightly and trousers with thick leather buckled boots.‘Your Majesties.’ She curtsied low.‘Oh, Ayda, where is your gown? This is a Grand Ball hosted by the Crown for the Elders.’ The Queen waved a hand and brought her eldest daughter closer examining her. Elle grabbed her sister around her middle and pulled her into a tight squeeze. Glancing down Ayda struggled to keep the smile from her lips as she regarded her young sister, a glowing beauty in her ballgown.‘Training takes all of my time and the Elders once again have not summoned me anyway.’ Ayda shrugged. The King and Queen regarded their eldest sadly. Ayda had been set on joining the Army since she was young, not long after Sir Rakel had recovered her. She planned to reject all claims to the Throne, leaving the burden to her little sister. Ayda had never explained to them why.‘You are still of Royal blood Ayda, it is expected of you.’ The King said gently.‘I hear that Elle has been summoned to the Ritual.’ Ayda cut in, ignoring her father's words.‘Yes, the Elders have deemed her worthy,’ The Queen nodded proudly, ‘She will accompany us tomorrow.’ Elle grinned up at her sister proudly, she was pleased to have been selected by the Elders for the Ritual, she had hoped for many years that she would be summoned. Many Elves across Myrliar were selected and summoned to the Ritual, but not all. Elle had been lucky, Ayda had not once been chosen, even though she was still widely considered the Royal heir. Ayda did not seem bothered by her lack of invitation, she was very rarely seen at Court, and was most often at the Barracks with the other soldiers, drilling.‘It is time to make our appearance.’ The King said, moving towards the chamber doors, arm in arm with his Queen. On the other side of the door, the music was coming to an end and voices could be heard, the Royal Chamber doors opened, and the Royal Family stepped through as one. At once, the crowd bowed low in respect. Gliding across the room, the King and Queen moved through the crowds, politely acknowledging those gathered and gracefully seating themselves upon the gold and ruby emblazoned Thrones at the head of the Grand Hall, tiered higher to watch over the people of their realm. One Elvish Lord raised a golden goblet into the air in toast to the Monarchs, and all others followed suit. Music sprang to life once more amidst laughter and many gathered again to dance. Elle stared in awe at her mother and father, seated so elegantly on their thrones. To her they were everything, they were fair rulers, and loved by all. Many Elves made their way politely to speak with the rulers and each were offered warm conversation and smiles from her parents, to them their position was one of duty, not of glory. Everyone marvelled at the Queens beauty, her waist length golden hair laced with simple flowers and the King's strength, how he held and expressed himself to all was to be admired. Together they were formidable, charming and intelligent. Their rule had been one of peace. Elle moved through the crowds smiling and chatting as her mother had instructed. Several ladies of the court commented on her beauty and her childish innocence, she could feel her mother watching her every step, not in warning, but as a mother would watch a child. Ayda had already slipped into a corner in heavy discussion with a couple of off-duty Knights. Most were paying her little attention, just how she liked it. Elle found a few of the girls she played with regularly and found herself called on to dance. Everyone moved aside, and her parents applauded politely with the crowd ready for her performance. As the music started, Elle and her friends slowly placed their steps in unison along the stone floor, elegantly floating through the air, Elle felt light as a feather as she tiptoed delicately with her friends. Gracefully, they spiralled around each other, taking delight from their skirts lightly floating with their steps. Faster and faster Elle spun in time to the music, laughing and grinning happily, wishing that the music would never end. She prayed for a tune that would whisk her to the stars, so she could peacefully dance in the sky forever. Finally, after an age of dancing and gossiping the King rose from his throne to address the Ball.‘My dear friends and family, lords and ladies, welcome back to our Stone City.’ He smiled opening his arms wide, ‘It is wonderful to have you all return home for the Ritual. As you are all aware tomorrow the Ritual will begin, and those who are lucky enough to have been summoned will partake. I am very pleased to announce that our daughter, Princess Brielle, will also be attending her very first Ritual.’ Raucous applause stormed through the Grand Hall at the news, Elle felt herself blush as many congratulated her enthusiastically on the summons.‘This is great news your Majesty!’ One of the drunken lords cheered through the applause. The King chuckled jovially at the sight of the happy court.‘I am very proud that the Elders have accepted Princess Brielle,’ The King continued, ‘I am confident that she will grow to become a strong pillar for Myrliar. Now, in her honour, and for the honour of all those with summons, let us eat!’ With the King's words, the doors of the Grand Hall opened as one and hundreds of golden serving plates with a large variety of delicious foods were carried in and placed on large stone tables in the serving room off the Grand Hall, slowly the room filed out as the Elves placed themselves around the tables and began to happily dine on the meals. The Princesses were seated next to the Queen at the Top Table, and the King was deep in conversation with his Chief Protector, Sir Rakel to his right. Ayda pulled a leg off the nearest chicken and started to tear into it. Elle watched giggling at her older sister's lack of decorum as she delicately served herself potatoes and vegetables. The room was alive with murmured conversation and a few outbursts of laughter as people enjoyed their meal. Elle watched her sister, Ayda was busy chewing her way through the food in front of her, devouring glass upon glass of wine. Elle watched her, she was worried about her. Over the last couple of years, her sister had removed herself from the family more and more, and was dedicated to her training. Elle had watched her best many soldiers in the Arena in both weapons and hand-to-hand sparring. Brielle loved her sister more than anything, they had once been close and now they seemed in different worlds.After the feast, the drinking and dancing resumed in the Great Hall, and Elle forgot her worry for her sister as she enjoyed the attentions of her ladies. Elle enjoyed watching her lace dress circle her feet as she spiralled across the dance floor with her friends. As the night wore on, members of the gathering slowly retired to their own chambers, Elle was commanded to retire.‘But Mother –’ Elle began to protest.‘No, Brielle.’ The Queen gestured for her own Protector, Sir Morcei, to take her daughter to her Chambers. A tall burly man in golden armour and a heavy great sword moved steadily forward from his guard position behind her and nodded, Elle kissed her mother on the cheek and walked gracefully from the Hall, sending wishes to Elves as she left. Sir Morcei always close behind.The Princess' Chambers were large and luxurious. The four-poster bed where she was sleeping was adorned with comfortable silk bed sheets and down pillows, the white lace around her bed hung like a shield around her whilst she dreamt. The furniture in her Chambers was grand and lightly decorated with ornate gold and precious gemstones and the lower floors contained large marble baths for her to bathe in with mixtures of scented oils and fragrances. The lace voile at her balcony bristled gently in the breeze, bringing a fresh floral scent from the gardens below her tower. Slowly Elle opened her eyes and blinked away sleep. The Princess smiled as she smelt the fresh air flowing in from her balcony. She wondered at the perseverance of the ivy creeping into her Chambers through the balcony door, having grown all the way up the Castle walls and spreading across her walls and detailed ceiling. Sitting up, the bed silks slid away, and she slowly peeled herself out of bed. Walking across the room she rested her hands across the stone parapet surrounding her balcony. She stared out at the vast expanse of her city. Her home.Beneath, the white Castle of Stone was surrounded by vast beautifully manicured gardens, blossoming with shrubs and roses, with the occasional rabbit scarpering across the grass. Multiple marble water fountains could be seen and heard trickling in symmetrical points across the lush lawns. Beyond the gardens a treacherous wall of white stone surrounded the Castle. The Guard wall was impenetrable, it was designed to be perfectly smooth with no nooks for foot holes so climbing was impossible. No one had climbed to the top of the wall in thousands of years, with or without climbing equipment. Guardhouses were situated along the wall. Beyond that, she knew there was a stone town, thousands of buildings where her people lived and prospered. Little stalls where locals bought and sold materials, crafts and food. Children would be playing with whatever toy was the new craze and gatherings would be held in the Square where Elves worshipped the Elders. Elle believed her City was the most beautiful city in the world. Nature lived side by side with Elves, flowers grew all around the fountains, the shops and the schools and were left to venture further. There were several large Houses in the City where a couple of the Lords lived with their families, and of course there was the barracks where her sister now lived. The barracks were situated at the First Wall. The wall that surrounded the entire City and its people was taller and thicker than the Guard Wall. Soldiers of Myrliar were housed and trained within the wall itself, where the barracks were carved into the stone. Behind her, on the other side of the Castle lived the Pearl Mountains, the white stone that had resided there had built her home, and the Mountains were protected as a result. Guardhouses were positioned across the Mountain protecting the stones from being removed without prior permission. Elle tore her eyes away from the beautiful City and returned to her chambers. Today was the Ritual. Amie knocked gently on Brielle's doors before entering, and carefully washed and dressed the young Princess.‘Are you excited?’ Amie smiled at her as she brushed her long hair.‘A little.’ Elle replied, distractedly.‘Oh, come on, it's all you've talked about since the sign!’ Amie laughed, threading a silk ribbon through the fresh plaits. Elle smiled, Amie was always full of decorum in front of people, but in private, she was on good terms with the Princess, Elle trusted her as much as family. It had been Amie that had spotted the glowing symbol known as the summons on Elle's hand. In truth, Elle was excited about the Ritual, it was a high honour to be summoned. It meant that the Elders considered you worthy to be of the few in their presence. The Elders were worshipped strictly throughout Myrliar. Thousands of years ago the Elders had ended the War that humanity had started over new land. Myrliar had suffered heavy losses, lost countless numbers of people and even more in the famine that followed when the burned fields failed to yield crops year after year. The Ritual provided Elves with a chance to commune with the Gods, if you were lucky enough to be summoned you were one step closer to receiving their blessing. They would not be seen, but they could be heard by those chosen. To hear them was the rarest honour in all Myrliar. It was believed they would come to the aid of Myrliar once more, with advice and knowledge that no-one alive bears. Elle's breath caught in her chest. What if they spoke to her? She was merely a girl. What could she do with such knowledge? Suddenly the weight of the Ritual fell on her. She had been caught up so deep in the honour of being summoned that she hadn't realised the importance of the Ritual. She shook her head, no-one alive had been spoken to. It wasn't likely they would speak to a girl.‘You're ready.’ Amie said lightly, patting the Princess gently. The young maid with shoulder length red hair stood from her seat at the dressing table and tapped on the chamber door.‘The Princess is ready for her escort.’ She said politely to the Protectors on the other side.The doors creaked open and the Protectors stood solidly in their Golden Armour waiting for the Princess. Their helmets masked their faces and their stance was commanding, they rarely spoke a word except for orders and safety advice. Brielle walked with them from the room and down the corridor. The Castle was bright and airy and was alight with excitement. She followed the Protectors down deep into the Castle, the bright white walls were soon replaced with cold dark ones as they buried themselves in the tunnels deep under the Castle. Elle was pleased she had asked her mother questions before today, otherwise she would have wondered why they were leading her deep underground with nothing but a flickering flame to guide them. Slowly a long queue of Elves both adult and a few children could be seen waiting patiently outside several ornate double steel doors, their excited faces illuminated by the flickering wall lights.‘Move aside.’ Her Protector grumbled as the crowd parted to allow the Princess through the narrow corridors to the front. Seeing her parents at the head of the queue she sidled in between them nervously. The Queen looked down at her young daughter and winked discretely. The corridors were full of Elves, all looking at the steel doors expectantly. There were no handles, they must open from the inside, Elle thought. The halls were eerily silent. No whispers, just a pregnant silence that succeeded in making her even more nervous. Even her parents were staring patiently at the steel doors. Elle pressed up closer to her mother, her tiny trembling hands reaching for the Queen's. Suddenly the steel doors creaked and whined as they slowly opened, teasing the onlookers with the gradual pace. Minutes passed until they opened widely enough to let them through. The queue moved forward, the King leading them through. Brielle noticed quickly that there was no-one in the Ritual Chamber. Who had opened the doors?! Gradually the Elves filtered into the large circular chamber. The chamber was pitch black, in the centre was a large glistening pillar of faint light, just enough light to enable the Elves to position themselves in circles around the centre, the higher-ranking ones in the centre ring. Brielle took her position a few steps from her mother in the centre ring closest to the pillar of light, once in the room, no one could touch another, so distance was key, her mother had instructed. Looking up in amazement, Elle traced the light to hundreds of crystals embedded in the ceiling, propelling the beam of faint light directly downwards. Looking around, the chamber was black, she could just make out the white of people's eyes. As the final Elf took up their position, the steel doors closed with a loud resounding clunk. Elle flicked through her memory of her mother's instructions, what did she do now? As one, the Elves in the Ritual Chamber lifted their left hand towards the pillar of light, she followed suit. At once, the symbol on her hand appeared as a bright prominent blue light on her skin, as it had done on the day of summons. Alarmed, she looked around and was relieved to see that every Elf had the same symbol on their outstretched hand. She noted that all were of differing brightness, some hardly shone at all. Looking back at hers, she was forced to quickly shut her eyes. The light emanating from her symbol was painful, it was blinding. No one in the chamber had as bright a light as her. The room was beautiful, hundreds of symbols shone like blue stars on a night canvas. She looked to her side, her mother nodded knowingly, a ghost of surprise etched on her face as she took in the brightness of Brielle's own light. The Queen shut her eyes, as did the others. Brielle closed hers tight. A warming sense of peace took over, her hands stopped trembling. This was it she thought, this is when the Elders could speak to me. Nothing happened. Everything was silent for what felt like hours. Elle felt bitter disappointment rise inside alongside a growing feeling of boredom. Had she really expected the centuries old Elders to speak to her when they hadn't even spoken to her parents? Did she think she was better than them? She shook her head to shrug off the thoughts, then she heard it. A girl's voice. It sounded far away, she couldn't make out the words. She strained her ears trying to hear it again. The voice was so faint, and young.‘Hello?’ Elle thought, trying to connect with distant voice, excitement building.‘Get out.’ The girl whispered back, her weak and ghostly voice crystal clear.‘Who- who are you?’ Elle asked nervously in her mind, unsure if she was sane.‘Get out!’ The girl whispered more urgently, her voice laced with fear. Elle hesitated, trying to keep her eyes closed to keep the connection as her mother had told her, the fear in the girl's voice was overwhelming, she felt her own panic rise. A piercing scream vibrated painfully through her mind. Elle's eyes sprang open in alarm, instantly she was blinded by the brilliance of white light that seared through her. Her heart was racing and her breathing erratic. The cold dark room had changed, the white pillar of light in the centre was strong - not the fickle light it had been before. Beads of white light were flowing through the room feeding the pillar’s light. Elle watched open mouthed as the beads spiralled up the pillar and absorbed into the crystals at the top. She looked down at her small body, thousands of pearls were emerging from her body and soaring towards the centre of the room. Elle's eyes widened in panic as her hands tried to collect the tiny glowing beads and return them to her body, they flew through her easily as if she was air. She looked around hastily, everyone had their eyes closed. She watched as the small, bright orbs left her mother's and father's body and glided to the centre. It was happening to everyone she realised. Her mother and father were at peace, smiling, unconcerned. Scrunching her eyes shut again, trying to calm herself, desperately willing the Ritual to be over, she longed to speak to her mother about the pearls and the girls voice, to make sense of it. Finally, after a long and empty hour, with nothing but her confused thoughts to keep her company, Elle heard the chamber doors abruptly heave open. Opening her eyes, she glanced around cautiously, the pillar of light was dim once more. She frowned, had she imagined it? Others were starting to wake and move silently out of the Chamber. Waiting impatiently, she watched her parents come around, rushed up to their side and followed them out as quickly as she could, not wanting to spend any more time in the chamber. She hoped in her heart she would never go in again; the girl’s scream was a horror she would not forget. Something in her face must have betrayed her worry, as her father looked down at her with a frown. Calling over her protector the King sent her back to her personal Chamber.‘I will speak with you later my dear,’ He whispered gently in her ear before she departed. Elle nodded without a glance to him, eyes distant, wondering. Following her Protector up through the Castle, she barely took in her surroundings. She was confused, she should have kept her eyes closed. The Ritual was meant to be a mental connection between them and the Elders. She had broken her connection the moment she opened her eyes. But the scream, the scream was what truly terrified her. She could not explain the fear that had settled under her skin at the girl’s mental touch. Who was she? Were the Elders in danger? She would speak with her Father later, he would know what to think. Yes, she thought, her father could fix everything. She smiled, how could she be so worried when her Father was her own personal brave and strong Knight? Reaching her room, she waited. Her Father would come, and he would make things right. He always did.Later that day, as the sun began its descent, a gentle knock came at Elle’s bedchamber. Slowly the doors silently opened to reveal Protectors positioned at the entrance and a tall gentle man entered the room. The King’s luxurious emerald cloak swept the marble floor as he walked softly through the room. Brielle was sat at the corner of her bed, watching the sun set with sad eyes. The King sat beside her and placed his hands on hers.‘The Ritual must seem like a burden for one so young,’ He said softly. Elle shook her head slowly, eyes still gazing at the setting sun. ‘It is important that you understand what the Ritual is for,’ He continued, ‘none have ever met the Elders, they are centuries old and although we know their story, of their rise, none of us have their wisdom.’ Brielle listened intently, hoping that her Father’s explanation might help her understand what happened in the Chamber. ‘I believe the Elders have vital knowledge that we can benefit from. The Elders send instruction, advice and knowledge through the Rituals and through the Scholars.’ Her Father continued to explain the Temple of Scholars. The Temple was situated north of Myrliar at the Three Thorn Mountains, it was said to be the beginning of the Myr River, built around a huge waterfall that fed the flow of water. No-one Elle knew had ever been to the Temple, but maps had shown her the rough location. The Scholars were widely regarded as Wardens. Their Temple was full of ancient books and records, it was believed that the Elders communicated with the Prime Scholar, sharing knowledge for safekeeping. It was from the Scholar’s Temple that the past histories and stories from the Elders reached them. Stories of murder, death and disease spreading from the burning evil of humanity, were the reason they were encouraged to eradicate humans from Myrliar for safety, and it had been that way for centuries.‘The wise words of the Elders have kept us safe for many years, no war has come to Myrliar and our people have prospered. Do you understand the importance of this Ritual?’ He said softly, brushing her hair from her face.‘I understand Father, but what if I displease them?’ She looked him in the eye and urged him to feel the deep worry that ate at her.‘What could you do to displease them?’ He laughed, stroking her cheek, ‘You are a beautiful young girl with a great kindness in your heart, no doubt that is why you received summons!’‘I opened my eyes.’ Elle said sadly, tears in her eyes, she knew her Father would be angry at her for disobeying orders. She jumped as he laughed loudly. Shocked, she looked at him and saw his eyes glowing with pride.‘See?!’ He laughed pulling her tightly to him and kissing her softly on her head. “I think we have all opened our eyes momentarily during the Ritual my dear, it’s rather difficult to resist!”Elle could have laughed with relief, so they were not going to be angry with her for breaking the connection. She felt a weight lift from her shoulders they had all seen the pearls too.‘What are the little balls of light?’ She asked him.‘Balls of light?’ He frowned, deep in thought, ‘It’s pitch black in that room! Are you sure your eyes weren’t adjusting?’ Elle looked out to the last remnants of the Sun, her room was nearly lit solely by candles, she watched as tiny lights glittered on the windows - was it just a trick of the light? It must have been, she reasoned, no-one else had seen it. Elle shrugged, and shimmied up to her pillows, helping her, the King pressed the bed covers gently around her.‘Goodnight sweetheart,’ Her Father pressed his lips against her forehead and made towards the door.‘Father wait! The voice …’‘The Elders spoke to you Brielle. Only you. Do not share with anyone what they told you unless they have permitted it. You may not understand what they have said, but in time you will. I have faith in you.’ His voice was soft but stern, he looked at her, understanding. She thought she saw a flicker of sadness in his face as he left the room, his eyes never leaving hers as he closed the door with a snap. In that moment Elle felt alone, she desperately wanted to help the girl she heard, but without her father, she had no idea what it meant. Had the Elders spoke to her? Did they need her help? What could she do – she was just a girl?",

Faces and voices from people over the years, who had shared secrets whilst enjoying its shade or admiring the beautiful blossoms on its limbs. How she adored this tree - it was older than the Castle itself! She patted down her skirts and sat cross legged beneath it. Smiling up at the sun she opened her book. Stories of Knights and Kings filled her heart, one day she would find her own hero, and they would be forever happy, just like the Princess in her story. Sir Rakel was a Knight - in her Father's Guard no less! He was as loyal and as good as one can be. He had once brought her sister home to safety many years ago and for that she would always love him as an Uncle. He and her Father had played games together as boys - they could well be brothers she mused. Her hair flowed in the breeze, long and blonde, she often ran it through her fingers, trying her best to curl it, but she could never do it as well as Amie, her maid.‘Elle! Elle!’ Children of the court called as they ran past her, chasing butterflies, she laughed as the boys fell over themselves in their haste to impress her. She smiled peacefully and returned to the pages before her. Elle would read for hours, given the time. She lived for the hours spent in a dream, a dream world where anything was possible. Today however, she had little time to spare.Later she would be taken back to her chambers to change, there was to be a Grand Ball today, and as Princess she was expected to attend. The Rituals were starting again soon, Elves from all over Myrliar were making their way to the Stone City to partake. The Ball was just the beginning. Elle was very excited, her Mother had said that this year, she was to participate in the Rituals. Even Ayda had never done this!‘Elle, are you coming?’ A young girl Elf walked up to Elle with her hand out.‘Where are you going?’ Elle asked, lifting her head up from her fantasy.‘To try on our dresses!’ The girl exclaimed excitedly. Elle jumped up, she so wanted to see the other girls' dresses! They ran through the beautiful expansive gardens and up the white stone staircase into the Castle. The Castle was pure white, carved, smooth stone from nearby mountain ranges had been brought down and transformed into the grandest Castle in Myrliar. Centuries old yet the stone was not weathered or crumbling, it stood strong and tall, impenetrable but for the ivy climbing up the towers reaching for the sun. Climbing higher and higher the little elves ran, giggling, until they reached the Princess' large and grand chambers. In the centre of the room was a large four-poster bed, delicately detailed with white and gold ornate patterns. A large balcony was situated across the room which allowed sunlight to flood the white walls as the gentle breeze caressed the white lace voiles. Ivy had crawled through the balcony over the years and now veined the walls, climbing towards the ceiling. Luxurious tapestries, furniture and ornaments lines the room, and stunning, colourful flowers decorated the chambers. It was a room big enough for dancing, and grand enough for a much-loved Princess.‘Princess, is there anything I can get for you?’ Amie asked, dropping into a low courtesy.‘I want to see my dress please! Can you send for the other girl's dresses too?’ Elle asked politely, flinging herself onto her large, grand, golden plated bed. The other girls followed, bouncing happily on her soft mattress. Amie disappeared and then reappeared moments later carrying a pale pink lace dress, with pearl flowers sewn into the skirts and ruffles at the arms. Amie held it up smiling. Elle felt so happy she swelled with pride. She had been waiting for today ever since she had received her summons.‘Oh Princess, it's so beautiful, you are so lucky!’ The girls exclaimed, giddy with excitement.Elle reached out and gently caressed the soft lace skirt, she was going to look so grown up in her gorgeous gown. The other girls' maids brought other dresses one by one, each different in their own way, but none as detailed as the first gown. Elle didn't notice, she thought that tonight every girl would be a Princess.Later that evening, the Ball in the Grand Hall was in full swing. Elves were dancing together, smiling and laughing, celebrating the coming days in honour of the Elders and the cherished Royal Family. It had been months since everyone was last together, this meeting was mandatory, those invited had an obligation to their King to attend. If they did not, they were rounded up and brought to the Castle. It was the most important Ritual in their culture. The King and Queen were standing in the marble Royal Chamber, splendid and tall in their floor length white silk gowns, trimmed with gold and rubies, their young daughter standing proud between them, grinning down at her dress, her golden curls cascading down her back. They glanced to the guarded main doors, patiently waiting. The door flung open. A young elf strode confidently into the centre of the room her hard eyes fixed on her parents. Her blonde hair was cut short, not reaching her shoulders, her piercing blue eyes were hard, and her jaw was set into a determined line. She wore no gown, instead sporting a black tunic wrapped around her tightly and trousers with thick leather buckled boots.‘Your Majesties.’ She curtsied low.‘Oh, Ayda, where is your gown? This is a Grand Ball hosted by the Crown for the Elders.’ The Queen waved a hand and brought her eldest daughter closer examining her. Elle grabbed her sister around her middle and pulled her into a tight squeeze. Glancing down Ayda struggled to keep the smile from her lips as she regarded her young sister, a glowing beauty in her ballgown.‘Training takes all of my time and the Elders once again have not summoned me anyway.’ Ayda shrugged. The King and Queen regarded their eldest sadly. Ayda had been set on joining the Army since she was young, not long after Sir Rakel had recovered her. She planned to reject all claims to the Throne, leaving the burden to her little sister. Ayda had never explained to them why.‘You are still of Royal blood Ayda, it is expected of you.’ The King said gently.‘I hear that Elle has been summoned to the Ritual.’ Ayda cut in, ignoring her father's words.‘Yes, the Elders have deemed her worthy,’ The Queen nodded proudly, ‘She will accompany us tomorrow.’ Elle grinned up at her sister proudly, she was pleased to have been selected by the Elders for the Ritual, she had hoped for many years that she would be summoned. Many Elves across Myrliar were selected and summoned to the Ritual, but not all. Elle had been lucky, Ayda had not once been chosen, even though she was still widely considered the Royal heir. Ayda did not seem bothered by her lack of invitation, she was very rarely seen at Court, and was most often at the Barracks with the other soldiers, drilling.‘It is time to make our appearance.’ The King said, moving towards the chamber doors, arm in arm with his Queen. On the other side of the door, the music was coming to an end and voices could be heard, the Royal Chamber doors opened, and the Royal Family stepped through as one. At once, the crowd bowed low in respect. Gliding across the room, the King and Queen moved through the crowds, politely acknowledging those gathered and gracefully seating themselves upon the gold and ruby emblazoned Thrones at the head of the Grand Hall, tiered higher to watch over the people of their realm. One Elvish Lord raised a golden goblet into the air in toast to the Monarchs, and all others followed suit. Music sprang to life once more amidst laughter and many gathered again to dance. Elle stared in awe at her mother and father, seated so elegantly on their thrones. To her they were everything, they were fair rulers, and loved by all. Many Elves made their way politely to speak with the rulers and each were offered warm conversation and smiles from her parents, to them their position was one of duty, not of glory. Everyone marvelled at the Queens beauty, her waist length golden hair laced with simple flowers and the King's strength, how he held and expressed himself to all was to be admired. Together they were formidable, charming and intelligent. Their rule had been one of peace. Elle moved through the crowds smiling and chatting as her mother had instructed. Several ladies of the court commented on her beauty and her childish innocence, she could feel her mother watching her every step, not in warning, but as a mother would watch a child. Ayda had already slipped into a corner in heavy discussion with a couple of off-duty Knights. Most were paying her little attention, just how she liked it. Elle found a few of the girls she played with regularly and found herself called on to dance. Everyone moved aside, and her parents applauded politely with the crowd ready for her performance. As the music started, Elle and her friends slowly placed their steps in unison along the stone floor, elegantly floating through the air, Elle felt light as a feather as she tiptoed delicately with her friends. Gracefully, they spiralled around each other, taking delight from their skirts lightly floating with their steps. Faster and faster Elle spun in time to the music, laughing and grinning happily, wishing that the music would never end. She prayed for a tune that would whisk her to the stars, so she could peacefully dance in the sky forever. Finally, after an age of dancing and gossiping the King rose from his throne to address the Ball.‘My dear friends and family, lords and ladies, welcome back to our Stone City.’ He smiled opening his arms wide, ‘It is wonderful to have you all return home for the Ritual. As you are all aware tomorrow the Ritual will begin, and those who are lucky enough to have been summoned will partake. I am very pleased to announce that our daughter, Princess Brielle, will also be attending her very first Ritual.’ Raucous applause stormed through the Grand Hall at the news, Elle felt herself blush as many congratulated her enthusiastically on the summons.‘This is great news your Majesty!’ One of the drunken lords cheered through the applause. The King chuckled jovially at the sight of the happy court.‘I am very proud that the Elders have accepted Princess Brielle,’ The King continued, ‘I am confident that she will grow to become a strong pillar for Myrliar. Now, in her honour, and for the honour of all those with summons, let us eat!’ With the King's words, the doors of the Grand Hall opened as one and hundreds of golden serving plates with a large variety of delicious foods were carried in and placed on large stone tables in the serving room off the Grand Hall, slowly the room filed out as the Elves placed themselves around the tables and began to happily dine on the meals. The Princesses were seated next to the Queen at the Top Table, and the King was deep in conversation with his Chief Protector, Sir Rakel to his right. Ayda pulled a leg off the nearest chicken and started to tear into it. Elle watched giggling at her older sister's lack of decorum as she delicately served herself potatoes and vegetables. The room was alive with murmured conversation and a few outbursts of laughter as people enjoyed their meal. Elle watched her sister, Ayda was busy chewing her way through the food in front of her, devouring glass upon glass of wine. Elle watched her, she was worried about her. Over the last couple of years, her sister had removed herself from the family more and more, and was dedicated to her training. Elle had watched her best many soldiers in the Arena in both weapons and hand-to-hand sparring. Brielle loved her sister more than anything, they had once been close and now they seemed in different worlds.After the feast, the drinking and dancing resumed in the Great Hall, and Elle forgot her worry for her sister as she enjoyed the attentions of her ladies. Elle enjoyed watching her lace dress circle her feet as she spiralled across the dance floor with her friends. As the night wore on, members of the gathering slowly retired to their own chambers, Elle was commanded to retire.‘But Mother –’ Elle began to protest.‘No, Brielle.’ The Queen gestured for her own Protector, Sir Morcei, to take her daughter to her Chambers. A tall burly man in golden armour and a heavy great sword moved steadily forward from his guard position behind her and nodded, Elle kissed her mother on the cheek and walked gracefully from the Hall, sending wishes to Elves as she left. Sir Morcei always close behind.The Princess' Chambers were large and luxurious. The four-poster bed where she was sleeping was adorned with comfortable silk bed sheets and down pillows, the white lace around her bed hung like a shield around her whilst she dreamt. The furniture in her Chambers was grand and lightly decorated with ornate gold and precious gemstones and the lower floors contained large marble baths for her to bathe in with mixtures of scented oils and fragrances. The lace voile at her balcony bristled gently in the breeze, bringing a fresh floral scent from the gardens below her tower. Slowly Elle opened her eyes and blinked away sleep. The Princess smiled as she smelt the fresh air flowing in from her balcony. She wondered at the perseverance of the ivy creeping into her Chambers through the balcony door, having grown all the way up the Castle walls and spreading across her walls and detailed ceiling. Sitting up, the bed silks slid away, and she slowly peeled herself out of bed. Walking across the room she rested her hands across the stone parapet surrounding her balcony. She stared out at the vast expanse of her city. Her home.Beneath, the white Castle of Stone was surrounded by vast beautifully manicured gardens, blossoming with shrubs and roses, with the occasional rabbit scarpering across the grass. Multiple marble water fountains could be seen and heard trickling in symmetrical points across the lush lawns. Beyond the gardens a treacherous wall of white stone surrounded the Castle. The Guard wall was impenetrable, it was designed to be perfectly smooth with no nooks for foot holes so climbing was impossible. No one had climbed to the top of the wall in thousands of years, with or without climbing equipment. Guardhouses were situated along the wall. Beyond that, she knew there was a stone town, thousands of buildings where her people lived and prospered. Little stalls where locals bought and sold materials, crafts and food. Children would be playing with whatever toy was the new craze and gatherings would be held in the Square where Elves worshipped the Elders. Elle believed her City was the most beautiful city in the world. Nature lived side by side with Elves, flowers grew all around the fountains, the shops and the schools and were left to venture further. There were several large Houses in the City where a couple of the Lords lived with their families, and of course there was the barracks where her sister now lived. The barracks were situated at the First Wall. The wall that surrounded the entire City and its people was taller and thicker than the Guard Wall. Soldiers of Myrliar were housed and trained within the wall itself, where the barracks were carved into the stone. Behind her, on the other side of the Castle lived the Pearl Mountains, the white stone that had resided there had built her home, and the Mountains were protected as a result. Guardhouses were positioned across the Mountain protecting the stones from being removed without prior permission. Elle tore her eyes away from the beautiful City and returned to her chambers. Today was the Ritual. Amie knocked gently on Brielle's doors before entering, and carefully washed and dressed the young Princess.‘Are you excited?’ Amie smiled at her as she brushed her long hair.‘A little.’ Elle replied, distractedly.‘Oh, come on, it's all you've talked about since the sign!’ Amie laughed, threading a silk ribbon through the fresh plaits. Elle smiled, Amie was always full of decorum in front of people, but in private, she was on good terms with the Princess, Elle trusted her as much as family. It had been Amie that had spotted the glowing symbol known as the summons on Elle's hand. In truth, Elle was excited about the Ritual, it was a high honour to be summoned. It meant that the Elders considered you worthy to be of the few in their presence. The Elders were worshipped strictly throughout Myrliar. Thousands of years ago the Elders had ended the War that humanity had started over new land. Myrliar had suffered heavy losses, lost countless numbers of people and even more in the famine that followed when the burned fields failed to yield crops year after year. The Ritual provided Elves with a chance to commune with the Gods, if you were lucky enough to be summoned you were one step closer to receiving their blessing. They would not be seen, but they could be heard by those chosen. To hear them was the rarest honour in all Myrliar. It was believed they would come to the aid of Myrliar once more, with advice and knowledge that no-one alive bears. Elle's breath caught in her chest. What if they spoke to her? She was merely a girl. What could she do with such knowledge? Suddenly the weight of the Ritual fell on her. She had been caught up so deep in the honour of being summoned that she hadn't realised the importance of the Ritual. She shook her head, no-one alive had been spoken to. It wasn't likely they would speak to a girl.‘You're ready.’ Amie said lightly, patting the Princess gently. The young maid with shoulder length red hair stood from her seat at the dressing table and tapped on the chamber door.‘The Princess is ready for her escort.’ She said politely to the Protectors on the other side.The doors creaked open and the Protectors stood solidly in their Golden Armour waiting for the Princess. Their helmets masked their faces and their stance was commanding, they rarely spoke a word except for orders and safety advice. Brielle walked with them from the room and down the corridor. The Castle was bright and airy and was alight with excitement. She followed the Protectors down deep into the Castle, the bright white walls were soon replaced with cold dark ones as they buried themselves in the tunnels deep under the Castle. Elle was pleased she had asked her mother questions before today, otherwise she would have wondered why they were leading her deep underground with nothing but a flickering flame to guide them. Slowly a long queue of Elves both adult and a few children could be seen waiting patiently outside several ornate double steel doors, their excited faces illuminated by the flickering wall lights.‘Move aside.’ Her Protector grumbled as the crowd parted to allow the Princess through the narrow corridors to the front. Seeing her parents at the head of the queue she sidled in between them nervously. The Queen looked down at her young daughter and winked discretely. The corridors were full of Elves, all looking at the steel doors expectantly. There were no handles, they must open from the inside, Elle thought. The halls were eerily silent. No whispers, just a pregnant silence that succeeded in making her even more nervous. Even her parents were staring patiently at the steel doors. Elle pressed up closer to her mother, her tiny trembling hands reaching for the Queen's. Suddenly the steel doors creaked and whined as they slowly opened, teasing the onlookers with the gradual pace. Minutes passed until they opened widely enough to let them through. The queue moved forward, the King leading them through. Brielle noticed quickly that there was no-one in the Ritual Chamber. Who had opened the doors?! Gradually the Elves filtered into the large circular chamber. The chamber was pitch black, in the centre was a large glistening pillar of faint light, just enough light to enable the Elves to position themselves in circles around the centre, the higher-ranking ones in the centre ring. Brielle took her position a few steps from her mother in the centre ring closest to the pillar of light, once in the room, no one could touch another, so distance was key, her mother had instructed. Looking up in amazement, Elle traced the light to hundreds of crystals embedded in the ceiling, propelling the beam of faint light directly downwards. Looking around, the chamber was black, she could just make out the white of people's eyes. As the final Elf took up their position, the steel doors closed with a loud resounding clunk. Elle flicked through her memory of her mother's instructions, what did she do now? As one, the Elves in the Ritual Chamber lifted their left hand towards the pillar of light, she followed suit. At once, the symbol on her hand appeared as a bright prominent blue light on her skin, as it had done on the day of summons. Alarmed, she looked around and was relieved to see that every Elf had the same symbol on their outstretched hand. She noted that all were of differing brightness, some hardly shone at all. Looking back at hers, she was forced to quickly shut her eyes. The light emanating from her symbol was painful, it was blinding. No one in the chamber had as bright a light as her. The room was beautiful, hundreds of symbols shone like blue stars on a night canvas. She looked to her side, her mother nodded knowingly, a ghost of surprise etched on her face as she took in the brightness of Brielle's own light. The Queen shut her eyes, as did the others. Brielle closed hers tight. A warming sense of peace took over, her hands stopped trembling. This was it she thought, this is when the Elders could speak to me. Nothing happened. Everything was silent for what felt like hours. Elle felt bitter disappointment rise inside alongside a growing feeling of boredom. Had she really expected the centuries old Elders to speak to her when they hadn't even spoken to her parents? Did she think she was better than them? She shook her head to shrug off the thoughts, then she heard it. A girl's voice. It sounded far away, she couldn't make out the words. She strained her ears trying to hear it again. The voice was so faint, and young.‘Hello?’ Elle thought, trying to connect with distant voice, excitement building.‘Get out.’ The girl whispered back, her weak and ghostly voice crystal clear.‘Who- who are you?’ Elle asked nervously in her mind, unsure if she was sane.‘Get out!’ The girl whispered more urgently, her voice laced with fear. Elle hesitated, trying to keep her eyes closed to keep the connection as her mother had told her, the fear in the girl's voice was overwhelming, she felt her own panic rise. A piercing scream vibrated painfully through her mind. Elle's eyes sprang open in alarm, instantly she was blinded by the brilliance of white light that seared through her. Her heart was racing and her breathing erratic. The cold dark room had changed, the white pillar of light in the centre was strong - not the fickle light it had been before. Beads of white light were flowing through the room feeding the pillar’s light. Elle watched open mouthed as the beads spiralled up the pillar and absorbed into the crystals at the top. She looked down at her small body, thousands of pearls were emerging from her body and soaring towards the centre of the room. Elle's eyes widened in panic as her hands tried to collect the tiny glowing beads and return them to her body, they flew through her easily as if she was air. She looked around hastily, everyone had their eyes closed. She watched as the small, bright orbs left her mother's and father's body and glided to the centre. It was happening to everyone she realised. Her mother and father were at peace, smiling, unconcerned. Scrunching her eyes shut again, trying to calm herself, desperately willing the Ritual to be over, she longed to speak to her mother about the pearls and the girls voice, to make sense of it. Finally, after a long and empty hour, with nothing but her confused thoughts to keep her company, Elle heard the chamber doors abruptly heave open. Opening her eyes, she glanced around cautiously, the pillar of light was dim once more. She frowned, had she imagined it? Others were starting to wake and move silently out of the Chamber. Waiting impatiently, she watched her parents come around, rushed up to their side and followed them out as quickly as she could, not wanting to spend any more time in the chamber. She hoped in her heart she would never go in again; the girl’s scream was a horror she would not forget. Something in her face must have betrayed her worry, as her father looked down at her with a frown. Calling over her protector the King sent her back to her personal Chamber.‘I will speak with you later my dear,’ He whispered gently in her ear before she departed. Elle nodded without a glance to him, eyes distant, wondering. Following her Protector up through the Castle, she barely took in her surroundings. She was confused, she should have kept her eyes closed. The Ritual was meant to be a mental connection between them and the Elders. She had broken her connection the moment she opened her eyes. But the scream, the scream was what truly terrified her. She could not explain the fear that had settled under her skin at the girl’s mental touch. Who was she? Were the Elders in danger? She would speak with her Father later, he would know what to think. Yes, she thought, her father could fix everything. She smiled, how could she be so worried when her Father was her own personal brave and strong Knight? Reaching her room, she waited. Her Father would come, and he would make things right. He always did.Later that day, as the sun began its descent, a gentle knock came at Elle’s bedchamber. Slowly the doors silently opened to reveal Protectors positioned at the entrance and a tall gentle man entered the room. The King’s luxurious emerald cloak swept the marble floor as he walked softly through the room. Brielle was sat at the corner of her bed, watching the sun set with sad eyes. The King sat beside her and placed his hands on hers.‘The Ritual must seem like a burden for one so young,’ He said softly. Elle shook her head slowly, eyes still gazing at the setting sun. ‘It is important that you understand what the Ritual is for,’ He continued, ‘none have ever met the Elders, they are centuries old and although we know their story, of their rise, none of us have their wisdom.’ Brielle listened intently, hoping that her Father’s explanation might help her understand what happened in the Chamber. ‘I believe the Elders have vital knowledge that we can benefit from. The Elders send instruction, advice and knowledge through the Rituals and through the Scholars.’ Her Father continued to explain the Temple of Scholars. The Temple was situated north of Myrliar at the Three Thorn Mountains, it was said to be the beginning of the Myr River, built around a huge waterfall that fed the flow of water. No-one Elle knew had ever been to the Temple, but maps had shown her the rough location. The Scholars were widely regarded as Wardens. Their Temple was full of ancient books and records, it was believed that the Elders communicated with the Prime Scholar, sharing knowledge for safekeeping. It was from the Scholar’s Temple that the past histories and stories from the Elders reached them. Stories of murder, death and disease spreading from the burning evil of humanity, were the reason they were encouraged to eradicate humans from Myrliar for safety, and it had been that way for centuries.‘The wise words of the Elders have kept us safe for many years, no war has come to Myrliar and our people have prospered. Do you understand the importance of this Ritual?’ He said softly, brushing her hair from her face.‘I understand Father, but what if I displease them?’ She looked him in the eye and urged him to feel the deep worry that ate at her.‘What could you do to displease them?’ He laughed, stroking her cheek, ‘You are a beautiful young girl with a great kindness in your heart, no doubt that is why you received summons!’‘I opened my eyes.’ Elle said sadly, tears in her eyes, she knew her Father would be angry at her for disobeying orders. She jumped as he laughed loudly. Shocked, she looked at him and saw his eyes glowing with pride.‘See?!’ He laughed pulling her tightly to him and kissing her softly on her head. “I think we have all opened our eyes momentarily during the Ritual my dear, it’s rather difficult to resist!”Elle could have laughed with relief, so they were not going to be angry with her for breaking the connection. She felt a weight lift from her shoulders they had all seen the pearls too.‘What are the little balls of light?’ She asked him.‘Balls of light?’ He frowned, deep in thought, ‘It’s pitch black in that room! Are you sure your eyes weren’t adjusting?’ Elle looked out to the last remnants of the Sun, her room was nearly lit solely by candles, she watched as tiny lights glittered on the windows - was it just a trick of the light? It must have been, she reasoned, no-one else had seen it. Elle shrugged, and shimmied up to her pillows, helping her, the King pressed the bed covers gently around her.‘Goodnight sweetheart,’ Her Father pressed his lips against her forehead and made towards the door.‘Father wait! The voice …’‘The Elders spoke to you Brielle. Only you. Do not share with anyone what they told you unless they have permitted it. You may not understand what they have said, but in time you will. I have faith in you.’ His voice was soft but stern, he looked at her, understanding. She thought she saw a flicker of sadness in his face as he left the room, his eyes never leaving hers as he closed the door with a snap. In that moment Elle felt alone, she desperately wanted to help the girl she heard, but without her father, she had no idea what it meant. Had the Elders spoke to her? Did they need her help? What could she do – she was just a girl?",

      "content": "4 – AYDAAyda was hurt, she was sore and aching all over her body. She had been training in the Barracks with her fellow soldiers today, she enjoyed pushing herself to her limits. Calculating her enemy and out manoeuvring them was her speciality. Today she had been partnered with Syren, a ferocious young red-haired Elf, who had proven deadly with her twin blades. Ayda had been pleasantly challenged as Syren was as strong and as fast in combat as her. They had congratulated each other at the end of the duel when there was no clear winner. Detaching herself from the Arena following the bout, Ayda had instantly hurried through the darkening City back to the Castle of Stone. The City was beautiful. Every building, home and market wall was built from the same white stone as the Castle. Each stone had been brought from the towering Pearl Mountains that stood tall behind the Castle and was knitted together with vines and veins from plants that bloomed through the streets. Market holders had begun to pack away the remains of their wares, fabrics, food and tools were boxed away by their owners, whose faces betrayed their daily sales. Many Elves smiled and waved at her as she hastened through their streets. She felt safe, there was no enemy here, this was her home. There were small elves playing in the streets with friends, she could hear their families calling them in from the approaching night. She was keen to hear about the Ritual, interested in celebrating Elle’s excitement, she could already imagine her sister’s tiny face shining with pride. The drawbridge was down, Ayda hurried across and was allowed entry without question, even with her light armour and sword still about her waist from training. The Castle was splendid against its backdrop. The sun was setting behind the Pearl Mountains, marking a glowing outline around the Castle, glints of light were dotted along the walls, towers and turrets as torches were lit inside the expansive halls and corridors. As night approached, the Castle of Stone was alive with hundreds of elves gossiping and talking about today’s Ritual. Many were busying themselves with work along the corridors and assisting in the needs of guests. Most curtsied or bowed politely as she passed hastily. Spotting Amie heading towards a small, concealed wooden door, she guessed was the servant’s quarters, Ayda made towards her.‘Is my sister in her rooms?’ Ayda asked breathlessly.‘I believe so your Highness.’ Amie curtsied, smiling at her. Ayda thanked her and taking the marble and gold Grand stairway two steps at a time she vaulted up and up, racing to the top of the Ivy Tower where her sister’s bedchambers were.The Castle was richly decorated, abundantly dressed in historical and precious artefacts. Ornate pottery and glassware shined on plinths throughout corridors, and the great white walls were layered with portraits of Elves who had long passed, their haunted eyes stalking the living. Many of the artefacts in the Castle represented the Elders. Stone ornaments of four all-powerful figures were common site along the walls, usually gifted to her family. One wall proudly beheld an extravagant tapestry which seemed to tell the tale of the Elders triumph. Four white-cloaked Elves were rejoicing on the field of battle, their fallen enemies scattered around them. Whoever had created the artwork had never met the Elders for they had no clear faces, the tapestry was deceitful and boasting and Ayda despised it. It showed nothing of the folly of war, no blood and no destruction, just the great triumph it held. Ayda sprinted past the tapestry not wasting a moment’s glance at it, anticipation grew within her as she drew closer to her sister’s bedchambers. Not bothering to knock, passing the stationed Protectors, Ayda burst into her little sister’s chambers.‘Elle! Tell me everything!’ She exclaimed proudly, prancing into the dimly lit room. Elle appeared from the balcony. The setting sun was casting a radiance across their lands, the City below them seemed golden, and the light sparkled from the Garden’s pools. Ayda had to pull herself away from the temptation of the view.‘Ayda?’‘I knew you’d be awake waiting for me,’ Ayda said proudly, placing herself on the edge of the luxurious bed. Her sister sidled over, reading Ayda’s expression and taking her in. Spotting a nasty green bruise on Ayda’s cheek, Elle wailed.‘Who did that to you!?’ She wailed, jumping and gently touching Ayda’s face. Ayda shrugged her off patiently and gestured her into bed. Her face lighting up with pride.‘How was it? Did they speak to you?’ Ayda asked excitedly. No-one ever discussed what happened in Ritual Chamber with someone who wasn’t summoned, but she knew her sister would tell her everything if she bullied her enough.‘Father told me not to say.’ Elle mumbled.‘Oh please! Elle come on – what happened?’ Ayda urged.‘It was just a dark dome chamber, we had to close our eyes.’ Elle whispered, shrugging. Ayda regarded her sister solemnly. This was not the reaction she had expected; her younger sister had been excited about this day since her little hand had lit up with the summons and now she was suddenly too embarrassed to speak.‘You aren’t disappointed that they didn’t speak, are you? You know it’s very rare and it was your first Ritual.’ Ayda reasoned slyly, patting her sister on the arm, ‘Anyway I doubt they’d speak to a little Elf, you’re not old enough!’‘I am! They did!’ Elle exclaimed, a hand shot to her mouth as she realised what she’d said.‘They spoke to you?!’ Ayda said loudly, shocked. It had always been easy to trick her little sister into speaking, but she hadn’t been expecting that. Elle was angry with herself, she pursed her lips together determined not to mention anything further.‘What did they say?’ Ayda urged, still reeling that her little sister had been whispered to by the Elders. Elle shook her head furiously and crossed her arms. Elle was not going to speak to her. A dark shadow crossed Brielle’s face as her gaze wandered to the view from her room. Silence followed, Elle started slowly rocking backwards and forwards, her eyes fixed. Ayda could not take her eyes from her sister, she seemed vulnerable, worried and distant, not at all what she had expected. Sitting patiently, long minutes passed as she waited for her to speak.‘I’m scared.’ Elle whispered finally, staring into the darkness, ‘I wanted to tell Father, but he told me I should keep it to myself.’ Ayda pulled her sister gently into her chest. She loved her sister immensely. Brielle had always been the kindest, softest, sweetest girl. Ayda knew that Elle would have turned desperately to the King, out of a child’s love for her father, but he had unknowingly forced the girl to keep a secret that would burden the child’s gentle nature.‘Tell me as much as you want, I promise if I can help, I will.’ Ayda said kindly. Elle nodded, relieved that someone she loved had listened and heard her plea. But she refused to say any more. Ayda tucked her in, beneath the bed sheets and told her stories she hoped would lighten her spirit, Elle had liked listening to the adventures her sister went on. There was always one adventure that Elle would beg to be told, yet Ayda had never told a soul. That story she would keep within her forever, she could not face speaking it. Somehow, tonight Ayda found her sister was not listening. Elle did not gasp or laugh at the proper moments, instead gazing transfixed, lost in her own thoughts. Finally, after an hour or so, exhausted, the little Princess drifted to sleep, Ayda sat in an armchair close by watching her sister sleep fitfully. She planned to confront her Father and explain the fear she had witnessed in her once carefree sister, something had happened to her in that Chamber, and she needed to find out what.Ayda awoke shortly before the sun, sitting up quickly in the armchair she had slept in. Rising, she moved towards the balcony. It was still dark outside. Ayda breathed in the fresh morning air. It was likely she would be riding most of the morning to arrive at the border for midday, and she was still sore from yesterday’s sparring. In the reflection of the glass, she could watch her sister sleeping soundly in her bed. Moving towards her she placed a kiss on her forehead and murmured a quick farewell anxious to leave her in peace. Leaving the room as quietly as she could, passing the Protectors at the door, Ayda followed the white marble, spiral stairway down.‘Ayda, I guessed I would find you here.’ A gentle voice greeted her as she reached the base of the stairway.‘Father,’ Ayda replied, inclining her head slightly, the King raised his arms to embrace his eldest daughter. He squeezed her tightly against him, as if it was their last embrace.‘We will miss you, stay safe.’ He whispered into her hair.‘I will only be away for a matter of weeks Father,’ Ayda frowned, releasing herself from his hold.‘Ah, of course, but each day without your sharp wit pains us all!’ He winked at her.Ayda snorted. Her parents were always full of grace and decorum when surrounded by their peers. However, in private, she could not deny they were fully devoted to their daughters. When Ayda had informed them of her decision to join the Golden Army, they had been shocked, and had attempted to hide their disappointment that she would eventually renounce the Throne, but they had supported her. Their only request was for her to maintain her duties for a time, to protect her small sister from the pressures of the monarchy at such a fragile age. She had of course, consented. She knew in her heart, that when the time came, and Brielle had found her confidence, she would make a much stronger Queen.‘Have you spoken with Elle?’ The King asked gently.‘Yes, she is scared. I have not seen her this way before.’‘She has every right to be scared,’ Her Father sighed.‘What do you mean?’ The King placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and looked her straight in the eye.‘The Ritual was hard for her. She will need her sister to guide her and protect her.’ Ayda nodded instantly, confident that no matter what trials her sister faced, she would be there for her. However, she felt there was something that he was not telling her. His loving face had aged, she thought, there were lines and shadows under his eyes she had not noticed before. Concerned for her Father, she opened her mouth to speak.‘Father –’ Ayda began,‘You had better get going! You don’t want the Patrol to leave without you!’ He chuckled, punching her playfully on the arm. He was right, she was cutting it fine. She launched herself through the corridor without a backward glance at him. He was King she thought, he must have many demands and worries to make him appear thin. Relaxing, she flew out of the Castle and through the grounds, ready for her next Patrol.",

Her parents were always full of grace and decorum when surrounded by their peers. However, in private, she could not deny they were fully devoted to their daughters. When Ayda had informed them of her decision to join the Golden Army, they had been shocked, and had attempted to hide their disappointment that she would eventually renounce the Throne, but they had supported her. Their only request was for her to maintain her duties for a time, to protect her small sister from the pressures of the monarchy at such a fragile age. She had of course, consented. She knew in her heart, that when the time came, and Brielle had found her confidence, she would make a much stronger Queen.‘Have you spoken with Elle?’ The King asked gently.‘Yes, she is scared. I have not seen her this way before.’‘She has every right to be scared,’ Her Father sighed.‘What do you mean?’ The King placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and looked her straight in the eye.‘The Ritual was hard for her. She will need her sister to guide her and protect her.’ Ayda nodded instantly, confident that no matter what trials her sister faced, she would be there for her. However, she felt there was something that he was not telling her. His loving face had aged, she thought, there were lines and shadows under his eyes she had not noticed before. Concerned for her Father, she opened her mouth to speak.‘Father –’ Ayda began,‘You had better get going! You don’t want the Patrol to leave without you!’ He chuckled, punching her playfully on the arm. He was right, she was cutting it fine. She launched herself through the corridor without a backward glance at him. He was King she thought, he must have many demands and worries to make him appear thin. Relaxing, she flew out of the Castle and through the grounds, ready for her next Patrol.",

      "content": "5 – NIALLThe men and women in front of Niall were loyal. Scoundrels, yes, but they were his scoundrels. They had done many jobs together over the years, raided many manors, hunted troublesome men, and frequented more taverns and pubs than they could remember. Here they were, ready for more. Their dirty, scarred faces could tell many stories, their leather protective clothing had seen better days. Niall looked around at them all smiling. Taking a long swig of cider from his flagon, he wiped his mouth on his arm and opened his arms.‘My Fiends!’ He said loudly, grinning from ear to ear, ‘Tomorrow we undertake another brave and chivalrous task! Tomorrow, we will be bringing home riches to our wives and ladies!’ The men and women roared, banging their flasks loudly on the tables around him in celebration. Niall laughed loudly. Standing from his chair he finished his flagon and slammed it down on the table. A beautiful, curvy barmaid was leaning against the bar, watching, a smile playing on her bright red lips. The Bridge Inn was their favourite meeting place, it was a private, quiet inn on the outskirts of Oakwood Town. Niall liked it because it served his favourite Green Grain Cider, but also because Martha, the barmaid, was easy on the eye and easy elsewhere. It was widely known as The Hole, most people stayed away, but the Fiends made sure the pub lost no revenue for it. Niall gestured to the musician for the music to start, and a jovial violin sang its way through the Bridge Inn. Taking a seat between two men he clapped them both hard on the back.‘Good turnout for this one!’ Niall said loudly over the music.‘Word is travelling about your leadership for sure,’ His friend mused, ‘Everyone left the last raid with very heavy pockets!’‘Bryce has trust in you.’ Karl added sternly. Niall frowned at his friend.‘Bryce knows I care about Oakwood. I bring gold and resources. He benefits greatly.’ Niall dismissed with a wave of the hand. They both nodded.‘He is getting old, maybe he intends to put you forward as his successor.’ Niall ran his hands through his thick dark hair, he had grown into a good looking, rugged young man and was committed to the success of the people in his town. He had joined the Fiends ten years prior, after he helped a mysterious girl escape the town unnoticed by the guards. This feat had earned him the respect of Bryce, the Master of the Fiends, who tutored him carefully to become his Deputy. Bryce had approved of the young boy’s morality and believed that the Master of the Fiends should be wise enough to make smart decisions with the heart as well as the mind. The Fiends, after all, was an underground organisation to benefit the people who most needed their help. Karl and Theo were recruited with Niall as boys, they had trained in weaponry, surveillance and combat together and had become as brothers over the past decade. Theo had been a kind-hearted boy who had been chosen for taking a beating for his younger brother, loyalty the Fiends could not overlook in one so young. Karl was cunning and strong, he was an orphan who outwitted the Town Guards on many occasions, once succeeding in locking the Guards out of their own Barracks so he could feast on their stores. Now, all three were lethal. As a three, none in the Fiends could challenge their skill with a blade. Their ability to foresee each other and move together rendered every enemy powerless, as they rapidly struck blow after blow, never killing unless necessary. As was the strict code of the Fiends. Tomorrow, the Fiends were heading out to the border of Myrliar. The Elven Border patrols were being recalled early, scouts had informed them, leaving the Fiends with a clear evening to plunder the closest Elven Lords without too much of a fight.‘I cannot believe the Gold Army recalled their Patrol from the borders so early without reason.’ Karl said simply.‘What do you mean?’ Niall asked his friend.‘We have looted these Lords before, how could they be so foolish to leave them unprotected?’‘You smell a trap?’‘Yes. No Commander recalls border patrols without first sending relief.’ Niall nodded. This thought had occurred to him too. He had informed his scouts of his worry, they were to report straight back to him if they caught wind of any form of soldier movement at any point. The Patrol had not yet headed home, they were due to depart in the morning, according to their source the new Patrol would be arriving late that same evening.‘I have prepared for that my friend.’ Niall rested his arm on Karl’s broad shoulder. Karl was a mountain of a man. He had little to no sense of humour and simply said things how they were. Niall enjoyed the honesty, it was a relief to have a friend not afraid to tell you if you were in the wrong. Karl grunted and downed his drink, raising the tankard to a maid for a refill.‘If you are wrong, we do not have enough swords here to fight a Patrol.’ Karl said, staring at Niall firmly.‘Niall has not led us astray before, Karl.’ Theo soothed.‘Astray is probably the wrong word.’ Niall winked at them. Theo was the smallest of the three, his dirty blonde hair was tied back, and his frame was slight, making him light-footed and fast. His face was young and lacked the knowledge and edge of the others, but it was friendly and approachable. Karl did not respond. He had bowed to the inevitable that they were going, and he was to once again put his trust in his friends. He continued to glare at the wall, drinking.‘Such a merry soul.’ Niall jibed, elbowing him in the ribs. A slither of a smirk turned the corner of Karl’s mouth. Niall leaned back in his seat and crossed his arms above his head, kicking his feet up on to the table, sighing contentedly he looked over at Martha. One of his men was leaning over the bar to converse with her intensely, judging the look in his eye he was enthralled by her. Niall chuckled, Martha was stunning, and better, she was confident, she could easily disarm any man. Except Karl, Niall thought, he doubted there was a woman for Karl, if there was she would be damn scary. Martha caught his eye and sauntered over to their table where she sat herself comfortably on his lap.‘I see you caught yourself another fish,’ Niall said mockingly.‘I can’t help it you know, you Fiends love a damsel in distress, and I can never seem to convince you that I’m not her.’ She fluttered her eyelashes. Martha held herself in such a way that made her irresistible to him. He loved her confidence, when he was away he knew she could look after herself, she was never a victim. The things he saw her do with that silver dagger she kept hidden in her bodice, would be enough to deter him from getting on the wrong side of her, never mind a drunken brawler.‘Is Bryce going with you?’ She asked.‘No, he has business with a merchant at the Capital.’ Niall said, casually smoothing her dress.‘So, you’re the Boss again.’ She winked at him seductively.‘Well, I guess I am.’ He replied sweetly. Martha leaned forward to press herself against him. Karl rolled his eyes and removed himself from their presence muttering something under his breath, Theo blushing, quickly followed him to another table thick with smoke and choking laughter, leaving Martha and Niall alone.The room was small and dingy, an old wooden wardrobe, double bed and crooked table and chair was all the furniture it contained. Several beams of light shone through the moth bitten holes in the curtains, creating shapes on the wall opposite. It was mid-morning. The bed groaned as it’s occupant slowly sat up and adjusted his eyes to life. He was alone. Pulling back the bed linen, he hastened to his feet. Grabbing his shirt, he pulled it over his head to cover his bare chest and pulled on his trousers and boots. Running his fingers roughly through his hair and then flattening it he stopped as he heard someone on the other side of his door. A couple of taps echoed through the thin wood and it creaked open loudly.‘Morning,’ Martha sidled into the room, encumbered by a large bowl of water and fresh cloth. ‘I thought you might want to wash before you leave, the rest are starting to gather downstairs.’‘Thank you,’ Niall said, relieving her of her burden and setting it on the table. He pulled her into his arms, and smelled her heavy perfume filling him up. They stood there for a moment relishing each other’s warmth, knowing this would be the last time they would be alone for a while.‘Don’t wait for me.’ He said dully, she smiled knowingly in reply.‘You’d better hurry, they need you.’ She whispered, pulling free and leaving the room. Niall knew she understood, there was no love in their relationship, neither wanted it. They merely enjoyed the excitement and impulsive nature of each other. Whilst he cared for her, and she for him, they were friends and they didn’t need anything more complicated clouding their focus. Quickly, he washed the dregs of last night from his face and wet his hair, dampening it to flatten it. When he was done, the dusty floorboards creaked as he left the room.Downstairs, the men and women of the Fiends were sat, talking amongst themselves whilst eating their way through mounds of bread, eggs and cooked meats the kitchen had provided. Niall plonked himself heavily down next to Theo and Karl and helped himself to the food in silence, contemplating the task at hand. Once the scraping of knives and forks had subsided and the chatter began to quieten down into a room buzzing with silent expectation, Niall stood and took his place at the centre of the room.‘Here we are,’ He said clearly, loudly. ‘Today is the day we have been planning for. Today is the day we will journey as one into Myrliar. I don’t need to tell you how dangerous it is for us to travel there. You all know. We all know the dangers we humans face on the other side of that river. You know the plan. Stick with your group and we will return home, richer and fatter than ever.’ He began to pace around the room, joining hands with several of the Fiends. Several applauded, confident of the plan. Niall led the group from the hall, out into the yard where fifty horses stood tethered to fences and paddocks, laden with empty sacks. One by one, riders mounted their steed. Cheery and expectant faces looking towards their leader, hopeful of the riches this day would yield for their families. Leading the troop, Niall pushed his stallion into a walk, steady and strong legs pushed forwards through the dirt path, a mixture of coloured horses behind him carefully navigating the path through the fences. Finally, when he was sure everyone was following, Niall broke into a canter, moving confidently towards his target. Dust clouds followed as the troop followed the dirt path through the forest, several children playing in the undergrowth waved at them happily as they passed by. The thundering of hooves roared within him as his heartbeat quickened with excitement, faster they rode, the uneven ride tough on his joints as he bounded in his saddle. They rode on as the forest grew thicker, the grey skies hidden behind the tops of trees. Niall’s eyes were fixed forward in determination, eyeing the Myr Bridge in the distance he kicked his horse faster still, desperate to reach their quarry on time. The hordes followed, it must have been an impressive sight as the riders emerged in a tight force galloping towards the bridge, their leader pushing them harder as their hooves echoed across the fragile wooden bridge. Niall glimpsed upwards, noting the dark clouds rumbling as a cavalry charge towards them. He cursed quietly to himself.‘Could cause us problems!’ Karl said loudly to him as he rode up beside Niall. He nodded in agreement, they could have done with a clear day today. The storm had ridden in unnervingly fast. He felt water run down his face as the clouds liberated their wealth onto the ground below. Ignoring the rumbling thunder and the bright claps of light piercing the dark sky he pressed forward, never slowing, despite the heavying rainfall. Their horses began to squelch and whine through the sodden paths as the rain lashed down. The wind was fierce, and Niall could feel his stallion waning beneath him.‘We should turn back!’ Karl yelled through the storm. ‘The horses won’t be able to keep this up!’‘We’re nearly there!’ Niall replied loudly.‘This storm is punishing! How do you expect us to pull this job off Niall?!’ Looking behind, Niall noticed large numbers of his men turning tail and running back on their exhausted mounts, leaving swamp like paths in their wake as the earth struggled to hold water. Niall was not going to give up, he had been waiting for an opportunity for a long time, and he knew the Patrol would have left by now. They had to get there soon! Pushing on for an hour with only his closest friends now in tow, he nearly laughed with relief when he saw the white stone of the manor through the storm’s rainy veil. The rain was not slowing. His clothes were sticking to his skin and his hair was drenched through, his horse was breathing harshly beneath him as he slowed down to a brisk walk, not daring to slow too much for fear of becoming stuck in the earth.‘What’s the plan then?’ Karl snarled, water pouring off him, ‘There’s only six of us.’‘We’ll have to lower our expectations for a start.’ Niall muttered, squinting through the downpour. The small group moved forwards, each one soaked from head to toe, each weakened horse struggling to push through the sodden ground, fighting through the wind.‘We need to find somewhere dry, so we can make a new plan!’ Niall announced. Theo was pointing, following his finger, Niall saw an old, crumbling stone barn not far from them, and in view of the manor. He nodded at them, and quickly they rode their horses to shelter. Niall heaved himself off his stallion.‘Eurgh.’ He moaned as his boots sank deep into the mud. Creeping around the barn, he spied through the wooden door. Nodding to the others, he led his horse inside. For ten minutes, the barn was full of disgruntled scoffs and curses as they all dismounted and checked themselves and dried out as much as they could. Finding an old lantern, Niall lit and hung it from some old rope on the ceiling.‘Thank the Gods for that storm, they are really looking out for us!’ Niall said jovially.‘Why are you so damn cheerful?’ Karl demanded angrily, tipping his boots and letting the water pour from them.‘Why not? We are here, and the Patrol isn’t - as we planned!’ Niall smiled sarcastically at his wet friend.‘Aye, and most of our men are probably cosy by their fires right now!’ Karl spat.‘Well get going then! Why did you follow if you don’t want to be here?’ Niall asked, his temper flaring.‘Niall what do you plan to do? We are only six men.’ A quiet voice came from the corner.Spinning around, Niall watched as Theo rung out his messy hair and attempted to tie it back once more. The thunder growled, and lightning sparked the sky.‘This storm’s good for one thing - we’ll have to sneak in.’ Niall said simply.‘We should at least get some rest, that was a tough ride and we need our energy to get home.’ One of the companions suggested.‘No, there is only a small window until the new Patrol arrives, we must move quickly.’ Niall dismissed. Shaking his head, Karl picked up his gear from the floor in preparation, the other’s followed suit, clangs of metal sounding as each readied his weapons.‘I don’t like this Niall, not one bit.’ Karl said gruffly, staring his leader straight in the eye. ‘But I cannot walk away knowing you are likely to die.’ Niall rested his hand on Karl’s shoulder, a small smile playing on his lips.‘We are just going to have a look my friend, I will not put any of you at risk if nothing can be gained.’ Niall said softly. Karl nodded in acceptance. The door to the barn complained gently as it was slowly opened, and the group trailed out one by one, leaving the horses to rest in the dry. Niall, at the helm, crouched as low as he could and briskly crept carefully toward the dim flickering light emanating from the manor. The rain was lashing down, his comrades were close behind, but he could not hear the squelch of their boots in the sodden mud over the deafening roar of the storm. All around the sky was black and unyielding, the occasional flash of light flew overhead, lighting up the darkness for a split second. A couple of times, Niall had to roughly tug on his boot to free himself from the flooded fields. Finally, they reached the outer fence of the manor. The storm was unrelenting, showing no remorse to the suffering fields and the crops that gave up their hold, and began to float away sadly in the torrent. Keeping low, Niall approached a window of the manor. No sooner had he reached it, he ducked down from view with a gasp.‘Damn it!’ He cursed. Inside the hall of the manor, were several men dressed in rich golden armour, helmets laid aside as they were entrenched in deep conversation. The Patrol had not left.‘They must have changed their plans when the storm came.’ Karl muttered in his ear. Niall sighed. That was it, he thought. They could not risk a confrontation with the Patrol, they would all be slain for sure. He guessed the men in the hall were the leaders, so the Patrol must still be around. Hidden beneath the grey skies and curtain of fall. Niall had failed. He was going to be a laughing stock. All the months of planning, the perfect opportunity washed away by the storm. The damned storm! He screamed silently in his head. Where had this cursed storm come from? The ground had been bone dry, there had been no rain for months! With his face screwed up in disappointment he spun around and lead his men back to the horses, not taking care to stay hidden, too angry that this great haul had been robbed from him. Reaching the barn, he pulled open the creaky door and stepped inside. Stomping over to his horse he saddled up, hearing his comrades wordlessly doing the same. Each bitterly disappointed and exhausted from the rain and the effort this pointless raid had costed.‘Don’t even think of getting on those horses.’ A blade was at his throat. A figure roughly spun him around, the cold metal never leaving his skin. Looking to his comrades, he saw they too had been caught by surprise. Theo had a sword aimed steadily at his heart, Karl had his blade pressed upon his assailant but was also threatened by steel to the throat. Niall groaned in irritation. They had been bested. The only one out of the six to have realised the trap had been Karl, and he was in no better a position than him. Three more figures emerged from the dark shadows of the barn. Considering the face of his attacker he realised it was a woman, she had long dark hair and a hard face drenched by the rain. They must have walked straight passed them. He could have kicked himself.‘What are you doing here?’ A female voice asked. Niall looked towards the three from the shadows. All the attackers wore black cloaks. Each soaked to the bone, the cloaks clinging uncomfortably to their forms. He glimpsed the shape of amour beneath them, they had been cleverly disguised in the storm. The golden armour they wore beneath their cloaks would have been just enough to detect, but in the storm the black of the cloaks had made them invisible.‘Just seeking shelter from the rain ma’am.’ Niall said politely.‘Humans don’t seek shelter in Myrliar.’ She answered quickly. Stepping forwards, she lowered her hood and shook her head, shaking off the rain that was running down her face. Her blonde hair was cut short, her skin ghostly white, he was startled by her piercing blue eyes. He knew those eyes.‘We got lost.’ One of his companions said quietly. The Patrol laughed loudly. The woman holding Niall giggled quietly to herself, not loosening her grip on him. One of the Patrol was laughing whilst disarming each of them happily, examining each blade as he stole it from its sheath.‘Oh? You just happened to wander over the Myr Bridge by mistake, did you?’ The she-elf laughed.‘We should just kill them, Ayda, there is no point talking to them. They are all liars.’ One of the guards said clearly.‘Yes. That is the law, there is to be no human on Elven soil. Take them outside an end it.’ An older guard behind Ayda agreed nodding. Niall couldn’t take his eyes off Ayda’s face. It was her. It was Ayda. She was watching him, a cold stare reserved for his kind he guessed. Niall felt the elf holding him give one strong heave and he moved towards the door. He heard his comrades scream and curse as each were bustled and ripped away from each-other and pushed through the barn door. From the sounds of it, Karl was doing a good job of fighting off the guards and had now been upgraded to the honour of three captors to restrain him. The screams were drowned out as the thunder tore across the sky. He could not turn from Ayda. He had saved her - why was she letting them do this to him? She was watching him intently. Anger inside him grew, furiously he attempted to rip away from the she elf. Why was Ayda not helping? Then he saw it, a glimmer of recognition on her face. Her lips parted in slight surprise, as finally she remembered the boy he had been. As he continued to struggle with his guard, he saw it, the glitter of metal in the hand of a guard behind Ayda. He advanced towards her quickly, blade in hand, aimed for her.‘Ayda!’ Niall shouted in warning. Everything was a blur, immediately he found himself freed as his captor threw her blade with precision and planted it into the throat of the assassin. Ayda whipped around smartly and plunged her dagger into the stomach of the second who had stepped up soon after. Niall crossed over to her and found himself standing in her defence once more. This time he was not alone. The elf who had released him had her blade held high and was staring at him incredulously.‘He’s a friend Syren.’ Ayda said softly, eyeing him up. Making a split decision to trust him, as other guards in her Patrol turned to attack, Ayda passed him a dagger. Two more guards advanced, ducking a blow Niall spun around to neatly tackle the man to the floor. Just as Syren danced quickly behind and slit the other’s throat. Niall planted his fists one after the other into the Elf’s face, bloodied, he lay unconscious on the floor. ‘We need to leave!’ Niall yelled. The barn door smashed open and Karl and Theo ran in, bruised and battered and armed.‘What the hell is going on?’ Karl shouted advancing on Syren and Ayda. Niall dived in front.‘They are coming with us!’ Niall shouted, straining to be heard above the storm. Racing to the other end of the barn, Niall took a moment to calm down the horses who had been whinnying through the commotion as he took the reins and mounted. Gesturing to the other horses the others followed suit. Syren had to help Ayda onto a horse who was clearly shaken in disbelief. Leading the way out of the barn, Niall blasted through the doors and back into the peril of the storm. Welcomed by the sounds of metal on metal and dying elves, the horses raced away from the barn, the sounds of death and danger spurring them on.‘Run, Princess, run!’ A dying soldier screamed at Ayda as he dealt out blows to guards trying to mount other horses, until he was finally ended with a spear through the heart. They ran faster than ever before. The horses galloping through the storm, lightning cracked the sky, thunder laughing at them as they flew as far away from the manor as they could. Niall turned to see Ayda rushing to catch up to his side.‘We must go to the Stone City!’ She demanded through the weather.‘What? No! We need to get as far from here as possible!’ He yelled in reply.‘My sister needs me!’ She cried, even through the rain he could see the tears in her eyes.‘It’s too dangerous!’ Niall warned. Ayda shook her head and pulled her horse back to Syren. Then without another word, they changed course and ran west, their horses speeding off into the distance. Damn her, Niall thought. She’s still the stubborn girl she used to be. Checking that Theo and Karl were still with him, they ran on and on only resting when the Myr river came into view.‘They weren’t that interested in us.’ A gruff voice came.‘What do you mean?’ Niall asked, exhausted.‘As soon as were tackled outside, the guards started killing each other. I don’t know what started it.’ Theo said.‘The other lads got caught up in it, Kev took a bolt to the eye, but we managed to get back to you.’ Karl explained.‘Gods.’ Niall breathed, ‘They tried to kill Ayda.’‘That was the girl, wasn’t it? The elf girl you saved all those years ago.’ Theo whispered quietly. The storm had passed in the night. The ground was still flooded, and their hooves were still sliding in parts, but the air was quiet, and the rain had stopped.‘You know if she goes back to the Stone City, she’s dead.’ Karl said simply.‘That’s not our concern. She knows the risk.’ Niall waved a hand. Even as he said it he felt bitter. He was angry with her still, angry that she had put him through that and angry that she had once again left him without a word.‘If you didn’t care you wouldn’t have stepped in.’ Theo said slyly. Niall ignored him. He wanted the safety of Martha and her Tavern. However, he couldn’t shake the nagging regret since watching Ayda ride away. She had run towards danger to save her sister, he had run away from danger to save himself. His clothes were uncomfortably itchy, and the rain had left him cold to the bone. He longed for a hot meal and bath. As they approached the river, the sound of rushing water flooded over him. The river was a lot wider than he remembered. It had burst its banks.‘Unless you have a boat I think we’re stuck.’ Theo said hopelessly. He was right, the skeleton of the bridge could be seen sticking out of the flooded waters, but the rest of the bridge’s carcass had long been swept away by the deluge. The river was dirty, water from the fields had flown into its veins and the water was speeding south towards the sea. They could not go home. ‘There’s only one thing for it then.’ Niall said, his mind made up. ‘We go to the Stone City. She stole our horses.’",

Karl was a mountain of a man. He had little to no sense of humour and simply said things how they were. Niall enjoyed the honesty, it was a relief to have a friend not afraid to tell you if you were in the wrong. Karl grunted and downed his drink, raising the tankard to a maid for a refill.‘If you are wrong, we do not have enough swords here to fight a Patrol.’ Karl said, staring at Niall firmly.‘Niall has not led us astray before, Karl.’ Theo soothed.‘Astray is probably the wrong word.’ Niall winked at them. Theo was the smallest of the three, his dirty blonde hair was tied back, and his frame was slight, making him light-footed and fast. His face was young and lacked the knowledge and edge of the others, but it was friendly and approachable. Karl did not respond. He had bowed to the inevitable that they were going, and he was to once again put his trust in his friends. He continued to glare at the wall, drinking.‘Such a merry soul.’ Niall jibed, elbowing him in the ribs. A slither of a smirk turned the corner of Karl’s mouth. Niall leaned back in his seat and crossed his arms above his head, kicking his feet up on to the table, sighing contentedly he looked over at Martha. One of his men was leaning over the bar to converse with her intensely, judging the look in his eye he was enthralled by her. Niall chuckled, Martha was stunning, and better, she was confident, she could easily disarm any man. Except Karl, Niall thought, he doubted there was a woman for Karl, if there was she would be damn scary. Martha caught his eye and sauntered over to their table where she sat herself comfortably on his lap.‘I see you caught yourself another fish,’ Niall said mockingly.‘I can’t help it you know, you Fiends love a damsel in distress, and I can never seem to convince you that I’m not her.’ She fluttered her eyelashes. Martha held herself in such a way that made her irresistible to him. He loved her confidence, when he was away he knew she could look after herself, she was never a victim. The things he saw her do with that silver dagger she kept hidden in her bodice, would be enough to deter him from getting on the wrong side of her, never mind a drunken brawler.‘Is Bryce going with you?’ She asked.‘No, he has business with a merchant at the Capital.’ Niall said, casually smoothing her dress.‘So, you’re the Boss again.’ She winked at him seductively.‘Well, I guess I am.’ He replied sweetly. Martha leaned forward to press herself against him. Karl rolled his eyes and removed himself from their presence muttering something under his breath, Theo blushing, quickly followed him to another table thick with smoke and choking laughter, leaving Martha and Niall alone.The room was small and dingy, an old wooden wardrobe, double bed and crooked table and chair was all the furniture it contained. Several beams of light shone through the moth bitten holes in the curtains, creating shapes on the wall opposite. It was mid-morning. The bed groaned as it’s occupant slowly sat up and adjusted his eyes to life. He was alone. Pulling back the bed linen, he hastened to his feet. Grabbing his shirt, he pulled it over his head to cover his bare chest and pulled on his trousers and boots. Running his fingers roughly through his hair and then flattening it he stopped as he heard someone on the other side of his door. A couple of taps echoed through the thin wood and it creaked open loudly.‘Morning,’ Martha sidled into the room, encumbered by a large bowl of water and fresh cloth. ‘I thought you might want to wash before you leave, the rest are starting to gather downstairs.’‘Thank you,’ Niall said, relieving her of her burden and setting it on the table. He pulled her into his arms, and smelled her heavy perfume filling him up. They stood there for a moment relishing each other’s warmth, knowing this would be the last time they would be alone for a while.‘Don’t wait for me.’ He said dully, she smiled knowingly in reply.‘You’d better hurry, they need you.’ She whispered, pulling free and leaving the room. Niall knew she understood, there was no love in their relationship, neither wanted it. They merely enjoyed the excitement and impulsive nature of each other. Whilst he cared for her, and she for him, they were friends and they didn’t need anything more complicated clouding their focus. Quickly, he washed the dregs of last night from his face and wet his hair, dampening it to flatten it. When he was done, the dusty floorboards creaked as he left the room.Downstairs, the men and women of the Fiends were sat, talking amongst themselves whilst eating their way through mounds of bread, eggs and cooked meats the kitchen had provided. Niall plonked himself heavily down next to Theo and Karl and helped himself to the food in silence, contemplating the task at hand. Once the scraping of knives and forks had subsided and the chatter began to quieten down into a room buzzing with silent expectation, Niall stood and took his place at the centre of the room.‘Here we are,’ He said clearly, loudly. ‘Today is the day we have been planning for. Today is the day we will journey as one into Myrliar. I don’t need to tell you how dangerous it is for us to travel there. You all know. We all know the dangers we humans face on the other side of that river. You know the plan. Stick with your group and we will return home, richer and fatter than ever.’ He began to pace around the room, joining hands with several of the Fiends. Several applauded, confident of the plan. Niall led the group from the hall, out into the yard where fifty horses stood tethered to fences and paddocks, laden with empty sacks. One by one, riders mounted their steed. Cheery and expectant faces looking towards their leader, hopeful of the riches this day would yield for their families. Leading the troop, Niall pushed his stallion into a walk, steady and strong legs pushed forwards through the dirt path, a mixture of coloured horses behind him carefully navigating the path through the fences. Finally, when he was sure everyone was following, Niall broke into a canter, moving confidently towards his target. Dust clouds followed as the troop followed the dirt path through the forest, several children playing in the undergrowth waved at them happily as they passed by. The thundering of hooves roared within him as his heartbeat quickened with excitement, faster they rode, the uneven ride tough on his joints as he bounded in his saddle. They rode on as the forest grew thicker, the grey skies hidden behind the tops of trees. Niall’s eyes were fixed forward in determination, eyeing the Myr Bridge in the distance he kicked his horse faster still, desperate to reach their quarry on time. The hordes followed, it must have been an impressive sight as the riders emerged in a tight force galloping towards the bridge, their leader pushing them harder as their hooves echoed across the fragile wooden bridge. Niall glimpsed upwards, noting the dark clouds rumbling as a cavalry charge towards them. He cursed quietly to himself.‘Could cause us problems!’ Karl said loudly to him as he rode up beside Niall. He nodded in agreement, they could have done with a clear day today. The storm had ridden in unnervingly fast. He felt water run down his face as the clouds liberated their wealth onto the ground below. Ignoring the rumbling thunder and the bright claps of light piercing the dark sky he pressed forward, never slowing, despite the heavying rainfall. Their horses began to squelch and whine through the sodden paths as the rain lashed down. The wind was fierce, and Niall could feel his stallion waning beneath him.‘We should turn back!’ Karl yelled through the storm. ‘The horses won’t be able to keep this up!’‘We’re nearly there!’ Niall replied loudly.‘This storm is punishing! How do you expect us to pull this job off Niall?!’ Looking behind, Niall noticed large numbers of his men turning tail and running back on their exhausted mounts, leaving swamp like paths in their wake as the earth struggled to hold water. Niall was not going to give up, he had been waiting for an opportunity for a long time, and he knew the Patrol would have left by now. They had to get there soon! Pushing on for an hour with only his closest friends now in tow, he nearly laughed with relief when he saw the white stone of the manor through the storm’s rainy veil. The rain was not slowing. His clothes were sticking to his skin and his hair was drenched through, his horse was breathing harshly beneath him as he slowed down to a brisk walk, not daring to slow too much for fear of becoming stuck in the earth.‘What’s the plan then?’ Karl snarled, water pouring off him, ‘There’s only six of us.’‘We’ll have to lower our expectations for a start.’ Niall muttered, squinting through the downpour. The small group moved forwards, each one soaked from head to toe, each weakened horse struggling to push through the sodden ground, fighting through the wind.‘We need to find somewhere dry, so we can make a new plan!’ Niall announced. Theo was pointing, following his finger, Niall saw an old, crumbling stone barn not far from them, and in view of the manor. He nodded at them, and quickly they rode their horses to shelter. Niall heaved himself off his stallion.‘Eurgh.’ He moaned as his boots sank deep into the mud. Creeping around the barn, he spied through the wooden door. Nodding to the others, he led his horse inside. For ten minutes, the barn was full of disgruntled scoffs and curses as they all dismounted and checked themselves and dried out as much as they could. Finding an old lantern, Niall lit and hung it from some old rope on the ceiling.‘Thank the Gods for that storm, they are really looking out for us!’ Niall said jovially.‘Why are you so damn cheerful?’ Karl demanded angrily, tipping his boots and letting the water pour from them.‘Why not? We are here, and the Patrol isn’t - as we planned!’ Niall smiled sarcastically at his wet friend.‘Aye, and most of our men are probably cosy by their fires right now!’ Karl spat.‘Well get going then! Why did you follow if you don’t want to be here?’ Niall asked, his temper flaring.‘Niall what do you plan to do? We are only six men.’ A quiet voice came from the corner.Spinning around, Niall watched as Theo rung out his messy hair and attempted to tie it back once more. The thunder growled, and lightning sparked the sky.‘This storm’s good for one thing - we’ll have to sneak in.’ Niall said simply.‘We should at least get some rest, that was a tough ride and we need our energy to get home.’ One of the companions suggested.‘No, there is only a small window until the new Patrol arrives, we must move quickly.’ Niall dismissed. Shaking his head, Karl picked up his gear from the floor in preparation, the other’s followed suit, clangs of metal sounding as each readied his weapons.‘I don’t like this Niall, not one bit.’ Karl said gruffly, staring his leader straight in the eye. ‘But I cannot walk away knowing you are likely to die.’ Niall rested his hand on Karl’s shoulder, a small smile playing on his lips.‘We are just going to have a look my friend, I will not put any of you at risk if nothing can be gained.’ Niall said softly. Karl nodded in acceptance. The door to the barn complained gently as it was slowly opened, and the group trailed out one by one, leaving the horses to rest in the dry. Niall, at the helm, crouched as low as he could and briskly crept carefully toward the dim flickering light emanating from the manor. The rain was lashing down, his comrades were close behind, but he could not hear the squelch of their boots in the sodden mud over the deafening roar of the storm. All around the sky was black and unyielding, the occasional flash of light flew overhead, lighting up the darkness for a split second. A couple of times, Niall had to roughly tug on his boot to free himself from the flooded fields. Finally, they reached the outer fence of the manor. The storm was unrelenting, showing no remorse to the suffering fields and the crops that gave up their hold, and began to float away sadly in the torrent. Keeping low, Niall approached a window of the manor. No sooner had he reached it, he ducked down from view with a gasp.‘Damn it!’ He cursed. Inside the hall of the manor, were several men dressed in rich golden armour, helmets laid aside as they were entrenched in deep conversation. The Patrol had not left.‘They must have changed their plans when the storm came.’ Karl muttered in his ear. Niall sighed. That was it, he thought. They could not risk a confrontation with the Patrol, they would all be slain for sure. He guessed the men in the hall were the leaders, so the Patrol must still be around. Hidden beneath the grey skies and curtain of fall. Niall had failed. He was going to be a laughing stock. All the months of planning, the perfect opportunity washed away by the storm. The damned storm! He screamed silently in his head. Where had this cursed storm come from? The ground had been bone dry, there had been no rain for months! With his face screwed up in disappointment he spun around and lead his men back to the horses, not taking care to stay hidden, too angry that this great haul had been robbed from him. Reaching the barn, he pulled open the creaky door and stepped inside. Stomping over to his horse he saddled up, hearing his comrades wordlessly doing the same. Each bitterly disappointed and exhausted from the rain and the effort this pointless raid had costed.‘Don’t even think of getting on those horses.’ A blade was at his throat. A figure roughly spun him around, the cold metal never leaving his skin. Looking to his comrades, he saw they too had been caught by surprise. Theo had a sword aimed steadily at his heart, Karl had his blade pressed upon his assailant but was also threatened by steel to the throat. Niall groaned in irritation. They had been bested. The only one out of the six to have realised the trap had been Karl, and he was in no better a position than him. Three more figures emerged from the dark shadows of the barn. Considering the face of his attacker he realised it was a woman, she had long dark hair and a hard face drenched by the rain. They must have walked straight passed them. He could have kicked himself.‘What are you doing here?’ A female voice asked. Niall looked towards the three from the shadows. All the attackers wore black cloaks. Each soaked to the bone, the cloaks clinging uncomfortably to their forms. He glimpsed the shape of amour beneath them, they had been cleverly disguised in the storm. The golden armour they wore beneath their cloaks would have been just enough to detect, but in the storm the black of the cloaks had made them invisible.‘Just seeking shelter from the rain ma’am.’ Niall said politely.‘Humans don’t seek shelter in Myrliar.’ She answered quickly. Stepping forwards, she lowered her hood and shook her head, shaking off the rain that was running down her face. Her blonde hair was cut short, her skin ghostly white, he was startled by her piercing blue eyes. He knew those eyes.‘We got lost.’ One of his companions said quietly. The Patrol laughed loudly. The woman holding Niall giggled quietly to herself, not loosening her grip on him. One of the Patrol was laughing whilst disarming each of them happily, examining each blade as he stole it from its sheath.‘Oh? You just happened to wander over the Myr Bridge by mistake, did you?’ The she-elf laughed.‘We should just kill them, Ayda, there is no point talking to them. They are all liars.’ One of the guards said clearly.‘Yes. That is the law, there is to be no human on Elven soil. Take them outside an end it.’ An older guard behind Ayda agreed nodding. Niall couldn’t take his eyes off Ayda’s face. It was her. It was Ayda. She was watching him, a cold stare reserved for his kind he guessed. Niall felt the elf holding him give one strong heave and he moved towards the door. He heard his comrades scream and curse as each were bustled and ripped away from each-other and pushed through the barn door. From the sounds of it, Karl was doing a good job of fighting off the guards and had now been upgraded to the honour of three captors to restrain him. The screams were drowned out as the thunder tore across the sky. He could not turn from Ayda. He had saved her - why was she letting them do this to him? She was watching him intently. Anger inside him grew, furiously he attempted to rip away from the she elf. Why was Ayda not helping? Then he saw it, a glimmer of recognition on her face. Her lips parted in slight surprise, as finally she remembered the boy he had been. As he continued to struggle with his guard, he saw it, the glitter of metal in the hand of a guard behind Ayda. He advanced towards her quickly, blade in hand, aimed for her.‘Ayda!’ Niall shouted in warning. Everything was a blur, immediately he found himself freed as his captor threw her blade with precision and planted it into the throat of the assassin. Ayda whipped around smartly and plunged her dagger into the stomach of the second who had stepped up soon after. Niall crossed over to her and found himself standing in her defence once more. This time he was not alone. The elf who had released him had her blade held high and was staring at him incredulously.‘He’s a friend Syren.’ Ayda said softly, eyeing him up. Making a split decision to trust him, as other guards in her Patrol turned to attack, Ayda passed him a dagger. Two more guards advanced, ducking a blow Niall spun around to neatly tackle the man to the floor. Just as Syren danced quickly behind and slit the other’s throat. Niall planted his fists one after the other into the Elf’s face, bloodied, he lay unconscious on the floor. ‘We need to leave!’ Niall yelled. The barn door smashed open and Karl and Theo ran in, bruised and battered and armed.‘What the hell is going on?’ Karl shouted advancing on Syren and Ayda. Niall dived in front.‘They are coming with us!’ Niall shouted, straining to be heard above the storm. Racing to the other end of the barn, Niall took a moment to calm down the horses who had been whinnying through the commotion as he took the reins and mounted. Gesturing to the other horses the others followed suit. Syren had to help Ayda onto a horse who was clearly shaken in disbelief. Leading the way out of the barn, Niall blasted through the doors and back into the peril of the storm. Welcomed by the sounds of metal on metal and dying elves, the horses raced away from the barn, the sounds of death and danger spurring them on.‘Run, Princess, run!’ A dying soldier screamed at Ayda as he dealt out blows to guards trying to mount other horses, until he was finally ended with a spear through the heart. They ran faster than ever before. The horses galloping through the storm, lightning cracked the sky, thunder laughing at them as they flew as far away from the manor as they could. Niall turned to see Ayda rushing to catch up to his side.‘We must go to the Stone City!’ She demanded through the weather.‘What? No! We need to get as far from here as possible!’ He yelled in reply.‘My sister needs me!’ She cried, even through the rain he could see the tears in her eyes.‘It’s too dangerous!’ Niall warned. Ayda shook her head and pulled her horse back to Syren. Then without another word, they changed course and ran west, their horses speeding off into the distance. Damn her, Niall thought. She’s still the stubborn girl she used to be. Checking that Theo and Karl were still with him, they ran on and on only resting when the Myr river came into view.‘They weren’t that interested in us.’ A gruff voice came.‘What do you mean?’ Niall asked, exhausted.‘As soon as were tackled outside, the guards started killing each other. I don’t know what started it.’ Theo said.‘The other lads got caught up in it, Kev took a bolt to the eye, but we managed to get back to you.’ Karl explained.‘Gods.’ Niall breathed, ‘They tried to kill Ayda.’‘That was the girl, wasn’t it? The elf girl you saved all those years ago.’ Theo whispered quietly. The storm had passed in the night. The ground was still flooded, and their hooves were still sliding in parts, but the air was quiet, and the rain had stopped.‘You know if she goes back to the Stone City, she’s dead.’ Karl said simply.‘That’s not our concern. She knows the risk.’ Niall waved a hand. Even as he said it he felt bitter. He was angry with her still, angry that she had put him through that and angry that she had once again left him without a word.‘If you didn’t care you wouldn’t have stepped in.’ Theo said slyly. Niall ignored him. He wanted the safety of Martha and her Tavern. However, he couldn’t shake the nagging regret since watching Ayda ride away. She had run towards danger to save her sister, he had run away from danger to save himself. His clothes were uncomfortably itchy, and the rain had left him cold to the bone. He longed for a hot meal and bath. As they approached the river, the sound of rushing water flooded over him. The river was a lot wider than he remembered. It had burst its banks.‘Unless you have a boat I think we’re stuck.’ Theo said hopelessly. He was right, the skeleton of the bridge could be seen sticking out of the flooded waters, but the rest of the bridge’s carcass had long been swept away by the deluge. The river was dirty, water from the fields had flown into its veins and the water was speeding south towards the sea. They could not go home. ‘There’s only one thing for it then.’ Niall said, his mind made up. ‘We go to the Stone City. She stole our horses.’",

      "content": "6 – ELLEAyda had not been there when Brielle had awoken, but Elle could tell from the impression left in the armchair cushions that she must have stayed well into the night. The gentle tapping of raindrops softened the harsh silence of a cold and dreary morning. Brielle watched the trail of tears slowly descend the glass and unite in a puddle. She stretched as she wandered over to the closed balcony doors, pressing her face against the cool glass she watched her breath fog on the inside. The gardens were rejoicing in the sudden downpour, water droplets were dancing off marble sculptures and pools happily bursting with overflow. It was early, the sun was shadowed, Ayda was probably riding to the border by now. Elle already missed her. Amie tapped on the door and walked in with a breakfast tray.‘Good Morning Princess,’ She smiled warmly.‘Hello Amie.’ Elle replied, sitting before the silver tray and cutting up her eggs and toast.‘What are your plans for today?’ Amie had started making up the bed. Elle shook her head, her mouth too full of egg to respond, though she didn’t feel much like eating, she knew Amie would fuss if she didn’t at least eat something.‘I think the young ones are going to be leaving with their parents tomorrow, so maybe you can play with them today?’ Amie continued kindly. Elle didn’t feel like playing today, the weather outside matched her mood perfectly. She had had nightmares all night about the screaming girl. She was tired and aching from tossing and turning most of the night. There was a nagging darkness at the back of her mind that something was amiss, but she was too scared to talk. She yawned widely.‘Oh dear, maybe we should tuck you back into bed?’ Amie said, concerned, immediately noticing the young Princess’s fatigue. As Amie, lead the Princess back to her bed, a thundering knock resounded through the room.‘I am commanded to escort the Princess to the Throne room.’ A Protector shouted clearly through the door. Amie smiled and rose to her feet winking at Elle.‘The King has need of you sweet Princess. I’ll just ask the Protector for time for you to dress.’ Striding confidently over to the large oak doors, the moment the handle was turned, the doors flew open and threw the young elf to the other side of the chamber. Brielle screamed as the huge Protector picked up her maid by the throat.‘Run Elle!’ Amie whimpered, before the Protector threw her from the balcony. Brielle jumped up and sprinted from the room, her nightdress flapping around her ankles as she ran from her chambers. She scurried down the spiral staircase and slammed straight into a wall of gold.‘Got her!’ Someone grabbed her arms painfully and picked her up as if she weighed no more than air. Kicking and screaming, Brielle struggled restlessly. Crying out for her mother and father, weeping for Amie. The Protectors were supposed to keep her safe – what was happening? Finally, she was thrown to the floor. The cold hard stone floor hurt her face as she was shoved into it, the force causing her to flinch for a moment before the wailing continued.‘Ah, good morning Princess Elle!’ A warm voice welcomed her. Blinking stars from her eyes from the fall, Elle looked up hopefully. Her mother and father’s thrones were in front of her, undamaged, strong and standing tall as usual. Seeing them gave her strength. Her parents were King and Queen, this act of aggression would be treason. Looking around, there were twenty or so Elves dressed head to toe in Golden Armour, she could no longer tell which one had mercilessly carried her or which one had murdered poor, innocent Amie.‘Where is my father the King?’ She whimpered quietly, looking at the man stood by the throne. He was dressed in a blood red cloak, his face covered by a black and gold detailed half-mask. She recognised the garb from stories told by the Temple of Scholars. He was of the Legion.‘He – ah – will be joining us shortly. Your mother too if we’re lucky!’ The man said happily, wringing his hands. At that moment, a loud crash resounded through the throne room, several Golden clad soldiers clattered into the room, dragging a middle-aged man between them. Brielle watched in horror as the kindly face of her father hit the floor when the Guards shoved him brutally to the ground. Brielle screamed out for him and crawled over to him, helping him to his knees. Clutching him closely she glared up at the Guard who was whispering to the red cloaked man. She was struggling to keep herself steady. Her heart was hammering against her chest and her body was shaking in fear. Her Father’s weakness and harsh breathing were not giving her hope.‘Let my daughter go.’ He commanded, clearly. Pushing himself up feebly, the fallen King regained his footing and straightened up, his eyes fixed on the leader.‘Now why would I do that?’ The masked man swept down towards him, his face inches away from the King’s. ‘You have displeased the Elder’s in the most unforgivable way.’ He spat.‘I have always fully supported the Elders, always acted upon their will.” The King said calmly and clearly, his eyes locked in silent combat with the Captain.‘Almost always.’ The Captain smiled, revealing a full set of perfect teeth.‘If I have angered the Elders my daughter need not pay for it!’ The King declared. Brielle watched with fire roaring in her heart as her Father stood tall despite obvious injury. Her eyes watered as she heard the slightest plea in which he hoped to save her from this misery. He had positioned himself between her and the Captain, determined that none should harm his child. Watching him, Elle knew it would be only too easy for him to overpowered physically, and yet no one here seemed to care that he was their King. The power her father once had was gone.‘Do what you are here to do.’ The King said calmly, ‘Please spare my daughter.’ The Captain laughed a cold and cruel laugh, many of the golden clad audience chuckled with him. Elle used the opportunity to seek a friendly face, one of the Guard must still support them! Sir Rakel was not here, nor Sir Morcei. She recognised no one. They were alone. It was just her and her father against all these battle-hardened Knights. The fire in her heart flickered, she could see no way out. Her Father’s strength had dried her tears, she felt them dry and stiff on her cheeks. She would be a strong Princess, like Ayda, not a child.‘It is because of your little elf that I am here.’ The Captain said softly. Instantly a buzzing vibration reverberated through the air, at the same moment bolts of white lightning sparked from the Captain’s hands aiming straight for Brielle’s heart. She froze in fear, but the lightning struck an invisible barrier that surrounded her. The invisible barrier vibrated louder with each pulse of lightning that coursed through it leaving ripples in the surface. Elle screamed, not understanding what was happening. The lightning was bright white and dazzling her, she braced herself for the pain she was sure to endure as the lightning continued to batter the shield. Finally, after long moments of holding her breath, the attack ceased.‘Yet another rule broken your Majesty.’ The Captain jested, beginning to circle around the pair, ‘No-one is allowed magic!’‘I swore never to use it!’ The King barked back, ‘But you threatened my daughter.’‘Very well,’ The Captain replied, ‘You first then.’ A split second brought more power forth. Elle was still on her knees, staring transfixed as her Father shielded and blocked repeatedly strong sparks of power with invisible barriers. Her father had magic! Elle’s mouth was open. She had not known. Magic had all but disappeared in Myrliar, she knew the Elder’s had magic, but no-one had been born with the gift for centuries! Yet her father was here, defending her with shields of power, concentrating with all his strength. Occasional bursts of power shot at her randomly, testing, but her father deflected them. Movement all around alerted her to the Guards, some were fleeing the room! We could win Elle thought excitedly. Getting to her feet, Brielle watched with her heart in her mouth, hoping her father had enough strength to get them out of here.He didn’t. As his power ebbed, the shocks ripped through his weakened shield and seared through his body, his mouth and eyes wide in shock as he stood paralyzed by the electricity coursing through his body. The Captain laughed coldly as a remaining Guard plunged his sword deep into the King’s back. The world around Elle fell away, as she watched her Father, the King’s body fall to the ground. Brielle could feel the piercing cold of ice smother the once roaring flame where her heart used to be. She could not stop her hands from shaking, no longer from fear, but from anger. An anger so deep it filled every inch of her body she felt close to vomiting. Her father was dead. Tears fell from her cheeks as she lost control, she raged, every ounce of pain exploded from within her. She felt power flow through her, the exhaustion and fear that had before suffocated her now fuelled her power. The ground grumbled and shuddered violently beneath her feet and the great white walls of the Castle’s Throne Room cracked and crumbled as Elle’s power grew. The muffled sounds of screaming and death filled her ears distantly as the ceilings gave way and crushed the Guards below. She could hear metal armour scraping the floor as survivors attempted to drag themselves away from the wreckage. The storm outside grew as monstrous as her soul, the sky was black as shadow, thunder and lightning cracking the air ferociously. Elle never noticed the huge glass windows behind her parent’s thrones explode and impale several Guards running from her, she never noticed as the ground around her gave way, bodies falling into the mountainous abyss below. She wanted to hear them scream, see life leave their bodies, and she wanted nothing more than to cause their pain. Several blasts of power bounced against her shield, a shield she never knew she’d created. The masked man of the Legion was in front of her, levitating above the emptiness she had created. She focussed on him, the battering of his power against her shield was barely noticeable. The debris around her stampeded towards him, his shield held – just. Shocked, the Captain withdrew, with one sharp lightning lance that pierced the darkness and blinded her. Frustrated, Elle spun around in search of him, he was gone. Casting out the last of her magic, destroying anything in her path, she caught sight of someone slipping away. She was lost in her pain. He meant something to her. His body was sliding, slowly towards the crater she had ripped into the earth. Soon he would be swallowed by darkness. She was lost. Her anger and hatred had consumed her. Tears filled her eyes again as she remembered and found herself regaining control. Her father. Just in time, she used the last of her magic to grab him and lift him to her. Her father. She had nearly lost him forever, he had nearly fallen. Silence enveloped her as her magic faded. The storm quietened to its natural grumble. All she could hear was her ragged breathing, her body still shaking. She clutched him and buried her face in his bloodstained clothes. Elle looked into her father’s staring eyes realising with a heart wrenching sob, she had lost him forever. He had fallen.",

      "content": "6 – ELLEAyda had not been there when Brielle had awoken, but Elle could tell from the impression left in the armchair cushions that she must have stayed well into the night. The gentle tapping of raindrops softened the harsh silence of a cold and dreary morning. Brielle watched the trail of tears slowly descend the glass and unite in a puddle. She stretched as she wandered over to the closed balcony doors, pressing her face against the cool glass she watched her breath fog on the inside. The gardens were rejoicing in the sudden downpour, water droplets were dancing off marble sculptures and pools happily bursting with overflow. It was early, the sun was shadowed, Ayda was probably riding to the border by now. Elle already missed her. Amie tapped on the door and walked in with a breakfast tray.‘Good Morning Princess,’ She smiled warmly.‘Hello Amie.’ Elle replied, sitting before the silver tray and cutting up her eggs and toast.‘What are your plans for today?’ Amie had started making up the bed. Elle shook her head, her mouth too full of egg to respond, though she didn’t feel much like eating, she knew Amie would fuss if she didn’t at least eat something.‘I think the young ones are going to be leaving with their parents tomorrow, so maybe you can play with them today?’ Amie continued kindly. Elle didn’t feel like playing today, the weather outside matched her mood perfectly. She had had nightmares all night about the screaming girl. She was tired and aching from tossing and turning most of the night. There was a nagging darkness at the back of her mind that something was amiss, but she was too scared to talk. She yawned widely.‘Oh dear, maybe we should tuck you back into bed?’ Amie said, concerned, immediately noticing the young Princess’s fatigue. As Amie, lead the Princess back to her bed, a thundering knock resounded through the room.‘I am commanded to escort the Princess to the Throne room.’ A Protector shouted clearly through the door. Amie smiled and rose to her feet winking at Elle.‘The King has need of you sweet Princess. I’ll just ask the Protector for time for you to dress.’ Striding confidently over to the large oak doors, the moment the handle was turned, the doors flew open and threw the young elf to the other side of the chamber. Brielle screamed as the huge Protector picked up her maid by the throat.‘Run Elle!’ Amie whimpered, before the Protector threw her from the balcony. Brielle jumped up and sprinted from the room, her nightdress flapping around her ankles as she ran from her chambers. She scurried down the spiral staircase and slammed straight into a wall of gold.‘Got her!’ Someone grabbed her arms painfully and picked her up as if she weighed no more than air. Kicking and screaming, Brielle struggled restlessly. Crying out for her mother and father, weeping for Amie. The Protectors were supposed to keep her safe – what was happening? Finally, she was thrown to the floor. The cold hard stone floor hurt her face as she was shoved into it, the force causing her to flinch for a moment before the wailing continued.‘Ah, good morning Princess Elle!’ A warm voice welcomed her. Blinking stars from her eyes from the fall, Elle looked up hopefully. Her mother and father’s thrones were in front of her, undamaged, strong and standing tall as usual. Seeing them gave her strength. Her parents were King and Queen, this act of aggression would be treason. Looking around, there were twenty or so Elves dressed head to toe in Golden Armour, she could no longer tell which one had mercilessly carried her or which one had murdered poor, innocent Amie.‘Where is my father the King?’ She whimpered quietly, looking at the man stood by the throne. He was dressed in a blood red cloak, his face covered by a black and gold detailed half-mask. She recognised the garb from stories told by the Temple of Scholars. He was of the Legion.‘He – ah – will be joining us shortly. Your mother too if we’re lucky!’ The man said happily, wringing his hands. At that moment, a loud crash resounded through the throne room, several Golden clad soldiers clattered into the room, dragging a middle-aged man between them. Brielle watched in horror as the kindly face of her father hit the floor when the Guards shoved him brutally to the ground. Brielle screamed out for him and crawled over to him, helping him to his knees. Clutching him closely she glared up at the Guard who was whispering to the red cloaked man. She was struggling to keep herself steady. Her heart was hammering against her chest and her body was shaking in fear. Her Father’s weakness and harsh breathing were not giving her hope.‘Let my daughter go.’ He commanded, clearly. Pushing himself up feebly, the fallen King regained his footing and straightened up, his eyes fixed on the leader.‘Now why would I do that?’ The masked man swept down towards him, his face inches away from the King’s. ‘You have displeased the Elder’s in the most unforgivable way.’ He spat.‘I have always fully supported the Elders, always acted upon their will.” The King said calmly and clearly, his eyes locked in silent combat with the Captain.‘Almost always.’ The Captain smiled, revealing a full set of perfect teeth.‘If I have angered the Elders my daughter need not pay for it!’ The King declared. Brielle watched with fire roaring in her heart as her Father stood tall despite obvious injury. Her eyes watered as she heard the slightest plea in which he hoped to save her from this misery. He had positioned himself between her and the Captain, determined that none should harm his child. Watching him, Elle knew it would be only too easy for him to overpowered physically, and yet no one here seemed to care that he was their King. The power her father once had was gone.‘Do what you are here to do.’ The King said calmly, ‘Please spare my daughter.’ The Captain laughed a cold and cruel laugh, many of the golden clad audience chuckled with him. Elle used the opportunity to seek a friendly face, one of the Guard must still support them! Sir Rakel was not here, nor Sir Morcei. She recognised no one. They were alone. It was just her and her father against all these battle-hardened Knights. The fire in her heart flickered, she could see no way out. Her Father’s strength had dried her tears, she felt them dry and stiff on her cheeks. She would be a strong Princess, like Ayda, not a child.‘It is because of your little elf that I am here.’ The Captain said softly. Instantly a buzzing vibration reverberated through the air, at the same moment bolts of white lightning sparked from the Captain’s hands aiming straight for Brielle’s heart. She froze in fear, but the lightning struck an invisible barrier that surrounded her. The invisible barrier vibrated louder with each pulse of lightning that coursed through it leaving ripples in the surface. Elle screamed, not understanding what was happening. The lightning was bright white and dazzling her, she braced herself for the pain she was sure to endure as the lightning continued to batter the shield. Finally, after long moments of holding her breath, the attack ceased.‘Yet another rule broken your Majesty.’ The Captain jested, beginning to circle around the pair, ‘No-one is allowed magic!’‘I swore never to use it!’ The King barked back, ‘But you threatened my daughter.’‘Very well,’ The Captain replied, ‘You first then.’ A split second brought more power forth. Elle was still on her knees, staring transfixed as her Father shielded and blocked repeatedly strong sparks of power with invisible barriers. Her father had magic! Elle’s mouth was open. She had not known. Magic had all but disappeared in Myrliar, she knew the Elder’s had magic, but no-one had been born with the gift for centuries! Yet her father was here, defending her with shields of power, concentrating with all his strength. Occasional bursts of power shot at her randomly, testing, but her father deflected them. Movement all around alerted her to the Guards, some were fleeing the room! We could win Elle thought excitedly. Getting to her feet, Brielle watched with her heart in her mouth, hoping her father had enough strength to get them out of here.He didn’t. As his power ebbed, the shocks ripped through his weakened shield and seared through his body, his mouth and eyes wide in shock as he stood paralyzed by the electricity coursing through his body. The Captain laughed coldly as a remaining Guard plunged his sword deep into the King’s back. The world around Elle fell away, as she watched her Father, the King’s body fall to the ground. Brielle could feel the piercing cold of ice smother the once roaring flame where her heart used to be. She could not stop her hands from shaking, no longer from fear, but from anger. An anger so deep it filled every inch of her body she felt close to vomiting. Her father was dead. Tears fell from her cheeks as she lost control, she raged, every ounce of pain exploded from within her. She felt power flow through her, the exhaustion and fear that had before suffocated her now fuelled her power. The ground grumbled and shuddered violently beneath her feet and the great white walls of the Castle’s Throne Room cracked and crumbled as Elle’s power grew. The muffled sounds of screaming and death filled her ears distantly as the ceilings gave way and crushed the Guards below. She could hear metal armour scraping the floor as survivors attempted to drag themselves away from the wreckage. The storm outside grew as monstrous as her soul, the sky was black as shadow, thunder and lightning cracking the air ferociously. Elle never noticed the huge glass windows behind her parent’s thrones explode and impale several Guards running from her, she never noticed as the ground around her gave way, bodies falling into the mountainous abyss below. She wanted to hear them scream, see life leave their bodies, and she wanted nothing more than to cause their pain. Several blasts of power bounced against her shield, a shield she never knew she’d created. The masked man of the Legion was in front of her, levitating above the emptiness she had created. She focussed on him, the battering of his power against her shield was barely noticeable. The debris around her stampeded towards him, his shield held – just. Shocked, the Captain withdrew, with one sharp lightning lance that pierced the darkness and blinded her. Frustrated, Elle spun around in search of him, he was gone. Casting out the last of her magic, destroying anything in her path, she caught sight of someone slipping away. She was lost in her pain. He meant something to her. His body was sliding, slowly towards the crater she had ripped into the earth. Soon he would be swallowed by darkness. She was lost. Her anger and hatred had consumed her. Tears filled her eyes again as she remembered and found herself regaining control. Her father. Just in time, she used the last of her magic to grab him and lift him to her. Her father. She had nearly lost him forever, he had nearly fallen. Silence enveloped her as her magic faded. The storm quietened to its natural grumble. All she could hear was her ragged breathing, her body still shaking. She clutched him and buried her face in his bloodstained clothes. Elle looked into her father’s staring eyes realising with a heart wrenching sob, she had lost him forever. He had fallen.",

      "content": "7– AYDAThe storm had taken its toll on them. Ayda’s cloak was soaked through and clinging to her frame, water running off the light armour beneath. Syren’s red hair was darkened with water and stuck flat to her body. Their horses were broken, exhausted from the hard ride through the dense forest that surrounded the First Wall of Myrliar. The wall was now visible, the storm had finally cleared as quickly as it had raged. The rain and winds had been heavy when she had left Niall, but that storm had turned deadly and angry almost instantly, as if the Elder’s themselves had conjured it. The clouds had thundered in black and dark, haunting the world. Ayda had not slowed despite the danger, she was desperate to get her little sister to safety. The treachery of her comrades clung painfully at her heart, she would mourn their friendship later, for now, she had to get to Elle.‘We can’t just walk into the City, someone clearly wants you dead.” Syren said quietly to Ayda.‘We have to find a way in and quickly,’ Ayda insisted, attempting to hide the panic in her voice, she could not bear to think what could be happening to her family, they could already be dead. No, she thought, I cannot think like that. Hiding their weak horses in the brush, Ayda and Syren slowly approached the First Wall, hiding behind a cluster of trees, they scoured the wall. The Wall towered above the ancient trees of the forest. Small, iron barred windows were dotted along it, figures of Guards and Soldiers could be seen moving from window to window carrying out their daily duties. Ayda was grateful for her training, as a Soldier of the Golden Army she knew the First Wall and the Barracks within very well. If they were careful maybe they could sneak through unnoticed.‘They’ve closed the gates!’ Syren whispered urgently. Ayda’s eyes snapped to the entrance of the Wall, the huge stone and steel gates were down and sealed, shielding Myrliar from any unwanted visitors. Ayda sighed, the situation had gone from difficult to impossible. The gates of the First Wall were only ever closed at time of war with the Humans, in her lifetime, she could not remember them being sealed once. Were they keeping her out, or her family in?‘What do we do?’ Syren asked, still crouching low behind the trees next to her. Ayda looked around helplessly for inspiration, she felt the panic rising, she had no idea how they could penetrate a wall that an Army could not bring down. She considered scaling it, but the white stone was so smooth they were not going to get a foothold. ‘I could always try to sneak in, the Guards are looking for you not me.’ Syren suggested. The thought had occurred to Ayda, but she had no idea how her friend would explain being without the Patrol, they must know they were close sparring partners. It was too dangerous. She relayed these thoughts to the red-haired elf.‘So, we can’t climb, dig or walk in.’ Syren muttered, kicking the dirt in frustration. Ayda ignored her friend. A sickness had crept to her stomach and was threatening to pull her on all fours. Her little sister was so far away from her. Ayda had been able to fight her way out with help from her friends, but Elle was so small, so weak, she would stand no chance of getting away from the Army. Then there were her parents, the King and Queen of Myrliar. Had they lost power? Had someone risen and removed them from their Throne? Was anyone in that Castle fighting for them? Ayda felt helpless, she had ridden hard against the ferocious storm to help her family, but she was still no nearer to holding her little sister. Syren, spotting the look of defeat on Ayda’s face moved forwards.‘I’m sure she is safe, no-one could deem your sister a threat, Sir Rakel or Sir Morcei would have got them out, I’m sure of it.’ At the mention of Sir Rakel, a spark ignited, fighting the deep despair in which she had begun to drown. He was a lifelong friend of her Father, no matter what, he would be standing with her family. She smiled weakly at her comrade.‘I thought you two would be in and out by now!’ Someone called to them close by. Three men climbed through the thicket towards them. The leader walked lazily, swinging his arms with a carefree look on his face. The two men behind looked much less at ease, both with their hands firmly around the hilt of their favourite blade.‘What are you doing here?’ Ayda spat at Niall.‘That is not nice.’ Niall jested, ‘I thought Princesses were supposed to have manners.’ He dipped quickly into a bow with a smile on his face, the handsome young man to his left smirked.Niall clapped his hands together carelessly. ‘So, what’s the plan your Highness?’‘What?’ Ayda asked confused.‘How are we getting in there to get the little Elf?’ Theo asked enthusiastically from Niall’s left. Ayda blushed, embarrassed. She had no plan. She had absolutely no idea how to get into her own home. Niall laughed loudly. Karl smacked him on the back with a firm ‘Quiet!’ which silenced him momentarily. ‘The Princess doesn’t know her own home Karl – it’s funny.’‘What are you going on about?! Do YOU know how to get in? You’ve never even been here before.’ Ayda spat angrily at him for mocking her. Niall shrugged.‘Here’s the deal. I’ll get you in that Castle, get your little Princess and then we take our horses back.’ Niall said simply. Ayda felt a slight annoyance at the bargain. So, he had not come back to help her, he just wanted what was his.‘Fine.’ She snapped. Niall grabbed her hand and shook it so excessively, she knew he was playing with her. She was not in the mood for his games, she wanted to see her family so desperately she would do anything it took. Niall gestured for them to follow him. Ayda followed him and his friends at a slight distance, she heard him complaining to Karl about the smack he had received and rolled her eyes.‘Where do you think he’s taking us?’ Syren whispered to her as she walked close by.‘I have no idea. He seems to know where he’s going though.’ Ayda replied quietly.‘I think we should get rid of them. It’s the law, I don’t trust them.’ Syren said, her voice full of loathing. Ayda knew her friend would be distrustful of the humans, Syren didn’t have any kind memories of any that she had encountered, all she saw was pain and years of hate. Ayda looked at the young man prancing in front of her. Niall was certainly the boy she had met when she was a child. He was still naughty and mischievous, she was curious as to his sudden knowledge of Myrliar. Ayda had not been too happy to see him, memories of her old friend had resurfaced upon seeing his face, a past she wished would stay in the shadows where it belonged. How annoying that Niall should save her life not once – but twice! Niall continued leading the way, she knew they were following the outer wall round as the five of them traipsed through the forest surrounding the Stone City. They grew closer and closer to the Pearl Mountains.‘If you’re planning on climbing the Pearl Mountains to get to the Castle then stop. There are Patrols protecting the Castle from anyone attempting this.’ Ayda called to him. Niall ignored her and walked on. Furious at being ignored, she sped up to him.‘How can you possibly know where we’re going?’ She demanded.‘Do you want to stand here and talk, or do you want to get to your family?’ He said exasperated. She nodded, agreeing that the conversation could wait until she had Elle under her wing. Ayda was angry with him though, his whole demeanour angered her. Her family was ruined, and he was taking a daily stroll through the forest. How can he know more about this Castle than her? He was a stranger, and this was her home. The mountains were so close now, clusters of brilliant white boulders were dotted around the forest and against the First Wall. She felt no nearer to her sister. ‘You two wait here.’ Niall said without looking at them. He, Theo and Karl, swords raised wandered behind a group of rocks, larger than two homes and disappeared for several moments before Theo reappeared and waved them over.‘Had to check it wasn’t guarded.’ Theo shrugged leading the way behind the towering rocks. Ayda’s eyebrow raised as she saw Niall and Karl leaning casually against the rock, swigging from his hip flask. Behind him was a small rough tunnel entrance well hidden from the eye.‘How did you know this was here!?’ Ayda said, dumbstruck. Niall laughed, reattached his flask to his belt and led them down towards the tunnel mouth. The tunnel itself was a squeeze, single file behind Niall they all followed, tripping occasionally on loose rock and uneven ground and crouching beneath low ceilings. The bright white stone darkened slowly as they moved deeper into the tunnel, Ayda realised that very soon they wouldn’t even see each-other. She suggested they each place a hand on the person in front’s shoulder, she was then repulsed to realise she had to touch Niall, who was humming a tune. Theo behind her and Syren and Karl behind him, they tripped and meandered through the black tunnel of white stone.‘Are we going to get lost?’ Syren echoed through the darkness.‘No, thankfully there is only one way to go.’ Niall explained, who was using his hands to feel the wall as he stumbled on, with Ayda’s disgusted hand on his shoulder. More than once the party had to stop as someone tripped and fell, amidst cursing and bruised knees Ayda was getting fed up.‘Why didn’t you prepare a torch?’ She asked bitterly.‘Because you were in a rush.’ Niall replied shortly, he was no longer humming and Ayda could tell he too was aching from his most recent trip. Good, she thought. Thankfully after an age of hiking light pierced their eyes. Ayda squinted from the harshness but was relieved when fresh air and warmth filled her. Her feet found level ground as they left the tunnel. Her eyes adjusting, she looked quickly around. They were in a garden. Her friends were squinting, pausing as they took note of each other in a silent head count.‘Oh my – Ayda!’ Syren shouted in alarm looking over Ayda’s head in shock. Ayda spun around. What she saw brought her to her knees. She screamed loudly and unashamedly crying for her family – how could they have survived that? The others stood as still as the mountains as they attempted to make sense of the scene before them. A vast portion of the once proud White Castle had collapsed. The Towers and parapets had crumpled into themselves and the walls of her home had crashed to the ground, hidden beneath a thick layer of white stone dust. Bodies of soldiers, servants and lords were scattered or crushed beneath the centuries old stone. Ayda could hear the ghost of the crashing collapse of her grand home amidst the eerie silence of destruction. She could distantly hear the agonizing screams and shrieks from the people unlucky enough to be trampled by the cascading stone. The Stone Castle had fallen way before she had arrived home, yet she imagined and felt every ounce of pain as the great symbol of protection fell to its knees in defeat. Her home was gone, what had happened to her family? As though on fire, Ayda launched herself forward. She could see that the Throne room and Grand Halls were just standing, fragile and leaning on the verge of collapse, the rest of the Castle was sand and dust. Leaving the other’s behind she hurled herself through the gardens jumping over rubble and ignoring the sounds of the dying. She HAD to get her sister! Distantly someone was calling her name, she climbed the white stone steps, skipping over more debris crumbling from the remnants of her home. “Elle!” She shouted repeatedly. She did not care who could hear her, from her eyes all that was left was pain and death, there was nothing here she could be bothered to fear. Her sister was her lifeline and her courage. Someone grabbed her roughly from behind and pulled her to the floor.‘Get off me!’ She snarled, kicking out she winded her assailant before crawling back up the steps.‘Ayda stop!’ He shouted. She recognised the voice.‘Help me Niall!’ She shouted desperately as she floundered up the dusty steps in such a hurry her feet could hardly keep up. She felt him push her as she regained her footing and propelled her forward with him running to keep up. She reached the Grand Hall, the beautiful masonry of the walls was crumbling, and the stone floors were veined with slits and cracks. The ornate tables were crushed beneath parts of ceiling and several statues of ancestors had been unceremoniously decapitated or flattened. Slower and more cautiously, Ayda and Niall moved through the Grand Hall, the large oak doors at the top of the rooms were off their hinges as the doorway had started to waiver. Climbing over the doors together they entered the Throne room. Ayda gasped as Niall cursed. Tens of Golden Clad soldiers were littered along the floor. Some had been impaled and some had shared the same fate as the Castle. Ayda’s eyes brimmed with tears as she saw her parent’s thrones standing, untouched and glistening against the odds. The chink of stone on stone fell like the pitter patter of rain, as portions of the last bones of the Castle began to fail. She heard a quiet sob. A childlike sob. Casting around she took in every detail of the room she had feared the most. Her heart burned with a heat so intense as she saw the blonde curly hair of her little sister.‘Elle!’ She cried loudly in relief. She bounded over to her sister with Niall just behind. ‘Oh Elle! I’ve been so –’ She stopped. Brielle looked up with her big puffy red eyes revealing the body she was clinging onto with every grain of strength she had.Their Father.The relief she felt at finding her sister was smothered by the sorrow that now shrouded her heart in ice. Her Father’s eyes were closed, his face peaceful. Reaching out, Ayda gently removed dust from his cold, lined complexion and pressed her lips to his forehead, vaguely aware of Niall lingering a polite distance away and the continual rain of stone around them. Death surrounded them on all sides, she knew they could not stay here, but she was content to stay trapped in this moment, as she knew with all her heart this would be the last time she would see her father’s kind face, the last time she would feel his fingers entwined with hers. He was cold, Elle was not. She had to get her sister to safety. Her Father would thank her for that. She pulled hard at Elle and tugged her away from the fallen King,‘Come on Elle, we need to go.’ She said softly, a lump catching in her throat, ‘Leave him, we cannot help him.’ Hearing crumbling stone, Ayda wasted no time in heaving the weeping Princess away. Ayda could not believe how easy it was to walk away from her Father, but she knew that Brielle was now her only priority, she had promised her Father to protect her, he would be urging them to leave this death trap. Niall led the way out from the ruins in silence, time seemed to freeze as the walls continued to crumble and groan. Not daring to look back at their home the Princesses climbed the Castle rubble and returned to their friends in the Gardens.‘Any trouble?’ Karl asked gruffly as they approached. Niall shook his head solemnly and moved towards the tunnel entrance without stopping. Following his lead, the others followed on in silence. Ensuring Elle was safely following Syren, Ayda braved one last look at her childhood home. Glancing around she shed a tear as the Castle groaned a relieved farewell as it slid to the ground in a cloud of white dust, no longer straining to protect those who had grown up in its safety.The walk back to the horses was a long and quiet one. After Niall had briefly explained to the other’s what had happened, no-one felt much like talking. The loss of a King was a shock, but the loss of a Father felt like a death sentence. Their Father was dead, and from what she had seen, she doubted her Mother was alive. Ayda grieved for them, for she now shouldered their responsibility. She had to find out who was responsible for the attack on her family and she had to protect Elle. Ayda looked down at the young girl, clutching at her arm. Her blonde hair was messy, her nightdress dirty and torn and her face blotchy and red, Brielle was never going to be the same carefree little Princess she was before. As they reached the horses, Ayda took the reins of hers and Syren’s mounts and pressed them into Niall’s hands. Their deal was complete.‘Thank you for all that you have done for us.’ She said quietly, not able to look him in the eye. Why was it that whenever death touched her life, he was always close by? She could not look at him, she was afraid that she would see the eyes of those she had lost.‘Where are you going now?’ He asked.‘North, up to the Wastes. I need to keep Elle away from here. I cannot lose her too.’ Niall looked over his shoulder towards Theo and Karl, who returned his look with a nod each, they mounted their horses and readied themselves. Niall placed the reins back into Ayda’s hands.‘You won’t get far without these, it’s a long way.’ Niall said with a slight smile as Ayda met his understanding eyes. He had known loss himself, he lived with the emptiness she saw. For the first time she found herself wondering what happened to the boy she had left behind, what had happened to his Pa? With a slight pang of guilt, she remembered that after all the past years she had forgotten her saviour’s name. Niall lowered himself, so he was face to face with Elle. He held out his hand and took her palm in his.‘Your Highness, if you are agreeable, my brothers and I would like to join your Guard, until it is safe to leave your side.’ He said pleasantly. Brielle watched the stranger closely, taking in every feature of his face. She looked up at her sister with wide eyes and moved closer‘Why are humans in Myrliar?’ Elle whispered to her sister. Ayda winced at her words, she knew that Syren would prefer their human counterpart’s dead, or at least banished, but Ayda found that a part of her trusted them, despite their differences.‘They saved my life, Elle, and helped me get to you.’ Ayda replied calmly. Syren moved forwards.‘We don’t need them anymore Ayda, we have Princess Brielle.’ She said stiffly. Ayda regarded her friend. Syren was a fierce young warrior, she had trained with Ayda since they were young elves. Her vibrant red hair was plaited messily after the recent rains, her stance glistened of confidence and skill, with her blade at her waist and her glistening greaves and vambraces. Syren wore minimal armour, she hated how heavy it was, and Ayda could not deny that her friend was quick for it (she had taken many sharp jabs from her during sparring).‘That’s the gratitude we get for saving your lives?’ Karl snarled at her.‘I believe the attack on us benefitted YOU greatly!’ Syren replied hotly, her voice rising.Ayda watched her comrade with admiration. Syren was almost half the size of Karl, who was a beast of a man. His huge arms and shoulders were built for sheer strength he looked capable of crushing Syren with his bare fist, if he could catch her first. Syren look unaffected as she stood her ground before him.‘We should go back Niall, Elves will always be Elves.’ Karl dismissed walking away from Syren. Niall looked at the little Princess who was watching with round eyes, and then turned to Ayda. He looked at her miserably.‘Is that what you want?’ He asked softly. Ayda looked to her friend apologetically, she hoped she would forgive her.‘All I want is to protect Elle, I have lost everyone I love, she is my life now. She is the future.’ Ayda began seriously, ‘If you swear to help me protect her, then you are most welcome.’‘But they are HUMAN Ayda!’ Syren repeated, aghast.‘Yes Syren, they are human. Our sworn enemies. But who has murdered my family? I see no human hand behind this.’ Ayda reasoned with her friend calmly. Syren backed down. Ayda knew they were both stung and hurt by the betrayal of their own comrades and had no way of defending them. They had to find out why her family had been overthrown by their own Army, she had to know why she had lost her parents and her home. She could only thank the Elders that her young sister was beside her, she was never going to let her go. Syren mounted her horse in silence and moved forwards with a nod to Ayda, who was already comforting Elle and helping her into the saddle before climbing up behind her. Niall clapped his hands together in eagerness and vaulted on to his saddle, patting Karl on the shoulder as he passed. Karl, still scowling, followed on behind Theo’s horse, positively glaring at the red head in front. Ayda sighed, this was not going to be an easy alliance. As the sun began to disappear behind the Pearl Mountains, the horses trudged on through the quiet forest, north past the Stone City. The occasional patter of water droplets on leaves could be heard as a gentle breeze whispered through the trees. Ayda had decided they should proceed at a steady pace for now, as the horses had been riding hard throughout the day and they had no knowledge as to the whereabout of their enemies. The elf did not want to lead them headlong into an army on exhausted mounts. Ayda had to admit even she was tired. The allies had not stopped for breath since the attack on Ayda and had rushed to save her family. Silence had blanketed each of them, too tired, too weary and too agitated to talk. Syren was still leading from the front, determined in her anger at being made to work alongside humans, she had not spoken a word since they mounted their steeds. Weakness had overwhelmed the older Princess. The darkness of the night was a bright light compared to the shadow over her heart. She could not shake the memory of her father, pale and cold in her poor sister’s arms. She longed to speak to Elle, to ask her what had happened, but she feared she should not interrogate her so soon. She was so fragile, she was like a small and intricate ice sculpture that she dared not hold for fear but could not bear to set aside defencelessly. She was sure that Elle would talk to her. Eventually.‘We must camp.’ Theo announced, making Ayda jump slightly. She turned in her horse to look at them. There was no sound of hooves on dirt, no whinnying, they had stopped all around her and, yet she could hardly see them.‘Theo’s right, if we continue in this dark we risk laming our horses.’ Niall agreed. She heard him moan as he dismounted and a moment later his boots hit the ground with a squelch. The other’s murmured their assent. Ayda did not much like the idea of stopping, she had hoped to distance themselves from the Stone City, but they had not even reached the edge of the forest.‘Ayda, the soldiers in that Castle were dead, I don’t think we have anything to fear this night.’ Niall reasoned, his hand appeared from the darkness to help lower Elle to the ground.‘They will return.’ Ayda said firmly, her legs aching she clambered off the horse.‘They will likely regroup first before returning, and they will not want to travel in this. We will move north again as soon as we can see where we’re walking.’ Niall said patiently. Ayda hesitated, she wanted to move Elle on.‘Ayda, they think they have Elle trapped in there. The City is on lock down and no-one’s seen her leave. We have some time to rest.’ Syren said tiredly. Ayda turned around and saw a roaring fire had already been lit, the warmth of the fire swept over her cold, damp and aching body like a wave, leaving the tips of her fingers tingling with pleasure. The crackling fire persuaded her. Her comrades had moved closer to it and were warming themselves peacefully by the flames. The ground surrounding the fire quickly dried out and she found herself grateful for the shelter the thick trees provided. Slowly each of them settled down to relax by the fire. Ayda unravelled some of the belongings from her horse and was relieved to find the previous rider had provided them with a few essentials. After drying out some blankets by the fire, Ayda set about making a place for her sister to rest. Theo had disappeared for a short while after stopping and had returned with a couple of hares which he then prepared and cooked on the fire. Everyone had eaten quietly except for Elle, who refused. Elle had been sat by the fire, staring into the dark abyss around them and not talking to anyone, occasionally panicking when Ayda left them to find something amongst the trees. Niall and Theo however seemed to have a career in conversation, they led a constant stream of jovial chatter which seemed to have common themes of ale, women and trouble. Although Karl did not join in the chatter, whenever his name was brought into the story he soon grumbled something about ‘exaggerating’ or ‘stupid’ or whatever name he thought Niall suited most at that moment in the story. Niall found the insults amusing and chuckled to himself whenever Karl offered a new one. They had a strong bond, Ayda could see that, they had grown up together and joined the Fiends together. They were brothers in life if not by blood. Ayda called Elle over to her. The young elf rose obediently from her place by the fire and settled in with the leaves and blankets of her make shift bed.‘When you want to talk to me, you can.’ Ayda whispered to her, stroking her sister’s long curls. ‘But rest for now, we have a long way to go.’ Elle closed her eyes to give the illusion of sleep, Ayda knew she was not likely to get any sleep tonight, they had lost their Father, Mother and Home in less than a day. They had also lost the love of their country. Nothing in their upbringing prepared them for this and now they were blind in the dark, surrounded by humans they hardly knew except for some distant childhood memory. Ayda had no idea what to do. She needed answers and Elle could give her them. Her patience was running thin and the responsibility was bearing down on her. Standing, she re-joined the others by the fire ensuring she was facing the exact spot her sister lay.‘What is the plan when we get to the wastes?’ Niall asked quietly, his eyes on Ayda.Ayda shook her head, ‘I don’t know. I just want her away from here.’‘Is that for the best? All the Guards in the Castle were dead, someone must have helped her, and how was that Castle brought down?’ Niall pointed out. She hadn’t thought of that. If she and Elle were so alone how on earth did fifty or so Guards die in that Castle and who did destroy the Castle? Elle certainly wasn’t capable of that.‘Elle told me something the other night, something happened to her during the Ritual.’ Ayda replied.‘During the Ritual? Was she spoken to?!’ Syren said excitedly.‘I think so, she just said she was scared. I didn’t really understand what she’d fear.’ Ayda shrugged looking at Syren. Niall, Theo and Karl looked confused.‘Excuse me, but what the hell is the Ritual?’ Niall asked, looking at them with interest.‘Did she say why she was scared? Do you have any ideas?’ Syren asked Ayda, ignoring him.‘She wanted to tell me, I know she did, but my Father warned her not to, I think.’ Ayda rubbed her temple trying to remember every detail of the night. She was so exhausted, her legs and back aching from riding.‘I can’t believe the Elders spoke to her. Her first Ritual.’ Syren said quietly in disbelief.‘WHAT IS THE RITUAL?’ Niall snapped, looking at them furiously.‘Like we’d tell –’ Syren snapped back, but Ayda had already began explaining.‘The Ritual is a tradition in Myrliar. For centuries our Elders select those of us they deem worthy and summon them to the Ritual.’‘Why?’ Niall asked, still glaring at Syren.‘Those who receive summons meet in the Ritual Chamber beneath the Castle as a way of respect. It is a great honour.’ Ayda finished.‘That’s stupid.’ Niall grunted, disappointed. Karl laughed.‘It’s not stupid!’ Ayda sparked up, ‘My Mother, Father and Elle were all summoned to commune with the Elders!”‘Not you?’ Niall pointed out quickly. Damn him, Ayda thought angrily.‘No, not me.’ Ayda said more to herself than anyone else.‘That’s why it’s stupid. You’re the eldest Princess, the Heir to the Throne and yet they summon Elle and not you? Why? What have you done?’ Niall accused. It hurt. Ayda stood up, she was wrong to have trusted these humans with this knowledge she should have kept it to herself. They were never going to understand the importance of their ways. He had asked her the question she had punished herself with for years and she was not telling anyone that answer. That was her pain, her mistake and her regret.‘She doesn’t need to explain herself to a human!’ Syren spat angrily, standing up in Ayda’s defence.‘And what actually happens in this chamber?!’ Niall continued ignoring Syren.‘We don’t know – we don’t go in do we?’ Syren hissed. Ayda ignored him, her heart aching under the heavy strain of loss and emptiness, she curled up next to Elle and listened whilst Syren and Niall continued to bicker until Theo stepped in to end it. Ayda watched her young sister and wondered how much she had heard, she looked as though she was contentedly sleeping, but she knew better, neither of them would sleep well tonight.She was running, she had never run so fast in her life. Niall was there running with her, Syren ahead of her with Theo and Karl behind. They were screaming for Elle. Elle? She thought desperately, where are you? No?! Ayda was shouting with them and running, her legs were screaming with pain, but she ignored them she had to find Elle. Elle! She called desperately, hysteria rising. Her friends were now running of into the distance, her body cried out as she pushed herself to catch up. She heard cries of pain and shouts ahead, her friends needed her! She was running so fast now, she couldn’t see them, she called their names whilst still searching for Elle. Her breathing was harsh and quick, panic was setting in. She stopped, spinning around on the spot she cried out desperately. It was going to catch her, she could hear it behind her, approaching fast. Where were they?! She screamed as something tapped her on the shoulder, she spun around and saw Elle stood there, blood down the front of her nightdress.‘I’m sorry Ayda.’ She cried, tears running down her face, ‘it’s all my fault!’. Ayda felt a jolt and someone calling her name, Theo? She looked around for him, turning back, Brielle had disappeared, she opened her eyes.‘Sorry Ayda, you were being quite loud, but we need to get going now.’ Theo said kindly as he gently shook her awake. Her heart was hammering against her ribs and her breathing was shallow. She sighed, she knew she wasn’t going to get a good couple of hours sleep and they had a long day ahead of them, she didn’t need nightmares disturbing her sleeping moments and her thoughts haunting her when awake. Rubbing her eyes, she began to pack up the blankets, attaching the previous owners’ saddlebag she spotted Elle with the horses.‘Morning,’ She greeted her sister.‘Ayda I –’ Elle began.‘Good Morning! I have brought you some clean clothes!’ Niall announced, oblivious to the interruption. ‘Well not new, I have borrowed them for our good cause.’ He chuckled to himself as he held up some cream linen tunic and green trousers for Elle. He grinned broadly, clearly pleased with himself for finding them. Elle took the clothes from him with a small ‘thanks’ and disappeared to change.‘Great. Just great.’ Ayda uttered.‘What?’ Niall said aghast, ‘What have I done now?’‘She was about to talk to me!’ Ayda replied angrily.‘I – I’m sorry! I didn’t realise!’ He spluttered, ‘I just wanted to help!’‘Don’t you always!’ Ayda hissed before storming back to the camp to check on everyone.That stupid man, she thought. Elle could have been about to tell her something important, an answer to a question and he interrupted. And for what? Some farm boy’s outfit? She caught sight of Elle with Syren, who was plaiting her hair in a similar fashion to her own, so it wasn’t in the way. Ayda walked over to them. Elle looked up at her. She looked lost, lost in her own thoughts and memories. No doubt haunted by the events that have terrified her. Ayda could see she was going to need more time than they had.‘Elle, what happened yesterday?’ Ayda asked softly, taking her hand and leading her over to their horse. The Princess looked up at her and shook her head.‘I’m scared Ayda, you should have left me there.’ Elle whispered sadly. Solemnly, without another word Elle mounted the horse without help and waited for Ayda to climb on behind her. Once everyone was seated they moved.‘I would never have left you there.’ Ayda said firmly into Brielle’s ear. Brielle said nothing further, she sighed and gazed ahead. The companions pressed forwards. The sun was not yet up but they could see. Theo and Karl had gone to great efforts to ensure that the camp and fire were cleared and that there was nothing remaining to track. Ayda could only hope it was enough. The night’s rest had done its job. The horses were refreshed, and the riders were stronger and more cheerful. Niall and his friends were continuing their long prose, Ayda found it surprising how much the three of them had to discuss. Ayda and Elle however, were not much changed. Brielle was still silent, apparently Niall and Theo’s jokes and games were not enough to bring her out of her stupor which was not surprising as Syren found them downright annoying.‘Are we really going to have to put up with them?’ Syren muttered to Ayda in passing, ducking as Niall attempted to poke her with a stick aimed for her cheek.‘With the rest of you all miserable it’s our duty to provide some relief!’ Niall said mockingly, poking Theo in the arm with his treasured stick and winking at Elle. Ayda had to admit, watching the men chasing each other with sticks and occasionally racing and play jousting was quite amusing. She appreciated the gesture. At first, she was as annoyed as Syren, but she realised they were acting up to try and ease Elle out of her despair. A few times Niall and Theo attempted to get Elle involved by poking her or asking for her favours before ‘battle’, Elle participated, but begrudgingly. The journey through the forest was uneventful, Ayda found herself treasuring the moments of peace knowing that they were surely not meant to last. Watching Niall and Theo had loosened the weights around her heart and she felt lighter, more hopeful, but she could not rid herself of the nagging worry clinging onto her with sharp claws. Elle still had not stirred, the little Princess at the Castle would have revelled in the games of these two Fiends, but she seemed uninterested. Ayda knew that whatever her concerns were, Elle was hiding something dark, deep within her soul and she had to help her, she had to share the burden that was eating away at her childhood. At last, by late morning they reached the edge of the forest. Ahead of them were lush green fields spread miles ahead of them, canvassing the land all around them. Niall let out a long whistle.‘It’s going to be hard to hide out there.’ He said.‘Well what do you suggest? There’s no other way to the wastes.’ Ayda replied.‘The River Myr?’ Theo asked, looking to Karl.‘We could follow the River north, but it will take longer, and they will most likely be watching the bridges.’ Karl agreed, rubbing his chin. Ayda was perplexed, the Wastes had felt like the safest place because no one ever travelled there. There was no green, no water and it was almost uninhabitable except for a small abandoned village. Ayda had forgotten that the journey there was going to be difficult to make undetected. She had no idea who she could trust. Even the people who greeted her with such enthusiasm on their Royal Progress could now be her enemy, she had to be smart and find a way around. Looking over the landscape ahead of her she took in the beauty of her country. The edge of the forest was a top a slight hill, she was lucky to have the vantage of looking down and plotting a course. She spied several small white stone settlements spotted over the fields, they would need to avoid those. Finally, she came up with a plan.‘From here we can see miles around us,’ She said clearly, ‘I suggest we move from high ground to high ground, there are several small hillsides where we can scour the landscape for the safest route. We should be able to see an army or hunting party from these.’ She pointed out the mounds of earth she was aiming for. The other’s nodded.‘It seems like a plan where a lot could go wrong, but I don’t see another option.’ Niall responded thoughtfully.‘It’s the best we’ve got.’ Theo agreed.‘In that case, I’ll meet you at the first one.’ Syren said, turning her horse away.‘What do you mean? Where are you going?’ Ayda turned to face her.‘Right now, we are travelling blind, we have no idea where our enemies are, what they know or who they are,’ Syren replied, ‘I intend to find out.’‘How?’ Ayda asked, worried.‘Inns and Taverns are always the best place for gossip.’ Niall explained. Syren nodded in agreement.‘Can I come?’ Niall asked eagerly.‘No.’‘I won’t get in your way, I’d just, um… have a drink?’‘No. Even if I wanted you with me you’d only be killed on sight.’ Syren ended the conversation impatiently. Bidding farewell to the Princesses she rode down the hill, Ayda watched as she hid her blades and placed her hood over her hair and made in the direction of the closest Town. Please get back safely, Ayda prayed.‘I think she’s starting to like me,’ Niall said happily, ‘she wouldn’t have even considered me before, now she’s concerned for my wellbeing.’‘I don’t think that’s what she was getting at mate,’ Theo thumped Niall’s shoulder laughing. Karl shook his head smirking at them. Kicking her horse forward, Ayda led them on. Down the hillside they plodded away from the forest, out into the open, the sun was nearly at its peak, blazing warmth down upon them. Ayda couldn’t help feeling cold. She couldn’t help remembering the last time her closest friend disappeared to help her, only that time he didn’t return. She couldn’t even say or think of his name anymore. There were cuts born of guilt so deep in her heart they would never be removed. He had died for her. She desperately wished Syren wouldn’t join him. For miles around them, the fields were lush and green, wild flowers of all colours and sizes were blossoming in the sun, big ancient trees stood tall amidst saplings born years ago, branches and leaves from smaller trees straining to keep up. Ayda watched with her sister as hundreds of birds danced and pirouetted across the sky forming waves upon waves of wings glistening with the sun. On they rode, taking in the natural splendour of the fertile land around them. Even Niall and Theo were silent, soaking up the peace, relishing the warm afternoon sun on their cold faces. On they walked for the rest of the day, every so often one of the humans would leave them, circle back and then re-join the party to make sure they weren’t being followed. Ayda’s thoughts were with her friend, she hoped more than anything that Syren would return to her. She had lost too many loved ones, the dull ache of her parent’s death and the memory of her father’s lifeless body would haunt her for the rest of her life, she couldn’t bear to add Syren to the pain. They walked on all day with no problems or encounters, and as the sun began to set they were nearing the top of the view point they had decided to rest upon. There wasn’t as much cover as Ayda had hoped, finding a small cluster of trees she went about setting Elle’s bed whilst the others took advantage of the remaining light to scout the area and spot anyone approaching from the hillside.Slowly night took hold. It was a beautiful night, mild and clear. Excusing themselves from the conversation being held by Niall and Karl, Ayda and Elle lay on the soft grass watching the stars overhead. Ayda took comfort in the small pinpricks of light penetrating the deep black sea above them. They looked close but when she reached out to touch one they were out of reach. Ayda allowed her mind to wander as her little sister admired the moonlight that rained down on them. She had not had time to think in peace without the feeling of unease or ache from travelling in her muscles, the thoughts in her head were so jumbled and confusing, like little jigsaw pieces she hadn’t had time to fit into place. She decided to start at the beginning. The Ritual. What had scared Elle so much at the Ritual? She had been spoken to, Elle had told her that much, but she didn’t know what was said that scared her. Then there was the attack on her. Her own comrades and Soldiers who she had trained with and fought with so many times, had turned on her. Betrayed her family, killed her Father and presumably her Mother and somehow succeeded in bringing down a centuries old Castle? She needed to know who had given these orders and whose authority was so absolute it went against the King himself. Who wanted her family killed – and why? Ayda knew that her little sister could probably provide the answers to most – if not all the questions, but her silence had continued all day.Ayda turned her head to look at her sister’s face. She could see long streams of glistening tears running down the Princesses face and getting lost in her blonde hair. She squeezed her hand in comfort.‘Do you think Mother and Father are up there?’ Elle whispered softly in her small girlish voice. Ayda looked up at the stars again. Pointing at the brightest one she replied,‘They are the brightest stars and always watching us.’ Ayda smiled slightly, taking comfort in the star that shone so brightly, Ayda realised that she was now watching the star and could see her Father smiling down on them. Suddenly she felt stronger, more able to do what she needed to do. He was watching them, and he would protect them.‘He died for me.’ Elle whispered sadly, the star reflecting brightly in her watery gaze.‘What do you mean?’ Ayda replied, holding her breath.‘The bad man wanted me, but Father wouldn’t let him.’‘What bad man? Wanted you why?’ Ayda sat up quickly, breathing fast she gave Elle time to reply.‘He-he was wearing a red cloak and gold mask. He tried to kill me.’ Elle said feebly.‘The Legion?!’ Ayda exclaimed flabbergasted. The Legion were the Guards of the Elders. They were very rarely seen as they usually stayed with their Masters. In fact, Ayda could not recall a time anyone had ever seen them, her Father nor Mother had ever seen them, they were only known to people through the teachings of the Scholars, many thought them a myth. Why would they want to kill Brielle? Why would the Elder’s want to kill Brielle? If this was true, what chance did they have against the most elite soldiers and the only mages left in the world?‘Elle, what scared you at the Ritual?’ She asked calmly, it would not do to let Elle see how worried she was. Elle sat up and shook her head slowly.‘Father said –’‘Father’s dead. If I’m going to protect you, I need to know everything,’ Ayda said firmly. She felt guilty for the words and for the tears brimming in her young sister’s eyes, but the truth was the truth and she had to know what the Princess knew, their lives depended on finding out why they were being hunted.‘I heard a woman,’ Elle whispered almost inaudibly, as though keeping the secret from the air around them, ‘She told me to get out. She was scared.’‘This girl – she wasn’t an Elder?’ Ayda asked confused. Elle shook her head profusely. Great, Ayda thought, this didn’t answer any questions and just added to the list of things she didn’t know. So, who was the girl and why did she want to get Elle out of the Ritual Chamber, nothing made sense. The only connection she could see was the Elders, but she had no idea what to do about that, she couldn’t demand they speak with her. They both sat in silence, both trapped in their own thoughts. Both searching for answers to questions. Sometime after, Niall came and found them, and they returned to the camp and got ready for a rough night’s sleep.‘Did she tell you anything?’ Niall asked quietly after Ayda came back from settling Elle down for the night. Ayda started to answer when they heard a distinct crack of a twig. The four of them jumped up quickly, weapons drawn, Ayda’s eyes were straining to see ahead of them in the dark. Slowly and quietly they moved towards sleeping Elle.‘Who’s there?’ Niall asked loudly, even though he was trying his best to sound confident she could hear the nervous waiver in his voice.‘Stand down it’s only me.’ Replied a familiar voice. Syren had re-joined them. Ayda breathed a silent sigh of relief. She was back. She was safe. Well safer.‘How did you know where we were?’ Niall spat, cursing her for making him jump.‘I didn’t, I’ve been wandering this hilltop for a while, it was only when I heard you that I knew where you were.’ Syren said quietly.‘Did anyone follow you?’ Karl asked gruffly.‘No and I’m fine thank you for asking.’ Syren said impatiently. Ayda clapped her on the shoulder.‘Good to see you,’ Ayda said gently, ‘Any news?’ The five of them sat down again not far from Elle. Syren started rummaging around in a bag and pulled out a loaf of bread, some fruit and cold meats. The others groaned thanks as they tucked in to the meal. Ayda had only just noticed the ache of hunger in the pit of her stomach and went to give Elle some of the food before returning to the small but merry feast. They hadn’t eaten much all day, just occasional fruit they picked going through the fields.‘I took the liberty of getting some food for the journey, but we’ll have to ration it, I couldn’t take too much without arousing suspicion.’ Syren said through a mouthful of hard bread. They ate in silence, each relishing every mouthful until the food in front of them was devoured.‘The Stone City has fallen.’ Syren said bitterly. Ayda looked at her and waited for her to continue. ‘The attack on the Stone City is the talk of the village. It is rumoured that the Legion have pulled out everyone from their homes looking for Elle. There are also scouts searching for you.’‘What of my people?’ Ayda asked. She remembered the times when her family would go on progress through Myrliar, her people were always so happy to see them, they would throw flowers and sing songs of love and peace, she had forgotten that in this struggle for power, everyone would be affected.‘The Legion have turned people out on the streets and forbidden anyone to aid you. Some have come out to support you and have been flayed for it. Young girls have been taken from their parents and examined to make sure they’re not your sister. Families that resist or hinder any search are killed on the spot.’ Syren said all this quickly as if to rid herself of the taste of it on her tongue. Ayda could not bear to think of the families being torn apart and all the blood shed on the white stone floors of her City.‘Who oversees Myrliar now?’ Ayda asked with a heavy heart.‘The Captain of the Legion apparently.’ Syren replied.‘Why have they done this? Why have they overturned my family, ours was a reign of peace!’ Ayda fumed, her blood boiling, the injustice and terror of everything that had happened to her family and country were too much to bear, and she was still no closer to getting any answers.‘The Legion are controlled by the Elders you say?’ Niall asked quietly.‘Yes, they are sworn guardians of the Elders.’ Ayda nodded.‘And the Ritual connects you Elves with the Elders?’ He asked. Ayda nodded again, curious.‘So, if Elle was scared after the Ritual, maybe she saw something she wasn’t meant to?’ Niall suggested, palms open in offering.‘And the girl telling Elle to get out?’ Ayda asked hopefully. Syren’s confused face looked between them, and Ayda brought her up to speed on what Elle had shared.‘The girl warned her, she knew the Elders would find out?’ Niall said, unsure of his own thoughts. Ayda had come to the same theory in her mind. The secret seemed to lay with Elle, but she was sure her sister had now told her everything.‘How on earth did someone communicate with Elle telepathically?’ Syren asked, bewildered.Ayda had been asking herself the same question. She had heard of this skill before, but no one had the power to do it for centuries.‘Magic.’ Came a quiet voice, Elle had woken and sat next to them without anyone realising.‘Impossible.’ Ayda said rather too quickly, slightly concerned that the young girl had gotten to them without any of them hearing anything.Niall laughed, ‘Magic? Are you serious?’‘You humans have never had magic?’ Syren asked curiously.‘No, never.’ Theo snorted, unsure whether it was a joke.‘Elves and Humans possessed powerful magic thousands of years ago, but through blood lines over time, it dwindled out, no one has ever seen, possessed or practised magic in centuries,’ Ayda told them, ‘We were brought up on history over the years, mages were present on both sides in the Great War that engulfed our people.’‘The Ritual is believed to be a chance for Elves to regain their magic and knowledge through communing with the Elders.’ Elle added, Syren was shaking her head at Ayda, she still didn’t trust the humans with the secrets of Myrliar. In the distance a howl could be heard, ghost like and clear as the stars above. It didn’t sound very close, so the companions took it as a cue to get some rest, with Karl on first watch. Ayda curled up once again around her sister, ready for fitful sleep.‘Ayda, Ayda...’Ayda shrugged off the hands that were annoying her, she couldn’t have been asleep that long. Just a little longer, there was another day of travelling ahead and she was still aching from the day before.She drifted back off to sleep. A sharp pain in the leg woke her and she cried out loud as she awoke.‘What the hell –’ She began to shout, but someone put a hand over her mouth, she struggled against them, not being completely awake she panicked, until she saw Elle just in front of her urging her to quiet down.‘Will you shut up?’ Niall spat in her ear. She nodded furiously, and he let her go.‘The howling is closer, we think the wolves are near our campsite.’ Syren explained coolly. Ayda sighed, there goes their night’s rest.‘Elle get up a tree, will you?’ Ayda said to her sister pointing at the closest one.‘Good idea. Princess, go on.’ Theo pushed her gently. With some help from the other’s Elle managed to shimmy up the tree and behind the leaves, out of sight. Ayda relaxed a little, the wolves would never get her up there, shame they weren’t built for more people. The howling sent goosebumps up her back. The hairs all over her body stood tall and alert. She was very aware of the sudden drop in temperature, as her lungs filled with ice and her breath caught in her chest. Ayda saw the others in front of her, circling her with their weapons raised. Karl with his broadsword stood like a giant over the others, Theo and Syren with their twin swords poised and Niall with his sword loosely at his side. Ayda unsheathed her own sword, she had taken down wolves before on Patrol, this shouldn’t be too difficult she reasoned calming herself. Unless there’s too many. The howling grew closer, they were nearly upon them. Something didn’t feel right, Ayda thought, the other’s in front were nervously looking around, their breath fogging in the moonlight. They had all encountered wolves before, but the growl of these wolves was, ghostly. A gritty, rough growling sounded all around them, glass twinkling through the dark.They were here. Ayda prepared her sword, and held it outstretched in front of her as the wolves ripped through the undergrowth. Several of her allies cursed loudly as they saw what was tearing towards them. A flash of silver fur and red eyes approached as wolves the size of lions hurtled towards them, growling in anticipation. Ayda watched in horror as one of the monsters leapt at her red-haired friend, who neatly rolled over to slice its underbelly as it flew overhead. Ayda had to admire her friend’s skill. The wolf, though hurt, did not stop there, it flew at her snapping at her as Syren pummelled it repeatedly with her blades. These were not normal wolves Ayda realised. Their silver fur was glowing in the moonlight and their red eyes were filled with an all-consuming bloodlust. Ayda jumped in to stab the monster repeatedly, together Ayda and Syren finished it off, just as another appeared growling. Ayda turned and saw four wolves attacking the humans. Niall, Theo and Karl were impressive, each one fluent in their dance, each of them understanding the other, when one struck, the other defended. As Karl landed a killing blow across the throat of a monster, Niall smacked another in the head to block its attack. The wolves were strong, and had razor sharp teeth and claws, but they were slow, they had to use this to their advantage. On and on they fought together, the five of them huddled as close together as possible, their resolve frightening, as they roared louder than the wolves. More and more wolves approached.‘We – can’t – keep this – going – forever!’ Syren screamed breathlessly as she slid her blade into the roof of a wolf’s mouth. ‘Aargh!’ She cried with pain, Ayda looked around and saw blood seeping from a fresh slice in her friend’s arm. The allies were all sporting their own cuts and wounds, they were slowly being ripped apart, and they would not last much longer before they tired from the onslaught of monsters. A thud on the ground shook her as she watched Theo fall backwards crying in pain, clutching his leg, Ayda saw a nasty bite mark shedding blood beneath his linens, he cursed loudly. Niall hacked off the wolf’s head with several blows, spilling blackened blood on the ground before returning with Karl to defend their brother. Time was running out, they were one down, Ayda was sure soon others would fall. Jumping aside Ayda timed a perfect hit as she slashed the side of a wolf. Too late, she realised she had pushed herself into the path of another that had thrown itself at her. Her chest felt as though it had been crushed under a pile of rock, claws were digging into her shoulders as the beast pressed her into the ground. Its teeth were mere inches from her skin gnashing together waiting for the taste of her blood. Using all her strength she pushed the wolf away from her, it was no use, it was too strong.‘Ayda!’ Niall bellowed. She heard the shouts of her friends around her, daring a look she could see they would never get to her in time, they were still struggling with their own beasts. She pushed with all her remaining strength, struggling to keep the teeth from her throat, the wolf thrashing around snapping its jaws angrily. Struggling she realised she was losing. A high-pitched shriek sounded across the hill. The world around her flashed a brilliant red and yellow, as flames scorched the air, Ayda strained a look above her. What she saw stopped her heart. Elle had climbed down from the tree to aid them, her arms were stretched wide and strings of flames were firing from her hands, white hot and blazing, snaking their way around the wolves before her. One by one the wolves howled in pain. The smell of burning flesh reached Ayda as the flames burnt holes like snakes through their bodies. Some fled but did not get far before Elle’s flames torched them into ash. Ayda wept as she watched her little sister’s face, grim determination was sketched across every feature. Her eyes were black and strained. She looked older, so much older. The wolf bearing down on Ayda burned internally and collapsed onto Ayda, who with her last breath looked at Elle and realised with shock, her sister was a Mage.",

      "content": "7– AYDAThe storm had taken its toll on them. Ayda’s cloak was soaked through and clinging to her frame, water running off the light armour beneath. Syren’s red hair was darkened with water and stuck flat to her body. Their horses were broken, exhausted from the hard ride through the dense forest that surrounded the First Wall of Myrliar. The wall was now visible, the storm had finally cleared as quickly as it had raged. The rain and winds had been heavy when she had left Niall, but that storm had turned deadly and angry almost instantly, as if the Elder’s themselves had conjured it. The clouds had thundered in black and dark, haunting the world. Ayda had not slowed despite the danger, she was desperate to get her little sister to safety. The treachery of her comrades clung painfully at her heart, she would mourn their friendship later, for now, she had to get to Elle.‘We can’t just walk into the City, someone clearly wants you dead.” Syren said quietly to Ayda.‘We have to find a way in and quickly,’ Ayda insisted, attempting to hide the panic in her voice, she could not bear to think what could be happening to her family, they could already be dead. No, she thought, I cannot think like that. Hiding their weak horses in the brush, Ayda and Syren slowly approached the First Wall, hiding behind a cluster of trees, they scoured the wall. The Wall towered above the ancient trees of the forest. Small, iron barred windows were dotted along it, figures of Guards and Soldiers could be seen moving from window to window carrying out their daily duties. Ayda was grateful for her training, as a Soldier of the Golden Army she knew the First Wall and the Barracks within very well. If they were careful maybe they could sneak through unnoticed.‘They’ve closed the gates!’ Syren whispered urgently. Ayda’s eyes snapped to the entrance of the Wall, the huge stone and steel gates were down and sealed, shielding Myrliar from any unwanted visitors. Ayda sighed, the situation had gone from difficult to impossible. The gates of the First Wall were only ever closed at time of war with the Humans, in her lifetime, she could not remember them being sealed once. Were they keeping her out, or her family in?‘What do we do?’ Syren asked, still crouching low behind the trees next to her. Ayda looked around helplessly for inspiration, she felt the panic rising, she had no idea how they could penetrate a wall that an Army could not bring down. She considered scaling it, but the white stone was so smooth they were not going to get a foothold. ‘I could always try to sneak in, the Guards are looking for you not me.’ Syren suggested. The thought had occurred to Ayda, but she had no idea how her friend would explain being without the Patrol, they must know they were close sparring partners. It was too dangerous. She relayed these thoughts to the red-haired elf.‘So, we can’t climb, dig or walk in.’ Syren muttered, kicking the dirt in frustration. Ayda ignored her friend. A sickness had crept to her stomach and was threatening to pull her on all fours. Her little sister was so far away from her. Ayda had been able to fight her way out with help from her friends, but Elle was so small, so weak, she would stand no chance of getting away from the Army. Then there were her parents, the King and Queen of Myrliar. Had they lost power? Had someone risen and removed them from their Throne? Was anyone in that Castle fighting for them? Ayda felt helpless, she had ridden hard against the ferocious storm to help her family, but she was still no nearer to holding her little sister. Syren, spotting the look of defeat on Ayda’s face moved forwards.‘I’m sure she is safe, no-one could deem your sister a threat, Sir Rakel or Sir Morcei would have got them out, I’m sure of it.’ At the mention of Sir Rakel, a spark ignited, fighting the deep despair in which she had begun to drown. He was a lifelong friend of her Father, no matter what, he would be standing with her family. She smiled weakly at her comrade.‘I thought you two would be in and out by now!’ Someone called to them close by. Three men climbed through the thicket towards them. The leader walked lazily, swinging his arms with a carefree look on his face. The two men behind looked much less at ease, both with their hands firmly around the hilt of their favourite blade.‘What are you doing here?’ Ayda spat at Niall.‘That is not nice.’ Niall jested, ‘I thought Princesses were supposed to have manners.’ He dipped quickly into a bow with a smile on his face, the handsome young man to his left smirked.Niall clapped his hands together carelessly. ‘So, what’s the plan your Highness?’‘What?’ Ayda asked confused.‘How are we getting in there to get the little Elf?’ Theo asked enthusiastically from Niall’s left. Ayda blushed, embarrassed. She had no plan. She had absolutely no idea how to get into her own home. Niall laughed loudly. Karl smacked him on the back with a firm ‘Quiet!’ which silenced him momentarily. ‘The Princess doesn’t know her own home Karl – it’s funny.’‘What are you going on about?! Do YOU know how to get in? You’ve never even been here before.’ Ayda spat angrily at him for mocking her. Niall shrugged.‘Here’s the deal. I’ll get you in that Castle, get your little Princess and then we take our horses back.’ Niall said simply. Ayda felt a slight annoyance at the bargain. So, he had not come back to help her, he just wanted what was his.‘Fine.’ She snapped. Niall grabbed her hand and shook it so excessively, she knew he was playing with her. She was not in the mood for his games, she wanted to see her family so desperately she would do anything it took. Niall gestured for them to follow him. Ayda followed him and his friends at a slight distance, she heard him complaining to Karl about the smack he had received and rolled her eyes.‘Where do you think he’s taking us?’ Syren whispered to her as she walked close by.‘I have no idea. He seems to know where he’s going though.’ Ayda replied quietly.‘I think we should get rid of them. It’s the law, I don’t trust them.’ Syren said, her voice full of loathing. Ayda knew her friend would be distrustful of the humans, Syren didn’t have any kind memories of any that she had encountered, all she saw was pain and years of hate. Ayda looked at the young man prancing in front of her. Niall was certainly the boy she had met when she was a child. He was still naughty and mischievous, she was curious as to his sudden knowledge of Myrliar. Ayda had not been too happy to see him, memories of her old friend had resurfaced upon seeing his face, a past she wished would stay in the shadows where it belonged. How annoying that Niall should save her life not once – but twice! Niall continued leading the way, she knew they were following the outer wall round as the five of them traipsed through the forest surrounding the Stone City. They grew closer and closer to the Pearl Mountains.‘If you’re planning on climbing the Pearl Mountains to get to the Castle then stop. There are Patrols protecting the Castle from anyone attempting this.’ Ayda called to him. Niall ignored her and walked on. Furious at being ignored, she sped up to him.‘How can you possibly know where we’re going?’ She demanded.‘Do you want to stand here and talk, or do you want to get to your family?’ He said exasperated. She nodded, agreeing that the conversation could wait until she had Elle under her wing. Ayda was angry with him though, his whole demeanour angered her. Her family was ruined, and he was taking a daily stroll through the forest. How can he know more about this Castle than her? He was a stranger, and this was her home. The mountains were so close now, clusters of brilliant white boulders were dotted around the forest and against the First Wall. She felt no nearer to her sister. ‘You two wait here.’ Niall said without looking at them. He, Theo and Karl, swords raised wandered behind a group of rocks, larger than two homes and disappeared for several moments before Theo reappeared and waved them over.‘Had to check it wasn’t guarded.’ Theo shrugged leading the way behind the towering rocks. Ayda’s eyebrow raised as she saw Niall and Karl leaning casually against the rock, swigging from his hip flask. Behind him was a small rough tunnel entrance well hidden from the eye.‘How did you know this was here!?’ Ayda said, dumbstruck. Niall laughed, reattached his flask to his belt and led them down towards the tunnel mouth. The tunnel itself was a squeeze, single file behind Niall they all followed, tripping occasionally on loose rock and uneven ground and crouching beneath low ceilings. The bright white stone darkened slowly as they moved deeper into the tunnel, Ayda realised that very soon they wouldn’t even see each-other. She suggested they each place a hand on the person in front’s shoulder, she was then repulsed to realise she had to touch Niall, who was humming a tune. Theo behind her and Syren and Karl behind him, they tripped and meandered through the black tunnel of white stone.‘Are we going to get lost?’ Syren echoed through the darkness.‘No, thankfully there is only one way to go.’ Niall explained, who was using his hands to feel the wall as he stumbled on, with Ayda’s disgusted hand on his shoulder. More than once the party had to stop as someone tripped and fell, amidst cursing and bruised knees Ayda was getting fed up.‘Why didn’t you prepare a torch?’ She asked bitterly.‘Because you were in a rush.’ Niall replied shortly, he was no longer humming and Ayda could tell he too was aching from his most recent trip. Good, she thought. Thankfully after an age of hiking light pierced their eyes. Ayda squinted from the harshness but was relieved when fresh air and warmth filled her. Her feet found level ground as they left the tunnel. Her eyes adjusting, she looked quickly around. They were in a garden. Her friends were squinting, pausing as they took note of each other in a silent head count.‘Oh my – Ayda!’ Syren shouted in alarm looking over Ayda’s head in shock. Ayda spun around. What she saw brought her to her knees. She screamed loudly and unashamedly crying for her family – how could they have survived that? The others stood as still as the mountains as they attempted to make sense of the scene before them. A vast portion of the once proud White Castle had collapsed. The Towers and parapets had crumpled into themselves and the walls of her home had crashed to the ground, hidden beneath a thick layer of white stone dust. Bodies of soldiers, servants and lords were scattered or crushed beneath the centuries old stone. Ayda could hear the ghost of the crashing collapse of her grand home amidst the eerie silence of destruction. She could distantly hear the agonizing screams and shrieks from the people unlucky enough to be trampled by the cascading stone. The Stone Castle had fallen way before she had arrived home, yet she imagined and felt every ounce of pain as the great symbol of protection fell to its knees in defeat. Her home was gone, what had happened to her family? As though on fire, Ayda launched herself forward. She could see that the Throne room and Grand Halls were just standing, fragile and leaning on the verge of collapse, the rest of the Castle was sand and dust. Leaving the other’s behind she hurled herself through the gardens jumping over rubble and ignoring the sounds of the dying. She HAD to get her sister! Distantly someone was calling her name, she climbed the white stone steps, skipping over more debris crumbling from the remnants of her home. “Elle!” She shouted repeatedly. She did not care who could hear her, from her eyes all that was left was pain and death, there was nothing here she could be bothered to fear. Her sister was her lifeline and her courage. Someone grabbed her roughly from behind and pulled her to the floor.‘Get off me!’ She snarled, kicking out she winded her assailant before crawling back up the steps.‘Ayda stop!’ He shouted. She recognised the voice.‘Help me Niall!’ She shouted desperately as she floundered up the dusty steps in such a hurry her feet could hardly keep up. She felt him push her as she regained her footing and propelled her forward with him running to keep up. She reached the Grand Hall, the beautiful masonry of the walls was crumbling, and the stone floors were veined with slits and cracks. The ornate tables were crushed beneath parts of ceiling and several statues of ancestors had been unceremoniously decapitated or flattened. Slower and more cautiously, Ayda and Niall moved through the Grand Hall, the large oak doors at the top of the rooms were off their hinges as the doorway had started to waiver. Climbing over the doors together they entered the Throne room. Ayda gasped as Niall cursed. Tens of Golden Clad soldiers were littered along the floor. Some had been impaled and some had shared the same fate as the Castle. Ayda’s eyes brimmed with tears as she saw her parent’s thrones standing, untouched and glistening against the odds. The chink of stone on stone fell like the pitter patter of rain, as portions of the last bones of the Castle began to fail. She heard a quiet sob. A childlike sob. Casting around she took in every detail of the room she had feared the most. Her heart burned with a heat so intense as she saw the blonde curly hair of her little sister.‘Elle!’ She cried loudly in relief. She bounded over to her sister with Niall just behind. ‘Oh Elle! I’ve been so –’ She stopped. Brielle looked up with her big puffy red eyes revealing the body she was clinging onto with every grain of strength she had.Their Father.The relief she felt at finding her sister was smothered by the sorrow that now shrouded her heart in ice. Her Father’s eyes were closed, his face peaceful. Reaching out, Ayda gently removed dust from his cold, lined complexion and pressed her lips to his forehead, vaguely aware of Niall lingering a polite distance away and the continual rain of stone around them. Death surrounded them on all sides, she knew they could not stay here, but she was content to stay trapped in this moment, as she knew with all her heart this would be the last time she would see her father’s kind face, the last time she would feel his fingers entwined with hers. He was cold, Elle was not. She had to get her sister to safety. Her Father would thank her for that. She pulled hard at Elle and tugged her away from the fallen King,‘Come on Elle, we need to go.’ She said softly, a lump catching in her throat, ‘Leave him, we cannot help him.’ Hearing crumbling stone, Ayda wasted no time in heaving the weeping Princess away. Ayda could not believe how easy it was to walk away from her Father, but she knew that Brielle was now her only priority, she had promised her Father to protect her, he would be urging them to leave this death trap. Niall led the way out from the ruins in silence, time seemed to freeze as the walls continued to crumble and groan. Not daring to look back at their home the Princesses climbed the Castle rubble and returned to their friends in the Gardens.‘Any trouble?’ Karl asked gruffly as they approached. Niall shook his head solemnly and moved towards the tunnel entrance without stopping. Following his lead, the others followed on in silence. Ensuring Elle was safely following Syren, Ayda braved one last look at her childhood home. Glancing around she shed a tear as the Castle groaned a relieved farewell as it slid to the ground in a cloud of white dust, no longer straining to protect those who had grown up in its safety.The walk back to the horses was a long and quiet one. After Niall had briefly explained to the other’s what had happened, no-one felt much like talking. The loss of a King was a shock, but the loss of a Father felt like a death sentence. Their Father was dead, and from what she had seen, she doubted her Mother was alive. Ayda grieved for them, for she now shouldered their responsibility. She had to find out who was responsible for the attack on her family and she had to protect Elle. Ayda looked down at the young girl, clutching at her arm. Her blonde hair was messy, her nightdress dirty and torn and her face blotchy and red, Brielle was never going to be the same carefree little Princess she was before. As they reached the horses, Ayda took the reins of hers and Syren’s mounts and pressed them into Niall’s hands. Their deal was complete.‘Thank you for all that you have done for us.’ She said quietly, not able to look him in the eye. Why was it that whenever death touched her life, he was always close by? She could not look at him, she was afraid that she would see the eyes of those she had lost.‘Where are you going now?’ He asked.‘North, up to the Wastes. I need to keep Elle away from here. I cannot lose her too.’ Niall looked over his shoulder towards Theo and Karl, who returned his look with a nod each, they mounted their horses and readied themselves. Niall placed the reins back into Ayda’s hands.‘You won’t get far without these, it’s a long way.’ Niall said with a slight smile as Ayda met his understanding eyes. He had known loss himself, he lived with the emptiness she saw. For the first time she found herself wondering what happened to the boy she had left behind, what had happened to his Pa? With a slight pang of guilt, she remembered that after all the past years she had forgotten her saviour’s name. Niall lowered himself, so he was face to face with Elle. He held out his hand and took her palm in his.‘Your Highness, if you are agreeable, my brothers and I would like to join your Guard, until it is safe to leave your side.’ He said pleasantly. Brielle watched the stranger closely, taking in every feature of his face. She looked up at her sister with wide eyes and moved closer‘Why are humans in Myrliar?’ Elle whispered to her sister. Ayda winced at her words, she knew that Syren would prefer their human counterpart’s dead, or at least banished, but Ayda found that a part of her trusted them, despite their differences.‘They saved my life, Elle, and helped me get to you.’ Ayda replied calmly. Syren moved forwards.‘We don’t need them anymore Ayda, we have Princess Brielle.’ She said stiffly. Ayda regarded her friend. Syren was a fierce young warrior, she had trained with Ayda since they were young elves. Her vibrant red hair was plaited messily after the recent rains, her stance glistened of confidence and skill, with her blade at her waist and her glistening greaves and vambraces. Syren wore minimal armour, she hated how heavy it was, and Ayda could not deny that her friend was quick for it (she had taken many sharp jabs from her during sparring).‘That’s the gratitude we get for saving your lives?’ Karl snarled at her.‘I believe the attack on us benefitted YOU greatly!’ Syren replied hotly, her voice rising.Ayda watched her comrade with admiration. Syren was almost half the size of Karl, who was a beast of a man. His huge arms and shoulders were built for sheer strength he looked capable of crushing Syren with his bare fist, if he could catch her first. Syren look unaffected as she stood her ground before him.‘We should go back Niall, Elves will always be Elves.’ Karl dismissed walking away from Syren. Niall looked at the little Princess who was watching with round eyes, and then turned to Ayda. He looked at her miserably.‘Is that what you want?’ He asked softly. Ayda looked to her friend apologetically, she hoped she would forgive her.‘All I want is to protect Elle, I have lost everyone I love, she is my life now. She is the future.’ Ayda began seriously, ‘If you swear to help me protect her, then you are most welcome.’‘But they are HUMAN Ayda!’ Syren repeated, aghast.‘Yes Syren, they are human. Our sworn enemies. But who has murdered my family? I see no human hand behind this.’ Ayda reasoned with her friend calmly. Syren backed down. Ayda knew they were both stung and hurt by the betrayal of their own comrades and had no way of defending them. They had to find out why her family had been overthrown by their own Army, she had to know why she had lost her parents and her home. She could only thank the Elders that her young sister was beside her, she was never going to let her go. Syren mounted her horse in silence and moved forwards with a nod to Ayda, who was already comforting Elle and helping her into the saddle before climbing up behind her. Niall clapped his hands together in eagerness and vaulted on to his saddle, patting Karl on the shoulder as he passed. Karl, still scowling, followed on behind Theo’s horse, positively glaring at the red head in front. Ayda sighed, this was not going to be an easy alliance. As the sun began to disappear behind the Pearl Mountains, the horses trudged on through the quiet forest, north past the Stone City. The occasional patter of water droplets on leaves could be heard as a gentle breeze whispered through the trees. Ayda had decided they should proceed at a steady pace for now, as the horses had been riding hard throughout the day and they had no knowledge as to the whereabout of their enemies. The elf did not want to lead them headlong into an army on exhausted mounts. Ayda had to admit even she was tired. The allies had not stopped for breath since the attack on Ayda and had rushed to save her family. Silence had blanketed each of them, too tired, too weary and too agitated to talk. Syren was still leading from the front, determined in her anger at being made to work alongside humans, she had not spoken a word since they mounted their steeds. Weakness had overwhelmed the older Princess. The darkness of the night was a bright light compared to the shadow over her heart. She could not shake the memory of her father, pale and cold in her poor sister’s arms. She longed to speak to Elle, to ask her what had happened, but she feared she should not interrogate her so soon. She was so fragile, she was like a small and intricate ice sculpture that she dared not hold for fear but could not bear to set aside defencelessly. She was sure that Elle would talk to her. Eventually.‘We must camp.’ Theo announced, making Ayda jump slightly. She turned in her horse to look at them. There was no sound of hooves on dirt, no whinnying, they had stopped all around her and, yet she could hardly see them.‘Theo’s right, if we continue in this dark we risk laming our horses.’ Niall agreed. She heard him moan as he dismounted and a moment later his boots hit the ground with a squelch. The other’s murmured their assent. Ayda did not much like the idea of stopping, she had hoped to distance themselves from the Stone City, but they had not even reached the edge of the forest.‘Ayda, the soldiers in that Castle were dead, I don’t think we have anything to fear this night.’ Niall reasoned, his hand appeared from the darkness to help lower Elle to the ground.‘They will return.’ Ayda said firmly, her legs aching she clambered off the horse.‘They will likely regroup first before returning, and they will not want to travel in this. We will move north again as soon as we can see where we’re walking.’ Niall said patiently. Ayda hesitated, she wanted to move Elle on.‘Ayda, they think they have Elle trapped in there. The City is on lock down and no-one’s seen her leave. We have some time to rest.’ Syren said tiredly. Ayda turned around and saw a roaring fire had already been lit, the warmth of the fire swept over her cold, damp and aching body like a wave, leaving the tips of her fingers tingling with pleasure. The crackling fire persuaded her. Her comrades had moved closer to it and were warming themselves peacefully by the flames. The ground surrounding the fire quickly dried out and she found herself grateful for the shelter the thick trees provided. Slowly each of them settled down to relax by the fire. Ayda unravelled some of the belongings from her horse and was relieved to find the previous rider had provided them with a few essentials. After drying out some blankets by the fire, Ayda set about making a place for her sister to rest. Theo had disappeared for a short while after stopping and had returned with a couple of hares which he then prepared and cooked on the fire. Everyone had eaten quietly except for Elle, who refused. Elle had been sat by the fire, staring into the dark abyss around them and not talking to anyone, occasionally panicking when Ayda left them to find something amongst the trees. Niall and Theo however seemed to have a career in conversation, they led a constant stream of jovial chatter which seemed to have common themes of ale, women and trouble. Although Karl did not join in the chatter, whenever his name was brought into the story he soon grumbled something about ‘exaggerating’ or ‘stupid’ or whatever name he thought Niall suited most at that moment in the story. Niall found the insults amusing and chuckled to himself whenever Karl offered a new one. They had a strong bond, Ayda could see that, they had grown up together and joined the Fiends together. They were brothers in life if not by blood. Ayda called Elle over to her. The young elf rose obediently from her place by the fire and settled in with the leaves and blankets of her make shift bed.‘When you want to talk to me, you can.’ Ayda whispered to her, stroking her sister’s long curls. ‘But rest for now, we have a long way to go.’ Elle closed her eyes to give the illusion of sleep, Ayda knew she was not likely to get any sleep tonight, they had lost their Father, Mother and Home in less than a day. They had also lost the love of their country. Nothing in their upbringing prepared them for this and now they were blind in the dark, surrounded by humans they hardly knew except for some distant childhood memory. Ayda had no idea what to do. She needed answers and Elle could give her them. Her patience was running thin and the responsibility was bearing down on her. Standing, she re-joined the others by the fire ensuring she was facing the exact spot her sister lay.‘What is the plan when we get to the wastes?’ Niall asked quietly, his eyes on Ayda.Ayda shook her head, ‘I don’t know. I just want her away from here.’‘Is that for the best? All the Guards in the Castle were dead, someone must have helped her, and how was that Castle brought down?’ Niall pointed out. She hadn’t thought of that. If she and Elle were so alone how on earth did fifty or so Guards die in that Castle and who did destroy the Castle? Elle certainly wasn’t capable of that.‘Elle told me something the other night, something happened to her during the Ritual.’ Ayda replied.‘During the Ritual? Was she spoken to?!’ Syren said excitedly.‘I think so, she just said she was scared. I didn’t really understand what she’d fear.’ Ayda shrugged looking at Syren. Niall, Theo and Karl looked confused.‘Excuse me, but what the hell is the Ritual?’ Niall asked, looking at them with interest.‘Did she say why she was scared? Do you have any ideas?’ Syren asked Ayda, ignoring him.‘She wanted to tell me, I know she did, but my Father warned her not to, I think.’ Ayda rubbed her temple trying to remember every detail of the night. She was so exhausted, her legs and back aching from riding.‘I can’t believe the Elders spoke to her. Her first Ritual.’ Syren said quietly in disbelief.‘WHAT IS THE RITUAL?’ Niall snapped, looking at them furiously.‘Like we’d tell –’ Syren snapped back, but Ayda had already began explaining.‘The Ritual is a tradition in Myrliar. For centuries our Elders select those of us they deem worthy and summon them to the Ritual.’‘Why?’ Niall asked, still glaring at Syren.‘Those who receive summons meet in the Ritual Chamber beneath the Castle as a way of respect. It is a great honour.’ Ayda finished.‘That’s stupid.’ Niall grunted, disappointed. Karl laughed.‘It’s not stupid!’ Ayda sparked up, ‘My Mother, Father and Elle were all summoned to commune with the Elders!”‘Not you?’ Niall pointed out quickly. Damn him, Ayda thought angrily.‘No, not me.’ Ayda said more to herself than anyone else.‘That’s why it’s stupid. You’re the eldest Princess, the Heir to the Throne and yet they summon Elle and not you? Why? What have you done?’ Niall accused. It hurt. Ayda stood up, she was wrong to have trusted these humans with this knowledge she should have kept it to herself. They were never going to understand the importance of their ways. He had asked her the question she had punished herself with for years and she was not telling anyone that answer. That was her pain, her mistake and her regret.‘She doesn’t need to explain herself to a human!’ Syren spat angrily, standing up in Ayda’s defence.‘And what actually happens in this chamber?!’ Niall continued ignoring Syren.‘We don’t know – we don’t go in do we?’ Syren hissed. Ayda ignored him, her heart aching under the heavy strain of loss and emptiness, she curled up next to Elle and listened whilst Syren and Niall continued to bicker until Theo stepped in to end it. Ayda watched her young sister and wondered how much she had heard, she looked as though she was contentedly sleeping, but she knew better, neither of them would sleep well tonight.She was running, she had never run so fast in her life. Niall was there running with her, Syren ahead of her with Theo and Karl behind. They were screaming for Elle. Elle? She thought desperately, where are you? No?! Ayda was shouting with them and running, her legs were screaming with pain, but she ignored them she had to find Elle. Elle! She called desperately, hysteria rising. Her friends were now running of into the distance, her body cried out as she pushed herself to catch up. She heard cries of pain and shouts ahead, her friends needed her! She was running so fast now, she couldn’t see them, she called their names whilst still searching for Elle. Her breathing was harsh and quick, panic was setting in. She stopped, spinning around on the spot she cried out desperately. It was going to catch her, she could hear it behind her, approaching fast. Where were they?! She screamed as something tapped her on the shoulder, she spun around and saw Elle stood there, blood down the front of her nightdress.‘I’m sorry Ayda.’ She cried, tears running down her face, ‘it’s all my fault!’. Ayda felt a jolt and someone calling her name, Theo? She looked around for him, turning back, Brielle had disappeared, she opened her eyes.‘Sorry Ayda, you were being quite loud, but we need to get going now.’ Theo said kindly as he gently shook her awake. Her heart was hammering against her ribs and her breathing was shallow. She sighed, she knew she wasn’t going to get a good couple of hours sleep and they had a long day ahead of them, she didn’t need nightmares disturbing her sleeping moments and her thoughts haunting her when awake. Rubbing her eyes, she began to pack up the blankets, attaching the previous owners’ saddlebag she spotted Elle with the horses.‘Morning,’ She greeted her sister.‘Ayda I –’ Elle began.‘Good Morning! I have brought you some clean clothes!’ Niall announced, oblivious to the interruption. ‘Well not new, I have borrowed them for our good cause.’ He chuckled to himself as he held up some cream linen tunic and green trousers for Elle. He grinned broadly, clearly pleased with himself for finding them. Elle took the clothes from him with a small ‘thanks’ and disappeared to change.‘Great. Just great.’ Ayda uttered.‘What?’ Niall said aghast, ‘What have I done now?’‘She was about to talk to me!’ Ayda replied angrily.‘I – I’m sorry! I didn’t realise!’ He spluttered, ‘I just wanted to help!’‘Don’t you always!’ Ayda hissed before storming back to the camp to check on everyone.That stupid man, she thought. Elle could have been about to tell her something important, an answer to a question and he interrupted. And for what? Some farm boy’s outfit? She caught sight of Elle with Syren, who was plaiting her hair in a similar fashion to her own, so it wasn’t in the way. Ayda walked over to them. Elle looked up at her. She looked lost, lost in her own thoughts and memories. No doubt haunted by the events that have terrified her. Ayda could see she was going to need more time than they had.‘Elle, what happened yesterday?’ Ayda asked softly, taking her hand and leading her over to their horse. The Princess looked up at her and shook her head.‘I’m scared Ayda, you should have left me there.’ Elle whispered sadly. Solemnly, without another word Elle mounted the horse without help and waited for Ayda to climb on behind her. Once everyone was seated they moved.‘I would never have left you there.’ Ayda said firmly into Brielle’s ear. Brielle said nothing further, she sighed and gazed ahead. The companions pressed forwards. The sun was not yet up but they could see. Theo and Karl had gone to great efforts to ensure that the camp and fire were cleared and that there was nothing remaining to track. Ayda could only hope it was enough. The night’s rest had done its job. The horses were refreshed, and the riders were stronger and more cheerful. Niall and his friends were continuing their long prose, Ayda found it surprising how much the three of them had to discuss. Ayda and Elle however, were not much changed. Brielle was still silent, apparently Niall and Theo’s jokes and games were not enough to bring her out of her stupor which was not surprising as Syren found them downright annoying.‘Are we really going to have to put up with them?’ Syren muttered to Ayda in passing, ducking as Niall attempted to poke her with a stick aimed for her cheek.‘With the rest of you all miserable it’s our duty to provide some relief!’ Niall said mockingly, poking Theo in the arm with his treasured stick and winking at Elle. Ayda had to admit, watching the men chasing each other with sticks and occasionally racing and play jousting was quite amusing. She appreciated the gesture. At first, she was as annoyed as Syren, but she realised they were acting up to try and ease Elle out of her despair. A few times Niall and Theo attempted to get Elle involved by poking her or asking for her favours before ‘battle’, Elle participated, but begrudgingly. The journey through the forest was uneventful, Ayda found herself treasuring the moments of peace knowing that they were surely not meant to last. Watching Niall and Theo had loosened the weights around her heart and she felt lighter, more hopeful, but she could not rid herself of the nagging worry clinging onto her with sharp claws. Elle still had not stirred, the little Princess at the Castle would have revelled in the games of these two Fiends, but she seemed uninterested. Ayda knew that whatever her concerns were, Elle was hiding something dark, deep within her soul and she had to help her, she had to share the burden that was eating away at her childhood. At last, by late morning they reached the edge of the forest. Ahead of them were lush green fields spread miles ahead of them, canvassing the land all around them. Niall let out a long whistle.‘It’s going to be hard to hide out there.’ He said.‘Well what do you suggest? There’s no other way to the wastes.’ Ayda replied.‘The River Myr?’ Theo asked, looking to Karl.‘We could follow the River north, but it will take longer, and they will most likely be watching the bridges.’ Karl agreed, rubbing his chin. Ayda was perplexed, the Wastes had felt like the safest place because no one ever travelled there. There was no green, no water and it was almost uninhabitable except for a small abandoned village. Ayda had forgotten that the journey there was going to be difficult to make undetected. She had no idea who she could trust. Even the people who greeted her with such enthusiasm on their Royal Progress could now be her enemy, she had to be smart and find a way around. Looking over the landscape ahead of her she took in the beauty of her country. The edge of the forest was a top a slight hill, she was lucky to have the vantage of looking down and plotting a course. She spied several small white stone settlements spotted over the fields, they would need to avoid those. Finally, she came up with a plan.‘From here we can see miles around us,’ She said clearly, ‘I suggest we move from high ground to high ground, there are several small hillsides where we can scour the landscape for the safest route. We should be able to see an army or hunting party from these.’ She pointed out the mounds of earth she was aiming for. The other’s nodded.‘It seems like a plan where a lot could go wrong, but I don’t see another option.’ Niall responded thoughtfully.‘It’s the best we’ve got.’ Theo agreed.‘In that case, I’ll meet you at the first one.’ Syren said, turning her horse away.‘What do you mean? Where are you going?’ Ayda turned to face her.‘Right now, we are travelling blind, we have no idea where our enemies are, what they know or who they are,’ Syren replied, ‘I intend to find out.’‘How?’ Ayda asked, worried.‘Inns and Taverns are always the best place for gossip.’ Niall explained. Syren nodded in agreement.‘Can I come?’ Niall asked eagerly.‘No.’‘I won’t get in your way, I’d just, um… have a drink?’‘No. Even if I wanted you with me you’d only be killed on sight.’ Syren ended the conversation impatiently. Bidding farewell to the Princesses she rode down the hill, Ayda watched as she hid her blades and placed her hood over her hair and made in the direction of the closest Town. Please get back safely, Ayda prayed.‘I think she’s starting to like me,’ Niall said happily, ‘she wouldn’t have even considered me before, now she’s concerned for my wellbeing.’‘I don’t think that’s what she was getting at mate,’ Theo thumped Niall’s shoulder laughing. Karl shook his head smirking at them. Kicking her horse forward, Ayda led them on. Down the hillside they plodded away from the forest, out into the open, the sun was nearly at its peak, blazing warmth down upon them. Ayda couldn’t help feeling cold. She couldn’t help remembering the last time her closest friend disappeared to help her, only that time he didn’t return. She couldn’t even say or think of his name anymore. There were cuts born of guilt so deep in her heart they would never be removed. He had died for her. She desperately wished Syren wouldn’t join him. For miles around them, the fields were lush and green, wild flowers of all colours and sizes were blossoming in the sun, big ancient trees stood tall amidst saplings born years ago, branches and leaves from smaller trees straining to keep up. Ayda watched with her sister as hundreds of birds danced and pirouetted across the sky forming waves upon waves of wings glistening with the sun. On they rode, taking in the natural splendour of the fertile land around them. Even Niall and Theo were silent, soaking up the peace, relishing the warm afternoon sun on their cold faces. On they walked for the rest of the day, every so often one of the humans would leave them, circle back and then re-join the party to make sure they weren’t being followed. Ayda’s thoughts were with her friend, she hoped more than anything that Syren would return to her. She had lost too many loved ones, the dull ache of her parent’s death and the memory of her father’s lifeless body would haunt her for the rest of her life, she couldn’t bear to add Syren to the pain. They walked on all day with no problems or encounters, and as the sun began to set they were nearing the top of the view point they had decided to rest upon. There wasn’t as much cover as Ayda had hoped, finding a small cluster of trees she went about setting Elle’s bed whilst the others took advantage of the remaining light to scout the area and spot anyone approaching from the hillside.Slowly night took hold. It was a beautiful night, mild and clear. Excusing themselves from the conversation being held by Niall and Karl, Ayda and Elle lay on the soft grass watching the stars overhead. Ayda took comfort in the small pinpricks of light penetrating the deep black sea above them. They looked close but when she reached out to touch one they were out of reach. Ayda allowed her mind to wander as her little sister admired the moonlight that rained down on them. She had not had time to think in peace without the feeling of unease or ache from travelling in her muscles, the thoughts in her head were so jumbled and confusing, like little jigsaw pieces she hadn’t had time to fit into place. She decided to start at the beginning. The Ritual. What had scared Elle so much at the Ritual? She had been spoken to, Elle had told her that much, but she didn’t know what was said that scared her. Then there was the attack on her. Her own comrades and Soldiers who she had trained with and fought with so many times, had turned on her. Betrayed her family, killed her Father and presumably her Mother and somehow succeeded in bringing down a centuries old Castle? She needed to know who had given these orders and whose authority was so absolute it went against the King himself. Who wanted her family killed – and why? Ayda knew that her little sister could probably provide the answers to most – if not all the questions, but her silence had continued all day.Ayda turned her head to look at her sister’s face. She could see long streams of glistening tears running down the Princesses face and getting lost in her blonde hair. She squeezed her hand in comfort.‘Do you think Mother and Father are up there?’ Elle whispered softly in her small girlish voice. Ayda looked up at the stars again. Pointing at the brightest one she replied,‘They are the brightest stars and always watching us.’ Ayda smiled slightly, taking comfort in the star that shone so brightly, Ayda realised that she was now watching the star and could see her Father smiling down on them. Suddenly she felt stronger, more able to do what she needed to do. He was watching them, and he would protect them.‘He died for me.’ Elle whispered sadly, the star reflecting brightly in her watery gaze.‘What do you mean?’ Ayda replied, holding her breath.‘The bad man wanted me, but Father wouldn’t let him.’‘What bad man? Wanted you why?’ Ayda sat up quickly, breathing fast she gave Elle time to reply.‘He-he was wearing a red cloak and gold mask. He tried to kill me.’ Elle said feebly.‘The Legion?!’ Ayda exclaimed flabbergasted. The Legion were the Guards of the Elders. They were very rarely seen as they usually stayed with their Masters. In fact, Ayda could not recall a time anyone had ever seen them, her Father nor Mother had ever seen them, they were only known to people through the teachings of the Scholars, many thought them a myth. Why would they want to kill Brielle? Why would the Elder’s want to kill Brielle? If this was true, what chance did they have against the most elite soldiers and the only mages left in the world?‘Elle, what scared you at the Ritual?’ She asked calmly, it would not do to let Elle see how worried she was. Elle sat up and shook her head slowly.‘Father said –’‘Father’s dead. If I’m going to protect you, I need to know everything,’ Ayda said firmly. She felt guilty for the words and for the tears brimming in her young sister’s eyes, but the truth was the truth and she had to know what the Princess knew, their lives depended on finding out why they were being hunted.‘I heard a woman,’ Elle whispered almost inaudibly, as though keeping the secret from the air around them, ‘She told me to get out. She was scared.’‘This girl – she wasn’t an Elder?’ Ayda asked confused. Elle shook her head profusely. Great, Ayda thought, this didn’t answer any questions and just added to the list of things she didn’t know. So, who was the girl and why did she want to get Elle out of the Ritual Chamber, nothing made sense. The only connection she could see was the Elders, but she had no idea what to do about that, she couldn’t demand they speak with her. They both sat in silence, both trapped in their own thoughts. Both searching for answers to questions. Sometime after, Niall came and found them, and they returned to the camp and got ready for a rough night’s sleep.‘Did she tell you anything?’ Niall asked quietly after Ayda came back from settling Elle down for the night. Ayda started to answer when they heard a distinct crack of a twig. The four of them jumped up quickly, weapons drawn, Ayda’s eyes were straining to see ahead of them in the dark. Slowly and quietly they moved towards sleeping Elle.‘Who’s there?’ Niall asked loudly, even though he was trying his best to sound confident she could hear the nervous waiver in his voice.‘Stand down it’s only me.’ Replied a familiar voice. Syren had re-joined them. Ayda breathed a silent sigh of relief. She was back. She was safe. Well safer.‘How did you know where we were?’ Niall spat, cursing her for making him jump.‘I didn’t, I’ve been wandering this hilltop for a while, it was only when I heard you that I knew where you were.’ Syren said quietly.‘Did anyone follow you?’ Karl asked gruffly.‘No and I’m fine thank you for asking.’ Syren said impatiently. Ayda clapped her on the shoulder.‘Good to see you,’ Ayda said gently, ‘Any news?’ The five of them sat down again not far from Elle. Syren started rummaging around in a bag and pulled out a loaf of bread, some fruit and cold meats. The others groaned thanks as they tucked in to the meal. Ayda had only just noticed the ache of hunger in the pit of her stomach and went to give Elle some of the food before returning to the small but merry feast. They hadn’t eaten much all day, just occasional fruit they picked going through the fields.‘I took the liberty of getting some food for the journey, but we’ll have to ration it, I couldn’t take too much without arousing suspicion.’ Syren said through a mouthful of hard bread. They ate in silence, each relishing every mouthful until the food in front of them was devoured.‘The Stone City has fallen.’ Syren said bitterly. Ayda looked at her and waited for her to continue. ‘The attack on the Stone City is the talk of the village. It is rumoured that the Legion have pulled out everyone from their homes looking for Elle. There are also scouts searching for you.’‘What of my people?’ Ayda asked. She remembered the times when her family would go on progress through Myrliar, her people were always so happy to see them, they would throw flowers and sing songs of love and peace, she had forgotten that in this struggle for power, everyone would be affected.‘The Legion have turned people out on the streets and forbidden anyone to aid you. Some have come out to support you and have been flayed for it. Young girls have been taken from their parents and examined to make sure they’re not your sister. Families that resist or hinder any search are killed on the spot.’ Syren said all this quickly as if to rid herself of the taste of it on her tongue. Ayda could not bear to think of the families being torn apart and all the blood shed on the white stone floors of her City.‘Who oversees Myrliar now?’ Ayda asked with a heavy heart.‘The Captain of the Legion apparently.’ Syren replied.‘Why have they done this? Why have they overturned my family, ours was a reign of peace!’ Ayda fumed, her blood boiling, the injustice and terror of everything that had happened to her family and country were too much to bear, and she was still no closer to getting any answers.‘The Legion are controlled by the Elders you say?’ Niall asked quietly.‘Yes, they are sworn guardians of the Elders.’ Ayda nodded.‘And the Ritual connects you Elves with the Elders?’ He asked. Ayda nodded again, curious.‘So, if Elle was scared after the Ritual, maybe she saw something she wasn’t meant to?’ Niall suggested, palms open in offering.‘And the girl telling Elle to get out?’ Ayda asked hopefully. Syren’s confused face looked between them, and Ayda brought her up to speed on what Elle had shared.‘The girl warned her, she knew the Elders would find out?’ Niall said, unsure of his own thoughts. Ayda had come to the same theory in her mind. The secret seemed to lay with Elle, but she was sure her sister had now told her everything.‘How on earth did someone communicate with Elle telepathically?’ Syren asked, bewildered.Ayda had been asking herself the same question. She had heard of this skill before, but no one had the power to do it for centuries.‘Magic.’ Came a quiet voice, Elle had woken and sat next to them without anyone realising.‘Impossible.’ Ayda said rather too quickly, slightly concerned that the young girl had gotten to them without any of them hearing anything.Niall laughed, ‘Magic? Are you serious?’‘You humans have never had magic?’ Syren asked curiously.‘No, never.’ Theo snorted, unsure whether it was a joke.‘Elves and Humans possessed powerful magic thousands of years ago, but through blood lines over time, it dwindled out, no one has ever seen, possessed or practised magic in centuries,’ Ayda told them, ‘We were brought up on history over the years, mages were present on both sides in the Great War that engulfed our people.’‘The Ritual is believed to be a chance for Elves to regain their magic and knowledge through communing with the Elders.’ Elle added, Syren was shaking her head at Ayda, she still didn’t trust the humans with the secrets of Myrliar. In the distance a howl could be heard, ghost like and clear as the stars above. It didn’t sound very close, so the companions took it as a cue to get some rest, with Karl on first watch. Ayda curled up once again around her sister, ready for fitful sleep.‘Ayda, Ayda...’Ayda shrugged off the hands that were annoying her, she couldn’t have been asleep that long. Just a little longer, there was another day of travelling ahead and she was still aching from the day before.She drifted back off to sleep. A sharp pain in the leg woke her and she cried out loud as she awoke.‘What the hell –’ She began to shout, but someone put a hand over her mouth, she struggled against them, not being completely awake she panicked, until she saw Elle just in front of her urging her to quiet down.‘Will you shut up?’ Niall spat in her ear. She nodded furiously, and he let her go.‘The howling is closer, we think the wolves are near our campsite.’ Syren explained coolly. Ayda sighed, there goes their night’s rest.‘Elle get up a tree, will you?’ Ayda said to her sister pointing at the closest one.‘Good idea. Princess, go on.’ Theo pushed her gently. With some help from the other’s Elle managed to shimmy up the tree and behind the leaves, out of sight. Ayda relaxed a little, the wolves would never get her up there, shame they weren’t built for more people. The howling sent goosebumps up her back. The hairs all over her body stood tall and alert. She was very aware of the sudden drop in temperature, as her lungs filled with ice and her breath caught in her chest. Ayda saw the others in front of her, circling her with their weapons raised. Karl with his broadsword stood like a giant over the others, Theo and Syren with their twin swords poised and Niall with his sword loosely at his side. Ayda unsheathed her own sword, she had taken down wolves before on Patrol, this shouldn’t be too difficult she reasoned calming herself. Unless there’s too many. The howling grew closer, they were nearly upon them. Something didn’t feel right, Ayda thought, the other’s in front were nervously looking around, their breath fogging in the moonlight. They had all encountered wolves before, but the growl of these wolves was, ghostly. A gritty, rough growling sounded all around them, glass twinkling through the dark.They were here. Ayda prepared her sword, and held it outstretched in front of her as the wolves ripped through the undergrowth. Several of her allies cursed loudly as they saw what was tearing towards them. A flash of silver fur and red eyes approached as wolves the size of lions hurtled towards them, growling in anticipation. Ayda watched in horror as one of the monsters leapt at her red-haired friend, who neatly rolled over to slice its underbelly as it flew overhead. Ayda had to admire her friend’s skill. The wolf, though hurt, did not stop there, it flew at her snapping at her as Syren pummelled it repeatedly with her blades. These were not normal wolves Ayda realised. Their silver fur was glowing in the moonlight and their red eyes were filled with an all-consuming bloodlust. Ayda jumped in to stab the monster repeatedly, together Ayda and Syren finished it off, just as another appeared growling. Ayda turned and saw four wolves attacking the humans. Niall, Theo and Karl were impressive, each one fluent in their dance, each of them understanding the other, when one struck, the other defended. As Karl landed a killing blow across the throat of a monster, Niall smacked another in the head to block its attack. The wolves were strong, and had razor sharp teeth and claws, but they were slow, they had to use this to their advantage. On and on they fought together, the five of them huddled as close together as possible, their resolve frightening, as they roared louder than the wolves. More and more wolves approached.‘We – can’t – keep this – going – forever!’ Syren screamed breathlessly as she slid her blade into the roof of a wolf’s mouth. ‘Aargh!’ She cried with pain, Ayda looked around and saw blood seeping from a fresh slice in her friend’s arm. The allies were all sporting their own cuts and wounds, they were slowly being ripped apart, and they would not last much longer before they tired from the onslaught of monsters. A thud on the ground shook her as she watched Theo fall backwards crying in pain, clutching his leg, Ayda saw a nasty bite mark shedding blood beneath his linens, he cursed loudly. Niall hacked off the wolf’s head with several blows, spilling blackened blood on the ground before returning with Karl to defend their brother. Time was running out, they were one down, Ayda was sure soon others would fall. Jumping aside Ayda timed a perfect hit as she slashed the side of a wolf. Too late, she realised she had pushed herself into the path of another that had thrown itself at her. Her chest felt as though it had been crushed under a pile of rock, claws were digging into her shoulders as the beast pressed her into the ground. Its teeth were mere inches from her skin gnashing together waiting for the taste of her blood. Using all her strength she pushed the wolf away from her, it was no use, it was too strong.‘Ayda!’ Niall bellowed. She heard the shouts of her friends around her, daring a look she could see they would never get to her in time, they were still struggling with their own beasts. She pushed with all her remaining strength, struggling to keep the teeth from her throat, the wolf thrashing around snapping its jaws angrily. Struggling she realised she was losing. A high-pitched shriek sounded across the hill. The world around her flashed a brilliant red and yellow, as flames scorched the air, Ayda strained a look above her. What she saw stopped her heart. Elle had climbed down from the tree to aid them, her arms were stretched wide and strings of flames were firing from her hands, white hot and blazing, snaking their way around the wolves before her. One by one the wolves howled in pain. The smell of burning flesh reached Ayda as the flames burnt holes like snakes through their bodies. Some fled but did not get far before Elle’s flames torched them into ash. Ayda wept as she watched her little sister’s face, grim determination was sketched across every feature. Her eyes were black and strained. She looked older, so much older. The wolf bearing down on Ayda burned internally and collapsed onto Ayda, who with her last breath looked at Elle and realised with shock, her sister was a Mage.",

      "content": "7– AYDAThe storm had taken its toll on them. Ayda’s cloak was soaked through and clinging to her frame, water running off the light armour beneath. Syren’s red hair was darkened with water and stuck flat to her body. Their horses were broken, exhausted from the hard ride through the dense forest that surrounded the First Wall of Myrliar. The wall was now visible, the storm had finally cleared as quickly as it had raged. The rain and winds had been heavy when she had left Niall, but that storm had turned deadly and angry almost instantly, as if the Elder’s themselves had conjured it. The clouds had thundered in black and dark, haunting the world. Ayda had not slowed despite the danger, she was desperate to get her little sister to safety. The treachery of her comrades clung painfully at her heart, she would mourn their friendship later, for now, she had to get to Elle.‘We can’t just walk into the City, someone clearly wants you dead.” Syren said quietly to Ayda.‘We have to find a way in and quickly,’ Ayda insisted, attempting to hide the panic in her voice, she could not bear to think what could be happening to her family, they could already be dead. No, she thought, I cannot think like that. Hiding their weak horses in the brush, Ayda and Syren slowly approached the First Wall, hiding behind a cluster of trees, they scoured the wall. The Wall towered above the ancient trees of the forest. Small, iron barred windows were dotted along it, figures of Guards and Soldiers could be seen moving from window to window carrying out their daily duties. Ayda was grateful for her training, as a Soldier of the Golden Army she knew the First Wall and the Barracks within very well. If they were careful maybe they could sneak through unnoticed.‘They’ve closed the gates!’ Syren whispered urgently. Ayda’s eyes snapped to the entrance of the Wall, the huge stone and steel gates were down and sealed, shielding Myrliar from any unwanted visitors. Ayda sighed, the situation had gone from difficult to impossible. The gates of the First Wall were only ever closed at time of war with the Humans, in her lifetime, she could not remember them being sealed once. Were they keeping her out, or her family in?‘What do we do?’ Syren asked, still crouching low behind the trees next to her. Ayda looked around helplessly for inspiration, she felt the panic rising, she had no idea how they could penetrate a wall that an Army could not bring down. She considered scaling it, but the white stone was so smooth they were not going to get a foothold. ‘I could always try to sneak in, the Guards are looking for you not me.’ Syren suggested. The thought had occurred to Ayda, but she had no idea how her friend would explain being without the Patrol, they must know they were close sparring partners. It was too dangerous. She relayed these thoughts to the red-haired elf.‘So, we can’t climb, dig or walk in.’ Syren muttered, kicking the dirt in frustration. Ayda ignored her friend. A sickness had crept to her stomach and was threatening to pull her on all fours. Her little sister was so far away from her. Ayda had been able to fight her way out with help from her friends, but Elle was so small, so weak, she would stand no chance of getting away from the Army. Then there were her parents, the King and Queen of Myrliar. Had they lost power? Had someone risen and removed them from their Throne? Was anyone in that Castle fighting for them? Ayda felt helpless, she had ridden hard against the ferocious storm to help her family, but she was still no nearer to holding her little sister. Syren, spotting the look of defeat on Ayda’s face moved forwards.‘I’m sure she is safe, no-one could deem your sister a threat, Sir Rakel or Sir Morcei would have got them out, I’m sure of it.’ At the mention of Sir Rakel, a spark ignited, fighting the deep despair in which she had begun to drown. He was a lifelong friend of her Father, no matter what, he would be standing with her family. She smiled weakly at her comrade.‘I thought you two would be in and out by now!’ Someone called to them close by. Three men climbed through the thicket towards them. The leader walked lazily, swinging his arms with a carefree look on his face. The two men behind looked much less at ease, both with their hands firmly around the hilt of their favourite blade.‘What are you doing here?’ Ayda spat at Niall.‘That is not nice.’ Niall jested, ‘I thought Princesses were supposed to have manners.’ He dipped quickly into a bow with a smile on his face, the handsome young man to his left smirked.Niall clapped his hands together carelessly. ‘So, what’s the plan your Highness?’‘What?’ Ayda asked confused.‘How are we getting in there to get the little Elf?’ Theo asked enthusiastically from Niall’s left. Ayda blushed, embarrassed. She had no plan. She had absolutely no idea how to get into her own home. Niall laughed loudly. Karl smacked him on the back with a firm ‘Quiet!’ which silenced him momentarily. ‘The Princess doesn’t know her own home Karl – it’s funny.’‘What are you going on about?! Do YOU know how to get in? You’ve never even been here before.’ Ayda spat angrily at him for mocking her. Niall shrugged.‘Here’s the deal. I’ll get you in that Castle, get your little Princess and then we take our horses back.’ Niall said simply. Ayda felt a slight annoyance at the bargain. So, he had not come back to help her, he just wanted what was his.‘Fine.’ She snapped. Niall grabbed her hand and shook it so excessively, she knew he was playing with her. She was not in the mood for his games, she wanted to see her family so desperately she would do anything it took. Niall gestured for them to follow him. Ayda followed him and his friends at a slight distance, she heard him complaining to Karl about the smack he had received and rolled her eyes.‘Where do you think he’s taking us?’ Syren whispered to her as she walked close by.‘I have no idea. He seems to know where he’s going though.’ Ayda replied quietly.‘I think we should get rid of them. It’s the law, I don’t trust them.’ Syren said, her voice full of loathing. Ayda knew her friend would be distrustful of the humans, Syren didn’t have any kind memories of any that she had encountered, all she saw was pain and years of hate. Ayda looked at the young man prancing in front of her. Niall was certainly the boy she had met when she was a child. He was still naughty and mischievous, she was curious as to his sudden knowledge of Myrliar. Ayda had not been too happy to see him, memories of her old friend had resurfaced upon seeing his face, a past she wished would stay in the shadows where it belonged. How annoying that Niall should save her life not once – but twice! Niall continued leading the way, she knew they were following the outer wall round as the five of them traipsed through the forest surrounding the Stone City. They grew closer and closer to the Pearl Mountains.‘If you’re planning on climbing the Pearl Mountains to get to the Castle then stop. There are Patrols protecting the Castle from anyone attempting this.’ Ayda called to him. Niall ignored her and walked on. Furious at being ignored, she sped up to him.‘How can you possibly know where we’re going?’ She demanded.‘Do you want to stand here and talk, or do you want to get to your family?’ He said exasperated. She nodded, agreeing that the conversation could wait until she had Elle under her wing. Ayda was angry with him though, his whole demeanour angered her. Her family was ruined, and he was taking a daily stroll through the forest. How can he know more about this Castle than her? He was a stranger, and this was her home. The mountains were so close now, clusters of brilliant white boulders were dotted around the forest and against the First Wall. She felt no nearer to her sister. ‘You two wait here.’ Niall said without looking at them. He, Theo and Karl, swords raised wandered behind a group of rocks, larger than two homes and disappeared for several moments before Theo reappeared and waved them over.‘Had to check it wasn’t guarded.’ Theo shrugged leading the way behind the towering rocks. Ayda’s eyebrow raised as she saw Niall and Karl leaning casually against the rock, swigging from his hip flask. Behind him was a small rough tunnel entrance well hidden from the eye.‘How did you know this was here!?’ Ayda said, dumbstruck. Niall laughed, reattached his flask to his belt and led them down towards the tunnel mouth. The tunnel itself was a squeeze, single file behind Niall they all followed, tripping occasionally on loose rock and uneven ground and crouching beneath low ceilings. The bright white stone darkened slowly as they moved deeper into the tunnel, Ayda realised that very soon they wouldn’t even see each-other. She suggested they each place a hand on the person in front’s shoulder, she was then repulsed to realise she had to touch Niall, who was humming a tune. Theo behind her and Syren and Karl behind him, they tripped and meandered through the black tunnel of white stone.‘Are we going to get lost?’ Syren echoed through the darkness.‘No, thankfully there is only one way to go.’ Niall explained, who was using his hands to feel the wall as he stumbled on, with Ayda’s disgusted hand on his shoulder. More than once the party had to stop as someone tripped and fell, amidst cursing and bruised knees Ayda was getting fed up.‘Why didn’t you prepare a torch?’ She asked bitterly.‘Because you were in a rush.’ Niall replied shortly, he was no longer humming and Ayda could tell he too was aching from his most recent trip. Good, she thought. Thankfully after an age of hiking light pierced their eyes. Ayda squinted from the harshness but was relieved when fresh air and warmth filled her. Her feet found level ground as they left the tunnel. Her eyes adjusting, she looked quickly around. They were in a garden. Her friends were squinting, pausing as they took note of each other in a silent head count.‘Oh my – Ayda!’ Syren shouted in alarm looking over Ayda’s head in shock. Ayda spun around. What she saw brought her to her knees. She screamed loudly and unashamedly crying for her family – how could they have survived that? The others stood as still as the mountains as they attempted to make sense of the scene before them. A vast portion of the once proud White Castle had collapsed. The Towers and parapets had crumpled into themselves and the walls of her home had crashed to the ground, hidden beneath a thick layer of white stone dust. Bodies of soldiers, servants and lords were scattered or crushed beneath the centuries old stone. Ayda could hear the ghost of the crashing collapse of her grand home amidst the eerie silence of destruction. She could distantly hear the agonizing screams and shrieks from the people unlucky enough to be trampled by the cascading stone. The Stone Castle had fallen way before she had arrived home, yet she imagined and felt every ounce of pain as the great symbol of protection fell to its knees in defeat. Her home was gone, what had happened to her family? As though on fire, Ayda launched herself forward. She could see that the Throne room and Grand Halls were just standing, fragile and leaning on the verge of collapse, the rest of the Castle was sand and dust. Leaving the other’s behind she hurled herself through the gardens jumping over rubble and ignoring the sounds of the dying. She HAD to get her sister! Distantly someone was calling her name, she climbed the white stone steps, skipping over more debris crumbling from the remnants of her home. “Elle!” She shouted repeatedly. She did not care who could hear her, from her eyes all that was left was pain and death, there was nothing here she could be bothered to fear. Her sister was her lifeline and her courage. Someone grabbed her roughly from behind and pulled her to the floor.‘Get off me!’ She snarled, kicking out she winded her assailant before crawling back up the steps.‘Ayda stop!’ He shouted. She recognised the voice.‘Help me Niall!’ She shouted desperately as she floundered up the dusty steps in such a hurry her feet could hardly keep up. She felt him push her as she regained her footing and propelled her forward with him running to keep up. She reached the Grand Hall, the beautiful masonry of the walls was crumbling, and the stone floors were veined with slits and cracks. The ornate tables were crushed beneath parts of ceiling and several statues of ancestors had been unceremoniously decapitated or flattened. Slower and more cautiously, Ayda and Niall moved through the Grand Hall, the large oak doors at the top of the rooms were off their hinges as the doorway had started to waiver. Climbing over the doors together they entered the Throne room. Ayda gasped as Niall cursed. Tens of Golden Clad soldiers were littered along the floor. Some had been impaled and some had shared the same fate as the Castle. Ayda’s eyes brimmed with tears as she saw her parent’s thrones standing, untouched and glistening against the odds. The chink of stone on stone fell like the pitter patter of rain, as portions of the last bones of the Castle began to fail. She heard a quiet sob. A childlike sob. Casting around she took in every detail of the room she had feared the most. Her heart burned with a heat so intense as she saw the blonde curly hair of her little sister.‘Elle!’ She cried loudly in relief. She bounded over to her sister with Niall just behind. ‘Oh Elle! I’ve been so –’ She stopped. Brielle looked up with her big puffy red eyes revealing the body she was clinging onto with every grain of strength she had.Their Father.The relief she felt at finding her sister was smothered by the sorrow that now shrouded her heart in ice. Her Father’s eyes were closed, his face peaceful. Reaching out, Ayda gently removed dust from his cold, lined complexion and pressed her lips to his forehead, vaguely aware of Niall lingering a polite distance away and the continual rain of stone around them. Death surrounded them on all sides, she knew they could not stay here, but she was content to stay trapped in this moment, as she knew with all her heart this would be the last time she would see her father’s kind face, the last time she would feel his fingers entwined with hers. He was cold, Elle was not. She had to get her sister to safety. Her Father would thank her for that. She pulled hard at Elle and tugged her away from the fallen King,‘Come on Elle, we need to go.’ She said softly, a lump catching in her throat, ‘Leave him, we cannot help him.’ Hearing crumbling stone, Ayda wasted no time in heaving the weeping Princess away. Ayda could not believe how easy it was to walk away from her Father, but she knew that Brielle was now her only priority, she had promised her Father to protect her, he would be urging them to leave this death trap. Niall led the way out from the ruins in silence, time seemed to freeze as the walls continued to crumble and groan. Not daring to look back at their home the Princesses climbed the Castle rubble and returned to their friends in the Gardens.‘Any trouble?’ Karl asked gruffly as they approached. Niall shook his head solemnly and moved towards the tunnel entrance without stopping. Following his lead, the others followed on in silence. Ensuring Elle was safely following Syren, Ayda braved one last look at her childhood home. Glancing around she shed a tear as the Castle groaned a relieved farewell as it slid to the ground in a cloud of white dust, no longer straining to protect those who had grown up in its safety.The walk back to the horses was a long and quiet one. After Niall had briefly explained to the other’s what had happened, no-one felt much like talking. The loss of a King was a shock, but the loss of a Father felt like a death sentence. Their Father was dead, and from what she had seen, she doubted her Mother was alive. Ayda grieved for them, for she now shouldered their responsibility. She had to find out who was responsible for the attack on her family and she had to protect Elle. Ayda looked down at the young girl, clutching at her arm. Her blonde hair was messy, her nightdress dirty and torn and her face blotchy and red, Brielle was never going to be the same carefree little Princess she was before. As they reached the horses, Ayda took the reins of hers and Syren’s mounts and pressed them into Niall’s hands. Their deal was complete.‘Thank you for all that you have done for us.’ She said quietly, not able to look him in the eye. Why was it that whenever death touched her life, he was always close by? She could not look at him, she was afraid that she would see the eyes of those she had lost.‘Where are you going now?’ He asked.‘North, up to the Wastes. I need to keep Elle away from here. I cannot lose her too.’ Niall looked over his shoulder towards Theo and Karl, who returned his look with a nod each, they mounted their horses and readied themselves. Niall placed the reins back into Ayda’s hands.‘You won’t get far without these, it’s a long way.’ Niall said with a slight smile as Ayda met his understanding eyes. He had known loss himself, he lived with the emptiness she saw. For the first time she found herself wondering what happened to the boy she had left behind, what had happened to his Pa? With a slight pang of guilt, she remembered that after all the past years she had forgotten her saviour’s name. Niall lowered himself, so he was face to face with Elle. He held out his hand and took her palm in his.‘Your Highness, if you are agreeable, my brothers and I would like to join your Guard, until it is safe to leave your side.’ He said pleasantly. Brielle watched the stranger closely, taking in every feature of his face. She looked up at her sister with wide eyes and moved closer‘Why are humans in Myrliar?’ Elle whispered to her sister. Ayda winced at her words, she knew that Syren would prefer their human counterpart’s dead, or at least banished, but Ayda found that a part of her trusted them, despite their differences.‘They saved my life, Elle, and helped me get to you.’ Ayda replied calmly. Syren moved forwards.‘We don’t need them anymore Ayda, we have Princess Brielle.’ She said stiffly. Ayda regarded her friend. Syren was a fierce young warrior, she had trained with Ayda since they were young elves. Her vibrant red hair was plaited messily after the recent rains, her stance glistened of confidence and skill, with her blade at her waist and her glistening greaves and vambraces. Syren wore minimal armour, she hated how heavy it was, and Ayda could not deny that her friend was quick for it (she had taken many sharp jabs from her during sparring).‘That’s the gratitude we get for saving your lives?’ Karl snarled at her.‘I believe the attack on us benefitted YOU greatly!’ Syren replied hotly, her voice rising.Ayda watched her comrade with admiration. Syren was almost half the size of Karl, who was a beast of a man. His huge arms and shoulders were built for sheer strength he looked capable of crushing Syren with his bare fist, if he could catch her first. Syren look unaffected as she stood her ground before him.‘We should go back Niall, Elves will always be Elves.’ Karl dismissed walking away from Syren. Niall looked at the little Princess who was watching with round eyes, and then turned to Ayda. He looked at her miserably.‘Is that what you want?’ He asked softly. Ayda looked to her friend apologetically, she hoped she would forgive her.‘All I want is to protect Elle, I have lost everyone I love, she is my life now. She is the future.’ Ayda began seriously, ‘If you swear to help me protect her, then you are most welcome.’‘But they are HUMAN Ayda!’ Syren repeated, aghast.‘Yes Syren, they are human. Our sworn enemies. But who has murdered my family? I see no human hand behind this.’ Ayda reasoned with her friend calmly. Syren backed down. Ayda knew they were both stung and hurt by the betrayal of their own comrades and had no way of defending them. They had to find out why her family had been overthrown by their own Army, she had to know why she had lost her parents and her home. She could only thank the Elders that her young sister was beside her, she was never going to let her go. Syren mounted her horse in silence and moved forwards with a nod to Ayda, who was already comforting Elle and helping her into the saddle before climbing up behind her. Niall clapped his hands together in eagerness and vaulted on to his saddle, patting Karl on the shoulder as he passed. Karl, still scowling, followed on behind Theo’s horse, positively glaring at the red head in front. Ayda sighed, this was not going to be an easy alliance. As the sun began to disappear behind the Pearl Mountains, the horses trudged on through the quiet forest, north past the Stone City. The occasional patter of water droplets on leaves could be heard as a gentle breeze whispered through the trees. Ayda had decided they should proceed at a steady pace for now, as the horses had been riding hard throughout the day and they had no knowledge as to the whereabout of their enemies. The elf did not want to lead them headlong into an army on exhausted mounts. Ayda had to admit even she was tired. The allies had not stopped for breath since the attack on Ayda and had rushed to save her family. Silence had blanketed each of them, too tired, too weary and too agitated to talk. Syren was still leading from the front, determined in her anger at being made to work alongside humans, she had not spoken a word since they mounted their steeds. Weakness had overwhelmed the older Princess. The darkness of the night was a bright light compared to the shadow over her heart. She could not shake the memory of her father, pale and cold in her poor sister’s arms. She longed to speak to Elle, to ask her what had happened, but she feared she should not interrogate her so soon. She was so fragile, she was like a small and intricate ice sculpture that she dared not hold for fear but could not bear to set aside defencelessly. She was sure that Elle would talk to her. Eventually.‘We must camp.’ Theo announced, making Ayda jump slightly. She turned in her horse to look at them. There was no sound of hooves on dirt, no whinnying, they had stopped all around her and, yet she could hardly see them.‘Theo’s right, if we continue in this dark we risk laming our horses.’ Niall agreed. She heard him moan as he dismounted and a moment later his boots hit the ground with a squelch. The other’s murmured their assent. Ayda did not much like the idea of stopping, she had hoped to distance themselves from the Stone City, but they had not even reached the edge of the forest.‘Ayda, the soldiers in that Castle were dead, I don’t think we have anything to fear this night.’ Niall reasoned, his hand appeared from the darkness to help lower Elle to the ground.‘They will return.’ Ayda said firmly, her legs aching she clambered off the horse.‘They will likely regroup first before returning, and they will not want to travel in this. We will move north again as soon as we can see where we’re walking.’ Niall said patiently. Ayda hesitated, she wanted to move Elle on.‘Ayda, they think they have Elle trapped in there. The City is on lock down and no-one’s seen her leave. We have some time to rest.’ Syren said tiredly. Ayda turned around and saw a roaring fire had already been lit, the warmth of the fire swept over her cold, damp and aching body like a wave, leaving the tips of her fingers tingling with pleasure. The crackling fire persuaded her. Her comrades had moved closer to it and were warming themselves peacefully by the flames. The ground surrounding the fire quickly dried out and she found herself grateful for the shelter the thick trees provided. Slowly each of them settled down to relax by the fire. Ayda unravelled some of the belongings from her horse and was relieved to find the previous rider had provided them with a few essentials. After drying out some blankets by the fire, Ayda set about making a place for her sister to rest. Theo had disappeared for a short while after stopping and had returned with a couple of hares which he then prepared and cooked on the fire. Everyone had eaten quietly except for Elle, who refused. Elle had been sat by the fire, staring into the dark abyss around them and not talking to anyone, occasionally panicking when Ayda left them to find something amongst the trees. Niall and Theo however seemed to have a career in conversation, they led a constant stream of jovial chatter which seemed to have common themes of ale, women and trouble. Although Karl did not join in the chatter, whenever his name was brought into the story he soon grumbled something about ‘exaggerating’ or ‘stupid’ or whatever name he thought Niall suited most at that moment in the story. Niall found the insults amusing and chuckled to himself whenever Karl offered a new one. They had a strong bond, Ayda could see that, they had grown up together and joined the Fiends together. They were brothers in life if not by blood. Ayda called Elle over to her. The young elf rose obediently from her place by the fire and settled in with the leaves and blankets of her make shift bed.‘When you want to talk to me, you can.’ Ayda whispered to her, stroking her sister’s long curls. ‘But rest for now, we have a long way to go.’ Elle closed her eyes to give the illusion of sleep, Ayda knew she was not likely to get any sleep tonight, they had lost their Father, Mother and Home in less than a day. They had also lost the love of their country. Nothing in their upbringing prepared them for this and now they were blind in the dark, surrounded by humans they hardly knew except for some distant childhood memory. Ayda had no idea what to do. She needed answers and Elle could give her them. Her patience was running thin and the responsibility was bearing down on her. Standing, she re-joined the others by the fire ensuring she was facing the exact spot her sister lay.‘What is the plan when we get to the wastes?’ Niall asked quietly, his eyes on Ayda.Ayda shook her head, ‘I don’t know. I just want her away from here.’‘Is that for the best? All the Guards in the Castle were dead, someone must have helped her, and how was that Castle brought down?’ Niall pointed out. She hadn’t thought of that. If she and Elle were so alone how on earth did fifty or so Guards die in that Castle and who did destroy the Castle? Elle certainly wasn’t capable of that.‘Elle told me something the other night, something happened to her during the Ritual.’ Ayda replied.‘During the Ritual? Was she spoken to?!’ Syren said excitedly.‘I think so, she just said she was scared. I didn’t really understand what she’d fear.’ Ayda shrugged looking at Syren. Niall, Theo and Karl looked confused.‘Excuse me, but what the hell is the Ritual?’ Niall asked, looking at them with interest.‘Did she say why she was scared? Do you have any ideas?’ Syren asked Ayda, ignoring him.‘She wanted to tell me, I know she did, but my Father warned her not to, I think.’ Ayda rubbed her temple trying to remember every detail of the night. She was so exhausted, her legs and back aching from riding.‘I can’t believe the Elders spoke to her. Her first Ritual.’ Syren said quietly in disbelief.‘WHAT IS THE RITUAL?’ Niall snapped, looking at them furiously.‘Like we’d tell –’ Syren snapped back, but Ayda had already began explaining.‘The Ritual is a tradition in Myrliar. For centuries our Elders select those of us they deem worthy and summon them to the Ritual.’‘Why?’ Niall asked, still glaring at Syren.‘Those who receive summons meet in the Ritual Chamber beneath the Castle as a way of respect. It is a great honour.’ Ayda finished.‘That’s stupid.’ Niall grunted, disappointed. Karl laughed.‘It’s not stupid!’ Ayda sparked up, ‘My Mother, Father and Elle were all summoned to commune with the Elders!”‘Not you?’ Niall pointed out quickly. Damn him, Ayda thought angrily.‘No, not me.’ Ayda said more to herself than anyone else.‘That’s why it’s stupid. You’re the eldest Princess, the Heir to the Throne and yet they summon Elle and not you? Why? What have you done?’ Niall accused. It hurt. Ayda stood up, she was wrong to have trusted these humans with this knowledge she should have kept it to herself. They were never going to understand the importance of their ways. He had asked her the question she had punished herself with for years and she was not telling anyone that answer. That was her pain, her mistake and her regret.‘She doesn’t need to explain herself to a human!’ Syren spat angrily, standing up in Ayda’s defence.‘And what actually happens in this chamber?!’ Niall continued ignoring Syren.‘We don’t know – we don’t go in do we?’ Syren hissed. Ayda ignored him, her heart aching under the heavy strain of loss and emptiness, she curled up next to Elle and listened whilst Syren and Niall continued to bicker until Theo stepped in to end it. Ayda watched her young sister and wondered how much she had heard, she looked as though she was contentedly sleeping, but she knew better, neither of them would sleep well tonight.She was running, she had never run so fast in her life. Niall was there running with her, Syren ahead of her with Theo and Karl behind. They were screaming for Elle. Elle? She thought desperately, where are you? No?! Ayda was shouting with them and running, her legs were screaming with pain, but she ignored them she had to find Elle. Elle! She called desperately, hysteria rising. Her friends were now running of into the distance, her body cried out as she pushed herself to catch up. She heard cries of pain and shouts ahead, her friends needed her! She was running so fast now, she couldn’t see them, she called their names whilst still searching for Elle. Her breathing was harsh and quick, panic was setting in. She stopped, spinning around on the spot she cried out desperately. It was going to catch her, she could hear it behind her, approaching fast. Where were they?! She screamed as something tapped her on the shoulder, she spun around and saw Elle stood there, blood down the front of her nightdress.‘I’m sorry Ayda.’ She cried, tears running down her face, ‘it’s all my fault!’. Ayda felt a jolt and someone calling her name, Theo? She looked around for him, turning back, Brielle had disappeared, she opened her eyes.‘Sorry Ayda, you were being quite loud, but we need to get going now.’ Theo said kindly as he gently shook her awake. Her heart was hammering against her ribs and her breathing was shallow. She sighed, she knew she wasn’t going to get a good couple of hours sleep and they had a long day ahead of them, she didn’t need nightmares disturbing her sleeping moments and her thoughts haunting her when awake. Rubbing her eyes, she began to pack up the blankets, attaching the previous owners’ saddlebag she spotted Elle with the horses.‘Morning,’ She greeted her sister.‘Ayda I –’ Elle began.‘Good Morning! I have brought you some clean clothes!’ Niall announced, oblivious to the interruption. ‘Well not new, I have borrowed them for our good cause.’ He chuckled to himself as he held up some cream linen tunic and green trousers for Elle. He grinned broadly, clearly pleased with himself for finding them. Elle took the clothes from him with a small ‘thanks’ and disappeared to change.‘Great. Just great.’ Ayda uttered.‘What?’ Niall said aghast, ‘What have I done now?’‘She was about to talk to me!’ Ayda replied angrily.‘I – I’m sorry! I didn’t realise!’ He spluttered, ‘I just wanted to help!’‘Don’t you always!’ Ayda hissed before storming back to the camp to check on everyone.That stupid man, she thought. Elle could have been about to tell her something important, an answer to a question and he interrupted. And for what? Some farm boy’s outfit? She caught sight of Elle with Syren, who was plaiting her hair in a similar fashion to her own, so it wasn’t in the way. Ayda walked over to them. Elle looked up at her. She looked lost, lost in her own thoughts and memories. No doubt haunted by the events that have terrified her. Ayda could see she was going to need more time than they had.‘Elle, what happened yesterday?’ Ayda asked softly, taking her hand and leading her over to their horse. The Princess looked up at her and shook her head.‘I’m scared Ayda, you should have left me there.’ Elle whispered sadly. Solemnly, without another word Elle mounted the horse without help and waited for Ayda to climb on behind her. Once everyone was seated they moved.‘I would never have left you there.’ Ayda said firmly into Brielle’s ear. Brielle said nothing further, she sighed and gazed ahead. The companions pressed forwards. The sun was not yet up but they could see. Theo and Karl had gone to great efforts to ensure that the camp and fire were cleared and that there was nothing remaining to track. Ayda could only hope it was enough. The night’s rest had done its job. The horses were refreshed, and the riders were stronger and more cheerful. Niall and his friends were continuing their long prose, Ayda found it surprising how much the three of them had to discuss. Ayda and Elle however, were not much changed. Brielle was still silent, apparently Niall and Theo’s jokes and games were not enough to bring her out of her stupor which was not surprising as Syren found them downright annoying.‘Are we really going to have to put up with them?’ Syren muttered to Ayda in passing, ducking as Niall attempted to poke her with a stick aimed for her cheek.‘With the rest of you all miserable it’s our duty to provide some relief!’ Niall said mockingly, poking Theo in the arm with his treasured stick and winking at Elle. Ayda had to admit, watching the men chasing each other with sticks and occasionally racing and play jousting was quite amusing. She appreciated the gesture. At first, she was as annoyed as Syren, but she realised they were acting up to try and ease Elle out of her despair. A few times Niall and Theo attempted to get Elle involved by poking her or asking for her favours before ‘battle’, Elle participated, but begrudgingly. The journey through the forest was uneventful, Ayda found herself treasuring the moments of peace knowing that they were surely not meant to last. Watching Niall and Theo had loosened the weights around her heart and she felt lighter, more hopeful, but she could not rid herself of the nagging worry clinging onto her with sharp claws. Elle still had not stirred, the little Princess at the Castle would have revelled in the games of these two Fiends, but she seemed uninterested. Ayda knew that whatever her concerns were, Elle was hiding something dark, deep within her soul and she had to help her, she had to share the burden that was eating away at her childhood. At last, by late morning they reached the edge of the forest. Ahead of them were lush green fields spread miles ahead of them, canvassing the land all around them. Niall let out a long whistle.‘It’s going to be hard to hide out there.’ He said.‘Well what do you suggest? There’s no other way to the wastes.’ Ayda replied.‘The River Myr?’ Theo asked, looking to Karl.‘We could follow the River north, but it will take longer, and they will most likely be watching the bridges.’ Karl agreed, rubbing his chin. Ayda was perplexed, the Wastes had felt like the safest place because no one ever travelled there. There was no green, no water and it was almost uninhabitable except for a small abandoned village. Ayda had forgotten that the journey there was going to be difficult to make undetected. She had no idea who she could trust. Even the people who greeted her with such enthusiasm on their Royal Progress could now be her enemy, she had to be smart and find a way around. Looking over the landscape ahead of her she took in the beauty of her country. The edge of the forest was a top a slight hill, she was lucky to have the vantage of looking down and plotting a course. She spied several small white stone settlements spotted over the fields, they would need to avoid those. Finally, she came up with a plan.‘From here we can see miles around us,’ She said clearly, ‘I suggest we move from high ground to high ground, there are several small hillsides where we can scour the landscape for the safest route. We should be able to see an army or hunting party from these.’ She pointed out the mounds of earth she was aiming for. The other’s nodded.‘It seems like a plan where a lot could go wrong, but I don’t see another option.’ Niall responded thoughtfully.‘It’s the best we’ve got.’ Theo agreed.‘In that case, I’ll meet you at the first one.’ Syren said, turning her horse away.‘What do you mean? Where are you going?’ Ayda turned to face her.‘Right now, we are travelling blind, we have no idea where our enemies are, what they know or who they are,’ Syren replied, ‘I intend to find out.’‘How?’ Ayda asked, worried.‘Inns and Taverns are always the best place for gossip.’ Niall explained. Syren nodded in agreement.‘Can I come?’ Niall asked eagerly.‘No.’‘I won’t get in your way, I’d just, um… have a drink?’‘No. Even if I wanted you with me you’d only be killed on sight.’ Syren ended the conversation impatiently. Bidding farewell to the Princesses she rode down the hill, Ayda watched as she hid her blades and placed her hood over her hair and made in the direction of the closest Town. Please get back safely, Ayda prayed.‘I think she’s starting to like me,’ Niall said happily, ‘she wouldn’t have even considered me before, now she’s concerned for my wellbeing.’‘I don’t think that’s what she was getting at mate,’ Theo thumped Niall’s shoulder laughing. Karl shook his head smirking at them. Kicking her horse forward, Ayda led them on. Down the hillside they plodded away from the forest, out into the open, the sun was nearly at its peak, blazing warmth down upon them. Ayda couldn’t help feeling cold. She couldn’t help remembering the last time her closest friend disappeared to help her, only that time he didn’t return. She couldn’t even say or think of his name anymore. There were cuts born of guilt so deep in her heart they would never be removed. He had died for her. She desperately wished Syren wouldn’t join him. For miles around them, the fields were lush and green, wild flowers of all colours and sizes were blossoming in the sun, big ancient trees stood tall amidst saplings born years ago, branches and leaves from smaller trees straining to keep up. Ayda watched with her sister as hundreds of birds danced and pirouetted across the sky forming waves upon waves of wings glistening with the sun. On they rode, taking in the natural splendour of the fertile land around them. Even Niall and Theo were silent, soaking up the peace, relishing the warm afternoon sun on their cold faces. On they walked for the rest of the day, every so often one of the humans would leave them, circle back and then re-join the party to make sure they weren’t being followed. Ayda’s thoughts were with her friend, she hoped more than anything that Syren would return to her. She had lost too many loved ones, the dull ache of her parent’s death and the memory of her father’s lifeless body would haunt her for the rest of her life, she couldn’t bear to add Syren to the pain. They walked on all day with no problems or encounters, and as the sun began to set they were nearing the top of the view point they had decided to rest upon. There wasn’t as much cover as Ayda had hoped, finding a small cluster of trees she went about setting Elle’s bed whilst the others took advantage of the remaining light to scout the area and spot anyone approaching from the hillside.Slowly night took hold. It was a beautiful night, mild and clear. Excusing themselves from the conversation being held by Niall and Karl, Ayda and Elle lay on the soft grass watching the stars overhead. Ayda took comfort in the small pinpricks of light penetrating the deep black sea above them. They looked close but when she reached out to touch one they were out of reach. Ayda allowed her mind to wander as her little sister admired the moonlight that rained down on them. She had not had time to think in peace without the feeling of unease or ache from travelling in her muscles, the thoughts in her head were so jumbled and confusing, like little jigsaw pieces she hadn’t had time to fit into place. She decided to start at the beginning. The Ritual. What had scared Elle so much at the Ritual? She had been spoken to, Elle had told her that much, but she didn’t know what was said that scared her. Then there was the attack on her. Her own comrades and Soldiers who she had trained with and fought with so many times, had turned on her. Betrayed her family, killed her Father and presumably her Mother and somehow succeeded in bringing down a centuries old Castle? She needed to know who had given these orders and whose authority was so absolute it went against the King himself. Who wanted her family killed – and why? Ayda knew that her little sister could probably provide the answers to most – if not all the questions, but her silence had continued all day.Ayda turned her head to look at her sister’s face. She could see long streams of glistening tears running down the Princesses face and getting lost in her blonde hair. She squeezed her hand in comfort.‘Do you think Mother and Father are up there?’ Elle whispered softly in her small girlish voice. Ayda looked up at the stars again. Pointing at the brightest one she replied,‘They are the brightest stars and always watching us.’ Ayda smiled slightly, taking comfort in the star that shone so brightly, Ayda realised that she was now watching the star and could see her Father smiling down on them. Suddenly she felt stronger, more able to do what she needed to do. He was watching them, and he would protect them.‘He died for me.’ Elle whispered sadly, the star reflecting brightly in her watery gaze.‘What do you mean?’ Ayda replied, holding her breath.‘The bad man wanted me, but Father wouldn’t let him.’‘What bad man? Wanted you why?’ Ayda sat up quickly, breathing fast she gave Elle time to reply.‘He-he was wearing a red cloak and gold mask. He tried to kill me.’ Elle said feebly.‘The Legion?!’ Ayda exclaimed flabbergasted. The Legion were the Guards of the Elders. They were very rarely seen as they usually stayed with their Masters. In fact, Ayda could not recall a time anyone had ever seen them, her Father nor Mother had ever seen them, they were only known to people through the teachings of the Scholars, many thought them a myth. Why would they want to kill Brielle? Why would the Elder’s want to kill Brielle? If this was true, what chance did they have against the most elite soldiers and the only mages left in the world?‘Elle, what scared you at the Ritual?’ She asked calmly, it would not do to let Elle see how worried she was. Elle sat up and shook her head slowly.‘Father said –’‘Father’s dead. If I’m going to protect you, I need to know everything,’ Ayda said firmly. She felt guilty for the words and for the tears brimming in her young sister’s eyes, but the truth was the truth and she had to know what the Princess knew, their lives depended on finding out why they were being hunted.‘I heard a woman,’ Elle whispered almost inaudibly, as though keeping the secret from the air around them, ‘She told me to get out. She was scared.’‘This girl – she wasn’t an Elder?’ Ayda asked confused. Elle shook her head profusely. Great, Ayda thought, this didn’t answer any questions and just added to the list of things she didn’t know. So, who was the girl and why did she want to get Elle out of the Ritual Chamber, nothing made sense. The only connection she could see was the Elders, but she had no idea what to do about that, she couldn’t demand they speak with her. They both sat in silence, both trapped in their own thoughts. Both searching for answers to questions. Sometime after, Niall came and found them, and they returned to the camp and got ready for a rough night’s sleep.‘Did she tell you anything?’ Niall asked quietly after Ayda came back from settling Elle down for the night. Ayda started to answer when they heard a distinct crack of a twig. The four of them jumped up quickly, weapons drawn, Ayda’s eyes were straining to see ahead of them in the dark. Slowly and quietly they moved towards sleeping Elle.‘Who’s there?’ Niall asked loudly, even though he was trying his best to sound confident she could hear the nervous waiver in his voice.‘Stand down it’s only me.’ Replied a familiar voice. Syren had re-joined them. Ayda breathed a silent sigh of relief. She was back. She was safe. Well safer.‘How did you know where we were?’ Niall spat, cursing her for making him jump.‘I didn’t, I’ve been wandering this hilltop for a while, it was only when I heard you that I knew where you were.’ Syren said quietly.‘Did anyone follow you?’ Karl asked gruffly.‘No and I’m fine thank you for asking.’ Syren said impatiently. Ayda clapped her on the shoulder.‘Good to see you,’ Ayda said gently, ‘Any news?’ The five of them sat down again not far from Elle. Syren started rummaging around in a bag and pulled out a loaf of bread, some fruit and cold meats. The others groaned thanks as they tucked in to the meal. Ayda had only just noticed the ache of hunger in the pit of her stomach and went to give Elle some of the food before returning to the small but merry feast. They hadn’t eaten much all day, just occasional fruit they picked going through the fields.‘I took the liberty of getting some food for the journey, but we’ll have to ration it, I couldn’t take too much without arousing suspicion.’ Syren said through a mouthful of hard bread. They ate in silence, each relishing every mouthful until the food in front of them was devoured.‘The Stone City has fallen.’ Syren said bitterly. Ayda looked at her and waited for her to continue. ‘The attack on the Stone City is the talk of the village. It is rumoured that the Legion have pulled out everyone from their homes looking for Elle. There are also scouts searching for you.’‘What of my people?’ Ayda asked. She remembered the times when her family would go on progress through Myrliar, her people were always so happy to see them, they would throw flowers and sing songs of love and peace, she had forgotten that in this struggle for power, everyone would be affected.‘The Legion have turned people out on the streets and forbidden anyone to aid you. Some have come out to support you and have been flayed for it. Young girls have been taken from their parents and examined to make sure they’re not your sister. Families that resist or hinder any search are killed on the spot.’ Syren said all this quickly as if to rid herself of the taste of it on her tongue. Ayda could not bear to think of the families being torn apart and all the blood shed on the white stone floors of her City.‘Who oversees Myrliar now?’ Ayda asked with a heavy heart.‘The Captain of the Legion apparently.’ Syren replied.‘Why have they done this? Why have they overturned my family, ours was a reign of peace!’ Ayda fumed, her blood boiling, the injustice and terror of everything that had happened to her family and country were too much to bear, and she was still no closer to getting any answers.‘The Legion are controlled by the Elders you say?’ Niall asked quietly.‘Yes, they are sworn guardians of the Elders.’ Ayda nodded.‘And the Ritual connects you Elves with the Elders?’ He asked. Ayda nodded again, curious.‘So, if Elle was scared after the Ritual, maybe she saw something she wasn’t meant to?’ Niall suggested, palms open in offering.‘And the girl telling Elle to get out?’ Ayda asked hopefully. Syren’s confused face looked between them, and Ayda brought her up to speed on what Elle had shared.‘The girl warned her, she knew the Elders would find out?’ Niall said, unsure of his own thoughts. Ayda had come to the same theory in her mind. The secret seemed to lay with Elle, but she was sure her sister had now told her everything.‘How on earth did someone communicate with Elle telepathically?’ Syren asked, bewildered.Ayda had been asking herself the same question. She had heard of this skill before, but no one had the power to do it for centuries.‘Magic.’ Came a quiet voice, Elle had woken and sat next to them without anyone realising.‘Impossible.’ Ayda said rather too quickly, slightly concerned that the young girl had gotten to them without any of them hearing anything.Niall laughed, ‘Magic? Are you serious?’‘You humans have never had magic?’ Syren asked curiously.‘No, never.’ Theo snorted, unsure whether it was a joke.‘Elves and Humans possessed powerful magic thousands of years ago, but through blood lines over time, it dwindled out, no one has ever seen, possessed or practised magic in centuries,’ Ayda told them, ‘We were brought up on history over the years, mages were present on both sides in the Great War that engulfed our people.’‘The Ritual is believed to be a chance for Elves to regain their magic and knowledge through communing with the Elders.’ Elle added, Syren was shaking her head at Ayda, she still didn’t trust the humans with the secrets of Myrliar. In the distance a howl could be heard, ghost like and clear as the stars above. It didn’t sound very close, so the companions took it as a cue to get some rest, with Karl on first watch. Ayda curled up once again around her sister, ready for fitful sleep.‘Ayda, Ayda...’Ayda shrugged off the hands that were annoying her, she couldn’t have been asleep that long. Just a little longer, there was another day of travelling ahead and she was still aching from the day before.She drifted back off to sleep. A sharp pain in the leg woke her and she cried out loud as she awoke.‘What the hell –’ She began to shout, but someone put a hand over her mouth, she struggled against them, not being completely awake she panicked, until she saw Elle just in front of her urging her to quiet down.‘Will you shut up?’ Niall spat in her ear. She nodded furiously, and he let her go.‘The howling is closer, we think the wolves are near our campsite.’ Syren explained coolly. Ayda sighed, there goes their night’s rest.‘Elle get up a tree, will you?’ Ayda said to her sister pointing at the closest one.‘Good idea. Princess, go on.’ Theo pushed her gently. With some help from the other’s Elle managed to shimmy up the tree and behind the leaves, out of sight. Ayda relaxed a little, the wolves would never get her up there, shame they weren’t built for more people. The howling sent goosebumps up her back. The hairs all over her body stood tall and alert. She was very aware of the sudden drop in temperature, as her lungs filled with ice and her breath caught in her chest. Ayda saw the others in front of her, circling her with their weapons raised. Karl with his broadsword stood like a giant over the others, Theo and Syren with their twin swords poised and Niall with his sword loosely at his side. Ayda unsheathed her own sword, she had taken down wolves before on Patrol, this shouldn’t be too difficult she reasoned calming herself. Unless there’s too many. The howling grew closer, they were nearly upon them. Something didn’t feel right, Ayda thought, the other’s in front were nervously looking around, their breath fogging in the moonlight. They had all encountered wolves before, but the growl of these wolves was, ghostly. A gritty, rough growling sounded all around them, glass twinkling through the dark.They were here. Ayda prepared her sword, and held it outstretched in front of her as the wolves ripped through the undergrowth. Several of her allies cursed loudly as they saw what was tearing towards them. A flash of silver fur and red eyes approached as wolves the size of lions hurtled towards them, growling in anticipation. Ayda watched in horror as one of the monsters leapt at her red-haired friend, who neatly rolled over to slice its underbelly as it flew overhead. Ayda had to admire her friend’s skill. The wolf, though hurt, did not stop there, it flew at her snapping at her as Syren pummelled it repeatedly with her blades. These were not normal wolves Ayda realised. Their silver fur was glowing in the moonlight and their red eyes were filled with an all-consuming bloodlust. Ayda jumped in to stab the monster repeatedly, together Ayda and Syren finished it off, just as another appeared growling. Ayda turned and saw four wolves attacking the humans. Niall, Theo and Karl were impressive, each one fluent in their dance, each of them understanding the other, when one struck, the other defended. As Karl landed a killing blow across the throat of a monster, Niall smacked another in the head to block its attack. The wolves were strong, and had razor sharp teeth and claws, but they were slow, they had to use this to their advantage. On and on they fought together, the five of them huddled as close together as possible, their resolve frightening, as they roared louder than the wolves. More and more wolves approached.‘We – can’t – keep this – going – forever!’ Syren screamed breathlessly as she slid her blade into the roof of a wolf’s mouth. ‘Aargh!’ She cried with pain, Ayda looked around and saw blood seeping from a fresh slice in her friend’s arm. The allies were all sporting their own cuts and wounds, they were slowly being ripped apart, and they would not last much longer before they tired from the onslaught of monsters. A thud on the ground shook her as she watched Theo fall backwards crying in pain, clutching his leg, Ayda saw a nasty bite mark shedding blood beneath his linens, he cursed loudly. Niall hacked off the wolf’s head with several blows, spilling blackened blood on the ground before returning with Karl to defend their brother. Time was running out, they were one down, Ayda was sure soon others would fall. Jumping aside Ayda timed a perfect hit as she slashed the side of a wolf. Too late, she realised she had pushed herself into the path of another that had thrown itself at her. Her chest felt as though it had been crushed under a pile of rock, claws were digging into her shoulders as the beast pressed her into the ground. Its teeth were mere inches from her skin gnashing together waiting for the taste of her blood. Using all her strength she pushed the wolf away from her, it was no use, it was too strong.‘Ayda!’ Niall bellowed. She heard the shouts of her friends around her, daring a look she could see they would never get to her in time, they were still struggling with their own beasts. She pushed with all her remaining strength, struggling to keep the teeth from her throat, the wolf thrashing around snapping its jaws angrily. Struggling she realised she was losing. A high-pitched shriek sounded across the hill. The world around her flashed a brilliant red and yellow, as flames scorched the air, Ayda strained a look above her. What she saw stopped her heart. Elle had climbed down from the tree to aid them, her arms were stretched wide and strings of flames were firing from her hands, white hot and blazing, snaking their way around the wolves before her. One by one the wolves howled in pain. The smell of burning flesh reached Ayda as the flames burnt holes like snakes through their bodies. Some fled but did not get far before Elle’s flames torched them into ash. Ayda wept as she watched her little sister’s face, grim determination was sketched across every feature. Her eyes were black and strained. She looked older, so much older. The wolf bearing down on Ayda burned internally and collapsed onto Ayda, who with her last breath looked at Elle and realised with shock, her sister was a Mage.",

      "content": "8 – ELLEThe fire had roared through her very soul, fed by her fear and anger as she stood watching her sister flailing beneath the silver beast. The world had burnt away. She had focussed every grain of her power on finishing the creatures who threatened her friends. Her whole body was shaking as her power ebbed, and slowly she fell to her knees, weakened and exhausted. The fire dissipated as quickly as it was conjured. Brielle watched as Niall, Karl and Syren heaved the great silver beast off her sister and dragged her closer to the trees. Ayda was unconscious, Elle felt a shiver of cold sweep through as she crawled on her hands and knees to her side. Taking her sister’s hand, she pleaded weakly for her to come back to her. She could feel the other’s watching her, fearing her. Niall and Karl moved away to help Theo limp over to them, where they bandaged up the bite on his leg.‘You could have blasted them before I got bitten you know,’ Theo laughed weakly, winking at her. He couldn’t hide his pain, he winced as Karl tightened the bandage around his wound. They sat in silence for a short while, each recovering from the fight and the display of power they had witnessed.‘You were almost a waste of rations there my old friend!’ Niall laughed, patting Theo on the leg. Elle couldn’t take her eyes off Ayda. She was the only family she had left. Theo was right, she should have helped them earlier, but she was so afraid. She could hardly remember the last time she used magic, all she could remember was the darkness and pain. Would Ayda still love her if she knew this was all her fault?‘You should’ve told me.’ Ayda said weakly. Elle’s heart skipped a beat as she saw her sister’s eyes open slowly, she jumped in and hugged her tight.‘I’m sorry.’ Elle whimpered, crying into her sister’s clothes. Ayda sat up against the tree and surveyed the landscape, the sun was on its way. The wolves had disappeared.‘I guess now we know why the Elders are after you.’ Niall said, sitting down next to Ayda. Ayda sighed, she was out of her depth, she had no idea how to deal with magic.‘But, we haven’t seen magic in centuries, surely the Elders would be glad to see it back?’ Syren said. Elle thought back to the attack at the Castle, painfully she remembered her Father using magic to the surprise of everyone else. She wasn’t the first to have magic, there must be others too. Something else bubbled to the surface of her memory.‘The Legion said something about breaking rules and that no-one is allowed magic.’ Elle informed them, as the memory appeared clear in her mind.‘I guess they’re not pleased then.’ Niall said gruffly, rubbing his temple.‘Elle, I can’t believe you didn’t tell us this earlier, this changes things.’ Ayda repeated with slight annoyance in her tone. Brielle winced at the underlying tone. She had wanted to tell her sister. Desperately. But with everything else that had happened she didn’t know what to do. It felt like she was living in a nightmare, she found herself hoping that she would wake up soon and be looking forward to playing with her friends in the Castle Gardens. Every time she thought about the beautiful Castle and Gardens and her dear friends her heart clenched tightly. They were gone, it was all gone, she had destroyed it all. Not the Legion, not the Elders. Her. She had pleaded with her mind to forget her Father, Mother, Amie and her friends. But no matter how she locked them away in her mind, they were still forever heavy in her heart.‘Princess, what exactly can you do with this power of yours?’ Theo asked kindly, placing his hand on her arm as he leaned over from his resting spot beside them. His leg was cleaned and wrapped firmly in bandages, she was relieved to see he seemed to be getting over the shock.‘I - I don’t know,’ Elle answered shyly. ‘I have only done it twice, and I don’t ever remember deciding to. It just happens.’‘Try something now.’ Theo urged enthusiastically. Ayda nodded. Brielle was unsure. She wasn’t confident it worked like that. Everything that had happened had just happened, she hadn’t been aware of releasing her magic, or forming it, it had just appeared. And destroyed. Elle was conscious that both times her magic had exploded, death and destruction blossomed. She had destroyed their home and killed most of its residents and she had almost set fire to this forest. Refusing their request, she took in the look of their faces. They were all dirty and tired, most now had skin hidden beneath cuts and grazes but beyond that, in each of them she saw a deep fear. They were afraid of her, she guessed. Before, they were protecting a little girl, a Princess, now they were travelling with a Mage of unknown strength and control. Something that none of them had even known possible.‘What happened the first time Elle?’ Ayda asked gently, as if she knew this was the cause of the girl’s pain. Elle closed her eyes, she had to tell them the truth, they were risking their lives by helping her, she owed it to them. She didn’t want to, she couldn’t bear it again. Taking a deep breath, she started her story. The words flowed easily once she started, it felt like a relief being able to share the weight of her anchor with her friends. They listened intently, when she revealed her Father’s use of magic, Ayda had lowered her head into her hands, but not before Elle saw sorrow exchange for anger. When she reached the end of the tale, a few long sighs were heard. They sat in silence for a long while, each contemplating what had just been said.‘Niall, we’re in over our heads here,’ Karl stated firmly, ‘I can’t fight magic, if I hadn’t just seen it I would have laughed at the idea of it. We don’t need to be here.’‘So, you’re just going to leave?’ Syren said hotly.‘You have to understand, we have never even heard of magic before this, it’s a lot to take in.’ Theo soothed.‘There were human Mages too, you know!’ Syren replied.‘Not that we know of. How do you know?’‘Do you know nothing of the history of our two people?’ Syren spat.‘Well, a bit, we’ve been warring for centuries, heavy losses on both sides, because the Elves wanted our land.’ Theo said nervously, wavering under Syren’s glare.‘That’s NOT what it was about! You Humans constantly crossed the Myr River into our lands and attacked, raped and pillaged our people!’ Syren spat, her eyes were growing redder and redder in anger. Theo raised his hands in defeat, in his weakened state he didn’t have much energy to argue. Elle looked to her sister to step in, but her head was still down, and Niall was watching something in the distance, apparently unaware of the war brewing in their camp.‘Mages were conscripted into both armies, where they slaughtered each other, destroying Elven Land. Their numbers were so diminished that eventually their blood lines died out. The only Mages left were the Elders. Since there have been no more Elven Mages, and clearly no more Human Mages either.’ Syren informed them bluntly.‘We need to move.’ Ayda said, her head snapping back up. Without another word she wandered off into the trees in the direction of the horses. Syren followed with a backwards glare at the men left behind.‘Are you coming?’ Elle asked timidly.‘Princess, this is not our fight. I don’t know what we can do to help you – you just saved us!’ Theo said sadly shaking his head. Elle looked to Niall, she wanted them to stay. She felt sure that they would be needed, she was scared that Ayda and Syren would not be enough protection if her magic failed, and she didn’t have any confidence in it. She hated it, despised its flow in her veins, her father might still be alive, and her home would be standing if she wasn’t a Mage.‘Be honest with me Princess, you don’t think you can control it do you?’ Niall asked, rising to his feet, Elle stood with him and looked him in the eye. She knew that Syren disliked this man, she didn’t like the way he played the fool or his jokes, she didn’t trust him. Elle thought otherwise, she had watched him with her sister, the way he had followed her into the Castle, and screamed for her when she was hurt. He had been kind to Elle, trying to make her laugh and helping her with the horses and clean clothes. Brielle believed he was a kind and caring man hidden beneath bravado. It was something she noticed that her sister could not see.‘No. I’m scared I will fail and my sister will fall like my Father,’ Elle said truthfully, tears stinging her eyes. It was her worst fear, losing the last member of her family. Her cherished sister, the sister who had fought for her so many times. Niall nodded, understanding. He looked to the sky, the sun had appeared, a red hue was glowing in the landscape as morning began.‘I will come with you,’ He said firmly and confidently, taking the young Elf’s hand in his.‘Niall, what? This is ridiculous!’ Karl grunted in disbelief, ‘You’re risking our lives for Elves? Theo is already hurt, we need to go back!’‘You two go, if you wish, I’m needed here.’‘No. You will die. The Elf cannot even control her magic!’ Karl shouted, not believing what he was hearing.‘Precisely! Who will help them if her magic fails? Ayda and Syren will not be enough! And what of our people – our own heritage?’ Niall said loudly and clearly.‘Why do you care so much!?’ Silence followed, Niall didn’t so much as look at his friends. Theo broke the silence as he struggled to rise from his spot alone and catch his footing on the uneven ground. He nodded at Niall and ruffed Elle’s hair as he limped passed them, following Ayda to the horses. He was coming.‘Please Karl,’ Elle pleaded quietly. Karl growled to himself, he looked at the Princess and his harsh gaze softened. Brielle understood his fear, he didn’t know which was more likely to kill him first, the Legion, The Elder’s or her lack of control. He had been fighting all his life, but with magic as his adversary, he was lost. Defeated, he nodded and followed Theo. Niall looked down at Elle.‘See? We’re a good team,’ He winked at her. ‘I’m sorry for getting you all into this.’ Elle said.‘Do not be afraid to fail, failing makes you stronger. With me here you have nothing to fear!’ He smiled at her, gave her a squeeze and they followed on.Ayda had already started on her horse when they arrived so Brielle elected to sit astride Niall’s black stallion. He was a beautiful horse, with a glossy pure black coat and what were white socks had they not been covered in dirt and sludge from travelling. She was thankful that the wolves had not been interested in the horses, they had left them away from the camp for fear of detection, it was lucky they had, it would be a long way on foot. Brielle noticed her sister was not talking to anyone, not even her dearest friend, she guessed it was her fault. She shared her concerns with her co-rider.‘It’s a lot to take in, you were brought up on magical history stories with the knowledge that no more magic existed in your country. Then she finds out that her sister and her father both have magic and that the Elder’s you have worshipped for so long are hunting you,’ Niall explained softly.‘I shouldn’t have kept it from her.’ Elle whispered guiltily.‘Maybe, maybe not. I don’t blame you for that, and I’m sure she doesn’t. You’re so young, it’s cruel that this has happened to you.’ The group continued through the miles of fields, the sun was up now, radiating golden light upon the landscape. Elle watched as Ayda continued to lead at the front, not speaking to anyone. She was leading them north, towards the Wastes where she felt certain there would be no one to intercept her. The countryside was populated by farmers and a few small towns and villages, Ayda was giving each of them a wide berth, not knowing who friend or foe was, she could not risk anyone recognising them. It would be better to reach the wastes unnoticed, so they were harder to track. They had eaten on the move, Brielle had seen the look on Karl’s face when he was handed a pitifully small ration compared to the other’s, thankfully he didn’t complain aloud, merely grumbled as he popped it miserably into his mouth in one. Elle didn’t want to hear another shouting match between him and Syren, she felt there was so much more going on than their differences. She found herself longing for Ayda to speak to her, although Niall was fun and cheerful company, as he was telling her more stories about his childhood, Elle wished she could feel her sister’s warm words of encouragement. Noticing the dark cloud slowly shadowing Elle’s mood, Niall burst into song, joyfully mocking his friend’s pain.‘There once was a one-legged man,He fell off from his horse,He hopped, skipped and jumped,And wobbled when he dumped,All his friends were laughing,Theo is a one-legged man,His blades were overcome,The dog wanted meat,And got his smelly feet,Theo started howling,Niall is a very brave manHe saved his friend from death,He stabbed with his bladeAnd the dog did fadeA Knight in Armour Shining!’Brielle found his laughter contagious, throughout the song he could hardly keep us his performance through laughter as he saw the look of feigned hurt from Theo. By the end, the two of them were in fits of hysterics, Elle could not help but join in. For a wonderful fleeting moment, she felt light, she felt young and unencumbered. The memory of her Father was distant, the deep worry that ate at her was forgotten. She had forgotten that through the darkness that surrounded her at times of despair, her friends around her were beacons of hope. With them she felt stronger and happier. She glanced at Ayda and was relieved to see the smallest of smiles on her face and a flash of relief in her eyes. Her sister would never neglect her and never leave her, she was all she had left in the world. Together, they were a formidable team, they only had each other to lose and it would take a lot to tear them apart now.‘Thank you, Niall,’ Elle whispered to him, she felt him gently squeeze her. She was grateful to him for reminding her not to wallow in her self-pity, through his stories and those of his friends she could see that he was a loyal and fierce friend, which explained why his closest friends, Karl and Theo, had followed him all this way. Ayda was still indifferent to him, and Syren did everything she could to ignore the three of them. The hatred and resentment seemed to run deep in her veins. The young Princess knew that Humans and Elves naturally hated one another, due to the centuries of war that had ripped their world in two, but the hatred seemed so much more pronounced with Ayda and Syren. Elle could not bring herself to hate the three of them just for being human, they were risking their lives to help them. They were her friends, not her enemies.‘Your Country is so like ours, Princess,’ Theo said, pulling his horse back alongside Niall’s.‘In what way?’ Elle asked intrigued, she found herself wanting to visit their home, and see more of these people.‘The flowers, the animals, the land.’‘Are there any differences?’‘Yes of course, the people are different, your beliefs, your traditions, and your buildings are a funny shape.’ Theo winked at her.‘Do you not have Elders like us?’ Elle asked curiously.‘No, we have our Spirit God, but he only serves to advise King Devan, many of us don’t believe in him. I’ve never even seen a depiction of him.’ Theo explained briefly. Elle had heard of the human King. His Father and the Kings before him had a circle of advisors which worked similarly to their Monarchy in Myrliar. Her own Father had counsel from the Elders whereas King Devan received counsel from his advisors. His advisors were human, but rumour was there was a God at the Head of the Council that Kings always heeded. Many humans believed this a mere fabrication or superstition for no one had ever seen or heard this God.‘I don’t think the people are so different. We are all unique, but all the same.’ Elle said quietly to herself. He looked at her, his eyebrow raised in curiosity. ‘You love, you trust, you bleed, you believe, you hope,’ Elle explained, ‘I think we are not so different.’ Theo’s mouth opened in surprise, he ran his fingers through her hair and murmured softly.‘You are a special one, Princess. In all my years I have never heard such wisdom, especially in one so young.’‘The Princess is too young to know war,’ A dark voice called, Syren had been listening into their conversation, ‘when she has lost her whole family at the hands of humans she would feel the pain of the rest of us.’‘We have lost our family to war, yet the humans have had no hand in it.’ Ayda said clearly and loudly, stopping Syren in her tracks. Syren glared at Theo and Niall then quickly spurred her horse to the front next to Ayda.‘Don’t let her thoughts poison you, Princess, you have the greatest heart of all.’ Niall whispered in her ear.‘You do not like Elves either though?’ Elle asked.‘No, as a rule, like Syren, our lives have been torn apart by your people,’ Niall reasoned, ‘But I do not hate, just because one petal of the flower is bruised, does not mean the others are any less beautiful.’ Elle scrunched her face up trying to understand what he meant.‘He means to say, just because one Elf is bad, it is not to say they all are. You certainly aren’t.’ Theo explained. Elle liked that. She pictured the beautiful flowers in her room of the Castle. They were always so beautiful in bloom. Occasionally one would decay and rot, but the others were still pure and splendid, no matter their colour or size, they were each as perfect as the last. She heard the trickle of water underneath Niall and Theo’s conversation. It sounded as if a stream was nearby as they moved further north. She was suddenly very conscious of the stains of sweat and grime on her friend’s and her clothes. She pulled her tunic to her face. It was not the floral scent she was used to as a Princess. She noticed Syren had disappeared from up front, Ayda had pulled back to them.‘Syren has gone to find this water and make sure the way is clear.’ Ayda informed them.The other’s all smiled and nodded, Elle could see the prospect of a nice soak and wash to them was a blessing. The horses could also do with a water stop, they had not been able to spare much of their own supply. Moments later Syren reappeared from a cluster of trees not far from them.‘It’s a small lake, there’s a stream that comes from the mountains. There’s no one there.’ She said, not able to hide the excitement form her voice. Everyone looked at Ayda expectantly.‘Please Ayda.’ Elle begged.‘This is a place many people will travel to for rest.’ Ayda explained her doubts.‘We haven’t washed or bathed in days Ayda, we’ll all feel so much better for it.’ Niall said softly.‘And I’m pretty sure the Princess had blonde hair at one point!’ Theo jested, gently nudging Elle who smiled. Ayda nodded. Several whoops sounded from Niall and Theo. Kicking their horses back into action, the troupe moved quickly towards the small cluster of trees, Elle saw the small trickling stream and revelled in the sound. The water peacefully flowed over the rocks, and clear water glistened in the sunlight. As they reached the small lake, everyone’s moods lightened. Niall helped Elle from her saddle and then raced a limping Theo down to the lake where they both dived headfirst fully clothed.‘Oh, for goodness sake!’ Syren spat, ‘Be quiet, you’ll attract attention!’‘Sorry!’ Niall called over in a shouted whisper. The two of them were splashing around like boys playing in a river. Every now and then one of them would go under the water, reappear and drag the other under. Elle found herself giggling at them as she watched.‘Come over here Elle,’ Ayda summoned. She showed her a shallow section of water hidden behind an assortment of rocks, away from eyes where the young Princess could bathe in peace.‘I’ll wash your clothes,’ Syren offered, taking them as Elle shimmied into the water. Ayda sat against the rock, considering the trees that thinly surrounded the lake. The water was cool against Elle’s sore skin, the cuts and grazes stung slightly but soon numbed in the freshness of the water. Ducking her head into the depths, she began to run her fingers through her messy hair. She decided this was a good opportunity to talk to her sister.‘I’m sorry Ayda.’ Elle said quietly. Ayda sighed.‘It’s OK, it’s a lot to take in, but I understand.’ Elle busied herself washing out the vast amounts of curly, matted, hair. Without a brush she knew she was fighting a losing battle.‘You can’t control it can you?’ Ayda asked.‘No.’ Elle replied. The peacefulness she had felt at sitting in the cool calm lake and hearing the boys laughing and crying in happiness shattered at the thought of her magic.‘Have you tried?’‘No. Every time I have used magic, so many have died.’‘You must be strong, to bring down the castle,’ Ayda figured. Elle nodded. ‘Why did you?’‘Why did I what?’ Elle asked, staring absently into the water.‘Bring down the Castle.’‘I didn’t mean to! I was so angry, Father had just been killed, everything just kind of exploded!’ Elle said loudly, tears filled her eyes, she stood. The tension in her body snapped. She had been desperately trying to clean, trying to relax but she never could. She would never be rid of the horror of her magic. Her magic had been the cause of everything and she hated it. No matter how hard she scrubbed or how long she sat in that water, the magic would never go away. She had to live with it. Ayda wrapped her in the blanket used for sleeping at sat her on the smoothest rocks.‘I’m sorry, don’t be upset, I’m just trying to understand.’ Ayda cooed.‘I hate it Ayda!’ Elle wailed, ‘My magic has destroyed everything! Mother and Father would be alive if the Elder’s didn’t want me!’ Elle felt the anger bubbling beneath her skin, why did no one understand? She was angry with her sister, she couldn’t just give her a few moments of peace without accusing her of choosing to destroy their home!‘I see the way you all look at me! As if I might explode and hurt you! You’re scared of me!’ She continued to shout, her temper getting the better of her. Ayda looked desperately at her sister and tried to calm her down.‘We’re not afraid of you we know you’d never hurt us!’‘You should be afraid! I’m afraid! You should have seen what I did!’ Flashbacks smashed into her brain and assaulted her presence on reality. Her anger spilled over the brim and she was aware of power developing in her chest. Her eyes firing with anger as she glared at her sister, unseeing, drowning in the pit of her anger, her fear. Brielle did not hear her sister beg her to stop and did not hear the other’s crying in pain. She remembered the pain she extracted from her Father’s betrayers. It was what she lived for. She was blind to everything around her, the power had seeped out from within her and was white hot with venom. Her heart was beating fast and her breathing was out of control.‘Elle, stop!’ Ayda screamed. She had never heard Ayda scream like that. The panic and soul shredding fear slapped her in the face. For the first time she could see. Ayda’s face was red hot and her eyes were streaming with tears.‘Elle, stop! Please!” Ayda cried out again. Elle felt her feet on the dirt. She looked around at the lake behind her, the sight she beheld was enough to pull her to her knees. The lake was bubbling and hissing, pillows of steam rose rapidly from the depths, looking closer she saw hundreds of charred fish floating lifelessly on the surface being pushed around by erupting bubbles. She had boiled the lake! She cried and begged for it to stop, but her magic kept coming, flowing through her veins. The lake was hissing furiously, angry bubbles frothing on the surface, steam spiralling high into the sky. Finally, exhausted, she fell shaking to the floor, in floods of warm tears.",

      "content": "8 – ELLEThe fire had roared through her very soul, fed by her fear and anger as she stood watching her sister flailing beneath the silver beast. The world had burnt away. She had focussed every grain of her power on finishing the creatures who threatened her friends. Her whole body was shaking as her power ebbed, and slowly she fell to her knees, weakened and exhausted. The fire dissipated as quickly as it was conjured. Brielle watched as Niall, Karl and Syren heaved the great silver beast off her sister and dragged her closer to the trees. Ayda was unconscious, Elle felt a shiver of cold sweep through as she crawled on her hands and knees to her side. Taking her sister’s hand, she pleaded weakly for her to come back to her. She could feel the other’s watching her, fearing her. Niall and Karl moved away to help Theo limp over to them, where they bandaged up the bite on his leg.‘You could have blasted them before I got bitten you know,’ Theo laughed weakly, winking at her. He couldn’t hide his pain, he winced as Karl tightened the bandage around his wound. They sat in silence for a short while, each recovering from the fight and the display of power they had witnessed.‘You were almost a waste of rations there my old friend!’ Niall laughed, patting Theo on the leg. Elle couldn’t take her eyes off Ayda. She was the only family she had left. Theo was right, she should have helped them earlier, but she was so afraid. She could hardly remember the last time she used magic, all she could remember was the darkness and pain. Would Ayda still love her if she knew this was all her fault?‘You should’ve told me.’ Ayda said weakly. Elle’s heart skipped a beat as she saw her sister’s eyes open slowly, she jumped in and hugged her tight.‘I’m sorry.’ Elle whimpered, crying into her sister’s clothes. Ayda sat up against the tree and surveyed the landscape, the sun was on its way. The wolves had disappeared.‘I guess now we know why the Elders are after you.’ Niall said, sitting down next to Ayda. Ayda sighed, she was out of her depth, she had no idea how to deal with magic.‘But, we haven’t seen magic in centuries, surely the Elders would be glad to see it back?’ Syren said. Elle thought back to the attack at the Castle, painfully she remembered her Father using magic to the surprise of everyone else. She wasn’t the first to have magic, there must be others too. Something else bubbled to the surface of her memory.‘The Legion said something about breaking rules and that no-one is allowed magic.’ Elle informed them, as the memory appeared clear in her mind.‘I guess they’re not pleased then.’ Niall said gruffly, rubbing his temple.‘Elle, I can’t believe you didn’t tell us this earlier, this changes things.’ Ayda repeated with slight annoyance in her tone. Brielle winced at the underlying tone. She had wanted to tell her sister. Desperately. But with everything else that had happened she didn’t know what to do. It felt like she was living in a nightmare, she found herself hoping that she would wake up soon and be looking forward to playing with her friends in the Castle Gardens. Every time she thought about the beautiful Castle and Gardens and her dear friends her heart clenched tightly. They were gone, it was all gone, she had destroyed it all. Not the Legion, not the Elders. Her. She had pleaded with her mind to forget her Father, Mother, Amie and her friends. But no matter how she locked them away in her mind, they were still forever heavy in her heart.‘Princess, what exactly can you do with this power of yours?’ Theo asked kindly, placing his hand on her arm as he leaned over from his resting spot beside them. His leg was cleaned and wrapped firmly in bandages, she was relieved to see he seemed to be getting over the shock.‘I - I don’t know,’ Elle answered shyly. ‘I have only done it twice, and I don’t ever remember deciding to. It just happens.’‘Try something now.’ Theo urged enthusiastically. Ayda nodded. Brielle was unsure. She wasn’t confident it worked like that. Everything that had happened had just happened, she hadn’t been aware of releasing her magic, or forming it, it had just appeared. And destroyed. Elle was conscious that both times her magic had exploded, death and destruction blossomed. She had destroyed their home and killed most of its residents and she had almost set fire to this forest. Refusing their request, she took in the look of their faces. They were all dirty and tired, most now had skin hidden beneath cuts and grazes but beyond that, in each of them she saw a deep fear. They were afraid of her, she guessed. Before, they were protecting a little girl, a Princess, now they were travelling with a Mage of unknown strength and control. Something that none of them had even known possible.‘What happened the first time Elle?’ Ayda asked gently, as if she knew this was the cause of the girl’s pain. Elle closed her eyes, she had to tell them the truth, they were risking their lives by helping her, she owed it to them. She didn’t want to, she couldn’t bear it again. Taking a deep breath, she started her story. The words flowed easily once she started, it felt like a relief being able to share the weight of her anchor with her friends. They listened intently, when she revealed her Father’s use of magic, Ayda had lowered her head into her hands, but not before Elle saw sorrow exchange for anger. When she reached the end of the tale, a few long sighs were heard. They sat in silence for a long while, each contemplating what had just been said.‘Niall, we’re in over our heads here,’ Karl stated firmly, ‘I can’t fight magic, if I hadn’t just seen it I would have laughed at the idea of it. We don’t need to be here.’‘So, you’re just going to leave?’ Syren said hotly.‘You have to understand, we have never even heard of magic before this, it’s a lot to take in.’ Theo soothed.‘There were human Mages too, you know!’ Syren replied.‘Not that we know of. How do you know?’‘Do you know nothing of the history of our two people?’ Syren spat.‘Well, a bit, we’ve been warring for centuries, heavy losses on both sides, because the Elves wanted our land.’ Theo said nervously, wavering under Syren’s glare.‘That’s NOT what it was about! You Humans constantly crossed the Myr River into our lands and attacked, raped and pillaged our people!’ Syren spat, her eyes were growing redder and redder in anger. Theo raised his hands in defeat, in his weakened state he didn’t have much energy to argue. Elle looked to her sister to step in, but her head was still down, and Niall was watching something in the distance, apparently unaware of the war brewing in their camp.‘Mages were conscripted into both armies, where they slaughtered each other, destroying Elven Land. Their numbers were so diminished that eventually their blood lines died out. The only Mages left were the Elders. Since there have been no more Elven Mages, and clearly no more Human Mages either.’ Syren informed them bluntly.‘We need to move.’ Ayda said, her head snapping back up. Without another word she wandered off into the trees in the direction of the horses. Syren followed with a backwards glare at the men left behind.‘Are you coming?’ Elle asked timidly.‘Princess, this is not our fight. I don’t know what we can do to help you – you just saved us!’ Theo said sadly shaking his head. Elle looked to Niall, she wanted them to stay. She felt sure that they would be needed, she was scared that Ayda and Syren would not be enough protection if her magic failed, and she didn’t have any confidence in it. She hated it, despised its flow in her veins, her father might still be alive, and her home would be standing if she wasn’t a Mage.‘Be honest with me Princess, you don’t think you can control it do you?’ Niall asked, rising to his feet, Elle stood with him and looked him in the eye. She knew that Syren disliked this man, she didn’t like the way he played the fool or his jokes, she didn’t trust him. Elle thought otherwise, she had watched him with her sister, the way he had followed her into the Castle, and screamed for her when she was hurt. He had been kind to Elle, trying to make her laugh and helping her with the horses and clean clothes. Brielle believed he was a kind and caring man hidden beneath bravado. It was something she noticed that her sister could not see.‘No. I’m scared I will fail and my sister will fall like my Father,’ Elle said truthfully, tears stinging her eyes. It was her worst fear, losing the last member of her family. Her cherished sister, the sister who had fought for her so many times. Niall nodded, understanding. He looked to the sky, the sun had appeared, a red hue was glowing in the landscape as morning began.‘I will come with you,’ He said firmly and confidently, taking the young Elf’s hand in his.‘Niall, what? This is ridiculous!’ Karl grunted in disbelief, ‘You’re risking our lives for Elves? Theo is already hurt, we need to go back!’‘You two go, if you wish, I’m needed here.’‘No. You will die. The Elf cannot even control her magic!’ Karl shouted, not believing what he was hearing.‘Precisely! Who will help them if her magic fails? Ayda and Syren will not be enough! And what of our people – our own heritage?’ Niall said loudly and clearly.‘Why do you care so much!?’ Silence followed, Niall didn’t so much as look at his friends. Theo broke the silence as he struggled to rise from his spot alone and catch his footing on the uneven ground. He nodded at Niall and ruffed Elle’s hair as he limped passed them, following Ayda to the horses. He was coming.‘Please Karl,’ Elle pleaded quietly. Karl growled to himself, he looked at the Princess and his harsh gaze softened. Brielle understood his fear, he didn’t know which was more likely to kill him first, the Legion, The Elder’s or her lack of control. He had been fighting all his life, but with magic as his adversary, he was lost. Defeated, he nodded and followed Theo. Niall looked down at Elle.‘See? We’re a good team,’ He winked at her. ‘I’m sorry for getting you all into this.’ Elle said.‘Do not be afraid to fail, failing makes you stronger. With me here you have nothing to fear!’ He smiled at her, gave her a squeeze and they followed on.Ayda had already started on her horse when they arrived so Brielle elected to sit astride Niall’s black stallion. He was a beautiful horse, with a glossy pure black coat and what were white socks had they not been covered in dirt and sludge from travelling. She was thankful that the wolves had not been interested in the horses, they had left them away from the camp for fear of detection, it was lucky they had, it would be a long way on foot. Brielle noticed her sister was not talking to anyone, not even her dearest friend, she guessed it was her fault. She shared her concerns with her co-rider.‘It’s a lot to take in, you were brought up on magical history stories with the knowledge that no more magic existed in your country. Then she finds out that her sister and her father both have magic and that the Elder’s you have worshipped for so long are hunting you,’ Niall explained softly.‘I shouldn’t have kept it from her.’ Elle whispered guiltily.‘Maybe, maybe not. I don’t blame you for that, and I’m sure she doesn’t. You’re so young, it’s cruel that this has happened to you.’ The group continued through the miles of fields, the sun was up now, radiating golden light upon the landscape. Elle watched as Ayda continued to lead at the front, not speaking to anyone. She was leading them north, towards the Wastes where she felt certain there would be no one to intercept her. The countryside was populated by farmers and a few small towns and villages, Ayda was giving each of them a wide berth, not knowing who friend or foe was, she could not risk anyone recognising them. It would be better to reach the wastes unnoticed, so they were harder to track. They had eaten on the move, Brielle had seen the look on Karl’s face when he was handed a pitifully small ration compared to the other’s, thankfully he didn’t complain aloud, merely grumbled as he popped it miserably into his mouth in one. Elle didn’t want to hear another shouting match between him and Syren, she felt there was so much more going on than their differences. She found herself longing for Ayda to speak to her, although Niall was fun and cheerful company, as he was telling her more stories about his childhood, Elle wished she could feel her sister’s warm words of encouragement. Noticing the dark cloud slowly shadowing Elle’s mood, Niall burst into song, joyfully mocking his friend’s pain.‘There once was a one-legged man,He fell off from his horse,He hopped, skipped and jumped,And wobbled when he dumped,All his friends were laughing,Theo is a one-legged man,His blades were overcome,The dog wanted meat,And got his smelly feet,Theo started howling,Niall is a very brave manHe saved his friend from death,He stabbed with his bladeAnd the dog did fadeA Knight in Armour Shining!’Brielle found his laughter contagious, throughout the song he could hardly keep us his performance through laughter as he saw the look of feigned hurt from Theo. By the end, the two of them were in fits of hysterics, Elle could not help but join in. For a wonderful fleeting moment, she felt light, she felt young and unencumbered. The memory of her Father was distant, the deep worry that ate at her was forgotten. She had forgotten that through the darkness that surrounded her at times of despair, her friends around her were beacons of hope. With them she felt stronger and happier. She glanced at Ayda and was relieved to see the smallest of smiles on her face and a flash of relief in her eyes. Her sister would never neglect her and never leave her, she was all she had left in the world. Together, they were a formidable team, they only had each other to lose and it would take a lot to tear them apart now.‘Thank you, Niall,’ Elle whispered to him, she felt him gently squeeze her. She was grateful to him for reminding her not to wallow in her self-pity, through his stories and those of his friends she could see that he was a loyal and fierce friend, which explained why his closest friends, Karl and Theo, had followed him all this way. Ayda was still indifferent to him, and Syren did everything she could to ignore the three of them. The hatred and resentment seemed to run deep in her veins. The young Princess knew that Humans and Elves naturally hated one another, due to the centuries of war that had ripped their world in two, but the hatred seemed so much more pronounced with Ayda and Syren. Elle could not bring herself to hate the three of them just for being human, they were risking their lives to help them. They were her friends, not her enemies.‘Your Country is so like ours, Princess,’ Theo said, pulling his horse back alongside Niall’s.‘In what way?’ Elle asked intrigued, she found herself wanting to visit their home, and see more of these people.‘The flowers, the animals, the land.’‘Are there any differences?’‘Yes of course, the people are different, your beliefs, your traditions, and your buildings are a funny shape.’ Theo winked at her.‘Do you not have Elders like us?’ Elle asked curiously.‘No, we have our Spirit God, but he only serves to advise King Devan, many of us don’t believe in him. I’ve never even seen a depiction of him.’ Theo explained briefly. Elle had heard of the human King. His Father and the Kings before him had a circle of advisors which worked similarly to their Monarchy in Myrliar. Her own Father had counsel from the Elders whereas King Devan received counsel from his advisors. His advisors were human, but rumour was there was a God at the Head of the Council that Kings always heeded. Many humans believed this a mere fabrication or superstition for no one had ever seen or heard this God.‘I don’t think the people are so different. We are all unique, but all the same.’ Elle said quietly to herself. He looked at her, his eyebrow raised in curiosity. ‘You love, you trust, you bleed, you believe, you hope,’ Elle explained, ‘I think we are not so different.’ Theo’s mouth opened in surprise, he ran his fingers through her hair and murmured softly.‘You are a special one, Princess. In all my years I have never heard such wisdom, especially in one so young.’‘The Princess is too young to know war,’ A dark voice called, Syren had been listening into their conversation, ‘when she has lost her whole family at the hands of humans she would feel the pain of the rest of us.’‘We have lost our family to war, yet the humans have had no hand in it.’ Ayda said clearly and loudly, stopping Syren in her tracks. Syren glared at Theo and Niall then quickly spurred her horse to the front next to Ayda.‘Don’t let her thoughts poison you, Princess, you have the greatest heart of all.’ Niall whispered in her ear.‘You do not like Elves either though?’ Elle asked.‘No, as a rule, like Syren, our lives have been torn apart by your people,’ Niall reasoned, ‘But I do not hate, just because one petal of the flower is bruised, does not mean the others are any less beautiful.’ Elle scrunched her face up trying to understand what he meant.‘He means to say, just because one Elf is bad, it is not to say they all are. You certainly aren’t.’ Theo explained. Elle liked that. She pictured the beautiful flowers in her room of the Castle. They were always so beautiful in bloom. Occasionally one would decay and rot, but the others were still pure and splendid, no matter their colour or size, they were each as perfect as the last. She heard the trickle of water underneath Niall and Theo’s conversation. It sounded as if a stream was nearby as they moved further north. She was suddenly very conscious of the stains of sweat and grime on her friend’s and her clothes. She pulled her tunic to her face. It was not the floral scent she was used to as a Princess. She noticed Syren had disappeared from up front, Ayda had pulled back to them.‘Syren has gone to find this water and make sure the way is clear.’ Ayda informed them.The other’s all smiled and nodded, Elle could see the prospect of a nice soak and wash to them was a blessing. The horses could also do with a water stop, they had not been able to spare much of their own supply. Moments later Syren reappeared from a cluster of trees not far from them.‘It’s a small lake, there’s a stream that comes from the mountains. There’s no one there.’ She said, not able to hide the excitement form her voice. Everyone looked at Ayda expectantly.‘Please Ayda.’ Elle begged.‘This is a place many people will travel to for rest.’ Ayda explained her doubts.‘We haven’t washed or bathed in days Ayda, we’ll all feel so much better for it.’ Niall said softly.‘And I’m pretty sure the Princess had blonde hair at one point!’ Theo jested, gently nudging Elle who smiled. Ayda nodded. Several whoops sounded from Niall and Theo. Kicking their horses back into action, the troupe moved quickly towards the small cluster of trees, Elle saw the small trickling stream and revelled in the sound. The water peacefully flowed over the rocks, and clear water glistened in the sunlight. As they reached the small lake, everyone’s moods lightened. Niall helped Elle from her saddle and then raced a limping Theo down to the lake where they both dived headfirst fully clothed.‘Oh, for goodness sake!’ Syren spat, ‘Be quiet, you’ll attract attention!’‘Sorry!’ Niall called over in a shouted whisper. The two of them were splashing around like boys playing in a river. Every now and then one of them would go under the water, reappear and drag the other under. Elle found herself giggling at them as she watched.‘Come over here Elle,’ Ayda summoned. She showed her a shallow section of water hidden behind an assortment of rocks, away from eyes where the young Princess could bathe in peace.‘I’ll wash your clothes,’ Syren offered, taking them as Elle shimmied into the water. Ayda sat against the rock, considering the trees that thinly surrounded the lake. The water was cool against Elle’s sore skin, the cuts and grazes stung slightly but soon numbed in the freshness of the water. Ducking her head into the depths, she began to run her fingers through her messy hair. She decided this was a good opportunity to talk to her sister.‘I’m sorry Ayda.’ Elle said quietly. Ayda sighed.‘It’s OK, it’s a lot to take in, but I understand.’ Elle busied herself washing out the vast amounts of curly, matted, hair. Without a brush she knew she was fighting a losing battle.‘You can’t control it can you?’ Ayda asked.‘No.’ Elle replied. The peacefulness she had felt at sitting in the cool calm lake and hearing the boys laughing and crying in happiness shattered at the thought of her magic.‘Have you tried?’‘No. Every time I have used magic, so many have died.’‘You must be strong, to bring down the castle,’ Ayda figured. Elle nodded. ‘Why did you?’‘Why did I what?’ Elle asked, staring absently into the water.‘Bring down the Castle.’‘I didn’t mean to! I was so angry, Father had just been killed, everything just kind of exploded!’ Elle said loudly, tears filled her eyes, she stood. The tension in her body snapped. She had been desperately trying to clean, trying to relax but she never could. She would never be rid of the horror of her magic. Her magic had been the cause of everything and she hated it. No matter how hard she scrubbed or how long she sat in that water, the magic would never go away. She had to live with it. Ayda wrapped her in the blanket used for sleeping at sat her on the smoothest rocks.‘I’m sorry, don’t be upset, I’m just trying to understand.’ Ayda cooed.‘I hate it Ayda!’ Elle wailed, ‘My magic has destroyed everything! Mother and Father would be alive if the Elder’s didn’t want me!’ Elle felt the anger bubbling beneath her skin, why did no one understand? She was angry with her sister, she couldn’t just give her a few moments of peace without accusing her of choosing to destroy their home!‘I see the way you all look at me! As if I might explode and hurt you! You’re scared of me!’ She continued to shout, her temper getting the better of her. Ayda looked desperately at her sister and tried to calm her down.‘We’re not afraid of you we know you’d never hurt us!’‘You should be afraid! I’m afraid! You should have seen what I did!’ Flashbacks smashed into her brain and assaulted her presence on reality. Her anger spilled over the brim and she was aware of power developing in her chest. Her eyes firing with anger as she glared at her sister, unseeing, drowning in the pit of her anger, her fear. Brielle did not hear her sister beg her to stop and did not hear the other’s crying in pain. She remembered the pain she extracted from her Father’s betrayers. It was what she lived for. She was blind to everything around her, the power had seeped out from within her and was white hot with venom. Her heart was beating fast and her breathing was out of control.‘Elle, stop!’ Ayda screamed. She had never heard Ayda scream like that. The panic and soul shredding fear slapped her in the face. For the first time she could see. Ayda’s face was red hot and her eyes were streaming with tears.‘Elle, stop! Please!” Ayda cried out again. Elle felt her feet on the dirt. She looked around at the lake behind her, the sight she beheld was enough to pull her to her knees. The lake was bubbling and hissing, pillows of steam rose rapidly from the depths, looking closer she saw hundreds of charred fish floating lifelessly on the surface being pushed around by erupting bubbles. She had boiled the lake! She cried and begged for it to stop, but her magic kept coming, flowing through her veins. The lake was hissing furiously, angry bubbles frothing on the surface, steam spiralling high into the sky. Finally, exhausted, she fell shaking to the floor, in floods of warm tears.",

      "content": "9 – AYDAShaking, Ayda dragged her sister’s limp, frail form from the side of the lake and clutched at her.‘Elle, I’m so sorry, forgive me.’ Ayda whispered to her. Elle’s eyes were closed but tears were falling. Heavy droplets of regret splashing the dirt.‘Is – is everyone ok?’ She asked timidly, not daring to open her eyes. Ayda had watched on in fear as she saw the water near Elle slowly bubble, she had called out frantically to the others who thankfully left the lake quicker than she expected.‘We’re OK.’ Niall called out. Ayda could hear the quake in his voice, he couldn’t believe he had nearly been boiled alive. Ayda took a few moments with her sister to compose herself and steady her breathing. It scared her how powerful her little sister was. It scared her that she now knew Elle could not control it. The scariest thing, however, was not knowing how to help. She knew that the Wastes was not going to solve their problems, they needed to find someone urgently to teach Elle. Magic had been gone for centuries – who would know what to do? It hit her quickly, but it was a long shot.‘Elle, the girl that spoke to you in the Ritual – what did she sound like? Did you recognise her?’ Ayda asked urgently. Her heart dropped when Elle looked up and shook her head.‘Do you think she could help us if we could find her?’ Syren asked, bringing fresh clothes over to Elle.‘She’s the only one that we think knows magic other than the Elders.’ Ayda asked.‘But we don’t even know where to start finding her. What about the Temple of Scholars?’‘It’s too dangerous.’ Ayda said firmly.‘They have thousand-year-old records, they must know something of magic.’ Syren coerced.‘But they are in the pocket of the Elders. They are their scholars.’Syren nodded, agreeing, ‘So how do we find this girl? We don’t know her name or what she looks like.’ Ayda had not figured that out yet, it was a big world and they didn’t have any leads. She looked at her companions and felt a bitter spread of guilt. Niall, Theo and Karl were stood, unsure, at a loss themselves. They didn’t need to be here, Ayda thought, they had helped her from the beginning. She would not have got far without them. Theo was sporting a damaged leg that he not once complained of. They were risking their lives for her and Elle and she didn’t know what to do. It was likely they would be killed, and it seemed this was more and more likely to be an accident. She looked at her small sister who finally had the courage to stand and begin to dress amidst her sobs and shakes. How would her sister feel if she accidentally killed someone?‘You should leave us.’ Ayda said unfeelingly to her companions. They all looked at her in shock, except for Niall.‘I knew you were going to say that.’ Niall said sadly, shaking his head.‘She’s right Niall, we are no help in the trials to come.’ Karl said, he looked thrilled at the prospect of going home.‘Why?’ Theo asked weakly, he had decided to lean against a nearby rock, his face was hurt as he looked between the two Princesses.‘You have done us a great service, but I don’t know how much more help you can be without getting in the way.’ Ayda replied, not looking them in the eye.‘What are you going to do?’ Niall asked.‘We’ll figure something out.’‘That’s your plan?’ Niall said in disbelief, ‘We’ve come all this way, and you’re just going to kill yourself out of pity?’‘It’s not pity.’ Ayda replied stubbornly.‘What is it then? You want us to go because we can’t help you, but without us you wouldn’t even be here!’ Niall’s voice was rising. Ayda did not want to express her fear about Elle’s magic, she knew how upset her sister would be, Brielle would take it to heart.‘Yes, we are fighting against the odds! Yes, we are most likely going to die one way or another.’ Niall continued firmly, staring her hard in the face. ‘I want to fight for something that is worth my life, and your sister, Princess Elle is capable of great things, with or without her magic, and I WILL be there for her when she needs me!’‘You can’t! If she can’t protect herself what are we going to do!? She’s stronger than us!’ Ayda snapped.‘There are other types of magic! There is friendship. There is love. That’s what she needs from us. She is still a child.’ Niall finished with a deep breath.‘How is that supposed to help her?’ Ayda said timidly, he was right, she thought, but she wasn’t ready to admit it.‘When her world fills with darkness and her magic can’t save her. We’ll be the light that she needs.’ With that, Niall moved forwards to the trembling Princess. She greeted him a hug as he crouched down to her height. Ayda was defeated, she knew he was right. She had wanted to protect them from risk and save her sister from herself, but her sister needed her friends, and they were so short on them right now.‘I am staying with the Princesses. Karl, Theo, I will not hold it against you if you choose to leave.’‘I don’t know why you ask, we’re always with you brother.’ Theo nodded. Karl grunted his agreement, but disapproval was written on his face. His heart was torn between his home, and the small girl-elf in front of him. They moved on as quickly as possible, Ayda was sure the bellowing steam rising high into the sky was sure to attract the wrong attention. She did not want to be caught out. They had decided it was clear enough to move through the night, they were keen to put distance between themselves and the lake. In her exhaustion Elle had fallen asleep in front of Ayda as they rode through the night, the moon lighting their path. The countryside was quiet, an occasional rustle signalled the presence of a rabbit or fox fleeing their steps. The sounds of hunters going about their business resounded through the air after each kill. Niall and Karl were leading the way, in deep discussion. Ayda heard snippets that confirmed her theory, Karl was unhappy.‘He doesn’t like us, does he?’ Ayda asked Theo. Theo had always been kind to her and Elle, even though he did all he could to avoid Syren. She couldn’t blame him, Syren was filled with hatred for humans. She had lost her entire family in one attack by them many years ago and had devoted her life to protecting her people from their malice. Syren was distantly behind them, watching the landscape for followers.‘He isn’t keen on this. He doesn’t understand what’s to gain. But, considering Syren’s loathing of him and your indifference, can you blame him?’ Theo soothed. Ayda guessed not. Ayda knew she had a long way to go before she accepted humans. She could not forgive them for her friend’s death and the death of so many people. She could talk to Theo, she found herself growing slowly to like him and appreciate him. Niall and Karl, however, she wasn’t sure she could. Niall was so infuriating, he pranced around like he was King, as if no one would dare threaten him. He was so confident and so boy-like she found him irksome. Karl, only spoke to offer dissuasion, she guessed he was the practical one of the three, the father figure somewhat, since he rarely joined in on their games and was always so alert and calculating.‘Why does Niall insist on joining us?’ Ayda asked.‘He has grown to care for your sister, she is truly special, even Karl has developed a soft spot I believe. But more than that, we have learned of magic, and this fight could spread to our race.” Theo offered kindly, riding beside her.‘He’s a thief. He only came for the horses, he cares not for history lessons.’ Ayda said scornfully. She wasn’t truly sure that was how she felt, but she was happy for Theo to believe it.‘He certainly doesn’t show his feelings well, but they are there. Surely you see his love for your sister and his interest in her path?’ Theo asked, Ayda ignored the question. Of course, she saw his love for Elle, he was here for her. To protect her and guide her. He had hugged her and played games with her just to make her smile. He had done nothing of the sort for Ayda. Just left her, as she liked it.‘Why do you and Karl follow him so loyally?’‘We are brothers. Niall would do anything for his friends and we have been through a lot together. I would gladly give my life for him.’ Theo said with such confidence. Ayda grunted, was he that great a person but she just could not see it?‘Look, you two have hardly spoken, maybe you should start by asking him how he knew where that tunnel was?’ Ayda glanced at him, what did he mean by that? She had been wondering how he knew, but recent events had distracted her. The way Theo was looking at her was unnerving, it was like he knew a secret about her, that she didn’t know. It bothered her.‘I am a bit shocked that you two are so, well, odd, towards each other,’ Theo continued, ‘after all you have been through.’ Ayda had guessed that they knew about her, they knew the story. How Niall had stolen her away but left him behind and then refused to help her get her friend back. Thankfully, Theo left it at that, seeing the look on Ayda’s face and moved away to join his friends at the front. Syren took the opportunity to catch up.‘What did he want?’ She demanded spitefully, gesturing at Theo.‘Just talking.’ Ayda mumbled.‘You never told me how you know him.’ Syren said. By him Ayda thought she must mean Niall, there was a special place in Syren’s heart for him, full of loathing and contempt.‘I don’t really know him. Just bumped into him when we were children.’ Ayda waved a hand. She did not want to add fuel to the fire by telling Syren that story. She was doing all she could to forget it. Syren’s face screwed up, she didn’t believe Ayda at all, but Ayda was grateful when she chose not to pursue the topic.‘What are we going to do about Princess Brielle?’ Syren asked, ‘If she can’t control her magic, we already have too many enemies.’‘I don’t know. I want to find someone to teach her,’ Ayda said, checking that Elle was still soundly sleeping. Elle had hardly spoken since her outburst, her magic had drained and weakened her, leaving her exhausted. Ayda didn’t know how long she’d been asleep.‘We have to flee from our pursuers and somehow get Elle some help. This is becoming impossible.’ Syren sighed.‘It’s why we need all the help we can get.’ Ayda said pointedly. Syren groaned.‘We don’t need them here Ayda!’‘As much as I hate to admit it, Niall’s right. She needs all her friends and family.’‘And you think they’re her friends? Humans are not friends to Elves!’‘This resentment you hold must stop! For her sake!’ Ayda commanded firmly.‘I lost my whole family Ayda! At least you still have your sister!’ Syren spat angrily.‘They did not kill your family,’ Ayda said calmly, ‘I’m truly sorry for your loss, I am, but we need to be stronger! These are the only friends we have!’Silence followed. Everyone had stopped to watch them. Ayda had not realised how loud their voices had become. They had probably been heard. Niall had a thoughtful look on his face, he could not seem to take his eyes off her. She felt herself growing nervous, had she said something wrong? He moved forward towards her and Syren.‘Ayda is right, this must stop. If you feel you cannot work as part of the team, then maybe you should go.’ He said to Syren his voice thick with ice.‘How dare you?!’ Syren hissed, Ayda had never seen her so angry.‘The same goes for all of us. We must be strong. We have our differences, but it is what share that we fight for.’ Ayda spoke clearly and confidently. Finally, she and Niall agreed on something. She hated how much stronger she felt when she knew he had her back.‘Spoken like a true Queen.’ Theo smiled at her.‘Ayda, you know I’m with you. But, I can’t be with them!’ Syren pleaded. Ayda could see this was the end of the road for her friend.‘You don’t have to like them. Just put the past where it belongs. In the past.’ Ayda whispered to her dear friend. It broke her heart to demand she make this choice, but the bickering and the mistrust could not go on. The team was facing such trials and such odds, there was no room for weakness that could lead to betrayal. Syren’s face was full of anger, Ayda knew she was longing to attack them. The anger was seeping from her friend like water through a gauze. They walked on, leaving Syren to make her choice. Miles down the road, Syren had not reappeared. She had made her choice. Ayda struggled to hold back her tears. Syren was her last friend, and she had pushed her away. Syren had chosen her hatred of humans over loyalty. Now, Ayda found herself alone, putting her trust in those she had been brought up to hate. Humans.",

      "content": "9 – AYDAShaking, Ayda dragged her sister’s limp, frail form from the side of the lake and clutched at her.‘Elle, I’m so sorry, forgive me.’ Ayda whispered to her. Elle’s eyes were closed but tears were falling. Heavy droplets of regret splashing the dirt.‘Is – is everyone ok?’ She asked timidly, not daring to open her eyes. Ayda had watched on in fear as she saw the water near Elle slowly bubble, she had called out frantically to the others who thankfully left the lake quicker than she expected.‘We’re OK.’ Niall called out. Ayda could hear the quake in his voice, he couldn’t believe he had nearly been boiled alive. Ayda took a few moments with her sister to compose herself and steady her breathing. It scared her how powerful her little sister was. It scared her that she now knew Elle could not control it. The scariest thing, however, was not knowing how to help. She knew that the Wastes was not going to solve their problems, they needed to find someone urgently to teach Elle. Magic had been gone for centuries – who would know what to do? It hit her quickly, but it was a long shot.‘Elle, the girl that spoke to you in the Ritual – what did she sound like? Did you recognise her?’ Ayda asked urgently. Her heart dropped when Elle looked up and shook her head.‘Do you think she could help us if we could find her?’ Syren asked, bringing fresh clothes over to Elle.‘She’s the only one that we think knows magic other than the Elders.’ Ayda asked.‘But we don’t even know where to start finding her. What about the Temple of Scholars?’‘It’s too dangerous.’ Ayda said firmly.‘They have thousand-year-old records, they must know something of magic.’ Syren coerced.‘But they are in the pocket of the Elders. They are their scholars.’Syren nodded, agreeing, ‘So how do we find this girl? We don’t know her name or what she looks like.’ Ayda had not figured that out yet, it was a big world and they didn’t have any leads. She looked at her companions and felt a bitter spread of guilt. Niall, Theo and Karl were stood, unsure, at a loss themselves. They didn’t need to be here, Ayda thought, they had helped her from the beginning. She would not have got far without them. Theo was sporting a damaged leg that he not once complained of. They were risking their lives for her and Elle and she didn’t know what to do. It was likely they would be killed, and it seemed this was more and more likely to be an accident. She looked at her small sister who finally had the courage to stand and begin to dress amidst her sobs and shakes. How would her sister feel if she accidentally killed someone?‘You should leave us.’ Ayda said unfeelingly to her companions. They all looked at her in shock, except for Niall.‘I knew you were going to say that.’ Niall said sadly, shaking his head.‘She’s right Niall, we are no help in the trials to come.’ Karl said, he looked thrilled at the prospect of going home.‘Why?’ Theo asked weakly, he had decided to lean against a nearby rock, his face was hurt as he looked between the two Princesses.‘You have done us a great service, but I don’t know how much more help you can be without getting in the way.’ Ayda replied, not looking them in the eye.‘What are you going to do?’ Niall asked.‘We’ll figure something out.’‘That’s your plan?’ Niall said in disbelief, ‘We’ve come all this way, and you’re just going to kill yourself out of pity?’‘It’s not pity.’ Ayda replied stubbornly.‘What is it then? You want us to go because we can’t help you, but without us you wouldn’t even be here!’ Niall’s voice was rising. Ayda did not want to express her fear about Elle’s magic, she knew how upset her sister would be, Brielle would take it to heart.‘Yes, we are fighting against the odds! Yes, we are most likely going to die one way or another.’ Niall continued firmly, staring her hard in the face. ‘I want to fight for something that is worth my life, and your sister, Princess Elle is capable of great things, with or without her magic, and I WILL be there for her when she needs me!’‘You can’t! If she can’t protect herself what are we going to do!? She’s stronger than us!’ Ayda snapped.‘There are other types of magic! There is friendship. There is love. That’s what she needs from us. She is still a child.’ Niall finished with a deep breath.‘How is that supposed to help her?’ Ayda said timidly, he was right, she thought, but she wasn’t ready to admit it.‘When her world fills with darkness and her magic can’t save her. We’ll be the light that she needs.’ With that, Niall moved forwards to the trembling Princess. She greeted him a hug as he crouched down to her height. Ayda was defeated, she knew he was right. She had wanted to protect them from risk and save her sister from herself, but her sister needed her friends, and they were so short on them right now.‘I am staying with the Princesses. Karl, Theo, I will not hold it against you if you choose to leave.’‘I don’t know why you ask, we’re always with you brother.’ Theo nodded. Karl grunted his agreement, but disapproval was written on his face. His heart was torn between his home, and the small girl-elf in front of him. They moved on as quickly as possible, Ayda was sure the bellowing steam rising high into the sky was sure to attract the wrong attention. She did not want to be caught out. They had decided it was clear enough to move through the night, they were keen to put distance between themselves and the lake. In her exhaustion Elle had fallen asleep in front of Ayda as they rode through the night, the moon lighting their path. The countryside was quiet, an occasional rustle signalled the presence of a rabbit or fox fleeing their steps. The sounds of hunters going about their business resounded through the air after each kill. Niall and Karl were leading the way, in deep discussion. Ayda heard snippets that confirmed her theory, Karl was unhappy.‘He doesn’t like us, does he?’ Ayda asked Theo. Theo had always been kind to her and Elle, even though he did all he could to avoid Syren. She couldn’t blame him, Syren was filled with hatred for humans. She had lost her entire family in one attack by them many years ago and had devoted her life to protecting her people from their malice. Syren was distantly behind them, watching the landscape for followers.‘He isn’t keen on this. He doesn’t understand what’s to gain. But, considering Syren’s loathing of him and your indifference, can you blame him?’ Theo soothed. Ayda guessed not. Ayda knew she had a long way to go before she accepted humans. She could not forgive them for her friend’s death and the death of so many people. She could talk to Theo, she found herself growing slowly to like him and appreciate him. Niall and Karl, however, she wasn’t sure she could. Niall was so infuriating, he pranced around like he was King, as if no one would dare threaten him. He was so confident and so boy-like she found him irksome. Karl, only spoke to offer dissuasion, she guessed he was the practical one of the three, the father figure somewhat, since he rarely joined in on their games and was always so alert and calculating.‘Why does Niall insist on joining us?’ Ayda asked.‘He has grown to care for your sister, she is truly special, even Karl has developed a soft spot I believe.

      "content": "10 – NIALLShe was heartbroken. Her eyes were glassy and her lips trembling. Her face was paler than ever. He thought she was beautiful still. He shook the thought from his head. What was the point in harbouring such thoughts and feelings? She despised him, it felt like he was walking on egg shells around her, always having to be careful what to say or do. It annoyed him. She was so much like the girl he remembered, ferocious, loyal and caring. But she was so serious. He guessed that anybody would be serious if they had been through what they had. She had lost everything, after all. Niall never shared with anyone his concerns. They continued to plod further north, everyone knowing there was nothing for them north, but equally no one knowing what else to do. The aim was to keep moving and get the Legion off their trail, until someone had a better plan. He sighed, he was pretty sure this light bulb moment was further in the distance than they had time for. It had been days since they had left Syren behind. Ayda had hardly spoken to anyone except for Elle, who seemed equally distraught at Syren’s abandonment. It must be terrible for them, he thought, knowing that their own Protectors, their own people had all turned on them, and now finally, their very last elven friend had left them too. He felt partly responsible, if they had left, Syren would still be with her. But he could not leave them. Ayda had always been with him from the moment he took her in, his mind had always been with her, and now she was here, he felt he had purpose again. Then there was Elle, like a little sister to him, she was so special, so sweet and pure, he could not leave her. He felt as though the world could change with these two. Together they were so strong, so fearless, he felt a surge of pride as he thought that after all they had been through and were yet to go through they were standing together, as surely as ever. Alone in their mourning, alone in their fear. It reminded him very much of the companionship he had with his brothers. The five of them were so lucky that in the face of it all they had such strength in their relationship they were the toughest of allies. It was just a shame that Syren could not see it.The further north they progressed the colder it became. The luscious green pastures they had been travelling through had become hard and crisp, green grass had been replaced with white frost. There was no snow yet, but he felt sure that soon a thick, fluffy, sparkling blanket would settle around them. He could not deny it’s beauty, each morning, he would awaken, stiff and uncomfortable to see frozen droplets glittering from trees and a light mist floating in the distance. There was something magical about it. Theo’s leg had vastly improved and had managed to steal several warm winter cloaks that were left hanging outside people’s homes. They had passed several empty villages, all void of life, and managed to scrape together some essentials. Wrapped up as warm as they could with some supplies, they had continued. Ayda had been concerned about the villages, according to her, the only abandoned villages they would find would be at the Wastes. She was upset to find so many lifeless dwellings. It had made the group nervous. Had the people fled the winter, or were they forcibly removed? Was something circling them like a hawk circles its prey? They had no way of knowing.‘Fire!’ Elle squeaked from the middle of the group. This time she was riding with Theo on his white stallion. Niall had suggested she sit with each of them in turn, to save any one horse from excess weight every day. Elle had agreed but had expressed her desire for her own horse to care for. So, Niall had promised that the first horse they could get for her, she would have. Niall looked where the young Princess was pointing, there was indeed smoke rising in the distance.‘Could it be a village?’ Niall asked Ayda, who seemed to know this area quite well. She nodded, concern in her eyes.‘It could be a trap.’ Karl said sternly.‘I agree, we should avoid it.’ Niall nodded.‘If it’s my people, I will help them,’ Ayda announced firmly.‘And me!’ Piped up Elle.‘Well, you’ll never know, because we’re going arou- where do you think you’re going!?’ Niall called, Ayda had galloped off in the direction of the fire.‘God damn it! She wants us to protect her, but the only thing she needs protecting from is her stupidity,’ He cursed, they chased after her. It was a town, another white stone town. Elves were screaming and running in a frenzy from burning homes, the stone that held their town together was cracking and smashing as it was assaulted by blast upon blast by thrown explosives. Thankfully Ayda stopped as the group re-joined her just out of sight.‘What’s going on?’ Niall hissed.‘It’s the Legion, they’re attacking the town.’ Ayda whispered, her voice crushed as she watched her people brutally battered by the soldiers. Each soldier was clad head to toe in red, with black armour covering every inch of his body.‘We need to leave!’ Karl growled, taking in the scene before him.‘There aren’t many of them – we can take them!’ Ayda said defiantly.‘You just said it’s the Legion, you know, the ones that want to kill you!’ Niall said, outraged. Here he was risking his neck to keep her and her sister alive and now she just wanted to hand herself over to the people who want her dead.‘They’re our people Niall!’‘We’re NOT going in there!’‘If it was your people what would you do?’ Ayda demanded.‘I thought you said the Legion had magic?’‘Only the Captain, these are just soldiers!’‘Oh, should be a piece of piss then, just a normal fight with trained swords and no magic!’ Niall replied sarcastically.‘I’m going to save my people, do what you want!’ Ayda spat, bored of the argument. Pelting away from the group she ran full throttle into the town. Swearing loudly and shouting quick instructions to Theo to keep Elle away, he and Karl bolted after her. Niall watched, impressed, just as Ayda flew from her horse, and smashed a shocked soldier into the flames, rock fell, and he was crushed instantly. A second soldier died moments later, as Ayda pounced upon him and thrust her blade through the eye of his mask. Riding into the chaos, Niall smashed the hilt of his sword into the face of a passing soldier as Karl ran one through. As soon as they were close enough, they jumped from their horses and ran to Ayda’s side just as she had finished another soldier with a vicious slice to his throat. She kept crying out to the towns people, begging them to run. But with the sight of her something in the balance had changed. Several men picked up blades from the fallen and rushed to fight by her side. Soon, a small battalion had formed around her of Elves standing their ground slashing their way together through the soldiers. Many towns people fell, bleeding, they were not much use against the armour and training of the Legion’s Soldiers. Ayda felt her heart swell with pride, fighting beside her people. They had not all abandoned her. Ayda heard Niall laugh with relief as he finished the final soldier. The Elves before her cheered and celebrated their victory, then many turned to the wounded and dying, and the utter pain of defeat hit them. Niall stepped closer to Ayda has she was approached.‘Princess, it’s good to see you – but you should not have come.’ An older Elf with wispy hair, knelt to her and took her hand.‘It is good to see you too Sir -?’‘I am Aran, your Highness.’ He kissed her hand.‘Are you the leader here?’ She asked.‘No, your Highness, our Lord fled long ago, he heard of the raids on villages, knew they were heading here.’ Aran said.‘He just left you all here?’ Ayda responded, aghast.‘Of course, he fears the Legion. I must say, we would all be dead now if it wasn’t for you and your – ah – comrades. Humans?!’ Aran’s pleasure turned to panic as he saw Niall and Karl.‘Aran,’ Ayda stepped before them, ‘These are friends, they have done much to protect me.’Aran eyed them both suspiciously. Niall felt the Elves around them watching him closely. He puffed up with pleasure as he saw Ayda step into defend them and refer to them as friends. Maybe she was starting to trust him after all? Aran could not seem to take his eyes of him. He was a short, stocky Elf, who’s dirty farmer’s clothes did not suit the heavy metal sword in his hand.‘Aran, is there any news? Why are they raiding villages here?’ Ayda asked quickly. Niall knew she was keen to move on, news would spread, and retribution would be swift, she did not want to get caught here.‘They know you are in the area my Princess, they are ruthless in their hunt for you and Princess Brielle,’ Aran asked, his eyes snapping back to her.‘Yet you remain loyal to my family? Why?’ Ayda asked politely.‘The King ruled in peace and brought prosperity to Myrliar, The Legion undo all of his honourable work. We will remember him. He would not have stood for all this bloodshed. The Elders deserve no loyalty after what they have done.’Ayda replied, ‘I thank you, but you must all leave, they will return.’‘You are most kind, your Highness, but I fear we will all die, wherever we go.’ Niall followed Ayda, as they searched the town for their horses. Bodies littered the ground, soldier and town people alike, the white paved streets were bleeding. Niall felt his heart ache as he watched the distress shadowing Ayda’s face as she heard her people crying in pain. She was kind, he saw. Every so often she would help put out fires and hold the hands of dying elves, offering what condolences she could. Finally, they found each of their horses on route. Leading them back to the main group of Elves to bid their farewell and wish them luck.‘Farewell, Princess, best of luck. We are all with you.’ Aran said enthusiastically, kneeling once more. Just as the three of them turned to leave, a cold cruel voice sounded from the other side of the town square. Looking up Niall’s blood turned to ice as he saw what he had feared the most. A blood red cloak was sweeping across the stone paves, soaking blood up as it went. A silver half mask covered the face of the wearer, his crooked black teeth smiling evilly at them.‘Princess Ayda, it’s wonderful to see you here.’ His voice was sickeningly smooth, like wine laced with poison. This man emanated power. He stood alone, but confident, the world around him seemed to bend to his will as he moved ever closer to them.‘Run, Princess, run! We’ll distract him.’ Aran whispered to them. Niall admired the man’s courage. Surely, he knew he would stand no chance against a Captain of the Legion. Niall didn’t know what to do, he had only heard about the Captains from Elle, but he knew he had magic. He could almost sense it glowing from him. He knew their swords were going to be no more than feathers to this man.‘You know, there is nowhere for you to run your Highness. Where is your sister?’ The man gloated.‘I’d die before I told you!’ Ayda spat. Niall resisted the urge to grab her, she sounded so strong, but he could see her trembling as their death approached.‘Oh, you will die, but I have soldiers searching around this town right now, so you can watch me kill her first.’ The Captain could hardly contain his glee. His black crooked teeth had been showing since his arrival, he could not stop grinning like a cat that has cornered a mouse.‘She’s nowhere near here you fool!’ Ayda laughed convincingly.‘You mean to tell me you abandoned her? Never. You’ll be keeping her close by.’ He seethed.Niall thought quickly, they would find her for sure. She wasn’t too far away, and Theo was not going to be able to protect her against so many foes alone. They had to buy them some time. Thankfully, Ayda seemed to have come to the same conclusion. Moving away from Niall and Karl she was pacing closer to the Captain, his gaze following her unblinkingly. From the corner of his eye, Niall could see a small boy crouched, hiding a few yards from him. Slowly, he moved over, careful not to draw attention. The Captain’s eyes were stuck on Ayda like a wolf hunting its prey. He reached the boy, and out of the corner of his mouth he spoke.‘I need you to do something urgently for me.’ Niall whispered. The boy’s big eyes were wide with fear.‘I need you to take a message to Princess Brielle for me.’ He continued. He hoped the boy was loyal to the Princesses, this was a huge risk, but he had to get them away from here. The boy, although afraid, nodded.‘Tell her a Captain is here, he is searching for her, she must flee. My friend Theo will be with her. Go with them, they will keep you safe.’ He whispered instructions on how to find the Princess, and the boy snuck quickly and quietly from the town, in the wrong direction. Niall had instructed him not to go straight there, to make sure he wasn’t easily followed. Niall hadn’t noticed that a few of the town folk had moved, led by Aran, slowly and carefully through the burnt-out buildings closer and closer to the Captain. Niall watched them with fascination. They had planned this and moved without so much as a flicker of acknowledgement from the Captain. Was he that focussed on Ayda? Suddenly, the men ran from their hiding spots as one, their swords raised, screaming “For the King!” He had noticed them. He didn’t hesitate as he swung his arms in the air, the men rose helplessly like puppets before he flung them against a nearby building. With a nasty crunch, the men slid down the wall and landed in a pile on the ground, unmoving, not even a breath. Niall spied Aran’s face at the bottom of the pile, his face was as fixed with determination in death as it had been in life. Shock shook Niall, what chance did any of them have against a monster that powerful?‘Niall, move, quickly!’ Karl snapped, jabbing him in the ribs. Niall noticed with a pang that Ayda was gone. He let Karl lead him away as he scanned the area for her, he couldn’t see her anywhere.‘Does the Captain have her?’ He asked urgently. Karl shook his head, everyone had used the scuffle to flee the town hall and hide. A loud crack resonated through the air, peering around a corner, he glimpsed the Captain blasting everything out of the way in his fury to find her.‘We have to find her!’ Niall whispered, ducking as another crash sounded. They ran, amidst the chaos as buildings around them exploded, trapping fleeing civilians, the shrieking and smashing was thunderous. A woman yards from them flew off her feet as she caught the sight of the Captain, who laughed wickedly as she fell into flame. The Captain was calling for her. Niall tried to keep him in eye sight as much as he could whilst searching for the Princess.‘Oh no,’ He said, aghast. The Captain had grown bored of smashing things and had instead woven magic into the form of five great silver wolves. The same wolves that had hunted them nights before.‘Climb, climb!’ Niall roared to everyone around him. He and Karl climbed rubble onto the nearest roof, helping as many as they could. The wolves were ravaging anyone they could find. Karl leapt onto another roof top, Niall followed. Scouting around looking for Ayda, finally they saw her. Thankfully she had also managed to escape the jaws of the giant wolves rampaging their way through the town. Blood curdling screams filled the air as the wolves continued to find their victims. Niall dared not call out to her. He couldn’t bear to see these enemies press down on her. He nudged Karl and nodded in her direction. Slowly and carefully, staying on the roof tops, they climbed over to her. Then it happened, in a split second, Ayda was thrown into the air like a doll. The Captain had found her. Niall watched in terror as her body zoomed through the air and was caught roughly by the throat. She kicked and squirmed as his nails dug into her neck.‘No!’ Niall roared. The wolves around them disappeared into white smoke, they were no longer needed, the Captain had what he wanted. Niall threw himself off the rooftop and sprinted to her faster than he had ever ran in his life. He could not defeat this man, he knew that, but he had to do something. Niall shouted for her as he reached them. Turning his head, the Captain grinned wickedly at Niall and snapped his fingers together. Immediately Niall’s body froze, his legs and arms were pinned, he fell forwards with the momentum of his run and landed face first on the cold hard slabs. The Captain turned and walked away from him, his hand still around Ayda’s throat, carrying her as if she were lighter than air. Niall felt himself being turned over and dragged unceremoniously away. Karl roughly sat him against a wall.‘There’s nothing we can do brother!’ Karl growled as he slapped him. Niall still could not move but he could see. He watched helplessly, his eyes stinging as Ayda was carried away. He had almost given up hope when… BANG. The Captain stumbled back. BANG. Pushed back again, the Captain lost his hold on Ayda, she stumbled, and crawled desperately away from him. An invisible force was battering the Captain. His shield reverberated through the air, ripples showing in the invisible barrier around him. Shock was etched onto the Captain’s face as he spun around trying to find the source of this power. A grin grew across his face. Niall’s heart sank. Elle had come for her sister. She was walking like a girl much older than her years. A confidence born of anger and hatred, her face was twisted with a dark fury. Niall nursed a deep fear of her, her eyes were black as coal and unseeing. She did not appear to notice the destruction around her as her eyes fixed on the Captain in a deadly glare. Ayda was weeping, in pain or shock no-one knew, Niall wanted to call out to her, but he still couldn’t move. Karl was stuck to his side threateningly, ready to defend his friend against anything. He watched as Elle continued to move forward pelting the Captain with strike after strike, he was no longer stumbling, he expected her. His shield held firm as her attack continued, then finally she paused, measuring her target. He made the most of her hesitation and pushed his magic into the buildings next to her, they exploded all around her. Niall heard screaming ringing in his mind. Dust choked everyone, he couldn’t see her. Ayda had not moved from her spot, she looked ready to jump in to save her sister, but what could she do? The dust settled, and Elle emerged, she had conjured a shield and saved herself from the blast, to the amusement of the Captain and the surprised relief of everyone else.‘You are learning little one.’ He cajoled. Instantly sparks shot from his outstretched hands and electrified her shield, millions of ripples resounded through the air. Elle’s small face was scrunched up as she concentrated on her shield. Niall watched as white-hot flames burst out of her hand and surrounded the Captain in a blaze. Both mages continued to batter each-other fiercely, with none making a huge impact, blow after blow was blocked, their shields stood strong.‘Someone’s got to tire first. Let’s hope it’s not Elle.’ Karl grumbled. It couldn’t be Elle, Niall reassured himself. The Captain spent so much of his power on those fearsome wolves and blowing up this town, surely after Elle managed to bring down a Castle and kill every soldier there she must be stronger! His resolve began to falter as the battle ensued. Elle stopped attacking, her little angry face was screwed up and tight as she concentrated fully on her shield. A huge blast of power from the Captain quaked her shield and she stumbled backwards a few steps. She was losing. Her magic was failing. Ayda had spotted it too, as quickly as she could, she ran towards the Captain with her sword raised, roaring in desperation. The Captain didn’t even look at her as he waved his hand and sent her flying. She fell, motionless like a doll, to the floor beside them. Niall was furious, he still could not move, he couldn’t even call out to her and Karl was point blank refusing to leave him. Someone had to help her! Elle grew weaker and weaker by the second, slowly, his heart sank as her shield flickered and she slowly backed down to her knees, tears streaming from her eyes. It all happened at once. The Captain screamed out in pain as a dagger slid its way through his throat just before everything was thrown backwards in a sudden blast of power. Ringing sounded in his ears, dust filled the air. Then silence. Complete eerie silence. Was Elle alive? What had happened to the Captain? Instantly, the feeling in his arms and legs returned, he could move again. Clumsily he got to his feet, aided by Karl, who was covered in soot and dust. He ran over to Ayda and checked her, she was breathing but unconscious. Karl, being larger and stronger picked her up.‘Elle!’ Niall roared. He couldn’t see two feet in front of him. Hands outstretched he began to wade through the dust in the direction he last saw her. Finally, the dust began to settle. Everything was covered in a thin layer of white sand, bodies and bricks alike. The moment Niall saw her he ran to her, occasionally tripping over his new legs.‘Elle you’re OK. Thank the lord you’re OK!’ He sighed deeply with relief, hardly believing it. He made to hug her. She resisted him, gazing into the distance. “Ayda’s OK, we’ve got her, we need to go.”‘She saved me.’ Elle whispered in shock. Confused, Niall followed her gaze to a young woman unmoving on the ground not far from the dead Captain. The woman’s red hair was speckled with dust and debris. Syren.‘Oh no, no, no!’ Niall exclaimed rushing over to Syren’s limp form. Her eyes were open, her breathing was slow. Pain was written all over her pale and dusty face.‘Why did you do that?’ Elle whispered, she had followed Niall to Syren’s side. Syren reached out feebly for the young Princess’s hand.‘You and Ayda are my only family.’ Syren said weakly, breath catching in her throat. With that, Elle kissed her friend on the cheek and whispered something Niall could not hear. He examined the Elf’s body, there were a few scratches and slight bruises visible, but he feared the force of the blast from Elle had caused worse internal damage. There was no way for him to tell what was draining her of life, and he could not see how long she had left. They needed help. They needed a miracle. Wounds he could help to heal, but so little was known of internal injury. He could not help but fear the worst for the young ferocious Elf who had saved their lives. He looked at Ayda, lying in Karl’s arms, and felt his heart hit the floor. How could anyone explain to her that after all she had lost, she was to now lose her dearest friend?‘What do we do?’ Karl asked quietly.‘I don’t know if she can be moved, but we can’t stay here.’ Niall responded, stroking Elle’s hair as she watched over Syren’s frail frame.‘Karl,’ Niall said, standing to look at this friend. ‘Take the Princesses and find Theo, I’m going to stay with Syren.’‘She won’t last, come with us. There’s no point you getting yourself into danger.’ Karl replied firmly.‘I’m not leaving her here alone,’ Niall snapped, ‘She deserves more than that.’ Karl stood resolute. He was not leaving Niall alone. Niall looked at Syren, he had never appreciated her, she had been frustrating and dismissive to him and his friends, but she had been steadfast in their goal. She had risked her life protecting her family, and he could not forget that. Surely, now, they could at last, put race behind them and move on? Syren’s eyes were locked on his. Her eyes once bright, alert and alarming, were now tired and red, betraying the broken body they concealed.‘Leave me,’ She whispered. ‘Keep them safe.’ Niall considered Elle. She was sat, staring at him, her face pale and sickly. Surprisingly, there were no tears. He doubted the poor girl had many tears left to shed after all she had seen and learned. He could not leave Syren, Elle and Ayda would hate him forever. He knew however, that staying here with Syren kept Ayda and Elle at risk, the Legion would come, and they would stand no chance fighting them off now. His heart felt bruised and battered that whichever path he chose, Ayda would forever hate him. He had to make the right decision for everyone.‘I can’t.’ Niall replied, ‘You’re coming with us.’Syren gave a feeble laugh and shook her head, ‘I cannot move, I am too weak.’‘We will carry you.’‘I am dying.’ Syren said matter-of-factly. Niall marvelled at her courage, to throw yourself in harm’s way for those you love and be aware of the price you will pay was admirable. He could not fail to respect her for that.‘Ayda will want to say goodbye, but here, we are all at risk.’ Niall said sadly, kneeling by her side once more. Syren nodded, understanding. He felt uncomfortable at delivering the final message but knew it would do the trick. Syren would do anything for Ayda, that much she had proven.‘Karl, find Theo, we’ll need all the help we can find.’ Niall requested. Karl finally nodded, and carrying Ayda, retreated out of the destroyed village. Elle would not leave Syren’s side, she had not let go of her friend’s hand. Niall decided to leave them alone, he wandered into the nearest wreckage to seek scraps of crates or carts for a make shift litter. He pondered his decision, it would undoubtedly be uncomfortable for Syren, but he could not leave her here alone and he could not risk the Princesses’ safety. Sighing, he collected anything useful he could find, steeling his heart against the broken bodies of villagers lying in the aftermath. Many minutes passed, and he had collected several decent sized planks of wood and lengths of rope.‘Niall!’ He heard Elle shout for him. Then he heard it, distantly he could hear the thunder of hooves pounding the ground. Someone was approaching the village. Niall dashed faster than lightning back to the square. Syren and Elle had somehow managed to shimmy Syren up against a wall, where she was now resting, Elle beside her. Niall stood before them, dropping his collection to the ground nearby, his fist firmly clenching the hilt of his sword, ready to meet the traveller. The horse was a huge, monstrously built black stallion, Niall would guess eighteen hands high, and was armoured in gold matching it’s rider. The rider was head to toe in gold, Niall felt a shiver of remembrance as he took in the stance, and the emblem adorning the golden armour. The Royal Emblem. Niall remembered seeing such armour many years ago when he bid farewell to a young and sad Princess. Niall heard Elle gasp and run to stand beside him.‘It’s Sir Rakel! My Father’s Protector!’ She whispered excitedly. Niall had to stop himself from pointing out that Sir Rakel had not done a particularly good job of protecting the King, seeing as he had been nowhere around at the time of the King’s brutal murder. The horse was approaching ever nearer.‘Stop!’ Niall called out confidently with his sword raised, pushing Elle back with the other hand.‘What are you doing?’ Elle squealed.‘I do not know I can trust him!’ Niall murmured to her, pushing her gently backwards, not lowering his sword arm.‘Peace, boy!’ The rider called out to him, slowing and stopping at a respectful distance.‘What business do you have here?’ Niall responded clearly.‘I have been tracking your party for days, I am here for their Royal Highnesses,’ Sir Rakel called.‘They are no longer here, they have left this village as you see it.’ Niall bluffed feebly.‘Do not try to insult me, for I see young Princess Brielle behind you.’ Sir Rakel laughed, as he dismounted his stallion proudly. He walked confidently closer to them, his gauntleted hands raised in front of him in surrender.‘I would recognise that young Elf anywhere.’ He said proudly, removing his helm and smiling kindly at her as he approached.‘Sir Rakel would never hurt me.’ Elle pleaded with Niall. She was the happiest he had ever seen her, he face was glowing with excitement as she watched Sir Rakel approach. Niall was at a loss, this man he knew to be the same Elf that had rescued Ayda, and he was here, a typical Knight in Shining Armour to protect Elle. But something was amiss, how had this Elf tracked them for so long to now conveniently find them when they were so much weakened. He kept his sword high.‘You are right not to trust me human,’ Sir Rakel said, ‘I know what happened at the Stone Castle, the betrayal my dear King suffered. I am not your enemy.’‘I would not trust anyone with the Princess.’ Niall spat, the niceties had vanished. Sir Rakel growled as he drew his own sword and raised it in challenge. Niall could see the Elf was much older than he, his hair was white, and skin was slightly creased. Niall had always admired the way Elves were spared the fate of time and aged much slower than humans. Despite the difference in age, Niall disliked the odds, this Elf was wiser and heavily armoured. He would not likely win this alone.‘I have known the Princess since she was a babe, and her Father was always my brother, I would ask how I can trust a human with one so precious to me!’‘Stop it!’ Elle screeched, ignoring Niall’s protests she moved between them her hands outstretched. Immediately, Sir Rakel bowed down to one knee, in a gesture of obedience Niall had never seen before. Sensing the danger had passed with Brielle’s intervention, Niall lowered his sword slightly as Elle approached him.‘I know you are trying to protect me. You must learn to trust me, as I do you. You cannot harm this Elf without harming me.’ Brielle said kindly and confidently, her eyes were blazing with emotion. This old soldier meant a lot to her, he could see. He sheathed his sword, glaring at the Golden Protector. Sir Rakel was still bowed on one knee, his sword on the ground beside him, inches from his fingertips. Niall watched carefully, his heart quickening as Elle smiled at him as she turned to approach Sir Rakel. He struggled against his own instincts, mere seconds it would take for the old Elf to grab his sword and wipe Elle from this world, he prayed he was wrong. He was too far away now to help her. Trust me, she had asked. In a world where everyone she knew was gone or betrayed, she still believed in trust. She still loved this Elf even in his failure to protect her Father. He held his breath as she bid the Protector to rise and felt relief flood his heart as he watched them embrace, as a father would embrace his child after years apart. Satisfied, he relaxed as he watched Sir Rakel lift the Princess off her feet and sweep her around in circles, both laughing with relief and happiness. Niall felt a slight sting as he remembered his own Father, he would do anything to speak with him again.‘Sir- Sir Rakel?’ A weak voice sounded, puncturing the elation of the moment.‘Syren?’ Sir Rakel’s face brightened with enthusiasm, then flickered when he recognised the weakness and pain. She was trying desperately to stand, but to no avail, her legs were barely strong enough to move.‘Oh, my dear, what has happened to you?’ Sir Rakel moved to Syren’s side, Elle following miserably behind.‘It was all my fault.’ Elle mumbled miserably, crouching down to Syren.‘What happened?’ Sir Rakel asked again.‘The Captain attacked the village looking for me, I fought him off, he had Ayda.’ Elle explained.‘With your magic?’ The Protector asked quickly, Elle nodded, shocked.‘How do you know about her magic?’ Niall demanded suspiciously. Sir Rakel sighed.‘Of course, I knew, your Father knew you had magic.’ Sir Rakel said.‘Why-why didn’t he tell me?’ Elle asked.‘You were too young, and we never really knew how powerful you would become. It was better kept a secret. As you are now aware, The Elders do not take kindly to Mages.’‘If you knew they would do this, why did you not protect her? Protect Ayda? Protect the King and Queen?’ Niall burst out furiously.‘We didn’t think it would happen so soon. I am sorry for your Father, Princess, he made me promise to hide the Queen, to get his Queen to safety.’ Sir Rakel’s voice wavered.‘My Mother is safe?’ Elle exclaimed.‘Yes,’ Sir Rakel responded. ‘I thought you would know, she sent me to you.’‘Where is she? We must go to her!’‘We cannot go, I must get you to the Temple.’‘Why?’‘Because when I was young, my best friend was sent there in secret, smuggled from the city,’ Sir Rakel began, ‘He met with a Scholar at the Temple who taught him to control his gift. If we can find this Scholar, he can help you with yours.’‘You mean my Father,’ Elle said, ‘This Scholar taught my Father to use his magic,’ Sir Rakel nodded. Syren tried to smother a whine as pain engulfed her. Sir Rakel ended the conversation, explaining that they needed to move on as quickly as possible. Together they bound Niall’s gatherings into a make-shift litter and cleverly attached wheels from an abandoned cart. Carefully lifting Syren into it, Niall admired their handiwork. The litter looked like a tiny box on wheels, complete with walls and roof, in her weakened state, they decided to make it as protected as possible. It wasn’t perfect, and her feet were dangling slightly out of it, but it would have to do. With encouragement and assistance, Elle was lifted by her Knight onto the saddle of his huge stallion, named Trojan, and she followed on as they carried Syren away from the ruins of the village. Elle looked tiny seated upon the beast, her head bobbing with each mountainous step. They moved slowly and silently, straining from the effort of pulling the litter, careful not to disturb Syren’s broken body too much.‘Ayda!’ Elle called with glee. Finally, they were together. Ayda was flying on her horse faster than anything Niall had ever seen. He hardly caught a glimpse of her as she leapt from her horse and careered towards her sister smothering her with affection. She had eyes only for her sister. Theo and Karl approached soon after. Theo was sporting a bruised face, Niall noticed as he greeted his friend.‘What happened to you?’ He asked.‘The little Princess happened. She knocked me out when I tried to restrain her.’ Theo explained quietly.‘You got beaten by a child?’ Niall laughed, ‘Pathetic.’‘She has magic!’ Theo exclaimed, abashed. Elle tore herself away from her sister and jumped into Theo, apologising for her attack on him. Niall watched as Sir Rakel once again got down on one knee as Ayda recognised him. Silence followed as a resounding SMACK echoed through the air. Ayda had smacked Sir Rakel around the face. Niall leapt in to save him.‘Where were you!’ She shrieked, her eyes flashing fire. She rounded on him again, Niall grabbed her.‘I’m sorry Princess, I had to follow my orders!’ Sir Rakel pleaded, tears brimming his eyes, he had the good sense to stay kneeled.‘Is that why you are here? To kill us like you killed him!’ She howled. The effort of restraining her was akin to keeping a predator from its prey.‘No! I never killed him! I loved your Father!’‘You left him to die! You were supposed to protect him!’‘Ayda stop! Listen to him!’ Elle said loudly and firmly. All eyes were drawn to the small Elf.‘We should kill him Elle, he cannot be trusted!’ Ayda hissed.‘Yes, you should kill me, for I have wanted nothing more since leaving my King. But let me explain!’ Sir Rakel said, defeated. Ayda was still ricocheting in Niall’s arms, it was becoming increasingly difficult to hold her. Finally, she broke free, smashing Niall in the face she floored him, and ran full pelt at Sir Rakel.‘No more,’ Elle said simply. Elle raised her hand and stopped her sister dead. Ayda could not move. Her eyes darted from Sir Rakel to Elle in horror. She was frozen mid-run like a statue.‘I’m sorry Ayda,’ Elle whispered, ‘There has been enough hate, listen to what he has to say. Please.’ Sir Rakel repeated his explanation to the newcomers. He explained the King’s knowledge of power and how he was taught in secret by a Scholar at the Temple. He explained the King’s suspicions of Brielle, their long conversations about her power. The promise he made to his beloved friend, to protect his wife, his Queen above all else. Sir Rakel confessed his battle, he wanted to protect the Princesses but was torn between his conscience and his command. Sir Rakel expressed his remorse that one part of the King’s plan had failed. The King had planned on getting the Princesses and training Brielle himself, but had underestimated the Legion. In the end he and Sir Morcei had managed to sneak the Queen out of the City with a band of loyal Protectors. She was now safely in hiding in the Pearl Mountains with her Guard, presumed buried beneath the rubble of the Castle.‘Mother would not have left without us.’ Elle said simply, releasing Ayda from her state. Ayda stood, watching Sir Rakel with a calculating look.‘No. We had to slip something in her drink that night, so she had no choice.’ Sir Rakel chuckled sadly and pointed at the ghost of a bruise that had only recently healed around his eye, ‘She gave me this when she realised what I had done.’‘As soon as she heard the Legion were still searching for you, and that you escaped the City, she sent me to find you.’ Sir Rakel finished.‘Are we going to her?’ Ayda asked, hope getting the better of her.‘No, I am to take you both North, to the Temple of Scholars, so Elle can begin her education.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘No, she isn’t.’ Ayda commanded firmly. Sir Rakel looked abashed and confused.‘Have you not heard –’ He began.‘Yes, I have heard. The Scholars work with the Elders. I would not trust the Scholars with Brielle, and I do not trust you.’ Ayda said firmly.‘Yes, the Scholars work closely with the Elders, but there is one that does not. The same one who trained your Father.’‘According to you! How do I know this is not all lies!?’ Ayda demanded. Niall could understand her mistrust. She had been shocked and deeply hurt by the betrayal of the Patrol, and by the Guards of the Castle who had turned on her family. He guessed she did not want to put her faith in this Protector, for fear that this time, the betrayal would kill her.‘I have only my word.’ Sir Rakel finished, his hand upon his heart and his head bowed. For the first time, Ayda glimpsed the litter behind them, rested on the ground. Anger flickered from her face replaced by weary curiosity.‘What is that?’ She spat, pointing.‘It’s Syren.’",

      "content": "10 – NIALLShe was heartbroken. Her eyes were glassy and her lips trembling. Her face was paler than ever. He thought she was beautiful still. He shook the thought from his head. What was the point in harbouring such thoughts and feelings? She despised him, it felt like he was walking on egg shells around her, always having to be careful what to say or do. It annoyed him. She was so much like the girl he remembered, ferocious, loyal and caring. But she was so serious. He guessed that anybody would be serious if they had been through what they had. She had lost everything, after all. Niall never shared with anyone his concerns. They continued to plod further north, everyone knowing there was nothing for them north, but equally no one knowing what else to do. The aim was to keep moving and get the Legion off their trail, until someone had a better plan. He sighed, he was pretty sure this light bulb moment was further in the distance than they had time for. It had been days since they had left Syren behind. Ayda had hardly spoken to anyone except for Elle, who seemed equally distraught at Syren’s abandonment. It must be terrible for them, he thought, knowing that their own Protectors, their own people had all turned on them, and now finally, their very last elven friend had left them too. He felt partly responsible, if they had left, Syren would still be with her. But he could not leave them. Ayda had always been with him from the moment he took her in, his mind had always been with her, and now she was here, he felt he had purpose again. Then there was Elle, like a little sister to him, she was so special, so sweet and pure, he could not leave her. He felt as though the world could change with these two. Together they were so strong, so fearless, he felt a surge of pride as he thought that after all they had been through and were yet to go through they were standing together, as surely as ever. Alone in their mourning, alone in their fear. It reminded him very much of the companionship he had with his brothers. The five of them were so lucky that in the face of it all they had such strength in their relationship they were the toughest of allies. It was just a shame that Syren could not see it.The further north they progressed the colder it became. The luscious green pastures they had been travelling through had become hard and crisp, green grass had been replaced with white frost. There was no snow yet, but he felt sure that soon a thick, fluffy, sparkling blanket would settle around them. He could not deny it’s beauty, each morning, he would awaken, stiff and uncomfortable to see frozen droplets glittering from trees and a light mist floating in the distance. There was something magical about it. Theo’s leg had vastly improved and had managed to steal several warm winter cloaks that were left hanging outside people’s homes. They had passed several empty villages, all void of life, and managed to scrape together some essentials. Wrapped up as warm as they could with some supplies, they had continued. Ayda had been concerned about the villages, according to her, the only abandoned villages they would find would be at the Wastes. She was upset to find so many lifeless dwellings. It had made the group nervous. Had the people fled the winter, or were they forcibly removed? Was something circling them like a hawk circles its prey? They had no way of knowing.‘Fire!’ Elle squeaked from the middle of the group. This time she was riding with Theo on his white stallion. Niall had suggested she sit with each of them in turn, to save any one horse from excess weight every day. Elle had agreed but had expressed her desire for her own horse to care for. So, Niall had promised that the first horse they could get for her, she would have. Niall looked where the young Princess was pointing, there was indeed smoke rising in the distance.‘Could it be a village?’ Niall asked Ayda, who seemed to know this area quite well. She nodded, concern in her eyes.‘It could be a trap.’ Karl said sternly.‘I agree, we should avoid it.’ Niall nodded.‘If it’s my people, I will help them,’ Ayda announced firmly.‘And me!’ Piped up Elle.‘Well, you’ll never know, because we’re going arou- where do you think you’re going!?’ Niall called, Ayda had galloped off in the direction of the fire.‘God damn it! She wants us to protect her, but the only thing she needs protecting from is her stupidity,’ He cursed, they chased after her. It was a town, another white stone town. Elves were screaming and running in a frenzy from burning homes, the stone that held their town together was cracking and smashing as it was assaulted by blast upon blast by thrown explosives. Thankfully Ayda stopped as the group re-joined her just out of sight.‘What’s going on?’ Niall hissed.‘It’s the Legion, they’re attacking the town.’ Ayda whispered, her voice crushed as she watched her people brutally battered by the soldiers. Each soldier was clad head to toe in red, with black armour covering every inch of his body.‘We need to leave!’ Karl growled, taking in the scene before him.‘There aren’t many of them – we can take them!’ Ayda said defiantly.‘You just said it’s the Legion, you know, the ones that want to kill you!’ Niall said, outraged. Here he was risking his neck to keep her and her sister alive and now she just wanted to hand herself over to the people who want her dead.‘They’re our people Niall!’‘We’re NOT going in there!’‘If it was your people what would you do?’ Ayda demanded.‘I thought you said the Legion had magic?’‘Only the Captain, these are just soldiers!’‘Oh, should be a piece of piss then, just a normal fight with trained swords and no magic!’ Niall replied sarcastically.‘I’m going to save my people, do what you want!’ Ayda spat, bored of the argument. Pelting away from the group she ran full throttle into the town. Swearing loudly and shouting quick instructions to Theo to keep Elle away, he and Karl bolted after her. Niall watched, impressed, just as Ayda flew from her horse, and smashed a shocked soldier into the flames, rock fell, and he was crushed instantly. A second soldier died moments later, as Ayda pounced upon him and thrust her blade through the eye of his mask. Riding into the chaos, Niall smashed the hilt of his sword into the face of a passing soldier as Karl ran one through. As soon as they were close enough, they jumped from their horses and ran to Ayda’s side just as she had finished another soldier with a vicious slice to his throat. She kept crying out to the towns people, begging them to run. But with the sight of her something in the balance had changed. Several men picked up blades from the fallen and rushed to fight by her side. Soon, a small battalion had formed around her of Elves standing their ground slashing their way together through the soldiers. Many towns people fell, bleeding, they were not much use against the armour and training of the Legion’s Soldiers. Ayda felt her heart swell with pride, fighting beside her people. They had not all abandoned her. Ayda heard Niall laugh with relief as he finished the final soldier. The Elves before her cheered and celebrated their victory, then many turned to the wounded and dying, and the utter pain of defeat hit them. Niall stepped closer to Ayda has she was approached.‘Princess, it’s good to see you – but you should not have come.’ An older Elf with wispy hair, knelt to her and took her hand.‘It is good to see you too Sir -?’‘I am Aran, your Highness.’ He kissed her hand.‘Are you the leader here?’ She asked.‘No, your Highness, our Lord fled long ago, he heard of the raids on villages, knew they were heading here.’ Aran said.‘He just left you all here?’ Ayda responded, aghast.‘Of course, he fears the Legion. I must say, we would all be dead now if it wasn’t for you and your – ah – comrades. Humans?!’ Aran’s pleasure turned to panic as he saw Niall and Karl.‘Aran,’ Ayda stepped before them, ‘These are friends, they have done much to protect me.’Aran eyed them both suspiciously. Niall felt the Elves around them watching him closely. He puffed up with pleasure as he saw Ayda step into defend them and refer to them as friends. Maybe she was starting to trust him after all? Aran could not seem to take his eyes of him. He was a short, stocky Elf, who’s dirty farmer’s clothes did not suit the heavy metal sword in his hand.‘Aran, is there any news? Why are they raiding villages here?’ Ayda asked quickly. Niall knew she was keen to move on, news would spread, and retribution would be swift, she did not want to get caught here.‘They know you are in the area my Princess, they are ruthless in their hunt for you and Princess Brielle,’ Aran asked, his eyes snapping back to her.‘Yet you remain loyal to my family? Why?’ Ayda asked politely.‘The King ruled in peace and brought prosperity to Myrliar, The Legion undo all of his honourable work. We will remember him. He would not have stood for all this bloodshed. The Elders deserve no loyalty after what they have done.’Ayda replied, ‘I thank you, but you must all leave, they will return.’‘You are most kind, your Highness, but I fear we will all die, wherever we go.’ Niall followed Ayda, as they searched the town for their horses. Bodies littered the ground, soldier and town people alike, the white paved streets were bleeding. Niall felt his heart ache as he watched the distress shadowing Ayda’s face as she heard her people crying in pain. She was kind, he saw. Every so often she would help put out fires and hold the hands of dying elves, offering what condolences she could. Finally, they found each of their horses on route. Leading them back to the main group of Elves to bid their farewell and wish them luck.‘Farewell, Princess, best of luck. We are all with you.’ Aran said enthusiastically, kneeling once more. Just as the three of them turned to leave, a cold cruel voice sounded from the other side of the town square. Looking up Niall’s blood turned to ice as he saw what he had feared the most. A blood red cloak was sweeping across the stone paves, soaking blood up as it went. A silver half mask covered the face of the wearer, his crooked black teeth smiling evilly at them.‘Princess Ayda, it’s wonderful to see you here.’ His voice was sickeningly smooth, like wine laced with poison. This man emanated power. He stood alone, but confident, the world around him seemed to bend to his will as he moved ever closer to them.‘Run, Princess, run! We’ll distract him.’ Aran whispered to them. Niall admired the man’s courage. Surely, he knew he would stand no chance against a Captain of the Legion. Niall didn’t know what to do, he had only heard about the Captains from Elle, but he knew he had magic. He could almost sense it glowing from him. He knew their swords were going to be no more than feathers to this man.‘You know, there is nowhere for you to run your Highness. Where is your sister?’ The man gloated.‘I’d die before I told you!’ Ayda spat. Niall resisted the urge to grab her, she sounded so strong, but he could see her trembling as their death approached.‘Oh, you will die, but I have soldiers searching around this town right now, so you can watch me kill her first.’ The Captain could hardly contain his glee. His black crooked teeth had been showing since his arrival, he could not stop grinning like a cat that has cornered a mouse.‘She’s nowhere near here you fool!’ Ayda laughed convincingly.‘You mean to tell me you abandoned her? Never. You’ll be keeping her close by.’ He seethed.Niall thought quickly, they would find her for sure. She wasn’t too far away, and Theo was not going to be able to protect her against so many foes alone. They had to buy them some time. Thankfully, Ayda seemed to have come to the same conclusion. Moving away from Niall and Karl she was pacing closer to the Captain, his gaze following her unblinkingly. From the corner of his eye, Niall could see a small boy crouched, hiding a few yards from him. Slowly, he moved over, careful not to draw attention. The Captain’s eyes were stuck on Ayda like a wolf hunting its prey. He reached the boy, and out of the corner of his mouth he spoke.‘I need you to do something urgently for me.’ Niall whispered. The boy’s big eyes were wide with fear.‘I need you to take a message to Princess Brielle for me.’ He continued. He hoped the boy was loyal to the Princesses, this was a huge risk, but he had to get them away from here. The boy, although afraid, nodded.‘Tell her a Captain is here, he is searching for her, she must flee. My friend Theo will be with her. Go with them, they will keep you safe.’ He whispered instructions on how to find the Princess, and the boy snuck quickly and quietly from the town, in the wrong direction. Niall had instructed him not to go straight there, to make sure he wasn’t easily followed. Niall hadn’t noticed that a few of the town folk had moved, led by Aran, slowly and carefully through the burnt-out buildings closer and closer to the Captain. Niall watched them with fascination. They had planned this and moved without so much as a flicker of acknowledgement from the Captain. Was he that focussed on Ayda? Suddenly, the men ran from their hiding spots as one, their swords raised, screaming “For the King!” He had noticed them. He didn’t hesitate as he swung his arms in the air, the men rose helplessly like puppets before he flung them against a nearby building. With a nasty crunch, the men slid down the wall and landed in a pile on the ground, unmoving, not even a breath. Niall spied Aran’s face at the bottom of the pile, his face was as fixed with determination in death as it had been in life. Shock shook Niall, what chance did any of them have against a monster that powerful?‘Niall, move, quickly!’ Karl snapped, jabbing him in the ribs. Niall noticed with a pang that Ayda was gone. He let Karl lead him away as he scanned the area for her, he couldn’t see her anywhere.‘Does the Captain have her?’ He asked urgently. Karl shook his head, everyone had used the scuffle to flee the town hall and hide. A loud crack resonated through the air, peering around a corner, he glimpsed the Captain blasting everything out of the way in his fury to find her.‘We have to find her!’ Niall whispered, ducking as another crash sounded. They ran, amidst the chaos as buildings around them exploded, trapping fleeing civilians, the shrieking and smashing was thunderous. A woman yards from them flew off her feet as she caught the sight of the Captain, who laughed wickedly as she fell into flame. The Captain was calling for her. Niall tried to keep him in eye sight as much as he could whilst searching for the Princess.‘Oh no,’ He said, aghast. The Captain had grown bored of smashing things and had instead woven magic into the form of five great silver wolves. The same wolves that had hunted them nights before.‘Climb, climb!’ Niall roared to everyone around him. He and Karl climbed rubble onto the nearest roof, helping as many as they could. The wolves were ravaging anyone they could find. Karl leapt onto another roof top, Niall followed. Scouting around looking for Ayda, finally they saw her. Thankfully she had also managed to escape the jaws of the giant wolves rampaging their way through the town. Blood curdling screams filled the air as the wolves continued to find their victims. Niall dared not call out to her. He couldn’t bear to see these enemies press down on her. He nudged Karl and nodded in her direction. Slowly and carefully, staying on the roof tops, they climbed over to her. Then it happened, in a split second, Ayda was thrown into the air like a doll. The Captain had found her. Niall watched in terror as her body zoomed through the air and was caught roughly by the throat. She kicked and squirmed as his nails dug into her neck.‘No!’ Niall roared. The wolves around them disappeared into white smoke, they were no longer needed, the Captain had what he wanted. Niall threw himself off the rooftop and sprinted to her faster than he had ever ran in his life. He could not defeat this man, he knew that, but he had to do something. Niall shouted for her as he reached them. Turning his head, the Captain grinned wickedly at Niall and snapped his fingers together. Immediately Niall’s body froze, his legs and arms were pinned, he fell forwards with the momentum of his run and landed face first on the cold hard slabs. The Captain turned and walked away from him, his hand still around Ayda’s throat, carrying her as if she were lighter than air. Niall felt himself being turned over and dragged unceremoniously away. Karl roughly sat him against a wall.‘There’s nothing we can do brother!’ Karl growled as he slapped him. Niall still could not move but he could see. He watched helplessly, his eyes stinging as Ayda was carried away. He had almost given up hope when… BANG. The Captain stumbled back. BANG. Pushed back again, the Captain lost his hold on Ayda, she stumbled, and crawled desperately away from him. An invisible force was battering the Captain. His shield reverberated through the air, ripples showing in the invisible barrier around him. Shock was etched onto the Captain’s face as he spun around trying to find the source of this power. A grin grew across his face. Niall’s heart sank. Elle had come for her sister. She was walking like a girl much older than her years. A confidence born of anger and hatred, her face was twisted with a dark fury. Niall nursed a deep fear of her, her eyes were black as coal and unseeing. She did not appear to notice the destruction around her as her eyes fixed on the Captain in a deadly glare. Ayda was weeping, in pain or shock no-one knew, Niall wanted to call out to her, but he still couldn’t move. Karl was stuck to his side threateningly, ready to defend his friend against anything. He watched as Elle continued to move forward pelting the Captain with strike after strike, he was no longer stumbling, he expected her. His shield held firm as her attack continued, then finally she paused, measuring her target. He made the most of her hesitation and pushed his magic into the buildings next to her, they exploded all around her. Niall heard screaming ringing in his mind. Dust choked everyone, he couldn’t see her. Ayda had not moved from her spot, she looked ready to jump in to save her sister, but what could she do? The dust settled, and Elle emerged, she had conjured a shield and saved herself from the blast, to the amusement of the Captain and the surprised relief of everyone else.‘You are learning little one.’ He cajoled. Instantly sparks shot from his outstretched hands and electrified her shield, millions of ripples resounded through the air. Elle’s small face was scrunched up as she concentrated on her shield. Niall watched as white-hot flames burst out of her hand and surrounded the Captain in a blaze. Both mages continued to batter each-other fiercely, with none making a huge impact, blow after blow was blocked, their shields stood strong.‘Someone’s got to tire first. Let’s hope it’s not Elle.’ Karl grumbled. It couldn’t be Elle, Niall reassured himself. The Captain spent so much of his power on those fearsome wolves and blowing up this town, surely after Elle managed to bring down a Castle and kill every soldier there she must be stronger! His resolve began to falter as the battle ensued. Elle stopped attacking, her little angry face was screwed up and tight as she concentrated fully on her shield. A huge blast of power from the Captain quaked her shield and she stumbled backwards a few steps. She was losing. Her magic was failing. Ayda had spotted it too, as quickly as she could, she ran towards the Captain with her sword raised, roaring in desperation. The Captain didn’t even look at her as he waved his hand and sent her flying. She fell, motionless like a doll, to the floor beside them. Niall was furious, he still could not move, he couldn’t even call out to her and Karl was point blank refusing to leave him. Someone had to help her! Elle grew weaker and weaker by the second, slowly, his heart sank as her shield flickered and she slowly backed down to her knees, tears streaming from her eyes. It all happened at once. The Captain screamed out in pain as a dagger slid its way through his throat just before everything was thrown backwards in a sudden blast of power. Ringing sounded in his ears, dust filled the air. Then silence. Complete eerie silence. Was Elle alive? What had happened to the Captain? Instantly, the feeling in his arms and legs returned, he could move again. Clumsily he got to his feet, aided by Karl, who was covered in soot and dust. He ran over to Ayda and checked her, she was breathing but unconscious. Karl, being larger and stronger picked her up.‘Elle!’ Niall roared. He couldn’t see two feet in front of him. Hands outstretched he began to wade through the dust in the direction he last saw her. Finally, the dust began to settle. Everything was covered in a thin layer of white sand, bodies and bricks alike. The moment Niall saw her he ran to her, occasionally tripping over his new legs.‘Elle you’re OK. Thank the lord you’re OK!’ He sighed deeply with relief, hardly believing it. He made to hug her. She resisted him, gazing into the distance. “Ayda’s OK, we’ve got her, we need to go.”‘She saved me.’ Elle whispered in shock. Confused, Niall followed her gaze to a young woman unmoving on the ground not far from the dead Captain. The woman’s red hair was speckled with dust and debris. Syren.‘Oh no, no, no!’ Niall exclaimed rushing over to Syren’s limp form. Her eyes were open, her breathing was slow. Pain was written all over her pale and dusty face.‘Why did you do that?’ Elle whispered, she had followed Niall to Syren’s side. Syren reached out feebly for the young Princess’s hand.‘You and Ayda are my only family.’ Syren said weakly, breath catching in her throat. With that, Elle kissed her friend on the cheek and whispered something Niall could not hear. He examined the Elf’s body, there were a few scratches and slight bruises visible, but he feared the force of the blast from Elle had caused worse internal damage. There was no way for him to tell what was draining her of life, and he could not see how long she had left. They needed help. They needed a miracle. Wounds he could help to heal, but so little was known of internal injury. He could not help but fear the worst for the young ferocious Elf who had saved their lives. He looked at Ayda, lying in Karl’s arms, and felt his heart hit the floor. How could anyone explain to her that after all she had lost, she was to now lose her dearest friend?‘What do we do?’ Karl asked quietly.‘I don’t know if she can be moved, but we can’t stay here.’ Niall responded, stroking Elle’s hair as she watched over Syren’s frail frame.‘Karl,’ Niall said, standing to look at this friend. ‘Take the Princesses and find Theo, I’m going to stay with Syren.’‘She won’t last, come with us. There’s no point you getting yourself into danger.’ Karl replied firmly.‘I’m not leaving her here alone,’ Niall snapped, ‘She deserves more than that.’ Karl stood resolute. He was not leaving Niall alone. Niall looked at Syren, he had never appreciated her, she had been frustrating and dismissive to him and his friends, but she had been steadfast in their goal. She had risked her life protecting her family, and he could not forget that. Surely, now, they could at last, put race behind them and move on? Syren’s eyes were locked on his. Her eyes once bright, alert and alarming, were now tired and red, betraying the broken body they concealed.‘Leave me,’ She whispered. ‘Keep them safe.’ Niall considered Elle. She was sat, staring at him, her face pale and sickly. Surprisingly, there were no tears. He doubted the poor girl had many tears left to shed after all she had seen and learned. He could not leave Syren, Elle and Ayda would hate him forever. He knew however, that staying here with Syren kept Ayda and Elle at risk, the Legion would come, and they would stand no chance fighting them off now. His heart felt bruised and battered that whichever path he chose, Ayda would forever hate him. He had to make the right decision for everyone.‘I can’t.’ Niall replied, ‘You’re coming with us.’Syren gave a feeble laugh and shook her head, ‘I cannot move, I am too weak.’‘We will carry you.’‘I am dying.’ Syren said matter-of-factly. Niall marvelled at her courage, to throw yourself in harm’s way for those you love and be aware of the price you will pay was admirable. He could not fail to respect her for that.‘Ayda will want to say goodbye, but here, we are all at risk.’ Niall said sadly, kneeling by her side once more. Syren nodded, understanding. He felt uncomfortable at delivering the final message but knew it would do the trick. Syren would do anything for Ayda, that much she had proven.‘Karl, find Theo, we’ll need all the help we can find.’ Niall requested. Karl finally nodded, and carrying Ayda, retreated out of the destroyed village. Elle would not leave Syren’s side, she had not let go of her friend’s hand. Niall decided to leave them alone, he wandered into the nearest wreckage to seek scraps of crates or carts for a make shift litter. He pondered his decision, it would undoubtedly be uncomfortable for Syren, but he could not leave her here alone and he could not risk the Princesses’ safety. Sighing, he collected anything useful he could find, steeling his heart against the broken bodies of villagers lying in the aftermath. Many minutes passed, and he had collected several decent sized planks of wood and lengths of rope.‘Niall!’ He heard Elle shout for him. Then he heard it, distantly he could hear the thunder of hooves pounding the ground. Someone was approaching the village. Niall dashed faster than lightning back to the square. Syren and Elle had somehow managed to shimmy Syren up against a wall, where she was now resting, Elle beside her. Niall stood before them, dropping his collection to the ground nearby, his fist firmly clenching the hilt of his sword, ready to meet the traveller. The horse was a huge, monstrously built black stallion, Niall would guess eighteen hands high, and was armoured in gold matching it’s rider. The rider was head to toe in gold, Niall felt a shiver of remembrance as he took in the stance, and the emblem adorning the golden armour. The Royal Emblem. Niall remembered seeing such armour many years ago when he bid farewell to a young and sad Princess. Niall heard Elle gasp and run to stand beside him.‘It’s Sir Rakel! My Father’s Protector!’ She whispered excitedly. Niall had to stop himself from pointing out that Sir Rakel had not done a particularly good job of protecting the King, seeing as he had been nowhere around at the time of the King’s brutal murder. The horse was approaching ever nearer.‘Stop!’ Niall called out confidently with his sword raised, pushing Elle back with the other hand.‘What are you doing?’ Elle squealed.‘I do not know I can trust him!’ Niall murmured to her, pushing her gently backwards, not lowering his sword arm.‘Peace, boy!’ The rider called out to him, slowing and stopping at a respectful distance.‘What business do you have here?’ Niall responded clearly.‘I have been tracking your party for days, I am here for their Royal Highnesses,’ Sir Rakel called.‘They are no longer here, they have left this village as you see it.’ Niall bluffed feebly.‘Do not try to insult me, for I see young Princess Brielle behind you.’ Sir Rakel laughed, as he dismounted his stallion proudly. He walked confidently closer to them, his gauntleted hands raised in front of him in surrender.‘I would recognise that young Elf anywhere.’ He said proudly, removing his helm and smiling kindly at her as he approached.‘Sir Rakel would never hurt me.’ Elle pleaded with Niall. She was the happiest he had ever seen her, he face was glowing with excitement as she watched Sir Rakel approach. Niall was at a loss, this man he knew to be the same Elf that had rescued Ayda, and he was here, a typical Knight in Shining Armour to protect Elle. But something was amiss, how had this Elf tracked them for so long to now conveniently find them when they were so much weakened. He kept his sword high.‘You are right not to trust me human,’ Sir Rakel said, ‘I know what happened at the Stone Castle, the betrayal my dear King suffered. I am not your enemy.’‘I would not trust anyone with the Princess.’ Niall spat, the niceties had vanished. Sir Rakel growled as he drew his own sword and raised it in challenge. Niall could see the Elf was much older than he, his hair was white, and skin was slightly creased. Niall had always admired the way Elves were spared the fate of time and aged much slower than humans. Despite the difference in age, Niall disliked the odds, this Elf was wiser and heavily armoured. He would not likely win this alone.‘I have known the Princess since she was a babe, and her Father was always my brother, I would ask how I can trust a human with one so precious to me!’‘Stop it!’ Elle screeched, ignoring Niall’s protests she moved between them her hands outstretched. Immediately, Sir Rakel bowed down to one knee, in a gesture of obedience Niall had never seen before. Sensing the danger had passed with Brielle’s intervention, Niall lowered his sword slightly as Elle approached him.‘I know you are trying to protect me. You must learn to trust me, as I do you. You cannot harm this Elf without harming me.’ Brielle said kindly and confidently, her eyes were blazing with emotion. This old soldier meant a lot to her, he could see. He sheathed his sword, glaring at the Golden Protector. Sir Rakel was still bowed on one knee, his sword on the ground beside him, inches from his fingertips. Niall watched carefully, his heart quickening as Elle smiled at him as she turned to approach Sir Rakel. He struggled against his own instincts, mere seconds it would take for the old Elf to grab his sword and wipe Elle from this world, he prayed he was wrong. He was too far away now to help her. Trust me, she had asked. In a world where everyone she knew was gone or betrayed, she still believed in trust. She still loved this Elf even in his failure to protect her Father. He held his breath as she bid the Protector to rise and felt relief flood his heart as he watched them embrace, as a father would embrace his child after years apart. Satisfied, he relaxed as he watched Sir Rakel lift the Princess off her feet and sweep her around in circles, both laughing with relief and happiness. Niall felt a slight sting as he remembered his own Father, he would do anything to speak with him again.‘Sir- Sir Rakel?’ A weak voice sounded, puncturing the elation of the moment.‘Syren?’ Sir Rakel’s face brightened with enthusiasm, then flickered when he recognised the weakness and pain. She was trying desperately to stand, but to no avail, her legs were barely strong enough to move.‘Oh, my dear, what has happened to you?’ Sir Rakel moved to Syren’s side, Elle following miserably behind.‘It was all my fault.’ Elle mumbled miserably, crouching down to Syren.‘What happened?’ Sir Rakel asked again.‘The Captain attacked the village looking for me, I fought him off, he had Ayda.’ Elle explained.‘With your magic?’ The Protector asked quickly, Elle nodded, shocked.‘How do you know about her magic?’ Niall demanded suspiciously. Sir Rakel sighed.‘Of course, I knew, your Father knew you had magic.’ Sir Rakel said.‘Why-why didn’t he tell me?’ Elle asked.‘You were too young, and we never really knew how powerful you would become. It was better kept a secret. As you are now aware, The Elders do not take kindly to Mages.’‘If you knew they would do this, why did you not protect her? Protect Ayda? Protect the King and Queen?’ Niall burst out furiously.‘We didn’t think it would happen so soon. I am sorry for your Father, Princess, he made me promise to hide the Queen, to get his Queen to safety.’ Sir Rakel’s voice wavered.‘My Mother is safe?’ Elle exclaimed.‘Yes,’ Sir Rakel responded. ‘I thought you would know, she sent me to you.’‘Where is she? We must go to her!’‘We cannot go, I must get you to the Temple.’‘Why?’‘Because when I was young, my best friend was sent there in secret, smuggled from the city,’ Sir Rakel began, ‘He met with a Scholar at the Temple who taught him to control his gift. If we can find this Scholar, he can help you with yours.’‘You mean my Father,’ Elle said, ‘This Scholar taught my Father to use his magic,’ Sir Rakel nodded. Syren tried to smother a whine as pain engulfed her. Sir Rakel ended the conversation, explaining that they needed to move on as quickly as possible. Together they bound Niall’s gatherings into a make-shift litter and cleverly attached wheels from an abandoned cart. Carefully lifting Syren into it, Niall admired their handiwork. The litter looked like a tiny box on wheels, complete with walls and roof, in her weakened state, they decided to make it as protected as possible. It wasn’t perfect, and her feet were dangling slightly out of it, but it would have to do. With encouragement and assistance, Elle was lifted by her Knight onto the saddle of his huge stallion, named Trojan, and she followed on as they carried Syren away from the ruins of the village. Elle looked tiny seated upon the beast, her head bobbing with each mountainous step. They moved slowly and silently, straining from the effort of pulling the litter, careful not to disturb Syren’s broken body too much.‘Ayda!’ Elle called with glee. Finally, they were together. Ayda was flying on her horse faster than anything Niall had ever seen. He hardly caught a glimpse of her as she leapt from her horse and careered towards her sister smothering her with affection. She had eyes only for her sister. Theo and Karl approached soon after. Theo was sporting a bruised face, Niall noticed as he greeted his friend.‘What happened to you?’ He asked.‘The little Princess happened. She knocked me out when I tried to restrain her.’ Theo explained quietly.‘You got beaten by a child?’ Niall laughed, ‘Pathetic.’‘She has magic!’ Theo exclaimed, abashed. Elle tore herself away from her sister and jumped into Theo, apologising for her attack on him. Niall watched as Sir Rakel once again got down on one knee as Ayda recognised him. Silence followed as a resounding SMACK echoed through the air. Ayda had smacked Sir Rakel around the face. Niall leapt in to save him.‘Where were you!’ She shrieked, her eyes flashing fire. She rounded on him again, Niall grabbed her.‘I’m sorry Princess, I had to follow my orders!’ Sir Rakel pleaded, tears brimming his eyes, he had the good sense to stay kneeled.‘Is that why you are here? To kill us like you killed him!’ She howled. The effort of restraining her was akin to keeping a predator from its prey.‘No! I never killed him! I loved your Father!’‘You left him to die! You were supposed to protect him!’‘Ayda stop! Listen to him!’ Elle said loudly and firmly. All eyes were drawn to the small Elf.‘We should kill him Elle, he cannot be trusted!’ Ayda hissed.‘Yes, you should kill me, for I have wanted nothing more since leaving my King. But let me explain!’ Sir Rakel said, defeated. Ayda was still ricocheting in Niall’s arms, it was becoming increasingly difficult to hold her. Finally, she broke free, smashing Niall in the face she floored him, and ran full pelt at Sir Rakel.‘No more,’ Elle said simply. Elle raised her hand and stopped her sister dead. Ayda could not move. Her eyes darted from Sir Rakel to Elle in horror. She was frozen mid-run like a statue.‘I’m sorry Ayda,’ Elle whispered, ‘There has been enough hate, listen to what he has to say. Please.’ Sir Rakel repeated his explanation to the newcomers. He explained the King’s knowledge of power and how he was taught in secret by a Scholar at the Temple. He explained the King’s suspicions of Brielle, their long conversations about her power. The promise he made to his beloved friend, to protect his wife, his Queen above all else. Sir Rakel confessed his battle, he wanted to protect the Princesses but was torn between his conscience and his command. Sir Rakel expressed his remorse that one part of the King’s plan had failed. The King had planned on getting the Princesses and training Brielle himself, but had underestimated the Legion. In the end he and Sir Morcei had managed to sneak the Queen out of the City with a band of loyal Protectors. She was now safely in hiding in the Pearl Mountains with her Guard, presumed buried beneath the rubble of the Castle.‘Mother would not have left without us.’ Elle said simply, releasing Ayda from her state. Ayda stood, watching Sir Rakel with a calculating look.‘No. We had to slip something in her drink that night, so she had no choice.’ Sir Rakel chuckled sadly and pointed at the ghost of a bruise that had only recently healed around his eye, ‘She gave me this when she realised what I had done.’‘As soon as she heard the Legion were still searching for you, and that you escaped the City, she sent me to find you.’ Sir Rakel finished.‘Are we going to her?’ Ayda asked, hope getting the better of her.‘No, I am to take you both North, to the Temple of Scholars, so Elle can begin her education.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘No, she isn’t.’ Ayda commanded firmly. Sir Rakel looked abashed and confused.‘Have you not heard –’ He began.‘Yes, I have heard. The Scholars work with the Elders. I would not trust the Scholars with Brielle, and I do not trust you.’ Ayda said firmly.‘Yes, the Scholars work closely with the Elders, but there is one that does not. The same one who trained your Father.’‘According to you! How do I know this is not all lies!?’ Ayda demanded. Niall could understand her mistrust. She had been shocked and deeply hurt by the betrayal of the Patrol, and by the Guards of the Castle who had turned on her family. He guessed she did not want to put her faith in this Protector, for fear that this time, the betrayal would kill her.‘I have only my word.’ Sir Rakel finished, his hand upon his heart and his head bowed. For the first time, Ayda glimpsed the litter behind them, rested on the ground. Anger flickered from her face replaced by weary curiosity.‘What is that?’ She spat, pointing.‘It’s Syren.’",

      "content": "10 – NIALLShe was heartbroken. Her eyes were glassy and her lips trembling. Her face was paler than ever. He thought she was beautiful still. He shook the thought from his head. What was the point in harbouring such thoughts and feelings? She despised him, it felt like he was walking on egg shells around her, always having to be careful what to say or do. It annoyed him. She was so much like the girl he remembered, ferocious, loyal and caring. But she was so serious. He guessed that anybody would be serious if they had been through what they had. She had lost everything, after all. Niall never shared with anyone his concerns. They continued to plod further north, everyone knowing there was nothing for them north, but equally no one knowing what else to do. The aim was to keep moving and get the Legion off their trail, until someone had a better plan. He sighed, he was pretty sure this light bulb moment was further in the distance than they had time for. It had been days since they had left Syren behind. Ayda had hardly spoken to anyone except for Elle, who seemed equally distraught at Syren’s abandonment. It must be terrible for them, he thought, knowing that their own Protectors, their own people had all turned on them, and now finally, their very last elven friend had left them too. He felt partly responsible, if they had left, Syren would still be with her. But he could not leave them. Ayda had always been with him from the moment he took her in, his mind had always been with her, and now she was here, he felt he had purpose again. Then there was Elle, like a little sister to him, she was so special, so sweet and pure, he could not leave her. He felt as though the world could change with these two. Together they were so strong, so fearless, he felt a surge of pride as he thought that after all they had been through and were yet to go through they were standing together, as surely as ever. Alone in their mourning, alone in their fear. It reminded him very much of the companionship he had with his brothers. The five of them were so lucky that in the face of it all they had such strength in their relationship they were the toughest of allies. It was just a shame that Syren could not see it.The further north they progressed the colder it became. The luscious green pastures they had been travelling through had become hard and crisp, green grass had been replaced with white frost. There was no snow yet, but he felt sure that soon a thick, fluffy, sparkling blanket would settle around them. He could not deny it’s beauty, each morning, he would awaken, stiff and uncomfortable to see frozen droplets glittering from trees and a light mist floating in the distance. There was something magical about it. Theo’s leg had vastly improved and had managed to steal several warm winter cloaks that were left hanging outside people’s homes. They had passed several empty villages, all void of life, and managed to scrape together some essentials. Wrapped up as warm as they could with some supplies, they had continued. Ayda had been concerned about the villages, according to her, the only abandoned villages they would find would be at the Wastes. She was upset to find so many lifeless dwellings. It had made the group nervous. Had the people fled the winter, or were they forcibly removed? Was something circling them like a hawk circles its prey? They had no way of knowing.‘Fire!’ Elle squeaked from the middle of the group. This time she was riding with Theo on his white stallion. Niall had suggested she sit with each of them in turn, to save any one horse from excess weight every day. Elle had agreed but had expressed her desire for her own horse to care for. So, Niall had promised that the first horse they could get for her, she would have. Niall looked where the young Princess was pointing, there was indeed smoke rising in the distance.‘Could it be a village?’ Niall asked Ayda, who seemed to know this area quite well. She nodded, concern in her eyes.‘It could be a trap.’ Karl said sternly.‘I agree, we should avoid it.’ Niall nodded.‘If it’s my people, I will help them,’ Ayda announced firmly.‘And me!’ Piped up Elle.‘Well, you’ll never know, because we’re going arou- where do you think you’re going!?’ Niall called, Ayda had galloped off in the direction of the fire.‘God damn it! She wants us to protect her, but the only thing she needs protecting from is her stupidity,’ He cursed, they chased after her. It was a town, another white stone town. Elves were screaming and running in a frenzy from burning homes, the stone that held their town together was cracking and smashing as it was assaulted by blast upon blast by thrown explosives. Thankfully Ayda stopped as the group re-joined her just out of sight.‘What’s going on?’ Niall hissed.‘It’s the Legion, they’re attacking the town.’ Ayda whispered, her voice crushed as she watched her people brutally battered by the soldiers. Each soldier was clad head to toe in red, with black armour covering every inch of his body.‘We need to leave!’ Karl growled, taking in the scene before him.‘There aren’t many of them – we can take them!’ Ayda said defiantly.‘You just said it’s the Legion, you know, the ones that want to kill you!’ Niall said, outraged. Here he was risking his neck to keep her and her sister alive and now she just wanted to hand herself over to the people who want her dead.‘They’re our people Niall!’‘We’re NOT going in there!’‘If it was your people what would you do?’ Ayda demanded.‘I thought you said the Legion had magic?’‘Only the Captain, these are just soldiers!’‘Oh, should be a piece of piss then, just a normal fight with trained swords and no magic!’ Niall replied sarcastically.‘I’m going to save my people, do what you want!’ Ayda spat, bored of the argument. Pelting away from the group she ran full throttle into the town. Swearing loudly and shouting quick instructions to Theo to keep Elle away, he and Karl bolted after her. Niall watched, impressed, just as Ayda flew from her horse, and smashed a shocked soldier into the flames, rock fell, and he was crushed instantly. A second soldier died moments later, as Ayda pounced upon him and thrust her blade through the eye of his mask. Riding into the chaos, Niall smashed the hilt of his sword into the face of a passing soldier as Karl ran one through. As soon as they were close enough, they jumped from their horses and ran to Ayda’s side just as she had finished another soldier with a vicious slice to his throat. She kept crying out to the towns people, begging them to run. But with the sight of her something in the balance had changed. Several men picked up blades from the fallen and rushed to fight by her side. Soon, a small battalion had formed around her of Elves standing their ground slashing their way together through the soldiers. Many towns people fell, bleeding, they were not much use against the armour and training of the Legion’s Soldiers. Ayda felt her heart swell with pride, fighting beside her people. They had not all abandoned her. Ayda heard Niall laugh with relief as he finished the final soldier. The Elves before her cheered and celebrated their victory, then many turned to the wounded and dying, and the utter pain of defeat hit them. Niall stepped closer to Ayda has she was approached.‘Princess, it’s good to see you – but you should not have come.’ An older Elf with wispy hair, knelt to her and took her hand.‘It is good to see you too Sir -?’‘I am Aran, your Highness.’ He kissed her hand.‘Are you the leader here?’ She asked.‘No, your Highness, our Lord fled long ago, he heard of the raids on villages, knew they were heading here.’ Aran said.‘He just left you all here?’ Ayda responded, aghast.‘Of course, he fears the Legion. I must say, we would all be dead now if it wasn’t for you and your – ah – comrades. Humans?!’ Aran’s pleasure turned to panic as he saw Niall and Karl.‘Aran,’ Ayda stepped before them, ‘These are friends, they have done much to protect me.’Aran eyed them both suspiciously. Niall felt the Elves around them watching him closely. He puffed up with pleasure as he saw Ayda step into defend them and refer to them as friends. Maybe she was starting to trust him after all? Aran could not seem to take his eyes of him. He was a short, stocky Elf, who’s dirty farmer’s clothes did not suit the heavy metal sword in his hand.‘Aran, is there any news? Why are they raiding villages here?’ Ayda asked quickly. Niall knew she was keen to move on, news would spread, and retribution would be swift, she did not want to get caught here.‘They know you are in the area my Princess, they are ruthless in their hunt for you and Princess Brielle,’ Aran asked, his eyes snapping back to her.‘Yet you remain loyal to my family? Why?’ Ayda asked politely.‘The King ruled in peace and brought prosperity to Myrliar, The Legion undo all of his honourable work. We will remember him. He would not have stood for all this bloodshed. The Elders deserve no loyalty after what they have done.’Ayda replied, ‘I thank you, but you must all leave, they will return.’‘You are most kind, your Highness, but I fear we will all die, wherever we go.’ Niall followed Ayda, as they searched the town for their horses. Bodies littered the ground, soldier and town people alike, the white paved streets were bleeding. Niall felt his heart ache as he watched the distress shadowing Ayda’s face as she heard her people crying in pain. She was kind, he saw. Every so often she would help put out fires and hold the hands of dying elves, offering what condolences she could. Finally, they found each of their horses on route. Leading them back to the main group of Elves to bid their farewell and wish them luck.‘Farewell, Princess, best of luck. We are all with you.’ Aran said enthusiastically, kneeling once more. Just as the three of them turned to leave, a cold cruel voice sounded from the other side of the town square. Looking up Niall’s blood turned to ice as he saw what he had feared the most. A blood red cloak was sweeping across the stone paves, soaking blood up as it went. A silver half mask covered the face of the wearer, his crooked black teeth smiling evilly at them.‘Princess Ayda, it’s wonderful to see you here.’ His voice was sickeningly smooth, like wine laced with poison. This man emanated power. He stood alone, but confident, the world around him seemed to bend to his will as he moved ever closer to them.‘Run, Princess, run! We’ll distract him.’ Aran whispered to them. Niall admired the man’s courage. Surely, he knew he would stand no chance against a Captain of the Legion. Niall didn’t know what to do, he had only heard about the Captains from Elle, but he knew he had magic. He could almost sense it glowing from him. He knew their swords were going to be no more than feathers to this man.‘You know, there is nowhere for you to run your Highness. Where is your sister?’ The man gloated.‘I’d die before I told you!’ Ayda spat. Niall resisted the urge to grab her, she sounded so strong, but he could see her trembling as their death approached.‘Oh, you will die, but I have soldiers searching around this town right now, so you can watch me kill her first.’ The Captain could hardly contain his glee. His black crooked teeth had been showing since his arrival, he could not stop grinning like a cat that has cornered a mouse.‘She’s nowhere near here you fool!’ Ayda laughed convincingly.‘You mean to tell me you abandoned her? Never. You’ll be keeping her close by.’ He seethed.Niall thought quickly, they would find her for sure. She wasn’t too far away, and Theo was not going to be able to protect her against so many foes alone. They had to buy them some time. Thankfully, Ayda seemed to have come to the same conclusion. Moving away from Niall and Karl she was pacing closer to the Captain, his gaze following her unblinkingly. From the corner of his eye, Niall could see a small boy crouched, hiding a few yards from him. Slowly, he moved over, careful not to draw attention. The Captain’s eyes were stuck on Ayda like a wolf hunting its prey. He reached the boy, and out of the corner of his mouth he spoke.‘I need you to do something urgently for me.’ Niall whispered. The boy’s big eyes were wide with fear.‘I need you to take a message to Princess Brielle for me.’ He continued. He hoped the boy was loyal to the Princesses, this was a huge risk, but he had to get them away from here. The boy, although afraid, nodded.‘Tell her a Captain is here, he is searching for her, she must flee. My friend Theo will be with her. Go with them, they will keep you safe.’ He whispered instructions on how to find the Princess, and the boy snuck quickly and quietly from the town, in the wrong direction. Niall had instructed him not to go straight there, to make sure he wasn’t easily followed. Niall hadn’t noticed that a few of the town folk had moved, led by Aran, slowly and carefully through the burnt-out buildings closer and closer to the Captain. Niall watched them with fascination. They had planned this and moved without so much as a flicker of acknowledgement from the Captain. Was he that focussed on Ayda? Suddenly, the men ran from their hiding spots as one, their swords raised, screaming “For the King!” He had noticed them. He didn’t hesitate as he swung his arms in the air, the men rose helplessly like puppets before he flung them against a nearby building. With a nasty crunch, the men slid down the wall and landed in a pile on the ground, unmoving, not even a breath. Niall spied Aran’s face at the bottom of the pile, his face was as fixed with determination in death as it had been in life. Shock shook Niall, what chance did any of them have against a monster that powerful?‘Niall, move, quickly!’ Karl snapped, jabbing him in the ribs. Niall noticed with a pang that Ayda was gone. He let Karl lead him away as he scanned the area for her, he couldn’t see her anywhere.‘Does the Captain have her?’ He asked urgently. Karl shook his head, everyone had used the scuffle to flee the town hall and hide. A loud crack resonated through the air, peering around a corner, he glimpsed the Captain blasting everything out of the way in his fury to find her.‘We have to find her!’ Niall whispered, ducking as another crash sounded. They ran, amidst the chaos as buildings around them exploded, trapping fleeing civilians, the shrieking and smashing was thunderous. A woman yards from them flew off her feet as she caught the sight of the Captain, who laughed wickedly as she fell into flame. The Captain was calling for her. Niall tried to keep him in eye sight as much as he could whilst searching for the Princess.‘Oh no,’ He said, aghast. The Captain had grown bored of smashing things and had instead woven magic into the form of five great silver wolves. The same wolves that had hunted them nights before.‘Climb, climb!’ Niall roared to everyone around him. He and Karl climbed rubble onto the nearest roof, helping as many as they could. The wolves were ravaging anyone they could find. Karl leapt onto another roof top, Niall followed. Scouting around looking for Ayda, finally they saw her. Thankfully she had also managed to escape the jaws of the giant wolves rampaging their way through the town. Blood curdling screams filled the air as the wolves continued to find their victims. Niall dared not call out to her. He couldn’t bear to see these enemies press down on her. He nudged Karl and nodded in her direction. Slowly and carefully, staying on the roof tops, they climbed over to her. Then it happened, in a split second, Ayda was thrown into the air like a doll. The Captain had found her. Niall watched in terror as her body zoomed through the air and was caught roughly by the throat. She kicked and squirmed as his nails dug into her neck.‘No!’ Niall roared. The wolves around them disappeared into white smoke, they were no longer needed, the Captain had what he wanted. Niall threw himself off the rooftop and sprinted to her faster than he had ever ran in his life. He could not defeat this man, he knew that, but he had to do something. Niall shouted for her as he reached them. Turning his head, the Captain grinned wickedly at Niall and snapped his fingers together. Immediately Niall’s body froze, his legs and arms were pinned, he fell forwards with the momentum of his run and landed face first on the cold hard slabs. The Captain turned and walked away from him, his hand still around Ayda’s throat, carrying her as if she were lighter than air. Niall felt himself being turned over and dragged unceremoniously away. Karl roughly sat him against a wall.‘There’s nothing we can do brother!’ Karl growled as he slapped him. Niall still could not move but he could see. He watched helplessly, his eyes stinging as Ayda was carried away. He had almost given up hope when… BANG. The Captain stumbled back. BANG. Pushed back again, the Captain lost his hold on Ayda, she stumbled, and crawled desperately away from him. An invisible force was battering the Captain. His shield reverberated through the air, ripples showing in the invisible barrier around him. Shock was etched onto the Captain’s face as he spun around trying to find the source of this power. A grin grew across his face. Niall’s heart sank. Elle had come for her sister. She was walking like a girl much older than her years. A confidence born of anger and hatred, her face was twisted with a dark fury. Niall nursed a deep fear of her, her eyes were black as coal and unseeing. She did not appear to notice the destruction around her as her eyes fixed on the Captain in a deadly glare. Ayda was weeping, in pain or shock no-one knew, Niall wanted to call out to her, but he still couldn’t move. Karl was stuck to his side threateningly, ready to defend his friend against anything. He watched as Elle continued to move forward pelting the Captain with strike after strike, he was no longer stumbling, he expected her. His shield held firm as her attack continued, then finally she paused, measuring her target. He made the most of her hesitation and pushed his magic into the buildings next to her, they exploded all around her. Niall heard screaming ringing in his mind. Dust choked everyone, he couldn’t see her. Ayda had not moved from her spot, she looked ready to jump in to save her sister, but what could she do? The dust settled, and Elle emerged, she had conjured a shield and saved herself from the blast, to the amusement of the Captain and the surprised relief of everyone else.‘You are learning little one.’ He cajoled. Instantly sparks shot from his outstretched hands and electrified her shield, millions of ripples resounded through the air. Elle’s small face was scrunched up as she concentrated on her shield. Niall watched as white-hot flames burst out of her hand and surrounded the Captain in a blaze. Both mages continued to batter each-other fiercely, with none making a huge impact, blow after blow was blocked, their shields stood strong.‘Someone’s got to tire first. Let’s hope it’s not Elle.’ Karl grumbled. It couldn’t be Elle, Niall reassured himself. The Captain spent so much of his power on those fearsome wolves and blowing up this town, surely after Elle managed to bring down a Castle and kill every soldier there she must be stronger! His resolve began to falter as the battle ensued. Elle stopped attacking, her little angry face was screwed up and tight as she concentrated fully on her shield. A huge blast of power from the Captain quaked her shield and she stumbled backwards a few steps. She was losing. Her magic was failing. Ayda had spotted it too, as quickly as she could, she ran towards the Captain with her sword raised, roaring in desperation. The Captain didn’t even look at her as he waved his hand and sent her flying. She fell, motionless like a doll, to the floor beside them. Niall was furious, he still could not move, he couldn’t even call out to her and Karl was point blank refusing to leave him. Someone had to help her! Elle grew weaker and weaker by the second, slowly, his heart sank as her shield flickered and she slowly backed down to her knees, tears streaming from her eyes. It all happened at once. The Captain screamed out in pain as a dagger slid its way through his throat just before everything was thrown backwards in a sudden blast of power. Ringing sounded in his ears, dust filled the air. Then silence. Complete eerie silence. Was Elle alive? What had happened to the Captain? Instantly, the feeling in his arms and legs returned, he could move again. Clumsily he got to his feet, aided by Karl, who was covered in soot and dust. He ran over to Ayda and checked her, she was breathing but unconscious. Karl, being larger and stronger picked her up.‘Elle!’ Niall roared. He couldn’t see two feet in front of him. Hands outstretched he began to wade through the dust in the direction he last saw her. Finally, the dust began to settle. Everything was covered in a thin layer of white sand, bodies and bricks alike. The moment Niall saw her he ran to her, occasionally tripping over his new legs.‘Elle you’re OK. Thank the lord you’re OK!’ He sighed deeply with relief, hardly believing it. He made to hug her. She resisted him, gazing into the distance. “Ayda’s OK, we’ve got her, we need to go.”‘She saved me.’ Elle whispered in shock. Confused, Niall followed her gaze to a young woman unmoving on the ground not far from the dead Captain. The woman’s red hair was speckled with dust and debris. Syren.‘Oh no, no, no!’ Niall exclaimed rushing over to Syren’s limp form. Her eyes were open, her breathing was slow. Pain was written all over her pale and dusty face.‘Why did you do that?’ Elle whispered, she had followed Niall to Syren’s side. Syren reached out feebly for the young Princess’s hand.‘You and Ayda are my only family.’ Syren said weakly, breath catching in her throat. With that, Elle kissed her friend on the cheek and whispered something Niall could not hear. He examined the Elf’s body, there were a few scratches and slight bruises visible, but he feared the force of the blast from Elle had caused worse internal damage. There was no way for him to tell what was draining her of life, and he could not see how long she had left. They needed help. They needed a miracle. Wounds he could help to heal, but so little was known of internal injury. He could not help but fear the worst for the young ferocious Elf who had saved their lives. He looked at Ayda, lying in Karl’s arms, and felt his heart hit the floor. How could anyone explain to her that after all she had lost, she was to now lose her dearest friend?‘What do we do?’ Karl asked quietly.‘I don’t know if she can be moved, but we can’t stay here.’ Niall responded, stroking Elle’s hair as she watched over Syren’s frail frame.‘Karl,’ Niall said, standing to look at this friend. ‘Take the Princesses and find Theo, I’m going to stay with Syren.’‘She won’t last, come with us. There’s no point you getting yourself into danger.’ Karl replied firmly.‘I’m not leaving her here alone,’ Niall snapped, ‘She deserves more than that.’ Karl stood resolute. He was not leaving Niall alone. Niall looked at Syren, he had never appreciated her, she had been frustrating and dismissive to him and his friends, but she had been steadfast in their goal. She had risked her life protecting her family, and he could not forget that. Surely, now, they could at last, put race behind them and move on? Syren’s eyes were locked on his. Her eyes once bright, alert and alarming, were now tired and red, betraying the broken body they concealed.‘Leave me,’ She whispered. ‘Keep them safe.’ Niall considered Elle. She was sat, staring at him, her face pale and sickly. Surprisingly, there were no tears. He doubted the poor girl had many tears left to shed after all she had seen and learned. He could not leave Syren, Elle and Ayda would hate him forever. He knew however, that staying here with Syren kept Ayda and Elle at risk, the Legion would come, and they would stand no chance fighting them off now. His heart felt bruised and battered that whichever path he chose, Ayda would forever hate him. He had to make the right decision for everyone.‘I can’t.’ Niall replied, ‘You’re coming with us.’Syren gave a feeble laugh and shook her head, ‘I cannot move, I am too weak.’‘We will carry you.’‘I am dying.’ Syren said matter-of-factly. Niall marvelled at her courage, to throw yourself in harm’s way for those you love and be aware of the price you will pay was admirable. He could not fail to respect her for that.‘Ayda will want to say goodbye, but here, we are all at risk.’ Niall said sadly, kneeling by her side once more. Syren nodded, understanding. He felt uncomfortable at delivering the final message but knew it would do the trick. Syren would do anything for Ayda, that much she had proven.‘Karl, find Theo, we’ll need all the help we can find.’ Niall requested. Karl finally nodded, and carrying Ayda, retreated out of the destroyed village. Elle would not leave Syren’s side, she had not let go of her friend’s hand. Niall decided to leave them alone, he wandered into the nearest wreckage to seek scraps of crates or carts for a make shift litter. He pondered his decision, it would undoubtedly be uncomfortable for Syren, but he could not leave her here alone and he could not risk the Princesses’ safety. Sighing, he collected anything useful he could find, steeling his heart against the broken bodies of villagers lying in the aftermath. Many minutes passed, and he had collected several decent sized planks of wood and lengths of rope.‘Niall!’ He heard Elle shout for him. Then he heard it, distantly he could hear the thunder of hooves pounding the ground. Someone was approaching the village. Niall dashed faster than lightning back to the square. Syren and Elle had somehow managed to shimmy Syren up against a wall, where she was now resting, Elle beside her. Niall stood before them, dropping his collection to the ground nearby, his fist firmly clenching the hilt of his sword, ready to meet the traveller. The horse was a huge, monstrously built black stallion, Niall would guess eighteen hands high, and was armoured in gold matching it’s rider. The rider was head to toe in gold, Niall felt a shiver of remembrance as he took in the stance, and the emblem adorning the golden armour. The Royal Emblem. Niall remembered seeing such armour many years ago when he bid farewell to a young and sad Princess. Niall heard Elle gasp and run to stand beside him.‘It’s Sir Rakel! My Father’s Protector!’ She whispered excitedly. Niall had to stop himself from pointing out that Sir Rakel had not done a particularly good job of protecting the King, seeing as he had been nowhere around at the time of the King’s brutal murder. The horse was approaching ever nearer.‘Stop!’ Niall called out confidently with his sword raised, pushing Elle back with the other hand.‘What are you doing?’ Elle squealed.‘I do not know I can trust him!’ Niall murmured to her, pushing her gently backwards, not lowering his sword arm.‘Peace, boy!’ The rider called out to him, slowing and stopping at a respectful distance.‘What business do you have here?’ Niall responded clearly.‘I have been tracking your party for days, I am here for their Royal Highnesses,’ Sir Rakel called.‘They are no longer here, they have left this village as you see it.’ Niall bluffed feebly.‘Do not try to insult me, for I see young Princess Brielle behind you.’ Sir Rakel laughed, as he dismounted his stallion proudly. He walked confidently closer to them, his gauntleted hands raised in front of him in surrender.‘I would recognise that young Elf anywhere.’ He said proudly, removing his helm and smiling kindly at her as he approached.‘Sir Rakel would never hurt me.’ Elle pleaded with Niall. She was the happiest he had ever seen her, he face was glowing with excitement as she watched Sir Rakel approach. Niall was at a loss, this man he knew to be the same Elf that had rescued Ayda, and he was here, a typical Knight in Shining Armour to protect Elle. But something was amiss, how had this Elf tracked them for so long to now conveniently find them when they were so much weakened. He kept his sword high.‘You are right not to trust me human,’ Sir Rakel said, ‘I know what happened at the Stone Castle, the betrayal my dear King suffered. I am not your enemy.’‘I would not trust anyone with the Princess.’ Niall spat, the niceties had vanished. Sir Rakel growled as he drew his own sword and raised it in challenge. Niall could see the Elf was much older than he, his hair was white, and skin was slightly creased. Niall had always admired the way Elves were spared the fate of time and aged much slower than humans. Despite the difference in age, Niall disliked the odds, this Elf was wiser and heavily armoured. He would not likely win this alone.‘I have known the Princess since she was a babe, and her Father was always my brother, I would ask how I can trust a human with one so precious to me!’‘Stop it!’ Elle screeched, ignoring Niall’s protests she moved between them her hands outstretched. Immediately, Sir Rakel bowed down to one knee, in a gesture of obedience Niall had never seen before. Sensing the danger had passed with Brielle’s intervention, Niall lowered his sword slightly as Elle approached him.‘I know you are trying to protect me. You must learn to trust me, as I do you. You cannot harm this Elf without harming me.’ Brielle said kindly and confidently, her eyes were blazing with emotion. This old soldier meant a lot to her, he could see. He sheathed his sword, glaring at the Golden Protector. Sir Rakel was still bowed on one knee, his sword on the ground beside him, inches from his fingertips. Niall watched carefully, his heart quickening as Elle smiled at him as she turned to approach Sir Rakel. He struggled against his own instincts, mere seconds it would take for the old Elf to grab his sword and wipe Elle from this world, he prayed he was wrong. He was too far away now to help her. Trust me, she had asked. In a world where everyone she knew was gone or betrayed, she still believed in trust. She still loved this Elf even in his failure to protect her Father. He held his breath as she bid the Protector to rise and felt relief flood his heart as he watched them embrace, as a father would embrace his child after years apart. Satisfied, he relaxed as he watched Sir Rakel lift the Princess off her feet and sweep her around in circles, both laughing with relief and happiness. Niall felt a slight sting as he remembered his own Father, he would do anything to speak with him again.‘Sir- Sir Rakel?’ A weak voice sounded, puncturing the elation of the moment.‘Syren?’ Sir Rakel’s face brightened with enthusiasm, then flickered when he recognised the weakness and pain. She was trying desperately to stand, but to no avail, her legs were barely strong enough to move.‘Oh, my dear, what has happened to you?’ Sir Rakel moved to Syren’s side, Elle following miserably behind.‘It was all my fault.’ Elle mumbled miserably, crouching down to Syren.‘What happened?’ Sir Rakel asked again.‘The Captain attacked the village looking for me, I fought him off, he had Ayda.’ Elle explained.‘With your magic?’ The Protector asked quickly, Elle nodded, shocked.‘How do you know about her magic?’ Niall demanded suspiciously. Sir Rakel sighed.‘Of course, I knew, your Father knew you had magic.’ Sir Rakel said.‘Why-why didn’t he tell me?’ Elle asked.‘You were too young, and we never really knew how powerful you would become. It was better kept a secret. As you are now aware, The Elders do not take kindly to Mages.’‘If you knew they would do this, why did you not protect her? Protect Ayda? Protect the King and Queen?’ Niall burst out furiously.‘We didn’t think it would happen so soon. I am sorry for your Father, Princess, he made me promise to hide the Queen, to get his Queen to safety.’ Sir Rakel’s voice wavered.‘My Mother is safe?’ Elle exclaimed.‘Yes,’ Sir Rakel responded. ‘I thought you would know, she sent me to you.’‘Where is she? We must go to her!’‘We cannot go, I must get you to the Temple.’‘Why?’‘Because when I was young, my best friend was sent there in secret, smuggled from the city,’ Sir Rakel began, ‘He met with a Scholar at the Temple who taught him to control his gift. If we can find this Scholar, he can help you with yours.’‘You mean my Father,’ Elle said, ‘This Scholar taught my Father to use his magic,’ Sir Rakel nodded. Syren tried to smother a whine as pain engulfed her. Sir Rakel ended the conversation, explaining that they needed to move on as quickly as possible. Together they bound Niall’s gatherings into a make-shift litter and cleverly attached wheels from an abandoned cart. Carefully lifting Syren into it, Niall admired their handiwork. The litter looked like a tiny box on wheels, complete with walls and roof, in her weakened state, they decided to make it as protected as possible. It wasn’t perfect, and her feet were dangling slightly out of it, but it would have to do. With encouragement and assistance, Elle was lifted by her Knight onto the saddle of his huge stallion, named Trojan, and she followed on as they carried Syren away from the ruins of the village. Elle looked tiny seated upon the beast, her head bobbing with each mountainous step. They moved slowly and silently, straining from the effort of pulling the litter, careful not to disturb Syren’s broken body too much.‘Ayda!’ Elle called with glee. Finally, they were together. Ayda was flying on her horse faster than anything Niall had ever seen. He hardly caught a glimpse of her as she leapt from her horse and careered towards her sister smothering her with affection. She had eyes only for her sister. Theo and Karl approached soon after. Theo was sporting a bruised face, Niall noticed as he greeted his friend.‘What happened to you?’ He asked.‘The little Princess happened. She knocked me out when I tried to restrain her.’ Theo explained quietly.‘You got beaten by a child?’ Niall laughed, ‘Pathetic.’‘She has magic!’ Theo exclaimed, abashed. Elle tore herself away from her sister and jumped into Theo, apologising for her attack on him. Niall watched as Sir Rakel once again got down on one knee as Ayda recognised him. Silence followed as a resounding SMACK echoed through the air. Ayda had smacked Sir Rakel around the face. Niall leapt in to save him.‘Where were you!’ She shrieked, her eyes flashing fire. She rounded on him again, Niall grabbed her.‘I’m sorry Princess, I had to follow my orders!’ Sir Rakel pleaded, tears brimming his eyes, he had the good sense to stay kneeled.‘Is that why you are here? To kill us like you killed him!’ She howled. The effort of restraining her was akin to keeping a predator from its prey.‘No! I never killed him! I loved your Father!’‘You left him to die! You were supposed to protect him!’‘Ayda stop! Listen to him!’ Elle said loudly and firmly. All eyes were drawn to the small Elf.‘We should kill him Elle, he cannot be trusted!’ Ayda hissed.‘Yes, you should kill me, for I have wanted nothing more since leaving my King. But let me explain!’ Sir Rakel said, defeated. Ayda was still ricocheting in Niall’s arms, it was becoming increasingly difficult to hold her. Finally, she broke free, smashing Niall in the face she floored him, and ran full pelt at Sir Rakel.‘No more,’ Elle said simply. Elle raised her hand and stopped her sister dead. Ayda could not move. Her eyes darted from Sir Rakel to Elle in horror. She was frozen mid-run like a statue.‘I’m sorry Ayda,’ Elle whispered, ‘There has been enough hate, listen to what he has to say. Please.’ Sir Rakel repeated his explanation to the newcomers. He explained the King’s knowledge of power and how he was taught in secret by a Scholar at the Temple. He explained the King’s suspicions of Brielle, their long conversations about her power. The promise he made to his beloved friend, to protect his wife, his Queen above all else. Sir Rakel confessed his battle, he wanted to protect the Princesses but was torn between his conscience and his command. Sir Rakel expressed his remorse that one part of the King’s plan had failed. The King had planned on getting the Princesses and training Brielle himself, but had underestimated the Legion. In the end he and Sir Morcei had managed to sneak the Queen out of the City with a band of loyal Protectors. She was now safely in hiding in the Pearl Mountains with her Guard, presumed buried beneath the rubble of the Castle.‘Mother would not have left without us.’ Elle said simply, releasing Ayda from her state. Ayda stood, watching Sir Rakel with a calculating look.‘No. We had to slip something in her drink that night, so she had no choice.’ Sir Rakel chuckled sadly and pointed at the ghost of a bruise that had only recently healed around his eye, ‘She gave me this when she realised what I had done.’‘As soon as she heard the Legion were still searching for you, and that you escaped the City, she sent me to find you.’ Sir Rakel finished.‘Are we going to her?’ Ayda asked, hope getting the better of her.‘No, I am to take you both North, to the Temple of Scholars, so Elle can begin her education.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘No, she isn’t.’ Ayda commanded firmly. Sir Rakel looked abashed and confused.‘Have you not heard –’ He began.‘Yes, I have heard. The Scholars work with the Elders. I would not trust the Scholars with Brielle, and I do not trust you.’ Ayda said firmly.‘Yes, the Scholars work closely with the Elders, but there is one that does not. The same one who trained your Father.’‘According to you! How do I know this is not all lies!?’ Ayda demanded. Niall could understand her mistrust. She had been shocked and deeply hurt by the betrayal of the Patrol, and by the Guards of the Castle who had turned on her family. He guessed she did not want to put her faith in this Protector, for fear that this time, the betrayal would kill her.‘I have only my word.’ Sir Rakel finished, his hand upon his heart and his head bowed. For the first time, Ayda glimpsed the litter behind them, rested on the ground. Anger flickered from her face replaced by weary curiosity.‘What is that?’ She spat, pointing.‘It’s Syren.’",

      "content": "11 – AYDAAyda’s heart hit the floor when she heard the name. Her temper and hatred for Sir Rakel dissipated as quickly as it had built. It couldn’t be. Syren had left them, chosen to abandon them. How had she been injured? Ayda looked to Elle, a vision of regret, and knew it to be true. Syren had come back?“She’d been following us Ayda,” Elle whispered. Ayda took a deep breath and slowly prepared herself for the worst as she edged to the rear of the litter. Her friend was awake, but still. Her red hair was rolling across her shoulders as her chest gently shook as she struggled to breath. A weak smile flitted across Syren’s face. Her dear friend and her equal had come back, and somehow, she had been bettered. But bettered by who?‘It was my fault.’ Elle said timidly behind her. Ayda could not feel anger. She felt a deep sorrow bubbling in her stomach. Syren had been one of the toughest fighters she had known, what had reduced her to this?‘You lost control?’ Ayda asked.‘No, but she did get hurt by the blast.’‘You killed the Captain alone?’‘Not alone, Syren helped…’ Elle mumbled.‘You should have stayed with Theo.’ Ayda said calmly, her eyes not leaving her weakened friend, who had since dozed off.‘I wasn’t leaving you.’ Elle said firmly. Ayda guessed that the others had left them alone. Given them time with Syren. Time to grieve. Ayda felt poison fill her mouth, time to grieve. All her life had been spent on grieving. She had no more energy for it. No more tears to shed and no more strength for the crushing weight. Her head was swimming with worry. She could not allow herself to hope that her Mother, the Queen, had survived. Ayda had learnt the hard way that there was little to hope for in this life. Life was full of loss, first her beloved childhood friend, then her Parents and now Syren. Elle had wrapped her small arms around the Soldier’s waist. Ayda peered down at her, tears were streaming from the little Elf’s eyes in sorrow.‘You saved us all Elle,’ Ayda soothed, ‘Shed no tears.’‘Will she live?’ Elle asked.‘We are going to save her. Together.’ Ayda said firmly. She wanted so desperately to believe it. She would encourage Brielle to believe, yet her heart would not sing the same song. Her heart had long tired of hope and pain.‘We should go to the Temple, like Sir Rakel says.’‘Why? Would you not rather see Mother?’ Ayda replied, surprised.‘Of course! But… I would only hurt her. I need to learn my magic.’ Brielle nodded sadly.Ayda knew she was right. The idea that the Scholars could help her had appeared in her mind over the last few days. Magic was rare. But it seemed to flow through the Temple from the stories and the history that the Scholars possessed. If anyone would know about magic it would be them. If there really was a Scholar prepared to help them, who had helped her Father, then it could be a turning point for them. They were treading water, not wanting to take the plunge. Their enemies were surrounding them and were more powerful, Elle was the only one who could stand against them. They had no other option.‘The Scholars have the best healing skills too, they will help Syren.’ Ayda agreed, deciding on their course.‘Will the others come?’‘Syren and Rakel definitely. But I don’t know about the others.’ Ayda replied. She spied Niall, Theo and Karl approaching, leading their horses who had bolted during the fight. Each of them looked weighed down, with a dark cloud circling their heads. It had been a turbulent time for all of them. The humans knew nothing of their history, and nothing of Magic. These men had volunteered to protect her sister but were now out of their depth. As she now felt.‘They helped us, you know.’ Elle said quietly, following Ayda’s line of sight.‘How?’ Ayda replied, her eyes not moving from Niall. He still reminded her of the boy who had saved her. He was brave, playful and kind. His innocence had gone, as had hers. They were both hardened now, anchored by responsibility.‘Karl carried you to safety. Niall refused to leave her.’‘Leave who?’‘Syren.’Ayda’s eyebrows rose. Guilt flowed through her veins. She had treated him so poorly. Ayda and Syren had not trusted them from the moment they met in that barn. Niall had proved himself over and over to them, but they still refused to let him in. Niall had saved her life over and over, but Ayda still loathed him. Syren despised humans in general, it was nothing personal. But Ayda knew it was more than that for her. She was connected to Niall by a string of memories she would rather scourge from her mind. His playful kind face, reminded her of Jonas’. The realisation that Niall had protected and carried Syren to safety, pulled the veil from her mind. She had been so very wrong.‘Where we headed then, boss?’ Niall winked at her as he approached.‘You’re coming?’ Elle squealed, running up to Theo.‘I promised we’d protect you, and even though we’re not much use right now, the jobs not done.’ Niall laughed. Ayda fought back the urge to hold him. Even now, against all the odds and all the struggles, he was steadfast. Something must have shown in Ayda’s eye because Niall’s face softened as he walked closer to her.‘How is she? The Old Knight seems to think there are healers at the Temple?’ He said softly, peering in to check Syren.‘Yes, that is where we must go.’ Ayda replied. Niall nodded in understanding.‘Thank you for saving her, and for... well everything.’ Ayda added, blushing slightly.‘You’re going soft,’ Niall replied, Ayda could see he was secretly pleased, it had taken her too long.‘Do you think Sir Rakel remembers you?’‘What? From when? Eh?’ Niall seemed shocked as he stumbled over his words.‘From across the bridge, you know when we were children.’ Ayda replied, wondering why he reacted so worriedly. Ayda grew suspicious, it wasn’t like him, was he hiding something? Had something happened between them? Had Sir Rakel gone back to the town for revenge?‘Oh, I dunno,’ Niall said, seemingly relieved, ‘You don’t trust him.’‘You think I should?’‘Since when have you cared what I thought?’ Niall laughed shyly. Ayda became very aware that they were alone with sleeping Syren. Elle had been whisked away by Karl and Theo.‘I hate him for leaving Father.’‘Yet, if he’s telling the truth, then he saved your Mother,’ Niall shrugged.‘He could have taken Elle with him.’‘Your Father was a Mage, they probably believed he was more likely to succeed in protecting your Sister,’ Niall countered. When Ayda opened her mouth to argue Niall raised his hand.‘You are wise not to readily trust but be careful not to push the few friends you have away.’‘Are we going?’ Sir Rakel appeared with the others, each had mounted a horse waiting for them. Ayda and Niall climbed onto their mounts and followed Sir Rakel north. Ayda hoped she had made the right decision, her mind seemed so clouded, and everything was out of her control. She thought on what Niall had said and knew he was right. She found herself trusting him, and his comrades, they were still with her after all, when so many of her Elven friends were now her enemies. Syren’s cart prattled behind them, lead on by Karl and Theo. She hoped it would not take long to get to the Temple, she prayed Syren would make it.Days passed without event. The snow had melted as they moved on. Fertile green lands adorned with everlasting trees and endless rolling hills made way for the smooth glass river, flowing fluently through the lips of land. They had reached the Myr River within a day and were now following it steadily north as instructed. Syren had not weakened as much as they feared, even though she spent much of her time sleeping. The sound of rushing water had soothed Ayda, the peaceful tranquillity of water had poured through her and seemingly washed many of her concerns away. Unfortunately, the river had not washed Sir Rakel away, she thought. She wanted to trust him, she really did. He had been a close companion of her Father since they were boys and like an Uncle to her and Elle. But how could she trust him after he abandoned them? To Elle, it was like he had never been missing. She still loved him and respected him. Ayda knew Elle considered him a hero after bringing Ayda home safely all those years ago, even though Elle had not been around, she had heard stories. Having never travelled this far north, the group marvelled at the river and the surroundings. Birds of the brightest blues and yellows nestled in the trees that lined the river, wild flowers towered over the grass, as though reaching for the sun. There were no paths to speak of, this part of their world was untouched and untamed. Sir Rakel explained that they were growing close to the border of the Wastes. People rarely ventured this far north, as there was nothing to visit. No villages, no business and no land for farming.‘Do many travel this way to reach the Temple?’ Theo asked once.‘No, for only very few people know the whereabouts of the Temple, only those who have access to Royal Maps. I have never seen it. Your Father told me we would find the Temple at the Source of the River.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘Did you not escort Father to the Temple when he was younger?’ Ayda asked.‘Good heavens no, he met with a Scholar who took him in, I believe him to be the last to have seen it.’‘The Temple is a library of records and knowledge,’ Ayda recalled, ‘The Elders pass down knowledge to the Scholars, who record it and study it. It is forbidden for any Scholar to share this information with anyone outside of the Temple. It is punishable by death.’‘Yes indeed.’ Sir Rakel nodded,‘So why did one of them take my Father in, if the Elders forbid magic?’‘I believe you will have to ask him that, as I will not pretend to know everything, I know my duty, that is all.’ Sir Rakel bowed his head.‘It will be heavily guarded then,’ Niall contributed, ‘How do you plan on getting us in?’‘I have been told to escort you to the Temple where we will be met by the Scholar.’ Sir Rakel blushed slightly.‘So, there is no plan. We just wait for the mystery Scholar who is breaking his most sacred rule. Sounds brilliant.’ Niall replied sarcastically, shooting an exasperated look at Ayda. Ayda was pleased to see the old Knight shift uncomfortably. This whole plan seemed foolish to her. Firstly, they were following and taking advice from a Protector who had betrayed them, trusting that his information and intentions were good. Secondly, they were waiting for an old man who had broken his oath to smuggle them in - and that was if the whole plan was not a fabrication to lure them into the hands of the Legion. Ayda saw defeat in both outcomes. Either Sir Rakel was lying and leading them to their enemy, or he was telling the truth, and the lameness of his plan lead them to their enemy. Ayda hated the whole plan. Elle, however, had complete and unwavering confidence in Sir Rakel. To her he was the Knight in her childhood story books. Ayda had promised to protect Elle, which meant following her into danger. By her side she would stay. They had grown tired and sore from riding and were now on foot, leading their horses along the meandering skirts of the river. Ayda’s leather boots were filthy, where they were once black on polished, they were now brown, but she was used to it. Trousers, armour, swords and dirt were common place when on Patrol and in the Barracks, she had called home. She felt comfortable in her tunic and ‘men’s clothes’ as Brielle and her Mother had once jibed. To her credit, Elle had not once complained about her attire. Ayda remembered the pale-pink lace dress she had last seen her little sister in. She closed her eyes and remembered the last time her family had been together. It felt so long ago. Brielle had been overjoyed with the feast, with the dancing and the dresses. She had bloomed in a carefree and childish way and revelled in the entertainment. Her Mother and Father had been flying so high and were so loved by everyone around them. Ayda felt the low sun warm her face as her emotions caught in her chest when she remembered how everyone had applauded and congratulated the family on Elle’s summons. The summons that had led to the end of life as they knew it. She caught her Father’s laughter in her mind and felt it heavy and painful but also beautiful and pure, it was too much to hold on to, she let it go. His laughter faded. Her heart was full of love for her family. She recollected her Father’s last words to her, the words she had thought so strange at the time, ‘she has every right to be scared… she will need her sister to guide her and protect her.’ Ayda realised that maybe her Father had known something was going to happen. Which meant that Sir Rakel could be telling the truth.‘Ayda, are you ok?’ Elle had appeared at her side, she had not realised she had fallen so far behind the group, Ayda had enjoyed swimming in the safe serenity of memory. Trying to retain the swelling in her heart she looked at her sister. Her strong, wonderful sister. Putting her arm around her she smiled.‘I’m fine, Elle, just remembering our Father.’ Ayda smiled.‘You don’t smile anymore,’ Elle pointed out, ‘It must be a good memory?’‘I don’t think I have any bad memories of Father,’ Ayda scrunched up her face trying to think.‘Well you’re lucky, I remember him emptying my chambers of dolls when I was small,’ Elle said cheerfully. Ayda knew she was joking, it warmed her heart. After everything, Elle was still able to encourage happiness. She was so much stronger than she appeared.‘To make room for new ones I remember!’ Ayda laughed, squeezing her treasure.‘Yes, it’s funny isn’t it?’‘What is?’‘To be so afraid that you have lost everything, to then realise you were always blessed with so much more.’ Elle said peacefully. Her little sister had grown into such a special young elf. She had always known Elle to be kind and sensitive, but she was now so much more than that. Her troubles and her pains had made Elle stronger, smarter and had opened her mind to potential. She had overcome so much that her confidence had enlightened her. Ayda saw her now, less as a child and more as a leader, a Princess who would one day make for the wisest of Queens. Theo called out to Elle and joyfully she ran to him. He had found something, it was cupped in his hand and when revealed, Elle had cried out in glee.‘She is an amazing little Elf.’ A voice said weakly. Ayda had been walking closer to the litter and realised she had heard some of the conversation with Elle.‘There was a moment when I was afraid of her.’ Ayda admitted painfully, walking up to the litter. Syren was doing well, she could not walk and was still very weak, but she was still with them and was still fighting, Ayda marvelled at her will. She hoped her friend would make the journey.‘I think we all were and still should be.’ Syren said. Ayda looked at her friend questioningly.‘She is young, and although wise and pure, she still lacks control.’ Syren explained, wincing slightly as she tried to move to a more comfortable position.‘She will master it.’ Ayda replied confidently.‘She spent a lot of time apologizing to me,’ Syren continued, ‘She felt guilty for hurting me, but she was also proud she was able to save you. She has become less afraid of herself I believe.’Ayda had noticed the change in her sister. Since the attack at the village, Elle had become more confident and was not as scared as she had been before. She had done what Ayda could not, she had grown with her trials, like ivy that spreads persistently higher, through weather and decay. Ayda could not help but feel angry with herself. She had been slightly older than Elle when she had ventured to Oaktown. The events there had changed her, crushed her, she knew that. Before that dreadful incident, she had been proud to be heir, and was excited at the prospect of being Queen. But since, all passion for leadership had died. She did not trust anyone, and worse, she no longer trusted herself. She had explained to her parents her plan to reject her claim to the throne. It had come as a shock, as they had had to, before, remind her that she was not yet Queen as she ran around barking commands as a child. Ayda had sworn to protect her loved ones and strengthen herself, so she would never fail as a friend again. No one had ever heard from her lips why she planned to give up her title, but most had guessed. Ayda had drowned in the guilt of leaving her friend behind, and even after so many years, still wallowed in it’s deep, dark waters. Reeds had wrapped around her ankles, tying her to remorse, never forgiving herself and never moving on. She couldn’t even say his name anymore and refused to remember his face. Ayda had believed this was the reason she was not worthy of the summons. She would not fail again. Growing up she had kept her circle of friends small, only ever playing with Brielle and training daily with Syren. They were all she needed, they were all she trusted. Anyone else would be shackles around her wrists, she feared love and she feared loss, after all she had endured. Regret must have greyed her face, as when Syren next spoke, it was to voice Ayda’s deepest fear.‘I think a time will come, when the world needs Elle, more than she needs us.’ Syren said quietly.‘I think that time is nearly upon us,’ Ayda nodded. She believed this deep down in her heart. Even worse, she believed that time was closer than they realised. Ayda had spent her life, mastering the art of combat so she could see of danger for her family. If her sister was to become a powerful mage, then what purpose did Ayda serve? Her whole life had been leading up to her becoming nothing, not even able to defend her family. And what of her sister? She had already exhibited signs of a great ruler. She was kind, she was smart, she inspired love and loyalty, even from humans! Ayda knew that Elle had a big part to play. Elle had magic. Ayda still had not fully grasped that magic had been dead to the world for centuries, the only known Mages were the Elders, and now suddenly, both the King and Elle had magic? Worse, the Elders had never sent the Legion Captains out to hunt a solitary Elf before. She had heard stories of the Legion supressing rebellion against their own authority, but that was rare. Something big was happening, Ayda was sure of it, and one day they would find the answers.",

Firstly, they were following and taking advice from a Protector who had betrayed them, trusting that his information and intentions were good. Secondly, they were waiting for an old man who had broken his oath to smuggle them in - and that was if the whole plan was not a fabrication to lure them into the hands of the Legion. Ayda saw defeat in both outcomes. Either Sir Rakel was lying and leading them to their enemy, or he was telling the truth, and the lameness of his plan lead them to their enemy. Ayda hated the whole plan. Elle, however, had complete and unwavering confidence in Sir Rakel. To her he was the Knight in her childhood story books. Ayda had promised to protect Elle, which meant following her into danger. By her side she would stay. They had grown tired and sore from riding and were now on foot, leading their horses along the meandering skirts of the river. Ayda’s leather boots were filthy, where they were once black on polished, they were now brown, but she was used to it. Trousers, armour, swords and dirt were common place when on Patrol and in the Barracks, she had called home. She felt comfortable in her tunic and ‘men’s clothes’ as Brielle and her Mother had once jibed. To her credit, Elle had not once complained about her attire. Ayda remembered the pale-pink lace dress she had last seen her little sister in. She closed her eyes and remembered the last time her family had been together. It felt so long ago. Brielle had been overjoyed with the feast, with the dancing and the dresses. She had bloomed in a carefree and childish way and revelled in the entertainment. Her Mother and Father had been flying so high and were so loved by everyone around them. Ayda felt the low sun warm her face as her emotions caught in her chest when she remembered how everyone had applauded and congratulated the family on Elle’s summons. The summons that had led to the end of life as they knew it. She caught her Father’s laughter in her mind and felt it heavy and painful but also beautiful and pure, it was too much to hold on to, she let it go. His laughter faded. Her heart was full of love for her family. She recollected her Father’s last words to her, the words she had thought so strange at the time, ‘she has every right to be scared… she will need her sister to guide her and protect her.’ Ayda realised that maybe her Father had known something was going to happen. Which meant that Sir Rakel could be telling the truth.‘Ayda, are you ok?’ Elle had appeared at her side, she had not realised she had fallen so far behind the group, Ayda had enjoyed swimming in the safe serenity of memory. Trying to retain the swelling in her heart she looked at her sister. Her strong, wonderful sister. Putting her arm around her she smiled.‘I’m fine, Elle, just remembering our Father.’ Ayda smiled.‘You don’t smile anymore,’ Elle pointed out, ‘It must be a good memory?’‘I don’t think I have any bad memories of Father,’ Ayda scrunched up her face trying to think.‘Well you’re lucky, I remember him emptying my chambers of dolls when I was small,’ Elle said cheerfully. Ayda knew she was joking, it warmed her heart. After everything, Elle was still able to encourage happiness. She was so much stronger than she appeared.‘To make room for new ones I remember!’ Ayda laughed, squeezing her treasure.‘Yes, it’s funny isn’t it?’‘What is?’‘To be so afraid that you have lost everything, to then realise you were always blessed with so much more.’ Elle said peacefully. Her little sister had grown into such a special young elf. She had always known Elle to be kind and sensitive, but she was now so much more than that. Her troubles and her pains had made Elle stronger, smarter and had opened her mind to potential. She had overcome so much that her confidence had enlightened her. Ayda saw her now, less as a child and more as a leader, a Princess who would one day make for the wisest of Queens. Theo called out to Elle and joyfully she ran to him. He had found something, it was cupped in his hand and when revealed, Elle had cried out in glee.‘She is an amazing little Elf.’ A voice said weakly. Ayda had been walking closer to the litter and realised she had heard some of the conversation with Elle.‘There was a moment when I was afraid of her.’ Ayda admitted painfully, walking up to the litter. Syren was doing well, she could not walk and was still very weak, but she was still with them and was still fighting, Ayda marvelled at her will. She hoped her friend would make the journey.‘I think we all were and still should be.’ Syren said. Ayda looked at her friend questioningly.‘She is young, and although wise and pure, she still lacks control.’ Syren explained, wincing slightly as she tried to move to a more comfortable position.‘She will master it.’ Ayda replied confidently.‘She spent a lot of time apologizing to me,’ Syren continued, ‘She felt guilty for hurting me, but she was also proud she was able to save you. She has become less afraid of herself I believe.’Ayda had noticed the change in her sister. Since the attack at the village, Elle had become more confident and was not as scared as she had been before. She had done what Ayda could not, she had grown with her trials, like ivy that spreads persistently higher, through weather and decay. Ayda could not help but feel angry with herself. She had been slightly older than Elle when she had ventured to Oaktown. The events there had changed her, crushed her, she knew that. Before that dreadful incident, she had been proud to be heir, and was excited at the prospect of being Queen. But since, all passion for leadership had died. She did not trust anyone, and worse, she no longer trusted herself. She had explained to her parents her plan to reject her claim to the throne. It had come as a shock, as they had had to, before, remind her that she was not yet Queen as she ran around barking commands as a child. Ayda had sworn to protect her loved ones and strengthen herself, so she would never fail as a friend again. No one had ever heard from her lips why she planned to give up her title, but most had guessed. Ayda had drowned in the guilt of leaving her friend behind, and even after so many years, still wallowed in it’s deep, dark waters. Reeds had wrapped around her ankles, tying her to remorse, never forgiving herself and never moving on. She couldn’t even say his name anymore and refused to remember his face. Ayda had believed this was the reason she was not worthy of the summons. She would not fail again. Growing up she had kept her circle of friends small, only ever playing with Brielle and training daily with Syren. They were all she needed, they were all she trusted. Anyone else would be shackles around her wrists, she feared love and she feared loss, after all she had endured. Regret must have greyed her face, as when Syren next spoke, it was to voice Ayda’s deepest fear.‘I think a time will come, when the world needs Elle, more than she needs us.’ Syren said quietly.‘I think that time is nearly upon us,’ Ayda nodded. She believed this deep down in her heart. Even worse, she believed that time was closer than they realised. Ayda had spent her life, mastering the art of combat so she could see of danger for her family. If her sister was to become a powerful mage, then what purpose did Ayda serve? Her whole life had been leading up to her becoming nothing, not even able to defend her family. And what of her sister? She had already exhibited signs of a great ruler. She was kind, she was smart, she inspired love and loyalty, even from humans! Ayda knew that Elle had a big part to play. Elle had magic. Ayda still had not fully grasped that magic had been dead to the world for centuries, the only known Mages were the Elders, and now suddenly, both the King and Elle had magic? Worse, the Elders had never sent the Legion Captains out to hunt a solitary Elf before. She had heard stories of the Legion supressing rebellion against their own authority, but that was rare. Something big was happening, Ayda was sure of it, and one day they would find the answers.",

      "content": "12 – ELLEIt was a relief to see Ayda smile again. Ayda had not been happy for as long as Elle could remember, she was always busying herself at the Barracks and never cared much for socialising, but she had never seen her so clouded. It had been a fine moment when Elle had noticed her sister and Niall progress, it seemed that Ayda had let go of whatever it was that had barricaded her into solitude. Elle knew there was more to that story. Ayda and Niall seemed so different around each other. Niall was usually cocky and playful when with her, Theo and Karl, yet with Ayda he was careful and nervous. Ayda also seemed more on edge and more prone to outbursts around him. She wondered on their story. Theo had made several comments over the course of the journey, about a potential history or deeper meaning and she was desperate to know more. What was it between them? She doubted it was love. Ayda simply could not bear to look at him before, she seemed to loathe him. She had been trying more recently though, Elle had guessed that might be because of what he had done for her and Syren. She was happy to see it, Ayda was certainly more approachable now. Elle was proud of her sister. Ayda had ran to her aid during the attack knowing full well that she stood no chance against a Captain of the Legion. The way Ayda was handling Syren’s injuries was encouraging too, her sister simply refused to believe Syren would leave her, and Syren seemed much stronger because of it. Syren. Her biggest regret. Wracked with guilt at the injuries her magic had caused, Elle had apologised repeatedly. Syren had instantly forgiven her and soothed her, explaining that it was necessary for the good of the team. How she wished she had shouted out to Syren not to strike him. But she couldn’t, if she had the Captain might have guessed her plan, and she was almost out of magic, so she couldn’t take the risk. The Princesses would never forget Syren’s sacrifice. She remembered the boy arriving to tell them of the attack on the village, and Brielle had wasted no time fighting Theo off, who had tried to stand in her way. She was never going to leave her sister to die. Surprising herself, she had arrived at the village, furious, but focussed. Her mind had been angry but clear, she was there to defend Ayda. Feeling strength in the knowledge that she could control magic, she felt more stable, and happier to be around her friends. She was less of a burden to them now, she thought. How much life had changed! Seeing Sir Rakel arrive on Trojan his huge black stallion had reignited a raging inferno through her blood. She had thought her family lost, but with his arrival she suddenly had her Knight in shining armour and her Mother returned to her. All was not lost! There was hope! The others did not trust him, she knew, she understood. But she did not let that dampen her elation, she had so few friends, but she cherished each of them and delighted in an ally returning to her. Sir Rakel had answered all her prayers, Mother was alive, Syren would be healed and she would learn how to be a Mage. How could she not trust him after he brought them such marvellous hope! She felt buoyed by the change in situation, she felt stronger, more powerful. She was a swan gliding over the beautiful hilltops, sun in the sky, and soon she would be flying home. It was bliss. Hope was the magic her soul had been starved of.‘How much longer?’ She asked the old Knight excitedly.‘I’m not sure Princess,’ Sir Rakel responded gently, ‘It is beginning to grow dark, we should stop soon.’ Elle was impatient to reach the Temple, she did not want to rest, she wanted to keep walking. The prospect of learning to control her magic enthused her. Then she would be able to return to her Mother with Ayda and protect them. It was all she desired. Sir Rakel was excellent company, Brielle found. He would tell her wonderful stories of his past, from when he was a child playing in the Castle with the young Prince, or when he was on an adventure with his comrades. He was wise, experienced and a legendary swordsman, which was how he became her Father’s Chief Protector. Elle often caught the suspicious glances thrown at him from her troop, whilst they pricked at her they could not puncture her joy. Let them distrust him, she thought, he would prove to be true. She knew it. Eventually they stopped, the team began to ready camp. Theo disappeared again, most likely to hunt which he seemed to excel at. Ayda set about the task of preparing Elle with somewhere comfy to sleep as she always did. Karl was readying a fire whilst Niall and Rakel aided Syren out of the litter and placed her gently next to the new born fire, wrapping her up in spare blankets. Elle believed Syren grew stronger every day, but the exchanges between her friends were never positive. Syren had not stood, or done much on her own since the accident, she had explained the night before that she could move her limbs, but it just pained her to do so, she could manage to slowly feed herself and drink, so that was a relief. Elle got the impression that Syren had put a middle finger up to death for now, and was clinging on with everything she had, digging her nails in to life. She hoped there wasn’t too much pain and prayed that the Scholar could fix her. When everyone was finished, they settled down, Theo returned with a fresh kill and began roasting it on the fire. Elle began to beg Sir Rakel for another story. She always enjoyed his stories. Tonight, he had promised her the story she had been waiting for. The story that gave rise to the Elders and destroyed Elven lands, known as the Wastes. Sir Rakel cleared his throat and began;“Centuries ago, Mages were at the height of power. Humans and Elves alike had an abundance of trained and skilled Mages. Both the Human and Elven Kings were impressive in their ability. Lords and ladies of both courts were awarded with wealth and titles dependent on their strength, as both Kings sought the strongest of allies. Tensions over land and wealth between humans and elves had always been high, many battles were fought with many deaths. The population possessing no magic were hit hardest, even though they outnumbered Mages greatly, they had no strength to stop them. Too often, normal people were attacked by opposing Mages in a brutal display of power designed to intimidate and threaten. The blood shed knew no bounds. Magic was used horrendously, to destroy rather than create. One day, the much-loved Princess Akaela of Elves disappeared mysteriously, and the Elven Mages were recalled by the King for a day of respectful Mourning and a ceasefire was agreed, leaving the outskirts of Myrliar unprotected. The Human King destroyed all towns outside of the Stone City, which sparked the fierce announcement of the Last War. The Elven King declared that all humans, Mage or not, would be burned from his Earth. Originally, only children of Mages or of Royalty were tested for magic at a young age, but with the prospect of war looming, all children were tested. Children of all ages with magic, were ripped from their screaming and crying mothers, and thrown into the roughest training. There was not a drop of magical blood unclaimed. Their numbers were evenly matched. After several months of brutal training and preparation, the Kings were done waiting. Blinded by his grief for his daughter, the Elven King commanded his Army to meet the opposition, thus the war began on his own land. His villages were mowed like grass, his farms and crops burned to ruin, and his people’s blood fed the cracked land of the North. Demoralised by all that they had lost, his Mages suffered, their focus was on the wreckage, on the loss of their own lands and people and the fruitlessness of war. Thousands of Mages died that day on both sides. By nightfall, only a handful of the strongest remained. An explosion of power ripped through the land, propelled by the remainder of the Human Mages who had combined the last of their magic in a desperate attack. The war was ended by four Elven Mages, who skilfully contained the blast and refocussed the power on the enemy. It was a feat of magic that had never been seen before, and even more impressive, they each still possessed more magic than an average Mage. The Elves had won at a devastating cost. The land for miles around had been scorched of all life, even the rubble and the ruins had turned to dust. What happened after, saw the rise of the Elders as we know them. The Humans continued as before, with magic obliterated from their race, the only Mage left was their King who had lost the love of his nation. The Elven King at first, remained protected by his four surviving Mages. The Four as they became widely known, used their magic to rebuild Myrliar and begin its slow recovery. Over time, the love for The Four surpassed the love of the King, and he was removed and imprisoned for crimes against his people. The Four were anointed as the chosen Leaders of the Elves. With their dominant power they reached gracious terms with the Human King, and the River Myr was set as a boundary between their two peoples. The Four reigned in peace, no more wars, no more battles. The Elves regained their strength, their villages were rebuilt, and their farms regrew. Magic, however, had disappeared entirely. Eventually when the King of Humans passed, the Four remained the only Mages left. Many believed magic to be a gift from the Earth, and when the Earth was devastated, the gift was revoked. The Four eventually secluded themselves more and more from their prosperity, believing their task complete and their country safe, and traced the old royal bloodline back to a young boy, and trained him to take back his throne. They became his most trusted advisors. One day when his heir was born, and the Elven population’s love was secured for their new King, The Four retired into their studies, and advised from a distance. Centuries later they are now known as The Elders and are still the biggest influence and the most powerful mages in the world. Magic has been extinct on both sides since the war, centuries ago… until your Father, and now you.” Sir Rakel added with pride.Silence followed his story, a story Elle, Ayda and Syren had been told different variations, but with the same basis. The Elders had saved them all, every Elf child in Myrliar was brought up on this story, the love and respect for the Elders was still the lifeblood of the Elven people, therefore so many had betrayed her family. When choosing between their Saviours and their King, they would choose the most powerful out of fear, or respect. Ayda’s face was scrunched up concentrating on the finer details of the story they were well versed in.‘We have always been told that the Elders have been our Saviours, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore,’ Elle shook her head sadly.‘They have a no tolerance approach when it comes to magic it seems.’ Theo said.‘But why? Surely if magic has been extinct for so long they would welcome its return?’ Elle asked.‘Unless they fear it,’ Syren added weakly, ‘Maybe they don’t believe in peace whilst magic exists?’‘I believe that is their fear.’ Sir Rakel responded.‘If magic has not existed for centuries, that doesn’t explain why their Captains all seem well skilled in magic.’ Ayda said quickly. It hit Elle like a stone. Of course, she had been so bogged down in the belief that her and her Father were the only Mages since the War, but they couldn’t possibly be, otherwise how did the Captains possess magic – and of course the mystery girl from the Ritual?‘Maybe there have been mages, and they have all been hunted down?’ Niall said slowly.‘No, I don’t think that’s possible.’ Sir Rakel dismissed.‘Why?’ Ayda asked, quickly.‘Because they couldn’t possibly keep that secret. People would soon start to turn on them if their loved ones were being murdered or going missing. They haven’t kept their hunt for Elle particularly quiet.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘He has a point,’ Syren piped up, ‘No-one has ever heard of magic being used, magic is dead to the population. If people were suddenly using magic and then disappearing, rumours would most certainly have spread.’‘And if Elven mages have been hunted down, that doesn’t explain the lack of magic in Humans,’ Karl added, after a thoughtful moment.‘Yes, we have never heard of magic before, and this story is completely new to us, as if it never happened. If Elf Mages are still around but being hunted, why does magic still not exist to humans?’ Theo contributed.‘Magic is still mostly dead, then.’ Ayda finished, seemingly agreeing with their hypothesis.‘I believe so,’ Sir Rakel said, ‘I can’t explain the Captains, but I have never ever heard word or seen magic in anyone other than the King and Princess Brielle.’‘As Chief Protector and Head of the Army, and closest friend to the King, you would have, I think.’ Ayda agreed, her tone was icy as she said the last part. No one failed to notice. Elle was convinced. Magic was still rare. Humans had never heard of it, and there were no rumours or mention of it anywhere other than history books.‘I can’t believe we have no knowledge of magic at home.’ Theo said sadly in disbelief.‘I can understand why you hate our race,’ Niall shook his head miserably, ‘Our King was scum. They arranged a ceasefire and he took advantage of it. He killed so many innocents.’‘Neither side was innocent.’Shock materialised on every single face around the fire. Open mouths and wide eyes greeted the speaker. Syren had finally accepted the truth. There was no innocent party in war. When war is declared, all combatants accepted the knowledge that innocent blood would be shed. Lives lost was the currency of war. Lives lost was the reason, no one ever really won a war. Syren had finally realised that Elves were not innocent, and that both shared responsibility, and most importantly, that the three humans before her, the three humans that helped her, were not defined by their race, they were themselves.‘Well now you have to live, because I’m starting to like you.’ Theo laughed, patting her on the shoulder playfully.‘We were wrong to steal from your people,’ Niall said remorsefully.‘Why did you join the Fiends?’ Ayda asked critically.‘After I lost my Pa, the Fiends took me in,’ Niall revealed sadly, ‘They were my family, the Fiends only steal to help those who needed it.’‘Mostly.’ Karl added under his breath, with a wink from Theo.‘Why did you join the Army?’ Niall asked gently, his eyes locking with Ayda’s. Her mouth opened, and closed, Elle thought she would answer, but Ayda decided against it, she busied herself sharpening her blade and separated herself from the conversation. This piqued Elle’s curiosity. Ayda had never given a proper answer when someone asked that question, her simple answer was ‘for the people I love’ but Elle thought there was more to it than that. Tonight, her suspicions were confirmed, there was more to it than that, and Niall had nearly got it out of her. That night, the merriment was undeniable in the camp, Elle was happier that she had been in a while. A sense of peace had settled like a comfortable sheet upon them. The group had grown to respect each other, finally, after the near miss at the town, they were able to see past the differences in race and could move on together, stronger than before. Hope was bright between them too. For the first time, each of them was thinking of home, and soon talk turned to what they were looking forward to, rather than the fears they were sure to face.The next morning, they rose early, keen to get a head start on the day. Elle sat peacefully by the river whilst her friends packed up camp ready to leave. Watching the flow of water spiral and twirl energetically downstream, Elle decided to use the moment for practice. She remembered fearing magic. Remembered watching her Father fight to the death with the Captain. Remembered turning wolves into ash. Remembered accidentally boiling the lake and harming Syren. But now she had hope. She had saved Ayda. She had saved her friends by using magic. She could not fear that power now, knowing that the power she held, if mastered, could protect all those she loved from dying. Wondering what she should practice doing, Elle considered the world around her. The sun was rising slowly, casting tremendous shadows across the ground as the sun framed the landscape. Birds were singing their beautiful morning song, and the soft trickle of water soothed her senses. She felt at peace. Were there limits to her power? Where should she begin? Deciding she should start off with something useful, something less dangerous, Elle focussed on a small, broken twig on the ground next to her. She willed it to move. No response. She pictured in her mind the twig rolling further from her and attempted to push the vision towards it. No response. Elle frowned. How had she managed to fight off a trained Mage if she couldn’t even move a twig?!‘Are you OK?’ A hard voice whispered behind her. Sir Rakel had come to get her. Brielle nodded in frustration. Sir Rakel sighed and crouched down beside her.‘You were practicing?’‘How’d you guess?’ Elle replied.‘This twig isn’t interesting enough to be glared at for as long as you were.’ Sir Rakel laughed softly, twirling it between his fingers.‘What were you trying to do?’ He continued.‘Move it,’ Elle whispered sadly, ‘But I couldn’t.’ Sir Rakel nodded, seeming to understand.‘Being a Mage isn’t easy,’ He advised, ‘I remember the first time I suspected your Father had magic.’‘How’d you know?’‘We were practicing archery, your Father was a bit of a sore loser, when his arrows failed to hit the mark next to mine, he accidentally lit it and sent it soaring through an open window in frustration.’ Sir Rakel chuckled at the memory.‘Did he master it quickly?’ Elle asked, lightened by her Father’s failures in the face of her own.‘No, I think he struggled with it. He mentioned several times about feeling the flow of magic. Maybe you should concentrate on that?’ Sir Rakel suggested. Elle scrunched her face up in annoyance. She couldn’t feel magic now. She had only felt the flow of magic when it consumed her and exploded from her hands. Her hands! Raising a hand, she stretched out to the twig in Sir Rakel’s hand willing it to fly, it zoomed from his hand and into hers easily. Sir Rakel applauded happily. Elle was astounded. Was it really that easy?‘Did you understand that?’ Sir Rakel prompted. Elle shook her head. Apart from raising her hand, she didn’t understand what had been different. Sir Rakel invited her to try again. This time she paid closer attention to the magic. She had a split-second view. She noticed as she made her decision, the smallest specks of white light had flowed from her hand and disappeared into the air. It excited her. She wondered if that was it, if that was her magic.‘Can you see that?’ Elle asked eagerly, she explained the white light to Sir Rakel, who shook his head. Elle tried a few more times, each time the flow of light specks was the same. She became used to seeing them and decided to keep an eye on them when using magic in the future. Eventually the other’s joined them impatient to move on. Each of them was excited when they heard that Elle had gotten the confidence to practice. Following the river north, they grew closer and closer to the outskirts of the wastes.‘So, these flecks of light,’ Niall asked, when the party had started walking, ‘Have you not noticed them before?’‘I think I have seen them before, during the Ritual.’ Elle explained.‘You think?’‘Well, there were more of them, and much stronger lights, they almost blinded me. These ones are quite difficult to see.’‘But Sir Rakel couldn’t see them?’ Niall asked. Elle shook her head.‘Maybe only Mages can see them?’ Theo asked. Elle remembered asking her Father what the lights were. He couldn’t see them either. She explained this to her friends. They were baffled. Elle was sure it had something to do with her magic, but if her Father was a skilled Mage, why could he not see them?",

Karl was readying a fire whilst Niall and Rakel aided Syren out of the litter and placed her gently next to the new born fire, wrapping her up in spare blankets. Elle believed Syren grew stronger every day, but the exchanges between her friends were never positive. Syren had not stood, or done much on her own since the accident, she had explained the night before that she could move her limbs, but it just pained her to do so, she could manage to slowly feed herself and drink, so that was a relief. Elle got the impression that Syren had put a middle finger up to death for now, and was clinging on with everything she had, digging her nails in to life. She hoped there wasn’t too much pain and prayed that the Scholar could fix her. When everyone was finished, they settled down, Theo returned with a fresh kill and began roasting it on the fire. Elle began to beg Sir Rakel for another story. She always enjoyed his stories. Tonight, he had promised her the story she had been waiting for. The story that gave rise to the Elders and destroyed Elven lands, known as the Wastes. Sir Rakel cleared his throat and began;“Centuries ago, Mages were at the height of power. Humans and Elves alike had an abundance of trained and skilled Mages. Both the Human and Elven Kings were impressive in their ability. Lords and ladies of both courts were awarded with wealth and titles dependent on their strength, as both Kings sought the strongest of allies. Tensions over land and wealth between humans and elves had always been high, many battles were fought with many deaths. The population possessing no magic were hit hardest, even though they outnumbered Mages greatly, they had no strength to stop them. Too often, normal people were attacked by opposing Mages in a brutal display of power designed to intimidate and threaten. The blood shed knew no bounds. Magic was used horrendously, to destroy rather than create. One day, the much-loved Princess Akaela of Elves disappeared mysteriously, and the Elven Mages were recalled by the King for a day of respectful Mourning and a ceasefire was agreed, leaving the outskirts of Myrliar unprotected. The Human King destroyed all towns outside of the Stone City, which sparked the fierce announcement of the Last War. The Elven King declared that all humans, Mage or not, would be burned from his Earth. Originally, only children of Mages or of Royalty were tested for magic at a young age, but with the prospect of war looming, all children were tested. Children of all ages with magic, were ripped from their screaming and crying mothers, and thrown into the roughest training. There was not a drop of magical blood unclaimed. Their numbers were evenly matched. After several months of brutal training and preparation, the Kings were done waiting. Blinded by his grief for his daughter, the Elven King commanded his Army to meet the opposition, thus the war began on his own land. His villages were mowed like grass, his farms and crops burned to ruin, and his people’s blood fed the cracked land of the North. Demoralised by all that they had lost, his Mages suffered, their focus was on the wreckage, on the loss of their own lands and people and the fruitlessness of war. Thousands of Mages died that day on both sides. By nightfall, only a handful of the strongest remained. An explosion of power ripped through the land, propelled by the remainder of the Human Mages who had combined the last of their magic in a desperate attack. The war was ended by four Elven Mages, who skilfully contained the blast and refocussed the power on the enemy. It was a feat of magic that had never been seen before, and even more impressive, they each still possessed more magic than an average Mage. The Elves had won at a devastating cost. The land for miles around had been scorched of all life, even the rubble and the ruins had turned to dust. What happened after, saw the rise of the Elders as we know them. The Humans continued as before, with magic obliterated from their race, the only Mage left was their King who had lost the love of his nation. The Elven King at first, remained protected by his four surviving Mages. The Four as they became widely known, used their magic to rebuild Myrliar and begin its slow recovery. Over time, the love for The Four surpassed the love of the King, and he was removed and imprisoned for crimes against his people. The Four were anointed as the chosen Leaders of the Elves. With their dominant power they reached gracious terms with the Human King, and the River Myr was set as a boundary between their two peoples. The Four reigned in peace, no more wars, no more battles. The Elves regained their strength, their villages were rebuilt, and their farms regrew. Magic, however, had disappeared entirely. Eventually when the King of Humans passed, the Four remained the only Mages left. Many believed magic to be a gift from the Earth, and when the Earth was devastated, the gift was revoked. The Four eventually secluded themselves more and more from their prosperity, believing their task complete and their country safe, and traced the old royal bloodline back to a young boy, and trained him to take back his throne. They became his most trusted advisors. One day when his heir was born, and the Elven population’s love was secured for their new King, The Four retired into their studies, and advised from a distance. Centuries later they are now known as The Elders and are still the biggest influence and the most powerful mages in the world. Magic has been extinct on both sides since the war, centuries ago… until your Father, and now you.” Sir Rakel added with pride.Silence followed his story, a story Elle, Ayda and Syren had been told different variations, but with the same basis. The Elders had saved them all, every Elf child in Myrliar was brought up on this story, the love and respect for the Elders was still the lifeblood of the Elven people, therefore so many had betrayed her family. When choosing between their Saviours and their King, they would choose the most powerful out of fear, or respect. Ayda’s face was scrunched up concentrating on the finer details of the story they were well versed in.‘We have always been told that the Elders have been our Saviours, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore,’ Elle shook her head sadly.‘They have a no tolerance approach when it comes to magic it seems.’ Theo said.‘But why? Surely if magic has been extinct for so long they would welcome its return?’ Elle asked.‘Unless they fear it,’ Syren added weakly, ‘Maybe they don’t believe in peace whilst magic exists?’‘I believe that is their fear.’ Sir Rakel responded.‘If magic has not existed for centuries, that doesn’t explain why their Captains all seem well skilled in magic.’ Ayda said quickly. It hit Elle like a stone. Of course, she had been so bogged down in the belief that her and her Father were the only Mages since the War, but they couldn’t possibly be, otherwise how did the Captains possess magic – and of course the mystery girl from the Ritual?‘Maybe there have been mages, and they have all been hunted down?’ Niall said slowly.‘No, I don’t think that’s possible.’ Sir Rakel dismissed.‘Why?’ Ayda asked, quickly.‘Because they couldn’t possibly keep that secret. People would soon start to turn on them if their loved ones were being murdered or going missing. They haven’t kept their hunt for Elle particularly quiet.’ Sir Rakel explained.‘He has a point,’ Syren piped up, ‘No-one has ever heard of magic being used, magic is dead to the population. If people were suddenly using magic and then disappearing, rumours would most certainly have spread.’‘And if Elven mages have been hunted down, that doesn’t explain the lack of magic in Humans,’ Karl added, after a thoughtful moment.‘Yes, we have never heard of magic before, and this story is completely new to us, as if it never happened. If Elf Mages are still around but being hunted, why does magic still not exist to humans?’ Theo contributed.‘Magic is still mostly dead, then.’ Ayda finished, seemingly agreeing with their hypothesis.‘I believe so,’ Sir Rakel said, ‘I can’t explain the Captains, but I have never ever heard word or seen magic in anyone other than the King and Princess Brielle.’‘As Chief Protector and Head of the Army, and closest friend to the King, you would have, I think.’ Ayda agreed, her tone was icy as she said the last part. No one failed to notice. Elle was convinced. Magic was still rare. Humans had never heard of it, and there were no rumours or mention of it anywhere other than history books.‘I can’t believe we have no knowledge of magic at home.’ Theo said sadly in disbelief.‘I can understand why you hate our race,’ Niall shook his head miserably, ‘Our King was scum. They arranged a ceasefire and he took advantage of it. He killed so many innocents.’‘Neither side was innocent.’Shock materialised on every single face around the fire. Open mouths and wide eyes greeted the speaker. Syren had finally accepted the truth. There was no innocent party in war. When war is declared, all combatants accepted the knowledge that innocent blood would be shed. Lives lost was the currency of war. Lives lost was the reason, no one ever really won a war. Syren had finally realised that Elves were not innocent, and that both shared responsibility, and most importantly, that the three humans before her, the three humans that helped her, were not defined by their race, they were themselves.‘Well now you have to live, because I’m starting to like you.’ Theo laughed, patting her on the shoulder playfully.‘We were wrong to steal from your people,’ Niall said remorsefully.‘Why did you join the Fiends?’ Ayda asked critically.‘After I lost my Pa, the Fiends took me in,’ Niall revealed sadly, ‘They were my family, the Fiends only steal to help those who needed it.’‘Mostly.’ Karl added under his breath, with a wink from Theo.‘Why did you join the Army?’ Niall asked gently, his eyes locking with Ayda’s. Her mouth opened, and closed, Elle thought she would answer, but Ayda decided against it, she busied herself sharpening her blade and separated herself from the conversation. This piqued Elle’s curiosity. Ayda had never given a proper answer when someone asked that question, her simple answer was ‘for the people I love’ but Elle thought there was more to it than that. Tonight, her suspicions were confirmed, there was more to it than that, and Niall had nearly got it out of her. That night, the merriment was undeniable in the camp, Elle was happier that she had been in a while. A sense of peace had settled like a comfortable sheet upon them. The group had grown to respect each other, finally, after the near miss at the town, they were able to see past the differences in race and could move on together, stronger than before. Hope was bright between them too. For the first time, each of them was thinking of home, and soon talk turned to what they were looking forward to, rather than the fears they were sure to face.The next morning, they rose early, keen to get a head start on the day. Elle sat peacefully by the river whilst her friends packed up camp ready to leave. Watching the flow of water spiral and twirl energetically downstream, Elle decided to use the moment for practice. She remembered fearing magic. Remembered watching her Father fight to the death with the Captain. Remembered turning wolves into ash. Remembered accidentally boiling the lake and harming Syren. But now she had hope. She had saved Ayda. She had saved her friends by using magic. She could not fear that power now, knowing that the power she held, if mastered, could protect all those she loved from dying. Wondering what she should practice doing, Elle considered the world around her. The sun was rising slowly, casting tremendous shadows across the ground as the sun framed the landscape. Birds were singing their beautiful morning song, and the soft trickle of water soothed her senses. She felt at peace. Were there limits to her power? Where should she begin? Deciding she should start off with something useful, something less dangerous, Elle focussed on a small, broken twig on the ground next to her. She willed it to move. No response. She pictured in her mind the twig rolling further from her and attempted to push the vision towards it. No response. Elle frowned. How had she managed to fight off a trained Mage if she couldn’t even move a twig?!‘Are you OK?’ A hard voice whispered behind her. Sir Rakel had come to get her. Brielle nodded in frustration. Sir Rakel sighed and crouched down beside her.‘You were practicing?’‘How’d you guess?’ Elle replied.‘This twig isn’t interesting enough to be glared at for as long as you were.’ Sir Rakel laughed softly, twirling it between his fingers.‘What were you trying to do?’ He continued.‘Move it,’ Elle whispered sadly, ‘But I couldn’t.’ Sir Rakel nodded, seeming to understand.‘Being a Mage isn’t easy,’ He advised, ‘I remember the first time I suspected your Father had magic.’‘How’d you know?’‘We were practicing archery, your Father was a bit of a sore loser, when his arrows failed to hit the mark next to mine, he accidentally lit it and sent it soaring through an open window in frustration.’ Sir Rakel chuckled at the memory.‘Did he master it quickly?’ Elle asked, lightened by her Father’s failures in the face of her own.‘No, I think he struggled with it. He mentioned several times about feeling the flow of magic. Maybe you should concentrate on that?’ Sir Rakel suggested. Elle scrunched her face up in annoyance. She couldn’t feel magic now. She had only felt the flow of magic when it consumed her and exploded from her hands. Her hands! Raising a hand, she stretched out to the twig in Sir Rakel’s hand willing it to fly, it zoomed from his hand and into hers easily. Sir Rakel applauded happily. Elle was astounded. Was it really that easy?‘Did you understand that?’ Sir Rakel prompted. Elle shook her head. Apart from raising her hand, she didn’t understand what had been different. Sir Rakel invited her to try again. This time she paid closer attention to the magic. She had a split-second view. She noticed as she made her decision, the smallest specks of white light had flowed from her hand and disappeared into the air. It excited her. She wondered if that was it, if that was her magic.‘Can you see that?’ Elle asked eagerly, she explained the white light to Sir Rakel, who shook his head. Elle tried a few more times, each time the flow of light specks was the same. She became used to seeing them and decided to keep an eye on them when using magic in the future. Eventually the other’s joined them impatient to move on. Each of them was excited when they heard that Elle had gotten the confidence to practice. Following the river north, they grew closer and closer to the outskirts of the wastes.‘So, these flecks of light,’ Niall asked, when the party had started walking, ‘Have you not noticed them before?’‘I think I have seen them before, during the Ritual.’ Elle explained.‘You think?’‘Well, there were more of them, and much stronger lights, they almost blinded me. These ones are quite difficult to see.’‘But Sir Rakel couldn’t see them?’ Niall asked. Elle shook her head.‘Maybe only Mages can see them?’ Theo asked. Elle remembered asking her Father what the lights were. He couldn’t see them either. She explained this to her friends. They were baffled. Elle was sure it had something to do with her magic, but if her Father was a skilled Mage, why could he not see them?",

      "content": "13 – NIALLDays passed, and the group continued north, following the path of the river. Sir Rakel had instructed that they were to find the source of the River, but even he didn’t seem to know what to expect. The journey had been a roller coaster for Niall and his fellow Fiends. He looked back to the wet and stormy night and wondered how on earth they had become so entwined in the fate of this young elf. He should have turned back with the rest of the clan! Niall sighed deeply. Looking back at the young face of the blonde-haired elf trailing behind him, and the determined grit in the eye of her older sister, he knew there was no where he’d rather be. The journey had changed everything. He had realised how different, and yet how very similar humans and elves were. They shared a story, a past, a fate, but the humans knew nothing of it. He had had no idea of the scale of the bloodshed between the two peoples, no idea that the deep hatred shared by all was born of a centuries old war. Then there was magic! Stories of magic were unheard of throughout humanity. There was rumour and speculation that the King’s Spirit God was magically blessed, but the majority believed this to be a ludicrous tale. Could it be true? Could magic return to humans the way it had returned to the Elves? Niall had felt himself change, he was unsure. Everything to him had been so clear before, but now the water was muddied. Ayda had been so strong and fierce when she had stumbled into his childhood, and she had remained alive in his thoughts. Being with her again, as if by fate, had changed him. He was no longer care free and playful, but worried and protective. He would find himself glimpsing at her, and his heart threatened to jump from his chest whenever she smiled. There was only one person who could make her smile. The Princess was a marvel, Niall thought, throughout all she had been through, she was tough. The quiet, timid Elf that had crawled afraid from the wreckage of her home, had emerged like a soldier, passionate and ferocious. He enjoyed watching her practise her magic. He laughed at her when she pouted in frustration and swelled with pride when she failed but persevered, until she won.‘It can’t be much longer now?’ Ayda suggested, striding up to walk alongside him. Ayda had been much kinder to him of late. Since he had stood by Syren he noticed. He supposed he would be the same, had someone done that for one of his brothers. He looked at the back of their heads fondly. What would he do without them? Karl and Theo were ever the same, they were the foundation of his home. He watched them lead the group onwards, Karl ever silent, patiently listening to whatever rubbish Theo was telling him this time. He knew Karl longed for home, but loyalty kept him by Niall’s side.‘I hope not, everyday seems to leave us with more questions.’ Niall replied. He saw Ayda glimpse at him from the corner of her eye. The frustration drove them on, every truth seemed to multiply into more questions. Questions whirled through his head in a never-ending list, he could not imagine how Elle must feel, as most of the answers reflected her destiny.‘You… never told me,’ Ayda whispered hesitantly, ‘How you knew about the tunnel back at home?’ Niall recoiled. He wasn’t ready to tell her that, he wasn’t sure he would ever be. Was it worth adding to the confusion that weighed on everyone like an anchor as they trudged through the marsh? Everything was complicated enough, he didn’t need to contribute any more to that. He refused to answer believing it to be for the best. He caught Theo regarding him sadly from the distance. Niall could not accept it yet, he had hidden those feelings, drowned them over the years, it was not the right time. It was never the right time.‘You never told Princess Brielle what happened?’ Niall asked Ayda. It was her turn to wince.‘I have never spoken of it, Rakel knows of course, as did my Mother and Father, but not Elle.’‘Why?’‘My job is to protect her, I failed him, I will never fail her.’ Ayda replied simply, the cold memory gleaming like ice in her eyes.‘You did not fail him. There was nothing you could do, we were children. You need to forgive yourself.’ Niall replied. Ayda sighed.‘He only went to Oakwood Town to protect me, he tried everything to stop me going, if I’d have listened…’‘Then I wouldn’t be here to help you now.’ Niall interrupted. Their eyes connected, the piercing blue of her eyes shone brightly as before. Niall felt his heart thump against his ribcage. It was true, he thought, if he had not met her all those years ago, she would have killed him at the barn, and he would never have protected her. As it was, now, he would do almost anything for her, but he couldn’t let her know, there was too much at stake.‘After all I’ve put you through, it’s a wonder you have stuck around.’ Ayda smiled sadly.‘I vowed to protect your sister, and I feel as though there is more for me to learn about my people’s magic.’ Niall replied with a protected half-truth. Ayda nodded understandingly, muttering something about Syren she disappeared behind him to check her friend. Syren was laid lifelessly in the litter led by Sir Rakel. There was a time, when they had all believed she had overcome the worst of her injuries, but she had since rapidly deteriorated. Sir Rakel had mentioned internal injuries, and expressed everyone’s worst fears, Syren was dying. This had affected Ayda and Brielle the most. Brielle was racked by guilt and spent a lot of her time with Syren, talking to her empty form, Niall knew that the loss Brielle had suffered was a catalyst for her, fuelling her desire to master control. Ayda had become less hostile. She no longer had the energy to fight or argue with Sir Rakel and spent a lot of her time in silence. When she did speak, she was thoughtful and kind, as if she was grateful for their help with Syren but prepared for the worst, waiting for the eternal hand of death to rip more joy from her life.The river they followed was the only constant in their days. It seemed to flow through a never-ending countryside. The Myr River divided the land in two, with the Elves habiting the west and the humans populating the east. It felt strange to Niall that he was within sight of his homeland. He knew Oakwood Town and The Hole was far behind them, near the centre of the region, and as much as he was sure of his path, he yearned for home. He hadn’t spoken to the rest of the Fiends since the night of the raid, and he wondered what became of them. Had Bryce sent out a search party for them or did he know what had happened? Niall wasn’t sure it was a good idea to send a message, if the Elders or Legion learnt anything from the communication it could risk everything. He couldn’t handle the thought of bringing the Legion to the Fiends doorstep, he was sure they could handle themselves against armed opponents, but they would be easy prey to any Mage the Legion sent.They continued north. The forest that surrounded them grew sparse. Across the river the forest was as dense and dark as it had always been, they had not seen a town or village for a long time, the north was abandoned. The landscape of Myrliar was changing, the trees of the forest had slowly been disappearing the further they moved, and they would often travel hours before seeing anything green. The ground beneath their feet had been steadily shifting from a delicious, healthy foliage underfoot into what could only be described as dust and sand. They had entered the outskirts of the wastes. Sir Rakel had promised that by following the river they would avoid going through the dry, dangerous land of the wastes. It had been a good idea, Niall agreed. Ayda had been intent on hiding in the wastes, but from a distance, Niall could not see how they would have survived. If the stories were true, then the centuries old magic had parched the land, destroying all in its radius. The nutrients from the earth were scorched, and no life could grow there. There were no plants, no grass, not even weeds. There were no lakes, or ponds or streams from which to source water, and there were no animals hiding in the missing growth. They would not have survived long. Ayda had explained that she hadn’t realised the extent of deprivation of the wastes and muttered a resentful thanks to Sir Rakel for insisting on changing the flawed plan. On the outskirts however, not much changed. The trees and grass were few and far between and there wasn’t much in the way of wild life. Before they had foraged berries and fruit and hunted animals in the wealthy green lands, but now they heavily depended on the river. The river provided sustenance. Fish and water surrounded them, and occasionally they would spot an animal drinking from the river. Elle had become adept at using her magic to trap their next meal, without her it would have been much more difficult. The biggest worry for the group was how visible they had become. They had moved away from the protection and shelter of the thick undergrowth and tall trees and were now visible from any distance. They felt sure they must be spotted, but no-one had a resolution, so they were forced to grit their teeth and continue. Karl had suggested the team split, to deceive any potential trackers, but Elle had decided against this, she believed it imperative that they stuck together. The silence in the group had grown tense, the physical and mental exhaustion was taking its toll on each of them. Everyone was too polite. Laughter had forsaken them, the team had too many woes and too many questions spinning them into a knot that each had decided they were better in silence. Niall spent most of his time with Theo and Karl, it confused him too much to be around Ayda. Her pain was too much for him to bear, he wanted to comfort her, and hold her, as he had always wanted, but he couldn’t allow it. There was too much confusion, they needed clear boundaries and friendship was so much easier than the hurt he could cause. Elle was so intent on her training and with Sir Rakel hauling Syren along, he took solace in the company of his brothers. Just the three of them, how he liked it. Or so he thought.‘You should just tell her.’ Theo had urged. Niall had become skilled at acting deaf whenever the subject of Ayda arose.‘We – me and Karl – know how much she means to you, you never stopped going on about her when we were kids, how many times did you spy on her?’ Theo had jibed.‘It’s not that simple.’ Niall had snapped, attempting to douse his annoyance and end the conversation.‘Course it is, we could die any day, you should tell her.’‘It’s complicated. Even more so now.’ Niall replied quietly. He hated himself for saying it, but he couldn’t shake the truth. He knew what tore at her, he knew that she had lost her friend and that she wore the guilt round her neck like a noose. He understood that it fuelled her instincts of protection towards her family. There was no room for anything else in her life. From what he had seen, she had starved herself of almost everything she was at risk of losing, with the only exception of her small sister. He felt pity for her. She had spent her whole upbringing since losing her Jonas, training herself and she had put every ounce of guilt and sorrow into becoming a weapon for the protection of those she loved but Niall saw her eyes every time Elle mastered something new. She was pleased that her sister could defend herself, but she also felt as he did, surplus to requirements. Elle was able to defend herself and had shown that she didn’t really need them. Karl had pointed this out several times and pushed his will to go home. But Niall would not relent, for some reason he knew that she would need them, and he was sure as hell going to be here when she did. For Elle. For Ayda. But he could not forget his fear, a fear that had grown within him when he first saw the small elf lose control of her power.Their clothes were dusty and chalky by the time they reached the tree line, he found himself amused by the fact that he could no longer tell where his boots stopped, and the ground started. Finally, they had reached the final stage of their walk. Sir Rakel had explained the forest was smaller than the last and that soon they would be able to see the Three Thorn Mountains. Niall hoped they would not have to climb the mountain and prayed that the Temple of Scholars would be easily accessible, as he didn’t think the troupe had enough energy left following the weeks of hiking and rough sleeping. The trees were ancient. Knots and awkward limbs spouted all around them like veins underneath thin skin, the wood creaked tiredly as the wind bristled through the trees’ outstretched arms. Looking up, the sky was hidden beneath layers of thick green leaves giving the surrounding forest a natural cover from the elements. Not much further, he thought to himself with every groaning step… not much further.",

It was true, he thought, if he had not met her all those years ago, she would have killed him at the barn, and he would never have protected her. As it was, now, he would do almost anything for her, but he couldn’t let her know, there was too much at stake.‘After all I’ve put you through, it’s a wonder you have stuck around.’ Ayda smiled sadly.‘I vowed to protect your sister, and I feel as though there is more for me to learn about my people’s magic.’ Niall replied with a protected half-truth. Ayda nodded understandingly, muttering something about Syren she disappeared behind him to check her friend. Syren was laid lifelessly in the litter led by Sir Rakel. There was a time, when they had all believed she had overcome the worst of her injuries, but she had since rapidly deteriorated. Sir Rakel had mentioned internal injuries, and expressed everyone’s worst fears, Syren was dying. This had affected Ayda and Brielle the most. Brielle was racked by guilt and spent a lot of her time with Syren, talking to her empty form, Niall knew that the loss Brielle had suffered was a catalyst for her, fuelling her desire to master control. Ayda had become less hostile. She no longer had the energy to fight or argue with Sir Rakel and spent a lot of her time in silence. When she did speak, she was thoughtful and kind, as if she was grateful for their help with Syren but prepared for the worst, waiting for the eternal hand of death to rip more joy from her life.The river they followed was the only constant in their days. It seemed to flow through a never-ending countryside. The Myr River divided the land in two, with the Elves habiting the west and the humans populating the east. It felt strange to Niall that he was within sight of his homeland. He knew Oakwood Town and The Hole was far behind them, near the centre of the region, and as much as he was sure of his path, he yearned for home. He hadn’t spoken to the rest of the Fiends since the night of the raid, and he wondered what became of them. Had Bryce sent out a search party for them or did he know what had happened? Niall wasn’t sure it was a good idea to send a message, if the Elders or Legion learnt anything from the communication it could risk everything. He couldn’t handle the thought of bringing the Legion to the Fiends doorstep, he was sure they could handle themselves against armed opponents, but they would be easy prey to any Mage the Legion sent.They continued north. The forest that surrounded them grew sparse. Across the river the forest was as dense and dark as it had always been, they had not seen a town or village for a long time, the north was abandoned. The landscape of Myrliar was changing, the trees of the forest had slowly been disappearing the further they moved, and they would often travel hours before seeing anything green. The ground beneath their feet had been steadily shifting from a delicious, healthy foliage underfoot into what could only be described as dust and sand. They had entered the outskirts of the wastes. Sir Rakel had promised that by following the river they would avoid going through the dry, dangerous land of the wastes. It had been a good idea, Niall agreed. Ayda had been intent on hiding in the wastes, but from a distance, Niall could not see how they would have survived. If the stories were true, then the centuries old magic had parched the land, destroying all in its radius. The nutrients from the earth were scorched, and no life could grow there. There were no plants, no grass, not even weeds. There were no lakes, or ponds or streams from which to source water, and there were no animals hiding in the missing growth. They would not have survived long. Ayda had explained that she hadn’t realised the extent of deprivation of the wastes and muttered a resentful thanks to Sir Rakel for insisting on changing the flawed plan. On the outskirts however, not much changed. The trees and grass were few and far between and there wasn’t much in the way of wild life. Before they had foraged berries and fruit and hunted animals in the wealthy green lands, but now they heavily depended on the river. The river provided sustenance. Fish and water surrounded them, and occasionally they would spot an animal drinking from the river. Elle had become adept at using her magic to trap their next meal, without her it would have been much more difficult. The biggest worry for the group was how visible they had become. They had moved away from the protection and shelter of the thick undergrowth and tall trees and were now visible from any distance. They felt sure they must be spotted, but no-one had a resolution, so they were forced to grit their teeth and continue. Karl had suggested the team split, to deceive any potential trackers, but Elle had decided against this, she believed it imperative that they stuck together. The silence in the group had grown tense, the physical and mental exhaustion was taking its toll on each of them. Everyone was too polite. Laughter had forsaken them, the team had too many woes and too many questions spinning them into a knot that each had decided they were better in silence. Niall spent most of his time with Theo and Karl, it confused him too much to be around Ayda. Her pain was too much for him to bear, he wanted to comfort her, and hold her, as he had always wanted, but he couldn’t allow it. There was too much confusion, they needed clear boundaries and friendship was so much easier than the hurt he could cause. Elle was so intent on her training and with Sir Rakel hauling Syren along, he took solace in the company of his brothers. Just the three of them, how he liked it. Or so he thought.‘You should just tell her.’ Theo had urged. Niall had become skilled at acting deaf whenever the subject of Ayda arose.‘We – me and Karl – know how much she means to you, you never stopped going on about her when we were kids, how many times did you spy on her?’ Theo had jibed.‘It’s not that simple.’ Niall had snapped, attempting to douse his annoyance and end the conversation.‘Course it is, we could die any day, you should tell her.’‘It’s complicated. Even more so now.’ Niall replied quietly. He hated himself for saying it, but he couldn’t shake the truth. He knew what tore at her, he knew that she had lost her friend and that she wore the guilt round her neck like a noose. He understood that it fuelled her instincts of protection towards her family. There was no room for anything else in her life. From what he had seen, she had starved herself of almost everything she was at risk of losing, with the only exception of her small sister. He felt pity for her. She had spent her whole upbringing since losing her Jonas, training herself and she had put every ounce of guilt and sorrow into becoming a weapon for the protection of those she loved but Niall saw her eyes every time Elle mastered something new. She was pleased that her sister could defend herself, but she also felt as he did, surplus to requirements. Elle was able to defend herself and had shown that she didn’t really need them. Karl had pointed this out several times and pushed his will to go home. But Niall would not relent, for some reason he knew that she would need them, and he was sure as hell going to be here when she did. For Elle. For Ayda. But he could not forget his fear, a fear that had grown within him when he first saw the small elf lose control of her power.Their clothes were dusty and chalky by the time they reached the tree line, he found himself amused by the fact that he could no longer tell where his boots stopped, and the ground started. Finally, they had reached the final stage of their walk. Sir Rakel had explained the forest was smaller than the last and that soon they would be able to see the Three Thorn Mountains. Niall hoped they would not have to climb the mountain and prayed that the Temple of Scholars would be easily accessible, as he didn’t think the troupe had enough energy left following the weeks of hiking and rough sleeping. The trees were ancient. Knots and awkward limbs spouted all around them like veins underneath thin skin, the wood creaked tiredly as the wind bristled through the trees’ outstretched arms. Looking up, the sky was hidden beneath layers of thick green leaves giving the surrounding forest a natural cover from the elements. Not much further, he thought to himself with every groaning step… not much further.",

      "content": "14 – ELLEElle gasped as she took in the sight before her. The Three Thorn Mountains stood higher than the clouds and wider than she could see. The Pearl White Mountains of her home felt unimpressive, compared to the mass of sharp grey rock glaring down on her. She was an insect gazing up at the tower of jagged rock, she strained her head as far back as she could, taking in the sheer size of the monstrous formation, and felt herself stumble backwards, dizzied by its formidable magnitude. She knew that no one could ever have climbed these Mountains, they were too deadly and there was no route through or over. The Three Thorns Mountains was named for its three peaks, that she knew from old maps she had been shown, but their reach extended deep into the sky. Sounds of wonder came from her companions, knowing she wasn’t the only one seeing it for the first time, she took a moment to examine her friend’s reactions. Ayda was stood transfixed, a great image of the Thorns reflected in her eye. Niall and Theo were gazing in wonder, mouths agape, for the first time ever, they were silent, even Sir Rakel was intimidated by the colossus. Snow covered the teeth of the mountains and thick white clouds buried the summits. Elle’s eye was drawn to a glint in the mountain face to the right of her. Like a magpie, she searched for the source of the shimmer. An artery had burst from deep within the Mountains, and water had broken free of its restraints through a crack in its skin. Now that she had noticed the great waterfall smashing its route through the rock, she could hear the song of flowing water beneath the deafening sound of tumbling water. This waterfall had given birth to the Myr River, the lifeblood of the mountain had been dividing the Elven and Human Race for centuries. Examining the vast Mountains, Brielle noticed there was a worrying lack of something. The Temple.‘Where is it?’ She asked Sir Rakel, he shook his head.‘I don’t know, your Father always said to follow the river, I’ve never seen it.’ He explained, as confused as she was. Elle sighed, now what? Ayda had snapped out of her stupor.‘I knew it,’ She snarled, pushing Sir Rakel away from Brielle, ‘You’ve lured us here, into the open, for no reason! Traitor!’‘Stop it.’ Elle said weakly, without conviction. She felt disappointed. She felt lost. What was the plan now, they had no idea where the Temple was!‘No Elle, you can’t stick up for him! We’re in the wide open, we’ve run out of supplies, Syren has been unconscious for days and we know we’re being hunted. He’s lured us into a trap!’ Ayda snapped aggressively. Elle had nothing to say. She felt cold to the core, Sir Rakel had been a light in her dark world with his plans and his insight, but he had let her down. She feared the worst, desperation crashed over her like a wave. Had Ayda been right all along, was Sir Rakel really her enemy? The Old Protector looked abashed, shocked and hurt. Ayda was stood facing him anger burning through her, searing great holes in him, he looked lost.‘Look! Someone’s there!’ Niall announced to the group. Elle spun around to where Niall was pointing. Sure enough, a small figure in the distance could be seen walking quickly along the river towards the mountains. It seemed he had been nestled behind a cluster of trees at the base of the fall. Elle watched with interest as he quickly and confidently climbed over rocks and disappeared into the mountain.‘Where was he going?’ Elle wondered.‘Maybe there’s an entrance there?’ Sir Rakel said eagerly, looking hopefully at Elle.‘Or maybe this is part of your trap!’ Ayda smacked him brutally.‘Ayda!’ Elle wailed.‘If I had wanted her dead she’d be dead by now!’ Sir Rakel said, his tone fierce, ‘This Temple is our only lead and I want to find it as much as you!’ Elle had already made up her mind. She had to find the Temple. She was tired of the bickering and the arguments. Leaving the others behind, she briskly set off towards the rocks. Theo and Karl followed her dutifully. The ground beneath her feet was unstable and uneven. Patches of grass could be seen dotted closer to the river but mostly the ground before her was layered with rock and dust, she felt as though she was trekking across the roots of the Mountains. She heard the wheels of Syren’s transport crunch behind her and the clicking of hooves against rock and guessed her team was with her now. Looking back over her shoulder she could see the outline of the Forest beyond the wastes that had been her shelter for a long time. She was leaving the luscious, fertile lands for a dry, chalk-like future.‘Are you sure about this Princess?’ She heard Niall say as he came alongside her.‘I need to find the Temple, it’s worth the risk.’ She nodded. She couldn’t believe how much she was hoping for Sir Rakel to be right. She wanted more than anything to find a pathway, or a door, anything that might lead her to the Temple. The Temple held her answers, she was so sure of that and she had become so dependent on finding it and finding herself. She was so close, she could feel it. It had been a long road, a long journey to get here, they had been through so much. She could hardly remember the carefree elf she had been, she could barely remember the faces of her friends back at the Stone Castle. All she knew now, was that she had a fight coming, and Elle couldn’t afford to be a scared child anymore. The mountain was drawing close, Elle had to steady herself to stop herself breaking into a run. Those at the front began climbing. Walls of rock framed the base of the mountain, Niall helped Elle over the bigger ones, with Sir Rakel close behind, ready to catch her. Finally, they reached the rock where the man had disappeared behind.‘Wait, Princess!’ Sir Rakel demanded, as Elle began the final climb. Elle faltered and looked at him.‘It should be me to go first…’ Sir Rakel began.‘Like hell!’ Ayda sneered, catching up with them, ‘Like we’d give you a chance to announce us!’‘I failed your Father, I will not fail you now, please,’ Sir Rakel ignored Ayda, his eyes bored into Elle’s determined glare, ‘I have brought you this far.’ Elle nodded and stepped aside to clear the rock for the Protectors ascent. With a few grunts and clinks of his golden armour, the old Elf hauled himself over with his strength and disappeared. Ayda glared darkly at Elle. Brielle knew she had angered her sister. At every turn she and Ayda had disagreed. Ayda had been furious at the group’s acceptance of the ‘traitor’ and could not forgive him for the loss of their Father. Elle had more hope than that. She had hope that this Protector, who she had once loved as an Uncle, was still that same Elf now. The little Princess had not been ready to abandon him, she had lost too much already. The litter that contained Syren had been hidden behind rocks with the remaining horses, too cumbersome to heave through the maze of rock that they had struggled to climb over. Karl and Theo had volunteered to stay with her. Elle feared for Syren, they were running out of time, Elle guessed her friend would not hold on for much longer, she was surprised she had made it this far. It felt like they waited an age, Ayda had started pacing, glaring at the spot Sir Rakel had last been stood as if he were still there. A few times she had mentioned to the others about running, and leaving him, but Elle was adamant she was staying, this was their best hope, she was sure of it. Finally, the crunch of grit reached her, and she knew he had returned, his old face appeared over the rock and he was beaming.“Come quickly!” He gestured, disappearing once more. With that each of them clambered over the rock, Elle as the smallest, stumbling slightly on the climb. Ayda’s eyes were cautious, wandering and scanning every inch of their surroundings, her hand never leaving her sword. Sliding down the face of the rock, Elle hit the ground hard, grit scraping the skin on her palms. A father like hand lifted her from her fall, Sir Rakel was smiling from ear to ear. His eyes moved to a point behind her and she followed his gaze, noticing Niall and Ayda were also following closely. A cloaked man stood in the entrance of a shadowy cavern, a jagged mouth in the wall had been concealed by the rocks they had climbed. His face was masked by the dark shadow cast by his hooded cloak, which was shabby, torn and frayed at the hem. Elle wondered if this was the man they had followed, but realised, as he moved closer, that this man was much older and very frail. His hand shook violently on his stick as he approached them. He drew close and he lowered his hood. Elle bit back a gasp. The man was old, and he was human. His eyes were a pure and brilliant white, staring unmoving a spot behind her head. He was blind she realised. His head was full of thick grey hair and his beard framed his broad chin.‘Princess Brielle, Princess Ayda. Follow me.’ He said. Elle was soothed by his voice. If she had known her Grandfather, this is how she would like him to sound. His voice was warm, and full of timeless wisdom. Ayda stepped before her before Elle could follow the Old Man into the cavern.‘You’re just going to trust him?’ Ayda asked, incredulously.‘Yes.’ Elle said simply.‘How can you trust so blindly, after all that has been?!’‘Stay if you wish. I’m going in.’ Elle shrugged. She was tired of fighting this battle. The Old Man was frail, blind and warm hearted, and she found she trusted him like an old friend. Shrugging, Elle gestured to Sir Rakel who took the lead, and followed him. Brielle guessed that Ayda and Niall had followed as she heard their footsteps echo through the cavern behind her. It wasn’t as dark as she had feared, the walls of the cavern had been chiselled smooth and circular holes had been carved out of the walls to let the light in. It was more of a stone corridor than a mountainous tavern. Stone masons had taken great care with this walkway, the walls were smooth, the floors were level and the windows were perfectly positioned and sized to let in light and be unnoticeable from the outside. Elle marvelled at the skill of the Old Man, being blind did not seem to hinder him in the slightest as he traced his stick along the base of the walls. Although they had caught up with him quickly and were eager to reach their destination, they patiently followed him through the cavern. Karl and Theo could be heard hauling Syren’s stretcher behind them, much to Elle’s relief. She could not suffer to lose any of her friends. On they walked, reaching an incline, their walk became slower still as they followed the corridor higher up the mountain, still surrounded by neatly cut rock. As they climbed higher with the gradient, a rush of water grew louder and louder, resonating through the cavern, until they could no longer hear their footsteps echoing around them. Ahead of them, a dim light was visible as the exit of the corridor approached. Leaving the tunnel, Elle marvelled in amazement at the beauty flowing through the mountain. They had reached the top of the waterfall. To her right she had a view across Myrliar and the Human lands. She could see the stretches of forests and even the wastes they had not long left. The trail of the River Myr meandered into the distance. A large pool of water lay before her, each droplet of fluid waiting to breach the mountain and plunge into the river below. To the left, Elle could see several smaller streams that fed the pool and, in the distance, was a sight that took her breath away. The Temple. The streams reflected light far in to the cave, beyond that, torches were blazing lighting up the most amazing building she had ever seen. The Old Man had stopped near the exit of the corridor, he was smiling.‘Welcome to the Temple of Scholars,’ He said, chuckling, ‘I remember the first time I laid my eyes on it too, it is something you have to see to believe - and even then, you may have to pinch yourself.’ That was certainly true, Elle thought. She could never have guessed from outside that this could have been built within the Mountain itself. The torches lit up a magnificent collection of interconnected domes carved from the Mountain. The Temple, although not taller than the Stone Castle once was, it was wider and in the dark, when lit purely by torches, had a magical feel to it. Bridges of rock were formed over the flowing streams and she could make out lit paths in the distance far from their position.‘Is this the only route in?’ Sir Rakel asked the Old Man, looking around.‘No, this is the back entrance, very few know of it, and even fewer can climb the other side,’ The Old Man chuckled again, ‘There are two main entrances, much grander, but both watched. This is the best way to keep you unnoticed.’ The Old Man gestured for them to follow and led them along the glistening pool of water.‘Are we not going into the Temple?’ Ayda asked from behind.‘Good heavens no, you’d be killed on sight.’‘Because the Scholars work with the Elders?’ Elle asked.‘Not all, but most.’ The Old Scholar sighed,‘Why don’t you?’‘Because I know something they don’t.’ he signalled for them to keep quiet. In the cave, sound travelled easier and quicker through the air, and along the water. They had to remain unnoticed. Their guide led them closer to the Temple, keeping to the shadows of the rocky cave. Elle wondered how the Scholar knew where the shadows were but said nothing as she followed closely. The Temple grew more impressive the closer they moved, the domes were smooth, and Elle could make out intricate gold detail patterned along the walls of each building. Elaborate decorative archways marked entrances and huge golden doors emitted a yellow glow from the flickering torches. Closer still Elle could see the reflection of the lights in the streams flowing around the domes, the floors nearer to the Temple were painted gold with gemstones sunk into the floor like mosaics. She had never seen such a sight of splendour. Red cloaks could be spotted prowling the exterior. The Legion had the Temple of Scholars heavily guarded. The Old Man was right, they would all be snuffed out as quick as a candle if seen. Elle found herself growing nervous the closer they moved. Butterflies were flapping their wings furiously in the pit of her stomach. Their guide was an expert at moving in the shadows, she wondered how he could see. Soon, they found themselves moving away from the Temple and away from the danger that came with it. Finally, they reached a strong oak door imbedded in a rough wall of rock. Elle spotted many tens of similar doors nearby and hoped no-one would appear from them. A click of a lock, the oak door was open, and they were ushered quickly and quietly inside. Elle had not realised how cold she was until the warmth of the fire embraced her. They had walked into a cosy room, that she presumed was the Scholar’s living quarters. Cosy armchairs relaxed in front of the simmering fire, bookcases lined the walls of the room, thousands of books nestled on their shelves. A large table was positioned against a stone wall, burdened heavily with parchment, more books and odd bits of strange coloured stone. Two oak doors led off the room to the Scholar’s bedchamber and private quarters. Groaning slightly, the Old Man locked the door and sidled into the room, and slowly lowered himself into his favourite armchair before the fire, breathing heavily.‘Your friend is dying.’ He said sadly, cutting in before they could speak.‘Can you help her?’ Ayda asked desperately.‘I can’t,’ He replied, ‘But I know someone who may be able to help.’ He took his walking stick in his hand and knocked three times on the cracked slate hearth surrounding the fire. The sound echoed slightly. Elle watched expectantly, waiting for something to happen. She could sense the anticipation of her friends around her, all staring patiently at the old slate. Maybe he was crazy? Elle thought. What was he hoping to happen? Suddenly, the sound of grinding stone on slate filled her ears, as the fragmented slate lifted away from the hearth, revealing a dark stairwell leading down. Elle’s curiosity got the better of her as she moved closer and peered in through the gap in the floor. The gap was small enough to let one person through at a time. In the dark, the stone stairs leading into the dark belly beneath them looked difficult, they would need to be careful. Elle looked back at the Old Man who had not moved at all.‘Go on, Princess.’ He nodded at her.‘How can we trust you? We don’t know you!’ Ayda cautioned Elle.‘Right now, your friend doesn’t have time for me to explain. If you want to save her, move.’Could she trust him? She thought, her confidence in him wavering slightly. Was she about to walk willingly into a trap? A prison that she had just watched open? The Old Man had said they could help Syren, was this a risk worth taking? The faded appearance of her red headed friend pushed her on. Waiting until Ayda was by her side, she carefully stepped on to the stone and began her descent. The steps were uneven, she lost her footing early on. Putting her hands out either side to touch the wall as a guide, she made her way lower and lower. She wondered if it would be safer for her to crawl down on her bottom but decided against it. Her friends had followed her down, she could hear their boots as they too, slipped on the deceiving ground. It wasn’t as dark as she thought, small candles were flickering in their sconce, casting dim, golden light to dance warmly along the cold walls. Finally, she reached the bottom. She gasped. She wanted to run far, far away from this place, she shimmied backwards into her sister, who groaned and moved her aside.‘What’s wrong with you?’ Ayda asked, looking down at Elle’s expression of shock.‘This-this place!’ Elle stammered, the rest of the group piled into the room, Syren being carried along by Karl and Theo. Brielle could not take her eyes from the large domed room. Every inch of stone was covered in glistening crystal, everywhere her eyes scanned, from the floors, to the ceiling, the crystals glittered like stars against the dark stone. It tugged at her deep inside, it looked so familiar…‘Bring her in, bring her in!’ A young female voice sounded rushed. Brielle jumped as she saw a young woman, about the same age as Ayda emerge from an archway at the end of the dome, and frantically gesture to them. Karl and Theo quickly carried Syren as gently as possible across the empty dome and through the archway. The other’s followed quickly. Elle was left alone. They did not understand the significance of this room, she thought. To her, it felt, like a dark version of home. Like she had been here before.‘This room is familiar to you?’ The Old Man was at her side, she had been caught in her reverie and had not heard him emerge.‘Yes…’ Brielle responded quietly, ‘It’s the Ritual Chamber back at home.’She had remembered why it caused her such fear, such a deep ache. To her, the Ritual Chamber of her home had caused all the misery that followed, she wished she had never stepped foot in the chamber. She had been such a fool to be so excited about her summons, and she had lost everything in doing so.‘Look closer at the crystals.’ The Old Man said simply. Reluctantly, Elle got closer to the walls beside her. The crystals were an inch or so wide, jagged and dotted in the stonework across the walls, floors and ceiling. They were also black. A deep, beautiful ebony. Her breath hitched. They were not the same. She remembered the crystals in the Castle Chamber as being clear as water.‘What are they?’ She asked, feeling more at ease in the mysterious dome.‘They are my most important discovery,’ The Old Man said seriously, ‘soon I will tell you of them, but for now, promise me, that you will not use magic unless instructed by myself.’Elle’s curiosity piqued. His most important discovery?‘Why are you helping us?’ Elle asked,‘Your Father made me promise, besides, I would have anyway. You are far too important.’She opened her mouth to press the Scholar for more, until she saw Ayda and Sir Rakel beckon her enthusiastically from the archway. Remembering Syren, she ran to them without looking back. Ayda looked at her happily. ‘You are not going to believe this!’ Ayda beamed. Brielle felt elated at her sister’s excitement, what had they found? The Princess followed her sister into the room beyond the archway, it was like the last, black crystals adorned every inch of the smaller, domed room. Much like the living room they had left, this room also had books lining the walls and scrolls and parchment along desks and shelves. Amazement shook her body as she saw what was happening in the centre. Her friends had gathered around a table, their faces were pale, and their eyes were wide as they contemplated what they were seeing. Elle felt the hair on her arms and neck stand up, as shock crawled over her body like a spider.Syren was led peacefully on the table, but she was glowing. Brielle could not move, she knew that glow. She had been practising her magic and seen that white light so many times. Magic was flowing through Syren! The white light was so bright that Elle nearly missed the hands resting upon Syren’s body. Following the arms, squinting against the gleam, she noticed that the hands belonged to the young lady who had called them. Her eyes hurt, the glare from the light was strong in the dark, underground rooms, she raised her hand to shield herself. Ayda immediately noticed.‘What’s wrong?’ She asked worried, placing a hand on her shoulder.‘The light – it’s too bright!’ Elle whispered.‘I knew she was going to heal her, but I didn’t know she had magic!’ Ayda exclaimed wide-eyed. The light pierced her eyes for mere moments before she adjusted. Finally, able to focus without wincing through the pain, Elle moved closer to examine what was happening. Elle watched as beads of light emerged from the outstretched hands of the healer and disappeared into Syren’s body, Elle could see that much magic was being used as Syren’s body glowed. The healer’s eyes were scrunched shut in concentration and only opened once the glow had begun to dim. She had finished. Elle looked at Syren’s face expectantly. The magical light dimmed to nothing as the healer pulled away from her body. Syren still did not move.‘What happened? Didn’t it work?’ Elle asked timidly, waiting for Syren’s eyes to burst open.‘The Magic can only do so much, little one, her body now needs to do the rest.’ The lady replied.‘What did you do?’ Ayda asked, approaching cautiously, afraid of the unknown.‘She had internal injuries that caused her to gradually lose a lot of blood, much longer and she would be lost.’‘Now what?’‘Now we wait for her body to recuperate and replenish itself. All her injuries are healed,’ The healer explained, ‘Now, if you would be so kind, please settle her in that room behind you.’ She gestured to the small arch leading off the dome. Karl and Theo obligingly carried her into the room. Elle felt a rush of relief, that was mirrored on Ayda’s face, Syren was going to be OK. The healer put her hand around Elle’s shoulder and embraced her gently. It was a warm gesture, and one that made Elle instantly love the young lady who had saved her friend.‘Come, little one, we have much to discuss.’ She said.‘You’re a mage?’ Elle blurted out excitedly. Brielle was awed by the display of power she had seen and felt a bond with this mage. She had felt so alone before, shouldering the responsibility of magic that no one understood, now she had a mage as an ally. Someone who could teach her and understand her.‘I am.’ The woman replied kindly. Elle, Ayda, Niall and Sir Rakel were following her back up the stone steps, towards the warm living room above. Elle had so many questions, she couldn’t wait to reach their destination.‘Can you teach me?’‘Partly…’‘Can I heal like you?’‘Maybe…’‘Are we alone?’The questions poured from her like water from a tankard. The healer barely had time to answer before she was hit by the next onslaught of questions. Finally, they reached the living room where the Old Scholar was waiting, comfortable back in his arm chair. He gestured for them to sit around him as the Healer slid the slate hearth back into place.‘I see you have met my friend Nhima,’ He smiled. Elle was fascinated by them both, how the Scholar could smile at her, knowing where she was sat when he was blind was beyond her.‘Yes, she’s a Mage, like me.’ Elle explained breathlessly. The Old Scholar chuckled.‘Who are you?’ Ayda asked him bluntly.‘I am Scholar Byran, or just Byran now really…’ He muttered to himself, fidgeting with his robes.‘You’re not a Scholar anymore?’ Sir Rakel asked, confused.‘Oh no, too old my dear boy.’ Byran muttered. Elle saw Nhima’s eyes flicker to Byran’s and guessed something was being left unspoken. Brielle continued.‘Are you the Scholar who taught our Father to use his magic?’ She asked, anticipating the answer she was sure to come.‘I am. The King at the time – your Grandfather – begged me, I accepted.’‘Can you teach me?’‘I promised your Father that I would, but I fear I will be of less use to you.’ Byran sighed.‘You were not blind when you mentored the King.’ Sir Rakel pointed out.‘Who are you?’ Byran asked the Old Knight, his face faltering slightly.‘Sir Rakel, Chief Protector to the King and Head of the Elven Army.’ Sir Rakel responded proudly.‘Yes, yes, I remember you, the King was very fond of you.’ Byran nodded. At this, Ayda shot Rakel an evil glare as he looked guiltily to the floor. Elle knew he was going to regret his actions until the day he died.‘If I am to teach you, there are rules you must follow.’ Byran began, Elle sat up eagerly.‘You are not allowed to use magic, anywhere other than below. The training rooms below were designed for your Father and this is the only place you can use magic.’‘Why?’ Elle asked.‘The Scholars here are not your friends. If they hear, sense or see your magic, there is nothing we can do to stop them. The Legion is strong here and they will hunt you down,’ Nhima replied softly.‘The rules also apply to me, for they are no friend of mine.”‘They want to kill you too?’ Ayda asked her.‘Me, her, any Mage. Their aim is the extinction of Magic.’‘So, we are not alone?’ Elle whispered, excited and scared at the same time.‘No, little one, there are many, many more of us, they just don’t know it.’ Nhima smiled sadly.‘What do you mean?’ Elle’s brows were furrowed, confused.‘You have been to the Ritual, Princess, tell us what you saw.’ Byran asked her kindly. Brielle felt the gaze of the other’s lock onto her. She retold her story. She told them all the Elves that had joined her in the room, told them of the blue mark on their wrists, all with differing brightness, told them of the orbs of light she now knew to be magic, and of the crystals on the wall and the similarity with the ones in the basement training rooms. Relaying it all back to her companions, aloud, sparked answers inside her head.‘The other Elves are Mages!’ Elle announced, shocked. Byran nodded.‘Let me explain what I have only guessed at over the years,’ Byran began, ‘I have long suspected that Magic is still as abundant as before. First your Father came to me, then Nhima and now yourself, there are never three discrepancies. I then turned to the Ritual. The Chamber itself was a much-researched development. I have long suspected, following your Father’s descriptions, that this was a way of controlling magic. It was only then, with your description, Princess that I can confirm my suspicions.’‘What – why?’ Elle stammered, perplexed.‘You can see the flow of magic. You see it as a light, and you described seeing the light leaving the Elves around you and travelling together to the centre of the Chamber. I believe the Elders are channelling the magic to themselves.’‘You mean the Elders are stealing magic?’ Ayda asked, trying to keep up. ‘How can they possibly do that?’ Niall asked.‘With these Crystals.’ Byran held one clear crystal and one ebony crystal in his hand.‘What do they do?’ Elle asked, intrigued.‘The clear ones absorb magic. The ebony stones block it. This is my belief.’‘How can we prove it?’ Elle asked.‘We will experiment, when the time is right. Now we have you here, you can watch the magic.’ Nhima smiled.‘Why are they stealing magic?’ Sir Rakel asked.‘Control,’ Ayda cut in, ‘Magic destroyed our lands and destroyed our peoples, they want it eradicated and to be the only ones with power.’‘I believe that is partly the reason.’ Byran nodded.‘How so?’ Ayda shot him a look.‘Magic is all but extinct. No one feels its presence anymore, so why steal it unless you have something to gain? I haven’t figured this part out yet.’ Something didn’t add up to Brielle. There were thousands of Mages in her Kingdom, yet the Elders only wanted her dead? They even left her Father untouched over the years before the uprising.‘Why do they want me dead?’ The question left her lips without permission. She hated how scared she sounded.‘The Elders target anyone who uses their magic or whose magic is a threat.’ Nhima responded simply.‘I’d never used mine, nor am I threat.’ Elle replied.‘And Father used magic, and they never targeted him.’ Ayda added.‘Your Father hid his Magic how I taught him, they knew he had magic, but could never trace him using it. That is why it is essential not to use your magic unless you are in the training rooms. They can trace you here.’‘But why-’‘That’s enough for today, you are all tired and need rest. Tomorrow we will begin your training Princess. Get some sleep.’ The Scholar dismissed, and without another word, he locked himself into his private chambers and left them with Nhima. Elle was annoyed, she had some answers, but nothing definite. The Old Scholar had many ideas and explanations but no proof, and he still had not answered why the Elders want her – a child elf – dead when so many Mages are alive! She allowed herself to be ushered back down the stairs towards the training halls again, lost in her thoughts and confusion, she realised she was being led to a corridor with many doors, Nhima showed her friends to their own room, and then finally came to Elle, opening the door she walked inside. The room was small and brightly lit, sconces lined the walls. This room was also covered head to toe in the black crystals. Elle thought he must have spent a long time creating these training rooms. The room contained a small bed and wooden wardrobe, opening it, she was relieved to see a selection of simple linen clothes, including a nightdress.‘Your sister is in the room opposite you, if you need her,’ Nhima advised, ‘I am next door.’Elle nodded appreciatively as Nhima closed the door quietly behind her. She was exhausted. Flinging herself down on the bed she stifled a yawn. The bed was comfortable, much more comfortable than the bed of leaves Ayda had been creating for her every night. It pained her to remember the last night she spent in her grand bed when Amie would brush out her hair before sleep. How far away those nights were, they didn’t seem real to her anymore, a distant dream perhaps. Her head was whirling with thoughts, plans, ideas and worries, she didn’t think sleep would come to her. She tried to imagine an empty box, peaceful, dark and quiet so she could rest. Like a beacon, however, her thoughts would come smashing back to her through the artificial serenity. She decided her dirty clothes may not be helping. Throwing them to the floor she shimmied into her clean, plain nightdress. It was nothing fancy or decorative like back at the Castle, but it was fresh. The scent and softness alone relaxed her. Lying back under the sheets, she felt herself ease a little, and finally, she slept.",

The Pearl White Mountains of her home felt unimpressive, compared to the mass of sharp grey rock glaring down on her. She was an insect gazing up at the tower of jagged rock, she strained her head as far back as she could, taking in the sheer size of the monstrous formation, and felt herself stumble backwards, dizzied by its formidable magnitude. She knew that no one could ever have climbed these Mountains, they were too deadly and there was no route through or over. The Three Thorns Mountains was named for its three peaks, that she knew from old maps she had been shown, but their reach extended deep into the sky. Sounds of wonder came from her companions, knowing she wasn’t the only one seeing it for the first time, she took a moment to examine her friend’s reactions. Ayda was stood transfixed, a great image of the Thorns reflected in her eye. Niall and Theo were gazing in wonder, mouths agape, for the first time ever, they were silent, even Sir Rakel was intimidated by the colossus. Snow covered the teeth of the mountains and thick white clouds buried the summits. Elle’s eye was drawn to a glint in the mountain face to the right of her. Like a magpie, she searched for the source of the shimmer. An artery had burst from deep within the Mountains, and water had broken free of its restraints through a crack in its skin. Now that she had noticed the great waterfall smashing its route through the rock, she could hear the song of flowing water beneath the deafening sound of tumbling water. This waterfall had given birth to the Myr River, the lifeblood of the mountain had been dividing the Elven and Human Race for centuries. Examining the vast Mountains, Brielle noticed there was a worrying lack of something. The Temple.‘Where is it?’ She asked Sir Rakel, he shook his head.‘I don’t know, your Father always said to follow the river, I’ve never seen it.’ He explained, as confused as she was. Elle sighed, now what? Ayda had snapped out of her stupor.‘I knew it,’ She snarled, pushing Sir Rakel away from Brielle, ‘You’ve lured us here, into the open, for no reason! Traitor!’‘Stop it.’ Elle said weakly, without conviction. She felt disappointed. She felt lost. What was the plan now, they had no idea where the Temple was!‘No Elle, you can’t stick up for him! We’re in the wide open, we’ve run out of supplies, Syren has been unconscious for days and we know we’re being hunted. He’s lured us into a trap!’ Ayda snapped aggressively. Elle had nothing to say. She felt cold to the core, Sir Rakel had been a light in her dark world with his plans and his insight, but he had let her down. She feared the worst, desperation crashed over her like a wave. Had Ayda been right all along, was Sir Rakel really her enemy? The Old Protector looked abashed, shocked and hurt. Ayda was stood facing him anger burning through her, searing great holes in him, he looked lost.‘Look! Someone’s there!’ Niall announced to the group. Elle spun around to where Niall was pointing. Sure enough, a small figure in the distance could be seen walking quickly along the river towards the mountains. It seemed he had been nestled behind a cluster of trees at the base of the fall. Elle watched with interest as he quickly and confidently climbed over rocks and disappeared into the mountain.‘Where was he going?’ Elle wondered.‘Maybe there’s an entrance there?’ Sir Rakel said eagerly, looking hopefully at Elle.‘Or maybe this is part of your trap!’ Ayda smacked him brutally.‘Ayda!’ Elle wailed.‘If I had wanted her dead she’d be dead by now!’ Sir Rakel said, his tone fierce, ‘This Temple is our only lead and I want to find it as much as you!’ Elle had already made up her mind. She had to find the Temple. She was tired of the bickering and the arguments. Leaving the others behind, she briskly set off towards the rocks. Theo and Karl followed her dutifully. The ground beneath her feet was unstable and uneven. Patches of grass could be seen dotted closer to the river but mostly the ground before her was layered with rock and dust, she felt as though she was trekking across the roots of the Mountains. She heard the wheels of Syren’s transport crunch behind her and the clicking of hooves against rock and guessed her team was with her now. Looking back over her shoulder she could see the outline of the Forest beyond the wastes that had been her shelter for a long time. She was leaving the luscious, fertile lands for a dry, chalk-like future.‘Are you sure about this Princess?’ She heard Niall say as he came alongside her.‘I need to find the Temple, it’s worth the risk.’ She nodded. She couldn’t believe how much she was hoping for Sir Rakel to be right. She wanted more than anything to find a pathway, or a door, anything that might lead her to the Temple. The Temple held her answers, she was so sure of that and she had become so dependent on finding it and finding herself. She was so close, she could feel it. It had been a long road, a long journey to get here, they had been through so much. She could hardly remember the carefree elf she had been, she could barely remember the faces of her friends back at the Stone Castle. All she knew now, was that she had a fight coming, and Elle couldn’t afford to be a scared child anymore. The mountain was drawing close, Elle had to steady herself to stop herself breaking into a run. Those at the front began climbing. Walls of rock framed the base of the mountain, Niall helped Elle over the bigger ones, with Sir Rakel close behind, ready to catch her. Finally, they reached the rock where the man had disappeared behind.‘Wait, Princess!’ Sir Rakel demanded, as Elle began the final climb. Elle faltered and looked at him.‘It should be me to go first…’ Sir Rakel began.‘Like hell!’ Ayda sneered, catching up with them, ‘Like we’d give you a chance to announce us!’‘I failed your Father, I will not fail you now, please,’ Sir Rakel ignored Ayda, his eyes bored into Elle’s determined glare, ‘I have brought you this far.’ Elle nodded and stepped aside to clear the rock for the Protectors ascent. With a few grunts and clinks of his golden armour, the old Elf hauled himself over with his strength and disappeared. Ayda glared darkly at Elle. Brielle knew she had angered her sister. At every turn she and Ayda had disagreed. Ayda had been furious at the group’s acceptance of the ‘traitor’ and could not forgive him for the loss of their Father. Elle had more hope than that. She had hope that this Protector, who she had once loved as an Uncle, was still that same Elf now. The little Princess had not been ready to abandon him, she had lost too much already. The litter that contained Syren had been hidden behind rocks with the remaining horses, too cumbersome to heave through the maze of rock that they had struggled to climb over. Karl and Theo had volunteered to stay with her. Elle feared for Syren, they were running out of time, Elle guessed her friend would not hold on for much longer, she was surprised she had made it this far. It felt like they waited an age, Ayda had started pacing, glaring at the spot Sir Rakel had last been stood as if he were still there. A few times she had mentioned to the others about running, and leaving him, but Elle was adamant she was staying, this was their best hope, she was sure of it. Finally, the crunch of grit reached her, and she knew he had returned, his old face appeared over the rock and he was beaming.“Come quickly!” He gestured, disappearing once more. With that each of them clambered over the rock, Elle as the smallest, stumbling slightly on the climb. Ayda’s eyes were cautious, wandering and scanning every inch of their surroundings, her hand never leaving her sword. Sliding down the face of the rock, Elle hit the ground hard, grit scraping the skin on her palms. A father like hand lifted her from her fall, Sir Rakel was smiling from ear to ear. His eyes moved to a point behind her and she followed his gaze, noticing Niall and Ayda were also following closely. A cloaked man stood in the entrance of a shadowy cavern, a jagged mouth in the wall had been concealed by the rocks they had climbed. His face was masked by the dark shadow cast by his hooded cloak, which was shabby, torn and frayed at the hem. Elle wondered if this was the man they had followed, but realised, as he moved closer, that this man was much older and very frail. His hand shook violently on his stick as he approached them. He drew close and he lowered his hood. Elle bit back a gasp. The man was old, and he was human. His eyes were a pure and brilliant white, staring unmoving a spot behind her head. He was blind she realised. His head was full of thick grey hair and his beard framed his broad chin.‘Princess Brielle, Princess Ayda. Follow me.’ He said. Elle was soothed by his voice. If she had known her Grandfather, this is how she would like him to sound. His voice was warm, and full of timeless wisdom. Ayda stepped before her before Elle could follow the Old Man into the cavern.‘You’re just going to trust him?’ Ayda asked, incredulously.‘Yes.’ Elle said simply.‘How can you trust so blindly, after all that has been?!’‘Stay if you wish. I’m going in.’ Elle shrugged. She was tired of fighting this battle. The Old Man was frail, blind and warm hearted, and she found she trusted him like an old friend. Shrugging, Elle gestured to Sir Rakel who took the lead, and followed him. Brielle guessed that Ayda and Niall had followed as she heard their footsteps echo through the cavern behind her. It wasn’t as dark as she had feared, the walls of the cavern had been chiselled smooth and circular holes had been carved out of the walls to let the light in. It was more of a stone corridor than a mountainous tavern. Stone masons had taken great care with this walkway, the walls were smooth, the floors were level and the windows were perfectly positioned and sized to let in light and be unnoticeable from the outside. Elle marvelled at the skill of the Old Man, being blind did not seem to hinder him in the slightest as he traced his stick along the base of the walls. Although they had caught up with him quickly and were eager to reach their destination, they patiently followed him through the cavern. Karl and Theo could be heard hauling Syren’s stretcher behind them, much to Elle’s relief. She could not suffer to lose any of her friends. On they walked, reaching an incline, their walk became slower still as they followed the corridor higher up the mountain, still surrounded by neatly cut rock. As they climbed higher with the gradient, a rush of water grew louder and louder, resonating through the cavern, until they could no longer hear their footsteps echoing around them. Ahead of them, a dim light was visible as the exit of the corridor approached. Leaving the tunnel, Elle marvelled in amazement at the beauty flowing through the mountain. They had reached the top of the waterfall. To her right she had a view across Myrliar and the Human lands. She could see the stretches of forests and even the wastes they had not long left. The trail of the River Myr meandered into the distance. A large pool of water lay before her, each droplet of fluid waiting to breach the mountain and plunge into the river below. To the left, Elle could see several smaller streams that fed the pool and, in the distance, was a sight that took her breath away. The Temple. The streams reflected light far in to the cave, beyond that, torches were blazing lighting up the most amazing building she had ever seen. The Old Man had stopped near the exit of the corridor, he was smiling.‘Welcome to the Temple of Scholars,’ He said, chuckling, ‘I remember the first time I laid my eyes on it too, it is something you have to see to believe - and even then, you may have to pinch yourself.’ That was certainly true, Elle thought. She could never have guessed from outside that this could have been built within the Mountain itself. The torches lit up a magnificent collection of interconnected domes carved from the Mountain. The Temple, although not taller than the Stone Castle once was, it was wider and in the dark, when lit purely by torches, had a magical feel to it. Bridges of rock were formed over the flowing streams and she could make out lit paths in the distance far from their position.‘Is this the only route in?’ Sir Rakel asked the Old Man, looking around.‘No, this is the back entrance, very few know of it, and even fewer can climb the other side,’ The Old Man chuckled again, ‘There are two main entrances, much grander, but both watched. This is the best way to keep you unnoticed.’ The Old Man gestured for them to follow and led them along the glistening pool of water.‘Are we not going into the Temple?’ Ayda asked from behind.‘Good heavens no, you’d be killed on sight.’‘Because the Scholars work with the Elders?’ Elle asked.‘Not all, but most.’ The Old Scholar sighed,‘Why don’t you?’‘Because I know something they don’t.’ he signalled for them to keep quiet. In the cave, sound travelled easier and quicker through the air, and along the water. They had to remain unnoticed. Their guide led them closer to the Temple, keeping to the shadows of the rocky cave. Elle wondered how the Scholar knew where the shadows were but said nothing as she followed closely. The Temple grew more impressive the closer they moved, the domes were smooth, and Elle could make out intricate gold detail patterned along the walls of each building. Elaborate decorative archways marked entrances and huge golden doors emitted a yellow glow from the flickering torches. Closer still Elle could see the reflection of the lights in the streams flowing around the domes, the floors nearer to the Temple were painted gold with gemstones sunk into the floor like mosaics. She had never seen such a sight of splendour. Red cloaks could be spotted prowling the exterior. The Legion had the Temple of Scholars heavily guarded. The Old Man was right, they would all be snuffed out as quick as a candle if seen. Elle found herself growing nervous the closer they moved. Butterflies were flapping their wings furiously in the pit of her stomach. Their guide was an expert at moving in the shadows, she wondered how he could see. Soon, they found themselves moving away from the Temple and away from the danger that came with it. Finally, they reached a strong oak door imbedded in a rough wall of rock. Elle spotted many tens of similar doors nearby and hoped no-one would appear from them. A click of a lock, the oak door was open, and they were ushered quickly and quietly inside. Elle had not realised how cold she was until the warmth of the fire embraced her. They had walked into a cosy room, that she presumed was the Scholar’s living quarters. Cosy armchairs relaxed in front of the simmering fire, bookcases lined the walls of the room, thousands of books nestled on their shelves. A large table was positioned against a stone wall, burdened heavily with parchment, more books and odd bits of strange coloured stone. Two oak doors led off the room to the Scholar’s bedchamber and private quarters. Groaning slightly, the Old Man locked the door and sidled into the room, and slowly lowered himself into his favourite armchair before the fire, breathing heavily.‘Your friend is dying.’ He said sadly, cutting in before they could speak.‘Can you help her?’ Ayda asked desperately.‘I can’t,’ He replied, ‘But I know someone who may be able to help.’ He took his walking stick in his hand and knocked three times on the cracked slate hearth surrounding the fire. The sound echoed slightly. Elle watched expectantly, waiting for something to happen. She could sense the anticipation of her friends around her, all staring patiently at the old slate. Maybe he was crazy? Elle thought. What was he hoping to happen? Suddenly, the sound of grinding stone on slate filled her ears, as the fragmented slate lifted away from the hearth, revealing a dark stairwell leading down. Elle’s curiosity got the better of her as she moved closer and peered in through the gap in the floor. The gap was small enough to let one person through at a time. In the dark, the stone stairs leading into the dark belly beneath them looked difficult, they would need to be careful. Elle looked back at the Old Man who had not moved at all.‘Go on, Princess.’ He nodded at her.‘How can we trust you? We don’t know you!’ Ayda cautioned Elle.‘Right now, your friend doesn’t have time for me to explain. If you want to save her, move.’Could she trust him? She thought, her confidence in him wavering slightly. Was she about to walk willingly into a trap? A prison that she had just watched open? The Old Man had said they could help Syren, was this a risk worth taking? The faded appearance of her red headed friend pushed her on. Waiting until Ayda was by her side, she carefully stepped on to the stone and began her descent. The steps were uneven, she lost her footing early on. Putting her hands out either side to touch the wall as a guide, she made her way lower and lower. She wondered if it would be safer for her to crawl down on her bottom but decided against it. Her friends had followed her down, she could hear their boots as they too, slipped on the deceiving ground. It wasn’t as dark as she thought, small candles were flickering in their sconce, casting dim, golden light to dance warmly along the cold walls. Finally, she reached the bottom. She gasped. She wanted to run far, far away from this place, she shimmied backwards into her sister, who groaned and moved her aside.‘What’s wrong with you?’ Ayda asked, looking down at Elle’s expression of shock.‘This-this place!’ Elle stammered, the rest of the group piled into the room, Syren being carried along by Karl and Theo. Brielle could not take her eyes from the large domed room. Every inch of stone was covered in glistening crystal, everywhere her eyes scanned, from the floors, to the ceiling, the crystals glittered like stars against the dark stone. It tugged at her deep inside, it looked so familiar…‘Bring her in, bring her in!’ A young female voice sounded rushed. Brielle jumped as she saw a young woman, about the same age as Ayda emerge from an archway at the end of the dome, and frantically gesture to them. Karl and Theo quickly carried Syren as gently as possible across the empty dome and through the archway. The other’s followed quickly. Elle was left alone. They did not understand the significance of this room, she thought. To her, it felt, like a dark version of home. Like she had been here before.‘This room is familiar to you?’ The Old Man was at her side, she had been caught in her reverie and had not heard him emerge.‘Yes…’ Brielle responded quietly, ‘It’s the Ritual Chamber back at home.’She had remembered why it caused her such fear, such a deep ache. To her, the Ritual Chamber of her home had caused all the misery that followed, she wished she had never stepped foot in the chamber. She had been such a fool to be so excited about her summons, and she had lost everything in doing so.‘Look closer at the crystals.’ The Old Man said simply. Reluctantly, Elle got closer to the walls beside her. The crystals were an inch or so wide, jagged and dotted in the stonework across the walls, floors and ceiling. They were also black. A deep, beautiful ebony. Her breath hitched. They were not the same. She remembered the crystals in the Castle Chamber as being clear as water.‘What are they?’ She asked, feeling more at ease in the mysterious dome.‘They are my most important discovery,’ The Old Man said seriously, ‘soon I will tell you of them, but for now, promise me, that you will not use magic unless instructed by myself.’Elle’s curiosity piqued. His most important discovery?‘Why are you helping us?’ Elle asked,‘Your Father made me promise, besides, I would have anyway. You are far too important.’She opened her mouth to press the Scholar for more, until she saw Ayda and Sir Rakel beckon her enthusiastically from the archway. Remembering Syren, she ran to them without looking back. Ayda looked at her happily. ‘You are not going to believe this!’ Ayda beamed. Brielle felt elated at her sister’s excitement, what had they found? The Princess followed her sister into the room beyond the archway, it was like the last, black crystals adorned every inch of the smaller, domed room. Much like the living room they had left, this room also had books lining the walls and scrolls and parchment along desks and shelves. Amazement shook her body as she saw what was happening in the centre. Her friends had gathered around a table, their faces were pale, and their eyes were wide as they contemplated what they were seeing. Elle felt the hair on her arms and neck stand up, as shock crawled over her body like a spider.Syren was led peacefully on the table, but she was glowing. Brielle could not move, she knew that glow. She had been practising her magic and seen that white light so many times. Magic was flowing through Syren! The white light was so bright that Elle nearly missed the hands resting upon Syren’s body. Following the arms, squinting against the gleam, she noticed that the hands belonged to the young lady who had called them. Her eyes hurt, the glare from the light was strong in the dark, underground rooms, she raised her hand to shield herself. Ayda immediately noticed.‘What’s wrong?’ She asked worried, placing a hand on her shoulder.‘The light – it’s too bright!’ Elle whispered.‘I knew she was going to heal her, but I didn’t know she had magic!’ Ayda exclaimed wide-eyed. The light pierced her eyes for mere moments before she adjusted. Finally, able to focus without wincing through the pain, Elle moved closer to examine what was happening. Elle watched as beads of light emerged from the outstretched hands of the healer and disappeared into Syren’s body, Elle could see that much magic was being used as Syren’s body glowed. The healer’s eyes were scrunched shut in concentration and only opened once the glow had begun to dim. She had finished. Elle looked at Syren’s face expectantly. The magical light dimmed to nothing as the healer pulled away from her body. Syren still did not move.‘What happened? Didn’t it work?’ Elle asked timidly, waiting for Syren’s eyes to burst open.‘The Magic can only do so much, little one, her body now needs to do the rest.’ The lady replied.‘What did you do?’ Ayda asked, approaching cautiously, afraid of the unknown.‘She had internal injuries that caused her to gradually lose a lot of blood, much longer and she would be lost.’‘Now what?’‘Now we wait for her body to recuperate and replenish itself. All her injuries are healed,’ The healer explained, ‘Now, if you would be so kind, please settle her in that room behind you.’ She gestured to the small arch leading off the dome. Karl and Theo obligingly carried her into the room. Elle felt a rush of relief, that was mirrored on Ayda’s face, Syren was going to be OK. The healer put her hand around Elle’s shoulder and embraced her gently. It was a warm gesture, and one that made Elle instantly love the young lady who had saved her friend.‘Come, little one, we have much to discuss.’ She said.‘You’re a mage?’ Elle blurted out excitedly. Brielle was awed by the display of power she had seen and felt a bond with this mage. She had felt so alone before, shouldering the responsibility of magic that no one understood, now she had a mage as an ally. Someone who could teach her and understand her.‘I am.’ The woman replied kindly. Elle, Ayda, Niall and Sir Rakel were following her back up the stone steps, towards the warm living room above. Elle had so many questions, she couldn’t wait to reach their destination.‘Can you teach me?’‘Partly…’‘Can I heal like you?’‘Maybe…’‘Are we alone?’The questions poured from her like water from a tankard. The healer barely had time to answer before she was hit by the next onslaught of questions. Finally, they reached the living room where the Old Scholar was waiting, comfortable back in his arm chair. He gestured for them to sit around him as the Healer slid the slate hearth back into place.‘I see you have met my friend Nhima,’ He smiled. Elle was fascinated by them both, how the Scholar could smile at her, knowing where she was sat when he was blind was beyond her.‘Yes, she’s a Mage, like me.’ Elle explained breathlessly. The Old Scholar chuckled.‘Who are you?’ Ayda asked him bluntly.‘I am Scholar Byran, or just Byran now really…’ He muttered to himself, fidgeting with his robes.‘You’re not a Scholar anymore?’ Sir Rakel asked, confused.‘Oh no, too old my dear boy.’ Byran muttered. Elle saw Nhima’s eyes flicker to Byran’s and guessed something was being left unspoken. Brielle continued.‘Are you the Scholar who taught our Father to use his magic?’ She asked, anticipating the answer she was sure to come.‘I am. The King at the time – your Grandfather – begged me, I accepted.’‘Can you teach me?’‘I promised your Father that I would, but I fear I will be of less use to you.’ Byran sighed.‘You were not blind when you mentored the King.’ Sir Rakel pointed out.‘Who are you?’ Byran asked the Old Knight, his face faltering slightly.‘Sir Rakel, Chief Protector to the King and Head of the Elven Army.’ Sir Rakel responded proudly.‘Yes, yes, I remember you, the King was very fond of you.’ Byran nodded. At this, Ayda shot Rakel an evil glare as he looked guiltily to the floor. Elle knew he was going to regret his actions until the day he died.‘If I am to teach you, there are rules you must follow.’ Byran began, Elle sat up eagerly.‘You are not allowed to use magic, anywhere other than below. The training rooms below were designed for your Father and this is the only place you can use magic.’‘Why?’ Elle asked.‘The Scholars here are not your friends. If they hear, sense or see your magic, there is nothing we can do to stop them. The Legion is strong here and they will hunt you down,’ Nhima replied softly.‘The rules also apply to me, for they are no friend of mine.”‘They want to kill you too?’ Ayda asked her.‘Me, her, any Mage. Their aim is the extinction of Magic.’‘So, we are not alone?’ Elle whispered, excited and scared at the same time.‘No, little one, there are many, many more of us, they just don’t know it.’ Nhima smiled sadly.‘What do you mean?’ Elle’s brows were furrowed, confused.‘You have been to the Ritual, Princess, tell us what you saw.’ Byran asked her kindly. Brielle felt the gaze of the other’s lock onto her. She retold her story. She told them all the Elves that had joined her in the room, told them of the blue mark on their wrists, all with differing brightness, told them of the orbs of light she now knew to be magic, and of the crystals on the wall and the similarity with the ones in the basement training rooms. Relaying it all back to her companions, aloud, sparked answers inside her head.‘The other Elves are Mages!’ Elle announced, shocked. Byran nodded.‘Let me explain what I have only guessed at over the years,’ Byran began, ‘I have long suspected that Magic is still as abundant as before. First your Father came to me, then Nhima and now yourself, there are never three discrepancies. I then turned to the Ritual. The Chamber itself was a much-researched development. I have long suspected, following your Father’s descriptions, that this was a way of controlling magic. It was only then, with your description, Princess that I can confirm my suspicions.’‘What – why?’ Elle stammered, perplexed.‘You can see the flow of magic. You see it as a light, and you described seeing the light leaving the Elves around you and travelling together to the centre of the Chamber. I believe the Elders are channelling the magic to themselves.’‘You mean the Elders are stealing magic?’ Ayda asked, trying to keep up. ‘How can they possibly do that?’ Niall asked.‘With these Crystals.’ Byran held one clear crystal and one ebony crystal in his hand.‘What do they do?’ Elle asked, intrigued.‘The clear ones absorb magic. The ebony stones block it. This is my belief.’‘How can we prove it?’ Elle asked.‘We will experiment, when the time is right. Now we have you here, you can watch the magic.’ Nhima smiled.‘Why are they stealing magic?’ Sir Rakel asked.‘Control,’ Ayda cut in, ‘Magic destroyed our lands and destroyed our peoples, they want it eradicated and to be the only ones with power.’‘I believe that is partly the reason.’ Byran nodded.‘How so?’ Ayda shot him a look.‘Magic is all but extinct. No one feels its presence anymore, so why steal it unless you have something to gain? I haven’t figured this part out yet.’ Something didn’t add up to Brielle. There were thousands of Mages in her Kingdom, yet the Elders only wanted her dead? They even left her Father untouched over the years before the uprising.‘Why do they want me dead?’ The question left her lips without permission. She hated how scared she sounded.‘The Elders target anyone who uses their magic or whose magic is a threat.’ Nhima responded simply.‘I’d never used mine, nor am I threat.’ Elle replied.‘And Father used magic, and they never targeted him.’ Ayda added.‘Your Father hid his Magic how I taught him, they knew he had magic, but could never trace him using it. That is why it is essential not to use your magic unless you are in the training rooms. They can trace you here.’‘But why-’‘That’s enough for today, you are all tired and need rest. Tomorrow we will begin your training Princess. Get some sleep.’ The Scholar dismissed, and without another word, he locked himself into his private chambers and left them with Nhima. Elle was annoyed, she had some answers, but nothing definite. The Old Scholar had many ideas and explanations but no proof, and he still had not answered why the Elders want her – a child elf – dead when so many Mages are alive! She allowed herself to be ushered back down the stairs towards the training halls again, lost in her thoughts and confusion, she realised she was being led to a corridor with many doors, Nhima showed her friends to their own room, and then finally came to Elle, opening the door she walked inside. The room was small and brightly lit, sconces lined the walls. This room was also covered head to toe in the black crystals. Elle thought he must have spent a long time creating these training rooms. The room contained a small bed and wooden wardrobe, opening it, she was relieved to see a selection of simple linen clothes, including a nightdress.‘Your sister is in the room opposite you, if you need her,’ Nhima advised, ‘I am next door.’Elle nodded appreciatively as Nhima closed the door quietly behind her. She was exhausted. Flinging herself down on the bed she stifled a yawn. The bed was comfortable, much more comfortable than the bed of leaves Ayda had been creating for her every night. It pained her to remember the last night she spent in her grand bed when Amie would brush out her hair before sleep. How far away those nights were, they didn’t seem real to her anymore, a distant dream perhaps. Her head was whirling with thoughts, plans, ideas and worries, she didn’t think sleep would come to her. She tried to imagine an empty box, peaceful, dark and quiet so she could rest. Like a beacon, however, her thoughts would come smashing back to her through the artificial serenity. She decided her dirty clothes may not be helping. Throwing them to the floor she shimmied into her clean, plain nightdress. It was nothing fancy or decorative like back at the Castle, but it was fresh. The scent and softness alone relaxed her. Lying back under the sheets, she felt herself ease a little, and finally, she slept.",

The Pearl White Mountains of her home felt unimpressive, compared to the mass of sharp grey rock glaring down on her. She was an insect gazing up at the tower of jagged rock, she strained her head as far back as she could, taking in the sheer size of the monstrous formation, and felt herself stumble backwards, dizzied by its formidable magnitude. She knew that no one could ever have climbed these Mountains, they were too deadly and there was no route through or over. The Three Thorns Mountains was named for its three peaks, that she knew from old maps she had been shown, but their reach extended deep into the sky. Sounds of wonder came from her companions, knowing she wasn’t the only one seeing it for the first time, she took a moment to examine her friend’s reactions. Ayda was stood transfixed, a great image of the Thorns reflected in her eye. Niall and Theo were gazing in wonder, mouths agape, for the first time ever, they were silent, even Sir Rakel was intimidated by the colossus. Snow covered the teeth of the mountains and thick white clouds buried the summits. Elle’s eye was drawn to a glint in the mountain face to the right of her. Like a magpie, she searched for the source of the shimmer. An artery had burst from deep within the Mountains, and water had broken free of its restraints through a crack in its skin. Now that she had noticed the great waterfall smashing its route through the rock, she could hear the song of flowing water beneath the deafening sound of tumbling water. This waterfall had given birth to the Myr River, the lifeblood of the mountain had been dividing the Elven and Human Race for centuries. Examining the vast Mountains, Brielle noticed there was a worrying lack of something. The Temple.‘Where is it?’ She asked Sir Rakel, he shook his head.‘I don’t know, your Father always said to follow the river, I’ve never seen it.’ He explained, as confused as she was. Elle sighed, now what? Ayda had snapped out of her stupor.‘I knew it,’ She snarled, pushing Sir Rakel away from Brielle, ‘You’ve lured us here, into the open, for no reason! Traitor!’‘Stop it.’ Elle said weakly, without conviction. She felt disappointed. She felt lost. What was the plan now, they had no idea where the Temple was!‘No Elle, you can’t stick up for him! We’re in the wide open, we’ve run out of supplies, Syren has been unconscious for days and we know we’re being hunted. He’s lured us into a trap!’ Ayda snapped aggressively. Elle had nothing to say. She felt cold to the core, Sir Rakel had been a light in her dark world with his plans and his insight, but he had let her down. She feared the worst, desperation crashed over her like a wave. Had Ayda been right all along, was Sir Rakel really her enemy? The Old Protector looked abashed, shocked and hurt. Ayda was stood facing him anger burning through her, searing great holes in him, he looked lost.‘Look! Someone’s there!’ Niall announced to the group. Elle spun around to where Niall was pointing. Sure enough, a small figure in the distance could be seen walking quickly along the river towards the mountains. It seemed he had been nestled behind a cluster of trees at the base of the fall. Elle watched with interest as he quickly and confidently climbed over rocks and disappeared into the mountain.‘Where was he going?’ Elle wondered.‘Maybe there’s an entrance there?’ Sir Rakel said eagerly, looking hopefully at Elle.‘Or maybe this is part of your trap!’ Ayda smacked him brutally.‘Ayda!’ Elle wailed.‘If I had wanted her dead she’d be dead by now!’ Sir Rakel said, his tone fierce, ‘This Temple is our only lead and I want to find it as much as you!’ Elle had already made up her mind. She had to find the Temple. She was tired of the bickering and the arguments. Leaving the others behind, she briskly set off towards the rocks. Theo and Karl followed her dutifully. The ground beneath her feet was unstable and uneven. Patches of grass could be seen dotted closer to the river but mostly the ground before her was layered with rock and dust, she felt as though she was trekking across the roots of the Mountains. She heard the wheels of Syren’s transport crunch behind her and the clicking of hooves against rock and guessed her team was with her now. Looking back over her shoulder she could see the outline of the Forest beyond the wastes that had been her shelter for a long time. She was leaving the luscious, fertile lands for a dry, chalk-like future.‘Are you sure about this Princess?’ She heard Niall say as he came alongside her.‘I need to find the Temple, it’s worth the risk.’ She nodded. She couldn’t believe how much she was hoping for Sir Rakel to be right. She wanted more than anything to find a pathway, or a door, anything that might lead her to the Temple. The Temple held her answers, she was so sure of that and she had become so dependent on finding it and finding herself. She was so close, she could feel it. It had been a long road, a long journey to get here, they had been through so much. She could hardly remember the carefree elf she had been, she could barely remember the faces of her friends back at the Stone Castle. All she knew now, was that she had a fight coming, and Elle couldn’t afford to be a scared child anymore. The mountain was drawing close, Elle had to steady herself to stop herself breaking into a run. Those at the front began climbing. Walls of rock framed the base of the mountain, Niall helped Elle over the bigger ones, with Sir Rakel close behind, ready to catch her. Finally, they reached the rock where the man had disappeared behind.‘Wait, Princess!’ Sir Rakel demanded, as Elle began the final climb. Elle faltered and looked at him.‘It should be me to go first…’ Sir Rakel began.‘Like hell!’ Ayda sneered, catching up with them, ‘Like we’d give you a chance to announce us!’‘I failed your Father, I will not fail you now, please,’ Sir Rakel ignored Ayda, his eyes bored into Elle’s determined glare, ‘I have brought you this far.’ Elle nodded and stepped aside to clear the rock for the Protectors ascent. With a few grunts and clinks of his golden armour, the old Elf hauled himself over with his strength and disappeared. Ayda glared darkly at Elle. Brielle knew she had angered her sister. At every turn she and Ayda had disagreed. Ayda had been furious at the group’s acceptance of the ‘traitor’ and could not forgive him for the loss of their Father. Elle had more hope than that. She had hope that this Protector, who she had once loved as an Uncle, was still that same Elf now. The little Princess had not been ready to abandon him, she had lost too much already. The litter that contained Syren had been hidden behind rocks with the remaining horses, too cumbersome to heave through the maze of rock that they had struggled to climb over. Karl and Theo had volunteered to stay with her. Elle feared for Syren, they were running out of time, Elle guessed her friend would not hold on for much longer, she was surprised she had made it this far. It felt like they waited an age, Ayda had started pacing, glaring at the spot Sir Rakel had last been stood as if he were still there. A few times she had mentioned to the others about running, and leaving him, but Elle was adamant she was staying, this was their best hope, she was sure of it. Finally, the crunch of grit reached her, and she knew he had returned, his old face appeared over the rock and he was beaming.“Come quickly!” He gestured, disappearing once more. With that each of them clambered over the rock, Elle as the smallest, stumbling slightly on the climb. Ayda’s eyes were cautious, wandering and scanning every inch of their surroundings, her hand never leaving her sword. Sliding down the face of the rock, Elle hit the ground hard, grit scraping the skin on her palms. A father like hand lifted her from her fall, Sir Rakel was smiling from ear to ear. His eyes moved to a point behind her and she followed his gaze, noticing Niall and Ayda were also following closely. A cloaked man stood in the entrance of a shadowy cavern, a jagged mouth in the wall had been concealed by the rocks they had climbed. His face was masked by the dark shadow cast by his hooded cloak, which was shabby, torn and frayed at the hem. Elle wondered if this was the man they had followed, but realised, as he moved closer, that this man was much older and very frail. His hand shook violently on his stick as he approached them. He drew close and he lowered his hood. Elle bit back a gasp. The man was old, and he was human. His eyes were a pure and brilliant white, staring unmoving a spot behind her head. He was blind she realised. His head was full of thick grey hair and his beard framed his broad chin.‘Princess Brielle, Princess Ayda. Follow me.’ He said. Elle was soothed by his voice. If she had known her Grandfather, this is how she would like him to sound. His voice was warm, and full of timeless wisdom. Ayda stepped before her before Elle could follow the Old Man into the cavern.‘You’re just going to trust him?’ Ayda asked, incredulously.‘Yes.’ Elle said simply.‘How can you trust so blindly, after all that has been?!’‘Stay if you wish. I’m going in.’ Elle shrugged. She was tired of fighting this battle. The Old Man was frail, blind and warm hearted, and she found she trusted him like an old friend. Shrugging, Elle gestured to Sir Rakel who took the lead, and followed him. Brielle guessed that Ayda and Niall had followed as she heard their footsteps echo through the cavern behind her. It wasn’t as dark as she had feared, the walls of the cavern had been chiselled smooth and circular holes had been carved out of the walls to let the light in. It was more of a stone corridor than a mountainous tavern. Stone masons had taken great care with this walkway, the walls were smooth, the floors were level and the windows were perfectly positioned and sized to let in light and be unnoticeable from the outside. Elle marvelled at the skill of the Old Man, being blind did not seem to hinder him in the slightest as he traced his stick along the base of the walls. Although they had caught up with him quickly and were eager to reach their destination, they patiently followed him through the cavern. Karl and Theo could be heard hauling Syren’s stretcher behind them, much to Elle’s relief. She could not suffer to lose any of her friends. On they walked, reaching an incline, their walk became slower still as they followed the corridor higher up the mountain, still surrounded by neatly cut rock. As they climbed higher with the gradient, a rush of water grew louder and louder, resonating through the cavern, until they could no longer hear their footsteps echoing around them. Ahead of them, a dim light was visible as the exit of the corridor approached. Leaving the tunnel, Elle marvelled in amazement at the beauty flowing through the mountain. They had reached the top of the waterfall. To her right she had a view across Myrliar and the Human lands. She could see the stretches of forests and even the wastes they had not long left. The trail of the River Myr meandered into the distance. A large pool of water lay before her, each droplet of fluid waiting to breach the mountain and plunge into the river below. To the left, Elle could see several smaller streams that fed the pool and, in the distance, was a sight that took her breath away. The Temple. The streams reflected light far in to the cave, beyond that, torches were blazing lighting up the most amazing building she had ever seen. The Old Man had stopped near the exit of the corridor, he was smiling.‘Welcome to the Temple of Scholars,’ He said, chuckling, ‘I remember the first time I laid my eyes on it too, it is something you have to see to believe - and even then, you may have to pinch yourself.’ That was certainly true, Elle thought. She could never have guessed from outside that this could have been built within the Mountain itself. The torches lit up a magnificent collection of interconnected domes carved from the Mountain. The Temple, although not taller than the Stone Castle once was, it was wider and in the dark, when lit purely by torches, had a magical feel to it. Bridges of rock were formed over the flowing streams and she could make out lit paths in the distance far from their position.‘Is this the only route in?’ Sir Rakel asked the Old Man, looking around.‘No, this is the back entrance, very few know of it, and even fewer can climb the other side,’ The Old Man chuckled again, ‘There are two main entrances, much grander, but both watched. This is the best way to keep you unnoticed.’ The Old Man gestured for them to follow and led them along the glistening pool of water.‘Are we not going into the Temple?’ Ayda asked from behind.‘Good heavens no, you’d be killed on sight.’‘Because the Scholars work with the Elders?’ Elle asked.‘Not all, but most.’ The Old Scholar sighed,‘Why don’t you?’‘Because I know something they don’t.’ he signalled for them to keep quiet. In the cave, sound travelled easier and quicker through the air, and along the water. They had to remain unnoticed. Their guide led them closer to the Temple, keeping to the shadows of the rocky cave. Elle wondered how the Scholar knew where the shadows were but said nothing as she followed closely. The Temple grew more impressive the closer they moved, the domes were smooth, and Elle could make out intricate gold detail patterned along the walls of each building. Elaborate decorative archways marked entrances and huge golden doors emitted a yellow glow from the flickering torches. Closer still Elle could see the reflection of the lights in the streams flowing around the domes, the floors nearer to the Temple were painted gold with gemstones sunk into the floor like mosaics. She had never seen such a sight of splendour. Red cloaks could be spotted prowling the exterior. The Legion had the Temple of Scholars heavily guarded. The Old Man was right, they would all be snuffed out as quick as a candle if seen. Elle found herself growing nervous the closer they moved. Butterflies were flapping their wings furiously in the pit of her stomach. Their guide was an expert at moving in the shadows, she wondered how he could see. Soon, they found themselves moving away from the Temple and away from the danger that came with it. Finally, they reached a strong oak door imbedded in a rough wall of rock. Elle spotted many tens of similar doors nearby and hoped no-one would appear from them. A click of a lock, the oak door was open, and they were ushered quickly and quietly inside. Elle had not realised how cold she was until the warmth of the fire embraced her. They had walked into a cosy room, that she presumed was the Scholar’s living quarters. Cosy armchairs relaxed in front of the simmering fire, bookcases lined the walls of the room, thousands of books nestled on their shelves. A large table was positioned against a stone wall, burdened heavily with parchment, more books and odd bits of strange coloured stone. Two oak doors led off the room to the Scholar’s bedchamber and private quarters. Groaning slightly, the Old Man locked the door and sidled into the room, and slowly lowered himself into his favourite armchair before the fire, breathing heavily.‘Your friend is dying.’ He said sadly, cutting in before they could speak.‘Can you help her?’ Ayda asked desperately.‘I can’t,’ He replied, ‘But I know someone who may be able to help.’ He took his walking stick in his hand and knocked three times on the cracked slate hearth surrounding the fire. The sound echoed slightly. Elle watched expectantly, waiting for something to happen. She could sense the anticipation of her friends around her, all staring patiently at the old slate. Maybe he was crazy? Elle thought. What was he hoping to happen? Suddenly, the sound of grinding stone on slate filled her ears, as the fragmented slate lifted away from the hearth, revealing a dark stairwell leading down. Elle’s curiosity got the better of her as she moved closer and peered in through the gap in the floor. The gap was small enough to let one person through at a time. In the dark, the stone stairs leading into the dark belly beneath them looked difficult, they would need to be careful. Elle looked back at the Old Man who had not moved at all.‘Go on, Princess.’ He nodded at her.‘How can we trust you? We don’t know you!’ Ayda cautioned Elle.‘Right now, your friend doesn’t have time for me to explain. If you want to save her, move.’Could she trust him? She thought, her confidence in him wavering slightly. Was she about to walk willingly into a trap? A prison that she had just watched open? The Old Man had said they could help Syren, was this a risk worth taking? The faded appearance of her red headed friend pushed her on. Waiting until Ayda was by her side, she carefully stepped on to the stone and began her descent. The steps were uneven, she lost her footing early on. Putting her hands out either side to touch the wall as a guide, she made her way lower and lower. She wondered if it would be safer for her to crawl down on her bottom but decided against it. Her friends had followed her down, she could hear their boots as they too, slipped on the deceiving ground. It wasn’t as dark as she thought, small candles were flickering in their sconce, casting dim, golden light to dance warmly along the cold walls. Finally, she reached the bottom. She gasped. She wanted to run far, far away from this place, she shimmied backwards into her sister, who groaned and moved her aside.‘What’s wrong with you?’ Ayda asked, looking down at Elle’s expression of shock.‘This-this place!’ Elle stammered, the rest of the group piled into the room, Syren being carried along by Karl and Theo. Brielle could not take her eyes from the large domed room. Every inch of stone was covered in glistening crystal, everywhere her eyes scanned, from the floors, to the ceiling, the crystals glittered like stars against the dark stone. It tugged at her deep inside, it looked so familiar…‘Bring her in, bring her in!’ A young female voice sounded rushed. Brielle jumped as she saw a young woman, about the same age as Ayda emerge from an archway at the end of the dome, and frantically gesture to them. Karl and Theo quickly carried Syren as gently as possible across the empty dome and through the archway. The other’s followed quickly. Elle was left alone. They did not understand the significance of this room, she thought. To her, it felt, like a dark version of home. Like she had been here before.‘This room is familiar to you?’ The Old Man was at her side, she had been caught in her reverie and had not heard him emerge.‘Yes…’ Brielle responded quietly, ‘It’s the Ritual Chamber back at home.’She had remembered why it caused her such fear, such a deep ache. To her, the Ritual Chamber of her home had caused all the misery that followed, she wished she had never stepped foot in the chamber. She had been such a fool to be so excited about her summons, and she had lost everything in doing so.‘Look closer at the crystals.’ The Old Man said simply. Reluctantly, Elle got closer to the walls beside her. The crystals were an inch or so wide, jagged and dotted in the stonework across the walls, floors and ceiling. They were also black. A deep, beautiful ebony. Her breath hitched. They were not the same. She remembered the crystals in the Castle Chamber as being clear as water.‘What are they?’ She asked, feeling more at ease in the mysterious dome.‘They are my most important discovery,’ The Old Man said seriously, ‘soon I will tell you of them, but for now, promise me, that you will not use magic unless instructed by myself.’Elle’s curiosity piqued. His most important discovery?‘Why are you helping us?’ Elle asked,‘Your Father made me promise, besides, I would have anyway. You are far too important.’She opened her mouth to press the Scholar for more, until she saw Ayda and Sir Rakel beckon her enthusiastically from the archway. Remembering Syren, she ran to them without looking back. Ayda looked at her happily. ‘You are not going to believe this!’ Ayda beamed. Brielle felt elated at her sister’s excitement, what had they found? The Princess followed her sister into the room beyond the archway, it was like the last, black crystals adorned every inch of the smaller, domed room. Much like the living room they had left, this room also had books lining the walls and scrolls and parchment along desks and shelves. Amazement shook her body as she saw what was happening in the centre. Her friends had gathered around a table, their faces were pale, and their eyes were wide as they contemplated what they were seeing. Elle felt the hair on her arms and neck stand up, as shock crawled over her body like a spider.Syren was led peacefully on the table, but she was glowing. Brielle could not move, she knew that glow. She had been practising her magic and seen that white light so many times. Magic was flowing through Syren! The white light was so bright that Elle nearly missed the hands resting upon Syren’s body. Following the arms, squinting against the gleam, she noticed that the hands belonged to the young lady who had called them. Her eyes hurt, the glare from the light was strong in the dark, underground rooms, she raised her hand to shield herself. Ayda immediately noticed.‘What’s wrong?’ She asked worried, placing a hand on her shoulder.‘The light – it’s too bright!’ Elle whispered.‘I knew she was going to heal her, but I didn’t know she had magic!’ Ayda exclaimed wide-eyed. The light pierced her eyes for mere moments before she adjusted. Finally, able to focus without wincing through the pain, Elle moved closer to examine what was happening. Elle watched as beads of light emerged from the outstretched hands of the healer and disappeared into Syren’s body, Elle could see that much magic was being used as Syren’s body glowed. The healer’s eyes were scrunched shut in concentration and only opened once the glow had begun to dim. She had finished. Elle looked at Syren’s face expectantly. The magical light dimmed to nothing as the healer pulled away from her body. Syren still did not move.‘What happened? Didn’t it work?’ Elle asked timidly, waiting for Syren’s eyes to burst open.‘The Magic can only do so much, little one, her body now needs to do the rest.’ The lady replied.‘What did you do?’ Ayda asked, approaching cautiously, afraid of the unknown.‘She had internal injuries that caused her to gradually lose a lot of blood, much longer and she would be lost.’‘Now what?’‘Now we wait for her body to recuperate and replenish itself. All her injuries are healed,’ The healer explained, ‘Now, if you would be so kind, please settle her in that room behind you.’ She gestured to the small arch leading off the dome. Karl and Theo obligingly carried her into the room. Elle felt a rush of relief, that was mirrored on Ayda’s face, Syren was going to be OK. The healer put her hand around Elle’s shoulder and embraced her gently. It was a warm gesture, and one that made Elle instantly love the young lady who had saved her friend.‘Come, little one, we have much to discuss.’ She said.‘You’re a mage?’ Elle blurted out excitedly. Brielle was awed by the display of power she had seen and felt a bond with this mage. She had felt so alone before, shouldering the responsibility of magic that no one understood, now she had a mage as an ally. Someone who could teach her and understand her.‘I am.’ The woman replied kindly. Elle, Ayda, Niall and Sir Rakel were following her back up the stone steps, towards the warm living room above. Elle had so many questions, she couldn’t wait to reach their destination.‘Can you teach me?’‘Partly…’‘Can I heal like you?’‘Maybe…’‘Are we alone?’The questions poured from her like water from a tankard. The healer barely had time to answer before she was hit by the next onslaught of questions. Finally, they reached the living room where the Old Scholar was waiting, comfortable back in his arm chair. He gestured for them to sit around him as the Healer slid the slate hearth back into place.‘I see you have met my friend Nhima,’ He smiled. Elle was fascinated by them both, how the Scholar could smile at her, knowing where she was sat when he was blind was beyond her.‘Yes, she’s a Mage, like me.’ Elle explained breathlessly. The Old Scholar chuckled.‘Who are you?’ Ayda asked him bluntly.‘I am Scholar Byran, or just Byran now really…’ He muttered to himself, fidgeting with his robes.‘You’re not a Scholar anymore?’ Sir Rakel asked, confused.‘Oh no, too old my dear boy.’ Byran muttered. Elle saw Nhima’s eyes flicker to Byran’s and guessed something was being left unspoken. Brielle continued.‘Are you the Scholar who taught our Father to use his magic?’ She asked, anticipating the answer she was sure to come.‘I am. The King at the time – your Grandfather – begged me, I accepted.’‘Can you teach me?’‘I promised your Father that I would, but I fear I will be of less use to you.’ Byran sighed.‘You were not blind when you mentored the King.’ Sir Rakel pointed out.‘Who are you?’ Byran asked the Old Knight, his face faltering slightly.‘Sir Rakel, Chief Protector to the King and Head of the Elven Army.’ Sir Rakel responded proudly.‘Yes, yes, I remember you, the King was very fond of you.’ Byran nodded. At this, Ayda shot Rakel an evil glare as he looked guiltily to the floor. Elle knew he was going to regret his actions until the day he died.‘If I am to teach you, there are rules you must follow.’ Byran began, Elle sat up eagerly.‘You are not allowed to use magic, anywhere other than below. The training rooms below were designed for your Father and this is the only place you can use magic.’‘Why?’ Elle asked.‘The Scholars here are not your friends. If they hear, sense or see your magic, there is nothing we can do to stop them. The Legion is strong here and they will hunt you down,’ Nhima replied softly.‘The rules also apply to me, for they are no friend of mine.”‘They want to kill you too?’ Ayda asked her.‘Me, her, any Mage. Their aim is the extinction of Magic.’‘So, we are not alone?’ Elle whispered, excited and scared at the same time.‘No, little one, there are many, many more of us, they just don’t know it.’ Nhima smiled sadly.‘What do you mean?’ Elle’s brows were furrowed, confused.‘You have been to the Ritual, Princess, tell us what you saw.’ Byran asked her kindly. Brielle felt the gaze of the other’s lock onto her. She retold her story. She told them all the Elves that had joined her in the room, told them of the blue mark on their wrists, all with differing brightness, told them of the orbs of light she now knew to be magic, and of the crystals on the wall and the similarity with the ones in the basement training rooms. Relaying it all back to her companions, aloud, sparked answers inside her head.‘The other Elves are Mages!’ Elle announced, shocked. Byran nodded.‘Let me explain what I have only guessed at over the years,’ Byran began, ‘I have long suspected that Magic is still as abundant as before. First your Father came to me, then Nhima and now yourself, there are never three discrepancies. I then turned to the Ritual. The Chamber itself was a much-researched development. I have long suspected, following your Father’s descriptions, that this was a way of controlling magic. It was only then, with your description, Princess that I can confirm my suspicions.’‘What – why?’ Elle stammered, perplexed.‘You can see the flow of magic. You see it as a light, and you described seeing the light leaving the Elves around you and travelling together to the centre of the Chamber. I believe the Elders are channelling the magic to themselves.’‘You mean the Elders are stealing magic?’ Ayda asked, trying to keep up. ‘How can they possibly do that?’ Niall asked.‘With these Crystals.’ Byran held one clear crystal and one ebony crystal in his hand.‘What do they do?’ Elle asked, intrigued.‘The clear ones absorb magic. The ebony stones block it. This is my belief.’‘How can we prove it?’ Elle asked.‘We will experiment, when the time is right. Now we have you here, you can watch the magic.’ Nhima smiled.‘Why are they stealing magic?’ Sir Rakel asked.‘Control,’ Ayda cut in, ‘Magic destroyed our lands and destroyed our peoples, they want it eradicated and to be the only ones with power.’‘I believe that is partly the reason.’ Byran nodded.‘How so?’ Ayda shot him a look.‘Magic is all but extinct. No one feels its presence anymore, so why steal it unless you have something to gain? I haven’t figured this part out yet.’ Something didn’t add up to Brielle. There were thousands of Mages in her Kingdom, yet the Elders only wanted her dead? They even left her Father untouched over the years before the uprising.‘Why do they want me dead?’ The question left her lips without permission. She hated how scared she sounded.‘The Elders target anyone who uses their magic or whose magic is a threat.’ Nhima responded simply.‘I’d never used mine, nor am I threat.’ Elle replied.‘And Father used magic, and they never targeted him.’ Ayda added.‘Your Father hid his Magic how I taught him, they knew he had magic, but could never trace him using it. That is why it is essential not to use your magic unless you are in the training rooms. They can trace you here.’‘But why-’‘That’s enough for today, you are all tired and need rest. Tomorrow we will begin your training Princess. Get some sleep.’ The Scholar dismissed, and without another word, he locked himself into his private chambers and left them with Nhima. Elle was annoyed, she had some answers, but nothing definite. The Old Scholar had many ideas and explanations but no proof, and he still had not answered why the Elders want her – a child elf – dead when so many Mages are alive! She allowed herself to be ushered back down the stairs towards the training halls again, lost in her thoughts and confusion, she realised she was being led to a corridor with many doors, Nhima showed her friends to their own room, and then finally came to Elle, opening the door she walked inside. The room was small and brightly lit, sconces lined the walls. This room was also covered head to toe in the black crystals. Elle thought he must have spent a long time creating these training rooms. The room contained a small bed and wooden wardrobe, opening it, she was relieved to see a selection of simple linen clothes, including a nightdress.‘Your sister is in the room opposite you, if you need her,’ Nhima advised, ‘I am next door.’Elle nodded appreciatively as Nhima closed the door quietly behind her. She was exhausted. Flinging herself down on the bed she stifled a yawn. The bed was comfortable, much more comfortable than the bed of leaves Ayda had been creating for her every night. It pained her to remember the last night she spent in her grand bed when Amie would brush out her hair before sleep. How far away those nights were, they didn’t seem real to her anymore, a distant dream perhaps. Her head was whirling with thoughts, plans, ideas and worries, she didn’t think sleep would come to her. She tried to imagine an empty box, peaceful, dark and quiet so she could rest. Like a beacon, however, her thoughts would come smashing back to her through the artificial serenity. She decided her dirty clothes may not be helping. Throwing them to the floor she shimmied into her clean, plain nightdress. It was nothing fancy or decorative like back at the Castle, but it was fresh. The scent and softness alone relaxed her. Lying back under the sheets, she felt herself ease a little, and finally, she slept.",

      "content": "15 -AYDADamn him, Ayda thought, as she rolled over again in her bed. She hated being wrong, but she hated being pointless even more. Looking up at the dark stone ceiling she let out a long sigh. What was she to do now? Sir Rakel had gotten them this far, and Elle was to begin her training. Ayda felt frustrated. Her tiny, little sister was more powerful than her and no longer needed her protection. She was also annoyed with herself. She hadn’t trusted Sir Rakel and now she wasn’t sure, he had led them safely here, and Elle was now going to learn to control her magic, which was in everyone’s interest. Something just didn’t feel right. They were now stuck in the middle of a hornet’s nest, there was no escape, so if there was a long-term plan, that Rakel had cooked up with the Legion, they were ready to be served. She couldn’t lower her guard, that would be expected. Sitting up, she gave up on the notion of sleep. Too much had happened, and the soft comfort of the bed was too much for her aching bones. Redressing, she decided to poke around their new home. Pulling open her door slowly, she crept out. She considered waking Elle up for the adventure, but she’d guessed Elle was resting, besides she quite fancied the silence of being alone. She tiptoed along the stone corridor, trying her best not to wake up any of her friends. Reaching the end, she stopped as she heard hushed voices coming from the connecting room.‘Can you not see how pointless this is?’‘How much longer do we have to stay?’It was Karl and Theo, and she guessed they were talking with Niall. Although their voices were hushed, there was a distinct tone that she had not heard from them for a while.‘We promised we’d help them.’ Niall’s voice replied quietly. Ayda felt a rush of warmth spread through her at his words. For some reason, he had put hers and her sisters needs ahead of Theo and Karl, and they had finally had enough. He seemed adamant that he needed to stay, and despite herself she wanted him to. He had been a nuisance to her at the beginning, he had brought back memories she had preferred locked away. Ayda could not deny, her comfort at him being around. Their great defender. He had defended them as best he could against an enemy he never understood, and he had never faltered. Even when faced with leaving Syren, who had hated them so intensely, he had chosen to be the bigger person. She had never appreciated him before.‘There’s nothing left for us, what more can we do? This isn’t our war.’ Karl urged. They continued their heated conversation in hushed tones for a little while longer, Theo and Karl adamant they wanted to return home to the Hole and their Fiends. Ayda stood awkwardly by the door, until finally she spoke up.‘If you guys want to head home, no-one will hold it against you,’ She said kindly appearing in front of them, ‘you have done so much for us, we cannot ask for anymore.’ The three of them were sat around the old wooden table in the centre of the room. Theo and Karl looked up at her when she spoke, relief across their faces.‘It’s not that we don’t want to stay, Ayda, but you don’t need us anymore and we’ve been gone too long as it is.’ Theo replied warmly.‘I understand, I won’t stop you.’ Ayda nodded. Theo and Karl stood happily, content that they at least have Ayda’s support. Walking towards the corridor she had emerged from, Theo patted her on the shoulder as he passed. Ayda smiled at him, but her eyes stayed on Niall. He hadn’t looked at her once. He was looking down at the table, unmoving. Ayda heard the snap of the door as Theo and Karl returned to their rooms and moved closer to Niall.‘You want us to go?’ Niall whispered quietly, still not looking at her.‘What? No, I mean, it’s what you want isn’t it?’ Ayda replied taken aback. Niall finally looked her in the eye. There was an emotion she had not seen before. It was longing. He was holding something back from her, and his expression was hurt and tired.‘I don’t want to leave you, not again. But I have to.’ Niall started. There was a softness in his eye she hadn’t seen before.‘I understand, where will you go?’ Ayda asked gently.‘All these stories, and lies, I need to find the truth about my own people.’ Niall replied.‘About magic?’‘Yes, I want to know why it’s been concealed from us. I was doubtful and rude to you before. But after seeing Elle with my own eyes, I can only apologise.’‘I understand, the world is deceitful. Everything we both believed in was a lie.’ Ayda said quietly. Niall reached across and touched her hand. They were both silent. Ayda looked at the man in front of her. He still had the eyes of the boy she had known before, they were softer. The journey had changed him. He had been so carefree before, but now, he seemed to bear the weight of the world.‘What will you do?’‘I have learnt a lot about your world, there is something you should know of mine,’ Niall started, ‘It has been rumoured that our King has a Spirit God, an advisor.’‘A Spirit God?’ Ayda repeated.‘Yes, no-one has ever seen him, but it is told he possesses magic. No one has ever believed this as no one believed in magic…’‘But now you do. Is that where you will go, to your King?’ Ayda finished.‘Yes, alone, it seems, I have asked too much of my friends.’ Ayda felt slightly uncomfortable as she realised he was still holding her hand. The warmth from his fingertips rose steadily up her arm. She felt their connection change. He was no longer just a haunted past. He was a future, and someone she would greatly miss.‘You have never moved on, have you?’ Niall asked her. Ayda knew what he meant, and strangely, she felt ready to talk.‘I couldn’t. I made it my life’s work to protect my family. I failed.’‘You haven’t. Elle is here safe because of you.’‘But she doesn’t need me.’‘She needs you more than you realise. She wants to protect you too.’‘When will you go?’‘Soon. It will be a long ride.’ Ayda withdrew her hand from his grasp to yawn. It had been a long journey; the tiredness was now creeping up on her. Taking that as his cue, Niall stood.‘Goodnight Princess,’ He smiled, dropping into a deep mocking bow as normal. This time it made her smile, a smile she couldn’t remove from her face as she watched him walk away. Ayda sidled into the seat he had vacated. It was still warm. He was leaving, she thought. Finally, she had pushed him away, and the irony of that was she did not want him to, she wanted him to stay. She wanted all of them to stay. After all the heartache and suffering, after the blood they had shed next to each other, they felt like family. How she felt and what she said never worked well as a team. Ayda felt numb, everyone she cared about was disappearing, maybe she should be the one to leave, before Elle was next. Anger and regret filled her completely. She hated to admit it, but she would miss him. Ayda would miss Niall.",

      "content": "16 - ELLEAll was silent. No flowing river, no scurrying animals or singing birds could be heard. It was silent. She was the only living thing in the world. She waited for the gentle caress of the morning breeze, or the early sun to warm her face, but nothing came. Breathing in she expected the scent of morning dew to soothe her, but the air was cold and stagnant. Where was she? Slowly, she opened her eyes, her vision was blurry, so she blinked the laziness of sleep from them. The room was dim, and dark. There were no windows, she could not tell if it was morning. The walls twinkled in the dimming light of the candles and for a moment she thought she was sleeping with the stars at night. Then she remembered. She was deep in the Mountain, in the cold, lifeless mountain. Her friends were somewhere nearby, silent in their rest. Her bed was warm and comfortable, she felt safe in its embrace. Elle found she missed the freedom of the forest. She had woken warmer and more comfortable than before, yet looking around, she felt like a prisoner. She felt a smile spread across her lips as she remembered why butterflies had taken residence within her – she was going to learn magic today. Jumping up with bubbling enthusiasm she ripped open the wardrobe and pulled on a clean plain dress. Not pausing, she flew out of the door and tore down the corridor. Hearing voices ahead she slowed. Niall and Ayda. Standing in a doorway they were talking in serious voices, it looked uncomfortable, Elle thought. Niall’s expression was grim, it turned her gut to ice, it was not an expression she had seen on his face before. She tried to back away from view – but too late.‘Elle!’ Ayda greeted her, happy to walk away from Niall towards her sister. Elle pushed down a grin as she saw that her sister had also changed her clothes. She looked misplaced in her fresh linens compared to her Patrol Gear and clearly felt uncomfortable, although she had still managed to fix her blade to her waist.‘I don’t think you need that here, we’re safe.’ Elle stifled a giggle, pointing to Ayda’s sword.‘There’s Scholars and the Legion mere feet away from us, we are not safe.’ Ayda pointed out, pulling Elle into a squeeze.‘Why do you have to do that?’ Niall hissed at her, approaching, his expression still dark. ‘We’re safer here than we have been in a long time. Don’t listen to her Princess.’ Elle shook her head fiercely. Nothing was dampening her spirits, today, finally she was going to learn all about her magic. She was one step closer to her Mother, and that was a feeling that wouldn’t fade. Ayda seemed to glimpse the excitement in her little sister’s face.‘Breakfast first, you can’t go magicking around on an empty stomach.’ She teased, leading her sister on. Niall followed closely behind them.‘How are you feeling?’ Ayda asked her little sister.‘Excited, after I’ve learned magic, we can go home. We can see Mother.’ Elle said happily. In her happiness, Brielle did not notice the way Ayda’s mouth open and closed as Niall nudged her slyly.‘Magic may take some time to learn –’ Ayda began.‘I know, but I’m ready.” Elle dismissed. Elle had not noticed the night before how much of labyrinth the underground rooms were. The space was vast, she had no idea how long the construction must have taken. There were several bedrooms next to hers, presumably the same size as hers, where her friends slept. Following the corridor led to the smaller domed room where she had watched Nhima heal Syren the night before. Finally, the large dome, the training dome, connected them to the stairwell which led to the Scholars’ Chambers. To her surprise, they did not follow the staircase up. Ayda led her to another door, a door that she had not noticed before, she could hear laughter and talking voices. As Ayda opened the door for her, Elle squealed as she took in the sight before her. Her friends were all sat around the table, oddly dressed in their clean linens and all content and comfortable in each other’s presence. At the head of the table was the Scholar, laughing at a story Sir Rakel was telling of his childhood with her Father. Nhima was serving up a small portion of porridge into a stone bowl and beaming at her. Their faces all shone at her. She smiled back at them happily, until one smile caught her by surprise. Furthest from her, between Nhima and the Scholar sat a young woman, weakened and pale, but nonetheless sat, quite proudly. Her red hair had been washed and she too was sporting clean clothes. Syren. Elle sprinted faster than ever before and jumped into her arms, tears threatening to flow from her eyes.‘Careful, little one!’ Nhima exclaimed. Elle pulled away from Syren and turned to the young woman. To everyone’s glee, Elle wrapped her arms around her waist.‘Thank you so much!’ Elle wailed in happiness. Nhima blushed and softly patted the curls on the Princess’s head. Elle sat herself down between Nhima and Syren and glowed. Her heart felt as though it was on fire. She had everything. Her friends had fought for her to get here. She loved them and would do anything for them. To see Syren well, happy and sat with her dearest companions filled her with joy. Sir Rakel had been accepted it seemed, Ayda was being far more pleasant to him now that trust had been restored. Elle’s eyes locked with Ayda’s. A deep sadness was silhouetted in her eyes. Ayda had suffered much to get them here. Her over protective, caring, fierce sister had done everything in her power to keep her safe and had fought the odds to get to her. Brielle knew she had much to worry about and much to fear. The most powerful Mages on earth were hunting her, and their army was mere feet away, but right now, when she saw how much she had to lose and how many people had fought loyally beside her, she could not bring herself to fear, or to hate. When her heart weighed so heavily with adoration. The morning was one of light and laughter, the team were lifted to tremendous heights with their success. When Scholar Byran suggested they begin training, the other’s insisted on joining. Brielle could sense their eagerness and agreed, somewhat nervously. Moments later, they were positioned in the large training hall. The black crystals were gleaming brilliantly across the walls.‘First off, let’s see if my theory works.’ The ex-scholar said. He placed one clear crystal on his palm outstretched, Nhima and Elle closely surrounding it.‘Nhima is going to expel some of her Magic into it, Elle I need you to watch it closely.’ He instructed. Elle nodded. At once, a faint trickle of tiny glowing orbs spread from Nhima’s hand towards the crystal. Watching closely, Elle ascertained that the glow of magic moved through the physical boundary of the crystal and lay deep within, leaving the crystal seemingly glowing on its own. Elle explained what she saw. Next, Byran instructed the same, but this time surrounded the white crystals in rough, ebony stones, like the ones on the walls. Firstly, Nhima attempted to pour her magic into the black stones. The light could not penetrate the shell of the stones and merely rested against them unable to go any further. Then she tried to move the stones, as before the glow surrounded the stones but no matter how she tried, they could not be moved. They were unaffected by her magic.‘What does this mean?’ Elle asked.‘I believed the Ebony Stones blocked magic, and as you can see they are not affected by it either,’ The Scholar explained. ‘What you have just described to me, proves that the flow of magic cannot pass the Ebony Stones, but it can be absorbed into the crystals.’ Elle nodded. ‘What we do not know for sure, is if they block the appearance of magic.’ He scratched his head.‘Why is that important? Can all Mages sense magic?’ Ayda asked.‘Not all, but the ones you want to avoid.’ Nhima smiled.‘Can you see it?’ Elle asked Nhima. Nhima shook her head.‘There is only one Mage who can see magic, and that is yourself. But some Mages can sense it in the air, especially strong magic.’ The Scholar explained.‘If Elle goes to your quarters, do you think she could see it?’ Niall suggested cleverly. The rooms below the Scholars Quarters were imbedded with Ebony Stones, the idea was to conceal the magic within.‘It’s worth a shot.’ Elle nodded, already on her way.‘Wait! Up there you are vulnerable with just a wooden door to protect you – be careful!’ The Scholar raised his hand. Elle nodded. Knowing Ayda would follow, she proceeded up the stone stairs. Ouch! She cursed as her head hit the ceiling. The slate hearth was in place, blocking their exit. Ayda heaved with all her strength but could not shift it, it was too heavy.‘Use your magic,’ A female voice called in her mind. Elle jumped, startling Ayda, who looked at her questioningly. That voice! Elle remembered the voice well for it had haunted her dreams since the Ritual.‘Who are you?’ Elle thought back to the disembodied voice in her mind. No answer. Elle huffed, frustrated at being ignored. Elle focussed on the task at hand, the others were waiting. The hearth was heavy and going to take a lot of effort. Elle pushed her magic outwards as she had learnt before, the light spread from her outstretched hands and formed itself around the section of slate above her. She willed it to move, saw her desire clear in her mind. It would not budge. Maybe more magic, she thought. She threw more magic from within her into the stone. It shook slightly with the impact. Once more she concentrated on moving the stone, finally, slowly it lifted. Shock shook through her as she felt the weight of it strain her bones, shaking with effort, she raised the hearth just high enough for them to scramble out and then dropped it back into place behind them. The sound was louder than she had hoped.‘You were shaking, are you ok?’ Ayda asked, concerned.‘It felt heavy. I wasn’t expecting it to.’ Elle whispered, allowing herself time to recover. Sitting down in the armchairs, they waited. Elle looked for any signs of glowing magic from around her. There were none. No lights whatsoever. She disappeared into all the adjoining rooms but could not see any signs of magic from below. She was satisfied that the Scholars assumptions were correct. The Ebony Stones did block all magic, including its signs. It made her untraceable. Deciding they had examined the outside long enough, they opted to move back to the others and share their findings. Elle poured magic back into the stone to open it, and thankfully, found it easier than before. Exhausted from the effort they returned to their friends.‘So, does this mean you are right?’ Ayda asked once they had advised that Elle could not sense the magic.‘It means the Elders cannot sense Brielle and Nhima’s magic down here, which means they are safe.’ The Scholar explained.‘The Elders can sense magic too?” Elle asked, dumbfounded. Did she share a skill with the Elders? Was this why they wanted her dead?‘The Elders can sense all magic, but not see it as you do.’ Nhima continued calmly, ‘The strongest mages are sensed and marked, receiving “summons” and once in the Chamber, the patterns glow to show the Elders the remaining strength of each Mage before the magic is taken. They can then judge the power left in the Chamber.’‘They use these crystals to drain and store the magic they take from the unknowing Mages, but why they do it, I do not know.’ The Scholar finished. Elle remembered the summons on her hand. The light had glowed dimly on the night of the summons, the same as the other Elves lucky enough to be selected. They had all looked at it as a mark of importance, a mark to wear with pride and honour at being one of the few selected. Elle looked down at her hand in disgust. She remembered during the Ritual the mark lighting up on every Elf in the room, she had been startled and blinded by the brightness of her own in comparison with every other. Her parents had also been surprised, she remembered. The mark on her hand was not a medal of honour, not a mark of respect. It was a tag. A tag that had betrayed her strength to the Elders and had marked her only for death. She despised it. She thought back at the marvel of bright spheres, now knowing that she was witnessing the Ritual, witnessing the Elder’s stealing the Elves magic.‘How did you learn all of this?’ Sir Rakel asked. The Scholar sighed.‘I was studying, in the Temple Library. I came across an old book. It was buried deep in the shelves, it hadn’t been touched for centuries. The pages were crumbling to dust. I took it and carefully rewrote it. What I read shocked me. We Scholars are aware of Magic. We know it exists, albeit rarely. But we never knew it could be stolen.’ The room was deafly quiet as everyone clung onto his words. Elle was holding her breath, staying as silent as possible, waiting for the old Scholar to continue.‘I found a record, a diary entry of a Student Mage from before the Elder’s war. He was shocked to learn that he had the talent. He had tried to teach his friends the skill, but it could not be taught. He believed it was a skill that a Mage had to be born with. I read on, intrigued by the Student’s desire for study. He had learned how to store magic into stones. I never got further than that before the Legion and the other Scholars learned of my studies. The Prime Scholar banished me from the Temple and blinded me as punishment. They burned my works and experiments. I was exiled.’‘Oh my...’ Elle felt pity in her heart, this Old Man had been through so much.‘Do not pity me child, for I would be dead, if they had not underestimated what I had learned. All I had to do was fit the pieces together. The exile gave me the freedom to explore. When the King learned of an exiled Scholar not under the influence of the Elders, he was most keen to get in touch. Your Father and I spoke at length of the Ritual Chamber, and the stones within. Together we found them. But we could never be certain of our theory, until now.’ Elle’s mind was reeling. Her Father and this Scholar had worked together on this Theory? Her Father had known all of this? She felt dizzy, this was too much to take on all at once. Ayda looked as pale as she felt, confused.‘Why did Father not stop this, if he knew?’ Ayda asked quietly.‘He was not strong enough to threaten the Elders, we believed no one was.’‘Am I?’ Elle asked, hoping she wasn’t. The Elders felt so big and so mean, and she so small.‘One day you will be.’ The Scholar nodded knowingly.‘We realised your power at the same time the Elders did, we were too late.’‘How do you mean?’ Elle asked, confused. A female voice greeted through her mind. Elle stumbled, in shock she had not expected it. The same voice from the Ritual. Nhima was smiling at her.‘It was you?!’ Elle burst out, flabbergasted. The other’s looked between them in pure confusion.‘But – how – you don’t sound the same?!’ Elle continued.‘Our voices sound different in our minds because it is projection, we’re not actually speaking.’‘But – how!?’‘I can communicate through minds, as long as there is a clear channel.’ Nhima said.‘But you never reply!?’ Elle remarked.‘That’s because I can communicate – you can’t.’‘HOW?!’ Elle asked loudly, confused.‘It’s a skill of mine, I don’t use it often. It’s not often I get a clear channel.’ Nhima replied.‘A clear channel?’‘When you were in the Ritual Chamber your magic was linked to the stones, creating a kind of path between you and the destination. I sensed it and connected myself to it.’‘But that’s hundreds of miles! How did you sense that?!’‘Usually I can’t, but with the flow of that much magic from every mage in that chamber, you can just feel it if you concentrate enough. I didn’t have much time though before they traced me, or before my magic expired.’‘But why did you choose me?’‘I felt what the Elder’s saw in you the moment I connected with the channel and realised the danger we were both in. I pulled away in time, but you didn’t.’ Nhima ended apologetically.‘What did the Elder’s see?’ Elle asked frantically.‘You. The power you possess. I said before that they only hunt those who use their power or those who could threaten them. The extent of your power is so much greater than you realise.’ Elle felt sick. She stormed from the dome not wanting to hear anymore. Everything she had learned as a child was wrong. The weight of the truth bore down on her. She had been told that the Ritual was the highest honour to any Elf. The chance to speak to our Elders and to be bestowed knowledge was the greatest gift among her people, it was a lie. That was NEVER the intention. They were cattle, for farming. The Ritual had served as nothing but a harvest for the Elders to absorb all the power they could from their own people. Bile filled up in her stomach as anger took over. She had known they were wicked for wanting her dead, but to have killed and stolen and lied to her people for centuries about their own birth right revolted her. Her people didn’t know anything! They were all rich in magic and were blind to it! Lied to over centuries about magic being extinct following the war! The Elders she had once respected, worshipped and admired were suddenly everything she loathed in the world. They were the storms that drowned crops, the germs that caused disease and the fire that burned the forests. They were afraid of her, and she would show them fear. She would destroy the reign of the Elders and restore magic to her people.The knowledge that the history and tradition her people were so proud of, was a poison fed to them over years of ignorance, had ignited something inside her. Her actions were fuelled by hate, her desires energized by vengeance. She had been left alone, in the silence of her room for the remainder of the day. She guessed she was not the only one disturbed by the facts. She had seen the tears and disbelief in Sir Rakel’s usually iron eyes, the anger that burned from Syren and the despair and loss from her sister. Their history, in tatters. Even the humans could not understand this. They had been brought up away from all knowledge of magic, they didn’t even remember its existence. There were so many empty spaces in their understanding. Did humans still have magic unbeknownst to them? Or is it truly extinct in their race? She returned to the Training Dome to following morning alone. She practised on her own. She threw objects around the room with her magic, and accidentally destroyed some of the furniture in a blaze of temper. It was only when Ayda appeared, that she stopped.‘It’s a lot to take in, isn’t it?’ Ayda whispered quietly. Elle nodded in reply. At least Ayda had no magic, she hadn’t been stolen from or treated like a prized calf.‘Do you think Father knew?’ Ayda continued. Elle glared at her. Of course, Father hadn’t known. He would have put a stop to it. He would never have let her go in there to be unknowingly stripped of her magic.‘No.’ She replied harshly. Ayda winced, unused to hearing the malice in her good-hearted sister.‘He knew of magic. He used it, learned to hide it. He must have known something.’ Ayda sighed, more to herself than her sister.‘All those stories,’ Elle whispered sadly, ‘who even knows what’s true anymore.’‘Sir Rakel is heartbroken,’ Ayda replied, ‘He disappeared shortly after you and has barricaded his door. He won’t let me in.’‘Why would he let you in? You’ve been foul to him since you saw him!’ Elle let loose at her sister.‘I didn’t trust him! I was protecting you!’ Ayda replied, hurt and shocked.‘I don’t need you! I’m stronger than you – I’ve saved your life twice!’ Elle spat the venom from her mouth.‘This isn’t you – you’re shocked, and upset, I understand.’ Ayda bowed her head, and walked away, leaving Elle to her fury. No matter what Elle did, she knew Ayda would never turn on her, but the moment she disappeared, Elle stood flailing, drowning in her own guilt. She unleashed her magic once more. A small unlit candelabra flew from one wall to a cupboard at the far side of the dome, where a curse echoed. Niall emerged from his crouched hiding place.‘Niall?!’ Elle shouted, rushing over to see if he was hurt. He rubbed his arm as he stood. Why was he hiding? She thought.‘Sorry – sorry,’ He murmured, not looking her in the eye.‘What? Are you OK?’‘Fine, fine… just erm, dropped something.’ Elle knew this was a lie, she hadn’t seen him come in and both entrances were in view. He had been hiding.‘Why were you hiding?’‘Ah, um... well, you started to do your magic thing, erm, rather aggressively so I tried to stay out of your way.’ Niall replied, nervously.‘But why hide?’‘I was going to move,’ He began, ‘But then Ay – I dropped something.’ She knew what he was about to say even if he hadn’t said it. He hid because Ayda walked in. This was unlike Niall she thought. He was usually so carefree and ferocious, nothing could stand in the way of his confidence, and yet here he was cowering in front of a young girl. What had happened? She thought back to the heated conversation she walked in on yesterday between him and Ayda – had they argued? No, she thought, they were always bickering, and it never bothered him before. Or was it her? Had her power scared him?‘I’m sorry if I scared you.’ She said sadly.‘What? No!’ Niall seemed abashed, ‘I mean, it’s slightly unmanning to have a girl powerful enough to throw you and all that but it’s just... never mind. I’ll be fine.’ He thought better of his admittance, bowing mockingly to her as he had always done, and with a fleeting, secret smile, he retired and left her alone. Elle took a seat at the table near the edge of the room. The weight of centuries of deceit wore heavily on her shoulders. She slumped on to the table with her head in her hands. The group had been so strong and so happy, but the news of deceit had shaken them and shone light upon cracks. She had been so willing to trust everyone, had trusted the Elders and her parents, but the more she understood, the more she knew just how far the lies spread. The Elders had lied for centuries, her parents must have known, Ayda had been keeping secrets from her all her life, and yet Elle had laid her soul bare and loved each of them completely. Her heart was bruised, she was alone. Her old friend’s face wouldn’t appear in her memory anymore, the days of playing in the beautiful garden around her favourite tree were gone. Gone from her past and her future. She shook her head, she could not fall into despair. Yes, all she had believed was a lie. But she knew the truth, she knew she was powerful, and she knew that despite it all – she was not alone. There were thousands of Elves all with magic, in the dark about the power glowing brightly within them. There had to be a way to free them all! A young, dark woman walked through the door slowly. Her face was full of sorrow, not kindly as before. Nhima approached wearily and sat down opposite Elle.‘When I was younger than your age, I found my magic by accident,’ Nhima began, ‘My love was my garden. As a child I spent countless hours with my Grandmother, planting seeds and watering the flowers. One year, a snowstorm obliterated our fields, our crops were destroyed. My garden turned white with snow. I remember sitting in the cold snow alone, crying. We were poor, and we were hungry, there was not much to take pleasure from, my saplings and shrubs had all faded. I thought my eyes had been frozen shut by my tears, I had cried for so long. When I dared to open them, I found myself surrounded by a circle of snowdrops.’ Elle opened her mouth in awe. What a wonder that must have been! Nhima’s eyes shone with the memory, a memory that held such a magnificent hold on her heart.‘What did you do?’ Elle asked in an excited whisper.‘My Grandmother had been watching from a window, she ushered me inside so quickly. My Grandmother was a mage. A weak one, like me. She taught me to use what I have.’‘Weak?’ Elle asked.‘Yes, neither me nor my Grandmother were summoned, we were not strong enough to be of use to the Ritual.’‘What happened once you learned your magic?’‘Death,’ Nhima’s eyes glassed over, she was staring at something on the wall opposite. Perhaps shielding her eyes from the horrors, she had witnessed.‘I’m sor-’ Elle began, looking down.Nhima continued her story, ‘The Elders found out and the Legion came in the night. My Grandmother hid me well, they tortured her for my whereabouts. I had never seen magic used that way before… Grandmother taught me to defend, to grow and to heal. But my skill was not enough to save her. They burned our house down with me inside, they believed me to be dead. They searched for years after and never heard of me again.’ Elle shook her head and wiped the racing tears from her cheeks. Nhima had not looked at her once throughout her story. Her face was set like stone, she had grown into a strong and formidable Elf, Brielle thought, her Grandmother would be proud. Elle jumped slightly as Nhima grabbed her hands and looked her deep in the eye. Nhima’s eyes were dark brown, a sorrow was hidden by a passion so strong, Elle thought she saw flames flicker in their reflection.‘Together we can stop this Princess,’ She said, quietly and assertively, ‘I am sorry to tell you all this so soon, but we have never known the Elder’s so afraid. You must be prepared.’‘Yes,’ Elle felt as strongly as she, no more blood was going to be shed to hide magic, no more families destroyed, ‘Teach me.’Nhima’s story had resuscitated Brielle. She found herself more driven and controlled than ever before. There was no more hope of getting to her Mother. She realised there was a bigger picture. The thought of never seeing her Mother again crushed her heart, but if she could prevent other families from enduring the pain that she and Nhima had gone through, all in the name of magic, she knew her sacrifice would be worth it. That day, they had practised well into the night. Nhima had taught her how to shape her magic. Elle had perfected the art of moving small things with her magic, but now she saw that had been easy. Nhima and Byran had shown her how to visualise and feel exactly what she wanted to achieve and to morph her power into the living embodiment of her dream. It was tough work. They wanted her to start a fire. She had focussed and stared at the collection of wood for so long her eyes hurt but it wasn’t enough. She cast out her magic towards the wood, but it did nothing. The tiny orbs of light dissipated, wasted. Nhima explained she had to see the fire, smell it, hear it, and feel it. Elle could see the tiny flame in her mind, she could see it dancing with the smallest change in breeze, she could see growing, consuming the wood and the oxygen. She could hear it cracking the branches and sizzling the air. But it was not enough! She focussed on the feeling, she imagined the warmth enveloping her after a cold day, felt the sweat on her brow.‘All at once Princess – you can do it!’ Nhima encouraged. The effort was immense. Never had she realised how much concentration it took to do everything at once. It was hard to see, feel, hear and smell something that didn’t exist. Harder still to force her mind to believe it. Then she realised. Her mind was her limit. If her mind did not believe it, how on earth could it ever be! Pushing her magic out, the heat wrapped around her, she soaked up the warmth, willing her every bone to believe in its presence. She kept her eyes closed, she found it easier to visualise with her eyes closed. The crackle of the fire and smell of burning wood reached her senses. Believe it, believe it, she willed herself. Distantly, outside of herself she heard clapping and laughter. Forgetting herself, she opened her eyes to see what the fuss was about. Flames! A fire was roaring ferociously before her. Her friends had joined into witness and were laughing and celebrating her success. She felt a smile spread across her lips. She did it! Elle found herself bouncing up and down with the other’s in excitement. Her eagerness soon ebbed away as Nhima told her she now had to extinguish it. Elle didn’t understand, how could she do that.‘Let me show you.’ Nhima offered. Elle stood transfixed as she watched. Nhima’s power poured from within her. The magic surrounded the fire. Brielle watched as the lights changed form and created a clear veil around the fire. Slowly, the fire dimmed down, gradually receding to embers.‘How did you -?’ Elle asked, she hadn’t understood.‘The easiest way to put out a fire, is to eliminate what it needs most. Usually air.’ Byran explained. It clicked. Nhima had created a veil of power around the fire to smother it and starve it of air. Excitement rose within her. She could do that! Elle practised the same drill throughout the day. Lighting the fire and then extinguishing it. She started off slow, with her eyes closed, and sweat pouring from her as she plunged the deep depths of concentration. Eventually, it became more comfortable, and soon, it took mere seconds for a fire to spring into life and die. By the end of the day she was exhausted and relieved to crawl into her bed. Excitement and pride coursed through her veins; she did not believe she could ever drift off to sleep as each triumphant rekindling sparked into her mind clear as day. Eventually she drifted off, her dreams filled with her family and the magic she longed to perform to save them.",

      "content": "16 - ELLEAll was silent. No flowing river, no scurrying animals or singing birds could be heard. It was silent. She was the only living thing in the world. She waited for the gentle caress of the morning breeze, or the early sun to warm her face, but nothing came. Breathing in she expected the scent of morning dew to soothe her, but the air was cold and stagnant. Where was she? Slowly, she opened her eyes, her vision was blurry, so she blinked the laziness of sleep from them. The room was dim, and dark. There were no windows, she could not tell if it was morning. The walls twinkled in the dimming light of the candles and for a moment she thought she was sleeping with the stars at night. Then she remembered. She was deep in the Mountain, in the cold, lifeless mountain. Her friends were somewhere nearby, silent in their rest. Her bed was warm and comfortable, she felt safe in its embrace. Elle found she missed the freedom of the forest. She had woken warmer and more comfortable than before, yet looking around, she felt like a prisoner. She felt a smile spread across her lips as she remembered why butterflies had taken residence within her – she was going to learn magic today. Jumping up with bubbling enthusiasm she ripped open the wardrobe and pulled on a clean plain dress. Not pausing, she flew out of the door and tore down the corridor. Hearing voices ahead she slowed. Niall and Ayda. Standing in a doorway they were talking in serious voices, it looked uncomfortable, Elle thought. Niall’s expression was grim, it turned her gut to ice, it was not an expression she had seen on his face before. She tried to back away from view – but too late.‘Elle!’ Ayda greeted her, happy to walk away from Niall towards her sister. Elle pushed down a grin as she saw that her sister had also changed her clothes. She looked misplaced in her fresh linens compared to her Patrol Gear and clearly felt uncomfortable, although she had still managed to fix her blade to her waist.‘I don’t think you need that here, we’re safe.’ Elle stifled a giggle, pointing to Ayda’s sword.‘There’s Scholars and the Legion mere feet away from us, we are not safe.’ Ayda pointed out, pulling Elle into a squeeze.‘Why do you have to do that?’ Niall hissed at her, approaching, his expression still dark. ‘We’re safer here than we have been in a long time. Don’t listen to her Princess.’ Elle shook her head fiercely. Nothing was dampening her spirits, today, finally she was going to learn all about her magic. She was one step closer to her Mother, and that was a feeling that wouldn’t fade. Ayda seemed to glimpse the excitement in her little sister’s face.‘Breakfast first, you can’t go magicking around on an empty stomach.’ She teased, leading her sister on. Niall followed closely behind them.‘How are you feeling?’ Ayda asked her little sister.‘Excited, after I’ve learned magic, we can go home. We can see Mother.’ Elle said happily. In her happiness, Brielle did not notice the way Ayda’s mouth open and closed as Niall nudged her slyly.‘Magic may take some time to learn –’ Ayda began.‘I know, but I’m ready.” Elle dismissed. Elle had not noticed the night before how much of labyrinth the underground rooms were. The space was vast, she had no idea how long the construction must have taken. There were several bedrooms next to hers, presumably the same size as hers, where her friends slept. Following the corridor led to the smaller domed room where she had watched Nhima heal Syren the night before. Finally, the large dome, the training dome, connected them to the stairwell which led to the Scholars’ Chambers. To her surprise, they did not follow the staircase up. Ayda led her to another door, a door that she had not noticed before, she could hear laughter and talking voices. As Ayda opened the door for her, Elle squealed as she took in the sight before her. Her friends were all sat around the table, oddly dressed in their clean linens and all content and comfortable in each other’s presence. At the head of the table was the Scholar, laughing at a story Sir Rakel was telling of his childhood with her Father. Nhima was serving up a small portion of porridge into a stone bowl and beaming at her. Their faces all shone at her. She smiled back at them happily, until one smile caught her by surprise. Furthest from her, between Nhima and the Scholar sat a young woman, weakened and pale, but nonetheless sat, quite proudly. Her red hair had been washed and she too was sporting clean clothes. Syren. Elle sprinted faster than ever before and jumped into her arms, tears threatening to flow from her eyes.‘Careful, little one!’ Nhima exclaimed. Elle pulled away from Syren and turned to the young woman. To everyone’s glee, Elle wrapped her arms around her waist.‘Thank you so much!’ Elle wailed in happiness. Nhima blushed and softly patted the curls on the Princess’s head. Elle sat herself down between Nhima and Syren and glowed. Her heart felt as though it was on fire. She had everything. Her friends had fought for her to get here. She loved them and would do anything for them. To see Syren well, happy and sat with her dearest companions filled her with joy. Sir Rakel had been accepted it seemed, Ayda was being far more pleasant to him now that trust had been restored. Elle’s eyes locked with Ayda’s. A deep sadness was silhouetted in her eyes. Ayda had suffered much to get them here. Her over protective, caring, fierce sister had done everything in her power to keep her safe and had fought the odds to get to her. Brielle knew she had much to worry about and much to fear. The most powerful Mages on earth were hunting her, and their army was mere feet away, but right now, when she saw how much she had to lose and how many people had fought loyally beside her, she could not bring herself to fear, or to hate. When her heart weighed so heavily with adoration. The morning was one of light and laughter, the team were lifted to tremendous heights with their success. When Scholar Byran suggested they begin training, the other’s insisted on joining. Brielle could sense their eagerness and agreed, somewhat nervously. Moments later, they were positioned in the large training hall. The black crystals were gleaming brilliantly across the walls.‘First off, let’s see if my theory works.’ The ex-scholar said. He placed one clear crystal on his palm outstretched, Nhima and Elle closely surrounding it.‘Nhima is going to expel some of her Magic into it, Elle I need you to watch it closely.’ He instructed. Elle nodded. At once, a faint trickle of tiny glowing orbs spread from Nhima’s hand towards the crystal. Watching closely, Elle ascertained that the glow of magic moved through the physical boundary of the crystal and lay deep within, leaving the crystal seemingly glowing on its own. Elle explained what she saw. Next, Byran instructed the same, but this time surrounded the white crystals in rough, ebony stones, like the ones on the walls. Firstly, Nhima attempted to pour her magic into the black stones. The light could not penetrate the shell of the stones and merely rested against them unable to go any further. Then she tried to move the stones, as before the glow surrounded the stones but no matter how she tried, they could not be moved. They were unaffected by her magic.‘What does this mean?’ Elle asked.‘I believed the Ebony Stones blocked magic, and as you can see they are not affected by it either,’ The Scholar explained. ‘What you have just described to me, proves that the flow of magic cannot pass the Ebony Stones, but it can be absorbed into the crystals.’ Elle nodded. ‘What we do not know for sure, is if they block the appearance of magic.’ He scratched his head.‘Why is that important? Can all Mages sense magic?’ Ayda asked.‘Not all, but the ones you want to avoid.’ Nhima smiled.‘Can you see it?’ Elle asked Nhima. Nhima shook her head.‘There is only one Mage who can see magic, and that is yourself. But some Mages can sense it in the air, especially strong magic.’ The Scholar explained.‘If Elle goes to your quarters, do you think she could see it?’ Niall suggested cleverly. The rooms below the Scholars Quarters were imbedded with Ebony Stones, the idea was to conceal the magic within.‘It’s worth a shot.’ Elle nodded, already on her way.‘Wait! Up there you are vulnerable with just a wooden door to protect you – be careful!’ The Scholar raised his hand. Elle nodded. Knowing Ayda would follow, she proceeded up the stone stairs. Ouch! She cursed as her head hit the ceiling. The slate hearth was in place, blocking their exit. Ayda heaved with all her strength but could not shift it, it was too heavy.‘Use your magic,’ A female voice called in her mind. Elle jumped, startling Ayda, who looked at her questioningly. That voice! Elle remembered the voice well for it had haunted her dreams since the Ritual.‘Who are you?’ Elle thought back to the disembodied voice in her mind. No answer. Elle huffed, frustrated at being ignored. Elle focussed on the task at hand, the others were waiting. The hearth was heavy and going to take a lot of effort. Elle pushed her magic outwards as she had learnt before, the light spread from her outstretched hands and formed itself around the section of slate above her. She willed it to move, saw her desire clear in her mind. It would not budge. Maybe more magic, she thought. She threw more magic from within her into the stone. It shook slightly with the impact. Once more she concentrated on moving the stone, finally, slowly it lifted. Shock shook through her as she felt the weight of it strain her bones, shaking with effort, she raised the hearth just high enough for them to scramble out and then dropped it back into place behind them. The sound was louder than she had hoped.‘You were shaking, are you ok?’ Ayda asked, concerned.‘It felt heavy. I wasn’t expecting it to.’ Elle whispered, allowing herself time to recover. Sitting down in the armchairs, they waited. Elle looked for any signs of glowing magic from around her. There were none. No lights whatsoever. She disappeared into all the adjoining rooms but could not see any signs of magic from below. She was satisfied that the Scholars assumptions were correct. The Ebony Stones did block all magic, including its signs. It made her untraceable. Deciding they had examined the outside long enough, they opted to move back to the others and share their findings. Elle poured magic back into the stone to open it, and thankfully, found it easier than before. Exhausted from the effort they returned to their friends.‘So, does this mean you are right?’ Ayda asked once they had advised that Elle could not sense the magic.‘It means the Elders cannot sense Brielle and Nhima’s magic down here, which means they are safe.’ The Scholar explained.‘The Elders can sense magic too?” Elle asked, dumbfounded. Did she share a skill with the Elders? Was this why they wanted her dead?‘The Elders can sense all magic, but not see it as you do.’ Nhima continued calmly, ‘The strongest mages are sensed and marked, receiving “summons” and once in the Chamber, the patterns glow to show the Elders the remaining strength of each Mage before the magic is taken. They can then judge the power left in the Chamber.’‘They use these crystals to drain and store the magic they take from the unknowing Mages, but why they do it, I do not know.’ The Scholar finished. Elle remembered the summons on her hand. The light had glowed dimly on the night of the summons, the same as the other Elves lucky enough to be selected. They had all looked at it as a mark of importance, a mark to wear with pride and honour at being one of the few selected. Elle looked down at her hand in disgust. She remembered during the Ritual the mark lighting up on every Elf in the room, she had been startled and blinded by the brightness of her own in comparison with every other. Her parents had also been surprised, she remembered. The mark on her hand was not a medal of honour, not a mark of respect. It was a tag. A tag that had betrayed her strength to the Elders and had marked her only for death. She despised it. She thought back at the marvel of bright spheres, now knowing that she was witnessing the Ritual, witnessing the Elder’s stealing the Elves magic.‘How did you learn all of this?’ Sir Rakel asked. The Scholar sighed.‘I was studying, in the Temple Library. I came across an old book. It was buried deep in the shelves, it hadn’t been touched for centuries. The pages were crumbling to dust. I took it and carefully rewrote it. What I read shocked me. We Scholars are aware of Magic. We know it exists, albeit rarely. But we never knew it could be stolen.’ The room was deafly quiet as everyone clung onto his words. Elle was holding her breath, staying as silent as possible, waiting for the old Scholar to continue.‘I found a record, a diary entry of a Student Mage from before the Elder’s war. He was shocked to learn that he had the talent. He had tried to teach his friends the skill, but it could not be taught. He believed it was a skill that a Mage had to be born with. I read on, intrigued by the Student’s desire for study. He had learned how to store magic into stones. I never got further than that before the Legion and the other Scholars learned of my studies. The Prime Scholar banished me from the Temple and blinded me as punishment. They burned my works and experiments. I was exiled.’‘Oh my...’ Elle felt pity in her heart, this Old Man had been through so much.‘Do not pity me child, for I would be dead, if they had not underestimated what I had learned. All I had to do was fit the pieces together. The exile gave me the freedom to explore. When the King learned of an exiled Scholar not under the influence of the Elders, he was most keen to get in touch. Your Father and I spoke at length of the Ritual Chamber, and the stones within. Together we found them. But we could never be certain of our theory, until now.’ Elle’s mind was reeling. Her Father and this Scholar had worked together on this Theory? Her Father had known all of this? She felt dizzy, this was too much to take on all at once. Ayda looked as pale as she felt, confused.‘Why did Father not stop this, if he knew?’ Ayda asked quietly.‘He was not strong enough to threaten the Elders, we believed no one was.’‘Am I?’ Elle asked, hoping she wasn’t. The Elders felt so big and so mean, and she so small.‘One day you will be.’ The Scholar nodded knowingly.‘We realised your power at the same time the Elders did, we were too late.’‘How do you mean?’ Elle asked, confused. A female voice greeted through her mind. Elle stumbled, in shock she had not expected it. The same voice from the Ritual. Nhima was smiling at her.‘It was you?!’ Elle burst out, flabbergasted. The other’s looked between them in pure confusion.‘But – how – you don’t sound the same?!’ Elle continued.‘Our voices sound different in our minds because it is projection, we’re not actually speaking.’‘But – how!?’‘I can communicate through minds, as long as there is a clear channel.’ Nhima said.‘But you never reply!?’ Elle remarked.‘That’s because I can communicate – you can’t.’‘HOW?!’ Elle asked loudly, confused.‘It’s a skill of mine, I don’t use it often. It’s not often I get a clear channel.’ Nhima replied.‘A clear channel?’‘When you were in the Ritual Chamber your magic was linked to the stones, creating a kind of path between you and the destination. I sensed it and connected myself to it.’‘But that’s hundreds of miles! How did you sense that?!’‘Usually I can’t, but with the flow of that much magic from every mage in that chamber, you can just feel it if you concentrate enough. I didn’t have much time though before they traced me, or before my magic expired.’‘But why did you choose me?’‘I felt what the Elder’s saw in you the moment I connected with the channel and realised the danger we were both in. I pulled away in time, but you didn’t.’ Nhima ended apologetically.‘What did the Elder’s see?’ Elle asked frantically.‘You. The power you possess. I said before that they only hunt those who use their power or those who could threaten them. The extent of your power is so much greater than you realise.’ Elle felt sick. She stormed from the dome not wanting to hear anymore. Everything she had learned as a child was wrong. The weight of the truth bore down on her. She had been told that the Ritual was the highest honour to any Elf. The chance to speak to our Elders and to be bestowed knowledge was the greatest gift among her people, it was a lie. That was NEVER the intention. They were cattle, for farming. The Ritual had served as nothing but a harvest for the Elders to absorb all the power they could from their own people. Bile filled up in her stomach as anger took over. She had known they were wicked for wanting her dead, but to have killed and stolen and lied to her people for centuries about their own birth right revolted her. Her people didn’t know anything! They were all rich in magic and were blind to it! Lied to over centuries about magic being extinct following the war! The Elders she had once respected, worshipped and admired were suddenly everything she loathed in the world. They were the storms that drowned crops, the germs that caused disease and the fire that burned the forests. They were afraid of her, and she would show them fear. She would destroy the reign of the Elders and restore magic to her people.The knowledge that the history and tradition her people were so proud of, was a poison fed to them over years of ignorance, had ignited something inside her. Her actions were fuelled by hate, her desires energized by vengeance. She had been left alone, in the silence of her room for the remainder of the day. She guessed she was not the only one disturbed by the facts. She had seen the tears and disbelief in Sir Rakel’s usually iron eyes, the anger that burned from Syren and the despair and loss from her sister. Their history, in tatters. Even the humans could not understand this. They had been brought up away from all knowledge of magic, they didn’t even remember its existence. There were so many empty spaces in their understanding. Did humans still have magic unbeknownst to them? Or is it truly extinct in their race? She returned to the Training Dome to following morning alone. She practised on her own. She threw objects around the room with her magic, and accidentally destroyed some of the furniture in a blaze of temper. It was only when Ayda appeared, that she stopped.‘It’s a lot to take in, isn’t it?’ Ayda whispered quietly. Elle nodded in reply. At least Ayda had no magic, she hadn’t been stolen from or treated like a prized calf.‘Do you think Father knew?’ Ayda continued. Elle glared at her. Of course, Father hadn’t known. He would have put a stop to it. He would never have let her go in there to be unknowingly stripped of her magic.‘No.’ She replied harshly. Ayda winced, unused to hearing the malice in her good-hearted sister.‘He knew of magic. He used it, learned to hide it. He must have known something.’ Ayda sighed, more to herself than her sister.‘All those stories,’ Elle whispered sadly, ‘who even knows what’s true anymore.’‘Sir Rakel is heartbroken,’ Ayda replied, ‘He disappeared shortly after you and has barricaded his door. He won’t let me in.’‘Why would he let you in? You’ve been foul to him since you saw him!’ Elle let loose at her sister.‘I didn’t trust him! I was protecting you!’ Ayda replied, hurt and shocked.‘I don’t need you! I’m stronger than you – I’ve saved your life twice!’ Elle spat the venom from her mouth.‘This isn’t you – you’re shocked, and upset, I understand.’ Ayda bowed her head, and walked away, leaving Elle to her fury. No matter what Elle did, she knew Ayda would never turn on her, but the moment she disappeared, Elle stood flailing, drowning in her own guilt. She unleashed her magic once more. A small unlit candelabra flew from one wall to a cupboard at the far side of the dome, where a curse echoed. Niall emerged from his crouched hiding place.‘Niall?!’ Elle shouted, rushing over to see if he was hurt. He rubbed his arm as he stood. Why was he hiding? She thought.‘Sorry – sorry,’ He murmured, not looking her in the eye.‘What? Are you OK?’‘Fine, fine… just erm, dropped something.’ Elle knew this was a lie, she hadn’t seen him come in and both entrances were in view. He had been hiding.‘Why were you hiding?’‘Ah, um... well, you started to do your magic thing, erm, rather aggressively so I tried to stay out of your way.’ Niall replied, nervously.‘But why hide?’‘I was going to move,’ He began, ‘But then Ay – I dropped something.’ She knew what he was about to say even if he hadn’t said it. He hid because Ayda walked in. This was unlike Niall she thought. He was usually so carefree and ferocious, nothing could stand in the way of his confidence, and yet here he was cowering in front of a young girl. What had happened? She thought back to the heated conversation she walked in on yesterday between him and Ayda – had they argued? No, she thought, they were always bickering, and it never bothered him before. Or was it her? Had her power scared him?‘I’m sorry if I scared you.’ She said sadly.‘What? No!’ Niall seemed abashed, ‘I mean, it’s slightly unmanning to have a girl powerful enough to throw you and all that but it’s just... never mind. I’ll be fine.’ He thought better of his admittance, bowing mockingly to her as he had always done, and with a fleeting, secret smile, he retired and left her alone. Elle took a seat at the table near the edge of the room. The weight of centuries of deceit wore heavily on her shoulders. She slumped on to the table with her head in her hands. The group had been so strong and so happy, but the news of deceit had shaken them and shone light upon cracks. She had been so willing to trust everyone, had trusted the Elders and her parents, but the more she understood, the more she knew just how far the lies spread. The Elders had lied for centuries, her parents must have known, Ayda had been keeping secrets from her all her life, and yet Elle had laid her soul bare and loved each of them completely. Her heart was bruised, she was alone. Her old friend’s face wouldn’t appear in her memory anymore, the days of playing in the beautiful garden around her favourite tree were gone. Gone from her past and her future. She shook her head, she could not fall into despair. Yes, all she had believed was a lie. But she knew the truth, she knew she was powerful, and she knew that despite it all – she was not alone. There were thousands of Elves all with magic, in the dark about the power glowing brightly within them. There had to be a way to free them all! A young, dark woman walked through the door slowly. Her face was full of sorrow, not kindly as before. Nhima approached wearily and sat down opposite Elle.‘When I was younger than your age, I found my magic by accident,’ Nhima began, ‘My love was my garden. As a child I spent countless hours with my Grandmother, planting seeds and watering the flowers. One year, a snowstorm obliterated our fields, our crops were destroyed. My garden turned white with snow. I remember sitting in the cold snow alone, crying. We were poor, and we were hungry, there was not much to take pleasure from, my saplings and shrubs had all faded. I thought my eyes had been frozen shut by my tears, I had cried for so long. When I dared to open them, I found myself surrounded by a circle of snowdrops.’ Elle opened her mouth in awe. What a wonder that must have been! Nhima’s eyes shone with the memory, a memory that held such a magnificent hold on her heart.‘What did you do?’ Elle asked in an excited whisper.‘My Grandmother had been watching from a window, she ushered me inside so quickly. My Grandmother was a mage. A weak one, like me. She taught me to use what I have.’‘Weak?’ Elle asked.‘Yes, neither me nor my Grandmother were summoned, we were not strong enough to be of use to the Ritual.’‘What happened once you learned your magic?’‘Death,’ Nhima’s eyes glassed over, she was staring at something on the wall opposite. Perhaps shielding her eyes from the horrors, she had witnessed.‘I’m sor-’ Elle began, looking down.Nhima continued her story, ‘The Elders found out and the Legion came in the night. My Grandmother hid me well, they tortured her for my whereabouts. I had never seen magic used that way before… Grandmother taught me to defend, to grow and to heal. But my skill was not enough to save her. They burned our house down with me inside, they believed me to be dead. They searched for years after and never heard of me again.’ Elle shook her head and wiped the racing tears from her cheeks. Nhima had not looked at her once throughout her story. Her face was set like stone, she had grown into a strong and formidable Elf, Brielle thought, her Grandmother would be proud. Elle jumped slightly as Nhima grabbed her hands and looked her deep in the eye. Nhima’s eyes were dark brown, a sorrow was hidden by a passion so strong, Elle thought she saw flames flicker in their reflection.‘Together we can stop this Princess,’ She said, quietly and assertively, ‘I am sorry to tell you all this so soon, but we have never known the Elder’s so afraid. You must be prepared.’‘Yes,’ Elle felt as strongly as she, no more blood was going to be shed to hide magic, no more families destroyed, ‘Teach me.’Nhima’s story had resuscitated Brielle. She found herself more driven and controlled than ever before. There was no more hope of getting to her Mother. She realised there was a bigger picture. The thought of never seeing her Mother again crushed her heart, but if she could prevent other families from enduring the pain that she and Nhima had gone through, all in the name of magic, she knew her sacrifice would be worth it. That day, they had practised well into the night. Nhima had taught her how to shape her magic. Elle had perfected the art of moving small things with her magic, but now she saw that had been easy. Nhima and Byran had shown her how to visualise and feel exactly what she wanted to achieve and to morph her power into the living embodiment of her dream. It was tough work. They wanted her to start a fire. She had focussed and stared at the collection of wood for so long her eyes hurt but it wasn’t enough. She cast out her magic towards the wood, but it did nothing. The tiny orbs of light dissipated, wasted. Nhima explained she had to see the fire, smell it, hear it, and feel it. Elle could see the tiny flame in her mind, she could see it dancing with the smallest change in breeze, she could see growing, consuming the wood and the oxygen. She could hear it cracking the branches and sizzling the air. But it was not enough! She focussed on the feeling, she imagined the warmth enveloping her after a cold day, felt the sweat on her brow.‘All at once Princess – you can do it!’ Nhima encouraged. The effort was immense. Never had she realised how much concentration it took to do everything at once. It was hard to see, feel, hear and smell something that didn’t exist. Harder still to force her mind to believe it. Then she realised. Her mind was her limit. If her mind did not believe it, how on earth could it ever be! Pushing her magic out, the heat wrapped around her, she soaked up the warmth, willing her every bone to believe in its presence. She kept her eyes closed, she found it easier to visualise with her eyes closed. The crackle of the fire and smell of burning wood reached her senses. Believe it, believe it, she willed herself. Distantly, outside of herself she heard clapping and laughter. Forgetting herself, she opened her eyes to see what the fuss was about. Flames! A fire was roaring ferociously before her. Her friends had joined into witness and were laughing and celebrating her success. She felt a smile spread across her lips. She did it! Elle found herself bouncing up and down with the other’s in excitement. Her eagerness soon ebbed away as Nhima told her she now had to extinguish it. Elle didn’t understand, how could she do that.‘Let me show you.’ Nhima offered. Elle stood transfixed as she watched. Nhima’s power poured from within her. The magic surrounded the fire. Brielle watched as the lights changed form and created a clear veil around the fire. Slowly, the fire dimmed down, gradually receding to embers.‘How did you -?’ Elle asked, she hadn’t understood.‘The easiest way to put out a fire, is to eliminate what it needs most. Usually air.’ Byran explained. It clicked. Nhima had created a veil of power around the fire to smother it and starve it of air. Excitement rose within her. She could do that! Elle practised the same drill throughout the day. Lighting the fire and then extinguishing it. She started off slow, with her eyes closed, and sweat pouring from her as she plunged the deep depths of concentration. Eventually, it became more comfortable, and soon, it took mere seconds for a fire to spring into life and die. By the end of the day she was exhausted and relieved to crawl into her bed. Excitement and pride coursed through her veins; she did not believe she could ever drift off to sleep as each triumphant rekindling sparked into her mind clear as day. Eventually she drifted off, her dreams filled with her family and the magic she longed to perform to save them.",

      "content": "16 - ELLEAll was silent. No flowing river, no scurrying animals or singing birds could be heard. It was silent. She was the only living thing in the world. She waited for the gentle caress of the morning breeze, or the early sun to warm her face, but nothing came. Breathing in she expected the scent of morning dew to soothe her, but the air was cold and stagnant. Where was she? Slowly, she opened her eyes, her vision was blurry, so she blinked the laziness of sleep from them. The room was dim, and dark. There were no windows, she could not tell if it was morning. The walls twinkled in the dimming light of the candles and for a moment she thought she was sleeping with the stars at night. Then she remembered. She was deep in the Mountain, in the cold, lifeless mountain. Her friends were somewhere nearby, silent in their rest. Her bed was warm and comfortable, she felt safe in its embrace. Elle found she missed the freedom of the forest. She had woken warmer and more comfortable than before, yet looking around, she felt like a prisoner. She felt a smile spread across her lips as she remembered why butterflies had taken residence within her – she was going to learn magic today. Jumping up with bubbling enthusiasm she ripped open the wardrobe and pulled on a clean plain dress. Not pausing, she flew out of the door and tore down the corridor. Hearing voices ahead she slowed. Niall and Ayda. Standing in a doorway they were talking in serious voices, it looked uncomfortable, Elle thought. Niall’s expression was grim, it turned her gut to ice, it was not an expression she had seen on his face before. She tried to back away from view – but too late.‘Elle!’ Ayda greeted her, happy to walk away from Niall towards her sister. Elle pushed down a grin as she saw that her sister had also changed her clothes. She looked misplaced in her fresh linens compared to her Patrol Gear and clearly felt uncomfortable, although she had still managed to fix her blade to her waist.‘I don’t think you need that here, we’re safe.’ Elle stifled a giggle, pointing to Ayda’s sword.‘There’s Scholars and the Legion mere feet away from us, we are not safe.’ Ayda pointed out, pulling Elle into a squeeze.‘Why do you have to do that?’ Niall hissed at her, approaching, his expression still dark. ‘We’re safer here than we have been in a long time. Don’t listen to her Princess.’ Elle shook her head fiercely. Nothing was dampening her spirits, today, finally she was going to learn all about her magic. She was one step closer to her Mother, and that was a feeling that wouldn’t fade. Ayda seemed to glimpse the excitement in her little sister’s face.‘Breakfast first, you can’t go magicking around on an empty stomach.’ She teased, leading her sister on. Niall followed closely behind them.‘How are you feeling?’ Ayda asked her little sister.‘Excited, after I’ve learned magic, we can go home. We can see Mother.’ Elle said happily. In her happiness, Brielle did not notice the way Ayda’s mouth open and closed as Niall nudged her slyly.‘Magic may take some time to learn –’ Ayda began.‘I know, but I’m ready.” Elle dismissed. Elle had not noticed the night before how much of labyrinth the underground rooms were. The space was vast, she had no idea how long the construction must have taken. There were several bedrooms next to hers, presumably the same size as hers, where her friends slept. Following the corridor led to the smaller domed room where she had watched Nhima heal Syren the night before. Finally, the large dome, the training dome, connected them to the stairwell which led to the Scholars’ Chambers. To her surprise, they did not follow the staircase up. Ayda led her to another door, a door that she had not noticed before, she could hear laughter and talking voices. As Ayda opened the door for her, Elle squealed as she took in the sight before her. Her friends were all sat around the table, oddly dressed in their clean linens and all content and comfortable in each other’s presence. At the head of the table was the Scholar, laughing at a story Sir Rakel was telling of his childhood with her Father. Nhima was serving up a small portion of porridge into a stone bowl and beaming at her. Their faces all shone at her. She smiled back at them happily, until one smile caught her by surprise. Furthest from her, between Nhima and the Scholar sat a young woman, weakened and pale, but nonetheless sat, quite proudly. Her red hair had been washed and she too was sporting clean clothes. Syren. Elle sprinted faster than ever before and jumped into her arms, tears threatening to flow from her eyes.‘Careful, little one!’ Nhima exclaimed. Elle pulled away from Syren and turned to the young woman. To everyone’s glee, Elle wrapped her arms around her waist.‘Thank you so much!’ Elle wailed in happiness. Nhima blushed and softly patted the curls on the Princess’s head. Elle sat herself down between Nhima and Syren and glowed. Her heart felt as though it was on fire. She had everything. Her friends had fought for her to get here. She loved them and would do anything for them. To see Syren well, happy and sat with her dearest companions filled her with joy. Sir Rakel had been accepted it seemed, Ayda was being far more pleasant to him now that trust had been restored. Elle’s eyes locked with Ayda’s. A deep sadness was silhouetted in her eyes. Ayda had suffered much to get them here. Her over protective, caring, fierce sister had done everything in her power to keep her safe and had fought the odds to get to her. Brielle knew she had much to worry about and much to fear. The most powerful Mages on earth were hunting her, and their army was mere feet away, but right now, when she saw how much she had to lose and how many people had fought loyally beside her, she could not bring herself to fear, or to hate. When her heart weighed so heavily with adoration. The morning was one of light and laughter, the team were lifted to tremendous heights with their success. When Scholar Byran suggested they begin training, the other’s insisted on joining. Brielle could sense their eagerness and agreed, somewhat nervously. Moments later, they were positioned in the large training hall. The black crystals were gleaming brilliantly across the walls.‘First off, let’s see if my theory works.’ The ex-scholar said. He placed one clear crystal on his palm outstretched, Nhima and Elle closely surrounding it.‘Nhima is going to expel some of her Magic into it, Elle I need you to watch it closely.’ He instructed. Elle nodded. At once, a faint trickle of tiny glowing orbs spread from Nhima’s hand towards the crystal. Watching closely, Elle ascertained that the glow of magic moved through the physical boundary of the crystal and lay deep within, leaving the crystal seemingly glowing on its own. Elle explained what she saw. Next, Byran instructed the same, but this time surrounded the white crystals in rough, ebony stones, like the ones on the walls. Firstly, Nhima attempted to pour her magic into the black stones. The light could not penetrate the shell of the stones and merely rested against them unable to go any further. Then she tried to move the stones, as before the glow surrounded the stones but no matter how she tried, they could not be moved. They were unaffected by her magic.‘What does this mean?’ Elle asked.‘I believed the Ebony Stones blocked magic, and as you can see they are not affected by it either,’ The Scholar explained. ‘What you have just described to me, proves that the flow of magic cannot pass the Ebony Stones, but it can be absorbed into the crystals.’ Elle nodded. ‘What we do not know for sure, is if they block the appearance of magic.’ He scratched his head.‘Why is that important? Can all Mages sense magic?’ Ayda asked.‘Not all, but the ones you want to avoid.’ Nhima smiled.‘Can you see it?’ Elle asked Nhima. Nhima shook her head.‘There is only one Mage who can see magic, and that is yourself. But some Mages can sense it in the air, especially strong magic.’ The Scholar explained.‘If Elle goes to your quarters, do you think she could see it?’ Niall suggested cleverly. The rooms below the Scholars Quarters were imbedded with Ebony Stones, the idea was to conceal the magic within.‘It’s worth a shot.’ Elle nodded, already on her way.‘Wait! Up there you are vulnerable with just a wooden door to protect you – be careful!’ The Scholar raised his hand. Elle nodded. Knowing Ayda would follow, she proceeded up the stone stairs. Ouch! She cursed as her head hit the ceiling. The slate hearth was in place, blocking their exit. Ayda heaved with all her strength but could not shift it, it was too heavy.‘Use your magic,’ A female voice called in her mind. Elle jumped, startling Ayda, who looked at her questioningly. That voice! Elle remembered the voice well for it had haunted her dreams since the Ritual.‘Who are you?’ Elle thought back to the disembodied voice in her mind. No answer. Elle huffed, frustrated at being ignored. Elle focussed on the task at hand, the others were waiting. The hearth was heavy and going to take a lot of effort. Elle pushed her magic outwards as she had learnt before, the light spread from her outstretched hands and formed itself around the section of slate above her. She willed it to move, saw her desire clear in her mind. It would not budge. Maybe more magic, she thought. She threw more magic from within her into the stone. It shook slightly with the impact. Once more she concentrated on moving the stone, finally, slowly it lifted. Shock shook through her as she felt the weight of it strain her bones, shaking with effort, she raised the hearth just high enough for them to scramble out and then dropped it back into place behind them. The sound was louder than she had hoped.‘You were shaking, are you ok?’ Ayda asked, concerned.‘It felt heavy. I wasn’t expecting it to.’ Elle whispered, allowing herself time to recover. Sitting down in the armchairs, they waited. Elle looked for any signs of glowing magic from around her. There were none. No lights whatsoever. She disappeared into all the adjoining rooms but could not see any signs of magic from below. She was satisfied that the Scholars assumptions were correct. The Ebony Stones did block all magic, including its signs. It made her untraceable. Deciding they had examined the outside long enough, they opted to move back to the others and share their findings. Elle poured magic back into the stone to open it, and thankfully, found it easier than before. Exhausted from the effort they returned to their friends.‘So, does this mean you are right?’ Ayda asked once they had advised that Elle could not sense the magic.‘It means the Elders cannot sense Brielle and Nhima’s magic down here, which means they are safe.’ The Scholar explained.‘The Elders can sense magic too?” Elle asked, dumbfounded. Did she share a skill with the Elders? Was this why they wanted her dead?‘The Elders can sense all magic, but not see it as you do.’ Nhima continued calmly, ‘The strongest mages are sensed and marked, receiving “summons” and once in the Chamber, the patterns glow to show the Elders the remaining strength of each Mage before the magic is taken. They can then judge the power left in the Chamber.’‘They use these crystals to drain and store the magic they take from the unknowing Mages, but why they do it, I do not know.’ The Scholar finished. Elle remembered the summons on her hand. The light had glowed dimly on the night of the summons, the same as the other Elves lucky enough to be selected. They had all looked at it as a mark of importance, a mark to wear with pride and honour at being one of the few selected. Elle looked down at her hand in disgust. She remembered during the Ritual the mark lighting up on every Elf in the room, she had been startled and blinded by the brightness of her own in comparison with every other. Her parents had also been surprised, she remembered. The mark on her hand was not a medal of honour, not a mark of respect. It was a tag. A tag that had betrayed her strength to the Elders and had marked her only for death. She despised it. She thought back at the marvel of bright spheres, now knowing that she was witnessing the Ritual, witnessing the Elder’s stealing the Elves magic.‘How did you learn all of this?’ Sir Rakel asked. The Scholar sighed.‘I was studying, in the Temple Library. I came across an old book. It was buried deep in the shelves, it hadn’t been touched for centuries. The pages were crumbling to dust. I took it and carefully rewrote it. What I read shocked me. We Scholars are aware of Magic. We know it exists, albeit rarely. But we never knew it could be stolen.’ The room was deafly quiet as everyone clung onto his words. Elle was holding her breath, staying as silent as possible, waiting for the old Scholar to continue.‘I found a record, a diary entry of a Student Mage from before the Elder’s war. He was shocked to learn that he had the talent. He had tried to teach his friends the skill, but it could not be taught. He believed it was a skill that a Mage had to be born with. I read on, intrigued by the Student’s desire for study. He had learned how to store magic into stones. I never got further than that before the Legion and the other Scholars learned of my studies. The Prime Scholar banished me from the Temple and blinded me as punishment. They burned my works and experiments. I was exiled.’‘Oh my...’ Elle felt pity in her heart, this Old Man had been through so much.‘Do not pity me child, for I would be dead, if they had not underestimated what I had learned. All I had to do was fit the pieces together. The exile gave me the freedom to explore. When the King learned of an exiled Scholar not under the influence of the Elders, he was most keen to get in touch. Your Father and I spoke at length of the Ritual Chamber, and the stones within. Together we found them. But we could never be certain of our theory, until now.’ Elle’s mind was reeling. Her Father and this Scholar had worked together on this Theory? Her Father had known all of this? She felt dizzy, this was too much to take on all at once. Ayda looked as pale as she felt, confused.‘Why did Father not stop this, if he knew?’ Ayda asked quietly.‘He was not strong enough to threaten the Elders, we believed no one was.’‘Am I?’ Elle asked, hoping she wasn’t. The Elders felt so big and so mean, and she so small.‘One day you will be.’ The Scholar nodded knowingly.‘We realised your power at the same time the Elders did, we were too late.’‘How do you mean?’ Elle asked, confused. A female voice greeted through her mind. Elle stumbled, in shock she had not expected it. The same voice from the Ritual. Nhima was smiling at her.‘It was you?!’ Elle burst out, flabbergasted. The other’s looked between them in pure confusion.‘But – how – you don’t sound the same?!’ Elle continued.‘Our voices sound different in our minds because it is projection, we’re not actually speaking.’‘But – how!?’‘I can communicate through minds, as long as there is a clear channel.’ Nhima said.‘But you never reply!?’ Elle remarked.‘That’s because I can communicate – you can’t.’‘HOW?!’ Elle asked loudly, confused.‘It’s a skill of mine, I don’t use it often. It’s not often I get a clear channel.’ Nhima replied.‘A clear channel?’‘When you were in the Ritual Chamber your magic was linked to the stones, creating a kind of path between you and the destination. I sensed it and connected myself to it.’‘But that’s hundreds of miles! How did you sense that?!’‘Usually I can’t, but with the flow of that much magic from every mage in that chamber, you can just feel it if you concentrate enough. I didn’t have much time though before they traced me, or before my magic expired.’‘But why did you choose me?’‘I felt what the Elder’s saw in you the moment I connected with the channel and realised the danger we were both in. I pulled away in time, but you didn’t.’ Nhima ended apologetically.‘What did the Elder’s see?’ Elle asked frantically.‘You. The power you possess. I said before that they only hunt those who use their power or those who could threaten them. The extent of your power is so much greater than you realise.’ Elle felt sick. She stormed from the dome not wanting to hear anymore. Everything she had learned as a child was wrong. The weight of the truth bore down on her. She had been told that the Ritual was the highest honour to any Elf. The chance to speak to our Elders and to be bestowed knowledge was the greatest gift among her people, it was a lie. That was NEVER the intention. They were cattle, for farming. The Ritual had served as nothing but a harvest for the Elders to absorb all the power they could from their own people. Bile filled up in her stomach as anger took over. She had known they were wicked for wanting her dead, but to have killed and stolen and lied to her people for centuries about their own birth right revolted her. Her people didn’t know anything! They were all rich in magic and were blind to it! Lied to over centuries about magic being extinct following the war! The Elders she had once respected, worshipped and admired were suddenly everything she loathed in the world. They were the storms that drowned crops, the germs that caused disease and the fire that burned the forests. They were afraid of her, and she would show them fear. She would destroy the reign of the Elders and restore magic to her people.The knowledge that the history and tradition her people were so proud of, was a poison fed to them over years of ignorance, had ignited something inside her. Her actions were fuelled by hate, her desires energized by vengeance. She had been left alone, in the silence of her room for the remainder of the day. She guessed she was not the only one disturbed by the facts. She had seen the tears and disbelief in Sir Rakel’s usually iron eyes, the anger that burned from Syren and the despair and loss from her sister. Their history, in tatters. Even the humans could not understand this. They had been brought up away from all knowledge of magic, they didn’t even remember its existence. There were so many empty spaces in their understanding. Did humans still have magic unbeknownst to them? Or is it truly extinct in their race? She returned to the Training Dome to following morning alone. She practised on her own. She threw objects around the room with her magic, and accidentally destroyed some of the furniture in a blaze of temper. It was only when Ayda appeared, that she stopped.‘It’s a lot to take in, isn’t it?’ Ayda whispered quietly. Elle nodded in reply. At least Ayda had no magic, she hadn’t been stolen from or treated like a prized calf.‘Do you think Father knew?’ Ayda continued. Elle glared at her. Of course, Father hadn’t known. He would have put a stop to it. He would never have let her go in there to be unknowingly stripped of her magic.‘No.’ She replied harshly. Ayda winced, unused to hearing the malice in her good-hearted sister.‘He knew of magic. He used it, learned to hide it. He must have known something.’ Ayda sighed, more to herself than her sister.‘All those stories,’ Elle whispered sadly, ‘who even knows what’s true anymore.’‘Sir Rakel is heartbroken,’ Ayda replied, ‘He disappeared shortly after you and has barricaded his door. He won’t let me in.’‘Why would he let you in? You’ve been foul to him since you saw him!’ Elle let loose at her sister.‘I didn’t trust him! I was protecting you!’ Ayda replied, hurt and shocked.‘I don’t need you! I’m stronger than you – I’ve saved your life twice!’ Elle spat the venom from her mouth.‘This isn’t you – you’re shocked, and upset, I understand.’ Ayda bowed her head, and walked away, leaving Elle to her fury. No matter what Elle did, she knew Ayda would never turn on her, but the moment she disappeared, Elle stood flailing, drowning in her own guilt. She unleashed her magic once more. A small unlit candelabra flew from one wall to a cupboard at the far side of the dome, where a curse echoed. Niall emerged from his crouched hiding place.‘Niall?!’ Elle shouted, rushing over to see if he was hurt. He rubbed his arm as he stood. Why was he hiding? She thought.‘Sorry – sorry,’ He murmured, not looking her in the eye.‘What? Are you OK?’‘Fine, fine… just erm, dropped something.’ Elle knew this was a lie, she hadn’t seen him come in and both entrances were in view. He had been hiding.‘Why were you hiding?’‘Ah, um... well, you started to do your magic thing, erm, rather aggressively so I tried to stay out of your way.’ Niall replied, nervously.‘But why hide?’‘I was going to move,’ He began, ‘But then Ay – I dropped something.’ She knew what he was about to say even if he hadn’t said it. He hid because Ayda walked in. This was unlike Niall she thought. He was usually so carefree and ferocious, nothing could stand in the way of his confidence, and yet here he was cowering in front of a young girl. What had happened? She thought back to the heated conversation she walked in on yesterday between him and Ayda – had they argued? No, she thought, they were always bickering, and it never bothered him before. Or was it her? Had her power scared him?‘I’m sorry if I scared you.’ She said sadly.‘What? No!’ Niall seemed abashed, ‘I mean, it’s slightly unmanning to have a girl powerful enough to throw you and all that but it’s just... never mind. I’ll be fine.’ He thought better of his admittance, bowing mockingly to her as he had always done, and with a fleeting, secret smile, he retired and left her alone. Elle took a seat at the table near the edge of the room. The weight of centuries of deceit wore heavily on her shoulders. She slumped on to the table with her head in her hands. The group had been so strong and so happy, but the news of deceit had shaken them and shone light upon cracks. She had been so willing to trust everyone, had trusted the Elders and her parents, but the more she understood, the more she knew just how far the lies spread. The Elders had lied for centuries, her parents must have known, Ayda had been keeping secrets from her all her life, and yet Elle had laid her soul bare and loved each of them completely. Her heart was bruised, she was alone. Her old friend’s face wouldn’t appear in her memory anymore, the days of playing in the beautiful garden around her favourite tree were gone. Gone from her past and her future. She shook her head, she could not fall into despair. Yes, all she had believed was a lie. But she knew the truth, she knew she was powerful, and she knew that despite it all – she was not alone. There were thousands of Elves all with magic, in the dark about the power glowing brightly within them. There had to be a way to free them all! A young, dark woman walked through the door slowly. Her face was full of sorrow, not kindly as before. Nhima approached wearily and sat down opposite Elle.‘When I was younger than your age, I found my magic by accident,’ Nhima began, ‘My love was my garden. As a child I spent countless hours with my Grandmother, planting seeds and watering the flowers. One year, a snowstorm obliterated our fields, our crops were destroyed. My garden turned white with snow. I remember sitting in the cold snow alone, crying. We were poor, and we were hungry, there was not much to take pleasure from, my saplings and shrubs had all faded. I thought my eyes had been frozen shut by my tears, I had cried for so long. When I dared to open them, I found myself surrounded by a circle of snowdrops.’ Elle opened her mouth in awe. What a wonder that must have been! Nhima’s eyes shone with the memory, a memory that held such a magnificent hold on her heart.‘What did you do?’ Elle asked in an excited whisper.‘My Grandmother had been watching from a window, she ushered me inside so quickly. My Grandmother was a mage. A weak one, like me. She taught me to use what I have.’‘Weak?’ Elle asked.‘Yes, neither me nor my Grandmother were summoned, we were not strong enough to be of use to the Ritual.’‘What happened once you learned your magic?’‘Death,’ Nhima’s eyes glassed over, she was staring at something on the wall opposite. Perhaps shielding her eyes from the horrors, she had witnessed.‘I’m sor-’ Elle began, looking down.Nhima continued her story, ‘The Elders found out and the Legion came in the night. My Grandmother hid me well, they tortured her for my whereabouts. I had never seen magic used that way before… Grandmother taught me to defend, to grow and to heal. But my skill was not enough to save her. They burned our house down with me inside, they believed me to be dead. They searched for years after and never heard of me again.’ Elle shook her head and wiped the racing tears from her cheeks. Nhima had not looked at her once throughout her story. Her face was set like stone, she had grown into a strong and formidable Elf, Brielle thought, her Grandmother would be proud. Elle jumped slightly as Nhima grabbed her hands and looked her deep in the eye. Nhima’s eyes were dark brown, a sorrow was hidden by a passion so strong, Elle thought she saw flames flicker in their reflection.‘Together we can stop this Princess,’ She said, quietly and assertively, ‘I am sorry to tell you all this so soon, but we have never known the Elder’s so afraid. You must be prepared.’‘Yes,’ Elle felt as strongly as she, no more blood was going to be shed to hide magic, no more families destroyed, ‘Teach me.’Nhima’s story had resuscitated Brielle. She found herself more driven and controlled than ever before. There was no more hope of getting to her Mother. She realised there was a bigger picture. The thought of never seeing her Mother again crushed her heart, but if she could prevent other families from enduring the pain that she and Nhima had gone through, all in the name of magic, she knew her sacrifice would be worth it. That day, they had practised well into the night. Nhima had taught her how to shape her magic. Elle had perfected the art of moving small things with her magic, but now she saw that had been easy. Nhima and Byran had shown her how to visualise and feel exactly what she wanted to achieve and to morph her power into the living embodiment of her dream. It was tough work. They wanted her to start a fire. She had focussed and stared at the collection of wood for so long her eyes hurt but it wasn’t enough. She cast out her magic towards the wood, but it did nothing. The tiny orbs of light dissipated, wasted. Nhima explained she had to see the fire, smell it, hear it, and feel it. Elle could see the tiny flame in her mind, she could see it dancing with the smallest change in breeze, she could see growing, consuming the wood and the oxygen. She could hear it cracking the branches and sizzling the air. But it was not enough! She focussed on the feeling, she imagined the warmth enveloping her after a cold day, felt the sweat on her brow.‘All at once Princess – you can do it!’ Nhima encouraged. The effort was immense. Never had she realised how much concentration it took to do everything at once. It was hard to see, feel, hear and smell something that didn’t exist. Harder still to force her mind to believe it. Then she realised. Her mind was her limit. If her mind did not believe it, how on earth could it ever be! Pushing her magic out, the heat wrapped around her, she soaked up the warmth, willing her every bone to believe in its presence. She kept her eyes closed, she found it easier to visualise with her eyes closed. The crackle of the fire and smell of burning wood reached her senses. Believe it, believe it, she willed herself. Distantly, outside of herself she heard clapping and laughter. Forgetting herself, she opened her eyes to see what the fuss was about. Flames! A fire was roaring ferociously before her. Her friends had joined into witness and were laughing and celebrating her success. She felt a smile spread across her lips. She did it! Elle found herself bouncing up and down with the other’s in excitement. Her eagerness soon ebbed away as Nhima told her she now had to extinguish it. Elle didn’t understand, how could she do that.‘Let me show you.’ Nhima offered. Elle stood transfixed as she watched. Nhima’s power poured from within her. The magic surrounded the fire. Brielle watched as the lights changed form and created a clear veil around the fire. Slowly, the fire dimmed down, gradually receding to embers.‘How did you -?’ Elle asked, she hadn’t understood.‘The easiest way to put out a fire, is to eliminate what it needs most. Usually air.’ Byran explained. It clicked. Nhima had created a veil of power around the fire to smother it and starve it of air. Excitement rose within her. She could do that! Elle practised the same drill throughout the day. Lighting the fire and then extinguishing it. She started off slow, with her eyes closed, and sweat pouring from her as she plunged the deep depths of concentration. Eventually, it became more comfortable, and soon, it took mere seconds for a fire to spring into life and die. By the end of the day she was exhausted and relieved to crawl into her bed. Excitement and pride coursed through her veins; she did not believe she could ever drift off to sleep as each triumphant rekindling sparked into her mind clear as day. Eventually she drifted off, her dreams filled with her family and the magic she longed to perform to save them.",

      "content": "17 – NIALLThe day had come. He was leaving. His body was aching from tossing and turning most of the night, unsure whether he was doing the right thing. He stared up at the ceiling, listening to the thunderous snores from one of the other two beds in the room. Karl was soundly sleeping, excited at the prospect of returning home, at last. The Fiends would be waiting for him, and Martha, and he was looking forward to his home comforts, he could almost taste the ale, and the plentiful food waiting for him at the Bridge Inn. He had every reason to be excited, it had been a long time since he had seen his comrades and he missed the brotherhood. Niall had promised the Elven Princesses his protection, but now he was no longer needed. It had taken longer than he anticipated, and they had been through more trials than he expected, but it had been worth it, for he believed that they were the key to whatever story was unfolding. He shoved off the covers from the bed, giving up on any hope of getting the last bit of shut eye and rose out of bed. It was going to be a long journey home and even though they had been sleeping in warm beds for the last few days, he felt no better rested. Shaking the sleepless frustration from his face, grabbed his now clean clothes and began changing into his travelling gear.‘We leaving?’ Theo asked quietly, from where he was rested in bed. Theo face was etched with excitement, he didn’t get much sleep either it would seem.‘After breakfast. The Scholar has offered up some rations for the journey,’ Niall replied.Theo didn’t need encouraging, he leapt out of bed faster than necessary and began to climb into his gear.‘Oi, Karl, wake up!’ He urged, throwing Karl’s gear on top of him. The large man grunted out of his snoring slumber, dazed he rubbed his eyes. Niall hadn’t noticed the way Karl’s feet hung from the end of the bed; he was too tall.‘It will take us a while to get home.’ Theo continued, pulling on his shirt.‘Yep, no rest for the wicked.’ Niall replied sombrely.‘You sure you want to go?’ Theo stopped, and regarded his friend. Niall had not hidden his emotions well enough. He cursed silently. He hated people guessing his thoughts, he used to be the cocky one who had no cares, why couldn’t he go back to that?‘There’s no reason for us to stay.’‘There is, you know there is.’ Theo replied.‘I want to know the truth,’ Niall snapped back, ‘If what we have learned is true then our people should have magic, if these Elves’ Elders are stopping their magic, then what’s happened to ours? What do you think happens to us, once the Elves have their magic returned?’‘How do you plan on finding out?’ Karl asked sleepily, pushing himself up.‘The Capital.’ Karl groaned audibly. The journey to Oakwood Town was long enough, but the Capital was even further. The City was massive in comparison to any settlement they had seen on their journey, but it was also overcrowded. Most of the humans had moved into the Capital over the years, and there were but a handful of towns and villages surrounding it, Oakwood Town being the furthest away.‘So, we’re not going home?’ Karl grumbled.‘Yes, my friend, we’re going home. Then I go to the Capital, you don’t have to join me.’They dressed and gathered their belongings in silence. Niall fixed his sword to his waist and slid into his jacket as Theo slid his twin blades into to their sheaths. With a final check of the room to make sure they left nothing behind they vacated. Quietly, careful not to wake anyone, they tiptoed up the corridor towards the pantry in the dome. Scholar Byran was waiting for them with a linen package.He held it out to Niall who thanked him.‘It’s not much, I have to be careful not to draw attention, our supplies are monitored.’ He said apologetically.‘I understand, thank you.’ Niall nodded.‘We can hunt on the road, don’t you worry,’ Theo added. They all sat down at the table and ate their porridge in silence. Niall was torn. He felt he had to leave, for his people. He had found a scrap of history and a slice of truth and he needed to find out what happened to magic amongst humans. If he could find a Mage, he could help Elle. She was so young to face the burden alone. The Elders feared her, that was the truth, but why, none of them knew. She could see magic, but how could that help her? He desperately wanted to find someone to share her burden, there had to be another Mage out there, there had to be magic in the Human bloodline somewhere, he had to find it. The Princess was pure and kind, but he wondered how long that would last. Then there was Ayda, he didn’t want to leave. He hated saying goodbye last time, this time was worse. Before, they had been children, the path not yet theirs to choose, now they were free, they found themselves even less in control. Things had changed between them. Their relationship had warmed slowly over the journey, her bias towards Humanity had almost disappeared, and he found himself enjoying her presence. Yet now, he knew, she no longer wanted him here.‘Will you say goodbye for us?’ Niall asked quietly.‘What? We’re not saying goodbye?’ Theo spluttered.‘I think it’s for the best.’ Niall responded, not meeting his eye.‘So, you can’t change your mind you mean?’‘That’s not –’‘You’re running away from her, aren’t you?’ Theo scoffed.‘No-’ Niall blushed. Shit. That’s embarrassing he thought. He hadn’t told them of his feelings for Ayda, he had kept them locked away for years, denying it to himself most of the time. How could he deny them now? When even he had to accept how he felt for her, and how much she hurt him that night?‘You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself,’ Theo continued sharply.‘It’s quite pathetic.’ Karl nodded. Niall was surprised at his contribution. Karl was usually the silent one in awkward conversations.‘Either tell her, or don’t tell her, but stop lying to yourself.’ Theo finished, playing with his porridge.‘I know!’ Niall had had enough. Was this a tag match? Niall shook his head. Since when were his friends so concerned with his love life? It had felt good to hate her, hating her was much easier. He had spent so much time thinking about her and doing everything he could for her, with no appreciation that it had felt good to sever that connection.‘Well if you’re happy to walk away and never see them again then fine. Whatever.’ Theo finished, finishing his porridge. In an awkward silence, they finished their breakfast and headed to the chamber doors. Thanking the old Scholar once more, they moved. Niall hoped the feeling in the trio would change, he didn’t fancy the journey in complete silence. Checking they had what they needed, Theo grumbled something about his knife, and headed back to the room alone. Niall hoped he was quick, he wanted to get away. About ten seconds later, he reappeared, looking slightly aghast. Ayda had followed him, closely tailed by Elle. They both looked hurt, Elle had tears in her eyes. Damn it, Niall thought.‘You were leaving without saying goodbye?’ Elle said. The tone of her voice cut him like ice through the heart, he had hurt her deeply. He bent down to her.‘I thought it would be for the best, Princess,’ He replied, honestly. Elle wrapped her arms around him and squeezed.‘You must miss your home,’ She whispered in his ear.‘I do, but that’s not why I’m leaving,’ Niall replied, ‘you have opened my eyes, and now I need to find the truth of my people,’ Elle pulled away and cocked her head to side curiously, her eyes wide. He meant it, he was going to hunt another Mage, and bring them back to her, to share the burden alone. There had to be magic amongst the humans, there had to be.‘If Elves have magic again, Humans must have too.’ He continued. He hoped this was true. The Elder’s had been stealing the Elves’ Magic, so what had been happening to the humans? Was it gone? Dead to the race, or lost? He had to find out. The Elves were on the verge of dawn, if they managed to defeat the Elders, then Magic would be awakened, and the humans would be vulnerable. There had to be magic in their veins, and if he found it in time, then he could save Ayda and Elle from the battles before them. He wished for that more than anything. He looked Ayda in the eye for the last time, there was deep hurt there, and a secret, her gaze flicked away and then back to him. They held the same sorrow he remembered when they were children, a sorrow that had nearly melted away. He hoped his eyes portrayed his apology because in that moment, he couldn’t find a voice to whisper his pain, as he turned away from them and headed home.",

      "content": "LORELEI‘They have arrived,’‘He was true to his word.’ The cave was cold and draughty, the roaring fire in the centre swayed violently in the gust. An occasional drop of water echoed through the white stone cavern, leaving a glittering trail down the walls in its wake. The cave was lit by several flickering candles in tall stands. The dancing flames were dazzling through cavern by the reflection from pristine golden armour. Elven Knights littered the large cavern, all muttering quietly between themselves, several were positioned watching over the entrance. Two grand, white-stone thrones were resting proudly at the head of the hollow, one throne was occupied by a woman with a stern face and scrawled with worry lines. Her long blonde hair was plaited tightly and was trailing down her chest. There were no jewels and no luxurious cloth on her body, instead she was sat in her own armour, her golden breastplate sporting the royal emblem, with a crown embossed into the detailing. Before her, was a soldier sporting his own golden armour, rested in the precious metal were rubies, seemingly alive with the glittering candlelight.‘Your Majesty, our scouts have returned from the lowlands, more and more of our people are seeking refuge,’ Sir Morcei announced calmly and respectfully.‘Yes, yes, but we are too few to offer valuable assistance, we must wait for the right moment.’ Queen Lorelei sighed.‘The Legion are destroying whole towns in search of the Princess.’ Sir Morcei continued remorsefully. To his surprise, the Queen chuckled.‘From previous reports, I would say one Captain seriously underestimated my Princess,’ She grinned proudly.‘It will not take long for them to search the Temple for her, she cannot hide her magic.’ Sir Morcei pressed respectfully. Queen Lorelei ignored him, she had faith in her daughters, they were all that stood in the way of destruction.‘The Legion control much of my Army, Sir Morcei. I am lucky that Sir Rakel and yourself have won around the few soldiers that we have but we do not have the numbers for an uprising.’ The Queen began,‘I think that was more out of loyalty for your Majesties, than for us Protectors,’ Sir Morcei complimented,‘Nevertheless, we could not hide hundreds of Elves climbing the footholds of this Mountain, and as we are the only line of defence in Myrliar, we need our secrecy,’‘I understand, but the Humans…’ Sir Morcei continued to press. It was a mark of their understanding and respect for one another that the Queen allowed his persistent questioning. In truth, she was much indebted to him for bringing her to the bunker and raising her remaining soldiers to her defence, he had been a lifeline for her. The cave she found herself now residing had been created in secret within the Peal Mountains, a hideaway for the Royal Family in its darkest hours. Queen Lorelei had not known of it, Sir Rakel, as the King’s Chief Protector had located it and ensured the safe arrival of her and her loyal guard. The bunker as she liked to call it, had been designed for a family. Several basic, but private rooms had been carved into the stone, and yet, with a pang of the heart strings, she found herself quite alone. She had believed her family to be dead and had fallen into hopelessness, and yet when word got out that her daughters, Ayda and Elle had escaped she had been reborn. Sir Rakel had offered to guide them, keen to make up for failing to protect her beloved husband, and she had gladly accepted. She would have sent her entire battalion to them, but she knew, that they would serve little purpose and more of a hindrance in a Mages’ War. She had many regrets, many worries that kept her up at night, and left her brooding in the day. There were things she longed for the chance to say to her children, but now was not the time. They had arrived safely with the Scholar, and she had to fight the war alone for now, until they were ready to play their part.‘The Humans are rallying, yes, I had expected as much.’ Lorelei conceded,‘The smallest sign of weakness from Myrliar and they are over us like rodents.’ Sir Morcei said disgusted.‘There has not been war between Elves and Humans in years, mere border disputes and raids, King Devan is the most peaceful King that ever lead the Humans. This was not his decision; someone else’s hand is at play here.’ The Queen replied thoughtfully.‘Then who?’ Sir Morcei asked,‘I believe we are pieces on a board, and soon, the players will be unveiled. But it is not yet time.’‘Calumnia is preparing its humans to attack Myrliar, The Legion are blinded and destructive in their search for Princess Brielle, there is no one to protect what remains of our people who are scattered across the land, and we are vastly outnumbered…’‘Yes, but soon, we will have a Mage…’ The Queen finished, hope singing through her voice.‘The Legion have several Mages…’‘My daughter has the power of her birth right, power that only one Mage has had before her.’‘You will put your daughter on the front line?’‘She is our only chance in the war to come, we have enemies all around us, and without her power we will fall.’‘Then let us hope she masters her magic, but for one so young…’‘She will do it. She must. She is the only one with the power to do so. She just doesn’t know it yet.’END OF BOOK 1.",

An occasional drop of water echoed through the white stone cavern, leaving a glittering trail down the walls in its wake. The cave was lit by several flickering candles in tall stands. The dancing flames were dazzling through cavern by the reflection from pristine golden armour. Elven Knights littered the large cavern, all muttering quietly between themselves, several were positioned watching over the entrance. Two grand, white-stone thrones were resting proudly at the head of the hollow, one throne was occupied by a woman with a stern face and scrawled with worry lines. Her long blonde hair was plaited tightly and was trailing down her chest. There were no jewels and no luxurious cloth on her body, instead she was sat in her own armour, her golden breastplate sporting the royal emblem, with a crown embossed into the detailing. Before her, was a soldier sporting his own golden armour, rested in the precious metal were rubies, seemingly alive with the glittering candlelight.‘Your Majesty, our scouts have returned from the lowlands, more and more of our people are seeking refuge,’ Sir Morcei announced calmly and respectfully.‘Yes, yes, but we are too few to offer valuable assistance, we must wait for the right moment.’ Queen Lorelei sighed.‘The Legion are destroying whole towns in search of the Princess.’ Sir Morcei continued remorsefully. To his surprise, the Queen chuckled.‘From previous reports, I would say one Captain seriously underestimated my Princess,’ She grinned proudly.‘It will not take long for them to search the Temple for her, she cannot hide her magic.’ Sir Morcei pressed respectfully. Queen Lorelei ignored him, she had faith in her daughters, they were all that stood in the way of destruction.‘The Legion control much of my Army, Sir Morcei. I am lucky that Sir Rakel and yourself have won around the few soldiers that we have but we do not have the numbers for an uprising.’ The Queen began,‘I think that was more out of loyalty for your Majesties, than for us Protectors,’ Sir Morcei complimented,‘Nevertheless, we could not hide hundreds of Elves climbing the footholds of this Mountain, and as we are the only line of defence in Myrliar, we need our secrecy,’‘I understand, but the Humans…’ Sir Morcei continued to press. It was a mark of their understanding and respect for one another that the Queen allowed his persistent questioning. In truth, she was much indebted to him for bringing her to the bunker and raising her remaining soldiers to her defence, he had been a lifeline for her. The cave she found herself now residing had been created in secret within the Peal Mountains, a hideaway for the Royal Family in its darkest hours. Queen Lorelei had not known of it, Sir Rakel, as the King’s Chief Protector had located it and ensured the safe arrival of her and her loyal guard. The bunker as she liked to call it, had been designed for a family. Several basic, but private rooms had been carved into the stone, and yet, with a pang of the heart strings, she found herself quite alone.
