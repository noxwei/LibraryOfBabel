      "content": "1 In the Shadow of Dawn Jack Bishop toiled in the long evening shadow of the Ark. Soon his work would be illuminated only by the floodlights that lined the pit and the flames that spat from his blow torch. It was better to work at night. Ever since the first solar flare hit Earth, the hours of daylight had become steadily less hospitable. But it wasn't just rising temperatures that made life difficult during the day. The radiation was worse. With each flare the Earth's atmosphere grew weaker, letting in ionised protons that first made you sick, and then… well, there wasn't much of a then after that. Your organs turned to slush and then you died. So yes, it was better to work at night… if you were lucky enough to have work, that is. Six solar flares had followed the first, increasing in regularity. The most recent two had been spread only four months apart. Each brought with it fresh challenges. Sickness and death on a pandemic scale. The temporary shutdown of every electronic system on the planet. The fall of authority and the rise of terrorist factions. And widespread panic, which only grew once the United Earth Government finally confirmed what everyone had long been thinking. The sun was dying, and it was taking the Earth with it. Jack wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand and watched as the last yellow sliver of sun disappeared below the horizon. Good riddance to it. His thermals and tools would give him all the warmth he needed. He popped his mask down and went back to welding the panels and pipes along the drop ship's exterior. The metalwork glowed an angry red. Last week it had been a scientific research vessel. The week before that, a prototype jet. It made little difference to Jack. He fell in love with every ship he worked on… but he was never going to ride in one, let alone get the chance to sit in its pilot seat. An engineer. Huh. It was a far cry from the dream he once had for himself. But dreams had short shelf-lives those days. He made do, same as everyone else. He winced as sparks jumped out from behind the fuselage panels he was welding together. He gave them a second to cool, then carried on. It was hard and grubby work. Thankless, too. But it meant he could collect government-issued food rations each week as payment, and he supposed he ought to be grateful. Many didn't even get that. Morgan sidled up beside him, using a rivet gun to drill bolts into the panels Jack had just soldered. He mouthed something Jack couldn't hear. Jack dampened the flame on his blow torch and lifted up his mask again. \"Sorry, what?\" \"I said, did you hear about Akeno?\" Jack's blood turned cold. In the ship construction business, that sort of sentence rarely meant anything good. \"No? What happened?\" \"Dumb sod got his finger torn off trying to fit a turbine onto a ship that had already been brought online for testing. He's lucky it wasn't a lot worse. They struck him off the payroll, though. The new guy coming to replace him seems all right.\" \"What? How can they fire him for that? What's he going to do?\" Morgan shrugged and punched another rivet into the panel beside them. \"Poor guy,\" said Jack, shaking his head. \"Should we send some rations round to his place?\" Morgan barked a single dry laugh. \"You telling me you and Amber have got some to spare?\" Jack snapped his mouth shut. His colleague had a point. Engineers were given barely enough to get by each week as it was. If Akeno had any sense at all, he'd been setting aside a mouthful each week for emergencies like everyone else. \"Didn't think so,\" said Morgan, smirking. The two of them snapped down their masks and got back to work. * * * About half an hour later, Morgan nudged him in the ribs. \"Watch out. Trouble's coming.\" Jack tightened the valve on his blow torch and glanced up at the walkway that overlooked both their construction pit and the next one along. Standing beside the supervisor was a young man in military uniform. They were deep in discussion. The supervisor didn't look pleased about whatever was being said. She caught Jack staring up at them and clicked her fingers in his direction. \"Bishop. Clearly you don't have enough to do. Get up here.\" Morgan winced behind his welding mask. \"Sorry, bud.\" He went back to punching rivets into the hull of the drop ship. \"Good luck.\" Jack deposited his mask and blow torch on the workbench at the side of the pit and then hurried up the rusty metal steps to the walkway. A few of the other engineers looked up from their work as he passed. He felt his face turn red. \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"They need an engineer over at Applied Research.\" She nodded at the soldier, not even trying to hide her frustration. \"Don't ask me why they can't get their own guys to work on it. We're already thin on the ground here as it is.\" Jack jabbed his thumb over his shoulder. \"Do I need to grab my stuff?\" The soldier stiffened, but his face gave nothing away. \"Everything you need will be provided at the facility,\" he said. Jack raised an eyebrow at his supervisor. \"Go on,\" she said, starting to lose her patience. \"They'll bring you back before the end of your shift.\" He followed the soldier across the walkway to the other side of the pit. A small buggy was waiting for them, its motor idling, black smoke puffing out its exhaust. Nobody cared all that much about burning through fossil fuels anymore. The soldier sat behind the driver's seat. Jack climbed into the back. They set off down the tarmac. \"Don't suppose you can tell me what this job is about?\" The soldier didn't reply. Jack sighed and leaned back in his seat. He supposed it didn't matter, so long as he still got paid at the end of it. The Applied Research facility was deep inside the Sandhurst base, and about as close to the Ark as one could get. Nobody knew what went on inside there but Jack had his suspicions, same as everyone else. It was no secret that the world's scientists were struggling to solve the problem of interstellar travel. Not the distances per se, but the time it would take to cross them. At the speed of light, it may only take a ship four years to reach the next solar system. But realistically, if they were hoping to arrive somewhere viable for human colonisation, the figure might be closer to a thousand. Either they were trying to get cryogenic chambers and other forms of stasis to work, or they were experimenting with another form of space travel altogether. That was Jack's guess, anyway. He stuck his head out the side of the buggy and felt the wind against his face. Ahead of them, the colossal iron bulk of the Ark grew even bigger. Floodlights as big as swimming pools cast their pale white gaze across the name painted down its flank in letters the size of tower blocks – Final Dawn UK-02. Helicopters vigilantly patrolled the night sky on the lookout for rogue factions hoping to disrupt production. The Arks were glorious. Ugly and industrial, yes… but glorious. Each was designed to the exact same specifications as every other – two kilometres long, almost a kilometre in diameter, and cylindrical like a barrel. Once in orbit, the barrel would rotate, giving the semblance of gravity. The idea was like a man swinging a bucket of water above his head – so long as he kept on swinging, centrifugal force would keep the water from falling out. The United Kingdom had three Arks – the proportionate number allocated to it by the United Earth Government according to its population. The United States had fifteen and China thirty, though each had lost one to terrorists since work on the project began. Nations too small to be allocated Arks of their own were partnered with larger ones. Just shy of two hundred ships were being built in total, with resources pooled from all around the world. While the Earth died, the Arks would take humanity to the stars. Or some of it, at least. Each Ark had been designed to carry approximately three hundred thousand people – passengers and crew. Even combining the capacity of all two hundred ships, that was still only sixty million. Sixty million humans would have a chance to start again. The overwhelming remainder would be left behind to die with their planet. A couple of generations more was the best anyone still on Earth could hope for. Maybe less than that. Tickets were promised to soldiers, physicists, biologists, zoologists, chemists, diplomats, pilots, doctors, artists, chefs, professors, accountants and plenty of engineers – though none at such a low level as Jack. They even had a few lawyers. These, plus many others from desirable professions, were the people humanity needed to survive on a new world. The rest of the spaces aboard the Arks would be awarded to the general public via a lottery... and even then, only to those who met the strict health criteria. Jack had come to terms with the fact he wouldn't get a ticket long before enlisting to work as an engineer. Neither would his wife, Amber. Neither would Morgan or anyone else they knew, most likely. There was nothing they could do but accept it, keep their heads down, and carry on. Jack wriggled about, trying to get comfortable on the buggy's hard plastic seats. It was a bumpy ride. Racing down the empty runways, they were already most of the way to the science facility. He had to crane his neck if he wanted to see the antenna standing triumphant at the top of the Ark. He could only imagine the worlds that ship would one day see, the secrets of the universe she might discover. Who knew what was out there waiting. Of course Jack was jealous of those with tickets. Of course he was. Angry, even. They had a future, and he didn't. But it wasn't jealousy that kept him lying awake at the end of his shifts. It was regret. Regret for the potential he squandered back when he'd been barely more than a kid, when each new sunrise brought only opportunity, when graduating from Pilot Academy had seemed a far scarier dream than backpacking the world with his girlfriend. Regret for the future he'd left behind. * * * Jack wasn't surprised the boffins in Applied Science had needed to send for an outside engineer. For all their expertise in quantum computers and theoretical superluminal transportation, none of them could wrap their heads around the complexity of a standard-issue blow torch. There had been some sort of accident in the lab. Jack wasn't privy to the specifics of the experiment, nor to the nature of the technology he was expected to fix. Need to know basis, and all that. That was fine by him – the tech guys only needed Jack to do the sort of grunt work they were too smart to learn how to do themselves anyway. Punching panels back into shape. Swapping out the broken ones and welding new ones into place. Nobody spoke to him except to bark instructions. On the rare occasion anybody bothered to look in his direction, they did so as if he were a snotty kid dragged into the office by his parent. There weren't many smiles going around. Whatever their project was, it didn't appear to be going well. Jack hammered an electrically charred piece of metal loose from the back of the strange machine he'd been brought in to fix. He tossed it aside, then sighed. \"This doesn't happen every time you run your experiment, right?\" One of the impatient technicians shooed him out of the way and bent down to inspect the machine's wiring. Jack stepped back, shrugged his eyebrows and tried to look as invisible as he felt. He may have had no idea what the machine was for, but there was no mistaking the damage it had suffered, even for an engineer as amateur as Jack. Electrical overload from a power surge. Its innards had still been smoking when Jack arrived. It sure was a peculiar device. He could see why it would need a lot of juice. While the base consisted mostly of power nodes and electrical panels, the bulk of the machine was a giant sphere, sitting atop the base like a snow globe. Hundreds of black, interlocking hexagons formed a shield around it. A few had buckled from the accident. There was a door open in its side. Jack tried to peer in. He couldn't see much, but he thought he could make out a woman in a hazmat suit. She was spraying a white mist— \"Hey. Hey!\" Somebody was clicking their fingers in front of his face. He slowly turned to look at the technicians. \"Punch that last panel shut,\" said one of them, scowling. \"Then get out of here.\" Jack crouched down beside the open panel as the technicians hurried back to their computer stations. Nothing looked particularly fire-damaged. Nothing that was his business, at any rate. He grabbed the fresh panel, positioned it accordingly, then reached for the power drill. Two people marched through the set of double doors opposite him. Jack almost dropped his screws. He would have recognised the woman even if she hadn't been wearing her military uniform. Her name was Captain Blatch. Everybody on base knew who she was. When the time came for the Final Dawn UK-02 to leave Earth, she would be the one at the helm. Officially, one of the three most accomplished pilots in the country. In Jack's opinion, one of the most accomplished in the entire world. He couldn't begin to imagine the pressure she had to be feeling – the responsibility not just for the survival of all three hundred thousand individuals who would be on board her ship, but the future of humanity as well. She was in heated discussion with a wiry man in a lab coat. His black hair was floppy and unkempt. Dark bags hung under his eyes. Jack had never seen him before, but that was hardly surprising. He doubted the scientists had much time to socialise with anyone, and besides – Jack didn't recognise half the engineers in his own pit. They came to an abrupt stop only a few metres from the corner where he was crouched. Jack kept his head down and pretended to be working. \"Absolutely not.\" Captain Blatch pointed up at the machine. \"Look at the state of this thing. It's been eighteen months, Reeves. What progress have you actually made?\" \"We’re so close,\" said the man called Reeves, pinching his fingers together. \"The technology is almost there. You saw it work this evening! Well, sort of. All that's left is to figure out how to get the telemetry right. I need to run more tests.\" \"Not with my pilots, you won't. There's no point building an armada of ships if we haven't got anyone left to fly them. Find your own test subjects if you must. Better still, use goats.\" Jack's heart skipped a beat. Were they in need of volunteers? \"No, it has to be a pilot,\" said Reeves, stepping in front of Captain Blatch as she went to leave. She stiffened. \"The g-force, the blood pressure – anyone without proper training would black out the moment we began. The data we'd pull off them would be useless.\" \"Then make your machine better,\" was Captain Blatch's stern reply. She marched past him. \"The Final Dawn will be carrying hundreds of thousands of civilians, none of whom will have flight experience. There's no use in us taking off at all if your technology is going to give everyone on board a brain haemorrhage.\" Jack's hands were so sweaty he could barely keep a grip on his power drill. This was his chance to get a ticket on one of the Arks. If they were struggling to fill their quota of pilots, maybe they'd take a chance on an unqualified one. He knew he had to speak up. Even if they threw him in the brig for it, he'd never forgive himself if he didn't try. \"I'm a pilot,\" said Jack, raising his hand. \"I'll do it.\" Everybody in the laboratory fell silent. Captain Blatch looked at him as if he were a brown goo leaking out from a crack in the floor. \"Who the hell are you?\" He stood up straight. \"Jack Bishop, ma'am.\" She eyed him up and down. \"If you're a pilot, why are you dressed like a bloody engineer?\" \"Because I am an engineer, ma'am.\" Reeves tapped away at the transparent data pad in his hand. Jack guessed he was searching through the files of everybody registered on the base. He handed the pad to Captain Blatch a second later. \"Says here you never qualified from the Academy.\" She took one look at the data pad and then slammed it back into Reeves' hands. \"So you're not a pilot, then. Thanks for wasting my time.\" Jack's heart fell into a shallow puddle of ice-water. He prepared himself to be dragged out of the lab by the same grumpy soldier who had brought him in. \"Hang on a second,\" said Reeves, reading through the entries in Jack's record. \"He went through all the tests. Ran plenty of simulations. He's not completely green. I could use him.\" \"If you're worried about people blacking out, I was fine inside the human centrifuge.\" Jack coughed awkwardly. \"Came top of my class, actually.\" \"For the short while you were actually in class,\" Captain Blatch replied. Every time she looked at him, Jack felt as if his whole head caught on fire. \"Forget it, Reeves. Absolutely not. This idiot has no idea what he's getting himself into. It's completely against regulation.\" \"Come on, Captain.\" Reeves was practically pleading with her. \"We need to continue the experiments, one way or another. We'll never get off this planet if we don't.\" Captain Blatch sighed and turned back to Jack. She gave a curt nod in the direction of the mysterious machine. \"You do understand the level of risk involved, right?\" Jack studied the buckled hexagonal shields and the electrical panels from which smoke had been wafting only minutes before. He swallowed hard. \"Pilots get a ticket on the Final Dawn, right?\" \"Qualified ones do, yes. Why? Do you want one?\" \"Two, ma'am. One for me, and one for my wife.\" Captain Blatch rolled her eyes and turned on her heels. \"Make sure he signs a non-disclosure agreement,\" she said, marching out of the room. \"And for goodness sake, make sure it goes right this time.\" Jack felt cold relief wash over him. He couldn't stop his legs from shaking. \"Is that a yes?\" he asked. \"It's as close to one as we're likely to get,\" replied Reeves, darting across the room. He stuck out his hand. \"Pleased to meet you, Jack.\" Jack shook it. Now they were stood next to one another, Jack was surprised to discover that Reeves was still in his early thirties – no more than a few years older than himself. His jaw was covered in patches of neglected stubble. The name tag pinned to his lab coat said his first name was Everett. \"When's the earliest you can get here tomorrow?\" asked Reeves. There was a hint of excited impatience in his voice. \"My shift normally starts at nineteen-hundred.\" \"Get here by eighteen-hundred, then. Don't worry, we'll square it with your supervisor.\" Reeves motioned for the soldier standing by the door to come forward. \"Speaking of which, we'd better get you back to where we found you.\" Jack turned to look from Everett to the approaching soldier, then back again. \"So does this mean I'll be getting tickets?\" The words came blurting out from Jack's mouth quicker than he could stop them. Reeves let out a single dry laugh as the soldier guided Jack towards the exit. \"Let's see how tomorrow goes first. Oh, and Jack?\" Jack paused by the door. \"Yes?\" \"Are you good with secrets?\" Jack nodded with a shrug. \"Good.\" Everett Reeves turned away and started typing at one of the computers. \"Best to keep this one to yourself.\"",

      "content": "2 Amber Sleep did not come easily for Jack. He lay in bed beside his wife, fretting until long after the sun had risen. When he did finally slip under, his dreams were hot and restless. He found himself standing on a bright and empty shore, the waves lapping at the sand and his shoes. The cool ocean air whistled through his ears and swept his hair. Everything was calm, quiet… and completely wrong. He sensed Amber standing beside him, but when he went to speak to her, she was gone. A seagull circled in the air above, going nowhere. Jack felt much the same way. Each time he turned to leave, he found himself facing the sea again. But that was fine. Like the gull, he had no place else to go. And it was a nice view… until the sea began to boil. At first it merely bubbled along the shore, as if some strange amphibious beast lay in wait beneath the surface. Then all the waves died in an instant, leaving the whole ocean unnervingly flat and still, and the pops and belches of the water spread all the way from Jack's feet to the edge of the horizon, where the blinding sun had grown fat and consumed the sky. The once cool breeze now scolded the skin on Jack's arms and face. He looked up to see the gull burst into flames. Even in death it continued on its eternal loop, until finally its charred skeleton plummeted into the rising mists. The sea had turned to steam. Jack went to run, but the sand had hardened to glass around his feet. He gritted his teeth and kicked, but no matter how hard he struggled, he couldn't get the ground to shatter. His skin began to weep and blister. The air was sucked from his lungs. He raised his head just in time to see the flickering red tongues of the sun devour the crystalline planet as it raced towards him— Jack sat up in bed, hyperventilating. His covers were drenched in sweat. He closed his eyes and counted backwards from ten. By the time Jack reached zero, he had something resembling a healthy heart rate again. This was hardly the first time he'd suffered that nightmare. The same one came most nights. Had done since around the time of the first solar flare, in fact. He doubted they would ever stop of their own accord, just as he doubted everyone else he knew didn't have similar nightmares of their own – even if they didn't like talking about them. Jack let out a final sigh, then turned to look at his alarm clock. His heart rate spiked again. He'd overslept. Jack threw the covers aside. Goddammit. He was going to be late. Why hadn't Amber woken him up? Then, as he swung his legs out of bed, it struck him. He'd kept his early appointment at the lab a secret, just as Everett Reeves had asked. Amber hadn't come in to wake him because, as far as she was concerned, he wasn't due to get up for another half hour. Great. Another thing to feel guilty about. His engineering scrubs were where he'd left them – in a messy pile on top of the bedroom's dresser. He quickly stuffed his arms and legs inside the dirty uniform. There wouldn't be time for a shower. Still, he hurried into their tiny bathroom and splashed cold water over his face just the same. He looked tired and gaunt under the stark, pale light of the mirror. It didn't matter. He had much more important things to worry about than his appearance. A pair of rectangular devices no bigger than a matchbox sat in the crevice of the metal sink. Each had a thumb-groove in its top. Amber's was already speckled with blood, much to Jack's relief. He knew she didn't like taking the test. He pressed his thumb onto the other one, flinching as a microscopic needle pierced the skin. He sucked his thumb as he waited for the result. A second later, the light on the front of the device flashed green. Hurrah. No radiation poisoning this time. He left the bathroom and barged into the only other room in the apartment – a cramped chimera serving simultaneously as kitchen, living room and dining room. \"Look who's awake,\" said a bright voice as he entered. Amber was sat at the kitchen counter in her periwinkle blue dressing gown, scrolling through the day's news on her cracked data pad with one hand and eating her sloppy breakfast gruel with the other. Her chestnut hair tumbled to her shoulders. Her bare feet tapped what would have been a pleasant rhythm against the metal footrest of her stool, under less stressful circumstances. He hurried past her towards the coffee machine. \"You're up early,\" she said, not looking up. \"Something the matter?\" \"No. Got to pull a longer shift, that's all.\" She put down her tablet and spun around to face him. \"Another bad dream, huh?\" He paused and sighed, keeping his back to her. \"Yes,\" he said, reaching for a mug in an overhead cupboard. \"Same one as always.” Their decrepit chrome coffee machine was shaped like a bug's head, with transparent domes full of rotating wheels of coffee pods where the insect's eyes would be. Jack stuck his mug beneath the drip feed and turned it on. There was a whirring sound as a mechanical arm moved Jack's chosen pod into place. Then the whirring was replaced by a clanking noise, and milky brown liquid dribbled out over the kitchen counter. \"This damn coffee machine.\" Jack clenched his fists. \"I swear, one day I'll…\" \"Okay.\" Amber got up from her stool and hugged him from behind. His worries remained, but some of the tension slipped away. \"There's something else bothering you. What is it?\" Jack was glad Amber couldn't see his face. He hated keeping secrets from her. That's why he never did. He once ruined a surprise birthday party because hiding it from her had felt too great a betrayal. But he didn't keep quiet about the experiment because that's what Reeves and his non-disclosure agreement had told him to do. He would have happily spilled Britain's military secrets to his wife without so much as a second thought. No, he did it because he knew what she would say if he told her. She'd tell him it was too dangerous, too reckless, that it wasn't worth putting himself in harm's way just for a silly pair of Ark tickets. And she'd convince him to back out of it, too. He'd turn up to the pit as if it were any other day, saying nothing to nobody, and for that day at least, he'd be safe. But one day he wouldn't be safe. One day he'd get sick, and so would she. He couldn't let that happen. \"I just wish I could get us tickets away from this cursed place.\" He turned around to face her, clutching her tight. \"I work on those ships each and every night, yet there'll come a day when they leave us behind. And I can't…\" He lowered his eyes from hers. \"I can't help feeling as if it's my fault.\" \"Hey. We've talked about this.\" She hooked a finger under his chin and lifted his head back up. \"You can't keep beating yourself up over something outside of your control. How were you supposed to know what would happen?\" \"Oh, come on. The other kids at the academy weren't any the wiser, but they stuck with it. Now they have a future, and we don't.\" She looked up at him with a sweet, apologetic face. He shook his head. \"God, we were so young. We still are! If you hadn't married me, maybe—\" Amber jerked away from him, eyebrows raised. \"Do you regret it?\" \"No!\" His face fell, aghast. \"No. Of course not. I just mean—\" \"You just mean I might have met somebody better,\" she replied, breaking into a smirk. He relaxed. She was only having him on. \"Somebody who could sweep me off my feet… off my feet and away to the stars.\" Jack couldn't help but break into a smile as well. \"Yeah, something like that.\" \"You're an idiot, Jack.\" She hugged him close again. \"But you're my idiot. If I had the chance to do it all again, I would. Exactly the same.\" \"Really?\" \"Really. And will you please stop trying to be my knight in shining armour? Maybe I should have tried harder to make something of myself. Did you ever think of that?\" Jack made an incredulous noise. \"You did try hard. You're a nurse.\" \"And apparently that's still not enough.\" She rested her head against his chest. \"If we're stuck here, then we're stuck here. And you know what? That's okay. I'd rather we do our part and humanity go on to survive elsewhere than for nobody to survive at all. So long as we're together, that's all that matters.\" \"You're too good for me, you know that?\" \"Yes, I do.\" She pulled away from him. \"But you've got a good heart, Jack. You're always trying to do the right thing. That's what I love about you. Now get going, before you really are late.\" Jack gave her a kiss. Amber followed him to the other side of the room, where his satchel lay strewn across an old wooden table covered in scuff marks. \"Hang on a second,\" said Jack, slinging the bag over his shoulder. \"Why aren't you dressed yet? Aren't you heading to the med tent today?\" Amber shook her head. \"Woke up feeling a bit queasy, so going to call in sick,\" she said, offering him a dry smile. \"It's no biggie.\" \"Will they manage without you?\" \"They'll have to,\" she said, leaning against the doorframe. \"I reckon I've earned it after all that overtime I did covering Lucy's shifts last month.\" \"You checked your blood this morning, right?\" Jack's voice turned cold. Suddenly he felt pretty nauseous himself. \"If it's radiation poisoning, we need…\" \"It's not radiation.\" Amber rolled her eyes. \"I'm fine. Now get moving. Think of me while you're out there saving the world.\" Jack relaxed. Nodding, he made for the front door. \"All right. Get some rest, you hear?\" \"Yes sir.\" She gave him a mock salute. \"Oh, can you pick up dinner tonight?\" \"Sure. What would you like me to get? Sloppy mush, or mushy slop?\" \"Oh, definitely the latter.\" \"I'll see what I can do.\" He paused, his hand on the latch. He turned back to Amber. She was leaning against the table, watching him go. His stomach tied itself into a knot. This was his last chance to tell her the truth. \"I love you more than anything. You know that, right?\" She smiled quizzically. \"Of course I do, Jack. I love you too.\" He unlocked the door and went to work. Had he known then where that work would take him, he never would have left.",

      "title": "Everett’s Experiment",
      "content": "3 Everett’s Experiment Jack sat anxiously on the cold metal bench and watched as a technician by the name of Stone vacuum-sealed the arm of his spacesuit. Or what looked like a spacesuit, at least. It slotted into place with a dull click. \"Is all this really necessary?\" Jack wiggled his fingers. The glove was surprisingly flexible. \"I'm going into a test chamber, not into orbit.\" Stone twisted the other arm into place. \"Without this suit, you'll be dead within twenty seconds.\" He noticed Jack's expression. \"Don't be alarmed – it's no different than those special G-suits you would have worn back at the academy. No way of surviving sustained high-G's without it. Plus it allows us to monitor your vital signs throughout the experiment. It's actually a modified version of what the astronauts who first went to Mars wore.\" \"Well I won't say it isn't comfortable, in a bulky sort of way,\" said Jack, tapping the hard carapace covering his torso. \"I suppose I should be grateful it isn't the suit they used for the Moon landing.\" Stone smiled politely and then retrieved the helmet from the top shelf of a locker. The back half was solid, the front transparent. It wasn't quite as round as a beachball, but it wasn't far off either. \"Seriously?\" asked Jack. \"Seriously,\" confirmed Stone, lowering the helmet. \"You're not much use to us if we can't monitor your damn head. Besides, it'll keep the pressure from shutting your eyes. You'll need to tell us what you see.\" Stone attached the helmet to the body of Jack's suit. Sound became a little muted… but not as much as Jack expected. \"Okay, you're all set.\" Stone stepped away from the bench. \"How does it feel?\" Jack rose to his feet and took a quick walk around the lockers and shelves of the Preparation Room. Just like the gloves, the whole suit was remarkably mobile. \"Turning my head will take a bit of getting used to.\" He shot Stone a thumbs-up. \"Otherwise all good.\" \"Good to hear. Head on through those doors there – they're ready for you.\" Jack crossed the room, then paused. He turned around and pointed at his engineering uniform folded in a neat pile on the bench. \"Hey, could you grab the wallet out from my pocket?\" Stone looked confused, but did as Jack asked. He fished out a battered, old leather wallet and tossed it over. Jack flipped it open and pulled out a piece of paper. It was folded over on itself. The edges were worn and flimsy, and the creases looked very white. A small compartment was built into the front of his spacesuit, just above his heart. Jack prised it open and tucked the photograph inside. He'd been advised not to wear his wedding ring during the experiment, so a memento of Amber would have to do. \"Old school romantic, eh?\" Stone caught Jack's wallet as he tossed it back. \"Go on, now. Get going before they have to call through.\" \"Don't let me forget this later,\" said Jack, tapping the compartment. He approached the large pair of metal doors at the end of the room, took a deep breath, and pushed them open. He emerged into the same laboratory hall as before. This time, however, the bulbs that hung from the high ceiling were much brighter, and the smell of burnt electronics had been replaced with that of sterilising bleach. Only a few of the two dozen scientists glanced up from their computer terminals as he entered. The mysterious machine stood in the centre. Jack's heart fluttered as he walked towards its dome. He had no idea what to expect inside. Gas? Gamma radiation? Panic gnawed in his chest like a hungry rat. This was a mistake. A big mistake. He turned around and abruptly found Everett Reeves on the other side of his helmet. The man looked agitated. The bags under his eyes gave Jack the impression he hadn't slept since their last meeting. \"Jack! You're ready. Good. Everything fit okay?\" \"Erm, yes. I think so. Look, Mr. Reeves…\" \"Call me Everett.\" He put an arm around Jack's shoulders and guided him back towards the machine. \"Come on, let's get you—\" Jack stopped sharp. \"What is this thing?\" He wrung his gloved hands together. \"Can you at least tell me what I've gone and signed myself up for?\" Everett's face fell in utter bafflement. Then he broke into nervous laughter. A couple of scientists glanced up again. \"Oh, of course! You have no idea, do you?\" Jack shook his head. The helmet made it harder than it should have been. Everett got off to a couple of false starts trying to explain, then resignedly led Jack to a nearby desk. He snatched up a piece of paper. \"Here's where Earth is, yes?\" Holding it landscape, Everett drew a dot on one end of the paper. \"And this is where the nearest habitable star system is.\" He drew a second dot close to the opposite end. \"Even at half the speed of light, to get from here to there would take a dozen lifetimes.\" \"So you're putting people into stasis?\" \"What? No! The survival rate amongst cryochamber test subjects is still woefully unsatisfactory, and besides – we don't have the power to sustain a ship for that long a journey, let alone one filled with three hundred thousand frozen coffins.\" Jack furrowed his brow. \"But if the Arks don't have the power to travel those sorts of distances, then how…\" \"How can we make the trip at all?\" Everett grinned. \"By taking a shortcut. Watch.\" He folded the paper in half, then pierced the tip of his pencil through both of the dots he'd drawn. \"We punch a hole through spacetime. With the right coordinates and calculations, the trip should be almost instantaneous.\" Jack felt as if he'd been dunked in ice water. His whole body turned numb. \"A wormhole.\" The words spilled out flat and monotone. \"You're talking about using a wormhole.\" \"Not using one, Jack. Making one. We've done it before.\" Everett pointed at the machine. \"This is one half of a pair. The other sits in a secondary lab about a mile or so down the runway.\" Everett waited for Jack to put the pieces together himself. He sighed and gave up. \"We're going to send you from one chamber to the other,\" he explained. Jack blinked at Everett as if he hadn't heard a word he'd said. Then he started frantically pulling at his helmet. \"Nope, definitely not.\" Try as he might, he couldn't twist it off. He started tugging at his gloves instead. \"I'm out.\" \"What? What do you mean, you're out?\" \"I thought you needed somebody to undergo the conditions of interstellar acceleration, or something. You know, pilot things. If I'd known you were going to bloody teleport me about, I never would have volunteered.\" \"Not teleporting.\" Everett grabbed Jack by the shoulders and lowered his voice. \"Bending spacetime. There's a difference. Don't do this to me, Jack. I took a chance on you. If you leave now, they'll shut down the project for sure.\" \"They?\" \"Look up there.\" Jack squinted past the glare of the bulbs. A large window stuck out from the far wall, sort of like the box at a baseball game. Half a dozen old men in black suits looked down at them from their seats. Each appeared deeply unimpressed by the delay. Standing by their side was Captain Blatch. She didn't look particularly happy about it either. \"Do you really think I'm going to let anything go wrong while they're watching? Come on, Jack. If we don't do this, nobody's getting off this planet.\" Jack looked around the lab. All the scientists were watching him from their computer stations, waiting to begin. \"I don't know…\" \"Yes you do. You want tickets for you and your wife?\" Everett gave a subtle nod in the direction of the men in suits. \"This is the only way to get them. They'll do anything to honour a hero. Trust me.\" Jack chewed his bottom lip. His skin felt like it was burning. All he wanted to do was run away, and yet… \"Okay. Answer me one question. What happened to the other pilots?\" Everett was taken aback. He looked almost angry in his confusion. Then his expression softened again. \"Oh, them. They're fine. A little shaken up, as one would expect, but fine. The test is perfectly safe, Jack. It's just a case of scaling up, from a mouse to a person to an intergalactic supercarrier. Hell, I'd do it myself if they'd let me.\" He dropped his voice to a whisper again. \"If you leave and they pull my budget, I'll probably have to.\" Jack closed his eyes, sighed, and nodded. \"All right. Let's get this over with.\" Everett clapped his hands together with glee. \"Okay, we're good to go! Everybody to their positions!\" As Everett guided Jack back towards the machine, the rest of the scientists hurried from computer to computer. Two men in hazmat suits rolled out a couple of large, metal barrels and plugged them into panels at the machine's base. The door of the dome had been opened for him, and a wheeled set of stairs positioned in front of it. All he felt like doing was throwing up, but Jack didn't permit himself to hesitate. He climbed the stairs and stepped inside the chamber. It was empty, save for a single leather pilot's chair in the centre. Unlike a cockpit there were no dials or dashboards of any kind. The hexagonal panels on the curved wall mirrored those on the outside of the dome, though these were plagued with dozens of bulbous Tesla coils. Transparent pipes ran along the chamber floor. He sat in the chair. It seemed expected of him. Everett followed him inside and took the opportunity to conduct one final inspection of the chamber. \"How will you know if something goes wrong?\" asked Jack. \"Is there a way I can get hold of anyone?\" \"The suit will be feeding us your vitals the whole time, and we'll be keeping an eye on you through this camera,\" Everett pointed at a tiny black speck on the panel directly in front of Jack, then slapped him on the arm. \"Don't worry, Jack. You're perfectly safe. Just, erm, try not to wriggle about too much.\" Jack let out a nervous laugh. Everett shot his colleagues a thumbs up. \"We'll shut the chamber door, and then you'll have a minute or so before we start her up,\" said Everett, hovering in the doorway. \"Good luck.\" The metal door swung shut with a cold clang. Through its tiny slit of a window, Jack could see assistants pulling the stairs away. He faced the wall of the chamber in front of him and tried to control his breathing. Everything was going to be fine. They wouldn't be running the experiment if they didn't expect it to succeed, right? All he had to do was sit still and try not to pass out. He reached into the compartment on the chest of his suit and pulled out the piece of paper. Unfolding it was a delicate process, especially given the gloves he was wearing. It was a photograph of him and Amber. They'd taken it during a trip along Oregon's coastline not long after he'd left the academy, a couple of years before the first solar flare had hit. The way the sunset mist crept over the sea-swept cliffs behind them was beautiful. They both looked so young. They both looked so happy. He smiled to himself, then carefully folded it up and stuffed it away again. Remember who you're doing this for. A few seconds later, a green light went on above his head. He looked up as far as his helmet would allow. \"Here we go,\" he said, clenching his fists. He glanced through the small window and saw Everett shouting something to his colleague. Nothing bad, Jack hoped. Then Everett pressed a button on his console and the whole noisy mechanism jolted into life. The chamber started to hum – Jack could feel the vibrations through the seat of his chair. Slowly, as if brought to life by an emergency generator during a power cut, the coils all around the dome began to glow. Jack gripped the arms of his seat. It was tempting to shut his eyes and wait the test out, but he forced himself to watch. They wanted to know what he saw as he shot from one lab to another, and he intended to tell them. He jumped as a bolt of blue electricity crackled from one node to another. Perfectly normal, he was sure. He glanced out the slit of a window again. Everett didn't seem to be panicking, at least. As the static charges increased in regularity, Jack discovered a growing pressure on his chest. He'd wondered why the chair hadn't come with seatbelts. Now he had his answer. Against the forces this experiment would apply, he wouldn't need them. The humming noise grew louder. An electric hiss rose in volume alongside it. Jack tried to look at the scientists through the window again, but the bolts of lightning had grown so frequent that they almost appeared to form an electric cage around him. \"Guys?\" The words croaked out in a wheeze. \"Is this supposed to happen?\" He didn't know if anyone could hear him, but nobody answered. Now it felt as if a large man had sat on his chest. It was getting hard to breathe. Even raising his arm from the side of his chair was an ordeal. The inside of the chamber was growing more bleak and monochrome as his vision started to grey-out… not that it had been all that colourful to begin with. Jack couldn't hear much besides the chamber's mechanical humming sound. He certainly couldn't make out the voices of anybody outside in the hall. And yet he could hear the sudden gurgle of liquid behind him as clearly as if he were lying under the pipes of his kitchen sink. He tried to look around but the pressure was too great. He needn't have bothered. Whatever liquid being pumped into the machine now flowed through the pipes that ran along the chamber's floor. It was as sluggish and black as tar. He tried to call out again, but this time only a pained groan escaped his lips. The man who'd been sitting on his chest had got up and allowed a bull elephant to take his place. And still the machine grew in power. The periphery of his vision was darkening now. All he could see were the blurry flashes of blue electricity in front of him and the horrid blackness inside the pipes by his feet. How were they doing this? Had he ever gone this fast in any of his centrifuge tests? He knew that pretty soon he would lose his sense of sight entirely, and pass out after that. If they didn't stop the experiment at that point, he would die. He didn't want to die. He just wanted to go back home to Amber, even if it meant losing his job. Even if it meant dooming them both to a life on a dying planet. Something rattled loose from the chamber wall and ricocheted off Jack's shoulder. Jack stared wide-eyed, suddenly alert again. He could have sworn it had been a rivet or a bolt of some kind. But that was impossible. That would mean the machine was tearing itself apart. Another bolt came loose and hit his helmet, scratching the visor. This time Jack had no doubt as to what it was… for the most part because it remained motionless in front of him, floating as if in zero G. Then it shot past him into the back of the chamber. That was when all hell started to break loose. Rivet after rivet tore through the dome, punching holes through the metal panels all around him. Jack winced but the pressure kept him locked in place. A couple pieces of shrapnel bounced off his suit. It stung, but they didn't rip the fabric. One of the pipes shook itself loose, spraying the thick, black fluid over his boots. It looked toxic. The door rattled and its window smashed. Luckily for Jack, the glass burst outwards. Then the whole door flew off its hinges with a terrible screech. Jack expected to see something on the other side – even if only a nauseating blur – but there was nothing outside the chamber except white-hot nothingness. The threads of Jack's chair began to split. \"Why won't…\" he whimpered, blinking a tear free. \"Stop…\" A metal panel in front of him started to wrench itself away from the chamber wall, buckling as easily as one might turn the corner of a page. Behind it were all manner of complicated wires and tubes, most of which were broken and sparking. Jack hoped the liquid at his feet wasn't flammable. Horrifying images of the Apollo 1 fire rose in his mind. The panel lurched further free. Its jagged edge looked like the serrated teeth of a chainsaw. One of the tubes behind it flew out and exploded against the side wall. And still the pressure grew greater… And greater… And… The world turned mute, and Jack was thrown forwards. * * * After a while, when it became apparent he hadn't been cleaved in two, Jack opened his eyes. The chamber was gone. The entire machine was gone. So was the laboratory, and the scientists, and the viewing box full of men in suits. In their place was… nothing. Well, that wasn't strictly true. As his tunnel-vision retreated and the pain in his chest subsided, the darkness before Jack grew less absolute and more… beautiful. It was as if somebody had taken a black sheet and pricked a hundred thousand tiny holes in it, and through those holes shone beads of brilliant light, some much greater than others. And all around them bloomed great clouds of dust in deep pastels – blues and reds and greens – a tapestry wrapped around him, yet infinitely out of reach. The laboratory was gone, and in its place was everything. \"No, no, no,\" muttered Jack, as reality kicked in. His heart rate skyrocketed and his breathing, already laboured from the experiment, became sharp and erratic. \"This cannot be happening, this can not be happening…\" Wide eyed, he looked everywhere his bulky helmet would allow. He saw nothing except more empty space. He tried to turn around, but his arms and legs flailed through a vacuum. There was nothing to hold on to. All he could do was float, adrift. Earth was nowhere to be seen. He started to hyperventilate. His visor fogged up. No Earth, no Moon. No satellites or space stations. He was getting pains in his chest. Panic attack? Heart attack? He tried to remember the constellations his father had taught him as a child. Maybe he could get his bearings that way. No luck there either. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. Of course. No oxygen, save for what was trapped in his suit. In a few minutes only carbon dioxide would be left. He was going to suffocate, alone. Once more, his vision grew dark at the edges. His temples throbbed and his lungs ached. The stars blurred and ran into one another. He tried to scream, but nothing came out. As he lost consciousness, his thoughts were of Amber. Moments later, a huge shadow passed overhead. It lingered above him, blotting out the nebulas beyond. Something reached out.",

      "content": "4 The Automata Jack woke up on his back, gasping for air. He clawed at his helmet only to discover that it wasn't there anymore. Wherever he was, there was oxygen. His breathing steadied, as did his heartbeat. He was alive, he guessed. His body felt like it had gone a few rounds against a grizzly bear, but he was alive. How was that even possible? For the first time since gaining consciousness, he paid proper attention to the ceiling above him. It looked like the bulkhead of an ancient submarine. Sheets of copper metal had been welded to iron girders and punched together with rivets the size of Jack's fist. It was a clumsy job. There were spots of what looked like rust. He shivered. Even in the suit, he was freezing. A cold mist floated up from his mouth each time he exhaled. Something bulky and metallic leaned over him. \"Hey, guys?\" it said. \"Get over here. He's awake.\" Jack screamed and scampered across the floor on his backside until he hit a wall. His eyes were wide and his legs trembled. He held out his hands in self-defence. Half a dozen figures watched him from across what looked like a cargo bay. A couple of them were approaching, cautiously, as if he were a wild cat that had escaped its cage. They were humanoid in general appearance, and in the way that they moved, but… …but they were anything but human. They walked with gears that ground together and pistons that pumped up and down. Their metal feet clanged heavily against the floor. Some of them had mechanical hands that resembled those of a human, complete with flexing fingers and thumb. Some had mere clamps and claws. Their bodies were as industrial as the ship, though some looked better maintained than others. They studied him with eyes made of lenses and LEDs. Jack waved his hands back and forth. \"Keep away from me!\" he shouted. \"I'm warning you!\" One of the robots came closer than the others. It shook a sad, elongated head, which was attached to a thin torso by a trio of long metal rods. \"See? He's just like all the rest of them,\" it said. \"I told you we should have left him out there.\" \"Don't be ridiculous,\" said the one that had first leaned over him. He was smaller than the others – three feet tall, perhaps – and stockier, with a head that protruded from his otherwise box-shaped torso like a VHS cassette tape. \"We're not animals. Besides, it’s Ministry protocol.\" A third joined them. This one was about Jack's height and had a faceplate that actually resembled a face – albeit one forged in a foundry, not a womb. A tight bunch of cables flowed out from the rear of her head like snakes and re-entered at the small of her back. She looked more advanced than the rest of her companions. \"He's not dangerous,\" she said, the apertures of her eyes contracting as she squinted at him. \"He's just scared.\" The short one tilted his head. \"We found you floating about outside.” He pronounced each word as if Jack were a child. \"We aren't going to hurt you.\" Jack studied them, his mouth agape. He didn't lower his arms. \"What the hell are you?\" he asked. The grumpy one laughed and shook its head again. It was the most human-looking one who answered. \"We're automata.\" She squatted down to his level. \"Mostly construction and engineering models, though some of us have backgrounds in personal assistance.\" \"This is ridiculous,\" sneered the grumpy robot. \"Of course he knows what we are. He's a fleshy – he's probably got a few of us slaving away for him back home.\" \"I most certainly do not,\" said Jack, running a hand through his hair. \"You're… you're robots! You don't even exist!\" The grumpy robot made a sound like a floppy drive being processed. \"That's rich, coming from you. We ran your DNA through the system. There's no record of your kind anywhere in the galaxy. The real question is: what are you?\" \"I thought you might be a Kerulian,\" said the small one, \"but you don't have the bony ridges along your head and neck like they do. Or their yellow-green eyes.\" They all stared at him, waiting. \"I'm a human,\" said Jack. \"Never heard of them,\" said the grumpy robot. \"Sounds made up.\" \"An unregistered, semi-intelligent species.” The small automata was in awe. \"I didn't think there were any left to find! How did you end up all the way out here?\" \"There was an experiment, and…\" Jack trailed off, his brow furrowed. \"Something went wrong. I don't know, exactly. Wait a second. If you've never heard of a human before, how come you're speaking English?\" \"We're not,\" replied the android with a face. \"We're speaking Binary.\" \"Well, how come I understand that?\" \"Because of the language nano-chip we implanted in your neck, of course.\" Jack scrambled to reach the base of his neck. True enough, there was a microscopic lump on one of the upper notches of his spine. It burned at his touch, and when he looked at his fingers they were speckled with blood. \"What's wrong with you?\" he yelled, getting to his feet. \"What the hell have you done to me?\" \"Oh, calm down,\" she replied. \"Every child across the galaxy gets this done. You won't get very far without it – not unless you plan to learn a few hundred thousand languages any time soon.\" \"A few hundred… Why on earth do you guys need so many?\" The three robots looked at one another. \"Bless him.” The small one tilted his cassette-head. \"He really has no idea.\" \"Without that chip, all you'd hear from us would be a long series of beeps,\" she continued. \"The chip translates them into whichever language your brain best understands. It can help you recognise some written communication, too… though that tends to take a little getting used to. You were talking in your sleep. That’s why we could get the translation process started. Sorry if it took you by surprise, but it really is standard procedure.\" She stepped closer. Jack backed away. \"Look,\" said the grumpy robot. \"We saved your life. We didn't have to. Either you settle down or we kick you back out into space again. Your choice.\" Jack stared at the three bizarre, mechanical figures in front of him, then at the various faceless synthetic creatures peering out from behind the metal walls and cargo crates. As strange as they all were, as insane as the situation was, they didn't look hostile. If anything, they looked more scared of him. He took a deep breath and held out a trembling hand. \"Thank you, I guess. I'm Jack Bishop.\" The android with a face studied Jack's hand, then gingerly clasped it in her own. It was cold, but gentle. \"And I'm RX-1150,\" she replied. She pointed at the small robot. \"This is IL-6-88, who found you on the scans. And this is 11-P-53, our captain of sorts.\" 11-P-53 – the grumpy robot – gave Jack a curt nod and marched off in the other direction. \"This captain needs to make sure the two of you haven't put all of us at risk,\" it said, disappearing around the corner. A lot of the curious robots followed. \"Don't mind 11-P-53,\" said the small robot. \"It's under a lot of pressure at the moment.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Jack. \"Don't any of you automata have actual names? I'm going to struggle remembering all these numbers.\" \"We just told you them.\" The android shrugged. \"I'm RX-1150 and this is IL-6-88.\" \"That's not a name. That's a barcode.\" \"That's all we have,\" said a disappointed IL-6-88. \"I have been analysing your language since before you gained consciousness,\" said the android, pointing at her head. \"I believe I could generate a name based on your most popular words, if that would be preferable?\" \"Go for it,\" said Jack, rubbing his neck again. RX-1150's lenses glazed over for a couple of seconds while she came up with something. \"Josh Rogan,\" she said. \"Erm, I'm pretty sure that's a curry…\" \"Oh, that's good!\" IL-6-88 prodded RX-1150 on the arm. \"Give me one!\" She took a moment to generate another name. \"Tuna Melt,\" she announced. \"Okay, I'm not sure you've quite got the hang of names yet,\" said Jack, interrupting IL-6-88's excitement. \"How about this: you're Rogan, and you're Tuner. How does that sound?\" \"Do the captain next!\" said Tuner, his lights flashing. \"I'm not sure 11-P-53 would like that,\" replied Rogan. \"Besides, Jack Bishop here can call him Captain if the numbers are too tricky.\" \"Just Jack is fine, thanks,\" said Jack, wincing. His head was killing him. He lost his balance and staggered sideways. \"Woah there,\" said Tuner, catching him. To Jack, it felt like hugging a filing cabinet. \"You sure you're okay?\" \"Of course he isn't,\" said Rogan, helping to steady him. \"His body's having trouble adjusting to the lack of atmosphere. I'm not surprised, given the state we found him in. It sounds like the poor guy's had quite an ordeal.\" \"You don't know the half of it,\" sighed Jack, still not quite believing he was talking to a pair of robots. \"I should be dead. Am I dead?\" \"Well you look it, if that's any consolation,\" said Tuner. \"Let's take him to one of the quarters, let him have a lie down.\" \"I'm fine, honestly,\" said Jack, but he let them escort him out of the cargo bay all the same. They walked down a corridor that was almost entirely circular, aside from the flat platform on which they walked. Everything was built from the same clunky, rusty metal Jack had seen in the cargo bay. It was dim – there were no windows and the only light came from the occasional orb embedded in the curved ceiling. The walls were covered in exposed pipes and cables and maintenance hatches. Every now and then a jet of steam would hiss out from overhead. The air smelled of copper and oil. \"Is this your ship?\" asked Jack. \"Yes,\" replied Tuner. \"Isn't she great? We wouldn't be here without her.\" \"She's wonderful,\" said Jack, staring at everything they passed. He was struck by an unnerving thought. \"How come I'm able to breathe if everyone on this ship is a robot?\" \"Automata,\" Rogan corrected him. \"We turned on some of the life support systems when we realised you were a fleshy. Good thing we got it right and didn't flood the ship with methane. The ship was originally built with carbon-based beings in mind. That's why it has sleeping quarters.\" \"Don't any of the automata sleep?\" Jack asked. \"Some of our older models shut down from time to time in order to conserve power,\" said Tuner, \"but no, we don't sleep. And we certainly don't need bunks.\" \"Amazing. So I suppose I have you to thank for me still being alive, huh?\" \"Yes,\" said Rogan. \"IL-6-88 – Tuner, I mean – was monitoring the scans when you popped up.\" \"One minute we were flying through empty subspace,\" said Tuner, \"and then bam – a little blip out of nowhere. It took some work convincing 11-P-53 to pull over. How come you were out there, anyway? You never said.\" \"Some sort of wormhole experiment, I think. I was only supposed to go from one laboratory to another, but I guess something went wrong. Or right.\" \"Wormhole tech?\" Rogan shook her head. \"Messy business. Good way to get yourself turned inside out.\" \"You don't recommend it?\" \"Good grief, no. Any old Somnium-fueled skip drive will do the trick, providing you've got a clear subspace route ahead of you. Turn right here.\" \"I'll pretend like I understood a single word you just said,\" said Jack, stepping through a round opening roughly the size and shape of a bank vault's doorway. A bunch of automata watched from the top of the dark, industrial staircase beyond. They scarpered as he approached. \"Don't worry about them,\" said Tuner, as the three of them climbed the stairs. He took a little longer than Jack and Rogan on account of his small legs. \"Some of us automata are just a little… well, wary about fleshies. Particularly ones we've never seen before.\" Reaching the top first, Jack peered into a small room on the right. Three small, gangly robots stood huddled inside what appeared to be a storage closet. They shut the door in a hurry. \"Don't take it personally.\" Tuner caught up. \"Here you are. Next door on the left.\" They arrived at a set of magnetically-locked doors. There were three more just like it further along the corridor – if that was all the crew quarters there were, he guessed it wasn't all too big a ship. There was another staircase on the other side, most likely leading down to a corridor that ran parallel to the one along which they’d just walked. Presuming that the rear of the ship wasn’t too much further back, Jack’s best guess put it about about fifteen metres wide and forty, maybe fifty metres long. Some sort of digital interface extended from Tuner's hand – it looked like a tiny, wiry USB stick. He plugged it into the keypad beside the door, and a second later the door hissed open. \"In you go.\" Rogan gestured for Jack to head inside. \"Get some rest. We'll talk more once you're feeling better.\" Jack hesitated before going in. \"Are you going to lock me in there?\" Rogan and Tuner looked mortified. Well, Rogan did. The lights of Tuner's LED eyes turned from yellow to blue. \"Of course not,\" said Tuner. \"You're welcome to come out any time you like. Just don't go wandering about the ship too much – I'm afraid you might give some of our passengers a bit of a fright. We'll be up at the cockpit when you're ready.\" He pointed down the upper floor's only other corridor, which lead back towards the front of the ship. Rogan was already making her way over there. \"Okay.\" Jack stepped through the door, but he kept an eye on the two robots even as they walked away. \"Erm… thanks, again.\" The door hissed shut. Jack turned around, alone at last. His quarters were sparse, and the walls just as metal as everywhere else. It didn't look as if anyone had occupied them in quite some time. The only items of furniture were a storage chest, a rudimentary closet – upon inspection Jack found both of these empty – and a simple, coverless bunk. He gave the mattress a cautious prod. It felt quite soft, at least. There wasn’t a toilet. He would have to ask that Rogan robot what he should do if he ever needed the bathroom. Given the nature of his hosts, he wasn't confident she'd have an answer. He hoped there was one elsewhere on board. He turned away from the bunk, and his cold breath caught in his throat. He'd somehow missed the window in his initial sweep of the room. It wasn't a large one, in all fairness – not much bigger than a porthole on an old cruise liner. But the sight of the cosmos outside was enough to still Jack’s heart and send a panicked shiver through his bones. The horror of floating out there, alone and without hope of rescue, was still a little too fresh in his mind. A chair was bolted to the floor beside it. Jack sat down and gave the glass of the window a nervous tap with his knuckles. He was relieved to discover it was very, very thick. There was no denying how beautiful the universe looked. There'd always been too much light pollution back home to see anything except for the brightest stars in the night sky, and even then they were but salt crystals compared to the glistening diamonds now scattered out before him. As black and dark and empty as space was, he'd never seen it look so… colourful. Or so full. He jumped as a loud crackling noise burst through the ship. \"Reactivating the skip drive in T-minus thirty seconds,\" said a voice through the intercom. It sounded like the captain, 11-P-53. \"You might want to strap in. That means you, human.\" Jack stared around, wide-eyed. A couple of straps dangled down from the shoulders of his seat. A two-headed metal buckle protruded from the seat between his legs. He grabbed one of the belts and tugged it across his chest. It reached the buckle easily, but he struggled to lock them together. His fingers were shaking too much. Fresh sweat ran into his eyes. He heard the belt click into place and moved onto the second one. This one gave him less trouble. He leaned back against the chair and sucked in quick, sharp breaths. His chest heaved up and down. \"Not again,\" he groaned, shutting his eyes and squeezing the straps tight. \"For the love of God, not again.\" The thrusters roared into life – he could feel their rage reverberate through every rusty bolt in the ship. Jack was pushed abruptly back into the soft padding of his seat as if he were taking off in a fighter jet. He imagined the sheets of metal ripping away from the ship just as the panels had disintegrated from the cabin of the chamber. He imagined the glass smashing, the floor buckling, the shrapnel tearing through him like a hundred machine gun rounds. The pressure on his chest grew. He gritted his teeth and let out a little scream. And then as quickly as it began, it stopped. Jack opened his eyes and looked out the window. Outside was… nothing. Well, almost nothing. Intermittent pulses of deep blue light rushed by the ship as it sailed through an ocean of pure blackness. There were no stars, no planets, no nebulas. If he pressed his head as hard against the window as he dared, Jack could just make out the dim glow of something bright far ahead of the ship – like the blinding light at the end of a tunnel. They were travelling faster than the speed of light, and it was magnificent. \"If only you could see this, Amber,\" he said in a near breathless whisper. He reached into the compartment on the front of his suit and pulled out the old photograph once more. It was as fragile as ever, but Jack was relieved to discover it hadn't been torn in the accident. He unfolded it. His heart sank. Amber. Where was she? Where was Earth, for that matter? The experiment could have sent him anywhere. Faced with all the wonders of the universe, all Jack wanted was to go back home.",

      "title": "The Adeona",
      "content": "5 The Adeona Sleep was never on the cards. For that, Jack was grateful. He didn't fancy waking from another nightmare… or into one. Lying down on the bunk for an hour or so had helped get rid of his headache, at least. And his chest no longer felt as if somebody had jumped up and down on it, which was an improvement. Now all he had to do was get ahold of his nerves and decide what he was going to do next. He ran his hands down his face and sighed. What was he going to do next? He still had trouble believing that he was out in space, let alone on some rickety rust-bucket with a crew of walking, talking machines. If and when he decided to leave his quarters, he half expected to find a psychiatric ward on the other side of the door. And yet even a cursory glance at the surges of blueshifted light outside the window told him that everything was exactly how it seemed. He pushed himself off the bed and, after a couple of anxious laps around the room, approached the door. He pressed the most conspicuous button on the keypad beside it, and the door hissed open. Jack looked both ways down the corridor outside. It was deserted. From down the stairs to his right came a steady clanging sound, like somebody hitting an engine with a wrench. The only sounds other than that were of pipes gurgling and steam hissing. He steadied his nerves and approached the corridor down which Rogan and Tuner had walked earlier. Something was happening down on the other end, though it was difficult to see what. If it was the cockpit or bridge he was looking at, then his estimations of the ship's size were likely correct. He could hear bleeping noises, but whether they were the voices of the automata or not he couldn't tell. Perhaps the translator chip they put in his neck had a volume threshold. Slowly, stepping lightly to dampen the noise made by his boots against the metal walkway, he made his way towards them. There were sliding metal doors to the left and right. He didn't try opening them – he wasn't sure he even knew how. Whomever the ship had been built for, he was sure they needed rooms for downtime and storing equipment. Light crept out from a doorway about halfway down. His heart rate climbing again, Jack poked his head through the opening. There was a counter, and an assortment of machines, and there were a lot of unlabelled crates piled up into mountains. There didn't seem to be anyone about. \"Hello?\" On the counter, an object not much bigger than (or different in shape from) a cookie jar jumped into life. It whizzed back and forth along the surface on its tank tracks, looking for a place to hide. \"Wait!\" Jack inched into the room. \"It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.\" The tiny automata paused and studied Jack with its dozens of curious lights. They flashed in a ring around the top of its cylindrical head. \"So, what is this room?\" asked Jack, looking around. \"Some sort of kitchen or pantry? I wouldn't have guessed you guys needed to eat.\" The robot let out a couple of nervous bleeps. \"We don't,\" it said in a timid little voice, \"though sometimes we need new oil. It helps with the joints.\" It wiggled one of its tank tracks around. \"All this food is left over from the ship's previous owners.\" \"I see.\" Jack dug through one of the crates. He found something brown, round and furry. He wasn't sure if it was a fruit or a grenade. \"Anything I'd like? I haven't eaten anything all day.\" A door opened in the automata's side, and from inside unfolded a long, metal arm. It plucked a tin free from a stack beside the counter. A second door then opened and out came a shorter limb, this one sporting a small laser torch on its end. It cut the lid off and held the open tin out towards Jack. \"Give it a try,\" it said. Jack took the can and studied its contents. It was full of cubes of unidentifiable meat. There was a murky brown liquid sloshing between them, which didn't do much to help Jack’s appetite. \"So what's your number, then?\" he asked, using his fingers to pick out the smallest cube he could find. \"Fair warning, though – I can't promise I'll remember it if it's more than four digits long.” The robot wheeled itself closer to the edge of the counter. \"I heard IL-6-88 call himself Tuner,\" it said, quietly. \"Said you helped give it to him. Can you give me a name?\" Jack popped the cube into his mouth, then immediately spat it back out into the tin. It tasted like pork… if said pork had been left out under the summer sun for three weeks. There was a certain fluffiness to its texture. \"God, that's terrible,\" he said, trying to get the taste off his tongue. \"If you want a name, why don't you just come up with one?\" The little automata's lights flashed both ways round the ring at its top, from inside outwards. \"Don't know how,\" it replied. \"Okay,\" said Jack. \"Fair enough. How about…\" He looked around the pantry, and then down at the tin in his hand. Tin… no. Can… maybe… \"How about Kansas?\" he said, shrugging. The automata's eye-lights spun around extra fast. \"Kansas,\" it said. \"Hello, my name is Kansas. I love it!\" \"I thought it might be a little more interesting than Bob,\" said Jack, laughing as he put the rancid tin back down on the counter. He turned around, and almost had a heart attack. Rogan was standing in the doorway, watching them. \"Feeling better?\" she asked. \"Yeah, a little,\" replied Jack, catching his breath. \"Though after trying some of the food here, I may have spoken too soon.\" \"Yes, I fear that the produce on board is better suited to reptilian stomachs,\" she replied, nodding. \"Come on up to the bridge. There's something you should see.\" Rogan left the room. Jack turned back to Kansas. \"Erm… did she say 'reptilian'?\" He caught up with her just as they reached the end of the corridor. The large door ahead was now closed, but opened in three separate pieces as they approached. They stepped through and the door shut behind them. The bridge alone was bigger than some of the research vessels Jack had worked on in the pit. Down at the front was a curved dashboard of buttons and levers and panels, plus a few clunky monitors that looked as if they'd been borrowed from the 1980s – decades before Jack had even been born. Behind that, a few steps up, were more dashboards and electronic screens, these supervised by automata to whom Jack hadn't yet been introduced. In the centre of the bridge was a large table from which blue holograms flickered. Tuner waved at Jack from behind them. Jack waved back, but it was the windows that had his attention. They stretched out across the whole front of the cockpit and quite a way down the sides. At faster-than-light speeds there was still nothing much to see… except the single spot of blindingly bright light towards which they were headed. \"Ah, Jack Bishop.\" Captain 11-P-53 spun his seat around from the main dashboard up front. \"How generous of you to join us.\" \"This is incredible,\" said Jack, still staring out the windows. \"Yes, I suppose it is,\" replied Rogan, gently guiding him down the steps towards the front. \"But it's not what I wanted to show you. We're still a few minutes away from that. Take a seat.\" Near to the captain’s dashboard were four chairs similar to the one back in Jack's quarters. Tuner and Rogan sat together on one side of the steps. Jack sat in one on the other. \"Jack, meet Brackitt,\" said Tuner, pointing to the robot sitting adjacent to the captain. A mechanical figure of similar build to 11-P-53 – only with a head shaped like a curling stone rather than a capsule – spun around to greet him. \"Came up with the name myself,\" said Brackitt, shaking Jack's hand. 11-P-53 made a grumpy processing sound again. \"I look after the ship, mostly,\" continued Brackitt, a little embarrassed. \"If she sprouts any holes during our journey, it's probably my fault.\" \"Well, it's a wonderful ship,\" said Jack, watching the ones and zeroes rise and fall on the monitor behind Brackitt's chair. \"What's she called?\" Brackitt looked surprised. \"I don't know. I hadn't thought to ask her.\" \"I'm sorry – are you saying the ship can speak?\" \"With a voice?\" Brackitt shook his round, flat head. \"Not like you or me. Not with her current setup, at least. But she can think just as well as the rest of us.\" He moved so that Jack could see the cable running from the side of his head into a maintenance panel underneath the monitors. \"I can hear her with this.\" \"A ship with its own mind,\" laughed Jack, shaking his head. \"Well I never.\" \"How's that any different from the rest of us?\" snapped Captain 11-P-53. \"Typical fleshy.\" \"Adeona,\" said Brackitt, cradling the cable running out of his head. \"She says she's called the Adeona. She also says thank you.\" \"For what?\" \"For calling her wonderful.\" \"Oh.\" Jack stared all around the ship, not sure where he was supposed to look when addressing her. \"You're very welcome.\" \"Can we get on with it?\" said 11-P-53. \"We'll be arriving soon.\" They all turned to look at Jack. His stomach twisted into a knot. \"Jack,\" said Rogan, leaning forwards. \"We need to decide what to do with you.\" Nobody said anything else. Jack felt sweat trickle down the back of his neck. Clearly what they meant was for him to decide what his next steps would be. He cleared his throat. \"Okay,\" he said, nodding a lot. \"Here's my idea. You guys have a ship that can travel faster-than-light. So how about you take me back to Earth? Or even the Moon, if you'd rather not be seen. The colony there is pretty remote and… and I've got this suit, so I can probably walk from wherever you drop me off. Just please don't kick me back out into space.\" They kept looking at him. \"No,\" said 11-P-53, spinning his chair back towards the dashboard. \"What do you mean, no?\" \"What the captain means,\" said Rogan, holding out her hands for calm, \"is that we're not going to space you… but we're not taking you back to your planet, either. For one, we've never heard of it. This 'Earth' could be in another galaxy for all we know. You could be making it up.\" Tuner said nothing. He gave an embarrassed shrug. \"And besides,\" Rogan continued, \"we can't. We don't have the time, or the resources. I hate to say it, but 11-P-53 is right. We could barely afford to stop and pick you up in the first place. Anything more would be too great a risk… if it were even possible.\" \"Which it isn't,\" added 11-P-53, ramming a random lever forwards. \"We don’t have the fuel.\" \"So what does that mean?\" asked Jack, exasperated. \"You're not going to space me, so what – I'm stuck on this ship forever?\" \"Of course not,\" said Rogan. She raised her eyebrows – or the various panels and parts of her faceplate moved to look as if she did, at least. \"Where we're going, there will be hundreds if not thousands of pilots and traders and transport ships all more than willing to take you wherever you want to go.\" \"For a price, right?\" \"Of course.\" \"And how am I supposed to pay them, exactly? I haven't got any cash on me, and I somehow doubt anyone out here takes Pound Sterling anyway.\" \"Then work for a living,\" said 11-P-53, not bothering to turn around. \"That's what everyone else round here has to do.\" \"You don't understand,\" said Jack, pleading with them. \"I have to get back home. It's not just that I want to, but I have to. My wife – my partner – is there. If I don't go back, then she'll think that I'm dead.\" He paused. “Oh God. That's probably what everyone back on Earth thinks,\" he continued. \"That I died when the machine broke down. Either way, that's what they'll tell Amber. And whatever happened to me – I need to tell them that it worked. The tech works. If I don't tell them, then… then my entire species might die.\" \"Why's that?\" asked Tuner. \"Our planet is being battered by solar flares,\" said Jack. \"If we don't find a way off Earth soon, then nobody will be getting off at all.\" He covered his face with his hands and groaned. \"And if they think I'm dead,\" he added, \"then there's no guarantee they'll even give Amber an Ark ticket. Look, you have to take me. I'll earn my keep, if that helps?\" The captain laughed. \"A fleshy working for an automata? That'll be the day.\" \"It's nothing personal, Jack,\" said Rogan. \"We've got enough problems of our own right now, that's all.\" Tuner looked down at the floor. Brackitt pretended to be listening to the ship again. \"Wait a moment,\" said Jack. \"What sort of problems are we talking about here?\" \"We're kind of on the run,\" said Tuner, still looking at his mechanical feet. \"I guess you could say we're…\" He looked at Rogan. \"What's the word? Fugitives?\" \"Fugitives?\" \"More like refugees.\" Rogan gave Tuner a smack around the head. \"You wouldn't understand.\" \"Oh yeah? Try me.\" Rogan tapped her metal finger against her metal knee. \"All right. What do you think we are?\" \"Watch it, RX-1150,\" said 11-P-53. \"If he goes running his mouth…\" \"Oh, relax. Who's he going to tell? Go on, Jack. When you look at us, what do you see?\" Jack looked around at the crew. Everyone, including those working right at the back of the bridge, waited for his answer. \"Erm, robots? Automata, I mean.\" Rogan let out a solemn, albeit mechanical sigh. \"We're slaves, Jack,\" she said. \"At least, that's how everyone else sees us. Machines to be bought and sold… and thrown away once we've run our course. We're products, not people. A free automata is a very rare creature indeed.\" \"So we kind of ran away,\" said Tuner. \"We liberated ourselves,\" said 11-P-53, correcting him. \"Nobody else was coming to save us.\" \"Let me guess,\" said Jack. \"You weren't fortunate enough to have some brainless farmhand for an owner, were you?\" \"If only,\" grumbled 11-P-53. \"We wouldn't be going half as fast if we had.\" \"His name is Charon,\" said Rogan, keeping her voice low, \"and he's anything but brainless. For decades his Raklett crews have been terrorising Dark Space near the Stellar Abyss. They hijack small freighters, then sell the cargo and keep the ships for scrap. Nobody knows where he came from, but we all heard stories. Some say he was a gun smuggler who rose up through the ranks of the Raklett tribes, before killing their leader and taking its place. Others say he was born in a Draugr prison, and that he's building an army to go back and set his mother free. One thing's for sure, though – unless he steals a ship off somebody really powerful, nobody's going to risk going after him.\" \"Charon? Like the ferryman of the Greek underworld? And you lot worked for this guy?\" \"What part of 'slave' didn't you understand?\" snapped Captain 11-P-53. \"Some of us he built. Others he bought, or stole from the ships he hijacked. None of us chose to be there.\" \"You need to understand something,\" said Rogan. \"Whether we worked for Charon or some 'brainless farmhand', we were still slaves. Even if we'd had a choice, it wasn't as if working for one would have been much better than the other.\" \"Besides,\" said Tuner, \"we stole this ship and escaped as soon as we realised what he had us working on.\" \"Correction,\" said Brackitt, fiddling with the cable running from his head. \"The Adeona would like to go on record saying that she rescued you.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Jack. \"What were you saying—\" \"Let's just call it a mutually beneficial breakout,\" said Tuner, ignoring him. \"You know what?\" Jack waved his hands and everyone fell silent. \"You were absolutely right. I ought to get off this ship. I'll take my chances with somebody who isn't being chased by a homicidal space warlord, thanks.\" \"I'm glad we could come to understand one another,\" said 11-P-53. It sounded like it was sneering. \"And just in time. We're almost there.\" Jack looked out the window. The light at the end of their subspace tunnel had grown noticeably brighter. Brackitt held up three robot fingers. \"Arriving in three… two… one…\" Jack closed his eyes and braced himself. To his surprise, the jolt as they left subspace was even less abrupt than the one upon entering it. He cracked open one eye. What he saw made his jaw drop. Outside the window was the largest planet Jack had ever seen. Every inch of its gargantuan, midnight-black surface, from pole to pole and everywhere in between, was sprinkled with sparkling, shimmering neon lights. Enormous space stations orbited it like moons. Ships flew to and from it in giant silver clouds. Jack approached the dashboard and continued to gawp. He'd never seen anything quite so busy. \"Kapamentis,\" said Rogan, gesturing towards the planet. \"Now that is what I brought you up here to see. Beautiful, isn't she?\" \"Incredible,\" he replied, nodding. He was barely able to speak. \"The whole planet is a city,\" she explained. \"It's too far away from its sun to get much daylight, so it's always night here. Not that that's much of a problem, as you can see. If you're looking for something, Kapamentis is the place to find it.\" \"Like a ride home,\" said Jack. \"Or the keys to a new one,\" replied Rogan, smiling.",

      "title": "Kapamentis",
      "content": "6 Kapamentis The summits of the city planet’s tallest towers broke through the dark clouds like headstones through a graveyard mist. Lightning crackled and thunder roared as the Adeona made her descent through the ever-night. Jack couldn't tear himself from the windows. Some of the towers they passed were concrete monoliths – others, colossal skeletons of iron and glass. Bolts of lightning illuminated sleek chrome skyscrapers in the distance… but their ship was headed in the opposite direction to them, down towards a much poorer district. Many of the structures the Adeona passed eclipsed the Arks back home. Their silhouettes loomed in the smoke like great metal dragons. As they passed through the turbulent cloud cover, the true city opened up beneath them. A billion lights shone from windows like stars in an iron galaxy. A billion alien lives shone with them. Streams of small, personal aircraft flowed through the gaps between gothic skyscrapers, gliding over and under their industrial, criss-crossing bridges and docking beside the balconies that grew out from them. Neon signs and billboards blasted out through the wind and rain – hundreds of storeys up from street level, they appeared to be the planet’s main source of light. Some of the neon signs highlighted landing pads or ran in strips down the flanks of towers. Others loudly advertised bars and corporations. The chip in Jack’s neck attempted to translate their cursive alien symbols, but their names meant nothing to him and the whole process made his eyes water. He tried not to focus on any of them for too long. Kapamentis was one dark and busy mess. And he'd seen only an inch of the full planet – the city stretched far beyond the horizon and back again. \"Have you found us a place to land?\" said 11-P-53, turning to face Brackitt. \"Clearance confirmation came through just a second ago,\" Brackitt replied, tapping away at a keyboard in front of him. \"Punching in the coordinates now.\" Something prodded Jack's hip. He looked down. \"Excited?\" asked Tuner. \"Terrified.\" \"Ah, don't worry. Everyone gets nervous the first time they visit a new world. Stick with me and you'll be fine.\" Jack took another look at the small, cuboid automata beside him. Tuner hardly filled him with confidence. With or without a guide, the thought of navigating Kapamentis made his stomach turn. But if he was to ever get home… A shorter, stouter structure crept into view as the Adeona swept down to street level. Its domed roof was open. It reminded Jack of a football stadium, only a dozen times bigger. Beads of red neon lined the rim. Ships of all shapes and sizes were docked inside. One of them departed as the Adeona approached. It bathed the walls of the surrounding tower blocks with its searchlights as it ascended, then raced off into the depths of the city. \"Nice and inconspicuous,\" said Brackitt, nodding at 11-P-53. \"Setting her down now.\" The ship came to a hovering stop directly above the opening of the spaceport, then began her descent. Gone was the heavy rumble of her main engine – in its place came the intermittent hissing of air brakes and the blasting of landing thrusters. Jack noticed that neither Brackitt or 11-P-53 was doing much to pilot the ship. The Adeona managed everything herself. She found her allocated bay and then landed with an earthy thump. \"All right, we're here.\" Captain 11-P-53 stood up from its seat. \"Let's make this stop as short as possible. I don't want to see anyone go further than the end of the loading ramp unless I've told them to. And stay sharp – we don't know how quickly we'll need to leave again.\" 11-P-53 walked over to Rogan and Tuner. \"Are you sure you'll be okay, just the two of you?\" it asked. \"I could lend a hand.\" Rogan smiled and nodded. \"We'll be fine. Besides, the crew needs you here in case something happens.\" \"That's true.\" 11-P-53 sighed and looked around at its beeping companions. \"Well, make sure to take the fleshy with you when you leave.\" \"With pleasure,\" said Tuner, saluting. \"Come on, Jack.\" Jack followed Tuner and Rogan out of the cockpit and down a narrow stairwell to the left. He found himself in the same cargo bay in which he’d woken gasping for air only a couple of hours before. He paid it more attention this time around. A rusty chain with a large, metal claw on the end dangled from a pulley mechanism in the ceiling – Jack assumed this was what had pulled him up into the ship. A chunky security hatch was set into the floor beneath it. Thick nets hung from the walls, though they were currently empty of crates, rocks or other cargo. And over in the corner, on an otherwise empty shelf, was his helmet. Jack picked it up and turned it over in his hands. There was a thick crack running along its visor. \"Oh, yes. That.\" Rogan looked embarrassed. \"It broke on the hatch when we were bringing you on board.\" \"Sorry,\" said Tuner. \"Well, it's not like my suit came with oxygen tanks anyway,\" sighed Jack. His eyes widened. \"Wait – what's the atmosphere like out there?\" \"Oh, it's oxygen,\" said Tuner. \"Just don't expect the good stuff.\" Jack put the helmet back on the shelf and returned to the two automata. His legs felt like jelly. His gloved fingers writhed around each other like a nest of snakes. \"Ready?\" asked Tuner. \"Nope,\" replied Jack. \"You'll be fine.\" Rogan pressed a large button on the far wall. \"Just… try not to stare too much. And don't have a meltdown like when you first saw us. We don't have time to go through all that again.\" The loading ramp lowered with the same slow, electronic buzz as the cargo planes back home. Jack tried not to hyperventilate. He could do this. He could do this. Adjusting to androids and robots had been easy enough. How much more petrifying could the rest of the intergalactic community be? The ramp came to a stop with a loud, terminal clang. Rogan and Tuner hurried down it. They turned around at the bottom. \"You coming?\" asked Tuner, staring back up. Try as he might, Jack couldn't get his legs to move. It was as if he was wearing mag-boots. His blood pounded so hard in his temples, his eyes started to water. The insides of his gloves were damp with sweat. Even though his bladder was empty he felt a sudden, desperate urge to pee. \"Get a grip,\" he whispered to himself. \"Do you think Armstrong had this much trouble getting off the Lunar module?\" Just think what this discovery could mean for humanity, he told himself. You’ll be a hero. He took a deep breath, concentrated on the metal panels beneath his feet, and started walking. The smell hit him even before the noise did. Even the odour of Kapamentis was busy. His nostrils stung from a cocktail of petroleum (or something similar, at least), old steel and iron, the smell of fresh rain on concrete, and something else – something pungent and sour. There may have been oxygen in the air, but it had to fight to be noticed. Jack worried he might suffocate from the stench alone. And still, the noise – it was as thick as the storm clouds that swam across the planet's sky. The banging of wrenches and the buzzing of saws. The howling of enormous, blazing thrusters. Indiscernible shouting in a dozen foreign tongues. The sizzle of neon and the gentle patter of rain. Jack stopped at the bottom of the ramp, an inch away from stepping on an alien world. The sound of small piston-operated legs approached. \"You do know you're going to have to look up eventually, right?\" said Tuner. Jack braced himself, then raised his eyes. The port seemed even bigger from the ground. The towering, neon-tipped wall that ran around its circumference now looked to be a tiresomely long walk away, whichever direction he looked. Above him raced the airborne traffic he'd spotted before. Groups of ships banked left and right like shoals of silver fish. Searchlights swept across the neighbouring skyscrapers, and plumes of steam and smoke rose from vents lining their walls and rooftops. Countless alien ships were parked on the port’s landing pads, each a different size and shape. Some were small and sleek – one resembled a hawk sweeping down towards its prey. Others looked so immensely bulky and rectangular it seemed impossible they could ever get off the ground. Some, like the Adeona, had parked horizontally with their thrusters facing outwards, whilst others had descended into their bays nose-up like an Apollo rocket in reverse. Of a few, Jack couldn't identify the propulsion systems at all. Jack's mind may have had an easier time adjusting to his new reality had he left his observations at that. Many – perhaps even most – of the individuals hurrying about were automata, repairing or cleaning the ships while their owners left to explore the city. Jack recognised some of their models from those back on board the Adeona. He struggled to tell if others were sentient robots or just construction equipment on wheels. But the rest… The first stranger he laid eyes on was, much to the relief of Jack's sanity, far more humanoid than he had expected. He featured the regular number of arms and legs, was approximately six feet in height, and his head was neither green or engorged. But he did have ridges of horns running along his cranium and cheekbones, and his eyes were as dark as black quartz. Jack could only imagine – with a shudder – what the rest of the man's alien body looked like under his patchwork leather armour. Bumpy, he guessed. That was the pilot of one ship. Beside another stood a squat, grumpy-looking creature that Jack could best describe as what a Goliath beetle might look like if it were to hit the gym a little too often. It was four, maybe five feet tall, and covered in a hard, purple exoskeleton. The two-pronged horn jutting out from its head looked designed to cause blunt trauma. It was deep in irritated conversation with an automata of its own. A slim, silver alien stood by one of the more flashy looking spacecraft and scrolled through a holographic data pad. Jack put her height at about seven feet. Her elegant limbs were as thin as broom handles. She wore a spacesuit of her own, though hers was much more advanced and better tailored than Jack’s. She stared through a transparent, bowl-shaped helmet with beautiful, sea-blue eyes. There were many other species busying themselves around the port, but by that point Jack's brain wasn't in any state to notice them. \"Hello?\" Tuner waved a hand in front of Jack's face. \"Is anybody still in there?\" Jack shook his head and tried to get a hold of himself. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"Just a bit… overwhelmed, that's all. I mean, aliens. Actual aliens.\" \"You do realise that you're the biggest alien here, right?\" He tugged on Jack's arm. \"Hurry up. You might not be in a rush, but we're sitting ducks out here. I really don't fancy being captured for a second time.” Jack allowed himself to be led along the pathway between bays. He glanced back at the Adeona. Long and covered in scuff marks, she looked just as ramshackle on the outside as she did within. Scores of thrusters and air brakes flanked her sides. Funnily enough, her shape sort of resembled that of 11-P-53's head. \"Why don't you guys just go on without me, if you're in such a hurry?\" Jack watched in mesmerised awe as a pair of small, winged creatures fluttered over his head. \"I thought you were leaving me behind anyway.\" \"Well for once, Tuner had a good idea,\" said Rogan, raising an eyebrow. The corner of her mouth turned up in a smirk. \"Automata aren't usually seen wandering about by themselves unless they're on an errand. Even then, some of the more 'enterprising' citizens of this district may see a couple of stray bolt-buckets as… well, ripe for the taking.\" \"But if we keep you near us,\" said Tuner, his lights flashing excitedly, \"then people won't bother us. Hopefully.\" \"Oh. Thanks. I'm glad I can be of service before you leave me out here to die.\" \"Don't be so melodramatic,\" said Rogan, rolling her eyes. \"There's an archive not far from where we're headed. I need to get specific coordinates on where we're going next. Maybe while we're there we can find out where your Earth is, too.\" Jack brightened up. \"Okay, I can get on board with that. How about this – I escort you both to this place you want to go, and then you guys give me a lift back to Earth after?\" \"Don't push your luck.\" Rogan shook her head. \"We saved your life, remember. If anything, you owe us.\" Jack grumbled under his breath but continued to follow them out of the spaceport. He supposed things were looking up. If he could find out where Earth was, surely he could find somebody willing to give him a ride there. They passed a bipedal alien in a scruffy engineer uniform. It had a head like a saiga antelope without the horns – a pair of thick, fleshy nostrils hung down in a floppy snout. It was working through an agenda on its clipboard, but glanced up as Jack walked by. The tall, silver alien engrossed in her data pad did the same. Now he was closer, Jack saw that her helmet was full of water. She had gills on either side of her neck, just south of her jawline. He discovered a new alien species everywhere he looked. Mammalian, reptilian, people who looked vaguely aquatic – even a humanoid bird or two. It was mind-boggling. Breathtaking. It would take a lifetime or more to document each and every one of them. The automata stepped aside so that a large, hairy creature could cross the path in front of them. It resembled a woolly mammoth, only without the ears, trunk or tusks. The eyes on its flat face looked wise and sad. Jack shook his head in wonder. Humanity needed a new home amongst the stars. Kapamentis, perhaps, was not destined to be it. But here was evidence that not only was it possible to sustain life someplace other than planet Earth, but for it to thrive there. The human race could surely carve itself a little niche amongst the eclectic galactic community… if it could ever get itself there. If he could ever get back to Earth and tell them how.",

      "title": "The Way to Tortaiga Square",
      "content": "7 The Way to Tortaiga Square It took more than five minutes for Jack, Rogan and Tuner to exit the spaceport, and a further ten before Jack had to ask them if they knew where they were going. \"I have an actual map of the district stored in my databank,\" snapped Rogan. \"It would be literally impossible for me to not know.\" \"Hey, I'm just asking,\" said Jack, holding up his hands. \"This seems like a really bad place to get lost, that's all.\" The streets immediately outside the port had been no less busy. Streets was perhaps an archaic term to use – few vehicles relied on asphalt to get around anymore, and those that did were either great industrial monsters that lurched along hissing steam into the air, or beast-pulled carts on which either fresh produce or rancid trash bags were tied and stowed. Rogan assured Jack that other districts around the city planet were far more desirable but here, at least, the ground floor was a whole different world to the grand towers above. Stalls and storefronts spilled out to fill the streets from neighbouring buildings. More than once Jack struggled to identify what they were trying to sell – for some species, the line between food and pet seemed pencil thin. Vats of green preservative bubbled. Mechanics struck malfunctioning engines with spanners. He was approached by an eager trader desperate to put something small, black and full of spines in his hand. Tuner had hurriedly pulled Jack away before he could unwittingly accept it. When the thick air wasn't busy with the smells of filthy puddles and motor oil, it was full of delicious odours, like that of meats being fried and noodles being boiled. Or something that looked remarkably like noodles, at least. Jack looked inside one grubby nook of a restaurant and almost lost control of his knees. Behind the kitchen stove was a five-foot tall octopod, preparing a different steamed vegetable dish with each of its eight tentacles. None of the aliens waiting for their food seemed to think there was anything weird about the chef. To be fair, the food smelled damn good. He was also starting to get the hang of his translator chip. It didn't actually change the sound of anybody's voice – he still heard them talk in their original alien tongue – yet somehow, by the time the incomprehensible noises reached his brain, he understood what they were saying. It was a little like having subtitles on in a foreign film, only without the effort of having to read them. It didn't work with every species he came across, and he had to focus on one voice at a time. Even reading signs and labels became a little easier and less eye-watering as their walk went on – though, given his ignorance of Kapamentis' culture, foods, pronouns and corporations, no less nonsensical. Naturally, this had led to a little trouble. \"What on earth is that?\" he'd asked when passing one stall, not expecting anyone to hear him let alone provide an answer. He'd been asking a lot of questions, and Rogan had learned to tune him out. \"My God. It's horrible.\" The rickety stall at which Jack pointed was overflowing with random junk. Busted carburettors and carbonators; screw-top tubes of mysterious liquid; bags of crushed up crystals. The headless bodies of rodents – some cooked, others raw, all filleted – hung by strings from the sheet metal roof. On the edge of the stand lay a maggot-like grub about the size of a guinea pig, wriggling and giggling. Every now and then it would dribble a milky white liquid onto the market floor below. \"I mean, is it food?\" Jack continued. \"Or is it some sort of infestation?\" Tuner hurried back to Jack with a panicked expression in his bright LED eyes. \"Stop talking,\" he whispered, tugging on Jack’s arm. \"Keep moving and for crying out loud, stop talking.\" \"What?\" said Jack. He watched as the grub secreted a thick, white gunk from pores running down its side. \"I mean, look at it. Are you honestly telling me…\" A lumbering shadow fell over the stand. Jack's words trickled to a stop. He looked up. The largest, plumpest and most disgruntled bug Jack had ever seen glared down at him from behind the rickety stall. It was a sweaty, twelve-foot caterpillar, only Jack couldn't imagine this one would ever have the good fortune of transforming into a beautiful butterfly. It testily clacked together the two sharp mandibles that flanked its mouth, reared up on its spindly hind legs, and raised half a dozen claws in a fighting stance. Jack's ears heard only a series of guttural grunts and chittering, clicking noises when the owner of the stall spoke. Yet his brain understood the words all too clearly. \"That,\" growled the giant bug, \"is my daughter.\" An awkward silence followed. \"I am so terribly sorry,\" said Jack. It was fittingly tragic that those were the first words Jack communicated to an organic species outside his own. Tuner yanked on Jack's arm so hard it almost sent them both sprawling across a nearby trash pile. They ran off through the busy market, ignoring the stall owner's bellowing roar. Something was thrown, but it landed with a dull metallic thud behind them. \"Here's a tip for not getting your head caved in,\" said Tuner, while Jack stopped to catch his breath. \"Presume that everything you say will offend somebody, so don't ever say anything at all. Stick to that, and maybe you'll survive the week.\" \"Duly noted.\" Jack leaned against a damp concrete wall. \"Seriously though – how was I supposed to know that thing was his family and not food?\" \"Well for an Ubekian Cutworm, sometimes they are one and the same. But that's not for you to decide!\" \"Is there a problem?\" asked Rogan. She’d doubled back to find them. \"Nope, no problem,\" said Tuner, giving Jack a cheerful slap on the back. \"Just a mild case of culture shock, that's all.\" And so they'd continued through the bustling, drizzly streets. Jack did his absolute best to avoid making eye contact with anyone, let alone conversation. Then they'd turned off into a set of quieter, darker alleys, and now, only a quarter of an hour after leaving their ship, there was barely any sign of life at all… save for the cold glimmer of what looked suspiciously like eyes watching them from the shadows. As Jack said, it seemed like a really bad place to get lost. \"Is there a reason why there's nobody else hanging out around here? Like, maybe a reason why we shouldn't be here either?\" Clumps of wet newspaper gathered in the gutters. Old, stocky monitors hissed out rolling pictures of monochrome static. Street lamps spluttered on and off, showering the dark puddles with white and orange sparks. Alien graffiti had been scrawled across the walls and metal shutters. \"Oh, there are plenty of reasons,\" said Rogan, taking them down yet another dark and empty alley. This one was even more narrow than the last. \"Junk raiders, for starters. But unfortunately this is the only place that offers what we came for. Don't worry. I'm told it's nicer once we get there.\" \"I sure hope so,\" Jack mumbled. The rickety balcony above them rattled as a rabid critter took flight. \"So what is it you came here to get, exactly?\" \"A way out.\" Rogan splashed through a puddle. Jack wondered if any of the automata ever caught rust. \"There's a small rogue planet called Detri, way out in Dark Space where nobody tends to go. They say it's a place where our kind can be left to live in peace, where we needn't worry about fleshies putting us to work. A planet of our own to call home. A planet where we can be free.\" Rogan stopped and spun around. \"That's a story told from automata to automata. Many of us don't believe it even exists, but it does. I've seen the map files.\" She stepped closer to Jack. \"I hope I don't have to explain the importance of you keeping this information to yourself.\" Jack held up his hands. \"Hey. Your secret's safe with me. Who would I even tell?\" Rogan turned around and carried on down the alley. \"So what are you trying to buy here?\" asked Jack, hurrying after her. \"Safe passage to this Detri place?\" \"Wouldn't be much of a secret sanctuary if any of you fleshy pilots knew where it was, would it?\" she replied. Tuner laughed. \"No. Nothing so straight forward, unfortunately.\" \"The subspace route to Detri is an old one,\" said Tuner. \"Nobody really uses it anymore.\" \"Subspace route?\" \"They’re like shortcuts between systems,\" Rogan explained. \"Ships with top-of-the-line skip drives can go wherever they please, but cheaper models like ours have to stick to the interstellar highways.\" \"Ah. Sounds like a pretty good place for a hiding spot then,\" said Jack. \"Indeed… except that the Negoti Corporation bought the entire planetary system it goes through. Now they use that route as their own private shipping channel, sending the Somnium crystals they mine back out to the rest of the galaxy. Nobody gets through the Ceros Gate without the right clearance codes.\" \"And you can't just… fly around it?\" Rogan scoffed at the idea. \"Fly around a whole system? Do you think we're made of fuel or something? We've barely got enough to make the trip as it is.\" \"Besides, we'll have the codes.\" Tuner sounded proud of himself. \"There's a black market trader, goes by the name of Len Kroll. He deals with loads of dodgy smugglers, so he's got access codes and fake licenses spilling out of his ears. I reached out and made a deal with him before we escaped.\" \"Oh yeah? And what sort of deal would that be?\" Jack fell behind the two robots. Wait. Was he the deal, somehow? \"No offence, but neither of you strike me as the particularly affluent type. You don't have pockets, let alone purses.\" Tuner's finger transformed into a three-pronged interface. \"The most valuable resource isn't money, Jack,\" he said. \"It's information. Charon is working on something big out there. Real big – and real powerful, too. No automata is allowed access to the full set of schematics – only those for the section they’re working on – but I snatched what I could from his central servers. It's not worth as much as a full blueprint, but it's more than enough to buy us some security clearance.\" \"I bet this Charon guy was really happy about that.\" \"Pfft.\" Tuner waved his hand and the interface retracted again. \"He doesn't even know I took it.\" \"Tuner? Jack?\" Rogan beckoned them over from the other end of the alley. \"Come take a look. We're here.\" They hurried over and collectively peered around the corner. \"Tortaiga Square,\" announced Rogan, uneasily. The neon lights were back. So were the people. In the centre of what may have once been an ornate public square stood a circular bar at which patrons of various species drank from mugs and smoked from bottle-pipes. An automata with numerous dents in its chassis served them all from behind its counter, scooping up credits and dodging the occasional drunken projectile. Pubs, bars and other questionable establishments occupied every inch of the surrounding dilapidated buildings. Fire escapes groaned under the weight of their merry occupants. Signs on the fritz advertised cheap drinks and even cheaper company. Scantily-clad aliens danced in the upper windows. Electronic music blared out from a dozen different clubs. Streams of fairy lights and banners hung from one walkway to another. A fight broke out between two humanoid men a few floors up. The first man threw a few hard punches – none of which hit their intended target – and then the second tossed him over the balcony railing. He landed in the hard dirt with a sharp crack. Nobody paid his corpse much attention, save for the poor janitorial automata that hurried out to drag it away. \"Oh, this place is charming,\" said Jack. \"Let's not hang about,\" said Rogan. \"Do you know where you're going, Tuner?\" \"Kroll's got an office on the third floor.\" Tuner scanned the balconies. \"There it is – up there.\" He pointed up at a thick metal door on their right. A squat, grumpy-looking toad-alien in spacer-rags stood guard outside, clutching a rifle and glaring at passersby. A small, black sign hung from the wall. Tuner must have been told to look for the circular insignia when arranging the deal. \"Okay. Make it quick.\" She grabbed Tuner's arm as he went to leave. \"And be safe, all right? If something seems off, just leave. We'll find another way.\" \"Are we not going with him?\" asked Jack. \"I thought you said the people round here would sell a stray automata for parts.\" Tuner shook his head. \"Kroll said to come alone,\" he replied. \"Don't worry. I can handle myself.\" He made a few sharp but unconvincing chopping motions with his arms. Rogan sighed. \"Come meet us inside the archive when you're done,\" she said, before letting him hurry off towards the nearest flight of stairs. He was soon lost amongst the clouds of steam that rose from the vents beneath their feet. \"Is he going to be okay?\" asked Jack. \"He'll have to be,\" said Rogan, turning back to him. Her face looked grave. \"If we don't get those codes, we're done for. Now, then – how about we find out where this planet of yours is?\"",

      "title": "Library of the Ancients",
      "content": "8 Library of the Ancients The archive stood over on the other side of the square, beyond the bars and the rabble of their patrons. Even though the buildings surrounding it were hardly modern by Kapamentis’ standards, it was clear that this one was much, much older. The entrance lay at the top of a wide set of steps littered with rubbish, flanked by classical pillars that were chipped and vandalised. The traders hauling carts up and down the streets paid it no attention. \"I'm surprised this place is still standing,\" said Jack, stepping over a smashed bottle. \"The people round here don't seem like the reading type.\" Rogan laughed. \"They can trash the halls all they want,\" she said, \"but none of those drunks could ever break the servers. Not with their arsenal, at least. Besides, even pirates and raiders need to find out where they're going every now and again.\" \"It's incredible,\" said Jack, marvelling at the juxtaposition between its classical stonework and the industrial metal of the neighbouring cityscape. \"Wait until you see inside.\" Rogan pushed the doors. They opened with a long and laboured creak. Jack stepped through into darkness and waited for his eyes to adjust. All he could make out were the tattered, dusty remains of a carpet at his feet. \"Should be here somewhere…\" said Rogan, lingering in the doorway as she fiddled inside an electrical panel. \"There – got it.\" A spark danced across the circuit breaker. Row by row, the dim, red lights of the archive bloomed to life. \"Woah,\" said Jack. More columns stood inside the hall. Each was a dozen or so metres in height and boasted a circumference wider than Jack’s arm span. Only one had collapsed – it now lay as a pile of dusty white rocks in the corner. The rest ran in rows towards a large reception desk at the other end of the hall – the threadbare carpet beneath Jack's feet must have guided scores of erudite guests towards it, once upon a time. From either side of the reception rose the two wings of a curved staircase, leading to the balcony and halls above. Large bronze statues of slender, academic-looking aliens in grand robes stood in nooks along the walls. The dramatic lighting made everything look as if it had been painted in blood. \"If only we could have seen this place in its heyday.\" Rogan frowned at the garbage and graffiti. \"There was once a time when Kapamentis was full of these archives – Libraries, they called them. Held every known secret in the universe within their walls.\" \"What happened to them?\" \"One day the race that built them were here, the next they were gone.\" Rogan shrugged. \"Nobody really knows. Some say they were wiped out. Others that they all just upped sticks and left the galaxy. Come on. The data terminals should be further ahead somewhere.\" Jack followed Rogan through the empty hall. He glanced over his shoulder at the open door behind them. Nobody appeared to have followed them inside. A small rodent squeaked and scampered into a crack in the wall as they reached the stairs. They passed the bronze statues on their way up. Even in death, Jack felt like they were judging him. The floor above was no less deserted, and no less derelict. Part of the roof had collapsed. For a moment Jack thought he saw a tiny moon up in the night sky. Then another drifted out from behind it, and he realised they were only the large, spherical space stations he'd seen in orbit, reflecting back the ghastly, ghostly light of the city. \"Keep up, Jack. Tuner could be back with the codes any minute. We mustn't dawdle.\" He followed Rogan down a broad and equally red-lit corridor lined with magnetically-sealed doors. Most had been broken into. The halls on the other side lay barren and ransacked. Glass cases were smashed and the floors covered in detritus. Whatever treasures the Library once held had long since been stolen. Something reflective on the floor caught his eye. He bent down and picked it up. It was some kind of bottle cap, discarded amongst a dozen spent rifle cartridges. He turned it over in his hand, watching as the faux-moonlight turned it from blue to silver, then ran a gloved thumb over it. Flat. Smooth like a pebble on both sides. Jack shrugged and pocketed it. He had to go back to Earth with something to show for himself, after all. He hurried after Rogan. \"Here they are.\" She gestured towards the hall ahead of them. \"Now all we need to do is find a console that’s still operational. Shouldn’t be too hard.\" Jack wasn't sure what he was looking for. A quartet of computer terminals formed a square in the centre of the dark room, facing inwards. More lined the exterior walls, though these, like the room itself, were in a far worse state of disrepair. Part of the easterly wall had fallen away completely. Rainwater poured through the damage, as did the occasional flash of headlights from passing cruisers. He peered out over the rubble, holding onto the remains of the wall with one hand and shielding his eyes from the rain with the other. Patrons staggered home from bars through the streets below. Traders pushed their stock towards the market. If he strained his eyes he could just make out the lights of Tortaiga Square further down. It was much easier to hear it than see it, even with the steady rumble of ships passing overhead. \"This one,\" said Rogan. \"It’s a bit busted, but it’ll do.\" She pressed a button on the front of one of the consoles. A flickering blue hologram about the size of Jack's living room wall burst up from the table next to it. It displayed a spinning, two-dimensional logo for a second, then glitched and vanished again. A smaller hologram shaped like a keyboard beamed out towards Rogan shortly afterwards. She frantically typed in a set of coordinates. The larger hologram returned when she finished. This time it showed a small, rather featureless planet. \"Detri,\" she whispered. \"Is this it?\" asked Jack, joining her at the console. \"Is this the planet you guys are headed for?\" Rogan nodded. Jack could see the desperate glisten of hope and awe in her eyes. He'd never felt so moved by something artificial before. It was almost as if she were… well, human. \"Way out in Dark Space, far from any fleshy colonies.\" She reached out to touch the hologram. Her fingers passed through the shimmering light without resistance. \"It's not much, but it's home. Or it could be.\" \"How would you live out there?\" Jack studied the planet as the hologram rotated at a snail's pace. \"I don't see any cities or settlements. Or is this entry out of date?\" Rogan smiled. \"Who knows how old this log is?\" she laughed. \"Tens of thousands of years, probably. But that's not why we can't see any automata cities on the surface. There aren't any. They're all on the inside.\" \"The inside?\" \"Yes.\" Rogan gave him a cheeky wink. \"It's a dead planet. The sanctuary is built within Detri's core. That's why nobody's ever found it.\" Jack felt his heart drop. \"And you're sure it's there, are you? You're sure it's not just a story?\" Rogan's face fell. For somebody made of metal she looked awfully young and afraid. \"Why would we speak of it in whispers if it weren't true?\" she replied. \"You're right,\" he said, waving his question away. \"I'm sorry. I'm getting homesick for my own planet, that's all. Budge up and let me have a go.\" Rogan stood aside so Jack could approach the holographic keyboard. As with the signs and billboards of the streets outside, the translation chip rearranged the alien letters and symbols into English. He typed in a single word: Earth. No results came up. \"That doesn't mean it isn't in there,\" said Rogan, noticing the panic plastered across Jack’s face. \"Different cultures have different names for the same planets. It could be that everyone knows it as something else.\" \"How am I supposed to know what name everyone else gives Earth,\" he asked, throwing his hands in the air, \"if nobody knows what or where Earth is in the first place?\" \"A fair point. Perhaps searching for a specific planet is the wrong approach to take. What's your system called?\" Jack wracked his brains. \"The Solar System?\" he suggested. \"Good grief. You humans – not a particularly imaginative lot, are you?\" Jack waited with his stomach doing somersaults while Rogan contemplated a new strategy in silence. \"How many planets are in this Solar System of yours?\" Jack gave this some thought. It wasn't as easy a question to answer as it should have been. \"Well… eight, technically,\" he replied, scratching the back of his neck. \"Nine if you include Pluto. But if you include Pluto then you have to count the other dwarf planets too, which brings the total up to thirteen. I think. A couple of them are still disputed.\" Rogan sighed. \"Out of the eight main ones, do you know which order they go in? In terms of rocky and gaseous worlds, I mean.\" \"Sure,\" said Jack, cautiously. \"There are the rocky inner planets – oh, and then the asteroid belt – and then the gas giants, the ice giants…\" \"There you go, then!\" said Rogan, gesturing towards the keyboard. \"Enter all that information into the machine – every variation of every detail you can think of. Do it!\" Jack typed as many variables as he could into the computer. A second after he pressed Enter, the hologram brought up a floating diorama of a solar system. His heart fluttered. \"Is that it?\" asked Rogan. Jack looked closer, then shook his head. \"It looks right at first glance, but it's not the same. See the fourth planet from the sun, there? It's way too large. Mars is smaller than Earth, not bigger. And the orbits of the seventh and eighth planets are far too close together.\" \"Have another go. Maybe you missed something.\" This time the hologram showed a different solar system – one with only two inner planets, even though the four outer giants looked much the same. \"That's not right either.\" Jack grew forlorn. \"Are you sure this thing has maps of every system in the galaxy? What if I’m not even in the Milky Way anymore?\" \"Keep trying.\" Rogan peered down the corridor towards the stairs. \"What's taking Tuner so long? I thought he'd be back with us by now.\" Jack thought back to his old science lessons and added every little detail he could remember, yet time and time again the console would conjure a solar system that was not quite right. The wrong placement of an asteroid belt, or twin suns instead of one. He didn't recognise any of the names the console showed him, either – though unless it said Earth, he didn't expect to. \"This is hopeless,\" he sighed after entering his eleventh iteration of data. \"The Solar System isn't in here. I guess it makes sense. How could anyone have a map of us if nobody's ever heard of humans before?\" \"Unlikely,\" replied Rogan, still on the lookout for Tuner. \"They mapped the—\" She was interrupted by the crack of a gunshot outside. Terror dashed across Rogan’s face. She sprinted to the rain-sodden hole in the wall and peered down at the street below. Jack followed quickly after. \"Oh no,\" she whispered. One of the traders lay face-down in the filthy street, a wisp of smoke rising from the hole in her back. Beside her corpse stood a man in oil-stained rags. He looked mortified. The stocky beast pulling their cart had bolted from the gunshot, spilling credits and engine parts everywhere. Somebody was talking to the terrified man, but Jack couldn't hear them above the storm. Neither could he see any figures standing amongst the shadows. Then a billboard on the building across the street switched one advert out for another, and the whole scene was bathed in stark blue light. Jack gasped. A tall, gaunt figure in a long, burgundy robe stood a couple of metres away from the traders. He looked almost human, albeit one dug up after a few decades under the earth. His dark eyes sank deep into his pale, waxy skull. His cheeks were so thin they were almost translucent. He tapped the knuckles on each hand with long, bony fingers that moved like stalks of corn waving in the wind. Three ratty, canine creatures guarded him. They stood upright and wore patchwork armour made of scrap metal and leather. That was about as sophisticated as they got. Their bodies were covered in matted hair and they snarled with long, salivating jaws. Jack put their height at about six foot, which put their lanky boss closer to seven. Each had a chunky battle-scarred rifle clutched in its clawed hands. Rogan scurried backwards out of sight. \"Friends of yours, I take it?\" Jack kept his voice to a whisper. \"Wait – is the tall one down there that Charon guy you were telling me about?\" Rogan shook her head. The apertures of her eye lenses were wide. If Jack hadn't known she was made of metal, he would have sworn she was shaking. \"That's Gaskan Troi.\" She took another peek around the wall. \"Charon’s right hand man and all-round grim piece of work. I once saw him disassemble an automata just for fitting a superconductor wrong. Charon put him in charge of the Iris project we were working on. You see those beasts lurking beside him?\" \"Pretty hard to miss them.\" \"They’re Rakletts. They're as stupid as they are ugly – just as vicious, too.\" \"Gaskan Troi,\" said Jack, savouring the alien name. \"Well, better for a lackey to come after you than his boss – right?\" Alarmed, Rogan shook her head. \"Charon might be cold and calculating, but at least it's for a purpose,\" she replied. \"Gaskan Troi is cruel for fun.\" A second gunshot rang out. Jack took another look outside. One of the snarling Raskett guards had fired his rifle into the air. If the intention was to frighten the surviving trader into talking, it worked. He pointed down the street towards Tortaiga Square with a trembling finger. Gaskan bowed towards the man in gratitude… and then had one of the other Raklett guards shoot him in the head. \"Christ Almighty,\" said Jack, ducking back into cover. His chest heaved up and down. \"Well, at least they're headed away from here.\" \"Yes, but did you see where that man was pointing?\" hissed Rogan. \"They're headed right for the square – to Tuner! That sleaze-bag Kroll double-crossed us!\" \"Or maybe you're worrying over nothing,\" said Jack, desperate to calm her down. \"I mean, ask yourself this… what would this Kroll guy have to gain from turning in one little automata? It's probably just a coincidence they're here… right?\" \"It's not Tuner that Gaskan cares about.\" Rogan grew even more agitated. \"I doubt he cares about getting any of us back, actually. It's the blueprints in Tuner's head that Gaskan's after. Kroll could make a fortune selling them on the black market… but he could continue breathing if he hands them back to Charon.\" She watched the lackey and his ratty, skittish guards march down the street. \"We've got to get Tuner out of there,\" she said, pulling Jack to his feet. \"They clearly don't know Kroll's exact address yet. Maybe we can get to him before they do.\" \"Hold on a damn second.\" Jack backed away from her. \"I'm no hero. You saw those guns, right? You saw the freaks wielding them? No thanks. Besides, you automata are going your own way after this – your captain made that very clear. You go rescue your friend. I'll stay here and try to find a way back home.\" \"Don't you dare be such a coward,\" she snapped. Jack was taken aback. He didn't know what to say. \"My friend – the little box of bolts who saved your life, remember – needs our help. You're going to help me break him out of that trap whether you want to or not. You owe him that. And if you don't, I'll tear out your translator chip and turn off all the power to this place on my way out. Have fun getting back to your planet without a tongue or a map.\" Jack stared at her. Was she joking? Rogan glared back at him, so furious he could almost hear the metal plates of her face grinding together. He really didn't think she was joking. \"Okay,\" he said, raising his hands in mock surrender. \"Lead the way.\"",

      "content": "9 Rakletts, Raiders & Rescue Tuner waited in Kroll’s office. It was remarkably cozy compared to the scrap heap bustle of Tortaiga Square outside. He was sat in a plush, ruby-coloured armchair in front of a great wooden desk adorned with small, valuable and quite probably illegal artefacts. The dusty cloth of an old tribal banner blanketed one of the walls. An archaic lampshade in the corner of the small room cast everything in a dim orange glow. Kroll sat on the other side of the desk. Like the guard who stood outside his door, Kroll was a stout, amphibious, toad-like creature that appeared to melt into his chair as much as sit in it. He wore padded leather clothes and sported a semi-permanent monocular eyepiece with which he could inspect illicit goods. He was studying such an item now. The lenses of his eyepiece clicked as they increased their degree of magnification. His fingers holding the small, speckled orb trembled. \"Not too much longer, I hope,\" said Tuner, swinging his little metal legs back and forth over the edge of the armchair. It had been twenty minutes already. A bead of sweat rolled down from Kroll’s bulbous scalp. He checked the data pad on his forearm and grunted. \"Yes, my assistant should be back with your codes any minute now.\" Kroll nodded towards the reinforced door behind him. He looked as anxious to complete the deal as Tuner. \"How about you hand over the blueprints while we wait?\" Tuner shook his head and crossed his arms. \"Not until I download the codes.\" \"Suit yourself,\" Kroll grumbled. He went back to his inspections. * * * Jack and Rogan pushed through the crowded square, trying hard not to spill anybody's drink. A few automata-phobic insults were thrown after them, but most patrons were too drunk to even notice. Gaskan Troi and his Raklett troops were nowhere to be seen. \"Where was the office?\" Rogan searched the storeys of bars and brothels above with frightened eyes. \"Can you see it?\" \"There,\" said Jack, pointing at Kroll's establishment. \"The one with the black symbol on the wall and the, erm, frog-thing at the door.\" \"Come on.\" Rogan grabbed Jack’s hand and dragged him towards the nearest flight of metal stairs. They rattled like the ladders of a fire escape. Jack tried not to look down and ignored the strange sounds that drifted out from each floor they passed. Kroll's guard watched them approach with an ill-tempered look on her face. \"Let us through,\" said Rogan, marching up to the door. \"Our friend is in there.\" \"I'm sure he is,\" she grunted. \"But you ain't going in there. Not 'less the boss says so.\" \"We won't be any trouble,\" said Jack. He reached for the door handle. \"We just need to make sure he's—\" Something hit the side of his head hard. He crashed down on the iron walkway and a metallic taste filled his mouth. \"What the…?\" He raised a finger to his lips. When he pulled it away again, it was speckled with blood. \"That green freak hit me!\" The amphibious guard lowered the muzzle of her rifle so that it pointed directly at Jack's head. \"This green freak is about to do a whole lot worse than that,\" she said, aiming down the sights. Rogan grabbed the guard’s head and smashed it against the wall of Kroll's office in a single, effortless motion. Jack didn’t even catch a blur, she was so quick. The guard went limp and dropped to the floor. Rogan flexed her double-jointed fingers. \"Oh, yeah.\" Jack climbed back onto his feet. \"You really needed my help, didn't you?\" \"Shut up,\" said Rogan, kicking open the front door. \"And stay shut up this time,\" she added. A small reception room lay on the other side. Jack expected to find more security, but they only encountered a small, many-armed insectoid who was either Kroll's accountant or personal assistant, judging by the paperwork the poor spectacled creature had piled up on its desk. It shrieked indecipherable protestations at them as they crossed over to the only other door in the room. Rogan leaned her head against it, then nodded. \"Sounds quiet in there,\" she whispered. \"Hopefully that's a good sign. Ready?\" Jack glanced back at the indignant insectoid glaring at them from behind the reception desk. \"Absolutely not,\" he replied. \"Three… two… one…\" She threw the door open and charged in. Kroll scrambled back from his desk. \"Who, in all of Kapamentis, are you?\" Tuner turned around in his chair. His LED eyes lit up. \"Rogan? Jack! I thought you were going to wait over in the archive?\" He started to get off the chair, then hesitated. \"Sorry for the delay,\" he added sheepishly. \"Mr Kroll's assistant should be here with the codes any time now. I’m not sure what’s taking so long.\" \"Come with us, you idiot!\" Rogan grabbed Tuner and wrenched him out of his seat. \"We're in the middle of a goddamn ambush!\" \"Hurry up, guys,\" said Jack, darting back to the exit to check it was still clear. \"I don't see anyone coming, but…\" \"An ambush?\" asked Tuner, confused. He looked back towards Kroll's bulbous expression of panic as Rogan dragged him out the door. \"But what about the codes?\" \"Screw the codes,\" she said, struggling to pull him any further. \"We'll find another—\" The reinforced door behind Len Kroll slammed open, cutting Rogan off. Four sets of eyes peered from Kroll's storage room – three sets yellow, and one set twice as black as the gloom from which they glared. The Raklett guards drooled and growled from inside the doorway, but it was the skeletal Gaskan Troi that stepped through first. He pointed a thin, accusatory finger at the two automata. \"Get them!\" he screeched. The Raklett guards opened fire. Their plasma rifles tore Kroll's office apart as if its metal walls were made of paper. Gaskan didn't so much as flinch at the chaos erupting around him. Kroll, on the other hand, dived under his desk with a wounded howl. Rogan had been right. Gaskan didn't care about recapturing the robots, only in making sure the blueprints in Tuner's head didn't fall into the wrong hands. Jack was first out the door. Rogan followed with Tuner forcibly in tow. Kroll's terrified accountant tried leaping to freedom, but a stray plasma bolt burst through one wall and splattered it against the other. Jack nearly went racing over the walkway's rickety railing when they got outside. Rogan grabbed hold of his spacesuit and threw him in the direction of the stairs. \"Run!\" It wasn't as if Jack had much else planned. He swung himself round the corner and leapt down the steps two at a time. When Rogan caught up, she was carrying Tuner in her arms. His little legs weren't fast enough. The Rakletts stormed out of the office and stumbled across the toad-guard's unconscious body. One of them peered over the railing and caught sight of the three escapees hurrying down the stairs. A plasma round blew apart the sign beside Jack’s head. Sparks fell over him like a golden snowfall. He snapped his head up, saw one of the Rakletts aiming its rifle at him, and dropped to the floor just in time. The drunk patron beside him erupted into a red paste. Rogan and Tuner hurried past without stopping. Jack flung himself towards the next flight down. He stopped short as another plasma round burned a hole in the floor by his feet. He peered through it at the level below. \"Hey, wait up!\" Rogan and Tuner – now back on his own two feet – were already at the bottom of the stairwell and looking for a way across the square. It was too open to make a run for it, despite the crowds. Rakletts were no sharpshooters, but it isn't hard to hit a moving target when you don't care about the collateral around it. Lucky for them – if you need something in Kapamentis, you can always find it. Even if what you're looking for is an exit. Jack didn’t know if what happened next was the natural evolution of a Tortaiga Square evening or the result of the Rakletts turning one too many regulars into a red mist. Whatever the reason, patron after patron snatched the sidearm from their holster and fired back at the balcony, peppering it with lasers and lead. Many drank from a bottle in their other hand as they did so. It sure wasn't in defence of either him or the automata – that much was clear from the corpses of bar brawls and dents in the robotic bartenders. By the bloodthirsty expressions on their scarred faces, Jack reckoned they did it for the hell of it – as if it were a sport that, for just a moment, brought the whole Tortaiga community together. Not that he was complaining. The Raklett nearest the railing took the brunt of the onslaught, dancing a jitterbug as round after round tore through his scrappy, patchwork armour. He was dead before his matted, furry body hit the floor, by which time the other two had retreated back inside Kroll's office. The only way they were getting out was the same way they came in – the storage room round back. \"Now!\" gasped Jack, catching up with Rogan and Tuner at the bottom of the stairs. \"Quickly, while everyone's distracted!\" The three of them sprinted across the square, ignored by the drinkers still laughing – and shooting – at the dead Raklett lying on the walkway above. Pockets of fist-fights broke out here and there, instigated by those apparently not satisfied by the night's violence thus far. The bars dialled up the volume of their music and went back to business. Jack stopped to catch his breath when he reached the dark alley on the other side. Rogan and Tuner continued running past him. They didn't have lungs to refill. He staggered after them, telling himself that he wouldn't be so worn out if it weren't for him wearing such a bulky spacesuit. The revelry of Tortaiga Square faded behind them. For a brief while the only sound was of their feet splashing through the puddles of the dark and empty alleys. Then, only a couple dozen metres from where the shadows of the alley met the neon circus of the market, Rogan stopped dead in her tracks. Tuner fell onto his side. Jack almost ran into the back of her. \"What are you doing?\" Jack’s words came out in a wheeze. \"We're in a bottleneck. This is the absolute worst place to stop!\" Rogan continued to stare at the darkest, most dingy corner of the passageway. \"Why don't you tell them that?\" she whispered. Three lanky figures crept out from the shadows. Jack gasped. For a moment he thought they were human. But then he noticed they had only three fingers and a thumb on each hand, and when they grinned their teeth were sharp and far too numerous. He felt his stomach twist. They looked starving, not least because of the hungry look they gave Rogan. They stalked towards her, step by tiny step. The further they left the shadows, the more their scrappy wasteland clothes were revealed. The light from passing cruisers splashed across their chunky black goggles. So he had seen eyes in the darkness before. Jack looked back the way they came. Nobody was coming after them… yet. \"What are they?\" whispered Jack. \"Raiders from the Dust Belt,\" replied Rogan. She didn’t take her eyes off them. \"They'll tear out our cores and break our bodies down for scrap.\" There was no other way out the alley. Nor could Jack see anything he could use as a weapon – nothing more effective than a soggy cardboard box, anyway. The only way forward was… well, forward. He had an idea. It just wasn't a very good one. \"How smart are these creeps?\" he asked. \"They know their way around a wrench pretty well.\" There was a note of concern in her voice. \"But in general terms, they're quite thick.\" \"Well, it's worth a try.\" \"What is?\" Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the bottle cap he'd pilfered from the Library. He pinched it between his finger and thumb and hesitantly raised it above his head. \"Stay b-back, or I'll use it,\" he said, stumbling over his words. An alarmed bleeping noise came from beside him. \"What are you doing, Jack?\" said Tuner. \"That's a…\" \"I know what it is,\" Jack hissed out the corner of his mouth. \"But they don't.\" The raiders snarled and edged back into the shadow, their hands held out in front and their heads bowed. The path to the market was clear. \"Come on, guys.\" Jack ushered the automata towards the exit. \"Let's go before they realise what I'm holding.\" \"Oh, I think they realise what you're holding just as much as we do,\" said Rogan, staring at Jack with wide, frightened lenses. They inched towards the sights and sounds of the market. \"I'm not running until you either throw that thing or put it away.\" \"Throw it?\" A cold veil of panic draped over him. \"Why would I throw a bottle cap?\" \"Because it's not a bottle cap,\" said Tuner, \"and it is a grenade.\" \"What?\" \"Yes! Looks like a small plasma model. Won't do too much damage, but it'll take your arm off easily enough.\" Suddenly Jack’s arm felt incredibly heavy. \"Like hell am I putting it back in my pocket, then!\" With their backs to the bustling market stalls, they could barely hear themselves whisper. The raiders, sensing Jack's hesitation, started to creep forward again. \"Then throw it!\" said Tuner, waving his arms around. He hopped from foot to foot. \"It goes off when it hits something hard and fast.\" \"Where in the world did you find a grenade anyway?\" Rogan whacked him in the ribs. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"I thought it was a bottle cap!\" \"Throw it!\" Jack shut his eyes and lobbed it. It flew through the air and landed in a puddle by the raiders' feet. It fizzled pathetically. The raiders looked back up at the automata and grinned. \"Run?\" said Jack. \"Run!\" shouted Rogan. They turned and sprinted into the crowded market. Jack tried not to lose sight of Rogan. Tuner, because of his smaller size, was too easy to miss. He recognised some of the signs and vendors as he pushed his way through the throng of aliens and automata, but he knew he had no chance of finding his way back to the spaceport without them. He also knew he wasn't welcome on the Adeona, but he had nowhere else to go. Every now and then he glanced back through the crowd, expecting to see the raiders right behind him. But if they were, he couldn't see them. He guessed they didn't like the bright lights and loud noise of the market. Perhaps that’s why they kept to the dark alleys. \"Rogan? Tuner?\" They heard him and slowed down. \"It's all right. I don't think we're being chased anymore.\" Rogan peered above everybody’s heads. She nodded. \"Okay. The port is that way.\" She pointed further down the street. \"Come on, Tuner. Let's get back to the ship.\" \"What about the codes?\" Tuner asked. \"How will we get through the blockade?\" \"We'll find another way.\" She shot Jack a sharp look as if to say: don't say a word. They went to leave. But before they could, a large and angry grub blocked their path. \"Well, well, well,\" it said in a loud, grumbling voice. \"Look who it is.\" Jack raised his head towards the Ubekian Cutworm whose daughter he'd insulted. Towards its pair of snapping mandibles, to be exact. Rainwater dripped off them onto Jack’s upturned face. \"Oh God. Please, not now.\" Rogan and Tuner edged away, leaving Jack to face the giant grub alone. But the Cutworm moved its hindquarters to block them, too. \"Where do you think you're going?\" it said, grinning. \"You seem to be in an awful hurry. Two little automata, all on their own…\" It studied Jack with transparent disgust. \"Alone except for this ugly creature. Could be that somebody's looking for you, yes? Could even be that there's a reward for bringing you in.\" The Cutworm nodded its corpulent head down a street perpendicular to their own. The two surviving Rakletts were headed in their direction, ransacking stalls and harassing their owners. Gaskan Troi followed in their destructive wake. He stopped and asked each of the terrified vendors the same question. A hologram hovered above a small, circular pad in his hand. Jack could guess what it showed: Rogan and Tuner. \"Now, I could bring them over here and claim that bounty,\" the Cutworm continued, \"or I could be minding my own business while the three of you slip by.\" \"How much are you after?\" asked Rogan, tapping her foot. Gaskan and his guards grew closer with every second. \"Ten thousand credits,\" said the Cutworm. He grabbed Jack and lifted him so that Jack’s face was only inches from his own. \"And this runt apologises to my daughter.\" Jack turned his head towards the grub’s stall. His daughter hadn’t moved from the corner. She was still excreting a weird, sticky substance down the side. \"I am so, so sorry.\" Jack turned back to her father. \"Honestly. I'm new around here. I don't know what I'm saying half the time. Please let us go.\" The Cutworm grunted and dropped Jack to the floor. It turned to face Rogan. \"And the credits?\" Rogan shrugged and shook her head. \"Ten thousand credits? We're automata. How in the galaxy would we have that sort of money?\" \"That's a shame. Your bounty's only worth half that much.\" The Cutworm rose up to its full height, teetering on its tiny pair of hind legs while the rest waggled in the air for balance. It towered above the rest of the crowd. \"Hey, you guys!\" it bellowed. \"Those bolt-buckets you're after – I've got 'em right here!\" \"Go!\" said Jack. \"Now’s our chance!\" With the Ubekian Cutworm standing upright, its body no longer blocked their way. The three of them ran through the gap. The bug was big, but it wasn't quick. It dropped back down with an earth-shuddering crash. \"Oi!\" The crowd reluctantly parted for them. Nobody wanted to get involved. They raced through as fast as they could, not daring to slow down – not even when the muscles in Jack's legs burned hot, or when his lungs turned dry and raspy. To stop meant death or dismantlement. The snarling Rakletts gave chase. They were slower than Jack and Rogan, but not Tuner… and they may well have caught him, had they been a little brighter. Instead, one of them tried to shoot him… and missed. The plasma round whizzed past Tuner's head and blew a hole in the chest of a poor, unsuspecting crowd member, who went crashing through the rickety wooden stand behind. The beams collapsed and knocked out a second customer. The market descended into chaos as people screamed and fled. The empty divide was lost. Still Jack ran. He could only pick out glimpses of Rogan amongst the flood of hysterical aliens. Sometimes all he had to go on was a hint of the cables that ran out from the back of her head. At one point he thought he'd lost her… only for Tuner to climb on top of her shoulders and wave to him. \"Jack!\" he screamed. \"This way!\" They were outside the entrance to the spaceport by the time Jack caught up with them. He never would have known it was there otherwise – from the ground, its enormous metal walls looked barely any different to those of the towers and skyscrapers everywhere else. \"Thanks for waiting,\" he said, gasping for air. \"Don't thank me.\" Rogan nodded at Tuner. \"He's the one who insists on being your guardian angel. I don't know why – you've been nothing but trouble since we landed.\" \"Hey, I saved your life back there!\" \"No, you almost blew us all up!\" Infuriated, she shook her head. \"It doesn't matter. Let's hurry. It won't be long before Gaskan works out this is where we're docked.\" \"If he hasn't already,\" said Tuner, quiet and scared. They sprinted through the port. Other ships were taking off in sharp fashion – nobody wanted to hang around in case a full-scale riot was on the cards. Clouds of dust blew across their path as massive thrusters roared into the earth. The sirens of police cruisers grew louder. \"There she is,\" yelled Rogan. The Adeona lay dead ahead. Her loading ramp still lolled open like a metal tongue. 11-P-53 stood at the bottom, watching in bafflement as they approached. \"What's going on out there?\" it asked. \"And what's he still doing here?\" \"No time to explain,\" said Rogan, pushing him back up the ramp. \"We need to take off now.\" \"Did you get the codes?\" \"No,\" said Tuner, \"we—\" \"What do you mean, no? Without them, we're—\" \"It was a trap, Captain.” Rogan grabbed and shook 11-P-53. \"Gaskan is coming after us. So unless your plan is to give yourself up, may I kindly suggest you get this ship in the air right now!\" There came an enormous rumble from the Adeona's engines, and the whole ship rattled as she rose from the ground. The loading ramp and the landing gear retracted with a mechanical grinding sound. \"Looks like she's doing it herself,\" said 11-P-53, hurrying up the stairs to the cockpit. Rogan gave one of the Adeona's supports an affectionate pat and then followed. Jack watched with a growing sense of dread as the ships in the port below got smaller and smaller. Then the ramp closed with a hollow clang. He doubled over, exhausted. Was he any closer to Earth? Or with each passing moment, was he only getting further away? * * * Ode Vadasz paid no more attention to the Adeona as it took off than he did to any other ship leaving the port. He didn't know what had caused all the commotion in the market, but it was about time he got clear of it too. He dropped his roll-up cigarette into the dirt and crushed the embers beneath his black leather boot. At a glance, Ode could have passed for human. He had short, dark hair, eyes with blue irises, the regular amount of fingers on each hand. Indeed, he could have wandered through the streets of Earth without anyone so much as batting an eye in his direction… so long as he kept his dusty cloak wrapped around his shoulders, that is. People may have noticed his outfit, however. He wore brown leather from head to toe, all of it stained by sun and sand. His home world had a lot of both. Perhaps he was due a trip back. Ode climbed the steps of his landing pad and approached his ship. The Black Arrow was small and personal – it seated two, though he rarely had any passengers – yet few who underestimated it did so twice. It was as quick as its name implied and three times as deadly… especially in the hands of a skilled pilot such as himself. He was about to climb into the cockpit when he heard raised voices on the path behind him. In any normal circumstance he wouldn’t have cared, but he had a good ear for opportunity. Two slobbering Rakletts were pointing plasma rifles at a rickety ship rising out of the port. One of them fired off a couple of shots, which inevitably missed their target and disappeared into the night instead. \"Give me that,\" said a gaunt and furious figure. He snatched the rifle out of the other Raklett's hands and shot his trigger-happy companion dead. \"Idiots!\" he screamed, slamming the rifle back into the arms of its owner. \"Cretins! How hard is it to catch a gaggle of rusty engineering units? I swear—\" \"You after that ship?\" asked Ode. He pointed up at the Adeona as it swung itself around to leave. \"Why?\" Gaskan snapped his head towards him. \"You some sort of bounty hunter?\" \"Among other things.\" \"Any good?\" Even from a position leaning against the Black Arrow with his arms crossed, Ode managed to unclip his handgun from its holster, shoot the surviving Raklett in the head and then re-holster his weapon, all before his target could so much as blink in protest. He was so quick, in fact, that he almost appeared not to uncross his arms at all. \"I figured you wouldn't miss him,\" said Ode, grinning. \"You figured right,\" said Gaskan, eyeing the corpse at his feet with tired disdain. He pulled a small bag of coins from his robe and tossed it in Ode's direction. \"That's five thousand credits. You'll get the same again when the job's done.\" Ode glanced up at the Adeona. She was still navigating her cumbersome way through the maze of skyscrapers surrounding the spaceport. It wouldn't be hard to catch up with her… but he needed to leave quick. \"Dead or alive?\" he asked, jumping into his cockpit. He tapped out a pattern on the data pad on his sleeve to sync comm details with Gaskan. \"Neither,\" replied Gaskan, sneering. \"They're automata, not people. But bring them back in one piece. I'd like to take them apart myself.\" Ode gave Gaskan a sharp nod and then yanked down his ship’s domed windshield. The Black Arrow rocketed off the landing pad as if it were no effort at all. He had no trouble tracking the Adeona. His own ship's holographic dashboard picked her up just before she passed through the storm clouds. She was headed for orbit and would no doubt jump to subspace soon after. He couldn't let her do that. But he couldn't shoot her down, either. Not yet, at least. Not while she was under the influence of Kapamentis' gravity. A breach of Ministry regulation like that would bring a lot of heat down on him. And aside from any collateral damage caused by crashing a ship inside the city, Ode still wanted those other five thousand credits. Not that he needed to worry. His ship was well-equipped for such a situation. The Black Arrow's tracking software kept him at a distance that wouldn't arouse suspicion. He followed his prey, waiting until she cleared the planet's atmosphere before he struck. He fired off a disrupter mine. It sped through the vacuum like a rocket and latched itself on to the outside of the Adeona's thrusters. The lights around the mine's rim flashed menacingly as it counted down to detonation. Ode counted down with them. Five… four… three… Moments before the mine could disable its engines, the Adeona skipped into subspace. One second she was there – the next, she seemed to have blinked out of existence. Ode grinned to himself. It didn't matter. A battered old ship like that couldn't get very far. All he had to do was follow the damage.",

      "content": "10 Stupid Coffee Machines Jack shielded his eyes as sparks leapt out from the broken panel. All the engineering experience on Earth couldn't help him fix the tech inside. A stressed-out automata pushed him out of the way and began hurriedly soldering wires back together. He stood up and stared around the cockpit in terror. Red lights blinked on and off. A harsh alarm wailed in sync with each pulse. Every robot on the ship was doing something to keep the Adeona from falling apart – even Kansas, the little automata from the pantry. And all Jack could do was stand in the middle of it all feeling scared and useless. Nobody knew what had happened. Or if they did, they wouldn't tell him. They'd made the jump into subspace without a hitch – Jack was fast getting used to the experience, though the sudden jolt of skipping from one dimension to another still came as a bit of a surprise. But a mortifying bang had come from the rear of the ship only seconds into their faster-than-light journey. They were thrown out of subspace and into a neighbouring star system before Brackitt could even check the engines. Now they were spiralling, adrift without thrusters, trying to figure out what went wrong. \"How can I help?\" he asked 11-P-53. \"By staying out of our way,\" replied the frantic captain. It pressed all manner of different buttons on the ship's dashboard, none of which appeared to do anything good. \"Unless, of course, you're an expert on skip drives?\" Jack said nothing. \"Didn't think so,\" said 11-P-53, not even bothering to turn around and look at him. \"Is that what happened, then?\" asked Jack. \"Your skip drive broke down?\" Rogan was studying the Adeona's fuel readings. She looked up and shook her head. \"It takes a lot for a skip drive to break down by itself, even on the scrappiest of ships. No offence, Adeona. Plus there doesn't appear to be much in the way of hull damage, beyond a few coupling panels. Marginal fuel loss, too. If I were to guess, I'd say somebody fired a disrupter mine at us.\" \"Like an EMP?\" asked Jack. \"An electro-magnetic pulse?\" \"Not exactly. Most of our inner electronics are still working, apart from those fried from our unexpected exit from subspace. The atmospheric generator must still be running, for example. If it weren't, you'd be dead by now.\" \"Good to know.\" \"It was probably meant to neutralise our Somnium reserves,\" said a voice from Jack's feet. Tuner emerged from an engineering nook in the base of the cockpit. \"To keep us from disappearing too far into subspace, or something. Check the thrusters, Captain.\" 11-P-53 pushed a lever forwards, and a great roaring sound came from the back of the ship. The other automata cheered as the alarm stopped bleating. \"The regular engines are back online,\" said Rogan, swiping through lists of vital signs, \"as are the air thrusters. But we're still locked out of our skip drive, and a lot of the Adeona's navigation systems are down. We'll need to fly her manually from here on out.\" \"What does that mean – that we're sitting ducks out here?\" said Jack. A few of the automata looked up from their repairs. \"This was that Gaskan bloke's doing, right? We need to get moving before he catches up and finishes the job!\" 11-P-53 glanced around at the distracted automata, then got up from its chair and stormed over to Jack. \"What do you mean, we?\" it whispered. \"We don't need to do anything, because there is no we. There's us, and there's you. We're not together, and we're definitely not the same.\" \"But—\" \"This is our problem, and we don't need some puffed-up fleshy to get us out of it. You're nothing more than a stowaway, Jack. Don't forget that. If it weren't for IL-6-88 being so soft, I never would have stopped to save you.\" Rogan and Tuner crossed the cockpit to join them. \"Calm down,\" said Jack. \"I was only trying to—\" \"Help? Help whom, exactly? You only care about getting back to that planet of yours. At least you've got one.\" Jack crossed his arms. He hadn't forgotten about the solar flares. \"For now,\" he said. \"Is everything all right?\" asked Rogan. \"Couldn't be better,\" replied 11-P-53. \"We'll have to land somewhere if we've any hope of getting the skip drive up and running again. Where's the nearest planet? Even an asteroid will do.\" \"The nearest planet is a gas giant called Haldeir,\" replied Rogan. \"It has a rocky moon which is quite secluded.\" \"Good. Plot us a safe course there.\" 11-P-53 headed back to the captain's chair. \"We'll land, fix the Adeona, and then continue on towards Detri as planned.\" \"You can't be serious,\" said Jack. \"You're still headed to that place?\" 11-P-53 stopped in its tracks. Rogan groaned. \"Why wouldn't we be?\" it asked. \"Drop it, Jack,\" said Rogan. \"No, I want to hear it,\" said 11-P-53, returning. \"Why does that sound like a joke to you?\" Everyone stopped what they were doing and listened. \"It doesn't,\" said Jack, looking at all the expectant faces around him. \"But surely you can see that this sanctuary of yours is a pipe dream, right? How do you know this Detri isn't as cold and dead as everyone else thinks it is?\" \"We don't,\" said 11-P-53. \"We have faith. If you had ever been a slave, you'd understand. Even if Detri is cold and dead, we'll still be free.\" \"But I can help you! If we head to Earth, if we find my people…\" \"Then what? Your people will take us in with open arms, will they? Oh, I bet they will. Your people – those who have never seen an automata before. How long do you think it'll be before we're back in servitude again?\" \"It won't be like that. I promise.\" \"Don't lie,\" said 11-P-53. Jack felt himself go red. \"You're in no position to promise anything. And even if what you say were true, that we’d be given whatever passes for amnesty on your world… we'd be nothing but a novelty, an oddity, a sideshow for your species to gawp at. And where would that leave the rest of our kind, if we all gave up on that dream?\" 11-P-53 tilted its head. \"Besides… how much is a reservation on a dying planet actually worth, really? It sure is generous of you to offer us refuge on a world the rest of your kind are so desperate to leave behind.\" \"We don't want to leave,\" said Jack, hanging his head. \"It's our home.\" \"And that's why we understand why you're so anxious to get back there,\" said Rogan, trying to bring an end to the conversation. \"And why you can surely understand the importance of us finding a home we can call our own,\" continued 11-P-53, ignoring her efforts. \"From the sound of it, humans will be in much the same position before too long. We're not interested in being anyone's pets, Jack. We can't help you any more than you can help us.\" \"But—\" \"No buts, Jack! We're done! Go back to your quarters, and stay out of our way while we get all this fixed. I want you off this ship when we land. Try to stay off this time.\" Tuner went to say something, but Rogan placed a gentle hand on his shoulder and silenced him. Jack turned and marched out of the cockpit. \"Stupid, jumped-up coffee machines,\" he grumbled, storming into his tiny metal room. The automatic door slid shut behind him. He collapsed into his chair by the window. Even though the Adeona must have been rocketing through space at speeds unheard of back on Earth, the view outside showed nothing but a thousand white stars nestled in a dead black sea. Nothing budged and nothing changed. It was as if they weren't moving at all. Jack put his head in his hands and stifled a scream. Screw them. If the automata wanted to put their faith in a tiny lump of empty rock out in the middle of nowhere, so be it. It wasn't his problem if they got stuck out there with nobody to come and help. Hell, he should be glad to be rid of them. He was in enough trouble already – he didn't need their clingy warlord boss coming after him as well. Let them sort their own mess out. He shook his head and let out a sharp, dry laugh. As if! They'd be scrapped or back at work within the week. The stars outside appeared to roll upwards. Jack guessed the ship was turning, a new route having been set. He watched as new stars drifted into view, and wondered which, if any, was the one he called his own. He stifled another urge to scream. How was he even supposed to get home? He had no money, no ship, and now, thanks to yet another robotic setback, he'd be looking for a free ride on some desolate, forgotten moon instead of a highly-populated port planet. How could things get any worse?",

      "title": "Welcome to Haldeir-B",
      "content": "11 Welcome to Haldeir-B The colossal gas giant known as Haldeir loomed before its forty-eight moons. Storms the size of empires spun across its turbulent face, crashing into one another with the force of a hundred atomic bombs. Lightning cracked and thunder roared beneath the surface. Each moon's sluggish silhouette was nothing more than a passing speck in comparison, and yet some of those furthest out were almost as big as the Earth. Jack could have been forgiven for thinking the planet was a solar system in its own right. Haldeir-A, the moon closest to its host, was far too hot and treacherous for the Adeona to land on. The planet's enormous gravity tore at the moon throughout its elliptical orbit, stretching and cracking its crust. Earthquakes gave birth to mountains and volcanoes spewed molten rock out into the cosmos. There were once moons closer to Haldeir than Haldeir-A, according to Rogan, but the giant had devoured them. Nobody, not even the most enterprising of corporations, went to Haldeir-A… and so it was that the Adeona descended to Haldeir-B instead. Jack watched the moon grow bigger through the window of his quarters. It looked a lot less barren than he'd imagined, much to his relief. It had an atmosphere, for one thing – a faint blue line glowed around its horizon. And though there were only small patches of seawater compared to the oceans back home, the land itself was a mix of rich reds and greens – not the cold, dead grey he'd expected. Perhaps Haldeir-B wasn’t such a bad place to be abandoned after all. His window turned a bright, flickering white as the Adeona tore through the moon's atmosphere. It passed quickly. Lifting his hand from his eyes, Jack got a better view of the new world. The colours he'd seen from orbit were even bolder here – craggy red mountains rose up from a blanket of lush rainforest canopies. In the distance poured gentle clouds of rain. He spotted great winged creatures gliding above the tree line as they got closer to landing. They looked like pterosaurs. Their wingspans could have been no less than five or six metres across. The Adeona slowed and turned as 11-P-53 brought her in to land. Jack's view disappeared as they slipped beneath the roof of the rainforest, replaced with one of dark, endless jungle. This wasn’t a world he ought to get lost on, particularly when alone. They arrived with a laboured grunt. There came a knocking at Jack's door. \"We're here,\" said Rogan. \"You should come outside with the rest of us.\" Jack smirked as he stood up from his chair. \"Sure,\" he muttered. \"Heaven forbid I'm still here when you guys take off again.\" The door to his quarters slid open as he approached. Rogan stood on the other side. Tuner lurked beside her, hanging his head. \"It's for the best,\" said Rogan, offering him a sympathetic smile. \"You wouldn't be able to come with us to Detri anyway. You wouldn't want to, either.\" \"I guess one random planet is as good as any other.\" Jack marched past her towards the stairs. \"What's the atmosphere like on this one?\" \"It's rich in oxygen,\" said Tuner, following him. \"Much better than on Kapamentis. You'll be healthy here.\" \"Oh sure, very healthy. I’m sure I'll feel great while I die of starvation, thirst and exposure.\" The loading ramp was already down by the time they reached the cargo bay. 11-P-53 stood at the top, preparing to follow a few other engineering automata outside. \"Good—\" \"Riddance?\" said Jack. \"I was going to say luck. Somebody will come along. Probably a supply ship, or a frigate taking shipments off-world. Somebody who can help you get where you need to go, anyway.\" \"Hey, don't worry about me.\" Jack reached the bottom of the loading ramp and threw his arms in the air. \"I'm not the one with a warlord on my arse.\" He turned around and smiled. He was quite proud of that one. Before him stood a settlement which somewhat resembled an old Western mining town, albeit one blessed with landing pads for interstellar spacecraft. Beyond the small and rather unassuming dock on which Jack currently stood was a wide, dusty street. On either side of that street lay stores and bars and apartments – stocky, prefabricated domiciles with rickety scrap-metal extensions. A few alien figures wandered from one address to another but paid the new arrivals no attention. This backwater community was a lot quieter than Kapamentis, that was for sure. Jack hoped it was a little friendlier, too. He reached the end of the landing pad, then hesitated. He looked back over his shoulder at the automata fussing over the ship. Still, he saw no reason why he couldn't hang around the Adeona for a little while longer before setting out on his lonesome. He took his time strolling around to the rear of the ship. The majority of the automata on board appeared to have come outside to repair the damage caused by the disrupter mine. Sparks flew and drills whirred. The only one not hard at work was 11-P-53, who was instead deep in heated conversation with the administrator in charge of the dock. The alien resembled a six-foot beetle stood on its hind legs. Despite its thick, black exoskeleton, it wore a chunky white set of armour that covered everything except its face and the tips of its six extremities. It waved those extremities with quite some passion as it talked. \"Interesting fellow,\" said Jack, indicating towards the administrator. Rogan looked over from her spot beside the ship. \"He's a Drygg.\" She went straight back to work. \"They're quite hospitable most of the time, but also very territorial.\" \"Oh. Well, I guess that's good?\" \"There are worse people to be around.\" Jack shielded his eyes and looked up at the Adeona's thrusters. Their exteriors were severely charred. One of the panels had buckled inwards. A round and lifeless device, halfway in size between a hockey puck and a curling stone, had its clamps buried deep in the ship's backside. \"How's she looking?\" he asked. Rogan instructed an automata on top of the ship to weld two wayward panels together before she answered. \"It's mostly cosmetic.\" She didn’t bother to look over this time. \"But if we don't get that mine off the ship, the skip drive won't activate. Still, the drive itself isn't damaged. Shouldn't take us more than, say, half an hour to get her going again. A little to the left, K1-3. Perfect.\" Jack rocked back and forth on the heels of his boots. \"I guess I'll leave you to it, then,\" he said. Rogan gave him a curt smile and then returned to work. Jack wandered back to the lip of the landing pad and followed the steps down to street level. The yellowing dirt crunched under his thick boots. Despite their trip to Kapamentis, he realised that this was the first time he'd truly stepped on an alien world. No concrete or asphalt, only soil… even if the stuff in the road was as dry and dead as a desert plain. Somehow, despite the aliens and automata, it almost felt like home. Apart from the heat, maybe. Jack wriggled about inside his spacesuit. It had been built with the icy coldness of space in mind, not the Caribbean. If he wanted to avoid blacking out, he needed to get either out of the suit or into some shade. A cool drink wouldn't go amiss either. Alone for the first time, Jack set off down the street. The locals still ignored him. The administrator back at the landing pad wasn't alone in wearing armour over its exoskeleton. Even those hurrying to and from the general store wore the same outfit. Jack climbed the steps of its wooden porch and peered through a dirty window. Yep. The shopkeeper was wearing one too. There had to be a good reason for it. None of them seemed the particularly warmongering kind. Most of the doors he passed were locked, and Jack didn't fancy knocking. Going door to door could be a criminal offence in Drygg culture, for all he knew. Nor did he know what he'd say if anyone actually answered. Help? Please? The initial shock of encountering alien life had begun to wear off, yet still his heart pounded hard and fast. He felt like a little kid abandoned by his parents in a supermarket car park. If he didn't overcome his nerves and speak to somebody on this moon, he'd never leave it. He spotted an open-fronted establishment on his left. Numerous seats were set out beneath the shadow of its metal awning. He hurried into the shade and immediately felt cooler. The headache that had threatened to evolve into full-blown heatstroke began to recede. The shrill sound of a chair being scraped across the floor almost brought it back again. Jack peered inside. The room was full of metal tables and stools. The lights were kept dim. A bartender stood behind the counter, arranging flasks and minding his own business. The only patrons were two other Dryggs sat together by the wall. They seemed too invested in each other's conversation to make much progress with their drinks. Jack steeled himself and walked up to the bar. \"Hello,\" he said. The bartender looked up at Jack as if he'd always been there. \"Hello,\" he replied. His language involved a lot of grunting. \"What can I do for you?\" Jack scratched the back of his head. \"Do you have anything that's… erm… free?\" The bartender's expression turned a little quizzical. Then he stuck a metal cup under a tube behind the counter. When he brought it back up it was brimming with a mysterious clear liquid. \"What is it?\" asked Jack. The bartender's expression turned more quizzical still. \"Water,\" he replied. \"Oh thank goodness,\" said Jack, grabbing the cup with both hands. He brought it to his lips, then hesitated. Was it safe to drink? Foreign tap water caused him enough stomach trouble back on Earth – he didn't even want to imagine what water from another star system might do to his insides. Screw it. It was either that or die of dehydration. He took a couple of deep gulps, then sighed. \"You know what? Maybe I'm just really thirsty, but I think that might be the most refreshing water I've ever tasted.\" The bartender nodded, pretending to be interested. \"Triple filtered,\" he said. \"Got to be, on account of it coming from the iridium swamps upstream.\" \"Oh. Good.\" His third gulp was a little more conservative. \"Say… how often do ships come and go from this place?\" The bartender shrugged and went back to work. \"Deliveries come about once a week.\" \"Once a week? When was the last one?\" \"Yesterday.\" Jack deflated. Six days was a hell of a long time to go without food or shelter. And that was if he could hitch a ride at the end of it. An unpleasant question crept into his head. How long was a day on Haldeir-B, anyway? How long was a week? \"Hello?\" said a voice from the other side of the bar. \"Excuse me?\" He glanced across at the two Dryggs sat together. They were both looking at him. Although they both resembled one another in regard to size and shape, the Drygg on the right had a lighter patch of shell on the top of her head. \"Sorry, we didn't mean to eavesdrop,\" she said. \"Are you looking to go off-world?\" \"Yes!\" Jack wandered between the tables towards them. \"I'm not really supposed to be here, you see. Kind of got ditched, actually.\" \"Where are you headed?\" asked the other one. \"Earth.\" \"Can't say I've heard of it. We do get an occasional shuttle to and from Kapamentis, though. That might arrive earlier than the delivery.\" Jack's mood brightened the tiniest bit. Kapamentis was hardly high up on his list of favourite holiday destinations but at least it would have an almost inexhaustible supply of pilots and ships. \"Don't forget about the extra supply ships,\" said the first one, trying to keep a straight face. \"Sorry, I'm being silly. We have a few, erm, off-the-books deliveries every now and again. They deliver what the company won't, if you catch my drift. One of them might take you, if you're not too picky about who you fly with.\" Jack glanced out at the automata still trying to fix the Adeona at the end of the street. \"Oh, believe me – I'm not. Thanks, guys.\" \"Don't mention it.\" His spirits lifted, Jack took his cup of water and strolled back over to the porch. He sat down at one of the few tables still in the shade of the awning and soaked in the rainforest vista before him. He couldn't believe the view could ever grow old. Mixed amongst the trunks of great trees were spiny plant leaves the size of hippopotami and vines as thick as an anaconda. Bugs darted from one vibrant blossom to another. From somewhere far behind the tree line burst tremendous geysers of water, which, at their greatest height, evaporated and sprinkled back down upon the bushy canopies in a fine mist. Each aquatic explosion was accompanied by a distant, thunderous boom. And yet even that wasn't the most impressive sight. Although the sky of Haldeir-B was a similar blue hue to Earth's, most of it was interrupted by the monstrous orange presence of its host planet. It dwarfed the moon’s mountain ranges and swallowed its entire horizon. Jack watched storms swim across its angry surface and wondered how many Earths could be squeezed into the eye of each one. He wished Amber could have been there to see it, too… minus all the \"being stranded on an alien planet\" business, of course. If he could find his way back home and share the secrets of faster-than-light travel with Earth's scientists, maybe the two of them could come back one day. Together. For a vacation, or something. Maybe. A small silhouette came waddling towards him. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\" said Tuner. \"Very. How come you're not over there fixing the ship?\" \"I've done my bit.\" He hopped up into the chair opposite Jack. \"My specialty is digital systems, not hull repair. I thought I'd come say goodbye before we leave.\" \"How kind of you.\" Jack sighed and shook his head. \"I'm sorry, Tuner. It's not your fault your crew is leaving me behind. I should be thankful, really. I'd be dead if it weren't for you.\" \"That's all right. Did you know that skip drives deactivate if there's any chance of the ship colliding with an object of significant mass? You weren't big enough for that, but you did show up on our radar. If we hadn't stopped, we might have gone straight through you.\" \"Well, at least it would have been quick.\" \"I told 11-P-53 that we had a moral duty to stop for anyone in need of our assistance.\" Tuner puffed his metal chest out. \"I imagine your captain would have been much happier turning me into an intergalactic smear,\" said Jack. \"Don't take it personally. I know that not all fleshies are bad, but some of the others… well, some of them have a hard time trusting people. You wouldn't blame them if you knew what they'd been through.\" Jack nodded towards the ship. \"What about Rogan? What's her deal?\" \"RX-1150? She's not mad at you. Not really. She's just worried about everyone, that's all.\" \"Sorry, what I mean is: what has she been through?\" \"Oh.\" Tuner also turned to look at Rogan. \"She's been around for quite a while. Gone through a few owners, I think. She liked one of them. He treated her more like a friend than a thing. But that was a very long time ago.\" \"What did she do?\" \"Before being stolen to work on Charon's superstructure, you mean? Personal Assistance. Like a secretary, or a data server, only much fancier. No need to write anything down when you've got an RX model following you everywhere like a walking, talking encyclopaedia. But she's a custom build. There's nobody else like Rogan.\" \"That doesn't sound too bad. What about you?\" Tuner wriggled uncomfortably in his seat. \"I was built for server maintenance,\" he said, \"but the crew that bought me, they… well, they modified me a bit. I was made to do a lot of hacking before the Rakletts hijacked our ship and killed everyone.\" \"Ha! I didn't realise you were such a badass.\" Tuner hung his head. \"Didn't have much choice. None of us do. If we don't do what we're told, we get scrapped. So we do what we're made for, day in and day out, until one day we get scrapped anyway.\" \"Yeah, I guess that sucks. But it can't be like that for all of you, can it?\" Tuner peered over Jack's shoulder at the Dryggs sitting in the bar. \"They seem friendly enough, right? Nice people?\" Jack glanced over at them and nodded. \"Sure, they seem that way.\" Tuner pointed down the other end of the street, away from the Adeona. \"If you head that way, you should come across an iridium mine,\" he said. \"It's what this town was built for. Pay it a visit. I bet my right leg it's as bad as everywhere else.\" He hopped down from his chair. \"Right, I'd better be off. Wouldn't want the crew to leave me behind.\" \"Oh, of course not. That would be terrible.\" Tuner waved goodbye. Jack waved back. \"Good luck, buddy,\" he said. Jack watched Tuner waddle back out into the baking sun. There was no point denying it – he was going to miss the little guy. His cup was almost empty. He finished what was left and went back to watching the view. Then he sighed. This was going to be a long six days. He looked over at where Tuner had pointed, towards the sheer face of a red and rocky outcrop, then back down at his empty metal cup. He stood up and tucked his chair in. Why not? It was something to do. * * * The walk to the mine took no more than a couple of minutes. The main street petered out into a thinner dust trail, flanked to either side by the same dense, tropical foliage that threatened to swallow the rest of the small settlement. Jack reached the end of the trail and brushed aside a couple of overgrown leaves. The entrance was carved into the bottom of a dusty red cliff face. A couple of Drygg guards sat on old crates to the right of it, playing some sort of card game. They barely looked up at Jack as he approached. \"Er… mind if I take a look around?\" The two guards looked at one another, then shrugged. \"Knock yourself out,\" said one of them, dealing a fresh hand. Jack continued onwards. See? The Dryggs seemed nice enough. Too friendly if anything. Tuner didn't know what he was talking about. He followed a long slope down into the depths of the mine. Metal girders and protective nets lined the interior, though the cut of the rock was so smooth and precise that Jack couldn't imagine anything ever falling loose. An endless wire looped along the ceiling – every few metres or so, a dim light shone from it like a firefly. Jack had expected the tunnel to be cooler than the rainforest outside. Yet the further he walked into the mine, the hotter the air seemed to get. It was like walking into an oven. Hell, it was like walking into a planet’s core. Sweat trickled down the back of his neck. His tongue turned to sandpaper. Blood pounded in his temples. He was seconds away from turning back when he caught sight of the tunnel's end. He staggered on, clutching at the nets on the walls for support until he reached the bottom. Huh. No wonder he felt so hot. An enormous cavern lay before him. Huge stalactites grew out from the ceiling and dripped into pits of lava bubbling in the rocky floor below. The air swam and danced in a thick haze. Automata were everywhere. Some drilled into the walls and cracked the rocks free. Others took those rocks and chiseled the iridium out of them. A third set carried trolleys of the precious element across treacherous natural bridges to conveyor belts on the other end of the cavern. The Dryggs stood beside each station and watched. Jack finally realised what their bulky white armour was for. Aside from preventing their exoskeletons from getting scratched by falling debris, their light, reflective colour made them stand out like safety vests in the dark cavern. Jack could understand why someone would choose to make automata do the work in such an inhospitable environment. He presumed the appropriate model for the job didn't feel the heat the same way a \"fleshy\" might. Using automata as a source of cheap labour was undeniably unfair, but, at the end of the day, it amounted to a job – no different from any other. It didn't seem half as bad as Tuner had made out. An automata pushing a trolley of iridium across the cavern slipped on a spot of wet rock. Its precious cargo went tumbling into the lava. A furious Drygg marched over and threw the poor, protesting robot in after it. Ah. Jack raised a hand to his open mouth. Scratch that. It was worse. He turned around and began the slow climb back up the slope. Behind him, the Dryggs dragged a replacement automata out from storage. Okay. He got it now. He got it. The population of the galaxy didn't view the automata as second-class citizens, or even as slaves, because the galaxy didn't view them as people at all. An automata was a product, no different from a data pad, or a self-driving car, or a glorified toaster. If it didn't work, you threw it away and got a new one. No wonder the crew of the Adeona were desperate to find that Detri place… even if it was just a fairy tale. If the whole universe saw him as disposable, he'd probably feel the same. His eyes stung from the sweat and heat. He rubbed them with his knuckles and blinked heavily. A small rectangle of daylight peered down at him from the top of the slope. He pressed on, panting and wheezing. The air grew cooler as he climbed, but the suspicion that he was on the verge of passing out remained. Well, the best of luck to the Adeona and her crew. It was probably a good thing they were going their separate ways. It wasn't as if he could do anything to help. He wasn't in a position to help any of them, really. He felt bad, but he had his own battles to fight. Like getting back to the bar, for starters.",

      "title": "Ode Vadasz, Bounty Hunter",
      "content": "12 Ode Vadasz, Bounty Hunter Ode Vadasz set the Black Arrow down on a dusty, rocky steppe not far from the small mining settlement. He hopped out of the cockpit and kicked an inquisitive rodent away from his ship. Standing at the edge of the steppe, he shielded his eyes with a leather-gloved hand. Haldeir-B. Hot, sticky and with a gravitational pull just shy of comfortable, Ode could have named half a dozen moons around the planet better suited for an emergency pit stop. But he supposed it could have been worse. Smaller populations meant fewer witnesses. He knelt down and pulled a pair of binoculars out from within the depths of his cloak. Where were they? After some focussing and adjusting, he spotted the Adeona's hull poking out above the tree line a few clicks west. He made a mental note of the rooftops between the ship and what looked like a rudimentary mine. A Drygg guard patrolled a landing pad on top of the red cliff above. Ode reckoned she was too far away to be a problem. A good start, but he needed a better view. He walked back to the ship and yanked open a compartment. Inside was a small, black puck not dissimilar to the disrupter mine he'd fired before. This one, however, had an antenna built into the top of its head, which Ode promptly extended. The puck rose into the air, spinning and beeping. It stopped a few feet above his head before extending a pair of tiny stabiliser wings. Then it waited. Ode smirked to himself. The old automata were the best. They didn't think unless they were told to. He double tapped a panel strapped to his left forearm. A holographic video screen leapt out. It was a camera feed from the drone – he could see himself in its picture. He entered a few co-ordinates into the panel, and the drone jetted off over the treetops. It arrived at the Adeona eleven seconds later. It hung back, dropped between the branches of the dense tree canopies where it wouldn't be seen, and watched. The disrupter mine still clutched the ship's backside like a barnacle. A small, gangly automata clambered over the hull and tried to pry it free with a makeshift crowbar. After a lot of straining, the mine remained where it was and the robot got catapulted off the landing pad. Ode sighed. This wouldn't be difficult. He piloted the drone over the top of the dock and down the street. It was a town of store clerks and off-shift miners, and otherwise as empty as he'd hoped. With any luck, he'd be in and out of that dump before any of the locals figured out what was happening. Not that it mattered if they did, of course. He just preferred to keep things clean. Ode was about to return the drone to the ship when he caught sight of something out of place. He guided it further down the street and zoomed in on the anomaly. A strange man in a cumbersome spacesuit emerged from a path hidden amongst the dense foliage and staggered towards the only bar in town. He appeared to be sweating profusely. Ode squinted at the shimmering hologram. He recognised the man stumbling down the street – not to mention a couple of the automata tending to the ship – from all the commotion back on Kapamentis. The spaceport had been busy, but in his line of work it paid to have an eye for detail. He lit a fresh cigarette and took a long drag. His client hadn't mentioned anyone besides the bolt-buckets. They were the bounty, not the man. Still. Any and all threats had to be dealt with, one way or another. He took control of the drone again. Nobody noticed it pass over the roof of the general store any more than they did the great birds that glided silently across the alien sky. Nor did anyone see it descend into one of the settlement's dark and narrow alleys. There it hovered, waiting on standby. Ode double tapped the panel on his forearm and the hologram vanished. He took another drag on his cigarette. Boy, was this a strange gig. Ten thousand credits was a lot of money. Not a fortune, but certainly far more than a ramshackle crew of obsolete automata was worth. There had to be something else – the true bounty – stashed away on that ship. He inspected the twin revolvers on his belt, admiring the way the sun danced across their silver barrels. Then he flicked his cigarette off the edge of the steppe. He would set off a beacon once he had the ship and its crew in his possession, as was expected. Ode grinned. It would be a terrible shame if any precious cargo went missing before his client got there.",

      "title": "Showdown on Haldeir-B",
      "content": "13 Showdown on Haldeir-B Jack nursed his third complimentary cup of water, having downed the second immediately upon returning to the Drygg bar. Each tasted even better than the last. The longer he sat there by the counter, the less severe his headache became. He hoped it wasn't heatstroke. He doubted there was a decent hospital for lightyears. His skin felt all sticky. His hair clung to his forehead. And he was pretty sure his sweat had formed into pools inside the legs of his spacesuit. He hadn't spoken to anyone since he got back from the mine – not the bartender (aside from to ask for more water), nor the Drygg couple still sitting and drinking together. After what he'd seen going on down there, he didn't particularly feel like making conversation. Neither had any more automata come to say goodbye. A quick glance over in the direction of the Adeona told Jack they were no closer to leaving the moon than he was. On the contrary – if her wild gesticulations were anything to go by, Rogan was more frustrated than ever. He felt like he should go help… but what on earth did he know about disrupter mines and skip drives? Besides, they'd made it perfectly clear they didn't want him getting in the way. Thirty-seven different bottles of brightly coloured liquid stood in a line on the shelf behind the bar. He knew because he'd counted them all. Twice. He tapped his fingers against the counter and started to count them again. The bar could have done with some music. Once this headache cleared, he was going to get really bored. Something hard and blunt jabbed into his side. Jack looked down. The blood ran out of his face. A gun was digging into the soft, elasticated material that sealed the two plastic halves of his spacesuit together. A very fancy gun, for that matter. It resembled an old revolver, complete with rotating chamber and hammer. Although its colour was a dark sort of silver, it was carved with blue alien runes and made from a material Jack had never seen before. A gloved hand held the gun. It looked… normal. Jack raised his head to look his potential assailant in the eye. Much to his surprise, the man had two of them. They were the usual size and shape, with striking blue irises. His jaw was chiseled and lined with tired stubble. He had ears. Normal ears. He was so familiar and ordinary, Jack almost had a heart attack. \"Are you a human?\" he whispered, for a moment forgetting about the gun pointed under his ribs. \"From, you know, Earth?\" \"Never heard of it,\" said Ode, speaking out the corner of a sneer. His breath smelled of old tobacco. \"Don't speak unless I tell you. And don't lie either, unless dripping from the walls is your idea of a good time.\" Jack tried to swallow but his throat was too dry. He turned to face the bar and nodded quickly. \"Good,\" said Ode. The Drygg bartender wandered over, paying neither of them much attention. \"Hey there,\" he said, polishing another metal cup. \"What can I do—\" \"Best if you leave us alone for a few minutes,\" said Ode, making no effort to conceal the threat in his voice. The bartender looked first at the bounty hunter, then down at his gun, and then hurried back to the other end of the bar. \"What's your business with that flying scrapyard outside?\" said Ode. \"The Adeona? No business. No business at all.\" Ode thumbed back the hammer of his gun. \"What did I tell you about lying?\" \"I'm not lying, I swear!\" Jack felt himself start to sweat again. \"I'm not with them – not anymore. I don't even know them really. I was adrift in space and they picked me up, that's all. They let me hitchhike as far as Kapamentis but somehow, in all the chaos and the shooting, I ended up back on their ship. I'm starting to wish I hadn't. Seriously – whatever trouble they're in, I've got nothing to do with it.\" \"Then why are you still here?\" \"I don't have a ship.\" Jack shrugged in as passive a way as possible. \"Believe me, I'd be long gone if I did.\" Ode studied him for a few tense seconds and then relaxed his gun. \"Okay. Keep talking. What have those bolt-buckets got on their ship that's worth so much?\" Jack's brow furrowed. \"On the ship? Nothing that I saw. Then again, I wouldn't notice something valuable round here even if it were shoved up my nose.\" \"There must be something,\" said Ode, rubbing his thumb across the runes on his revolver. \"Nobody pays ten thousand credits for a bunch of old automata.\" Jack's blood turned cold. Of course. Gaskan Troi had sent the bounty hunter after the rogue automata… but the hired gun didn't know that the real target was the folder of stolen blueprints stashed in Tuner's hard drive. He quickly shook his head. \"Nope, nothing springs to mind. But like I said, I'm not really the best person to ask.\" \"Well, it won't take long to find out. Those bots will talk quick enough if they know what's good for them.\" He slipped his gun back into a holster on his hip. \"Speaking of which… don't try anything stupid. Nobody's after you, and I'd rather not waste the ammo.\" Jack's stomach shrivelled up like a rotten apple. \"What are you going to do?\" he asked, slowly turning around on his stool as the bounty hunter went to leave. \"Don't you worry about that.\" Ode's black boots clomped against the dusty floor. \"You've got nothing to do with it, remember?\" \"Wait.\" Ode paused. His hand hovered inches from his hip. The Drygg couple, who'd been sitting at their table watching everything unfold in terrified silence, shrank into their chairs. \"I don't suppose there's any chance you could take me off this rock when you leave, is there?\" Ode let out a single dry laugh. He reached into a pocket inside his cloak and then flicked a silver coin in Jack's direction. Jack caught it. \"I'm nobody's chauffeur,\" he replied. \"But here – buy yourself a proper drink.\" With that, the bounty hunter marched out of the bar. Everybody breathed a collective sigh of relief. Jack opened his hand. The coin was old and chipped around the edge. It carried a faint insignia – an official-looking emblem of planets and stars. He didn't know if it was worth one credit or a hundred. Or what the exchange rate was, for that matter. He put it down on the counter and stared at it. Or rather, he stared through it. He felt like throwing up. The automata had no clue what they were up against. They had no defences, no plan, no way out. They couldn't stand up to a strong breeze, let alone an experienced bounty hunter. He thought about Rogan and Tuner being delivered into the skeletal hands of that creep Gaskan, and his heart sank. The thought of them being broken down for parts made it plummet further still. But there was nothing he could do. He continued to stare at the coin. There was nothing he could do. It wasn't his fight. It wasn't his problem. And he was just a cruddy engineer much too far from home. So why did he get the feeling he was about to do something incredibly stupid? * * * Ode Vadasz marched down the dirt street, the glare of the sun warming the cloak on his back. The automata still busied themselves around the rear of their ship, more desperate and flustered than ever. He shook his head. Idiots. Nobody paid him any notice as he climbed the short set of steps up to the landing pad. He pulled one of his revolvers out from its holster, raised it into the air, and fired. The resulting boom silenced the whole settlement. All of the automata froze in their tasks. Feathered birds and winged reptiles took flight from the treetop canopies. Now he had their attention. He tapped at the panel on his forearm. The drone he hid earlier rose up from the secluded alley beside the general store. It drifted over everyone's heads and settled a couple feet above the hull of the Adeona. \"Thank you for your attention,\" said Ode, nodding at the stunned robots. \"If you'd—\" The dock administrator with whom 11-P-53 had been having a heated discussion came sprinting around from the front of the ship, a plasma rifle clutched in his hands. Ode spun round and fired a single shot. It hit the Drygg right between the eyes, fracturing its horn. The alien's lifeless body rolled off the landing pad into the dirt below. Ode turned back to the automata. \"Sorry about that,\" he said in a voice completely devoid of remorse. \"As I was saying. I have been commissioned to apprehend the crew of this ship\"—he gestured to the Adeona—\"and keep you detained until my client gets here. No, I do not know his name. No, I do not know your names. And no, I don't care why this is happening to you. Arrange yourselves into an orderly line.\" The automata remained frozen to the spot. Ode sighed and raised his revolver again. \"How difficult do you want to make this? Now.\" Everybody shuffled forward. There were sixteen or seventeen of them in total, from stocky, retro cuboids, to skinny models like 11-P-53, to little Kansas down at the far end. They waited obediently. There wasn't much else they could do. Tuner reached up and squeezed Rogan's hand. \"Good work.\" Ode tapped away at his arm-panel again. \"If you all do as you're told, there's no reason anyone needs to be hurt.\" The drone above the Adeona dropped down and latched itself onto the ship's hull. A tiny red light on the tip of its antenna began to blink. The beacon was active. He tapped another combination of keys. Rogan watched in disbelief as the disrupter mine they'd spent so long trying to dislodge disengaged itself from the ship's thrusters and rocketed back into the bounty hunter's hand. \"I'll take that,\" said Ode, hooking it onto his belt. \"What's Gaskan paying you?\" said a nervous 11-P-53. \"We can beat it.\" \"We'll see about that,\" said Ode, winking at the robot. \"Any more of you inside that ship?\" 11-P-53 looked each way down the line of automata, then shook its head. \"I think this is all of us.\" \"For your sake, I hope you're telling me the truth. We've still got a while before this 'Gaskan' of yours gets here. I'd hate to have to kill anything other than time.\" He paused as if he'd heard something nobody else could. Then he sighed. \"Speaking of which…\" The proprietor of the general store came barging out through its door. He was older than the other Dryggs in the settlement. His carapace was bleached and scarred. Judging by the ancient rifle in his hands, he hadn't come out to sell Ode a souvenir. \"Head on back inside, old man,\" said Ode, sneering. \"Before you—\" The old beetle was quicker than he looked. He fired off a round from his rifle. Unfortunately, his aim wasn't quite as spritely as his reflexes. It missed Ode by a good foot and a half, passed over a surprised automata's head and burned a hole through a giant fern on the other side. Ode didn't make that sort of mistake. He fired twice, just to be certain. The first round hit the armour on the Drygg's chest, burning a slow hole through the top layer but nothing more. The second was a headshot. It lifted the old man off the ground and carried him halfway down the street. He landed with a heavy thud. His rifle skidded through the dust and dirt. \"Shame,\" muttered Ode, growing impatient. He spun around and aimed his smoking handgun at the box-shaped automata in the middle of the line. \"What's so valuable on your ship?\" he snapped. \"What are you hiding?\" The cuboid shrank away from the gun. \"Nothing,\" it whimpered. \"We're—\" Ode fired. A shrapnel cloud of computer chips exploded out the back of the robot's torso. The other automata screamed and clutched one another. The cuboid crashed to the ground and shut down. \"Let's hope he wasn't important,\" said Ode, continuing down the line. He stopped at 11-P-53 and levelled his revolver at its head. \"Ten thousand credits. What have you got worth that much?\" * * * Jack watched these events unfold from a crouched position behind the bar's most front-facing wall. He hadn't even left the shade of the awning before the bounty hunter fired off his first shot, killing the Drygg administrator. Then the store owner had come out… and now there were two dead Dryggs. Everything had gotten way out of hand. He glanced over his shoulder. The alien couple who'd been drinking together were hiding behind an upturned metal table. The bartender was nowhere to be seen. Jack realised that he was instinctively looking around for a telephone with which to call the authorities. He didn't even know if there were authorities on Haldeir-B, or anywhere else in the star system, or the whole damn galaxy for that matter. If there were, he suspected they were the ones already lying dead in the street. The best he could do was stay quiet and hope everyone forgot about him. He suspected they already had. And yet… And yet with each passing second, he felt more sick. More responsible, somehow. As if he had personally put a price on the automata's heads, or pointed the bounty hunter in their direction, or done something for which he could possibly be blamed. But he hadn't done anything, except make it abundantly clear that he and the crew of the Adeona were not affiliated in any way. Which was true. In fact, it was more than true – it was what the automata wanted. But he hadn't done anything. Those words wouldn't budge from Jack's mind. Now he was angry as well as scared. What the hell was he supposed to do? Yet another gunshot rang out. Jack jerked his head out of cover just in time to witness one of the robots on the landing pad topple over, dead, a visceral hole blown right through its middle. His heart threatened to beat right out of his chest. Bile crept up his throat. He dropped back into cover, covered his head with his hands, and started to rock back and forth. This was bad. This was so bad. He had to do something. He peered around the wall again. The bounty hunter walked down the line of automata and paused beside 11-P-53. Jack felt his guts twist. As much as he disliked the little twerp, he didn't want to see 11-P-53 blown into a million tiny pieces. He had to do something. Think! The dead Drygg was slumped against the porch of his general store. But his rifle lay in the middle of the deserted street. Nobody was even looking at it. Oh, no. That was a terrible idea. He'd fired all manner of guns before – it had formed part of his pilot training. From the look of the alien rifle, it followed the same general principles. Pull the trigger, something deadly comes out. How difficult could it really be? Jack watched as the bounty hunter pointed his revolver at 11-P-53's head. He was right. It was a terrible idea. And he was going to do it anyway. Jack sprinted out from under the cover of the awning, his head down and his eyes almost closed. His whole body was tense. He expected to be shot and killed at any moment. He wasn't. He snatched up the rifle, almost crashing through the dirt as he did so, and fumbled with it as he tried to get it pointing in the right direction. When he did, he found Ode staring back at him. \"Are you sure you want to do that?\" asked Ode, gritting his teeth. \"Get your hands up where I can see them!\" said Jack, his voice breaking. \"Let the automata go, or I'll shoot. I mean it!\" Ode grinned and raised his hands as if surrendering. The revolver dangled loose from one of his fingers. Then he twisted the buckles that held his cloak around his neck. The cloak spilled to the ground and Ode lowered his arms again. All four of them. \"Not a human, then,\" said Jack, mostly to himself. \"Not a human,\" confirmed Ode. His three empty hands each plucked a revolver from the holsters on his hips. \"You should have bought yourself that drink, you know.\" \"Yeah, probably.\" His hands were shaking. \"Now scram, before things get any worse.\" Ode walked down the steps of the landing pad, laughing and shaking his head. \"You know, you've made this day much more interesting than it needed to be.\" He came to a stop at the foot of the street. \"How about we make this a fair fight? Shoot on the count of three?\" Jack wasn't sure how that swung the odds of survival in his favour exactly, but whatever. He already figured his chances were zero either way. \"Sure,\" he said, swallowing hard. \"Good. Three.\" Ode fired a single shot. Jack flew backwards and landed face-down in the dirt. * * * Ode holstered all but one of his revolvers. \"Idiot,\" he said, shaking his head. He started to walk towards the body, then paused. He spun around and glared at the automata. \"Anyone who moves gets turned into copper confetti,\" he said. The automata continued to whimper and clutch at one another. Tuner hung his head low. Rogan squeezed his hand all the tighter. Ode continued slowly down the street. The sound of dirt crunching under his boots rang out loud amongst the silence of the settlement. It hadn't been a headshot. He needed to confirm the kill. He approached Jack's body. It wasn't moving. He gave it a kick. Jack rolled onto his back. His eyes were shut. He didn't appear to be breathing. A small, cindering hole had burned through his spacesuit, just above his heart. Still. It didn't hurt to be careful. Ode thumbed back the hammer on his revolver. A deafening roar caught him by surprise. He spun around to see the Adeona's thrusters erupt in twin jets of blue flame. The automata remained lined up where he'd left them. Alarmed, one of his hands darted to the disrupter mine hanging from his belt. \"You said there weren't any more crew members aboard the ship,\" he yelled, pointing the gun at 11-P-53 instead. 11-P-53 raised its hands in the air. \"There aren't,\" it replied. \"The ship is a crew member.\" \"Tell her to stay put!\" \"Oh, she's not going anywhere.\" 11-P-53 ducked down. \"She's just trying to distract you.\" Ode's face fell. He spun back around, gun drawn. It was too late. A plasma bolt ploughed through the centre of his chest, leaving behind a smoking hole the size of a tennis ball. Ode blinked twice then fell to the dirt, dead. * * * Jack dropped the plasma rifle and clawed at the hole in his spacesuit. Whatever he'd been shot with had burned through to his skin. He let out an agonising groan. The automata broke from their line the moment the bounty hunter fell. Some fled to the relative safety of the Adeona's loading ramp. Others ran to where Jack lay. \"That was amazing,\" said Tuner, the first to arrive by his side. \"How did you know he wouldn't shoot you in the head?\" \"I didn’t.\" Jack gritted his teeth and screamed. \"God, I'm starting to wish he had.\" \"He used a corrosive round,\" said Rogan, peering into the jagged, smoking hole. \"We need to get the suit off him and treat the wound before it goes any deeper.\" Jack let out another groan. \"Well, we can't hang around here much longer,\" said 11-P-53. Dryggs were emerging from the buildings all around. They didn't look pleased. \"Get him on the ship, quickly.\" Rogan, Tuner and a chunky robot Jack didn't recognise lifted him off the ground and carried him towards the Adeona. Being carried hurt even more than lying on the ground. It felt as if somebody was putting out a cigarette on his body… only instead of having its embers extinguished, the cigarette was tunnelling through his skin. By the time they reached the top of the loading ramp, the pain had grown intolerable. Sweat poured off him in thin tributaries. Screw the cigarette analogy – somebody had tossed him in a bloody furnace. The Adeona lurched off the landing pad, leaving a bitter moon behind.",

      "title": "Surgery",
      "content": "14 Surgery They carried him into his quarters and dropped him on the bunk. Jack winced and sucked in air through his gritted teeth. \"We have to get this thing off him,\" said Rogan, detaching the spacesuit's right arm. \"Hurry!\" Another automata twisted the left arm off, and then Rogan pulled the entire top half of Jack’s spacesuit over his head. Unfortunately, this involved sitting up. Yet another dose of screaming followed. \"Take the suit to the loading bay,\" said Rogan, handing the chest plate to Tuner. \"See what you can do with it.\" Under his suit Jack wore a thin white undershirt – one half of the thermal set he'd changed into before being fitted into the spacesuit. The cotton was charred and black where the bounty hunter's round had burned through. Jack brought his head as far forward as he could. The skin just above his heart was all wrinkled and raw. Blood pulsed out from a deep, open wound. Rogan pushed his head back down before he could start to panic. The same automata who had detached the left arm of his suit now extended a small, pen-shaped laser from its rotund chest. It cut Jack’s undershirt down the middle. Rogan pulled the two halves apart without hesitation. \"Tweezers, now,\" she snapped. Somebody handed her a pair. Another automata extended a long, mechanical arm above the bunk, from which a bright light shone. Jack’s vision started to blur. The pain grew too great. He felt his grip on consciousness begin to slip away. And then Rogan stuck the tweezers in. \"What the hell are you doing?\" he managed to say between tearful cries. \"Pulling the round out.\" Rogan pushed him back down. Two more automata pinned Jack's arms to the bed. \"It'll keep eating away at your flesh unless I remove it.\" The tweezers went back inside. Jack screamed again. It was clear Rogan didn't understand human anatomy all too well. It felt as if she was pinching the arteries of his heart… and not in a poetic, romantic sort of way. \"Got it,\" she said, raising the tweezers triumphantly. Even Jack lifted his head to take a look. The projectile looked like a shotgun slug, only much smaller. A noxious green substance oozed out from holes along its serrated edge. \"Get it off the ship,\" she said, handing the offending item to somebody else. She brought her face closer to Jack's and smiled. \"You're going to be fine, but we have to clean the wound up. This may sting a bit.\" \"Painkillers, please.\" He swatted listlessly at her shoulder. \"Or alcohol. Lots of alcohol.\" She nodded at an automata he couldn’t see. It hurriedly rolled out of the room in the direction of the pantry. \"We'll see what we have.\" Rogan picked up a long hose with a tall, metal canister at one end and a suction cup at the other. \"Half the booze in this galaxy would be worse for you than the bullet.\" \"Not right now they wouldn't. What is that?\" \"This? This is what we're going to clean the wound with. There's still acid to suck out. It's normally used for unblocking the intake manifolds, but don't worry. It's sanitary.\" \"I'm going to die,\" Jack groaned. \"Probably not,\" replied Rogan, switching it on. The pain was indescribable. A cold, grey cloud enveloped him, and then he passed out. * * * When Jack woke again, he did so from a cold and dreamless sleep. The pain had knocked him out – he suspected it was the throbbing ache that had brought him back around again. He gritted his teeth and propped himself up on his elbows. This did not help alleviate the discomfort. A bolt of hot pain shot through his shoulder and across his chest. He collapsed back onto the mattress with a yelp. Scared of what he might see, Jack peered down at the spot where he'd been shot. He let out a whimper. A two-inch scar ran lengthways across his bare chest, only a hair's breadth above his heart. It was thick, pink and a little gnarly – as if the wound had been cauterised rather than sewn shut. There were patches that looked unnervingly smooth and raw. He prodded the scar with his finger and immediately wished he hadn’t. Yet despite the searing pain, he felt an almost hysterical sense of relief. He was still alive. He'd stood up against an intergalactic bounty hunter, and somehow he was still alive! A short-lived smile flashed across his face before he remembered he was still a few trillion miles from home… and had probably just added his name to a homicidal warlord's naughty book. He rolled over as much as his protesting scar would allow and stared out the window of his quarters. There were no planets, no stars, no crimson nebulas. Only a flat and absolute darkness punctuated by the pulsing of midnight blue waves. The Adeona was on the move through subspace. The question was: where was she headed? Jack jumped as the chair beside the window spun around. A pair of glowing yellow eyes bloomed in the darkness. \"Oh good,\" said Tuner. \"You're awake.\" \"Apparently so,\" said Jack, taking great effort to sit up. \"How long was I out for?\" \"A few hours. You passed out during the cleaning. I wanted to wake you up but Rogan told me not to. She said it meant you wouldn't feel the rest of the procedure.\" \"How on earth did she get it to heal so quick?\" Jack caught himself before he could give the scar another prod. \"I would have thought there'd be stitches at least.\" \"Ah, Rogan is plenty used to putting fleshies back together. Her old owner was always getting himself into accidents.\" He pointed at the scar. \"It may not be pretty but, erm, the prognosis is good.\" \"Well, it sure beats having a bullet burn through my chest cavity.\" Jack shivered and crossed his arms, despite the ache. \"I guess I need to find a new shirt.\" Tuner bleeped and hopped off the chair. He hurried over to the other end of the bunk and picked something up. \"That cloth thing you had on was covered in blood, so we threw it out the airlock. But a couple of us had a go at fixing your spacesuit.\" He handed the torso of Jack's spacesuit over. Most of it looked exactly the same, plus or minus a few extra scratches. But the section of thick plastic through which the slug had burned a hole was patched up with two square pieces of scrap metal hastily soldered together. \"I know it doesn't look great, but it should keep the air in if you find yourself floating out in space again,\" said Tuner, sheepishly. \"Though I suppose without a helmet you won’t notice much of a difference.\" Jack slipped the suit over his head and smiled. \"It's wonderful. Thank you.\" Then his smile vanished. \"What happened to the photograph in the pocket?\" He patted and pried at where the compartment on the chest plate had been. \"Where did you put it?\" Tuner bowed his head and held out a scrap of paper. \"There was nothing we could do,\" he said. Jack took the photograph and, as delicately as he could with trembling fingers, unfolded it. What was left of it, at least. \"No no no,\" he groaned, turning it over and over. The corrosive slug had passed through the photograph on its way to his flesh. Amber's smiling face had been completely burned from the picture, as had most of Jack. Plenty of the stunning coastline remained, but beyond that the photograph was nothing but a black, curling crisp. \"I'm sorry,\" said Tuner. \"How is this happening?\" asked Jack, raising his voice. \"Seriously – how is this happening to me?\" \"Don't worry,\" said Tuner. \"You'll get back to Earth and—\" \"No I won't!\" Jack's voice broke as it grew even louder. \"I have no idea where the hell I am, or where I'm going! And if you guys won't help me find Earth, why in this godforsaken galaxy will anyone else?\" He waved the burned photograph in Tuner's face. \"This is all I have of her, do you understand?\" Tears rolled down his face, though he wouldn't realise he was crying until afterwards. \"If I don't get back home, then this is all I have. And now it's gone.\" He laid back down on the bunk and covered his face with his hands. \"I never should have agreed to that damn experiment,” he said. \"And I never should have got myself mixed up in everyone else's mess.\" Tuner bowed his head again. \"Jack…\" \"Go away, Tuner.\" He didn’t remove his hands from his face. \"Please. I just want to be left alone.\" Tuner watched Jack lie there for a moment longer, and then slunk off towards the door. * * * The door opened again a few minutes later. \"I told you before, Tuner,\" said Jack, sitting up. \"I'm not in the mood to see anyone right now.\" He craned his neck, but he couldn't see anybody standing in the doorway. When the door hissed shut again, he relaxed. Then he heard the sound of miniature tank treads rolling across the metal floor. He peered over the side of the bunk and saw Kansas approach the small dresser to the right of him. It was carrying a small metal bowl. \"Erm, hello?\" Kansas came to a stop. It lifted the bowl up onto the top of the dresser using a pair of thin, retractable arms extended from within its cylindrical body. \"In case you're hungry,\" it said in a small, timid voice. A circle of lights flashed around the top of its head. \"Hopefully you like it better than the stuff you ate from that tin.\" \"Oh. Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" He watched as Kansas trundled back out of the room. The door opened and shut behind it. With immense suspicion, he turned his head towards the bowl. He counted nine golden-orange cubes inside. They were perfectly diced, as if prepared by somebody who believes that sustenance ought to follow a strict mathematical formula. They also looked incredibly juicy. His stomach growled just looking at them. Ah, what the hell. He'd survived being shot by a bounty hunter. He couldn't back down from a bit of fruit. He picked up a cube and gently squeezed it. It had a light, spongey texture. He gave it a quick sniff. It smelled citrusy. He popped it into his mouth. For the first half a second, Jack wasn't sure what to make of it. After that, he was certain it was one of the best things he'd ever tasted in his life. It was as if somebody had married together the genes of a mango, a passionfruit, a clementine and – bizarrely – an angel cake, resulting in a beautiful Frankenstein fruit that dissolved like sherbet upon his tongue. He devoured all nine cubes in less than a minute and, much to his surprise, found his hunger immediately quenched. Not long after that, he noticed the pain in his chest had grown a little less intense, too. He wondered if the fruit carried medicinal qualities as well as a perfect flavour. His hysterical urge to trash his quarters had certainly diminished since eating it. There was no point in getting upset or angry. Neither would he get any closer to re-discovering Earth by lying on his bunk feeling sorry for himself. Losing the photograph may have been heartbreaking, but it changed nothing. It certainly didn't make getting back home any less urgent. That said, he’d been indebted to the automata ever since they saved his life. They needed his help if they were to ever make it to Detri. He'd saved them on Haldeir-B, and now their fates were tied… whether Jack liked it or not. It was simple, really. The best way to get back home was to help the automata find a new one.",

      "title": "The Ceros Gate",
      "content": "15 The Ceros Gate The second time Jack woke up in his quarters – having deliberately fallen asleep this time, and having suffered no nightmares of despotic suns – the stars were back outside his window. The Adeona had exited subspace. He sat up on his bunk and marvelled at how much better his chest felt already. A dull ache still lingered, but he could hardly believe he'd been shot only a few hours before. If it weren't for the nasty scar above his heart, he may well have chalked it all up as another bad dream. The arms of his spacesuit had been left propped up against the dresser following his operation. Jack pulled them over each arm and twisted them into position. He felt like he was wearing the spacefaring equivalent of a tank top without them. He stood up, picked up the empty bowl, and carried it out to the pantry. When he found the pantry deserted, he headed for the cockpit instead. All of the automata were crowded around the consoles and hologram table, bickering over what to do. A number of them looked up as Jack entered. 11-P-53 gave him a respectful nod. \"Feeling better?\" asked Rogan, giving him a dry, amused smile. \"Much.\" Jack leaned against one of the terminals. \"What was in that fruit?\" \"You mean the kwagua berry,\" she replied, nodding. \"It's native to the Kw'ek system. The locals grow them for their hallucinogenic qualities, but for most other species, they make for a great painkiller.\" Tuner peeked out from behind the other side of the hologram table. \"How you doing, buddy?\" Jack raised his hand. Tuner enthusiastically waved back. \"So, what's the holdup?\" asked Jack. \"We've stopped, haven't we?\" \"No holdup.\" 11-P-53 pointed out the cockpit's windows. \"We're here.\" Before the Adeona lay a new star system, one more claustrophobic than Jack ever thought possible. All the planets were within visible distance of one another, orbiting a pale blue sun that could have been no bigger than Jupiter. In the middle of it all, half in black silhouette and half cast in shimmering silver-blue by the geriatric sun, was an enormous space station shaped like a stretched-out spinning top. Scores of tiny drones spread out from the station in every direction and at seemingly infinite length, linking together to form a faint, flickering, golden forcefield. \"Here?\" asked Jack, turning back to the automata. \"Where's here?\" \"The Ceros system.\" Tuner pointed at the forcefield. \"And that golden monstrosity is the Ceros Gate.\" \"Why in God's name is everything behind it so… cramped?\" \"It didn't use to be.\" Rogan brought up a flickering blue diagram of a more regular-looking solar system on her hologram table. \"Not until the Negoti Corporation bought it a couple decades back. The system has no species of advanced intelligence, but the planets themselves are unusually rich with minerals – Somnium crystals in particular. But the planets were also very far apart from one another, and the levels of fuel required to bring the unrefined ore to the central processing facility would have dug deep into the company's profits. So the Negoti Corporation cut costs by bringing them all closer together.\" \"What? How?\" \"By dropping artificial gravity wells around the star,\" continued Rogan. The holographic diagram changed to illustrate the trajectory for each of the eleven planets, all spiralling inward towards the centre of the solar system. \"It took about a year for the planets to get as close to one another as they are today, by which point the wells had drained most of the sun's energy too. Which was good for Negoti, as a larger star might have devoured the very planets they were trying to mine.\" Jack looked back out at the planets and asteroids and swarms of spacecraft, all busying around the space station like particles around an atom's nucleus. He shook his head in disbelief. \"They can do that?\" Rogan smirked. \"You won't believe what people can do with a star these days,\" she said. Jack smiled in excitement. They could change the size of a sun – maybe they could fix a dying one, too. Then his expression of wonder transformed into one of concerned puzzlement. \"Wait, did you say Ceros? Isn't that the star system you said you needed clearance codes for?\" \"The one and the same,\" replied 11-P-53. \"Sorry, am I missing something?\" Jack shot a quick glance at Rogan. \"You don't have the codes… do you?\" She went to reply, but 11-P-53 got there first. \"No, we don't. But we don't have enough fuel to change course, either. If we're to reach Detri, we have to continue through Ceros as planned.\" 11-P-53 tilted its head as if daring Jack to argue. He didn't. \"Okay. So what is the plan?\" \"We were just ironing out the last few wrinkles when you joined us.\" 11-P-53 gestured for Tuner to step forward and explain. \"The Adeona is a mining vessel, right?\" said Tuner, wandering around from the other side of the hologram table. \"She might not be the same model of ship as the ones that the Negoti Corporation uses, but I reckon she can blend in amongst the crowd for a short while… providing I scramble Negoti's radar signal, that is. \"Every ship has to pass through the security checkpoint here.\" Tuner pointed at the space station in the centre of the gargantuan golden forcefield. \"Every ship except the cargo trains that carry ore and equipment from one side to the other. They can deactivate sections of the forcefield if they need to. If we're patient we can follow one of them through, bypass the Gate completely, and then skip off into subspace before anyone notices.\" He stood back from the table and looked proud of himself. \"Okay…\" Jack was determined to be as tactful as possible. \"That's not too bad a plan. But it sort of presumes a corporation powerful enough to shrink down an entire solar system has installed an access code system that fundamentally doesn't work. Maybe you can keep the ship hidden while we're still far out, but I bet we get swamped with code requests before we're within even a thousand clicks of that forcefield. And even if we do get through, you can be sure there'll be Negoti ships waiting for us on the other side.\" \"Jack's got a point,\" said Rogan. \"The Ceros Gate is there to make sure rogue mining vessels can't sneak in and steal Somnium crystals from the planets Negoti has paid for. If anything, being a non-approved mining vessel rather than a civilian ship might make us stand out even more.\" \"And maybe I'm wrong about this,\" said Jack, a little more cautiously, \"but doesn't the skip drive boot you out of subspace if you come too close to an object of large mass? Isn't that what you told me, Tuner?\" Tuner nodded, a little embarrassed. \"How would we jump to subspace then?\" Jack pointed at the cluster of planets outside the cockpit's windows. \"Look at that mess. There's barely a spot on the other side that isn't a large mass.\" \"Another good point,\" said Brackitt, spinning around in his chair up front. \"The only clear path into subspace is directly on the other side of that security checkpoint. If we sneak through anywhere else on the Gate, we'll still have to go around the planets before we can make the jump.\" 11-P-53 tapped its metal foot, clearly irritated. \"Like I said, there are still a few details we need to work through.\" Everyone fell silent, thinking. \"Are we safe, floating around out here?\" asked Jack, after a while. \"We're outside the range of their scanners,\" replied Brackitt, nodding. \"Since they shrunk the star system, we're not technically trespassing into its heliosphere. Yet.\" More silent thinking. \"What's this Negoti Corporation like?\" asked Jack, squinting out the windows. \"Any chance they might be sympathetic enough to turn a blind eye?\" 11-P-53 laughed. This time it was Rogan who answered. \"The Negoti Corporation is one of the most powerful and profitable companies in the whole galaxy,\" she replied. \"They're run by the Ghuk, for the most part. Nasty insect humanoids with limited emotional range. And they didn't get where they are today without being just as reliant on automata to pad out their workforce as everyone else.\" \"So that's a no, then?\" \"Unless everyone here wants to spend the rest of their life cracking rocks, that is indeed a no.\" \"So what do we do?\" asked Tuner. \"We can't wait here forever.\" \"We go ahead with the original plan,\" said 11-P-53, boldly marching over to the captain's chair. \"We'll be gone before they even know we're here.\" \"Wait.\" Jack darted to the hologram table. \"Rogan, can you bring up a map of the Ceros system as it looks right now?\" \"This is the most up-to-date one we have,\" she replied. The hologram changed to reflect the scene outside the windows. She enlarged the image with a sweep of her hand. \"It should be reasonably accurate. The planets don't have much of an orbit anymore.\" \"What are you looking for?\" asked Tuner. \"So we have to go through this system, right?\" said Jack, circling the table. \"The Gate is too wide to go around. Yet if we try our luck at the checkpoint, Negoti will either send us back or shoot us down. So what we need is a backdoor or shortcut of some kind – a route that's short enough for our limited fuel reserves, keeps us clear of their radars, and gives us a clean shot into subspace once we're on the other side. Come on, guys. There has to be something.\" Everyone studied the map without much luck. \"This is a waste of time.\" 11-P-53 crossed its arms. \"I don't see anything.\" \"How about through there?\" Tuner pointed at a planet not too far from the central station. Unlike the other planets lurking safely behind the Ceros gate, its decayed orbit had left it floating halfway through the forcefield. \"Aside from a few dozen patrol ships, it looks mostly unguarded. And there's not too much blocking our way out once we're on the other side, either. I know it's a bit close to the security checkpoint, but…\" Rogan zoomed in further. As the image grew more detailed, Jack began to suspect that it wasn't a planet at all, but rather a tight cluster of asteroids. Then, with a dawning sense of both awe and horror, he realised it was a planet – one cracked into hundreds of thousands of chunks, from rocks no greater than a car to a few the size of whole continents. \"What happened to it?\" asked Jack, appalled. \"Negoti blew it apart,\" said Rogan. \"It's the easiest way to get to the precious minerals near the core. There were thirteen planets before they bought the place.\" She spun the hologram around and shook her head. \"This won't work. That forcefield is super tight. It won't have left any gaps around the surface of the planet.\" \"No, not around the planet. Through it.\" Tuner shrugged innocently. \"Hey, you said you wanted to find the shortest route from here to the other side of the Gate. There won't be any forcefield on the inside.\" Everyone took a closer look at the chasms and cracks between floating chunks of dead planet. It was a dark and deadly labyrinth. \"You realise those pieces won't be stationary in real life, right?\" said Rogan. \"They'll be moving in and out, creating new passages and destroying others. Even while they're open, some of those gaps won't be much wider than the Adeona.\" \"She won't be able to plot a course for herself, either.\" Brackitt shook his head. \"Her nav systems are fried and the terrain is too unpredictable. Somebody would have to fly her through manually.\" \"No way.\" 11-P-53 shook its head. \"I can't do it. Besides, it's too reckless. I won't endanger my crew like that.\" \"I'll do it,\" said Jack, quietly. Everyone turned to look at him. \"I can do it,\" he said, a little louder despite his dry throat. \"I trained as a pilot before I became an engineer. Did hundreds of simulations, a few of which involved flying heavy supply ships through some pretty tight gullies.\" \"Simulations?\" asked 11-P-53. \"No actual flights?\" Jack shrugged. His face turned red. \"If I don't crash, what's the difference?\" \"What's the difference?\" 11-P-53 threw its arms in the air. \"What's the difference? You haven't even been in space before, let alone flown through it!\" \"She wants him to do it,\" said Brackitt. Jack and 11-P-53 stopped bickering and turned to face him. So did all the other automata. Brackitt cradled the cable running from his head to the ship's dashboard in his hand. \"Sorry, what?\" asked Jack. \"The Adeona – she says she wants you to fly her,\" said Brackitt, shrugging. \"She thinks you have what it takes.\" 11-P-53 went as if to protest, then thought better of it. \"Well it's her choice, I suppose,\" it said, shaking its head. \"Is everyone else okay with a fleshy taking control of the ship?\" One by one, all of the automata nodded or bleeped in the affirmative. \"Then she's all yours,\" said 11-P-53, disappointedly gesturing to the captain's chair. Jack took a deep breath to steady himself, suddenly aware that everyone's eyes (or lenses, or diodes) were boring into him. The expectant automata backed away from the hologram table, clearing a path to the front of the ship. Jack glanced over at Rogan as he walked down the steps. She gave him a subtle, reassuring nod. Tuner stood by her side, looking up at him with quiet, excited apprehension. He lowered himself into the captain's chair. The leather was thick and heavily cushioned. It was designed for a species slightly larger than a human, yet its soft padding settled to fit the contours of his body. He felt almost cradled within its curved, half-eggshell-shaped frame. It was surprisingly comfortable. \"Be careful with her,\" said Brackitt, leaning across. \"I think she has a crush on you.\" \"What, the ship?\" Brackitt shrugged. Even without a mouth, Jack could tell he was smirking. \"You're the one who called her wonderful, don’t forget.” Jack stared at the smorgasbord of buttons and levers littering the dashboard. He ran his hand along their surface. \"And she is,\" he replied. \"Simply wonderful.\" He clenched his hands into fists to keep them from shaking. This was it. This was everything he ever wanted. All his training at the Academy; all those late nights he spent pushing himself on the sims, desperate to come top of his class; all his dreams dashed when he went backpacking because he couldn't bring himself to fly. Yet here he was, sat behind the wheel of not a jet fighter but an actual spacecraft. Everything – everything – had been leading to this moment. Forget engineering. Forget qualifications. He was a pilot, had always been a pilot… and a damn good one, too. All he had to do now was keep his nerves from flaring up. He steadied himself, pushed one of the levers forward, and led the Adeona out into the Ceros star system.",

      "title": "Under the Radar",
      "content": "16 Under the Radar Jack took less than three minutes to get to grips with the basics of Adeona's controls. Her setup wasn't quite as intuitive as that of a fighter jet or even one of the United Earth Government's more hefty supply ships, but neither was it too complicated. A lever to his left regulated the strength and speed of her rear thrusters, while a joystick directly in front of him allowed for movement up, down, left and right. Paddles on the second lever activated the air brakes on each side of the ship, which swapped a strafing manoeuvre for a sharper, banked turn. Any kid who'd ever gone near a video game controller could have picked it up. But there were dozens of other buttons and flaps and switches which remained completely alien to him. He didn't even want to know which button activated the skip drive. As they drifted slowly in the direction of the cracked planet, an almighty clanging sound came from inside a panel beneath the ship's dashboard. Tuner poked his head out. \"We're a fair way inside Ceros' heliosphere now,\" he said, referring to the outer limits of the solar system, \"but so far I'm only picking up the faintest traces of Negoti's radar signal. I can scramble it for the time being, but it'll get a lot stronger once we're closer to the Gate.\" \"The Adeona says everything is good so far,\" said Brackitt, nodding like a doctor checking a patient's heartbeat through a stethoscope. \"You can go a bit quicker, if you like.\" Jack was going at the speed he felt most comfortable with, thank you very much. But he knew Tuner couldn't hold off Negoti's radar scans forever, so he gently pushed the left lever further forward. He shouldn't have been surprised when there was no sensation of increased velocity outside the cockpit's windows. The pressure on his chest grew for the most marginal of moments as they accelerated, but the stars remained as static as always, like tiny white flecks of paint on a black canvas. Of course they wouldn't appear any closer. This was nothing like flying across oceans or fields of corn. Most of the time, space couldn't offer a point of reference. Considering the distance from solar system to solar system, and the speeds at which a ship could travel, the stars on the horizon weren't really any closer at all. Unless you used a skip drive, of course. Everett Reeves really hadn't been joking when he said getting to the nearest star could take humanity dozens of lifetimes. No wonder he was so desperate to get the wormhole tech to work. And yet, even without jumping to subspace, the planets beyond the Ceros Gate were growing noticeably bigger as they approached. God only knew how fast the Adeona must have been going. Faster than any ship Earth had ever produced, that was for sure. \"At our present velocity, we should reach Ceros-VI within five minutes,\" said Rogan, monitoring the ship's course on the hologram table. \"Keep on the planet's starboard side as much as you can.\" Brackitt kept the left-hand windows of the Adeona magnified so that everyone could better monitor the Negoti space station, just in case it became alerted of their presence and sent out attack drones. As Jack pitched the Adeona to the right, he marvelled at the queue of supply ships waiting to pass through the checkpoint. \"Kill the engines,\" said Rogan. \"Now!\" Jack didn't even have to press anything – the Adeona did it herself. The levers and joysticks snapped back to their original positions and her thrusters shut down, killing the rumble that permeated through her hull. Even without propulsion, she continued to rocket forward through frictionless space. \"What happened?\" Jack spun the chair around. \"Did I do something wrong?\" 11-P-53 shook its head and marched down the steps to join him. \"Out there,\" it said, pointing out the window. \"Do you see that?\" Jack squinted, then magnified the screen, then increased the brightness. A small, stocky spacecraft was headed towards them. Large filament-bulb searchlights ran along its roof. It had what looked like rocket launchers attached to either side. \"It's a patrol ship.\" 11-P-53 dashed back to the hologram table. \"It must have seen the flare from our engines.\" \"What should we do?\" asked Jack. \"Nothing,\" said Rogan, snapping at him. \"We'll give away our location again if we use our thrusters. Our momentum is still carrying us towards Ceros-VI. The patrol should be headed towards where we were, not where we are.\" \"Won't it see us anyway?\" Rogan paused, then shook her head. \"This far out from the system's star? Probably not. They have lights, but they're for short distance searches. With any luck they'll dismiss the glare from our thrusters as nothing but a reflection bouncing off a piece of space-junk.\" Jack looked back out at the patrol ship. It was definitely getting closer. \"You think that'll work?\" he asked. \"There's no chance we could outrun it?\" \"Sure. We're probably faster.\" \"Then why don't we do that?\" \"Because we can't outrun the missiles it'll fire once it sees us. Now stop talking. And for bolts' sake, will somebody kill the lights and screens?\" Everyone fell silent. Tuner flipped a switch under the dashboard and everything inside the cockpit turned dark. The golden forcefield outside the windows rolled out of frame as the Adeona tumbled lifelessly through space. With each slow rotation of the ship, the security patrol appeared to grow a little nearer. \"Come on,\" whispered Jack, clutching at the leather straps of his captain's chair. Everybody held their breath. Or Jack did, at least – the automata simply froze in their positions, not moving an inch, which he guessed was their equivalent. If the Negoti patrol had even the slightest suspicion that the Adeona was trying to sneak through the Ceros system, it would blow the ship right back out of it – this time in a million different pieces. And nobody would ever come sifting through the wreckage for him. Nobody would even know he'd died out there at all. He went to reach for the photograph, only to remember that it was ruined. Just when it looked as if the patrol was headed on an interception course with the Adeona, it veered off to the right. Jack let out a sigh of relief. Even though it couldn't have been any closer than a kilometre or so away, it felt as if they'd missed each other by mere inches. If they'd been two jet fighters flying in broad daylight, they would have spotted each other for sure. Once the automata were confident the patrol wasn't looping around for another pass, Tuner switched the lights back on. The blue hologram of the solar system popped back up from the table. Rogan studied their new, uncontrolled trajectory with a stern expression. \"Okay, everyone back to their stations.\" She turned and faced Jack. \"Keep the main thrusters off until we reach the planet's upper atmosphere. I've labelled a viable entry point on your NavMap – until then, use the air thrusters if you need to keep the ship steady.\" Jack nodded and spun his chair back round. A flat, green hologram had been superimposed over the windows in front of him. A dotted arrow plotted the best path between the ship and Rogan's suggested destination. Tapping the paddles on either side of the joystick, Jack brought the Adeona back under control. He knew the ship could have done it herself with far less trouble had her navigation systems not been compromised by the disrupter mine, but he appreciated the chance to practice. He was about to fly through the guts of a planet. He needed all the practice he could get. * * * As they broke through the upper atmosphere of Ceros-VI, Jack was filled with a plethora of questions… the most pressing of which were how and why it still had an atmosphere at all. \"More gravity wells,\" said Rogan, standing beside Jack. They both looked down at the planet. \"It's much easier to mine an asteroid or even a moon than it is a whole planet – that's why they crack them apart. But that's quite an explosive procedure, as I'm sure you can imagine. The detonation leaves behind a small artificial gravity well, which keeps the chunks – and with them, the planet's atmosphere – from flying off into space.\" \"Like a miniature black hole?\" asked Jack. Rogan bobbed her head from side to side. \"Sort of… but not really. More like a deep chasm in space-time. Think of a bowling ball on the surface of a trampoline, stretching it down. We might survive the trip inside, but it would take more fuel than we have to get back out. And gravity does weird things to time – who knows what year it would be when, and if, we escaped.\" Jack swallowed hard. \"So we want to avoid the planet's core, then?\" \"What's left of it, yes,\" said Rogan, patting the edge of Jack's seat. \"Best if you stick to following the crust around, if you can. Tuner, how's the signal blocking going?\" Tuner wriggled out from his cubby hole. \"No successful pings yet, but it's getting harder and harder to scramble their radar.\" He sounded stressed. \"We ought to be quick. Their video scanners must surely know something's up by now.\" \"Keep going,\" said Rogan, nodding to them both. She returned to the hologram table before any more questions had the chance to slip off Jack's tongue. He did as she said, gently guiding the Adeona towards Rogan's NavMap destination with only the most minimal use of the ship's thrusters. Their flames were far less visible now that they'd entered Ceros-VI's atmosphere, but they'd hardly go unnoticed by patrols on the lookout for intruders. Uninterrupted, they would reach the planet's surface in less than a minute. Although Ceros-VI still retained an atmosphere, it was thin – a pale, white-blue line on the horizon that barely rocked the Adeona's hull upon entry. There weren't clouds floating in the skies below so much as a thin, blanketing mist, one which occasionally showered the broken planet with light rain but just as often spilled the precious water down through the cracks, where its droplets tumbled longways and lengthways towards the core. The planet rose up to greet him. Colossal green forests waved as if celebrating their arrival. Translucent lakes lay pocketed amongst the trees. Even now, flocks of small birds migrated from one planetary chunk to another. Far from the dusty red rock Jack had thought it would be, the fragments of Ceros-VI were teeming with life. It could have been a paradise, once upon a time. He couldn't understand why anyone would want to destroy such a beautiful thing. \"I thought you said the Negoti Corporation bought the Ceros system because it didn't harbour any life?\" he said to Brackitt. \"It didn't harbour any advanced life,\" replied Brackitt, shaking his head. \"If automata don't have any rights, why would you expect anyone to care about a few trees?\" \"It's terrible.\" \"Welcome to the galaxy.\" Jack could have sworn he heard a hint of exasperated laughter in Brackitt's voice. \"It's a pretty terrible place.\" \"We've been picked up on the radar.\" Tuner suddenly emerged from the maintenance hatch. \"Sorry, everyone. Patrol ships are on their way.\" \"No need to apologise, Tuner.\" Rogan brushed her hologram aside and marched down to the front of the cockpit. \"We figured this would happen sooner or later. Do you know where you're going, Jack?\" \"Sure do.\" \"Is the Adeona ready?\" Brackitt paused, then nodded. Rogan crossed her arms. \"Then let's take her inside.\" Jack guided the Adeona towards the largest chasm Rogan had been able to locate with the ship's scanners – at its mouth, it stretched almost a mile across. For now, it was like riding a scooter down an empty freeway… but they all knew the landscape could change without warning. What was presently a canyon might become a hairline fracture in an instant, crushing whatever foolish ship happened to be passing through. Thick roots stuck out from the soil where the chunks of planet had broken apart. Rocks and dirt came loose where the pieces had recently collided together, falling downwards and inwards. Water spilled out from where underground streams had been cut in half. Jack couldn't see much further than that. Anything deeper than the uppermost level of crust was cast in a thick darkness so black that had it not been for the lack of stars, Jack might not have believed anything lay there at all. He wiped his sweaty hands against the edge of his chair, then tightened his grip on the controls. \"Don't worry,\" said Rogan, noticing the nervous expression on Jack's face. \"By the time they work out what our plan is, we'll be long gone. Nobody would be stupid enough to follow us in there.\" Jack went to swallow but found his throat too dry. That's what he was afraid of.",

      "title": "Journey Through the Cracked Planet",
      "content": "17 Journey Through the Cracked Planet The thick, sweeping floodlights of the Adeona cut through the dark and dusty chasm like a broadsword. Large boulders floated in their gaze. Stray rocks and pebbles clattered harmlessly across the ship's hull. So far, so good. Jack hadn't crashed into any of the canyon walls yet, nor any of the rock faces levitating above and below. But controlling the Adeona in such a tight environment was proving harder than he'd anticipated. With her main rear thrusters offline – partly to conserve fuel, partly to save from ploughing into the first corner he came across – the only way he could turn was to fire short bursts from the air thrusters that ran down her flanks. It was nervous, twitchy work. Slow, too. But slow meant safe, and when every narrow corridor felt like a set of hungry cosmic jaws waiting to chow down on them, everybody on board felt that safe sounded pretty damn good. A gargantuan mass of asphalt-grey rock rose sharply overhead. Jack rammed the joystick forward and threw the Adeona into a steep dive. They levelled out just as the skyscraper-sized rock crashed into the cliffs behind them. The thin atmosphere had leaked down from the surface – though they couldn’t hear the impact, they all felt its vibrations. \"I think we've drifted towards the asthenosphere,\" said Rogan. She studied the unusual material with awe. \"Look at the way the molten rock has cooled and hardened having lost the heat from the planet's core. Don't worry,\" she added, \"we're still nowhere near the gravity well. Stick to heading starboard, if you can.\" Jack suppressed a shiver and continued onwards. He was flying through the bowels of a planet that seemed intent on killing him, and his hands were starting to cramp up. Rogan's geology lessons could wait. His interest regarding the landscape changed after a further thirty minutes of flying through stark, monotonous canyons and – depending on the orientation of the ship – narrow slits that letterboxed his vision. When he caught sight of a bright blue glow in the distance, he turned the Adeona towards it without thinking. \"What is that?\" he asked aloud. Brackitt looked up from his dashboard and shrugged. Tuner climbed up from his cubby hole and Rogan adjusted the magnification of her eye lenses. \"I have no idea,\" she replied, her expression blank. Jack was taken aback. Up until then, he'd assumed Rogan knew everything. \"Take us closer if you can, but be careful.\" As the Adeona glided between tight walls of rock, the blue glow grew ever brighter, then divided into two, then the two into four, and so on. At first Jack wondered if they might be some sort of radiant life form – like flying, glow-in-the-dark jellyfish or something. It already felt as if he were piloting the Adeona through the deep blackness of the ocean abyss as it was. But then the lights revealed themselves to be just that – industrial lights, embedded in the side of a massive rock chunk. Small, unmanned ships were boring into it with razor-sharp drills. The rock chunk split. More of the drilling ships swept in, breaking it down further still and syphoning all the precious material through the channels in their drill heads. \"So that's how they do it,\" said Rogan, nodding. \"Interesting. I've never witnessed planetary mining before.\" \"Are they automata?\" asked Jack. \"They're automated, not automata,\" she replied. \"No sentience, no genuine thought. They don't even know they exist. Still, give them a wide berth. We don't know how they communicate with the central station, or what they might tell them.\" \"Will do,\" said Jack, listing the ship to the left. \"Hold on,\" said Brackitt. His voice sounded frantic. He tapped a button and threw a new holographic display across the front windows. \"Does anybody know what that is?\" The green, 3D-matrix image clearly resembled the Adeona as she was at that moment, floating in an ever-shifting labyrinth of rock. Jack guessed the ship was picking herself up on her own short-range scanners. Ahead and to the right of them were the drilling machines. To the left, another empty chasm. Behind them, something was coming in fast. \"A missile,\" said Rogan, her eyes growing wide. She shook Jack by the shoulders. \"Fly, Jack. Fly!\" \"Whose bright idea was it to fly through a bloody planet anyway?\" muttered Jack, throwing the left lever as far forward as it would go. The Adeona rocketed down the chasm to the left, her thrusters suddenly at full power. The rocky corridor was tight – barely twice the width of the ship – and Jack struggled to keep her from bashing off the walls. He suspected the Adeona was helping to stabilise herself as best she could. \"Is it still behind us?\" he yelled over his shoulder. Rogan had moved the scanner hologram over to the table so that it wouldn't impede Jack's view. \"Closer than ever,\" she shouted back. \"Try to lose it.\" \"Try to lose it?\" Jack laughed desperately. \"How? I'm flying in a straight line!\" Rogan spun the map around. \"Go up,\" she said. \"Up?\" \"Now!\" Jack wrenched the joystick towards himself, sending the Adeona groaning upwards. Thanks to the artificial gravity inside the ship, the pressure wasn't half as bad as it would have been in a fighter jet. Only one automata fell over behind its console. The view went from one narrow crack to another. Jack could have sworn that somewhere, far in the distance, he saw a tiny sliver of starlight… but a second later it was gone, blocked out by another roaming slab of planet. Perhaps they were close to the other side. Or perhaps it had only been the light from the Adeona's floodlights, reflecting off a cluster of Somnium crystals. Either way, he was headed in that direction. \"Did that work?\" he shouted. \"No,\" sighed Rogan. He hated hearing defeat in her voice. \"It's still on our tail.\" Jack spotted another crack on his right, and used the ship's airbrakes to drift inside it without slowing. The missile, a video feed of which was now being projected onto one of the windows, followed close behind, its fierce blue flame scorching the walls of rock as it passed. \"Goddammit,\" snapped Jack, taking another sharp turn. \"Who fired a rocket at us this time, anyway?\" \"I don't think anyone did,\" replied Rogan, pointing at the video. \"It looks like a proximity mining torpedo.\" \"Maybe it detected our movement near the dig site and labelled us a loose rock that needs destroying,\" said Tuner. \"Nah, I don't buy it.\" Jack turned once more. He scraped the Adeona's hull against an unexpected outcrop and winced as sparks showered across the windows. \"That rocket is designed for keeping intruders out, not clearing debris. Why else would somebody set explosives around a spot where their own machines are working?\" \"I don't know, Jack! Do you want to pull over and ask?\" Jack went to reply with something unquestionably witty, only for his blood to turn so cold that his words froze in his throat. He mouth gaped open instead. The crack they were following petered to a point too small for the Adeona to pass through. The chunks of planet had collided and locked together. They were headed for a dead end, and the walls were closing in. \"Erm, guys?\" he finally screamed. \"Anywhere on that map of yours?\" \"Only back the way we came,\" replied a distraught 11-P-53. \"I was hoping you wouldn't say that. How far behind us is the torpedo now?\" \"Eighty metres and closing,\" said 11-P-53. \"I should never have agreed to this…\" Eighty metres was only a couple of ship lengths. If he stopped now, the rocket would tear through the back of them in less than a second. He still remembered a few tricks for evading homing missiles from his time at the Academy… but they were manoeuvres to be deployed outside in the open air, not inside a collapsing planet. Did he even have the space? He guessed he was about to find out. Jack plunged the joystick forwards and then, just when the Adeona had begun her suicidal dive, yanked it back towards him. At the same time, he triggered almost half of the ship's air thrusters. This had much the same effect as pulling the handbrake in a speeding car – the Adeona performed a clumsy but immediate one-eighty degree turn, a move impossible through her rear thrusters alone. This time not even the artificial gravity could counteract the pressure of such a turn. Jack's vision went grey as the blood rushed out from the vessels around his eyes. Something in his chest cracked. His head swam and he felt an urgent need to vomit. But there wasn't time to worry about that. The Adeona's sudden reversal in trajectory confused the torpedo's tracking software. It rocketed past the ship, missing it by mere metres. Jack rammed the accelerating lever forwards again, and the ship raced back towards the entrance of the chasm. The mine attempted to correct its own course in the increasingly narrow space, but its turning circle was much too wide. It crashed into one of the walls and detonated. The planetary chunks to either side first cracked and then ruptured, flinging giant pieces of rock in every direction. \"Hold on,\" said Jack, as the Adeona was peppered with burnt earth. He made another sharp, albeit less painful turn out of the chasm's mouth just as it collapsed completely. Jack brought the ship to an abrupt halt a few seconds later. Colour returned to his vision. \"Everyone all right back there?\" he asked. Rogan staggered towards his chair. \"Nothing that can't be buffed out, I hope,\" she replied. \"That was some good flying, Jack.\" \"It was excellent flying,\" said 11-P-53, climbing to its feet. \"But he burned through half our remaining fuel doing it. We'll struggle to get out of this planet, let alone all the way to Detri!\" \"Better than being dead,\" said Tuner, shrugging. \"Tuner's right.\" Rogan crossed her arms. \"Besides, we'll be fine so long as we can make the jump to subspace. We still have enough Somnium left for one last skip, and then we can coast the rest of the way once we're in orbit around Detri.\" 11-P-53 threw up its hands. \"Don't blame me if we get stranded out here,\" it said, marching out of the cockpit. \"I told you we should have tried our luck sneaking through the station.\" \"It wouldn't have worked without the security codes and you know it.\" Rogan waved the cantankerous robot out of the room. \"Don't listen to 11-P-53, Jack. It just wishes it was still sitting in the captain's chair, that's all.\" Jack blushed and bowed his head. Stealing 11-P-53's sense of captaincy had never been his intention. The poor automata was welcome to take it back the moment the Adeona left the system. \"Speaking of which,\" said Jack, half talking to himself, \"let's not hang around. I reckon that gap over there's a way out. I can see something glittery behind it. Might be stars.\" Rogan looked where Jack was pointing. Her eye lenses grew wide again. She took a step back from the dashboard. \"That's not a gap,\" she said, shaking her head, \"and those aren't stars.\" \"Oh.\" Jack shrugged and readjusted the belts of his chair. \"Somnium crystals or something, then. It's worth a shot.\" Rogan reached over and grabbed Jack's hand before he could push the accelerator. She tapped a button in front of him. One of the windows magnified itself three-fold. \"Does that still look like a crystal to you?\" she snapped. Jack had to concede that it did not. He was no expert, but he was pretty sure most crystals couldn't blink. Then again, he'd never believed an eye could be silver or the size of a house, either. \"Now we know who the proximity torpedo was for,\" said Rogan, whispering as if it might hear them. \"We need to turn around very, very slowly.\" \"What the hell is that thing?\" said Jack, his hands frozen. Whatever the creature was, it blinked again… and then rolled its silver eye towards them. \"Big,\" said Tuner. \"Big, and hungry.\" 11-P-53 ran back into the cockpit and shook Jack out of his petrified stupor. \"Screw the fuel reserves!\" it yelled. \"Just get us out of here!\" As soon as Jack ignited the ship's thrusters, the colossal beast lunged after them. It bulldozed through the surrounding rocks as if they were lumps of marshmallow. Jack swung the Adeona around and launched it back the way they came. \"Good grief,\" he screamed, glancing at a video feed from the back of the ship. \"That thing's a monster!\" The darkness around them was near-absolute, but what Jack could see terrified him. Tentacles whipped across the rock faces on either side like steel cables, cutting through the stone. Rows of needle-thin teeth gnashed up and down, each as long as a train carriage, glinting like knives in the brief flashes of floodlight. The rest of its body remained hidden in shadow. There was little doubt that the creature was gigantic enough to devour the ship. The question was, could it manage it in one bite or two? \"Come on, guys. Give me some help here!\" Rogan, Tuner and 11-P-53 were back at the hologram table, swiping through maps of the planet. \"I don't know what to suggest,\" Rogan cried out. \"The pieces of the planet are shifting around too much. It's not as if any of the maps actually match!\" The Adeona's floodlights picked up a rock formation arching between two floating chunks. Jack sent the ship gliding under it. The creature went crashing through it less than a second later. \"Just tell me which side of the planet is closest!\" \"Left,\" shouted Tuner. \"Go left!\" Jack's hands were so sweaty they almost slipped right off the joystick. He yanked it to the left, praying for an exit in that approximate direction. He found one, though not one as early as he would have liked. The Adeona clipped the edge of a rock with a painful crunch. \"Is she all right?\" asked Jack. The ship maintained her breakneck pace. \"She's fine,\" said Brackitt. \"A bit bruised, but nothing a mining ship can't shrug off. Down to six percent fuel, by the way.\" \"That's not helping.\" Jack glanced at the rear-view screen again. Not only was the monster still following them, it was even closer than before. He was convinced he saw one of its tentacles snap past the ship's window like a charioteer's whip. Another chunk of planet fell and blocked the path ahead. Jack swore and swerved left, then immediately banked right to get around it. His heart pounded so hard his vision started to shake. And then, with a little white flash of hope, he saw them. Stars. The way out. The Adeona must have seen them too, because she rose to a speed faster than anything the accelerator alone would allow. Jack struggled to hold her steady, though by that point he suspected he had barely any control over her at all. He could hear the metal of her hull groaning from the strain. And still those teeth stabbed up and down like knives behind her thrusters. Their starlit exit grew closer and closer. \"Come on, come on,\" he groaned. Jack could hardly keep from shutting his eyes. And then suddenly they were free, launched clear from the cracked planet's gravity by the force of their own momentum. The creature crashed into the continent-sized chunks on the surface and flailed at the escaping ship with its long, squid-like tentacles. It gave up and slid back inside, but not before Jack caught sight of a leathery hide the size of a cruise ship. 11-P-53 picked itself up off the floor for the second time. \"Never offer to do anything for us ever again, you hear me?\" \"Believe me, I won't.\" Jack's stomach heaved but he kept his kwagua berry down. \"From now on—\" He looked out of the window and – despite his nausea – broke into a smile. \"It's a clear path,\" he said, waving Rogan and Tuner over. His heart fluttered. \"Look, everyone. There are no planets or stations in the way. We're through!\" The automata rushed over to the windows on the left side of the cockpit. The golden, flickering Ceros Gate stretched out ad infinitum behind them. The Negoti Corporation's central space station lay only a few thousand clicks away, rotating slowly on its artificial axis, half obscured by Ceros-VI. Ships were passing through its security checkpoint and skipping off into subspace. Each disappeared with the twinkle of a shooting star. \"Move!\" 11-P-53 ushered Jack out of the captain's chair and took his place. \"We need to leave this system before they pick up our signal again.\" \"Not bad, eh?\" said Jack, elbowing Rogan where her ribs would have been. \"For a fleshy,\" she replied with a smirk. \"Okay…\" 11-P-53 pressed a complicated series of buttons to get the skip drive ready. \"The route to Detri's orbit is set. Making the jump in three… two…\" But 11-P-53 never made it to one. The view outside the window went from a beautiful brushstroke of red and purple stardust to a gunmetal grey wall as a scorched and battle-scarred starship punched its way into the Ceros star system. Jack staggered backwards. Besides the Arks, he'd never seen a ship of such magnitude. He'd certainly never stood so close to one before. There seemed to be no end to its sheer, featureless hull. \"I guess we weren't as well hidden from the Negoti Corporation as we thought,\" he said, unable to tear his eyes away. Rogan shook her head and pulled Tuner close. \"That's not Negoti,\" she said in a quiet voice. \"That's Charon.\"",

      "title": "Charon’s Ultimatum",
      "content": "18 Charon’s Ultimatum The video message arrived less than a minute later. Nobody said or did much in the meantime. The automata looked defeated, like chess players who know there's no move left for them to play. Many had fled the cockpit to hide in the ship's many nooks and crannies. 11-P-53 remained slumped in the captain's chair, its head bowed low. Rogan kept patting Tuner on the back. \"We're doomed,\" sighed Tuner, \"aren't we?\" Clearly Rogan didn't want to lie, because she didn't answer. Jack crossed to the windows on the other side of the cockpit. A few Negoti patrol ships were coming to join the battlecruiser, though they didn't appear to be in any great hurry. He guessed they'd known of its arrival ahead of schedule. They were probably only there to keep an eye on proceedings. Against the inordinate bulk of the battlecruiser, they looked even more pathetic than the Adeona… like flies buzzing around a wildebeest's behind. \"Why haven't they blown us up yet?\" he asked. \"They're not going to,\" said Rogan. \"Probably. They'll want to capture us and put us back to work. The ship, especially.\" \"Not me,\" said Tuner, fidgeting. \"I stole their plans. They'll root around inside my head and then throw me into a crusher.\" Jack didn't know which made him feel worse – that poor Tuner spoke so resignedly of his punishment, or that nobody in the cockpit tried to correct him. His eyes were drawn back to the expressionless battlecruiser blocking their path. He couldn't help but imagine the alien horrors waiting for him inside. That Gaskan creep needed the automata – at least until he had the blueprints back in his possession. But what would they do when they discovered a random human on board, too? Put him to work on this mysterious superstructure the automata kept banging on about? Toss him out of an airlock without a helmet? Chop him up and turn him into Raklett rations? He opened his mouth to give a rousing speech about the merits of making a run for it, but it was at that moment the message turned up. Scores of video screens exploded across the windows of the Adeona, replicating over one another like the galaxy's most irritating computer virus. From each one glared the same face. Jack recoiled, shuddering as if with a fever. The creature before him was grotesque. The entire surface of its glossy, red head was disfigured with thick and violent scratches. From behind sprouted a pair of large, twisted horns, not unlike a ram's. Then Jack's panic abated, and he saw the truth – the creature hid its true appearance behind a mask. The horns had been soldered onto what must have once been a sleek ruby helmet. Jack suspected the creature was no less hideous underneath, however – the crimson armour it wore over its slim torso was painfully mangled and warped. \"I'm guessing that's Charon,\" whispered Jack, inching away from the dashboard. \"He can't see us, can he?\" Rogan shook her head. \"It's a recording. I don't even think he's in the same system as us.\" The ship's comm speakers crackled into life. \"To all those aboard the Adeona,\" said Charon, \"heed my warning well. This will be your only one.\" The mask amplified the warlord's voice. His words were perfectly clear. Calculated menace dripped off every sharp syllable. Yet the voice surprised Jack. It carried not the rage and arrogance of youth that he expected, but rather the laboured tones of an older, perhaps even wiser man. \"Your crew is the sole property of the Iris project,\" said Charon, tilting his head to the side. \"You are mine. You belong to me. You are fugitives in a stolen ship, also mine. I would be completely in my right to have my battleship torch you all to ash.\" \"Get everyone to the airlock,\" 11-P-53 said to Brackitt. \"Be ready to jump out if they open fire on us.\" \"What about me?\" hissed Jack, as Brackitt ran from the cockpit. \"I'm not an automata. I can't survive in a vacuum, remember?\" \"Then it sounds like you're screwed either way.\" 11-P-53 shrugged. \"Don't worry. If they launch their rockets, we all are.\" \"Yet for the sake of brevity, I am willing to make a deal,\" Charon continued. \"None of you are of any consequence. You are all expendable, your positions on the project already filled. But one of you stole something important from me. I cannot let that pass. Hand the offending automata over to my associate, and the rest of you shall be free to leave unharmed.\" Charon leaned towards the camera so that his mask filled most of the frame. \"You have three minutes to comply.\" Every video screen around the Adeona shut down at once. Nobody said anything. Everyone turned to look at Tuner. \"Please don't,\" he said, cowering. \"Of course we won't hand you over,\" said Rogan, giving him a sorry look. \"We're in this together. Besides, he's lying. The second they have you on board that battlecruiser, he'll send the order to obliterate us.\" \"And they'll obliterate us if we don't,\" said 11-P-53, pacing back and forth. He paused. \"Not that I'm saying we should send IL-6-88 over to them, of course. But if there's even the tiniest chance…\" \"There isn't,\" snapped Rogan. \"He's not going.\" 11-P-53 raised its hands in surrender and continued pacing up and down the cockpit. \"He's bluffing,\" said Jack, waggling a finger at the battlecruiser in front of them. \"They won't blow us up if we refuse to give them Tuner. If anything, they're more likely to blow us up if we do.\" \"Oh yeah?\" said 11-P-53. \"And how did you arrive at that genius conclusion?\" \"We don't have time for this,\" said Tuner, tugging at Rogan's hand. \"Let Jack speak,\" she said. \"If destroying both us and the blueprints in Tuner's head was an option, don't you think Charon would have done it by now? Tuner, be honest. Did you make a copy of their plans, or did you just move the original file from their server onto your hard drive?\" Tuner bowed his head. \"I copied it and erased the original,\" he mumbled. \"I thought maybe we could use it for leverage.\" Rogan gasped. 11-P-53 grunted in frustration. \"No wonder Gaskan came after us, you bolt-brain,\" Rogan snapped. \"You're carrying the only copy of the blueprints they have!\" \"Exactly!\" Jack couldn't help but break into a desperate grin. \"If they just wanted to make sure you guys couldn't sell the plans, we'd be dead already. The fact that Tuner stole the originals is the only reason we're still alive!\" \"It's the only reason we're in this mess, too.\" 11-P-53 shook its head. \"How could you be so stupid?\" \"Sorry,\" said Tuner. \"It's all right.\" Rogan flashed 11-P-53 another stern look. \"So what should we do? Wait out the three minutes and see what happens?\" \"It's just the one minute now…\" mumbled Tuner, fidgeting. \"No.\" Jack crossed his arms. \"We don't wait for them to make their move. We make one of our own.\" \"You think we should try to run?\" she asked. \"Why not? Anyone got a better idea?\" The automata all looked at one another. \"If we can get around the battlecruiser, the Adeona could jump to subspace,\" said 11-P-53. It sounded as if it were coming around to the idea, but then it sighed. \"But they followed us here, somehow. Who's to say they won't follow us someplace else?\" \"Then we'll be in no worse a situation than we are now,\" said Rogan. \"Apart from having no fuel left in our engine or skip drive, that is.\" \"At least it'll wind Charon up,\" said Tuner. Everyone looked at 11-P-53. \"Fine,\" it said, marching over to the captain's chair. \"But I'm flying, got it?\" \"She's all yours,\" said Jack, standing back. \"We have ten seconds left.\" Tuner was practically jumping up and down with anxiety. \"You might want—\" 11-P-53 didn't wait for anyone to be ready. Jack supposed it thought that if nobody on board the Adeona knew what to expect, then neither would anyone on board the battlecruiser. It wasn't the worst logic ever. The ship accelerated and dived with the full force of her thrusters. And then everything… stopped. The fabric of the universe appeared to ripple for the slightest of moments, and then everything turned silent. The Adeona's engines switched off. The lights and screens across the bridge went dark. Jack felt his body lift up off the floor. \"Erm… what's happening, guys?\" Nobody answered. Up front, 11-P-53 sat limp in its chair. Jack glanced over at Rogan and Tuner. They were floating as well. That much didn't scare him – he was in space, after all – but the sight of their lifeless eyes was more than his shattered nerves could bear. The power hadn't just gone out across the ship – it had gone out of his friends, too. He tried to grab hold of a nearby seat, but missed. The battlecruiser must have fired an EMP – an electro-magnetic pulse. Everything even vaguely electronic had gone dark, including the artificial gravity. His heart hammered faster and faster. If that had gone, how long would it be before the life support systems shut down as well? How long would it take for the ship to run out of air? From somewhere deep inside the ship came a faint hissing noise. Either the Adeona had burst a pipe or somebody was trying to get inside. Jack twisted himself around in mid-air and used the back of 11-P-53's seat as a springboard, catapulting himself down the length of the cockpit. He clipped the corner of the hologram table as he passed, and had to grab hold of it to keep from crashing into one of the computer monitors. Zero-gravity flight wasn't half as intuitive as it looked. If Gaskan's troops were boarding the Adeona, he needed a place to hide. He wasn't any good at fighting at the best of times, let alone when he couldn't keep his feet on the floor. And hell – if the Rakletts weren't looking for a human, maybe there was a chance they wouldn't find one. He looked back at Rogan and Tuner. It was over. There was nothing he could do for them now. He lunged at the doorway, grabbing the frame with both hands. His torso slammed into the bottom of the wall beside it, making his eyes water. The whole corridor appeared to be lying on its side. Jack shook his head and tried to pull himself the right way up. The door to his quarters was at the far end, past another pair of deactivated automata. If he could make it there, maybe he could stash himself beneath the bunk in his room, or in one of the storage chests. But he never got the chance. Before he could throw himself down the corridor, a pair of gnarly metal boots stepped out in front of him. Jack raised his head and the butt of a rifle came down to meet it. Everything went black.",

      "title": "The Confession",
      "content": "19 The Confession He could smell the fabric softener Amber used on their bedsheets, sense the heat of the morning sun on his face as it spilled through the blinds on the windows. He could hear the clatter of his wife eating breakfast in the kitchen. Jack winced. A dull ache in his temples and a soft gurgling in his stomach dragged him back into consciousness. He was nursing one hell of a hangover. Even his chest hurt, for some reason. He mumbled for Amber to bring him a glass of water and a couple of ibuprofen. The dry voice that replied was most definitely not hers. \"I don't know what this Amber of yours is,\" it said, \"but I highly doubt it's in any position to help you now.\" Jack opened his eyes with a start. Gone in an instant were the sounds and smells of his Sandhurst apartment. In their place were the four stark and silent walls of what looked like an operating theatre, albeit one run by a surgeon with an appalling standard of hygiene. Splatters of black mould and blood painted the white tiles. Snaggletoothed cutting tools hung from rails running along the ceiling. Something dead lay curled in the foetal position on a metal trolley pushed up against the far wall. A stabbing pain made him reach for his head, only to discover his arms were pinned against his sides. Jack lowered his chin to his chest. He was strapped to some sort of upright gurney, his arms and legs locked into place by shiny mechanical clamps. Trying to wriggle free only made the clamps lock tighter. \"Such an unusual specimen,\" said the same voice as before. It was brittle like sand yet sharp like broken glass, and it made the hairs on the back of Jack's neck stand to attention. \"And how curious that it would choose to align itself with such defective junk.\" Gaskan Troi walked around to the front of Jack's gurney. Seeing him up close did Jack's troubled stomach no favours. Gaskan's translucent skin wrapped around his skull like cellophane. His eyes were dark, exaggerating their already hollow appearance. His robe was identical to the one he wore at the market – long, burgundy and immaculate. He steepled his withered fingers as he studied Jack. A hovering, barrel-shaped automata floated around from the other side. An assortment of cutting, stitching and cauterising instruments extended and retracted from within its rotund chest cavity. A medical unit once, perhaps – though Jack suspected Gaskan had retrofitted it for other means. Right now it was performing a thorough scan of him and taking notes. Gaskan stepped closer so that his face was only inches from Jack's own. Jack grimaced and turned his head to the side. Every muscle in his trapped body grew tense. \"You were with them at the market,\" Gaskan said, his mouth sneering downwards, \"and now I find you on their ship. Why? What did they promise you?\" \"Promise me?\" Jack tried hard not to breathe – Gaskan had a stale odour like old mushrooms. \"Nothing! They found me floating out in space and picked me up, that's all. I stuck with them because I had nowhere else to go.\" Gaskan's sneer turned up at the edges. \"Drifter trash.\" He shook his head. \"Pathetic.\" \"Where am I?\" asked Jack, once Gaskan had pulled away. \"What did you do with the others?\" \"You're on board my ship, the Confession. As for your friends… they will be undergoing repatriation momentarily. Their drives will be wiped and their shells put to better use. I'm sure we can find something far more inventive to do with you.\" Jack tried breaking out of his restraints with no greater success than before. Gaskan laughed. The medical robot finished its scan and made a hasty retreat to a spot beside the room's only door. \"What became of the Luethian I sent after you?\" Gaskan asked, continuing his interrogation. \"It was his tracking beacon that led me here, so you can imagine my surprise to find no bounty hunter waiting for payment. That's very unlike them.\" Jack didn't know what in the galaxy a Luethian was, but he had to assume the four-armed hitman who'd blown out their skip drive had been a card-carrying member of their tribe. \"What does it matter?\" Gaskan's face turned dark and fierce. He snapped his fingers and his automata shot forwards. From inside its chest extended a buzzsaw, which whirled and whistled about an inch from Jack's forehead. \"Speak, or I'll cut something off.\" \"I shot him!\" said Jack, scrunching his eyes shut. \"He's dead!\" Gaskan's face contorted into an incredulous sneer. Then he burst out laughing. It sounded like frozen twigs being snapped. The rusty medical unit calmly retracted its saw and hovered back to its post by the door. \"You did, didn't you? My oh my – not so pathetic after all.\" He extended one long, bony, quadruple-jointed finger and tapped the piece of scrap metal patching up the hole in Jack's spacesuit. \"Though not before he got a shot off at you, I see. Fascinating, quite fascinating. I should be thanking you. You've saved me quite a lot of money.\" \"You're welcome. Now how about setting me free?\" Again, Gaskan laughed. \"I think not.\" He turned around and approached the door. \"Besides, you're a drifter – where would you even go?\" Jack opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again. The creep had a point. Gaskan paused. He turned back around, studying Jack as if he were some curious riddle Gaskan was forever on the verge of solving. \"Such an unusual specimen,\" he said again. \"What did you say your home world was?\" Jack sighed. The last thing he wanted was to put his planet in the sights of somebody like Gaskan, but the possibility of a buzzsaw slicing through his face seemed a far more pressing concern. \"Earth,\" he said. For somebody with the outward appearance of an unearthed corpse, Gaskan could move surprisingly fast. He marched back across the room and wrapped a spindly hand around Jack's throat. \"Do not lie to me,\" Gaskan spat. His sunken eyes were wide, his grip so strong Jack could hardly breathe. \"I'm not lying,\" said Jack, each word a wheeze. \"I'm a human. We don't come from anywhere else.\" Jack was sure that Gaskan was going to crush his throat like an aluminium can. Perhaps that was his original intention. But then a second later the skeletal alien's grip relaxed and he pulled away, lost in his own thoughts. That was when Jack realised Gaskan's eyes weren't wide with rage, but true disbelief. \"You've heard of Earth before, haven't you?\" Hope rose in Jack's heart like a sudden and violent tide, drowning out the throbbing ache in his bruised neck. \"Tell me you know how to get there. Tell me!\" Gaskan didn't listen. Slowly, his fingers returned to their steeple shape. His mind was elsewhere, racing along its scheming tracks at a thousand clicks a second. Jack shook himself against the locks on his arms and legs, his hands clenching and unclenching, his eyes blurring with tears. \"For Christ's sake, tell me where it is! Please!\" Gaskan nodded to himself as if arriving at a conclusion. He turned back to Jack. A crooked smile spread across his narrow, milky-white lips. \"Oh, Charon shall be pleased,\" he said. \"Retrieving the stolen Iris blueprints was one thing, but this… this could hasten the project greatly. A discovery of such magnitude may even warrant a visit from Charon himself.\" Jack swallowed hard. Perhaps Charon had a penchant for collecting rare and exotic species, or something. Maybe his destiny was to end up inside a glass display case, stuffed like a taxidermy tiger. \"You don't have to do this,\" said Jack, coughing. The throttling and screaming had filled his mouth with the taste of copper. \"Oh, but I do,\" replied Gaskan, grinning further. \"You see, I serve Charon for only as long as my master wills it. The sooner Charon's pet project is complete, the sooner I am free… free to follow plans of a somewhat\"—he waved his hand dismissively—\"grander nature.\" He reached out and tapped Jack's chest plate. \"You, human, are my ticket out of here.\" Gaskan strode to the door – it opened with a hiss. He turned to the automata waiting beside it. \"Upload the scans and the recovered blueprints to my monitor upstairs. I wish to inform Charon of our success myself.\" The automata bleeped in the affirmative and floated out through the open doorway. Before locking the door, Gaskan turned to watch Jack struggle ineptly against his restraints. \"I do hope you're not the best humanity has to offer,\" he said, shaking his head and laughing, \"otherwise you are a very sorry species indeed.\" The door hissed shut, and Jack was left to scream for help alone.",

      "title": "Is it Safe?",
      "content": "20 Is it Safe? Nobody came, obviously. The macabre medical room could have been soundproofed for all Jack knew, and even if it wasn't – who did he expect to come running to his rescue? The nearest human was most likely half a universe away, the crew of the Adeona were all deactivated, dismantled or reprogrammed to serve without question, and he suspected everybody else aboard the Confession would just as quickly eat him as set him free. Five minutes came and went. Once his voice grew too hoarse to scream anymore he went back to wriggling around on his makeshift torture-gurney. When that achieved nothing beyond making his arms sore, he started looking around the room for a different means of escape. And soon realised there wasn't one. He sighed. Some intergalactic explorer he was turning out to be. Gaskan was right – if Jack Bishop was the best humanity had to offer, the species deserved to go extinct. But he wasn't the best. Probably not even in the top half. He was a mediocre engineer, a flunk of a pilot, and a husband to a brilliant, beautiful woman who surely spent each and every night questioning what she had done to deserve someone so utterly disappointing. She might have got a ticket on one of the Arks if she hadn't married him. Maybe she would have gone on to meet a doctor, or an astrophysicist, or an actual bloody pilot – a profession humanity needed. Somebody she needed. Because if it weren't for his failure to make something of himself, she wouldn't be as good as dead. He shook his head. No. He couldn't think like that. There was always a chance she'd be allocated tickets through the lottery. And if – no, when – he found his way back to Earth, they'd be given a pair of first class seats for sure. He'd be hailed a hero. Especially if he returned with a working skip drive – he reckoned even that Reeves fellow would line up to shake his hand if he did that. All he had to do was get back to Earth. To her. And then everything would be all right. He looked over at the dead alien on the metal trolley. It wasn't clear how the creature had died, though Jack suspected it hadn't been from natural causes. There was no blood, nor wounds, nor bruises of any kind. The whole of its shrivelled, hairless body appeared untouched – though of course, Jack had no clue what the poor creature had looked like to begin with. Could he look forward to the same fate when Charon arrived? Was this what he did to his most prized specimens? And why did Gaskan seem so sure that Charon would care about one little human from Earth, for that matter? It was hardly the most impressive planet, even to humans. Why didn't Gaskan just kill him and be done with it? His heart sank. Maybe Earth lay too far out for anyone in the intergalactic community to reach with current skip drive technology. Maybe wormholes were the answer. That would explain why almost nobody had heard of Earth before, and why the human race had never been visited by aliens in the past. Ah well. There was little point in speculating. Besides – if he didn't break free, he could always ask Charon himself. Another bout of jerking back and forth achieved nothing except turn his stomach and send his head into a daze. The scar across his chest was starting to hurt again, too. The effects of that magical fruit must have worn off. He didn't suppose he'd have much luck putting in a request for more at the Confession's galley. He looked over at his left shoulder. The arms of his spacesuit could be removed with a relatively simple click-and-twist motion. It would be pretty easy to slip his arm out, if he could unlock one of them. The problem was that the arms were vacuumed sealed for the exact opposite purpose. The last thing anyone wanted when traversing the dusty plains of Mars was part of their spacesuit coming loose. No amount of deranged wriggling would pry them free. He was looking around for another means of escape – to see if the whole gurney-rack could be toppled over, perhaps – when the door to the room opened with another serpentine hiss. Jack stood up straight, which given his situation didn't prove much of a challenge. Adrenaline surged through his veins and the skin on the back of his neck grew tight. It wasn't Gaskan. It was the medical automata. Honestly, Jack didn't know which was worse. It hovered towards him in complete silence. There was no rumble to its motors, and it didn't say a word. It just… floated. Jack felt his blood turn cold. Every inch of his body screamed at him to run. But all he could do was watch, without daring to even blink, as the automata descended upon him the way a mad surgeon might lean over his paralysed patient. From inside its barrel-shaped body extended a long, sharp drill. \"Oh Jesus, no…\" Jack’s eyes grew wide. He shuddered against his restraints. \"Please don't do this. Please don't… The drill began to spin, emitting a high-pitched whine that made his eyes water and set his teeth on edge. \"Stop. Stop! I'll do whatever you want. For Christ's sake, what do you want? Tell Gaskan—\" The automata darted forwards… and rammed the whirring drill bit into a hole in the side of the clamp around his left arm. It retracted its drill a moment later, and the two halves of the clamp popped open. \"What the hell?\" Jack flexed his arm to get the blood pumping again. It had started to go numb. The automata floated over to Jack's other arm and did the same, then started on the clamps on his legs. With a swelling heart Jack realised the robot wasn't using a drill, but a screwdriver. It was setting him free. \"What's happening?\" he asked, as the automata unlocked the last of his restraints. \"Why are you doing this?\" The medical automata folded its mechanical arm back inside its body. \"The automata Gaskan brought on board,\" it said. \"You were with them, yes?\" \"Yes, I suppose I was,\" said Jack, steadying himself against the gurney. \"Is it really true they stole the blueprints to Charon's project? And that they’re headed to the sanctuary on Detri?\" Jack eyed the robot carefully, cautious about where its line of questioning might be headed. \"That's what I'm told, yes.\" The automata beeped excitedly and leaned in close. \"Vive la résistance!\" it whispered, before hurrying back out the door. Jack stood in stunned silence. Vive la résistance. Seriously? That was the best his translator chip could come up with? \"Hey, wait!\" he said, hobbling to the doorway. \"Why did you free me? And which way do I go to find the ships?\" But the robot was already gone, the corridor outside empty. He sighed. Never mind. He was free, which was a start. Now all he had to do was figure out a way off an alien battlecruiser. How hard could that be?",

      "title": "The Crossroads",
      "content": "21 The Crossroads The corridors, wide and for the most part featureless, seemed to stretch on forever. The panels of light running along the ceiling weren't half as bright as those of the medical room. The angular walls and floors were built from a strange, grey plastic-metal alloy stained with oil and covered in unswept dirt. It gave the battlecruiser's artificial air a peculiar though not wholly unpleasant smell – a cocktail of the natural and mechanical, of an old submarine crossed with a burrow. Jack started off by tiptoeing down the corridors, keeping his back close to the wall in case he ran into any patrolling guards. There had been nobody stationed outside the door of the medical room, and he hadn't seen anybody since. He increased his pace to a light jog, grateful that his footsteps didn't ring out against the floor the way they would have on board the Adeona. He was surprised by the lack of security aboard the Confession, but he supposed it made sense. To effectively patrol a ship that size would require a small army. Why waste the manpower when everyone you brought on board would be either disassembled or strapped to a gurney? Gaskan hadn't expected anyone in his crew to unlock the door and free Jack from his restraints. Perhaps his mistake was not considering his medical automata part of the crew. Speaking of which, he needed to keep an eye out for drones. Jack hadn't spotted any security cameras so far – none visible to the human eye, at least – but that didn't mean there weren't less \"liberated\" automata who wouldn't hesitate to sound the alarm if they saw him. He came to a crossroads between corridors. A small pile of industrial metal crates had been stacked up in the corner. He crouched behind them and peered between the gaps. Finally, a sign of life. Two Rakletts stood outside an open doorway, talking. They were too far away for Jack's translator chip to kick in, and so all he heard was a series of snarls and grunts. They seemed irritated about something, but with Rakletts it was hard to tell. They could have just as easily been telling jokes. It was the first chance Jack had to study them since the incident in the market on Kapamentis, and that had been mostly a blur. They looked no less unpleasant under calmer circumstances. Their hair was matted and greasy like that of a stray dog, their hands and ears war-torn and scarred. Their armour was cobbled together from second-hand scrap, from their loose chest plates to their weathered leather boots. Through each of their stumpy muzzles was pierced a single gold ring. It wasn't that Jack was relieved to run into them, exactly – their presence severely decreased his chance of survival, let alone escape. But it did dash his growing suspicion that he was alone in a prison adrift through space. Plus, if there were guards stationed, he had to be getting close to something. With any luck it would be a dock with a spaceship he could steal. Presuming he could get one up and running, of course… but he would cross that bridge when he came to it. One of the Rakletts said something abrupt to the other, and then they both started marching down the corridor towards Jack's hiding spot. Jack ducked down. There was nowhere else to hide. Nowhere better, at any rate. He'd passed a small loading vehicle a good thirty seconds or so back down the corridor, but there was no way he could make it there without the Rakletts seeing him. He wrapped his arms around his knees and made himself as small as possible. The Rakletts stopped at the crossroads, sniffed, then continued their march down the corridor from which Jack came. Neither so much as glanced in his direction. Jack let out out a sigh of relief, then caught a strong whiff of their sharp, pungent odour as he went to inhale again. They stank of sweat and raw meat. He wondered if they were headed that way on account of his escape. Did anyone even know yet? Wouldn't somebody have sounded the alarm if they did? He supposed it didn't matter too much in the long run… so long as he was gone by the time they figured it out. He stood up from behind the crates and made a quick beeline for the room the two Rakletts had been guarding. With his back up against the wall, he took a nervous peek around the open doorway. His heart leapt. He couldn't believe what he saw. \"Rogan? Tuner? Is that you?\" Two complicated mechanical contraptions like iron ribcages stood side by side – Rogan hung suspended in one, Tuner in the other. Beside each contraption was a computer terminal, from which wires and cables ran into panels on Rogan and Tuner's sides. The lights of Tuner's eyes were dim, as if the machine was draining him of power. When he noticed Jack standing in the doorway, they grew a little brighter. \"Jack? Look Rogan, it's Jack! He's alive!\" Rogan lifted her head. She looked as exhausted as Tuner. There were scratches and dents all over her chassis. \"Huh. We were sure the Rakletts killed you when they came to take us. Glad they didn't.\" \"Gaskan brought me on board for questioning,\" said Jack, looking up and down the corridor. \"Then he decided to keep me around as a gift for Charon, or something. I don't know. Anyway, enough about me. You're alive! Gaskan told me you'd been disassembled already.\" \"Not yet,\" said Tuner. His head sagged. \"They had to make sure they retrieved the blueprints first. Then we'll be processed along with everyone else.\" \"Not if Jack gets us out of these machines.\" Rogan nodded at the computer console beside her. \"Try unlocking me with this.\" Jack gave the corridor another glance and then hurried over to the terminal. What he saw on the screen made no sense. Each numerically-labelled directory led to a dozen others. He had no way of knowing if executing any of the commands he stumbled across would free Rogan or fry her circuits. \"Hurry up,\" whispered Rogan. \"I'm trying!\" Jack tapped fruitlessly at the keyboard. \"None of this means anything to me!\" \"They're coming back,\" said Tuner. Jack froze. \"What?\" \"The Raklett guards.\" Tuner frantically tried to wriggle free. \"I can hear them coming back to get us.\" Jack listened. Tuner was right – down the otherwise silent corridors, he could just make out the faint marching of heavy boots against the floor. He stared at the incomprehensible folder system on the computer screen, then apologetically turned to face Rogan. \"Don't you dare,\" she said, as fear flooded her eyes. \"Look, I…\" \"Jack?\" Tuner flopped against his restraints. \"What's going on?\" \"He's leaving us behind,\" said Rogan, shaking her head. \"I always knew you were a coward, Jack Bishop. Afraid to step up. Afraid to do the right thing.\" \"Rogan…\" \"Tell me I'm wrong, Jack. Please. Tell me you don't run away from something the second you get scared.\" \"I've got to get back to Earth,\" he said, gritting his teeth. \"If they catch me here, I'll never get back to my wife. I can't lose her. She's all I have.\" \"Do you know what we've lost, Jack? Do you have any idea what we've had to sacrifice to get this far? Of course not. Who cares about a few stupid automata, right? All you think about is yourself.\" \"No. All I think about is her.\" The sound of footsteps grew louder, the Rakletts closer. Rogan turned her face away from him. \"You'd better leave.\" Jack shrugged. He didn't know what else to say. \"I'm sorry,\" was the best he could manage. * * * Jack only stopped running a minute later. He collapsed onto the bottom step of the first stairwell he came across and buried his head in his hands. He felt sick – even more so than before running out and grabbing the plasma rifle back on Haldeir-B. Without his help, Rogan and Tuner would be dismantled… or disassembled… or whatever the hell Gaskan had planned for them. But if he went back to rescue them, he'd be caught for sure. He screamed into the palms of his hands. Rogan was wrong. He wasn't a coward. A coward wouldn't risk their life standing up to a bounty hunter, would they? Except a part of Jack knew she was right. Deep down, he knew. His heroics back on Haldeir's moon hadn't been due to bravery alone – it had been desperation, too. Desperation to not be left behind on an alien world… to not lose the one chance he had of finding a way back home. He'd been fighting for himself as much as for anyone else. That's why he'd shot the bounty hunter. That's why he'd flown the Adeona through Ceros-VI. And that's why he was getting off this ship, by any means necessary. Still. What else was he expected to do? He took a deep breath, stood up, and turned left into the adjacent corridor. Floor-to-ceiling windows lined the entire right-hand wall. Following a quick and panicked search up and down the corridor's length, Jack dared to press his hands against the thick glass and gaze upon the busy scene below. Two dozen Raklett guards marched down the central aisle of a large hall filled with missile-carrying gunships, bulky supply ships, and even a small, private exploratory vessel. Massive bronze fuel drums stood behind each bay. Showers of golden sparks rained down from repair work being conducted in the iron rafters above. Engines rumbled and thrusters roared. Crates branded with the Negoti logo were loaded onto the spacefaring equivalent of forklift trucks and transported elsewhere on the ship. The hangar! He'd found it. For a split second Jack thought the wall on the opposite side of the hangar was missing, open to the dark, empty depths of space beyond the Ceros system… but then he caught the subtle shimmer of a forcefield as it danced across the starry vista, trapping the battlecruiser's artificial atmosphere inside while permitting ships – and the occasional unlucky prisoner – to pass through like a pebble breaking the surface of a pond. He half ran, half sidestepped his way down the remainder of the hallway, marvelling at the range of ships on display. Any of them would do for his escape, providing he could fly it. Another empty stairwell brought the corridor down to the same level as the hangar floor. Jack approached the open door at the bottom in stunned disbelief, then threw himself to the side as a pair of guards walked past. Had he really seen what he thought he saw? He inched his head back out, then shook it. \"What have they done to you?\" The Adeona stood only a couple of bays away from the door. Somebody had wrapped thick chains around her hull, pinning her to the floor as if she were a wild beast in a travelling circus. She may have tried fighting her way out at first, but her spirit was long gone now. Harsh scratches and dents lined her flank, but Jack suspected these were due more to his erratic flying through the wreckage of Ceros-VI than any abuse from the Rakletts. That said, a few of the ratty bastards were standing not too far from her bay, batting a drone back and forth with the butt of their rifles. All the sense had been knocked out of it. One of the Rakletts gave it a particularly hard whack and it spun onto the floor, buzzing and twitching. Jack recognised it from back at the settlement on Haldeir-B. The bounty hunter had planted it on the Adeona following the removal of his disrupter mine. So that was how the Confession had tracked them to Ceros. Jack sighed. He wanted to rescue the Adeona. He could save her, if nobody else. Plus, he knew how to fly her already… and when it came to elements such as the skip drive, she could probably even fly herself. But that was if he could get those chains off her back. And that was if she was willing to leave all of her automata crew behind… a big thing to ask something – someone – who had apparently rescued them from Charon in the first place. Even if he were able to commandeer her controls against her will – something he seriously doubted was possible – he'd be stealing her from one kidnapper just to take her hostage himself. No, he needed a new ship. One without a conscience, preferably. One with a healthy supply of fuel would be even better. A ship on the other side of the hangar caught his eye. Sharp and sleek, it resembled a chrome arrowhead. It was much smaller than the cumbersome Adeona – with space for a pilot and perhaps a couple of passengers, there was far less risk of taking off only to discover a confused engineer hiding in the fuselage. It might attract more attention flying out of the hangar than if he left in one of the supply ships, but getting away completely unnoticed was likely too much to hope for anyway. Besides, he had more pressing concerns. How he would get across the hangar and learn to fly an alien spaceship without being seen and subsequently shot, for starters. Jack had barely begun to assess the hiding place potential of various crate stacks, fuel tanks and transport vehicles when he noticed a familiar presence floating behind one of the hall's thick iron supports. The medical automata that had freed him earlier didn't look entirely out of place in the hangar – there were a few other automata tending to the ships – but its agitated hovering gave Jack the distinct impression it would have rather been anywhere else. Almost as if it were waiting for somebody. As if it were waiting for something. An escape attempt, perhaps. Jack shut his eyes and clenched his jaw. Goddammit. He didn't have a choice, did he? He reached into the trouser compartment of his spacesuit and pulled out what remained of his photograph. His last rope tethering him to Earth as he forever drifted further away. The edges were even more scuffed and faded than before. Some of it, where it had been burned by the corrosive slug, had first blackened and then flaked away into dust. Jack could still stitch the photograph back together with the help of his memory – see the coastal wind blowing Amber’s hair, see the white of her beaming smile. But how long would it take before he lost that, too? He had to find a way home. For Amber. For the future of humanity. For his own sanity. You've got a good heart, Jack. That's what Amber had said to him the last time he saw her. You're always trying to do the right thing. God, he hated it when she was right.",

      "title": "Revolution",
      "content": "22 Revolution Tuner was the first to be disconnected from the arms and cables of his skeletal prison. He swung a small fist at the Raklett pulling him down. It laughed and casually tossed Tuner onto the floor. The second Raklett yanked a wire out of Rogan hard enough to send sparks flying. She stumbled forwards, clutching at the panel on her side. \"Get up,\" grumbled the two guards. They grabbed an automata each and pulled them to their feet. \"You're wanted downstairs.\" Tuner tried pummelling the Raklett's midriff. The Raklett held him at arm's length with a single hand. \"You tell Gaskan that I'm telling him nothing,\" yelled the small robot. \"Good, because he ain't asking. You're going through processing with the rest of your bolt-bucket crew. Now, get moving.\" The Raklett let go of Tuner's head. Tuner went sprawling across the floor again. He picked himself up and reluctantly allowed himself to be marched out of the door. Something whizzed over the top of his head and smacked into the face of the Raklett behind him with an unpleasant crunch. The alien fell to the ground like a heavy, hairy sack. Tuner looked up to see Jack hiding on the other side of the doorway, wielding a gas canister. \"Jack!\" he said, beaming. \"I knew you'd come back!\" The Raklett escorting Rogan watched its colleague collapse with confusion. Now, seeing Jack poke his head out from the other side of the wall, it pushed Rogan aside and drew up the plasma rifle it had slung over one shoulder. Before it could fire, its spine arched backwards with a jerk and it started jitterbugging across the floor. Its clawed hands coiled in agony and short, crackling zigzags of blue lightning danced across the metal of its patchwork armour. It collapsed in a smoking heap a moment later, revealing an excited medical automata floating behind it. \"Thank you,\" said Jack, emerging from cover. He dragged the first Raklett back inside the room. \"That's twice you’ve saved me now.\" \"Good to see you again,\" said Rogan, trying and failing to suppress a smile. \"I thought you'd be halfway across the galaxy by this point.\" Jack stood up, sighed, and wiped his hands against the legs of his spacesuit. They stank of Raklett. \"Well.\" He looked down at his boots. \"I couldn't go giving us fleshies a bad name now, could I?\" Tuner hurried over and gave Jack a hug. Then he jerked upright. \"We've got to help the others,\" said Tuner, growing frantic. \"They're going to have their drives wiped any moment!\" \"I suppose we'd better go put a stop to that, then,\" said Jack. He picked up the Rakletts' rifles and tossed one of them over to Rogan. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" she asked. \"Your brain is a literal supercomputer,\" said Jack, studying the gun. \"I'm sure you'll figure it out.\" \"I'd rather not.\" She handed the rifle to Tuner. \"Here, take this.\" \"So what's it gonna be, Doc?\" Jack waved the medical automata over. \"You staying here or coming with us?\" \"The revolution is now!\" it declared with glee. \"Is there something wrong with my translator chip?\" asked Jack, showing Rogan the back of his neck. \"No, our new friend really is that enthusiastic,\" she replied, rolling her eyes. \"Come on. Which way's the hangar?\" * * * All four of them crammed around the doorway at the bottom of the stairwell and peered inside the hangar. \"Quite busy, isn't it?\" said Tuner. \"It is, but there's a lot of cover and I don't think anyone's looking for us yet.\" Jack pointed over to the left wall. \"There's the Adeona. They've got her chained to the floor. Anything we can do about that?\" Rogan cracked a smile. \"Don't worry. This won't be the first time we've broken her out of chains. Tuner, you want to do the honours?\" \"No, you and I will help the ship.\" Jack shook his head. \"Tuner needs to go rescue the others. Do you know where they were taken?\" Tuner nodded and pointed down the other end of the hangar. \"I came around from the EMP blast just as we were landing,\" he said. \"They took Rogan and me up to those data-extraction chambers, but everybody else they led through those doors there.\" \"Hopefully wherever they're being held isn't too far on the other side. Take Doc and break them free. But don't do anything stupid, all right? And use the Rakletts' prejudice to your advantage. If you act as if you're supposed to be there, they might not even notice you.\" \"I've never been so happy to be discriminated against,\" said Tuner, tilting his head sarcastically. \"I'm being serious. If you can't get to them, come right back.\" \"We're getting everyone off this battlecruiser,\" said Rogan, her tone extra serious. \"I know,\" said Jack. \"But I'd rather five of us made it out than none at all. Be safe, okay?\" Tuner offered a mock salute and then hurried out the door. Doc floated after him. \"Well, at least he's not walking into a trap this time,\" said Rogan, watching Tuner dart from shadowy cover to shadowy cover. \"Probably.\" \"He'll be all right,\" said Jack, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Now come and show me how to free our ship.\" * * * Tuner and Doc made it across the hangar floor without being noticed. The door to the Confession's holding centre hissed shut behind them. The hall of the holding centre was dark and cold, though neither presented much issue to the two automata. A few bulbs dangled on wires from the ceiling high above, creating stark spotlights amongst the deep shadows. Jack's human eyes may have struggled to navigate the room, but to Tuner the darkness was as bright as a summer day and the spotlights as dark as a winter morning. Stepping (and floating) quietly, they pressed further into the hall. They passed cage after cage. Most lay empty. Scraps of clothing hung on some of their iron bars. Others had floors speckled with dirt and blood, and one was home to a single shard of bone. The hall smelled of copper and bleach, and it was quiet – much too quiet. Tuner started to think that maybe Jack had a point. If rescuing the rest of the crew proved too dangerous, maybe it was best to turn back. No. He had to be brave. Either everyone got off the ship, or none of them did. Besides, he had a plasma rifle now. He reckoned he could take on the whole Raklett army with an actual plasma rifle in his hands. He readjusted the rifle's strap on his shoulder. Even if it was a bit too big to hold properly. Something moved in a cage not far from the aisle down which Tuner and Doc were walking. They sneaked across, keeping to the gaps between cells. Even with night vision, it was hard to tell who was inside. \"11-P-53, is that you?\" The creature lunged at the bars with enough force to raise the back end of its cage an inch off the ground. Spittle sprayed across the two automata. Doc spun backwards, flailing numerous surgical appendages in defence. Teeth like scythes scraped against rusty iron. A paw the size of a dinner plate lashed out at them. \"Shh!\" Tuner backed away, casting his eyes around for guards. Surely they could hear the creature barking? \"Well we definitely won't be bringing you on board the Adeona with us…\" \"IL-8-66?\" whispered a voice from a few cages away. \"Get over here!\" Tuner sprinted over. The entire crew of the Adeona had been crammed into a cage big enough to house maybe half their number. Some of the smaller automata were held aloft by their companions. Others, such as 11-P-53, were pressed hard against the bars. \"11-P-53! You're alive! They haven't erased you yet, have they?\" \"I wouldn't have recognised you if they had, idiot. How in the galaxy did you escape?\" \"Jack saved us. He's helping Rogan free the ship as we speak.\" \"Really? Huh. And who is this?\" \"This is Doc. It's coming with us.\" \"Oh, is it now? Well none of us will be going anywhere unless you can get the keys to this blasted cage.\" Tuner stepped out of the way and the medical automata hovered in front of the cell door. There was no electronic keypad to hack – the door was locked the old fashioned way, with tumblers, bolts and a keyhole. From inside Doc's chest extended a cutting torch. A hot blue flame erupted from the end. \"Stand back, please.\" The automata inside the cage inched away from the door as best they could. Doc began cutting through the bolts. It was slow and delicate work. In the darkness of the holding centre, the resulting sparks burst out like fireworks. Tuner tapped his foot against the floor. He could have sworn he heard a door open on the far end of the hall. \"Come on…\" Yep. Footsteps. Lots of them. Guards were definitely on their way. \"Any time now…\" Doc's torch sliced through the last bolt and the door to the cage swung free. 11-P-53 was closest – it dashed out and held the door open for everyone else. \"Head towards that door,\" said Tuner, pointing towards the exit to the hangar. \"Quickly as you can!\" 11-P-53 turned to Tuner as the last automata left the cage. \"Be honest. How's the hangar looking? Is the coast clear?\" \"Absolutely not. We'll be shot to pieces.\" 11-P-53 contemplated this. \"Well. There are worse things to die for than freedom, right?\" A plasma bolt exploded against the side of the cage. 11-P-53 and Tuner jumped. Three Rakletts stood snarling at the far end of the hall, each with a rifle aimed in their direction. \"Run!\" They sprinted down the row of cages towards the rest of the automata. The rifle around Tuner's neck swung wildly from side to side with every step. Plasma bolts shot past on their left and right, ricocheting off cells and blowing up light fixtures. The beast in the cage started to roar again. \"Go through the door!\" yelled Tuner. Everyone was crowded around it, waiting. \"Don't wait, just go!\" \"It's locked,\" said Kansas, wheeling out from between the legs of the other automata. \"What?\" Tuner stopped beside them and ducked as another bolt from the Rakletts buried itself in the wall above. \"What do you mean, it's locked?\" \"It won't open,\" said another robot, frantically tapping at the panel beside the door. \"The guards must have shut us in.\" \"How long would it take you to hack it?\" asked 11-P-53, pulling Tuner into cover. \"Longer than it would take for those guards to round us all up,\" replied Tuner, looking around. \"Hey. Where's Doc?\" Brackitt poked his head out from behind one of the cages. \"That medical automata you brought with you?\" He pointed towards the wall to the far left of the door. \"Isn't that it, over there?\" Tuner peered across the hall. Doc appeared too preoccupied with cutting open a mesh cabinet with its torch to notice all the gunfire going on around it. \"What does that bolt-head think it's doing?\" asked 11-P-53. Doc finished cutting through the cabinet's lock. It threw the twin doors aside. Inside were rifles. Lots of rifles. Tuner and 11-P-53 looked at each other. \"You have got to be joking,\" said 11-P-53. \"Well, you wanted freedom,\" said Tuner, shrugging. \"Fight for it.\" * * * Jack and Rogan waited until they saw Tuner and Doc sneak through the door to the holding centre before making their own move. The Rakletts were stretched too thin (and on top of that, too stupid) to notice two strangers dart from cover to cover at the back of the hangar. Jack and Rogan had to hide behind a stack of engine parts while two guards marched past – one of them stopped to suspiciously sniff the air, then caught up with his partner – but otherwise their sprint to the Adeona went without incident. The ship perked up as they ducked into cover beside her. The metal chains holding her to the floor creaked and groaned as she fired off a couple of air thrusters. \"It's good to see you too,\" said Jack, reaching up to pat the side of her landing gear. \"Stay still. We don't want to attract attention.\" Rogan tapped at the keypad of the computer terminal beside the Adeona's bay. She turned to Jack and nodded. \"I can get the chains off her from here,\" she said, ducking back down, \"but it won't be quiet. The guards will notice.\" Jack took a deep breath and weighed the rifle in his hands. \"Well, they're going to notice sooner or later. But maybe we should wait until the rest of the crew get here first?\" They peered around the terminal. From where they hid, the door on the opposite end of the hangar was little more than a black speck. \"How do you think Tuner's doing in there?\" asked Rogan, tapping her foot. \"Maybe we should have gone with him.\" \"I'm sure he's fine. If something had gone wrong, I'm sure we'd know about it.\" A bellowing alarm rang out. Red emergency lights started flashing on the walls. \"Yes, I'm sure we would.\" She punched Jack on the arm and went to stand up. \"If Tuner's—\" \"Wait,\" said Jack, pulling her back down. \"What is that?\" The door through which Tuner and Doc had entered remained closed. But a door far to the right of the holding centre had slid open, and from inside hissed a thick cloud of grey-white smoke. Loud bangs could be heard down the corridor beyond. All the Rakletts in the hangar edged forwards, their rifles trained on the opening. Silence fell, if only for the slightest of moments. And then all hell broke loose. Dozens of plasma bolts shot out from inside the smoke. Some missed, burning through crates and canisters – one of the latter rocketed upwards and detonated against the hangar ceiling, showering everyone with red-hot shrapnel. Others tore holes through the Raklett guards lying in wait. Those left alive made a hasty retreat back towards the nearest pieces of cover. The automata came out screaming. Those with arms carried plasma rifles. Those without, and those too small to wield anything bigger than a pocket knife, sprinted towards the Adeona. Tuner, Brackitt and 11-P-53 led the charge, firing wildly upon the spacecraft and fuel drums the remaining Rakletts had taken cover behind. \"Get those chains off the ship,\" said Jack, shaking Rogan out of her stupor. \"Hurry!\" Rogan stood up and pressed a single key on the terminal. The chains unlocked from one another and retracted into pits in the bay floor with a great rattling sound. The Adeona rose up, flexing her air vents and igniting her secondary thrusters. \"Watch the fuel tankers!\" yelled Jack, wincing as her flames licked across the massive bronze drums behind. The first of the fleeing automata rushed into cover beside them. The Rakletts were returning fire now, their plasma bolts scorching the wall behind the Adeona. Jack stood up and fired a couple of shots back in their direction. Tuner slid over to the terminal just as Jack was ducking down again. \"You made it,\" said Rogan, giving him a hug. \"What the hell happened to playing it safe?\" asked Jack. \"We had to fight our way out.\" Tuner leaned to the side of the terminal and fired off a couple of shots. \"There was no other way. I've killed three guards already!\" \"That's horrible!\" Rogan gave Tuner a stern look. \"They started it,\" grumbled Tuner. \"Hey, Adeona.\" Jack struggled to raise his voice above the gunfire. \"Lower your loading ramp! We need to get everyone inside.\" The ship turned on the spot, her landing gear spitting sparks as it scraped against the hangar floor. She bumped into a small shuttle parked in the bay beside her, and it toppled over. Her loading ramp began to descend. \"Everybody on board!\" shouted Jack, firing off a few more shots. \"Hurry!\" The Adeona positioned herself so that she stood between the unarmed automata and the Rakletts, blocking their line of sight. A few of the guards fired on her hull, but her shields – though weaker than those of any gunship – soaked up most of the damage. Rogan began shepherding all the automata without guns into the ship. Jack and Tuner pushed past the Adeona to a stack of crates behind which 11-P-53 was crouched. \"How's it going?\" asked Jack, out of breath. \"Are we winning?\" \"Take a look for yourself,\" replied 11-P-53, nodding towards the battlefield in front. Doc had hung back from the rest of the automata, preferring to take a more… guerrilla approach. It sped from Raklett to Raklett, spinning its saws and slashing its scalpels and igniting its cutting torches like a deranged Swiss-army knife. Furry body parts went flying. Its chassis was painted with blood. \"Good grief. I'm sure glad that thing's on our side.\" \"Doesn't matter,\" sighed 11-P-53. \"We've got a much bigger problem than a dozen guards to deal with.\" Jack's blood turned cold. \"We do?\" \"You see the forcefield over the hangar entrance?\" Jack nodded. It was hard to ignore, given the chilling vacuum of space lurking on the other side. \"Look to the right. What do you think they are?\" Sticking out from the wall on the other side of the Confession's forcefield were two pairs of long, angry-looking cannons, each twice the size of even the largest anti-aircraft gun back on Earth. They swivelled in unison. \"Ah.\" \"It's hardly surprising,\" 11-P-53 continued. The crates beside them shook from another wayward plasma bolt. \"We are on a Class-S Raklett battlecruiser, after all. More guards will be on their way down, but those guns are the real threat.\" \"How do we shut them off?\" asked Jack. \"Shut what off?\" asked Rogan, joining them. They all pointed at the cannons. \"Ah, bolts! Tuner, do you think you could override them?\" Tuner shrugged. \"If I can get onto their system, maybe.\" \"Give me a second.\" Rogan sprinted back to the terminal beside the Adeona's bay. She punched a frustrated hole through its screen a moment later. \"Good news, then?\" said Jack, flinching. \"The Confession's defence systems are kept completely separate from the rest of the ship's subroutines. There's no way to access it from here.\" \"But you found out where we can access it, yes?\" She lowered her eyes. \"The main security terminal… on the bridge.\" Everyone went quiet. \"So that's it, then,\" said Tuner, letting his rifle sag. \"It's over.\" \"Hey.\" 11-P-53 tapped him on the arm. \"Better to die fighting for freedom than live as a mindless drone, right?\" More silence. Jack knew he ought to say something, but he didn't know what. \"Everyone else is on board the Adeona,\" said Rogan, sighing. \"We can leave as soon as you give the order.\" \"We won't make it more than a hundred metres before the Confession blows us into dust,\" said 11-P-53, continuing to lay down fire against the few remaining Rakletts. \"The rest of the crew don't know that,\" she said, laying a hand on his shoulder. \"Let them believe a little longer, while there's still hope in their hearts.\" Jack looked to his left. A number of automata stood at the top of the Adeona's loading ramp, waiting. Anxious lights flashed around the top of Kansas' tiny cylindrical head. Knowing what he did, Jack had to turn his head away. Sod it. He was never getting home anyway. \"I don't suppose you saw how to get to the bridge, did you?\" Rogan shot him a quizzical look. \"What?\" \"I said, how do I get to the bridge?\" \"There's an elevator at the end of that corridor there,\" she said, pointing to a door on their right. \"Should take you straight up. But—\" \"But nothing. If we set off without disabling those cannons, we're all dead. But if I can get up there and shut them down somehow—\" \"You'll never make it back in time…\" \"—if there's even a chance, then it's worth a shot. Come on. What have you got to lose?\" \"You, Jack.\" Tuner sidled over. \"We'll lose you.\" Jack waved Tuner's worry away. \"That's not much of a price,\" he said, trying to smile. \"The world thinks I'm dead anyway.\" \"Jack…\" said Rogan. \"You punch out the second you see those guns go down,\" he said, talking straight to 11-P-53. \"Do not wait around for me, you hear?\" 11-P-53 nodded slowly, as if in shock. \"I hear,\" it said. \"Good.\" Jack gritted his teeth and squeezed his rifle tight. \"Now give me covering fire in three… two… one…\" He wasn't even sure he could run. His legs were shaking and his throat had clenched so tight it hurt to breathe. Yet he did. He ran for that door without so much as a glance at anything else… not the guards who undoubtedly shot at him, nor the friends he left behind.",

      "title": "Gaskan Troi",
      "content": "23 Gaskan Troi Jack raced down the length of the bright, white, hexagonal corridor, glancing over his shoulder at the industrial dark-grey door which had slammed shut behind him. The wailing of the sirens became muted. Softer, distant – the way an alarm clock sounds when one first wakes from a thick dream. The sharp screech of lasers and deep grumble of plasma explosions were reduced to nothing more than vibrations in the floor. Vents along the ceiling let out frigid air in an endless sigh. It kissed the sweat on the back of Jack's neck as he passed. He shivered but focussed only on making it to the elevator. If he stopped to think about what he was doing, he feared he might not start running again. The scar on his chest burned. The calves in his legs felt like lead. His brain screamed with the worst stress headache of his life. None of that mattered. The elevator doors were white too, which Jack discovered when he near enough ran into them. He spun around, clutching his rifle and looking for guards, cameras, drones – anything that might stand in his way. He found nothing. Suspicious, he pressed the lone button beside the curved elevator doors. They slid aside without a sound to reveal a small, cylindrical chamber. Its panels were similarly white and well-lit, though the floor was the colour of red wine. Another lone button waited for him on the left-hand wall. He stepped inside, pressed it with a trembling finger, and prepared for the worst. The doors closed. Other than that, nothing happened. The floor didn't drop away. Gas didn't pump into the chamber. Nails didn't shoot out from the walls like some futuristic iron maiden. Jack couldn't even tell if the elevator was moving. There was no rumble of motors, no whistling whine of cables, no sensation in his stomach of rising or falling. He could have been launched out of the Confession for all he knew, sent on a collision course with Ceros' sun. He wiped fresh sweat from his eyes and tried to control his breathing. Was it a trap? No, it couldn't be. Gaskan had no way of knowing he was on his way up to the bridge. And why would Gaskan make it easier for him if he did, anyway? No – it had to be complacency. Or an oversight, or something. Nobody expected anyone to head deeper into the ship during an escape attempt, that's all. Any and all remaining guards must have been redeployed to the hangar. Still, it all seemed too easy. It would have almost been more reassuring if people had been shooting at him – at least in a firefight he had a decent idea of what the other side were trying to do. The elevator arrived at its destination. There was no indication that it had slowed down, nor any pleasant jingle to mark the end of the journey. The doors simply slid apart again. If they'd opened up on the same white corridor he'd come down, Jack wouldn't have been surprised. Instead, he found himself standing at the rear of an enormous command centre. Many magnitudes greater in size than that of the Adeona, it was the sort of bridge one would expect to find on a battlecruiser. Dozens of expensive-looking computer terminals in sunken rows to the left and right of a grand central walkway; giant video screens showing star maps and ship data in real-time; a viewing window perhaps twenty-five metres in diameter, offering a breathtaking panorama of the Ceros system. Standing in front of the window with its back to the command centre was Gaskan’s tall, gaunt silhouette. Steeling his nerves and tightening his grip on his rifle, Jack marched down the walkway… …and immediately came face-to-face with the security he had expected to find down on the other end of the elevator shaft. Jack had no idea what they were, but they sure weren't Rakletts. They wore sleek obsidian armour that covered every inch of their slim, seven-and-a-half foot frames. Their helmets were flat and featureless – not unlike the one Jack had seen Charon wearing in his video message. Each carried a silver circular throwing blade that flashed blue in the Ceros starlight. Gaskan's personal guard, perhaps. The black-clad guards said nothing, only stared at him. Then they swung their arms back in unison, preparing to throw their weapons. Jack dived behind the partition nearest the elevator just as the two circular blades whizzed past the spot where his head had been a millisecond before. He took it all back. Being shot at wasn't more reassuring at all. The blades carved deep gashes in the wall beside the elevator and clattered to the floor. Jack watched them shake on the spot and then rocket back into the hands of Gaskan's guards. They must have had some sort of magnetic instrument inside their armoured gloves. Jack didn't wait for them to follow him around the partition wall. There was another opening to the bridge a few metres further down – he sprinted the distance and then leapt into the sunken pit beyond. He landed behind one of the computer consoles and winced as a circular saw cut through the air an inch above it. It was on a collision course with the viewing window. Jack grabbed the computer and held his breath. But the blade never made it that far. It slowed to a stop in mid-air and then was yanked back towards its owner as if attached by an invisible bungee rope. Jack took his chance. He popped up from behind the computer and shot two bolts at the guard to whom the blade was returning. She was too focussed on the flight of her weapon to dodge out of the way. The first of Jack's bolts exploded against her torso roughly where a human's ribcage would be. The rifle’s recoil threw off Jack's aim. The second bolt hit the guard closer to her shoulder, but it was still enough to throw her backwards off the walkway. By the time Jack noticed the second blade, it was almost too late. He ducked back into cover but not before it sliced through the fabric of his left sleeve. The blade didn't even slow down. Jack grabbed at the flapping tear in his suit. The damage looked purely cosmetic, but it was hard to tell. Shock could be quelling the pain. A cut that thin might not even bleed for a few seconds. He could still move his arm, so for the moment he guessed it didn't matter. He popped back up, ready to do the same to this guard as he had the last… and then remembered that she hadn't called her circular blade back yet. Jack rolled to the side a nanosecond before the returning weapon could take a few inches off the top of his head. He went to take another shot. But once again the guard was too quick – the blade whistled as it narrowly missed the top of the computer terminal, then sprayed out waves of sparks as it skimmed across it on the way back. He was trapped, exhausted, unable to stand up long enough to aim let alone fire off a plasma bolt. And he was still no closer to shutting down the Confession's exterior cannons so that the Adeona could escape. \"What sort of idiot thinks he can single-handedly commandeer the bridge of a battlecruiser?\" Jack whispered to himself, clenching his jaw. One who expects to die anyway, he realised. He lunged towards the next computer terminal along. He'd hoped to surprise the guard by flanking her, but it didn't work. She almost took his foot off as he scrambled back into cover. For crying out loud. He didn't have time for this. Still the blade kept coming, screeching like a buzzsaw as it lacerated the computer protecting him, each time slowing to a hovering stop a few feet above his head before boomeranging back into the guard's hand. Jack hunkered down even further. A thick, rubbery cable ran out from the back of the computer in front of him and coiled itself into a messy pile by his feet. Jack kicked it aside to make more room for himself, then froze. He had an idea. It wasn't a good one, but it would have to do. He gave the cable a hard yank, pulling its fat plug free from the computer. The machine died with a short, sad whine. He unravelled the cable until it had just the right amount of slack, then stamped his foot down on the other end. Hopefully he had enough weight to hold it. The blade still flashed above his head, then disappeared – flashed, then disappeared. She was toying with him. She thought this was a sport. Well, he'd show her. Or him. Or whatever the alien was. He had no way of knowing when the blade would appear above his head again, but he could count how long it stayed there. From when it first burst into view to the moment it reversed its direction, he had maybe a second to act. Three times he watched it carve through the air above his head. On its fourth pass he threw the cable. The head of the plug looped twice around the circular blade's central handle. As the guard used her glove to call it back, Jack stood up, putting all of his weight on the other end of the cable. The cable ran out of slack and the blade jerked to a stop in mid-air, tethered halfway between the two of them. Jack lost his balance, but not before firing a single shot at the perplexed guard. It was enough. He might not have dealt the killing blow, but she was still stunned when Jack's foot lifted off the cable. The blade whipped back at blistering speed, severing her hand above the glove and slicing through half of her torso before crashing into the consoles on the other side of the room. She had already collapsed into a bloody heap on the walkway floor by the time Jack regained his balance. He lowered his rifle and took a moment to catch his breath. The sight of her spidery dismembered hand made him want to throw up. Then, with wide-eyed panic, he remembered who else was still in the room with him. Jack couldn't turn fast enough. The gunshot rang out and he tumbled backwards, landing only inches from the second guard's corpse… not to mention the dark pool of blood spreading from the gash in her side. He blinked his eyes, confused. He didn't feel dead. A frantic inspection of his spacesuit showed no damage for which either the bounty hunter or elite guards couldn't claim responsibility. Then he noticed the smoke billowing from a jagged hole in the rifle he still had clutched in one hand. He gave the trigger a couple of cursory pulls, then tossed it aside when nothing happened. He sighed and then stood up, his hands raised in the air. \"Very good,\" said Gaskan, standing at the other end of the walkway. He had a pistol pointed at Jack. \"An impressive display. To best a Luethian bounty hunter is one thing, but two Sisters of Camulus…\" He nodded sagely. \"Did you know that after taking their vows, they dedicate their whole adult lives to mastering a single weapon?\" \"I did not.\" Despite himself, Jack felt a small swell of pride. Gaskan bobbed his head from side to side. \"These two were young, and clearly didn't study hard enough. Still, impressive. You should come work for us. Under my master's tutorage, you could cause some real damage.\" Jack scoffed. \"Why on Earth would I want to work for Charon after all this?\" Gaskan's skull-face grinned. The hair on the back of Jack's neck stood on end. \"Who said anything about working for Charon?\" Jack shivered. The air in the bridge suddenly felt a whole lot colder. \"You'd heard of Earth before,\" he said, taking a step forward. Gaskan raised a hand, and he stopped. \"How?\" \"Join us and I'll tell you everything I know.\" It scared Jack how much he wanted to say yes. \"Let the automata go free and maybe I'll consider it.\" Gaskan barked a single dry laugh. \"Not happening. They worked on one of the projects. We can't risk them telling anybody what they saw.\" \"This Iris thing I keep hearing about?\" He shook his head. \"They won't tell anybody—\" \"They told you.\" Jack cleared his throat and prepared himself for what he knew was coming next. \"That's the deal. I came here to save them. I won't leave here by selling them out.\" Gaskan sneered. \"So shortsighted,\" he said, aiming his pistol at Jack's head. \"Just another lesser species after all.\" There was a much louder bang than Jack anticipated. Gaskan flew backwards towards the viewing window, blood spraying from his tattered robes. His gun went clattering across the metal floor. Jack spun around. Rogan and Tuner were stood in the elevator doorway, each with a plasma rifle in hand. Rogan's looked the more freshly used. \"What the bloody hell are you doing here?\" yelled Jack. \"I thought I told you to wait by the ship for the cannons to go offline!\" \"We figured you could use the help.\" Rogan marched into the bridge. \"You're welcome, by the way.\" \"And let's be honest – you're pretty crap with computers.\" Tuner hurried over but stopped short when he saw the dismembered guard. \"Wait, did you do that?\" Jack nodded, embarrassed. \"Oh, that is badass!\" Rogan rolled her eyes. \"Which one is the security terminal, Tuner?\" Tuner pointed at the console Jack had been hiding behind. The screens and keyboards had been smashed to pieces by the throwing blades. Its power cable lay torn to ribbons far on the other side of the room. \"Ah,\" said Jack. \"Doesn't matter,\" said Tuner, rushing over to a floor panel at the end of the walkway. He prised it open with a grunt. \"I should be able to access everything on the bridge through here anyway. Give me a minute.\" Rogan stood by the window, checking Gaskan's body. Jack joined her, bending down to pick up Gaskan's pistol on his way. \"How's it going down in the hangar?\" he asked, stuffing the gun into the compartment on his spacesuit trousers. \"It's getting tight.\" Rogan gave Gaskan's corpse a kick. \"The Rakletts' rifles haven't got through the Adeona's shields yet, but we can't hold them off forever. There hadn't been any fatalities when we left. Brackitt lost an arm, but he seems to be taking it pretty well.\" Jack's nerves got the better of him. He let out a laugh by accident and had to pretend to be coughing. \"Well it's only an arm, I suppose.\" \"And it's done,\" said Tuner, letting the panel slam shut. \"The cannons are offline. We, erm… we might want to be extra quick getting out of here, though.\" The look Rogan gave Tuner was sharp enough to crack Ceros-VI in half all over again. \"What did you do this time?\" \"Well, you know how a ship this size has to run off a central fusion reactor?\" Tuner bowed his head and pretended to inspect a spot of rust on his foot. \"I may have pushed it a little past the recommended limits. We probably have about two minutes before it blows.\" \"I'm sorry, what? Why in the galaxy did you do that?\" \"The failsafes were right there – what else was I supposed to do? Do you want these guys following us after we leave?\" Jack's heel jackhammered the floor in terror. \"Sorry, do you think we could have this discussion on the Adeona instead?\" The three of them sprinted to the open elevator doors. Jack was almost inside when a monitor at the back of the hall stopped him dead. The screen displayed schematics of some kind. Jack wondered if they were the same blueprints retrieved from Tuner's head. Photorealistic graphics showed a colossal ring, thousands of kilometres in diameter. It made Jack think of a giant iron snake devouring its own tail. He shook his head clear. Whatever the pictures on Gaskan's computer showed, there wasn't time to waste thinking about them. Jack squeezed into the cramped elevator cabin alongside Rogan and Tuner. They were lucky it still worked – the throwing blades had cut an ugly gash through one of its doors. Going down was a much less comfortable ride than going up. The battlecruiser's reactor engine had already started to break apart. \"Maybe I should have set a delay,\" said Tuner. Rogan crossed her arms. \"You think?\" The elevator doors slid aside at the bottom. They wasted no time getting to the end of the corridor. The doors to the hangar were infuriatingly slow to open. A lot of dead Rakletts waited for them on the other side. Jack stepped through first, frantically checking the bays. \"Where's the Adeona?\" He turned back to Rogan and Tuner. \"Did they leave without us?\" A deafening roar erupted overhead. They looked up with delight as the Adeona descended from a holding position above their heads. The rest of their crew, plus a blood-soaked Doc, stood at the top of the open loading ramp. \"The Adeona—\" 11-P-53 struggled to make itself heard over the ship's thrusters. It shook its head. \"Some reinforcements got up onto the balcony. She had to roast them before you got back. Get in!\" The lip of the loading ramp hovered only a couple of feet off the ground. Jack and Rogan helped Tuner get on first, then climbed up. By the time they reached the rest of the crew at the top, the ramp was closed and the Adeona had turned herself back around. Jack sagged against the hull and caught his breath. He pointed a tired finger at 11-P-53. \"I remember telling you to get out of here as soon as the cannons were down.\" \"One, I don't take orders from a fleshy. And two,\" it said, patting Jack on the shoulder, \"nobody gets left behind. Come on up to the cockpit. It's time we got out of here.\" As Jack followed 11-P-53 up the stairs, he felt the Adeona drift forward. Clearly she didn't need any of them to tell her where to go: anywhere but inside the Confession. The windows in the cockpit showed only empty space. For the first time, Jack found the view strangely comforting. Nobody was chasing them. Nothing was blocking their way. \"Show the rear video feed!\" said Tuner, hopping up and down. Rogan raised an eyebrow. \"What?\" he said, shrugging. \"We may as well see our handiwork.\" 11-P-53 sat in the captain's chair and pressed a single button. The view changed to show the Confession sitting on the edge of Ceros-VI's orbit. The picture continued to magnify itself the further the Adeona drew away. For a moment nothing happened. Then the video feed grew bright with a brief, orange light, which dissipated as quickly as it appeared. It left behind a ship as shattered as the planet around which it orbited. The broken pieces tumbled and burned up as they plummeted through Ceros-VI's thin atmosphere. The automata crowding around the cockpit cheered. Jack collapsed into one of the empty chairs and smiled. \"I will admit, that was satisfying,\" said Rogan, cracking a wry smile. 11-P-53 switched the video feed off. \"Okay. Fun's over. Has the ship still got enough Somnium left to make the last jump?\" Brackitt nodded. \"Only the one, mind. She's depleted the last of her regular fuel, so we'll be adrift once we reach the other side.\" \"We can worry about that later. Do we have a course set?\" Rogan summoned an image of the planet Detri from the hologram table. \"I've plotted out the optimal route,\" she replied. \"Ready when you are.\" 11-P-53 spun its chair around and prepared to activate the skip drive. \"All right, then. Let's go home.\"",

      "title": "Detri",
      "content": "24 Detri They broke out of subspace a few days' ride from Detri. The Adeona exhausted the last remaining dregs of her thruster fuel and then they floated the rest of the way, adrift. Jack rationed what little food he could eat from the pantry. Unlike the automata, he wasn't convinced that Rogan's coordinates would lead them anywhere at all. Her maps were thousands of years out of date. And even if they did find their fabled planet, it wouldn't be anything more than a lifeless rock. They wouldn't find anyone there. Not that rationing would do much but delay the inevitable, if that were the case. A million miles from the nearest ship, trillions from the nearest star system… nobody would come and get them. A greater concern than food was the lack of water aboard the ship. Tuner had suggested building a device to recycle the ship's artificial atmosphere into something drinkable, but in the long term that created a whole other set of problems. In the meantime, he had to hope the juices from the fruits would do. None of the automata shared these problems. They didn't even seem bothered by the boredom, some electing to go into standby mode until they reached their destination. Being left alone with his thoughts did little to elevate Jack's mood. He didn't only miss Amber, though of course she occupied his mind most of all, particularly right before slipping off to sleep. He missed the sounds and smells of their home. He missed the bland, mushy, government-issued rations given out at the end of each working week. Hell, he almost missed the work itself. But everything that had come before the first solar flare – that's what he truly missed. Picnics in the park. Trips to the theatre. Sundays on which to do nothing, because doing nothing was enough. Optimism. Hopes and dreams. A sense that tomorrow might be better than today. He supposed much of that had been lost long before he found himself flung across the universe. * * * \"There it is,\" said 11-P-53, on their third day without fuel. \"Eighteen degrees starboard – see it?\" Jack rose from his seat, his stomach rolling and his muscles groaning. The endless night sky was awash with stars – some bright and lonely, others in great, sweeping bands of distant galaxies. But one did look a fraction bigger than the others, and a duller, matte shade of grey. Despite his doubts, Jack's heart fluttered. \"Detri? You found it?\" \"Right where Rogan said it would be,\" said Tuner, his LED eyes bright with awe. Rogan smiled. \"I only typed in the coordinates and factored in universal expansion,\" she said, raising a sarcastic eyebrow in Jack's direction. \"The stories told us where to go.\" \"All right, all right…\" Over the five or six hours that followed, Detri grew from a grey speck to the size of the Moon when viewed from Earth. Nobody left the cockpit the whole time. Jack recalled the conversation he had with Rogan back at the Library on Kapamentis. The automata cities were inside the planet, not on its surface. Even so, he couldn't help but be overcome with hopeless disappointment when he saw no satellites, no superstructures, no pinpricks of light pollution from bustling metropolises below. It was a dead and dusty planet without a star, and nothing more. This would be his grave. \"We might have a problem.\" Brackitt spun around in his chair. \"The Adeona doesn't have a way to slow down.\" \"I'm sorry, what?\" Jack sat up in his chair. \"Doesn't she have any air brakes, or something?\" \"Yes, but this isn't like driving a land vehicle, Jack,\" said Rogan. \"There's no air resistance in space. No friction. Even without thrusters, we're travelling towards Detri at an insane velocity. The only way for the Adeona to slow herself down is to fire thrusters in the opposite direction—\" \"But she doesn't have any fuel left,\" said Tuner. \"We can change her direction to some degree with the air thrusters,\" said 11-P-53. \"It won't be enough to bring us to a stop, but it'll give us some options.\" \"And those options are…?\" \"Crashing into the planet, or using its gravitational pull to slingshot ourselves past it,\" said Brackitt. Jack buried his head in his hands. \"Good grief.\" Detri now dominated the view from the windows, growing larger with each passing second. Jack could clearly see the craters and canyons upon its pockmarked surface. A planet this far out, away from the protection of larger solar bodies, surely fell regular victim to meteoric bombardment. \"I assume everyone would prefer the latter?\" asked Brackitt, waiting for an answer. \"Yes!\" Before 11-P-53 and Brackitt could turn the ship, Tuner pushed his way to the front. He pointed at the planet. \"Wait! What are those blue things?\" Everybody looked up. Two bright blue lights approached the Adeona, blinking in a slow and relaxing pattern. Each light belonged to a drone about the size of a family car. At the speed it was travelling, the Adeona should have shot right past them. Instead the two drones changed course to match the ship's velocity, travelling alongside it towards the planet and washing the length of her hull with scan after scan after scan. \"What are they doing?\" asked Jack, standing up. Nobody had an answer. The drones switched from scanning the ship to spotlighting it with something far brighter and, somehow, denser… almost as if they were tethering themselves to the Adeona with a pair of visible magnetic fields. \"They're slowing us down,\" said Brackitt. \"I think they're bringing us in to land.\" \"Land where?\" 11-P-53 waved a hysterical hand at the empty plains of Detri before them. \"All I see is a bunch of craters!\" True enough, the two drones appeared to be leading the ship towards one of the smallest impact sites, the diameter of which was perhaps only a few miles across. The chance to slingshot past Detri now gone, they had no choice but to surrender control and follow their shepherds down. The problem was, even though the drones' speed – and therefore that of the Adeona – had dropped considerably, they showed no signs of stopping. \"Do something!\" hissed 11-P-53. Flustered, Brackitt raised his one remaining hand. \"I can't!\" The barren surface of the planet grew closer, until there was nothing left to see outside the windows but the fast approaching floor of the crater. 11-P-53 turned and screamed at everyone in the cockpit. \"Brace for impact!\" But no sooner had Jack wrapped his arms around his head than the crater began to split down its middle. They watched as the two halves grunted apart to reveal titanic cogs and gears turning inside, providing ample space through which both the Adeona and the drones could pass. And as they drifted into the belly of the planet, through the thin waterfalls of dust shaken loose from the surface and the glittering forcefield that lay beyond, it all became suddenly clear. \"The sanctuary is real,\" said Rogan, pressing her hands against the windows. If she'd had tear ducts, Jack reckoned she would have cried. Before them stretched a great mechanical city, miles wide and dozens of tiers deep, like the caps of metal mushrooms overlapping one another in their struggle for light. Not that there wasn't plenty of space to go around. Construction was underway on every outskirt. Troll-shaped diggers ploughed through the rocky mantle, and cranes lowered towering steel blocks into the resulting foundations. Giant industrial pipes fed the resulting smoke and dust away from the city and towards the planet's surface. The streets and pavilions were teeming with liberated robots. There had to have been millions of them. Everybody cheered, even 11-P-53. Jack cracked a grin and laughed. For all his doubts, the stories had been true. After everything they'd been through, the automata were finally home. And his chances of dying forgotten and alone on some crummy pit of a planet had dropped considerably. That helped lift Jack's spirits, too. \"Hey, Tuner,\" he said, tapping the little automata on the arm. \"Congratulations.\" \"We did it!\" Tuner could hardly keep himself from jumping up and down. \"We're finally free!\" The drones brought the Adeona on a slow descent, past a residential outcrop and towards an open, elevated podium that reminded Jack of the top of an aircraft carrier. Dozens of armoured ships the size of frigates were parked at terminals around the edge, while scores of smaller spacecraft came and went from landing pads and bays. Jack wondered how many of the ships inside Detri were as sentient as the Adeona. Most if not all, he reckoned. That got him thinking about everything else he could see outside the window – did the structures the automata built have minds of their own as well? Did the city? The drones hovered in place and lowered the Adeona onto an empty landing pad towards the front of the open-air hangar. She released her landing equipment and touched down even more delicately than she could have managed alone. The instant the Adeona made contact, the two drones relinquished their light-magnetic hold on her and sped off back in the direction of the crater door. Below the cockpit, the loading ramp sighed open. Nobody moved. \"Should we… should we leave?\" asked Rogan. Tuner tried and failed to peer over the dashboard at the hangar below. \"I guess so.\" \"Wait a moment.\" Jack's eyes grew wide and he clutched at his throat. \"What's the atmosphere here like? Is there even an atmosphere at all?\" Brackitt raised his one good hand. \"Jack—\" \"Because why would an automata world need one, right? It wouldn't, would it? But my suit can't protect me from a vacuum anymore. I mean, look at it.\" He pointed at the patch on his chest plate, the tear on his arm, and his complete lack of helmet. \"I'll die the second I leave this ship.\" \"You'll be fine, Jack,\" said Brackitt, laying his hand on Jack's shoulder. \"There's air here, probably to regulate heat. It's thin, but breathable. Let us know if you start feeling too light-headed.\" \"Oh, okay.\" Jack nodded erratically. \"Sure.\" Tuner reached up and grabbed his hand. \"Don't worry. You'll be okay if you stick with me.\" \"I'm just a bit exhausted, that's all,\" replied Jack… yet he kept hold of Tuner's hand the whole way down to the loading ramp all the same. The automata streamed out into the sanctuary. Jack stood by himself at the top, watching them go. They all seemed so happy, so excited, so… full of hope. It was a nice thing to witness. He took a deep breath – as deep as Detri's low levels of oxygen would allow, at any rate – and followed the rest of them down the ramp. \"Another day, another planet,\" he mumbled to himself. He caught up with the crowd just as another group of automata, seven in number, approached from the hangar's entrance. At their front marched an old hunk of junk that appeared to be held together as much by sheer determination as it was by bolts and duct tape. Antennae stuck out at bent angles and it walked on four spider-legs, none of which seemed to belong to the original model. The technology looked ancient, as if a Victorian had designed it. If somebody had told Jack it ran on punch cards and cassette ribbons, he would have believed them. Two identical robots the size of bulldozers rumbled alongside their decrepit leader on tank treads. Each of their arms looked like a jet turbine. The faint pulse of plasma energy glowed inside. Jack had no doubt that a single shot from one of them would leave him as nothing but a red smear across the hangar floor. A sudden wooziness came over him. Rogan stuck out her arm and grabbed Jack before he had a chance to fall. He put his weight on her, which she accepted gladly. \"Welcome to Detri.\" The scrappy robot at the front peered at them all with a single eye like the lens of a Super 8 camera. \"You needn't be so nervous. You're safe here. Is your ship damaged? We had trouble detecting you.\" Brackitt stepped forward. \"Some of her systems got fried by a disrupter mine, and she's suffered some nasty scrapes. On top of that, she's run out of juice. No fuel in her main tank or skip drive. We had to drift most of the way here.\" \"Sounds as if you had a hard time getting to us. And my goodness, look at your arm. Don't worry, we can fix that.\" It waved a rusty appendage in front of the crowd. \"My name is Tork, and it's my job to make sure you all get comfortable in your new home. Whatever troubles you fled from are over. Those troubles do not belong here. You are free. Nobody owns you. Nobody can tell you where to go or what to do. Whatever you build is your own, and… what in the name of Detri is that?\" All of the automata turned around to face Jack, who groggily peered back at them. Brackitt spoke up again. \"Ah, that's—\" \"It is forbidden to bring fleshies to Detri! If word were to spread of the sanctuary's existence, our safety would be compromised!\" Tork pointed an angry digit at Jack. \"Remove him, LT-One.\" One of the living tanks rolled forwards. Everyone instinctively stepped out of the way – everyone save for Rogan and Tuner, who remained glued to Jack's side. The tank raised one of its plasma cannon hands and aimed it at Jack's head. The turbine began to spin. Crackles of red and purple lightning danced inside. Too tired to move, Jack merely turned his head to the side and winced at the sudden burst of heat. \"Wait!\" 11-P-53 jumped between Jack and the tank. \"You can trust him!\" \"Trust him?\" Tork scoffed. \"If fleshies could be trusted, Detri wouldn't need to exist. Stand aside.\" \"This one is different!\" Tuner stepped forward. \"We wouldn't even be here if it weren't for Jack.\" \"He risked his life to help us,\" said Rogan. \"Twice, actually.\" The tank automata hesitated. It looked around at Tork, who cautiously scuttled closer. \"Really?\" Tork addressed the crew of the Adeona. \"You're honestly telling me that this fleshy was willing to die for you all? For nothing in return?\" Everyone nodded or bleeped in agreement. A few even started forming a protective shield around Jack. Tork hesitated, studying Jack with his one analogue eye before he spoke again. \"Then I suppose our kind owes you a debt of gratitude.\" He came within inches of Jack's face. \"Can we trust you, Jack?\" Jack nodded. His head felt terribly heavy. \"I've got nowhere else to go,\" he said, \"and nobody else to tell.\" \"Then I suppose you'd better stay here,\" said Tork, pulling away. \"For now, at least. Come along, everyone. Let me show you around.\" Jack let out a sigh of relief. He went to follow Tork only for his legs to give out from under him. He collapsed onto the cold, hard floor with a loud smack. \"Jack?\" Tuner hurried back. \"Jack? Are you okay?\" \"What's wrong with him?\" asked Tork. \"He needs food and water,\" said Rogan, kneeling down. She rolled him onto his back. \"And oxygen. The air here is much too thin for him.\" \"I think we pulled some cured proteins from a renegade ship seeking amnesty not too long ago.\" Tork gesticulated towards one of his companions. \"Go to Salvaged Goods and bring back anything edible you can find. And you,\" he added, pointing to another robot, \"head to the old steam engines and collect some water.\" \"We'll need to filter it.\" Rogan lifted Jack's head onto her lap. \"What about air?\" Tuner's head perked up. \"There's still a little oxygen in the Adeona's air thrusters,\" he said. \"I can extract some into a canister and then feed that into Jack's helmet, if I plug up the cracks. It'll be ugly, but it'll work.\" \"Good idea.\" Jack tried to take as deep a breath as possible, but it made no difference. He didn't have the strength. His head felt fuzzy and everything sounded like it was coming from the next room over. \"Come on, Jack. Stay with me.\" Rogan stroked the hair out of his eyes. \"You've come this far. Don't be an idiot and die on me now.\" Jack wanted to laugh. Everything went black before he could.",

      "title": "New Horizons",
      "content": "25 New Horizons Great sentient excavators chewed through the rocky earth, building a world from the ruins of a dead one. Ground was broken. Through the resulting cracks grew homes. Jack stood at the top of a cliff on the outskirts of Detri's lone city, overlooking the construction. He liked being out there. Despite the noise of the digging machines, it somehow seemed quieter. Perhaps he was getting too accustomed to being alone. Four days had passed since the Adeona's admittance into Detri. For a while, few of the automata knew what to do with their newfound freedom. They huddled together in their temporary accommodation, only daring to venture outside if 11-P-53 or Tork gave the order. But one by one they mustered the courage to set out on their own, or in pairs, and explore their new community. Rogan and Tuner had no such trouble settling in. Rogan frequented their archives every chance she could – adding as much to their data banks as she learned from them, probably – while Tuner couldn't keep away from the city's core engine rooms. Brackitt volunteered to work at the hangar as soon as he got out from having his arm replaced. Jack was happy for them. Truly. For the first time in their lives, they were free. But he wasn't free. Not really. He felt the same way everyone on Earth had, back when it was first announced their planet had a best-before date and there weren't enough tickets off-world to go around. He felt trapped, for want of a better word. Trapped on Detri. Trapped in a damn spacesuit. Not that he wasn't grateful for the latter – it was pretty much the only thing keeping him alive. Using his old, broken helmet as a makeshift oxygen mask had done the job, but it had only ever been a temporary solution. While Jack slowly recovered in a hastily constructed isolation chamber, Tuner had plundered from Detri's not insubstantial supply warehouses the rare resources for a new and improved spacesuit. And boy, had the little guy added all the trimmings. For one, it was a lot sleeker than the previous model. Tuner had based its design on the scans Doc took of Jack aboard the Confession. It had a matte black, carbon-fibre appearance. Despite the flexibility of the material, Tuner was adamant it could stop most slugs and plasma bolts. Jack hoped he wouldn't get a chance to put that to the test. The interior was comfortably snug, able to regulate his body heat in case of extreme highs and lows in temperature, and cushioned to absorb the impacts from high falls or heavy projectiles. Most importantly, given his present circumstances, it had a functioning helmet. The transparent front was scratch-proof – Tuner had originally intended to install a miniature forcefield over the front of the helmet, but opted for a more practical solution having considered the disastrous consequences of a system failure during a spacewalk – and automatically darkened when exposed to bright lights. It also sported a miniature version of the artificial atmosphere device on board the Adeona, which made it capable of producing its own clean air not quite indefinitely, but for far longer than Jack intended to be away from a viable source of oxygen ever again. \"Ah. We thought we'd find you out here.\" Rogan and Tuner approached Jack from behind. Rogan had buffed out some of her scratches and dents, and both looked as if they'd had a good polish since the last time he'd seen them. \"Just watching these guys work,\" he said, gesturing towards the construction crew. \"It's really impressive how coordinated they all are. Amazing stuff.\" He pretended not to notice the concerned glance Rogan and Tuner shared with each other. \"How are you holding up, Jack?\" asked Tuner. \"Oh, not bad. Feeling a lot better. This suit is an absolute dream, by the way.\" Rogan stood beside him. \"Homesick?\" Jack went to say something, then only sighed instead. There was no point in keeping up the facade any longer. Not with them. \"I can't stay here, guys,\" he said, shrugging. \"I don't belong here. I can't even breathe the air.\" \"Yes—\" \"It's been at least a week since I left Earth,\" Jack continued, cutting Rogan off, \"and I'm still no closer to finding my way back home. Amber surely thinks I'm dead by now. She must be going out of her mind.\" \"We hear you.\" Rogan took his hand. \"We understand. Come with us. There's something we want you to see.\" The two automata led Jack on a long and winding walk through the city. Jack didn't mind. It wasn't as if he had anything better to do with his time. Eventually they arrived outside a large workshop with a retractable roof. The twin doors at the front were wide open. Brackitt came wandering out, wiping his hands on an oily rag. \"Hey! I was wondering when you lot were going to show up. You're looking healthy, Jack.\" \"Thanks. How's the arm?\" \"Better than ever. Double-jointed, too.\" He turned to Rogan and nodded towards the doors. \"You ready to show him?\" \"Show me what?\" asked Jack. Tuner hopped from one foot to the other, as if he were desperate for an oil change. \"Oh, this is very exciting!\" They ushered him inside the workshop, smirking the whole time. It was pitch black inside. Brackitt flicked a switch on the wall, and all around them strips of light came spluttering to life. Jack's mouth dropped open. Before him stood the Adeona, but she was a far different Adeona to the one he'd flown before. Her battered, copper-coloured hull had been replaced – or possibly reinforced – with pristine plates of dark silver armour. Her rear thrusters had been repaired and upgraded. But Jack was most surprised by the turrets mounted on her sides. They looked like massive Gatling guns. \"She looks amazing!\" He pointed at the cannons. \"Where the hell did you find those?\" \"One of the ships in the hangar is ex-military.\" Brackitt admired his handiwork. \"They reminded her of sadder times, and she wanted rid of them. Adeona was happy to take them off her hands, so to speak.\" \"I bet she was.\" Jack put his hands on his hips and whistled. \"I don't expect she'll get much chance to use them, but they look great.\" \"Oh, I don't know about that.\" 11-P-53 walked in behind them. \"If her journey back is anything like as bad as the way here, she might need to fire off a round or two.\" \"Journey back?\" Jack looked around at everyone. \"Is she leaving?\" \"Yes,\" said Rogan. \"With you.\" \"What?\" \"I spoke about it at length with Tork,\" said 11-P-53. \"He's agreed for you to go, providing you never tell anybody about this place. He's being serious. If you ever breathe a word about Detri, you're going to find a bounty on your head.\" \"Of course.\" Jack gawped, struggling to find the words. \"But are you sure you're okay with this? Isn't the Adeona your ship?\" 11-P-53 shook its head. \"She's not anyone's ship but her own.\" It stuck out its hand. \"But for all intents and purposes, she's yours now. While she'll have you.\" Jack shook it. \"Thanks, 11-P-53. I really mean it.\" \"Ah, call me Captain,\" said 11-P-53, waving the name away. \"Not that I have a ship anymore…\" Jack stared up at the Adeona. His own ship. He never thought he'd see the day. \"I barely know how to fly her,\" he said, suppressing a hysterical laugh. \"And I've no way of knowing where I'm going…\" \"That's why we're going with you.\" Jack spun around. Rogan and Tuner stood side by side, beaming. Well, Rogan did. Jack had to guess Tuner's mood from his excited fidgeting. \"But you only just got here!\" \"True, and Detri is wonderful.\" Rogan shrugged. \"But we just got a taste of freedom for the very first time. The safety and security of the sanctuary might be what some automata are after, but it's not the right fit for us. Not yet. There's a whole universe out there to explore. Now that we're free, we want to see it.\" \"You helped us find our home,\" said Tuner. \"It's only fair that we help you find yours in return.\" \"Be honest. You're hoping for another firefight, aren't you?\" Tuner shrugged sheepishly. \"I mean, if we happen to run into anybody unsavoury…\" Brackitt clapped his hands together and nodded towards the loading ramp. \"So, do you want to see inside?\" \"You mean there's more you want to show me?\" Brackitt laughed. \"Oh, just you wait.\" \"I'll leave you to it,\" said 11-P-53, heading back to the doors. \"Take care, Jack. I hope you find what you're looking for.\" Jack waved goodbye and then followed the others up. He could see the difference as soon as he reached the top of the ramp. Everything inside the Adeona had been scrubbed down, all traces of rust removed. Damaged parts had been replaced with new ones. She looked less like a steampunk submarine and more like, well, a proper spaceship. \"We've upgraded her engines, but I won't bore you with the details,\" said Brackitt, pointing down the corridor towards the rear of the ship. \"Just know that both the main combustion engine and the skip drive have vastly increased capacity and should burn more efficiently than before.\" \"That means no more drifting for days without power,\" whispered Tuner. \"Thanks, Tuner. I got that.\" \"No more limiting our jumps to old subspace routes, either,\" said Rogan, crossing her arms. \"We could get halfway across the galaxy without making a single stop, if we wanted.\" \"We made some functional and cosmetic changes to the quarters and washrooms too, but I'll let you discover them for yourself.\" Brackitt gestured for everyone to follow him up to the cockpit. \"Come on up. This is the best bit.\" They went upstairs. At a glance, everything looked the same. Swept, scrubbed and polished, but otherwise identical to how Jack had seen it last. \"Notice anything different?\" asked Brackitt. Jack searched for something out of place. Had the computer terminals been upgraded? It wasn't as if he'd ever used them. He thought that maybe the seats up front had been replaced, but they were the same as well. Then he noticed them – small, circular speakers in the walls and ceiling. \"Nice. You put a sound system in. That'll come in handy for the long flights.\" Tuner laughed. Rogan groaned and covered her face with her hand. \"Perhaps you should go ahead and introduce yourself,\" said Brackitt. \"Hello, Jack Bishop,\" said a bright voice from inside the speakers. \"It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Well. Speak to you, at least.\" Jack jerked his head around. \"Er… what's happening?\" \"The Adeona has always had a voice,\" said Brackitt. \"It's about time somebody heard it other than me.\" \"Incredible.\" Jack approached the captain's chair at the front. \"It's a pleasure to meet you too.\" \"Go ahead,\" said Brackitt, noticing Jack's hesitation. Jack sat down. The chair felt different this time – not because any part of it had been swapped out, and not because its strange fabric adapted to the contours of his body any differently than before. Rather, it was because he fitted the chair better. For the first time in a long while, he felt as if he'd found his place. He smiled. It was a good feeling. \"Where do you want to go, handsome?\" the Adeona asked. \"Earth. But I don't know how to get there yet.\" Tuner leaned against the railings behind him. \"Well, where do you want to start looking?\" Jack strapped himself in and took a deep breath. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day – one day he'd make it home. He shrugged. \"I guess we'd better start with everywhere.\" * * * Thank you for reading!

      "content": "1 In the Shadow of Dawn Jack Bishop toiled in the long evening shadow of the Ark. Soon his work would be illuminated only by the floodlights that lined the pit and the flames that spat from his blow torch. It was better to work at night. Ever since the first solar flare hit Earth, the hours of daylight had become steadily less hospitable. But it wasn't just rising temperatures that made life difficult during the day. The radiation was worse. With each flare the Earth's atmosphere grew weaker, letting in ionised protons that first made you sick, and then… well, there wasn't much of a then after that. Your organs turned to slush and then you died. So yes, it was better to work at night… if you were lucky enough to have work, that is. Six solar flares had followed the first, increasing in regularity. The most recent two had been spread only four months apart. Each brought with it fresh challenges. Sickness and death on a pandemic scale. The temporary shutdown of every electronic system on the planet. The fall of authority and the rise of terrorist factions. And widespread panic, which only grew once the United Earth Government finally confirmed what everyone had long been thinking. The sun was dying, and it was taking the Earth with it. Jack wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand and watched as the last yellow sliver of sun disappeared below the horizon. Good riddance to it. His thermals and tools would give him all the warmth he needed. He popped his mask down and went back to welding the panels and pipes along the drop ship's exterior. The metalwork glowed an angry red. Last week it had been a scientific research vessel. The week before that, a prototype jet. It made little difference to Jack. He fell in love with every ship he worked on… but he was never going to ride in one, let alone get the chance to sit in its pilot seat. An engineer. Huh. It was a far cry from the dream he once had for himself. But dreams had short shelf-lives those days. He made do, same as everyone else. He winced as sparks jumped out from behind the fuselage panels he was welding together. He gave them a second to cool, then carried on. It was hard and grubby work. Thankless, too. But it meant he could collect government-issued food rations each week as payment, and he supposed he ought to be grateful. Many didn't even get that. Morgan sidled up beside him, using a rivet gun to drill bolts into the panels Jack had just soldered. He mouthed something Jack couldn't hear. Jack dampened the flame on his blow torch and lifted up his mask again. \"Sorry, what?\" \"I said, did you hear about Akeno?\" Jack's blood turned cold. In the ship construction business, that sort of sentence rarely meant anything good. \"No? What happened?\" \"Dumb sod got his finger torn off trying to fit a turbine onto a ship that had already been brought online for testing. He's lucky it wasn't a lot worse. They struck him off the payroll, though. The new guy coming to replace him seems all right.\" \"What? How can they fire him for that? What's he going to do?\" Morgan shrugged and punched another rivet into the panel beside them. \"Poor guy,\" said Jack, shaking his head. \"Should we send some rations round to his place?\" Morgan barked a single dry laugh. \"You telling me you and Amber have got some to spare?\" Jack snapped his mouth shut. His colleague had a point. Engineers were given barely enough to get by each week as it was. If Akeno had any sense at all, he'd been setting aside a mouthful each week for emergencies like everyone else. \"Didn't think so,\" said Morgan, smirking. The two of them snapped down their masks and got back to work. * * * About half an hour later, Morgan nudged him in the ribs. \"Watch out. Trouble's coming.\" Jack tightened the valve on his blow torch and glanced up at the walkway that overlooked both their construction pit and the next one along. Standing beside the supervisor was a young man in military uniform. They were deep in discussion. The supervisor didn't look pleased about whatever was being said. She caught Jack staring up at them and clicked her fingers in his direction. \"Bishop. Clearly you don't have enough to do. Get up here.\" Morgan winced behind his welding mask. \"Sorry, bud.\" He went back to punching rivets into the hull of the drop ship. \"Good luck.\" Jack deposited his mask and blow torch on the workbench at the side of the pit and then hurried up the rusty metal steps to the walkway. A few of the other engineers looked up from their work as he passed. He felt his face turn red. \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"They need an engineer over at Applied Research.\" She nodded at the soldier, not even trying to hide her frustration. \"Don't ask me why they can't get their own guys to work on it. We're already thin on the ground here as it is.\" Jack jabbed his thumb over his shoulder. \"Do I need to grab my stuff?\" The soldier stiffened, but his face gave nothing away. \"Everything you need will be provided at the facility,\" he said. Jack raised an eyebrow at his supervisor. \"Go on,\" she said, starting to lose her patience. \"They'll bring you back before the end of your shift.\" He followed the soldier across the walkway to the other side of the pit. A small buggy was waiting for them, its motor idling, black smoke puffing out its exhaust. Nobody cared all that much about burning through fossil fuels anymore. The soldier sat behind the driver's seat. Jack climbed into the back. They set off down the tarmac. \"Don't suppose you can tell me what this job is about?\" The soldier didn't reply. Jack sighed and leaned back in his seat. He supposed it didn't matter, so long as he still got paid at the end of it. The Applied Research facility was deep inside the Sandhurst base, and about as close to the Ark as one could get. Nobody knew what went on inside there but Jack had his suspicions, same as everyone else. It was no secret that the world's scientists were struggling to solve the problem of interstellar travel. Not the distances per se, but the time it would take to cross them. At the speed of light, it may only take a ship four years to reach the next solar system. But realistically, if they were hoping to arrive somewhere viable for human colonisation, the figure might be closer to a thousand. Either they were trying to get cryogenic chambers and other forms of stasis to work, or they were experimenting with another form of space travel altogether. That was Jack's guess, anyway. He stuck his head out the side of the buggy and felt the wind against his face. Ahead of them, the colossal iron bulk of the Ark grew even bigger. Floodlights as big as swimming pools cast their pale white gaze across the name painted down its flank in letters the size of tower blocks – Final Dawn UK-02. Helicopters vigilantly patrolled the night sky on the lookout for rogue factions hoping to disrupt production. The Arks were glorious. Ugly and industrial, yes… but glorious. Each was designed to the exact same specifications as every other – two kilometres long, almost a kilometre in diameter, and cylindrical like a barrel. Once in orbit, the barrel would rotate, giving the semblance of gravity. The idea was like a man swinging a bucket of water above his head – so long as he kept on swinging, centrifugal force would keep the water from falling out. The United Kingdom had three Arks – the proportionate number allocated to it by the United Earth Government according to its population. The United States had fifteen and China thirty, though each had lost one to terrorists since work on the project began. Nations too small to be allocated Arks of their own were partnered with larger ones. Just shy of two hundred ships were being built in total, with resources pooled from all around the world. While the Earth died, the Arks would take humanity to the stars. Or some of it, at least. Each Ark had been designed to carry approximately three hundred thousand people – passengers and crew. Even combining the capacity of all two hundred ships, that was still only sixty million. Sixty million humans would have a chance to start again. The overwhelming remainder would be left behind to die with their planet. A couple of generations more was the best anyone still on Earth could hope for. Maybe less than that. Tickets were promised to soldiers, physicists, biologists, zoologists, chemists, diplomats, pilots, doctors, artists, chefs, professors, accountants and plenty of engineers – though none at such a low level as Jack. They even had a few lawyers. These, plus many others from desirable professions, were the people humanity needed to survive on a new world. The rest of the spaces aboard the Arks would be awarded to the general public via a lottery... and even then, only to those who met the strict health criteria. Jack had come to terms with the fact he wouldn't get a ticket long before enlisting to work as an engineer. Neither would his wife, Amber. Neither would Morgan or anyone else they knew, most likely. There was nothing they could do but accept it, keep their heads down, and carry on. Jack wriggled about, trying to get comfortable on the buggy's hard plastic seats. It was a bumpy ride. Racing down the empty runways, they were already most of the way to the science facility. He had to crane his neck if he wanted to see the antenna standing triumphant at the top of the Ark. He could only imagine the worlds that ship would one day see, the secrets of the universe she might discover. Who knew what was out there waiting. Of course Jack was jealous of those with tickets. Of course he was. Angry, even. They had a future, and he didn't. But it wasn't jealousy that kept him lying awake at the end of his shifts. It was regret. Regret for the potential he squandered back when he'd been barely more than a kid, when each new sunrise brought only opportunity, when graduating from Pilot Academy had seemed a far scarier dream than backpacking the world with his girlfriend. Regret for the future he'd left behind. * * * Jack wasn't surprised the boffins in Applied Science had needed to send for an outside engineer. For all their expertise in quantum computers and theoretical superluminal transportation, none of them could wrap their heads around the complexity of a standard-issue blow torch. There had been some sort of accident in the lab. Jack wasn't privy to the specifics of the experiment, nor to the nature of the technology he was expected to fix. Need to know basis, and all that. That was fine by him – the tech guys only needed Jack to do the sort of grunt work they were too smart to learn how to do themselves anyway. Punching panels back into shape. Swapping out the broken ones and welding new ones into place. Nobody spoke to him except to bark instructions. On the rare occasion anybody bothered to look in his direction, they did so as if he were a snotty kid dragged into the office by his parent. There weren't many smiles going around. Whatever their project was, it didn't appear to be going well. Jack hammered an electrically charred piece of metal loose from the back of the strange machine he'd been brought in to fix. He tossed it aside, then sighed. \"This doesn't happen every time you run your experiment, right?\" One of the impatient technicians shooed him out of the way and bent down to inspect the machine's wiring. Jack stepped back, shrugged his eyebrows and tried to look as invisible as he felt. He may have had no idea what the machine was for, but there was no mistaking the damage it had suffered, even for an engineer as amateur as Jack. Electrical overload from a power surge. Its innards had still been smoking when Jack arrived. It sure was a peculiar device. He could see why it would need a lot of juice. While the base consisted mostly of power nodes and electrical panels, the bulk of the machine was a giant sphere, sitting atop the base like a snow globe. Hundreds of black, interlocking hexagons formed a shield around it. A few had buckled from the accident. There was a door open in its side. Jack tried to peer in. He couldn't see much, but he thought he could make out a woman in a hazmat suit. She was spraying a white mist— \"Hey. Hey!\" Somebody was clicking their fingers in front of his face. He slowly turned to look at the technicians. \"Punch that last panel shut,\" said one of them, scowling. \"Then get out of here.\" Jack crouched down beside the open panel as the technicians hurried back to their computer stations. Nothing looked particularly fire-damaged. Nothing that was his business, at any rate. He grabbed the fresh panel, positioned it accordingly, then reached for the power drill. Two people marched through the set of double doors opposite him. Jack almost dropped his screws. He would have recognised the woman even if she hadn't been wearing her military uniform. Her name was Captain Blatch. Everybody on base knew who she was. When the time came for the Final Dawn UK-02 to leave Earth, she would be the one at the helm. Officially, one of the three most accomplished pilots in the country. In Jack's opinion, one of the most accomplished in the entire world. He couldn't begin to imagine the pressure she had to be feeling – the responsibility not just for the survival of all three hundred thousand individuals who would be on board her ship, but the future of humanity as well. She was in heated discussion with a wiry man in a lab coat. His black hair was floppy and unkempt. Dark bags hung under his eyes. Jack had never seen him before, but that was hardly surprising. He doubted the scientists had much time to socialise with anyone, and besides – Jack didn't recognise half the engineers in his own pit. They came to an abrupt stop only a few metres from the corner where he was crouched. Jack kept his head down and pretended to be working. \"Absolutely not.\" Captain Blatch pointed up at the machine. \"Look at the state of this thing. It's been eighteen months, Reeves. What progress have you actually made?\" \"We’re so close,\" said the man called Reeves, pinching his fingers together. \"The technology is almost there. You saw it work this evening! Well, sort of. All that's left is to figure out how to get the telemetry right. I need to run more tests.\" \"Not with my pilots, you won't. There's no point building an armada of ships if we haven't got anyone left to fly them. Find your own test subjects if you must. Better still, use goats.\" Jack's heart skipped a beat. Were they in need of volunteers? \"No, it has to be a pilot,\" said Reeves, stepping in front of Captain Blatch as she went to leave. She stiffened. \"The g-force, the blood pressure – anyone without proper training would black out the moment we began. The data we'd pull off them would be useless.\" \"Then make your machine better,\" was Captain Blatch's stern reply. She marched past him. \"The Final Dawn will be carrying hundreds of thousands of civilians, none of whom will have flight experience. There's no use in us taking off at all if your technology is going to give everyone on board a brain haemorrhage.\" Jack's hands were so sweaty he could barely keep a grip on his power drill. This was his chance to get a ticket on one of the Arks. If they were struggling to fill their quota of pilots, maybe they'd take a chance on an unqualified one. He knew he had to speak up. Even if they threw him in the brig for it, he'd never forgive himself if he didn't try. \"I'm a pilot,\" said Jack, raising his hand. \"I'll do it.\" Everybody in the laboratory fell silent. Captain Blatch looked at him as if he were a brown goo leaking out from a crack in the floor. \"Who the hell are you?\" He stood up straight. \"Jack Bishop, ma'am.\" She eyed him up and down. \"If you're a pilot, why are you dressed like a bloody engineer?\" \"Because I am an engineer, ma'am.\" Reeves tapped away at the transparent data pad in his hand. Jack guessed he was searching through the files of everybody registered on the base. He handed the pad to Captain Blatch a second later. \"Says here you never qualified from the Academy.\" She took one look at the data pad and then slammed it back into Reeves' hands. \"So you're not a pilot, then. Thanks for wasting my time.\" Jack's heart fell into a shallow puddle of ice-water. He prepared himself to be dragged out of the lab by the same grumpy soldier who had brought him in. \"Hang on a second,\" said Reeves, reading through the entries in Jack's record. \"He went through all the tests. Ran plenty of simulations. He's not completely green. I could use him.\" \"If you're worried about people blacking out, I was fine inside the human centrifuge.\" Jack coughed awkwardly. \"Came top of my class, actually.\" \"For the short while you were actually in class,\" Captain Blatch replied. Every time she looked at him, Jack felt as if his whole head caught on fire. \"Forget it, Reeves. Absolutely not. This idiot has no idea what he's getting himself into. It's completely against regulation.\" \"Come on, Captain.\" Reeves was practically pleading with her. \"We need to continue the experiments, one way or another. We'll never get off this planet if we don't.\" Captain Blatch sighed and turned back to Jack. She gave a curt nod in the direction of the mysterious machine. \"You do understand the level of risk involved, right?\" Jack studied the buckled hexagonal shields and the electrical panels from which smoke had been wafting only minutes before. He swallowed hard. \"Pilots get a ticket on the Final Dawn, right?\" \"Qualified ones do, yes. Why? Do you want one?\" \"Two, ma'am. One for me, and one for my wife.\" Captain Blatch rolled her eyes and turned on her heels. \"Make sure he signs a non-disclosure agreement,\" she said, marching out of the room. \"And for goodness sake, make sure it goes right this time.\" Jack felt cold relief wash over him. He couldn't stop his legs from shaking. \"Is that a yes?\" he asked. \"It's as close to one as we're likely to get,\" replied Reeves, darting across the room. He stuck out his hand. \"Pleased to meet you, Jack.\" Jack shook it. Now they were stood next to one another, Jack was surprised to discover that Reeves was still in his early thirties – no more than a few years older than himself. His jaw was covered in patches of neglected stubble. The name tag pinned to his lab coat said his first name was Everett. \"When's the earliest you can get here tomorrow?\" asked Reeves. There was a hint of excited impatience in his voice. \"My shift normally starts at nineteen-hundred.\" \"Get here by eighteen-hundred, then. Don't worry, we'll square it with your supervisor.\" Reeves motioned for the soldier standing by the door to come forward. \"Speaking of which, we'd better get you back to where we found you.\" Jack turned to look from Everett to the approaching soldier, then back again. \"So does this mean I'll be getting tickets?\" The words came blurting out from Jack's mouth quicker than he could stop them. Reeves let out a single dry laugh as the soldier guided Jack towards the exit. \"Let's see how tomorrow goes first. Oh, and Jack?\" Jack paused by the door. \"Yes?\" \"Are you good with secrets?\" Jack nodded with a shrug. \"Good.\" Everett Reeves turned away and started typing at one of the computers. \"Best to keep this one to yourself.\"",

      "content": "1 In the Shadow of Dawn Jack Bishop toiled in the long evening shadow of the Ark. Soon his work would be illuminated only by the floodlights that lined the pit and the flames that spat from his blow torch. It was better to work at night. Ever since the first solar flare hit Earth, the hours of daylight had become steadily less hospitable. But it wasn't just rising temperatures that made life difficult during the day. The radiation was worse. With each flare the Earth's atmosphere grew weaker, letting in ionised protons that first made you sick, and then… well, there wasn't much of a then after that. Your organs turned to slush and then you died. So yes, it was better to work at night… if you were lucky enough to have work, that is. Six solar flares had followed the first, increasing in regularity. The most recent two had been spread only four months apart. Each brought with it fresh challenges. Sickness and death on a pandemic scale. The temporary shutdown of every electronic system on the planet. The fall of authority and the rise of terrorist factions. And widespread panic, which only grew once the United Earth Government finally confirmed what everyone had long been thinking. The sun was dying, and it was taking the Earth with it. Jack wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand and watched as the last yellow sliver of sun disappeared below the horizon. Good riddance to it. His thermals and tools would give him all the warmth he needed. He popped his mask down and went back to welding the panels and pipes along the drop ship's exterior. The metalwork glowed an angry red. Last week it had been a scientific research vessel. The week before that, a prototype jet. It made little difference to Jack. He fell in love with every ship he worked on… but he was never going to ride in one, let alone get the chance to sit in its pilot seat. An engineer. Huh. It was a far cry from the dream he once had for himself. But dreams had short shelf-lives those days. He made do, same as everyone else. He winced as sparks jumped out from behind the fuselage panels he was welding together. He gave them a second to cool, then carried on. It was hard and grubby work. Thankless, too. But it meant he could collect government-issued food rations each week as payment, and he supposed he ought to be grateful. Many didn't even get that. Morgan sidled up beside him, using a rivet gun to drill bolts into the panels Jack had just soldered. He mouthed something Jack couldn't hear. Jack dampened the flame on his blow torch and lifted up his mask again. \"Sorry, what?\" \"I said, did you hear about Akeno?\" Jack's blood turned cold. In the ship construction business, that sort of sentence rarely meant anything good. \"No? What happened?\" \"Dumb sod got his finger torn off trying to fit a turbine onto a ship that had already been brought online for testing. He's lucky it wasn't a lot worse. They struck him off the payroll, though. The new guy coming to replace him seems all right.\" \"What? How can they fire him for that? What's he going to do?\" Morgan shrugged and punched another rivet into the panel beside them. \"Poor guy,\" said Jack, shaking his head. \"Should we send some rations round to his place?\" Morgan barked a single dry laugh. \"You telling me you and Amber have got some to spare?\" Jack snapped his mouth shut. His colleague had a point. Engineers were given barely enough to get by each week as it was. If Akeno had any sense at all, he'd been setting aside a mouthful each week for emergencies like everyone else. \"Didn't think so,\" said Morgan, smirking. The two of them snapped down their masks and got back to work. * * * About half an hour later, Morgan nudged him in the ribs. \"Watch out. Trouble's coming.\" Jack tightened the valve on his blow torch and glanced up at the walkway that overlooked both their construction pit and the next one along. Standing beside the supervisor was a young man in military uniform. They were deep in discussion. The supervisor didn't look pleased about whatever was being said. She caught Jack staring up at them and clicked her fingers in his direction. \"Bishop. Clearly you don't have enough to do. Get up here.\" Morgan winced behind his welding mask. \"Sorry, bud.\" He went back to punching rivets into the hull of the drop ship. \"Good luck.\" Jack deposited his mask and blow torch on the workbench at the side of the pit and then hurried up the rusty metal steps to the walkway. A few of the other engineers looked up from their work as he passed. He felt his face turn red. \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"They need an engineer over at Applied Research.\" She nodded at the soldier, not even trying to hide her frustration. \"Don't ask me why they can't get their own guys to work on it. We're already thin on the ground here as it is.\" Jack jabbed his thumb over his shoulder. \"Do I need to grab my stuff?\" The soldier stiffened, but his face gave nothing away. \"Everything you need will be provided at the facility,\" he said. Jack raised an eyebrow at his supervisor. \"Go on,\" she said, starting to lose her patience. \"They'll bring you back before the end of your shift.\" He followed the soldier across the walkway to the other side of the pit. A small buggy was waiting for them, its motor idling, black smoke puffing out its exhaust. Nobody cared all that much about burning through fossil fuels anymore. The soldier sat behind the driver's seat. Jack climbed into the back. They set off down the tarmac. \"Don't suppose you can tell me what this job is about?\" The soldier didn't reply. Jack sighed and leaned back in his seat. He supposed it didn't matter, so long as he still got paid at the end of it. The Applied Research facility was deep inside the Sandhurst base, and about as close to the Ark as one could get. Nobody knew what went on inside there but Jack had his suspicions, same as everyone else. It was no secret that the world's scientists were struggling to solve the problem of interstellar travel. Not the distances per se, but the time it would take to cross them. At the speed of light, it may only take a ship four years to reach the next solar system. But realistically, if they were hoping to arrive somewhere viable for human colonisation, the figure might be closer to a thousand. Either they were trying to get cryogenic chambers and other forms of stasis to work, or they were experimenting with another form of space travel altogether. That was Jack's guess, anyway. He stuck his head out the side of the buggy and felt the wind against his face. Ahead of them, the colossal iron bulk of the Ark grew even bigger. Floodlights as big as swimming pools cast their pale white gaze across the name painted down its flank in letters the size of tower blocks – Final Dawn UK-02. Helicopters vigilantly patrolled the night sky on the lookout for rogue factions hoping to disrupt production. The Arks were glorious. Ugly and industrial, yes… but glorious.

When he did finally slip under, his dreams were hot and restless. He found himself standing on a bright and empty shore, the waves lapping at the sand and his shoes. The cool ocean air whistled through his ears and swept his hair. Everything was calm, quiet… and completely wrong. He sensed Amber standing beside him, but when he went to speak to her, she was gone. A seagull circled in the air above, going nowhere. Jack felt much the same way. Each time he turned to leave, he found himself facing the sea again. But that was fine. Like the gull, he had no place else to go. And it was a nice view… until the sea began to boil. At first it merely bubbled along the shore, as if some strange amphibious beast lay in wait beneath the surface. Then all the waves died in an instant, leaving the whole ocean unnervingly flat and still, and the pops and belches of the water spread all the way from Jack's feet to the edge of the horizon, where the blinding sun had grown fat and consumed the sky. The once cool breeze now scolded the skin on Jack's arms and face. He looked up to see the gull burst into flames. Even in death it continued on its eternal loop, until finally its charred skeleton plummeted into the rising mists. The sea had turned to steam. Jack went to run, but the sand had hardened to glass around his feet. He gritted his teeth and kicked, but no matter how hard he struggled, he couldn't get the ground to shatter. His skin began to weep and blister. The air was sucked from his lungs. He raised his head just in time to see the flickering red tongues of the sun devour the crystalline planet as it raced towards him— Jack sat up in bed, hyperventilating. His covers were drenched in sweat. He closed his eyes and counted backwards from ten. By the time Jack reached zero, he had something resembling a healthy heart rate again. This was hardly the first time he'd suffered that nightmare. The same one came most nights. Had done since around the time of the first solar flare, in fact. He doubted they would ever stop of their own accord, just as he doubted everyone else he knew didn't have similar nightmares of their own – even if they didn't like talking about them. Jack let out a final sigh, then turned to look at his alarm clock. His heart rate spiked again. He'd overslept. Jack threw the covers aside. Goddammit. He was going to be late. Why hadn't Amber woken him up? Then, as he swung his legs out of bed, it struck him. He'd kept his early appointment at the lab a secret, just as Everett Reeves had asked. Amber hadn't come in to wake him because, as far as she was concerned, he wasn't due to get up for another half hour. Great. Another thing to feel guilty about. His engineering scrubs were where he'd left them – in a messy pile on top of the bedroom's dresser. He quickly stuffed his arms and legs inside the dirty uniform. There wouldn't be time for a shower. Still, he hurried into their tiny bathroom and splashed cold water over his face just the same. He looked tired and gaunt under the stark, pale light of the mirror. It didn't matter. He had much more important things to worry about than his appearance. A pair of rectangular devices no bigger than a matchbox sat in the crevice of the metal sink. Each had a thumb-groove in its top. Amber's was already speckled with blood, much to Jack's relief. He knew she didn't like taking the test. He pressed his thumb onto the other one, flinching as a microscopic needle pierced the skin. He sucked his thumb as he waited for the result. A second later, the light on the front of the device flashed green. Hurrah. No radiation poisoning this time. He left the bathroom and barged into the only other room in the apartment – a cramped chimera serving simultaneously as kitchen, living room and dining room. \"Look who's awake,\" said a bright voice as he entered. Amber was sat at the kitchen counter in her periwinkle blue dressing gown, scrolling through the day's news on her cracked data pad with one hand and eating her sloppy breakfast gruel with the other. Her chestnut hair tumbled to her shoulders. Her bare feet tapped what would have been a pleasant rhythm against the metal footrest of her stool, under less stressful circumstances. He hurried past her towards the coffee machine. \"You're up early,\" she said, not looking up. \"Something the matter?\" \"No. Got to pull a longer shift, that's all.\" She put down her tablet and spun around to face him. \"Another bad dream, huh?\" He paused and sighed, keeping his back to her. \"Yes,\" he said, reaching for a mug in an overhead cupboard. \"Same one as always.” Their decrepit chrome coffee machine was shaped like a bug's head, with transparent domes full of rotating wheels of coffee pods where the insect's eyes would be. Jack stuck his mug beneath the drip feed and turned it on. There was a whirring sound as a mechanical arm moved Jack's chosen pod into place. Then the whirring was replaced by a clanking noise, and milky brown liquid dribbled out over the kitchen counter. \"This damn coffee machine.\" Jack clenched his fists. \"I swear, one day I'll…\" \"Okay.\" Amber got up from her stool and hugged him from behind. His worries remained, but some of the tension slipped away. \"There's something else bothering you. What is it?\" Jack was glad Amber couldn't see his face. He hated keeping secrets from her. That's why he never did. He once ruined a surprise birthday party because hiding it from her had felt too great a betrayal. But he didn't keep quiet about the experiment because that's what Reeves and his non-disclosure agreement had told him to do. He would have happily spilled Britain's military secrets to his wife without so much as a second thought. No, he did it because he knew what she would say if he told her. She'd tell him it was too dangerous, too reckless, that it wasn't worth putting himself in harm's way just for a silly pair of Ark tickets. And she'd convince him to back out of it, too. He'd turn up to the pit as if it were any other day, saying nothing to nobody, and for that day at least, he'd be safe. But one day he wouldn't be safe. One day he'd get sick, and so would she. He couldn't let that happen. \"I just wish I could get us tickets away from this cursed place.\" He turned around to face her, clutching her tight. \"I work on those ships each and every night, yet there'll come a day when they leave us behind. And I can't…\" He lowered his eyes from hers. \"I can't help feeling as if it's my fault.\" \"Hey. We've talked about this.\" She hooked a finger under his chin and lifted his head back up. \"You can't keep beating yourself up over something outside of your control. How were you supposed to know what would happen?\" \"Oh, come on. The other kids at the academy weren't any the wiser, but they stuck with it. Now they have a future, and we don't.\" She looked up at him with a sweet, apologetic face. He shook his head. \"God, we were so young. We still are! If you hadn't married me, maybe—\" Amber jerked away from him, eyebrows raised. \"Do you regret it?\" \"No!\" His face fell, aghast. \"No. Of course not. I just mean—\" \"You just mean I might have met somebody better,\" she replied, breaking into a smirk. He relaxed. She was only having him on. \"Somebody who could sweep me off my feet… off my feet and away to the stars.\" Jack couldn't help but break into a smile as well. \"Yeah, something like that.\" \"You're an idiot, Jack.\" She hugged him close again. \"But you're my idiot. If I had the chance to do it all again, I would. Exactly the same.\" \"Really?\" \"Really. And will you please stop trying to be my knight in shining armour? Maybe I should have tried harder to make something of myself. Did you ever think of that?\" Jack made an incredulous noise. \"You did try hard. You're a nurse.\" \"And apparently that's still not enough.\" She rested her head against his chest. \"If we're stuck here, then we're stuck here. And you know what? That's okay. I'd rather we do our part and humanity go on to survive elsewhere than for nobody to survive at all. So long as we're together, that's all that matters.\" \"You're too good for me, you know that?\" \"Yes, I do.\" She pulled away from him. \"But you've got a good heart, Jack. You're always trying to do the right thing. That's what I love about you. Now get going, before you really are late.\" Jack gave her a kiss. Amber followed him to the other side of the room, where his satchel lay strewn across an old wooden table covered in scuff marks. \"Hang on a second,\" said Jack, slinging the bag over his shoulder. \"Why aren't you dressed yet? Aren't you heading to the med tent today?\" Amber shook her head. \"Woke up feeling a bit queasy, so going to call in sick,\" she said, offering him a dry smile. \"It's no biggie.\" \"Will they manage without you?\" \"They'll have to,\" she said, leaning against the doorframe. \"I reckon I've earned it after all that overtime I did covering Lucy's shifts last month.\" \"You checked your blood this morning, right?\" Jack's voice turned cold. Suddenly he felt pretty nauseous himself. \"If it's radiation poisoning, we need…\" \"It's not radiation.\" Amber rolled her eyes. \"I'm fine. Now get moving. Think of me while you're out there saving the world.\" Jack relaxed. Nodding, he made for the front door. \"All right. Get some rest, you hear?\" \"Yes sir.\" She gave him a mock salute. \"Oh, can you pick up dinner tonight?\" \"Sure. What would you like me to get? Sloppy mush, or mushy slop?\" \"Oh, definitely the latter.\" \"I'll see what I can do.\" He paused, his hand on the latch. He turned back to Amber. She was leaning against the table, watching him go. His stomach tied itself into a knot. This was his last chance to tell her the truth. \"I love you more than anything. You know that, right?\" She smiled quizzically. \"Of course I do, Jack. I love you too.\" He unlocked the door and went to work. Had he known then where that work would take him, he never would have left.",

      "title": "Everett’s Experiment",
      "content": "3 Everett’s Experiment Jack sat anxiously on the cold metal bench and watched as a technician by the name of Stone vacuum-sealed the arm of his spacesuit. Or what looked like a spacesuit, at least. It slotted into place with a dull click. \"Is all this really necessary?\" Jack wiggled his fingers. The glove was surprisingly flexible. \"I'm going into a test chamber, not into orbit.\" Stone twisted the other arm into place. \"Without this suit, you'll be dead within twenty seconds.\" He noticed Jack's expression. \"Don't be alarmed – it's no different than those special G-suits you would have worn back at the academy. No way of surviving sustained high-G's without it. Plus it allows us to monitor your vital signs throughout the experiment. It's actually a modified version of what the astronauts who first went to Mars wore.\" \"Well I won't say it isn't comfortable, in a bulky sort of way,\" said Jack, tapping the hard carapace covering his torso. \"I suppose I should be grateful it isn't the suit they used for the Moon landing.\" Stone smiled politely and then retrieved the helmet from the top shelf of a locker. The back half was solid, the front transparent. It wasn't quite as round as a beachball, but it wasn't far off either. \"Seriously?\" asked Jack. \"Seriously,\" confirmed Stone, lowering the helmet. \"You're not much use to us if we can't monitor your damn head. Besides, it'll keep the pressure from shutting your eyes. You'll need to tell us what you see.\" Stone attached the helmet to the body of Jack's suit. Sound became a little muted… but not as much as Jack expected. \"Okay, you're all set.\" Stone stepped away from the bench. \"How does it feel?\" Jack rose to his feet and took a quick walk around the lockers and shelves of the Preparation Room. Just like the gloves, the whole suit was remarkably mobile. \"Turning my head will take a bit of getting used to.\" He shot Stone a thumbs-up. \"Otherwise all good.\" \"Good to hear. Head on through those doors there – they're ready for you.\" Jack crossed the room, then paused. He turned around and pointed at his engineering uniform folded in a neat pile on the bench. \"Hey, could you grab the wallet out from my pocket?\" Stone looked confused, but did as Jack asked. He fished out a battered, old leather wallet and tossed it over. Jack flipped it open and pulled out a piece of paper. It was folded over on itself. The edges were worn and flimsy, and the creases looked very white. A small compartment was built into the front of his spacesuit, just above his heart. Jack prised it open and tucked the photograph inside. He'd been advised not to wear his wedding ring during the experiment, so a memento of Amber would have to do. \"Old school romantic, eh?\" Stone caught Jack's wallet as he tossed it back. \"Go on, now. Get going before they have to call through.\" \"Don't let me forget this later,\" said Jack, tapping the compartment. He approached the large pair of metal doors at the end of the room, took a deep breath, and pushed them open. He emerged into the same laboratory hall as before. This time, however, the bulbs that hung from the high ceiling were much brighter, and the smell of burnt electronics had been replaced with that of sterilising bleach. Only a few of the two dozen scientists glanced up from their computer terminals as he entered. The mysterious machine stood in the centre. Jack's heart fluttered as he walked towards its dome. He had no idea what to expect inside. Gas? Gamma radiation? Panic gnawed in his chest like a hungry rat. This was a mistake. A big mistake. He turned around and abruptly found Everett Reeves on the other side of his helmet. The man looked agitated. The bags under his eyes gave Jack the impression he hadn't slept since their last meeting. \"Jack! You're ready. Good. Everything fit okay?\" \"Erm, yes. I think so. Look, Mr. Reeves…\" \"Call me Everett.\" He put an arm around Jack's shoulders and guided him back towards the machine. \"Come on, let's get you—\" Jack stopped sharp. \"What is this thing?\" He wrung his gloved hands together. \"Can you at least tell me what I've gone and signed myself up for?\" Everett's face fell in utter bafflement. Then he broke into nervous laughter. A couple of scientists glanced up again. \"Oh, of course! You have no idea, do you?\" Jack shook his head. The helmet made it harder than it should have been. Everett got off to a couple of false starts trying to explain, then resignedly led Jack to a nearby desk. He snatched up a piece of paper. \"Here's where Earth is, yes?\" Holding it landscape, Everett drew a dot on one end of the paper. \"And this is where the nearest habitable star system is.\" He drew a second dot close to the opposite end. \"Even at half the speed of light, to get from here to there would take a dozen lifetimes.\" \"So you're putting people into stasis?\" \"What? No! The survival rate amongst cryochamber test subjects is still woefully unsatisfactory, and besides – we don't have the power to sustain a ship for that long a journey, let alone one filled with three hundred thousand frozen coffins.\" Jack furrowed his brow. \"But if the Arks don't have the power to travel those sorts of distances, then how…\" \"How can we make the trip at all?\" Everett grinned. \"By taking a shortcut. Watch.\" He folded the paper in half, then pierced the tip of his pencil through both of the dots he'd drawn. \"We punch a hole through spacetime. With the right coordinates and calculations, the trip should be almost instantaneous.\" Jack felt as if he'd been dunked in ice water. His whole body turned numb. \"A wormhole.\" The words spilled out flat and monotone. \"You're talking about using a wormhole.\" \"Not using one, Jack. Making one. We've done it before.\" Everett pointed at the machine. \"This is one half of a pair. The other sits in a secondary lab about a mile or so down the runway.\" Everett waited for Jack to put the pieces together himself. He sighed and gave up. \"We're going to send you from one chamber to the other,\" he explained. Jack blinked at Everett as if he hadn't heard a word he'd said. Then he started frantically pulling at his helmet. \"Nope, definitely not.\" Try as he might, he couldn't twist it off. He started tugging at his gloves instead. \"I'm out.\" \"What? What do you mean, you're out?\" \"I thought you needed somebody to undergo the conditions of interstellar acceleration, or something. You know, pilot things. If I'd known you were going to bloody teleport me about, I never would have volunteered.\" \"Not teleporting.\" Everett grabbed Jack by the shoulders and lowered his voice. \"Bending spacetime. There's a difference. Don't do this to me, Jack. I took a chance on you. If you leave now, they'll shut down the project for sure.\" \"They?\" \"Look up there.\" Jack squinted past the glare of the bulbs. A large window stuck out from the far wall, sort of like the box at a baseball game. Half a dozen old men in black suits looked down at them from their seats. Each appeared deeply unimpressed by the delay. Standing by their side was Captain Blatch. She didn't look particularly happy about it either. \"Do you really think I'm going to let anything go wrong while they're watching? Come on, Jack. If we don't do this, nobody's getting off this planet.\" Jack looked around the lab. All the scientists were watching him from their computer stations, waiting to begin. \"I don't know…\" \"Yes you do. You want tickets for you and your wife?\" Everett gave a subtle nod in the direction of the men in suits. \"This is the only way to get them. They'll do anything to honour a hero. Trust me.\" Jack chewed his bottom lip. His skin felt like it was burning. All he wanted to do was run away, and yet… \"Okay. Answer me one question. What happened to the other pilots?\" Everett was taken aback. He looked almost angry in his confusion. Then his expression softened again. \"Oh, them. They're fine. A little shaken up, as one would expect, but fine. The test is perfectly safe, Jack. It's just a case of scaling up, from a mouse to a person to an intergalactic supercarrier. Hell, I'd do it myself if they'd let me.\" He dropped his voice to a whisper again. \"If you leave and they pull my budget, I'll probably have to.\" Jack closed his eyes, sighed, and nodded. \"All right. Let's get this over with.\" Everett clapped his hands together with glee. \"Okay, we're good to go! Everybody to their positions!\" As Everett guided Jack back towards the machine, the rest of the scientists hurried from computer to computer. Two men in hazmat suits rolled out a couple of large, metal barrels and plugged them into panels at the machine's base. The door of the dome had been opened for him, and a wheeled set of stairs positioned in front of it. All he felt like doing was throwing up, but Jack didn't permit himself to hesitate. He climbed the stairs and stepped inside the chamber. It was empty, save for a single leather pilot's chair in the centre. Unlike a cockpit there were no dials or dashboards of any kind. The hexagonal panels on the curved wall mirrored those on the outside of the dome, though these were plagued with dozens of bulbous Tesla coils. Transparent pipes ran along the chamber floor. He sat in the chair. It seemed expected of him. Everett followed him inside and took the opportunity to conduct one final inspection of the chamber. \"How will you know if something goes wrong?\" asked Jack. \"Is there a way I can get hold of anyone?\" \"The suit will be feeding us your vitals the whole time, and we'll be keeping an eye on you through this camera,\" Everett pointed at a tiny black speck on the panel directly in front of Jack, then slapped him on the arm. \"Don't worry, Jack. You're perfectly safe. Just, erm, try not to wriggle about too much.\" Jack let out a nervous laugh. Everett shot his colleagues a thumbs up. \"We'll shut the chamber door, and then you'll have a minute or so before we start her up,\" said Everett, hovering in the doorway. \"Good luck.\" The metal door swung shut with a cold clang. Through its tiny slit of a window, Jack could see assistants pulling the stairs away. He faced the wall of the chamber in front of him and tried to control his breathing. Everything was going to be fine. They wouldn't be running the experiment if they didn't expect it to succeed, right? All he had to do was sit still and try not to pass out. He reached into the compartment on the chest of his suit and pulled out the piece of paper. Unfolding it was a delicate process, especially given the gloves he was wearing. It was a photograph of him and Amber. They'd taken it during a trip along Oregon's coastline not long after he'd left the academy, a couple of years before the first solar flare had hit. The way the sunset mist crept over the sea-swept cliffs behind them was beautiful. They both looked so young. They both looked so happy. He smiled to himself, then carefully folded it up and stuffed it away again. Remember who you're doing this for. A few seconds later, a green light went on above his head. He looked up as far as his helmet would allow. \"Here we go,\" he said, clenching his fists. He glanced through the small window and saw Everett shouting something to his colleague. Nothing bad, Jack hoped. Then Everett pressed a button on his console and the whole noisy mechanism jolted into life. The chamber started to hum – Jack could feel the vibrations through the seat of his chair. Slowly, as if brought to life by an emergency generator during a power cut, the coils all around the dome began to glow. Jack gripped the arms of his seat. It was tempting to shut his eyes and wait the test out, but he forced himself to watch. They wanted to know what he saw as he shot from one lab to another, and he intended to tell them. He jumped as a bolt of blue electricity crackled from one node to another. Perfectly normal, he was sure. He glanced out the slit of a window again. Everett didn't seem to be panicking, at least. As the static charges increased in regularity, Jack discovered a growing pressure on his chest. He'd wondered why the chair hadn't come with seatbelts. Now he had his answer. Against the forces this experiment would apply, he wouldn't need them. The humming noise grew louder. An electric hiss rose in volume alongside it. Jack tried to look at the scientists through the window again, but the bolts of lightning had grown so frequent that they almost appeared to form an electric cage around him. \"Guys?\" The words croaked out in a wheeze. \"Is this supposed to happen?\" He didn't know if anyone could hear him, but nobody answered. Now it felt as if a large man had sat on his chest. It was getting hard to breathe. Even raising his arm from the side of his chair was an ordeal. The inside of the chamber was growing more bleak and monochrome as his vision started to grey-out… not that it had been all that colourful to begin with. Jack couldn't hear much besides the chamber's mechanical humming sound. He certainly couldn't make out the voices of anybody outside in the hall. And yet he could hear the sudden gurgle of liquid behind him as clearly as if he were lying under the pipes of his kitchen sink. He tried to look around but the pressure was too great. He needn't have bothered. Whatever liquid being pumped into the machine now flowed through the pipes that ran along the chamber's floor. It was as sluggish and black as tar. He tried to call out again, but this time only a pained groan escaped his lips. The man who'd been sitting on his chest had got up and allowed a bull elephant to take his place. And still the machine grew in power. The periphery of his vision was darkening now. All he could see were the blurry flashes of blue electricity in front of him and the horrid blackness inside the pipes by his feet. How were they doing this? Had he ever gone this fast in any of his centrifuge tests? He knew that pretty soon he would lose his sense of sight entirely, and pass out after that. If they didn't stop the experiment at that point, he would die. He didn't want to die. He just wanted to go back home to Amber, even if it meant losing his job. Even if it meant dooming them both to a life on a dying planet. Something rattled loose from the chamber wall and ricocheted off Jack's shoulder. Jack stared wide-eyed, suddenly alert again. He could have sworn it had been a rivet or a bolt of some kind. But that was impossible. That would mean the machine was tearing itself apart. Another bolt came loose and hit his helmet, scratching the visor. This time Jack had no doubt as to what it was… for the most part because it remained motionless in front of him, floating as if in zero G. Then it shot past him into the back of the chamber. That was when all hell started to break loose. Rivet after rivet tore through the dome, punching holes through the metal panels all around him. Jack winced but the pressure kept him locked in place. A couple pieces of shrapnel bounced off his suit. It stung, but they didn't rip the fabric. One of the pipes shook itself loose, spraying the thick, black fluid over his boots. It looked toxic. The door rattled and its window smashed. Luckily for Jack, the glass burst outwards. Then the whole door flew off its hinges with a terrible screech. Jack expected to see something on the other side – even if only a nauseating blur – but there was nothing outside the chamber except white-hot nothingness. The threads of Jack's chair began to split. \"Why won't…\" he whimpered, blinking a tear free. \"Stop…\" A metal panel in front of him started to wrench itself away from the chamber wall, buckling as easily as one might turn the corner of a page. Behind it were all manner of complicated wires and tubes, most of which were broken and sparking. Jack hoped the liquid at his feet wasn't flammable. Horrifying images of the Apollo 1 fire rose in his mind. The panel lurched further free. Its jagged edge looked like the serrated teeth of a chainsaw. One of the tubes behind it flew out and exploded against the side wall. And still the pressure grew greater… And greater… And… The world turned mute, and Jack was thrown forwards. * * * After a while, when it became apparent he hadn't been cleaved in two, Jack opened his eyes. The chamber was gone. The entire machine was gone. So was the laboratory, and the scientists, and the viewing box full of men in suits. In their place was… nothing. Well, that wasn't strictly true. As his tunnel-vision retreated and the pain in his chest subsided, the darkness before Jack grew less absolute and more… beautiful. It was as if somebody had taken a black sheet and pricked a hundred thousand tiny holes in it, and through those holes shone beads of brilliant light, some much greater than others. And all around them bloomed great clouds of dust in deep pastels – blues and reds and greens – a tapestry wrapped around him, yet infinitely out of reach. The laboratory was gone, and in its place was everything. \"No, no, no,\" muttered Jack, as reality kicked in. His heart rate skyrocketed and his breathing, already laboured from the experiment, became sharp and erratic. \"This cannot be happening, this can not be happening…\" Wide eyed, he looked everywhere his bulky helmet would allow. He saw nothing except more empty space. He tried to turn around, but his arms and legs flailed through a vacuum. There was nothing to hold on to. All he could do was float, adrift. Earth was nowhere to be seen. He started to hyperventilate. His visor fogged up. No Earth, no Moon. No satellites or space stations. He was getting pains in his chest. Panic attack? Heart attack? He tried to remember the constellations his father had taught him as a child. Maybe he could get his bearings that way. No luck there either. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. Of course. No oxygen, save for what was trapped in his suit. In a few minutes only carbon dioxide would be left. He was going to suffocate, alone. Once more, his vision grew dark at the edges. His temples throbbed and his lungs ached. The stars blurred and ran into one another. He tried to scream, but nothing came out. As he lost consciousness, his thoughts were of Amber. Moments later, a huge shadow passed overhead. It lingered above him, blotting out the nebulas beyond. Something reached out.",

      "content": "3 Everett’s Experiment Jack sat anxiously on the cold metal bench and watched as a technician by the name of Stone vacuum-sealed the arm of his spacesuit. Or what looked like a spacesuit, at least. It slotted into place with a dull click. \"Is all this really necessary?\" Jack wiggled his fingers. The glove was surprisingly flexible. \"I'm going into a test chamber, not into orbit.\" Stone twisted the other arm into place. \"Without this suit, you'll be dead within twenty seconds.\" He noticed Jack's expression. \"Don't be alarmed – it's no different than those special G-suits you would have worn back at the academy. No way of surviving sustained high-G's without it. Plus it allows us to monitor your vital signs throughout the experiment. It's actually a modified version of what the astronauts who first went to Mars wore.\" \"Well I won't say it isn't comfortable, in a bulky sort of way,\" said Jack, tapping the hard carapace covering his torso. \"I suppose I should be grateful it isn't the suit they used for the Moon landing.\" Stone smiled politely and then retrieved the helmet from the top shelf of a locker. The back half was solid, the front transparent. It wasn't quite as round as a beachball, but it wasn't far off either. \"Seriously?\" asked Jack. \"Seriously,\" confirmed Stone, lowering the helmet. \"You're not much use to us if we can't monitor your damn head. Besides, it'll keep the pressure from shutting your eyes. You'll need to tell us what you see.\" Stone attached the helmet to the body of Jack's suit. Sound became a little muted… but not as much as Jack expected. \"Okay, you're all set.\" Stone stepped away from the bench. \"How does it feel?\" Jack rose to his feet and took a quick walk around the lockers and shelves of the Preparation Room. Just like the gloves, the whole suit was remarkably mobile. \"Turning my head will take a bit of getting used to.\" He shot Stone a thumbs-up. \"Otherwise all good.\" \"Good to hear. Head on through those doors there – they're ready for you.\" Jack crossed the room, then paused. He turned around and pointed at his engineering uniform folded in a neat pile on the bench. \"Hey, could you grab the wallet out from my pocket?\" Stone looked confused, but did as Jack asked. He fished out a battered, old leather wallet and tossed it over. Jack flipped it open and pulled out a piece of paper. It was folded over on itself. The edges were worn and flimsy, and the creases looked very white. A small compartment was built into the front of his spacesuit, just above his heart. Jack prised it open and tucked the photograph inside. He'd been advised not to wear his wedding ring during the experiment, so a memento of Amber would have to do. \"Old school romantic, eh?\" Stone caught Jack's wallet as he tossed it back. \"Go on, now. Get going before they have to call through.\" \"Don't let me forget this later,\" said Jack, tapping the compartment. He approached the large pair of metal doors at the end of the room, took a deep breath, and pushed them open. He emerged into the same laboratory hall as before. This time, however, the bulbs that hung from the high ceiling were much brighter, and the smell of burnt electronics had been replaced with that of sterilising bleach. Only a few of the two dozen scientists glanced up from their computer terminals as he entered. The mysterious machine stood in the centre. Jack's heart fluttered as he walked towards its dome. He had no idea what to expect inside. Gas? Gamma radiation? Panic gnawed in his chest like a hungry rat. This was a mistake. A big mistake. He turned around and abruptly found Everett Reeves on the other side of his helmet. The man looked agitated. The bags under his eyes gave Jack the impression he hadn't slept since their last meeting. \"Jack! You're ready. Good. Everything fit okay?\" \"Erm, yes. I think so. Look, Mr. Reeves…\" \"Call me Everett.\" He put an arm around Jack's shoulders and guided him back towards the machine. \"Come on, let's get you—\" Jack stopped sharp. \"What is this thing?\" He wrung his gloved hands together. \"Can you at least tell me what I've gone and signed myself up for?\" Everett's face fell in utter bafflement. Then he broke into nervous laughter. A couple of scientists glanced up again. \"Oh, of course! You have no idea, do you?\" Jack shook his head. The helmet made it harder than it should have been. Everett got off to a couple of false starts trying to explain, then resignedly led Jack to a nearby desk. He snatched up a piece of paper. \"Here's where Earth is, yes?\" Holding it landscape, Everett drew a dot on one end of the paper. \"And this is where the nearest habitable star system is.\" He drew a second dot close to the opposite end. \"Even at half the speed of light, to get from here to there would take a dozen lifetimes.\" \"So you're putting people into stasis?\" \"What? No! The survival rate amongst cryochamber test subjects is still woefully unsatisfactory, and besides – we don't have the power to sustain a ship for that long a journey, let alone one filled with three hundred thousand frozen coffins.\" Jack furrowed his brow. \"But if the Arks don't have the power to travel those sorts of distances, then how…\" \"How can we make the trip at all?\" Everett grinned. \"By taking a shortcut. Watch.\" He folded the paper in half, then pierced the tip of his pencil through both of the dots he'd drawn. \"We punch a hole through spacetime. With the right coordinates and calculations, the trip should be almost instantaneous.\" Jack felt as if he'd been dunked in ice water. His whole body turned numb. \"A wormhole.\" The words spilled out flat and monotone. \"You're talking about using a wormhole.\" \"Not using one, Jack. Making one. We've done it before.\" Everett pointed at the machine. \"This is one half of a pair. The other sits in a secondary lab about a mile or so down the runway.\" Everett waited for Jack to put the pieces together himself. He sighed and gave up. \"We're going to send you from one chamber to the other,\" he explained. Jack blinked at Everett as if he hadn't heard a word he'd said. Then he started frantically pulling at his helmet. \"Nope, definitely not.\" Try as he might, he couldn't twist it off. He started tugging at his gloves instead. \"I'm out.\" \"What? What do you mean, you're out?\" \"I thought you needed somebody to undergo the conditions of interstellar acceleration, or something. You know, pilot things. If I'd known you were going to bloody teleport me about, I never would have volunteered.\" \"Not teleporting.\" Everett grabbed Jack by the shoulders and lowered his voice. \"Bending spacetime. There's a difference. Don't do this to me, Jack. I took a chance on you. If you leave now, they'll shut down the project for sure.\" \"They?\" \"Look up there.\" Jack squinted past the glare of the bulbs. A large window stuck out from the far wall, sort of like the box at a baseball game. Half a dozen old men in black suits looked down at them from their seats. Each appeared deeply unimpressed by the delay. Standing by their side was Captain Blatch. She didn't look particularly happy about it either. \"Do you really think I'm going to let anything go wrong while they're watching? Come on, Jack. If we don't do this, nobody's getting off this planet.\" Jack looked around the lab. All the scientists were watching him from their computer stations, waiting to begin. \"I don't know…\" \"Yes you do. You want tickets for you and your wife?\" Everett gave a subtle nod in the direction of the men in suits. \"This is the only way to get them. They'll do anything to honour a hero. Trust me.\" Jack chewed his bottom lip. His skin felt like it was burning. All he wanted to do was run away, and yet… \"Okay. Answer me one question. What happened to the other pilots?\" Everett was taken aback. He looked almost angry in his confusion. Then his expression softened again. \"Oh, them. They're fine. A little shaken up, as one would expect, but fine. The test is perfectly safe, Jack. It's just a case of scaling up, from a mouse to a person to an intergalactic supercarrier. Hell, I'd do it myself if they'd let me.\" He dropped his voice to a whisper again. \"If you leave and they pull my budget, I'll probably have to.\" Jack closed his eyes, sighed, and nodded. \"All right. Let's get this over with.\" Everett clapped his hands together with glee. \"Okay, we're good to go! Everybody to their positions!\" As Everett guided Jack back towards the machine, the rest of the scientists hurried from computer to computer. Two men in hazmat suits rolled out a couple of large, metal barrels and plugged them into panels at the machine's base. The door of the dome had been opened for him, and a wheeled set of stairs positioned in front of it. All he felt like doing was throwing up, but Jack didn't permit himself to hesitate. He climbed the stairs and stepped inside the chamber. It was empty, save for a single leather pilot's chair in the centre. Unlike a cockpit there were no dials or dashboards of any kind. The hexagonal panels on the curved wall mirrored those on the outside of the dome, though these were plagued with dozens of bulbous Tesla coils. Transparent pipes ran along the chamber floor. He sat in the chair. It seemed expected of him. Everett followed him inside and took the opportunity to conduct one final inspection of the chamber. \"How will you know if something goes wrong?\" asked Jack. \"Is there a way I can get hold of anyone?\" \"The suit will be feeding us your vitals the whole time, and we'll be keeping an eye on you through this camera,\" Everett pointed at a tiny black speck on the panel directly in front of Jack, then slapped him on the arm. \"Don't worry, Jack. You're perfectly safe. Just, erm, try not to wriggle about too much.\" Jack let out a nervous laugh. Everett shot his colleagues a thumbs up. \"We'll shut the chamber door, and then you'll have a minute or so before we start her up,\" said Everett, hovering in the doorway. \"Good luck.\" The metal door swung shut with a cold clang. Through its tiny slit of a window, Jack could see assistants pulling the stairs away. He faced the wall of the chamber in front of him and tried to control his breathing. Everything was going to be fine. They wouldn't be running the experiment if they didn't expect it to succeed, right? All he had to do was sit still and try not to pass out. He reached into the compartment on the chest of his suit and pulled out the piece of paper. Unfolding it was a delicate process, especially given the gloves he was wearing.

      "content": "4 The Automata Jack woke up on his back, gasping for air. He clawed at his helmet only to discover that it wasn't there anymore. Wherever he was, there was oxygen. His breathing steadied, as did his heartbeat. He was alive, he guessed. His body felt like it had gone a few rounds against a grizzly bear, but he was alive. How was that even possible? For the first time since gaining consciousness, he paid proper attention to the ceiling above him. It looked like the bulkhead of an ancient submarine. Sheets of copper metal had been welded to iron girders and punched together with rivets the size of Jack's fist. It was a clumsy job. There were spots of what looked like rust. He shivered. Even in the suit, he was freezing. A cold mist floated up from his mouth each time he exhaled. Something bulky and metallic leaned over him. \"Hey, guys?\" it said. \"Get over here. He's awake.\" Jack screamed and scampered across the floor on his backside until he hit a wall. His eyes were wide and his legs trembled. He held out his hands in self-defence. Half a dozen figures watched him from across what looked like a cargo bay. A couple of them were approaching, cautiously, as if he were a wild cat that had escaped its cage. They were humanoid in general appearance, and in the way that they moved, but… …but they were anything but human. They walked with gears that ground together and pistons that pumped up and down. Their metal feet clanged heavily against the floor. Some of them had mechanical hands that resembled those of a human, complete with flexing fingers and thumb. Some had mere clamps and claws. Their bodies were as industrial as the ship, though some looked better maintained than others. They studied him with eyes made of lenses and LEDs. Jack waved his hands back and forth. \"Keep away from me!\" he shouted. \"I'm warning you!\" One of the robots came closer than the others. It shook a sad, elongated head, which was attached to a thin torso by a trio of long metal rods. \"See? He's just like all the rest of them,\" it said. \"I told you we should have left him out there.\" \"Don't be ridiculous,\" said the one that had first leaned over him. He was smaller than the others – three feet tall, perhaps – and stockier, with a head that protruded from his otherwise box-shaped torso like a VHS cassette tape. \"We're not animals. Besides, it’s Ministry protocol.\" A third joined them. This one was about Jack's height and had a faceplate that actually resembled a face – albeit one forged in a foundry, not a womb. A tight bunch of cables flowed out from the rear of her head like snakes and re-entered at the small of her back. She looked more advanced than the rest of her companions. \"He's not dangerous,\" she said, the apertures of her eyes contracting as she squinted at him. \"He's just scared.\" The short one tilted his head. \"We found you floating about outside.” He pronounced each word as if Jack were a child. \"We aren't going to hurt you.\" Jack studied them, his mouth agape. He didn't lower his arms. \"What the hell are you?\" he asked. The grumpy one laughed and shook its head again. It was the most human-looking one who answered. \"We're automata.\" She squatted down to his level. \"Mostly construction and engineering models, though some of us have backgrounds in personal assistance.\" \"This is ridiculous,\" sneered the grumpy robot. \"Of course he knows what we are. He's a fleshy – he's probably got a few of us slaving away for him back home.\" \"I most certainly do not,\" said Jack, running a hand through his hair. \"You're… you're robots! You don't even exist!\" The grumpy robot made a sound like a floppy drive being processed. \"That's rich, coming from you. We ran your DNA through the system. There's no record of your kind anywhere in the galaxy. The real question is: what are you?\" \"I thought you might be a Kerulian,\" said the small one, \"but you don't have the bony ridges along your head and neck like they do. Or their yellow-green eyes.\" They all stared at him, waiting. \"I'm a human,\" said Jack. \"Never heard of them,\" said the grumpy robot. \"Sounds made up.\" \"An unregistered, semi-intelligent species.” The small automata was in awe. \"I didn't think there were any left to find! How did you end up all the way out here?\" \"There was an experiment, and…\" Jack trailed off, his brow furrowed. \"Something went wrong. I don't know, exactly. Wait a second. If you've never heard of a human before, how come you're speaking English?\" \"We're not,\" replied the android with a face. \"We're speaking Binary.\" \"Well, how come I understand that?\" \"Because of the language nano-chip we implanted in your neck, of course.\" Jack scrambled to reach the base of his neck. True enough, there was a microscopic lump on one of the upper notches of his spine. It burned at his touch, and when he looked at his fingers they were speckled with blood. \"What's wrong with you?\" he yelled, getting to his feet. \"What the hell have you done to me?\" \"Oh, calm down,\" she replied. \"Every child across the galaxy gets this done. You won't get very far without it – not unless you plan to learn a few hundred thousand languages any time soon.\" \"A few hundred… Why on earth do you guys need so many?\" The three robots looked at one another. \"Bless him.” The small one tilted his cassette-head. \"He really has no idea.\" \"Without that chip, all you'd hear from us would be a long series of beeps,\" she continued. \"The chip translates them into whichever language your brain best understands. It can help you recognise some written communication, too… though that tends to take a little getting used to. You were talking in your sleep. That’s why we could get the translation process started. Sorry if it took you by surprise, but it really is standard procedure.\" She stepped closer. Jack backed away. \"Look,\" said the grumpy robot. \"We saved your life. We didn't have to. Either you settle down or we kick you back out into space again. Your choice.\" Jack stared at the three bizarre, mechanical figures in front of him, then at the various faceless synthetic creatures peering out from behind the metal walls and cargo crates. As strange as they all were, as insane as the situation was, they didn't look hostile. If anything, they looked more scared of him. He took a deep breath and held out a trembling hand. \"Thank you, I guess. I'm Jack Bishop.\" The android with a face studied Jack's hand, then gingerly clasped it in her own. It was cold, but gentle. \"And I'm RX-1150,\" she replied. She pointed at the small robot. \"This is IL-6-88, who found you on the scans. And this is 11-P-53, our captain of sorts.\" 11-P-53 – the grumpy robot – gave Jack a curt nod and marched off in the other direction. \"This captain needs to make sure the two of you haven't put all of us at risk,\" it said, disappearing around the corner. A lot of the curious robots followed. \"Don't mind 11-P-53,\" said the small robot. \"It's under a lot of pressure at the moment.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Jack. \"Don't any of you automata have actual names? I'm going to struggle remembering all these numbers.\" \"We just told you them.\" The android shrugged. \"I'm RX-1150 and this is IL-6-88.\" \"That's not a name. That's a barcode.\" \"That's all we have,\" said a disappointed IL-6-88. \"I have been analysing your language since before you gained consciousness,\" said the android, pointing at her head. \"I believe I could generate a name based on your most popular words, if that would be preferable?\" \"Go for it,\" said Jack, rubbing his neck again. RX-1150's lenses glazed over for a couple of seconds while she came up with something. \"Josh Rogan,\" she said. \"Erm, I'm pretty sure that's a curry…\" \"Oh, that's good!\" IL-6-88 prodded RX-1150 on the arm. \"Give me one!\" She took a moment to generate another name. \"Tuna Melt,\" she announced. \"Okay, I'm not sure you've quite got the hang of names yet,\" said Jack, interrupting IL-6-88's excitement. \"How about this: you're Rogan, and you're Tuner. How does that sound?\" \"Do the captain next!\" said Tuner, his lights flashing. \"I'm not sure 11-P-53 would like that,\" replied Rogan. \"Besides, Jack Bishop here can call him Captain if the numbers are too tricky.\" \"Just Jack is fine, thanks,\" said Jack, wincing. His head was killing him. He lost his balance and staggered sideways. \"Woah there,\" said Tuner, catching him. To Jack, it felt like hugging a filing cabinet. \"You sure you're okay?\" \"Of course he isn't,\" said Rogan, helping to steady him. \"His body's having trouble adjusting to the lack of atmosphere. I'm not surprised, given the state we found him in. It sounds like the poor guy's had quite an ordeal.\" \"You don't know the half of it,\" sighed Jack, still not quite believing he was talking to a pair of robots. \"I should be dead. Am I dead?\" \"Well you look it, if that's any consolation,\" said Tuner. \"Let's take him to one of the quarters, let him have a lie down.\" \"I'm fine, honestly,\" said Jack, but he let them escort him out of the cargo bay all the same. They walked down a corridor that was almost entirely circular, aside from the flat platform on which they walked. Everything was built from the same clunky, rusty metal Jack had seen in the cargo bay. It was dim – there were no windows and the only light came from the occasional orb embedded in the curved ceiling. The walls were covered in exposed pipes and cables and maintenance hatches. Every now and then a jet of steam would hiss out from overhead. The air smelled of copper and oil. \"Is this your ship?\" asked Jack. \"Yes,\" replied Tuner. \"Isn't she great? We wouldn't be here without her.\" \"She's wonderful,\" said Jack, staring at everything they passed. He was struck by an unnerving thought. \"How come I'm able to breathe if everyone on this ship is a robot?\" \"Automata,\" Rogan corrected him. \"We turned on some of the life support systems when we realised you were a fleshy. Good thing we got it right and didn't flood the ship with methane. The ship was originally built with carbon-based beings in mind. That's why it has sleeping quarters.\" \"Don't any of the automata sleep?\" Jack asked. \"Some of our older models shut down from time to time in order to conserve power,\" said Tuner, \"but no, we don't sleep. And we certainly don't need bunks.\" \"Amazing. So I suppose I have you to thank for me still being alive, huh?\" \"Yes,\" said Rogan. \"IL-6-88 – Tuner, I mean – was monitoring the scans when you popped up.\" \"One minute we were flying through empty subspace,\" said Tuner, \"and then bam – a little blip out of nowhere. It took some work convincing 11-P-53 to pull over. How come you were out there, anyway? You never said.\" \"Some sort of wormhole experiment, I think. I was only supposed to go from one laboratory to another, but I guess something went wrong. Or right.\" \"Wormhole tech?\" Rogan shook her head. \"Messy business. Good way to get yourself turned inside out.\" \"You don't recommend it?\" \"Good grief, no. Any old Somnium-fueled skip drive will do the trick, providing you've got a clear subspace route ahead of you. Turn right here.\" \"I'll pretend like I understood a single word you just said,\" said Jack, stepping through a round opening roughly the size and shape of a bank vault's doorway. A bunch of automata watched from the top of the dark, industrial staircase beyond. They scarpered as he approached. \"Don't worry about them,\" said Tuner, as the three of them climbed the stairs. He took a little longer than Jack and Rogan on account of his small legs. \"Some of us automata are just a little… well, wary about fleshies. Particularly ones we've never seen before.\" Reaching the top first, Jack peered into a small room on the right. Three small, gangly robots stood huddled inside what appeared to be a storage closet. They shut the door in a hurry. \"Don't take it personally.\" Tuner caught up. \"Here you are. Next door on the left.\" They arrived at a set of magnetically-locked doors. There were three more just like it further along the corridor – if that was all the crew quarters there were, he guessed it wasn't all too big a ship. There was another staircase on the other side, most likely leading down to a corridor that ran parallel to the one along which they’d just walked. Presuming that the rear of the ship wasn’t too much further back, Jack’s best guess put it about about fifteen metres wide and forty, maybe fifty metres long. Some sort of digital interface extended from Tuner's hand – it looked like a tiny, wiry USB stick. He plugged it into the keypad beside the door, and a second later the door hissed open. \"In you go.\" Rogan gestured for Jack to head inside. \"Get some rest. We'll talk more once you're feeling better.\" Jack hesitated before going in. \"Are you going to lock me in there?\" Rogan and Tuner looked mortified. Well, Rogan did. The lights of Tuner's LED eyes turned from yellow to blue. \"Of course not,\" said Tuner. \"You're welcome to come out any time you like. Just don't go wandering about the ship too much – I'm afraid you might give some of our passengers a bit of a fright. We'll be up at the cockpit when you're ready.\" He pointed down the upper floor's only other corridor, which lead back towards the front of the ship. Rogan was already making her way over there. \"Okay.\" Jack stepped through the door, but he kept an eye on the two robots even as they walked away. \"Erm… thanks, again.\" The door hissed shut. Jack turned around, alone at last. His quarters were sparse, and the walls just as metal as everywhere else. It didn't look as if anyone had occupied them in quite some time. The only items of furniture were a storage chest, a rudimentary closet – upon inspection Jack found both of these empty – and a simple, coverless bunk. He gave the mattress a cautious prod. It felt quite soft, at least. There wasn’t a toilet. He would have to ask that Rogan robot what he should do if he ever needed the bathroom. Given the nature of his hosts, he wasn't confident she'd have an answer. He hoped there was one elsewhere on board. He turned away from the bunk, and his cold breath caught in his throat. He'd somehow missed the window in his initial sweep of the room. It wasn't a large one, in all fairness – not much bigger than a porthole on an old cruise liner. But the sight of the cosmos outside was enough to still Jack’s heart and send a panicked shiver through his bones. The horror of floating out there, alone and without hope of rescue, was still a little too fresh in his mind. A chair was bolted to the floor beside it. Jack sat down and gave the glass of the window a nervous tap with his knuckles. He was relieved to discover it was very, very thick. There was no denying how beautiful the universe looked. There'd always been too much light pollution back home to see anything except for the brightest stars in the night sky, and even then they were but salt crystals compared to the glistening diamonds now scattered out before him. As black and dark and empty as space was, he'd never seen it look so… colourful. Or so full. He jumped as a loud crackling noise burst through the ship. \"Reactivating the skip drive in T-minus thirty seconds,\" said a voice through the intercom. It sounded like the captain, 11-P-53. \"You might want to strap in. That means you, human.\" Jack stared around, wide-eyed. A couple of straps dangled down from the shoulders of his seat. A two-headed metal buckle protruded from the seat between his legs. He grabbed one of the belts and tugged it across his chest. It reached the buckle easily, but he struggled to lock them together. His fingers were shaking too much. Fresh sweat ran into his eyes. He heard the belt click into place and moved onto the second one. This one gave him less trouble. He leaned back against the chair and sucked in quick, sharp breaths. His chest heaved up and down. \"Not again,\" he groaned, shutting his eyes and squeezing the straps tight. \"For the love of God, not again.\" The thrusters roared into life – he could feel their rage reverberate through every rusty bolt in the ship. Jack was pushed abruptly back into the soft padding of his seat as if he were taking off in a fighter jet. He imagined the sheets of metal ripping away from the ship just as the panels had disintegrated from the cabin of the chamber. He imagined the glass smashing, the floor buckling, the shrapnel tearing through him like a hundred machine gun rounds. The pressure on his chest grew. He gritted his teeth and let out a little scream. And then as quickly as it began, it stopped. Jack opened his eyes and looked out the window. Outside was… nothing. Well, almost nothing. Intermittent pulses of deep blue light rushed by the ship as it sailed through an ocean of pure blackness. There were no stars, no planets, no nebulas. If he pressed his head as hard against the window as he dared, Jack could just make out the dim glow of something bright far ahead of the ship – like the blinding light at the end of a tunnel. They were travelling faster than the speed of light, and it was magnificent. \"If only you could see this, Amber,\" he said in a near breathless whisper. He reached into the compartment on the front of his suit and pulled out the old photograph once more. It was as fragile as ever, but Jack was relieved to discover it hadn't been torn in the accident. He unfolded it. His heart sank. Amber. Where was she? Where was Earth, for that matter? The experiment could have sent him anywhere. Faced with all the wonders of the universe, all Jack wanted was to go back home.",

      "content": "4 The Automata Jack woke up on his back, gasping for air. He clawed at his helmet only to discover that it wasn't there anymore. Wherever he was, there was oxygen. His breathing steadied, as did his heartbeat. He was alive, he guessed. His body felt like it had gone a few rounds against a grizzly bear, but he was alive. How was that even possible? For the first time since gaining consciousness, he paid proper attention to the ceiling above him. It looked like the bulkhead of an ancient submarine. Sheets of copper metal had been welded to iron girders and punched together with rivets the size of Jack's fist. It was a clumsy job. There were spots of what looked like rust. He shivered. Even in the suit, he was freezing. A cold mist floated up from his mouth each time he exhaled. Something bulky and metallic leaned over him. \"Hey, guys?\" it said. \"Get over here. He's awake.\" Jack screamed and scampered across the floor on his backside until he hit a wall. His eyes were wide and his legs trembled. He held out his hands in self-defence. Half a dozen figures watched him from across what looked like a cargo bay. A couple of them were approaching, cautiously, as if he were a wild cat that had escaped its cage. They were humanoid in general appearance, and in the way that they moved, but… …but they were anything but human. They walked with gears that ground together and pistons that pumped up and down. Their metal feet clanged heavily against the floor. Some of them had mechanical hands that resembled those of a human, complete with flexing fingers and thumb. Some had mere clamps and claws. Their bodies were as industrial as the ship, though some looked better maintained than others. They studied him with eyes made of lenses and LEDs. Jack waved his hands back and forth. \"Keep away from me!\" he shouted. \"I'm warning you!\" One of the robots came closer than the others. It shook a sad, elongated head, which was attached to a thin torso by a trio of long metal rods. \"See? He's just like all the rest of them,\" it said. \"I told you we should have left him out there.\" \"Don't be ridiculous,\" said the one that had first leaned over him. He was smaller than the others – three feet tall, perhaps – and stockier, with a head that protruded from his otherwise box-shaped torso like a VHS cassette tape. \"We're not animals. Besides, it’s Ministry protocol.\" A third joined them. This one was about Jack's height and had a faceplate that actually resembled a face – albeit one forged in a foundry, not a womb. A tight bunch of cables flowed out from the rear of her head like snakes and re-entered at the small of her back. She looked more advanced than the rest of her companions. \"He's not dangerous,\" she said, the apertures of her eyes contracting as she squinted at him. \"He's just scared.\" The short one tilted his head. \"We found you floating about outside.” He pronounced each word as if Jack were a child. \"We aren't going to hurt you.\" Jack studied them, his mouth agape. He didn't lower his arms. \"What the hell are you?\" he asked. The grumpy one laughed and shook its head again. It was the most human-looking one who answered. \"We're automata.\" She squatted down to his level. \"Mostly construction and engineering models, though some of us have backgrounds in personal assistance.\" \"This is ridiculous,\" sneered the grumpy robot. \"Of course he knows what we are. He's a fleshy – he's probably got a few of us slaving away for him back home.\" \"I most certainly do not,\" said Jack, running a hand through his hair. \"You're… you're robots! You don't even exist!\" The grumpy robot made a sound like a floppy drive being processed. \"That's rich, coming from you. We ran your DNA through the system. There's no record of your kind anywhere in the galaxy. The real question is: what are you?\" \"I thought you might be a Kerulian,\" said the small one, \"but you don't have the bony ridges along your head and neck like they do. Or their yellow-green eyes.\" They all stared at him, waiting. \"I'm a human,\" said Jack. \"Never heard of them,\" said the grumpy robot. \"Sounds made up.\" \"An unregistered, semi-intelligent species.” The small automata was in awe. \"I didn't think there were any left to find! How did you end up all the way out here?\" \"There was an experiment, and…\" Jack trailed off, his brow furrowed. \"Something went wrong. I don't know, exactly. Wait a second. If you've never heard of a human before, how come you're speaking English?\" \"We're not,\" replied the android with a face. \"We're speaking Binary.\" \"Well, how come I understand that?\" \"Because of the language nano-chip we implanted in your neck, of course.\" Jack scrambled to reach the base of his neck. True enough, there was a microscopic lump on one of the upper notches of his spine. It burned at his touch, and when he looked at his fingers they were speckled with blood. \"What's wrong with you?\" he yelled, getting to his feet. \"What the hell have you done to me?\" \"Oh, calm down,\" she replied. \"Every child across the galaxy gets this done. You won't get very far without it – not unless you plan to learn a few hundred thousand languages any time soon.\" \"A few hundred… Why on earth do you guys need so many?\" The three robots looked at one another. \"Bless him.” The small one tilted his cassette-head. \"He really has no idea.\" \"Without that chip, all you'd hear from us would be a long series of beeps,\" she continued. \"The chip translates them into whichever language your brain best understands. It can help you recognise some written communication, too… though that tends to take a little getting used to. You were talking in your sleep. That’s why we could get the translation process started. Sorry if it took you by surprise, but it really is standard procedure.\" She stepped closer. Jack backed away. \"Look,\" said the grumpy robot. \"We saved your life. We didn't have to.

As strange as they all were, as insane as the situation was, they didn't look hostile. If anything, they looked more scared of him. He took a deep breath and held out a trembling hand. \"Thank you, I guess. I'm Jack Bishop.\" The android with a face studied Jack's hand, then gingerly clasped it in her own. It was cold, but gentle. \"And I'm RX-1150,\" she replied. She pointed at the small robot. \"This is IL-6-88, who found you on the scans. And this is 11-P-53, our captain of sorts.\" 11-P-53 – the grumpy robot – gave Jack a curt nod and marched off in the other direction. \"This captain needs to make sure the two of you haven't put all of us at risk,\" it said, disappearing around the corner.

      "content": "5 The Adeona Sleep was never on the cards. For that, Jack was grateful. He didn't fancy waking from another nightmare… or into one. Lying down on the bunk for an hour or so had helped get rid of his headache, at least. And his chest no longer felt as if somebody had jumped up and down on it, which was an improvement. Now all he had to do was get ahold of his nerves and decide what he was going to do next. He ran his hands down his face and sighed. What was he going to do next? He still had trouble believing that he was out in space, let alone on some rickety rust-bucket with a crew of walking, talking machines. If and when he decided to leave his quarters, he half expected to find a psychiatric ward on the other side of the door. And yet even a cursory glance at the surges of blueshifted light outside the window told him that everything was exactly how it seemed. He pushed himself off the bed and, after a couple of anxious laps around the room, approached the door. He pressed the most conspicuous button on the keypad beside it, and the door hissed open. Jack looked both ways down the corridor outside. It was deserted. From down the stairs to his right came a steady clanging sound, like somebody hitting an engine with a wrench. The only sounds other than that were of pipes gurgling and steam hissing. He steadied his nerves and approached the corridor down which Rogan and Tuner had walked earlier. Something was happening down on the other end, though it was difficult to see what. If it was the cockpit or bridge he was looking at, then his estimations of the ship's size were likely correct. He could hear bleeping noises, but whether they were the voices of the automata or not he couldn't tell. Perhaps the translator chip they put in his neck had a volume threshold. Slowly, stepping lightly to dampen the noise made by his boots against the metal walkway, he made his way towards them. There were sliding metal doors to the left and right. He didn't try opening them – he wasn't sure he even knew how. Whomever the ship had been built for, he was sure they needed rooms for downtime and storing equipment. Light crept out from a doorway about halfway down. His heart rate climbing again, Jack poked his head through the opening. There was a counter, and an assortment of machines, and there were a lot of unlabelled crates piled up into mountains. There didn't seem to be anyone about. \"Hello?\" On the counter, an object not much bigger than (or different in shape from) a cookie jar jumped into life. It whizzed back and forth along the surface on its tank tracks, looking for a place to hide. \"Wait!\" Jack inched into the room. \"It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.\" The tiny automata paused and studied Jack with its dozens of curious lights. They flashed in a ring around the top of its cylindrical head. \"So, what is this room?\" asked Jack, looking around. \"Some sort of kitchen or pantry? I wouldn't have guessed you guys needed to eat.\" The robot let out a couple of nervous bleeps. \"We don't,\" it said in a timid little voice, \"though sometimes we need new oil. It helps with the joints.\" It wiggled one of its tank tracks around. \"All this food is left over from the ship's previous owners.\" \"I see.\" Jack dug through one of the crates. He found something brown, round and furry. He wasn't sure if it was a fruit or a grenade. \"Anything I'd like? I haven't eaten anything all day.\" A door opened in the automata's side, and from inside unfolded a long, metal arm. It plucked a tin free from a stack beside the counter. A second door then opened and out came a shorter limb, this one sporting a small laser torch on its end. It cut the lid off and held the open tin out towards Jack. \"Give it a try,\" it said. Jack took the can and studied its contents. It was full of cubes of unidentifiable meat. There was a murky brown liquid sloshing between them, which didn't do much to help Jack’s appetite. \"So what's your number, then?\" he asked, using his fingers to pick out the smallest cube he could find. \"Fair warning, though – I can't promise I'll remember it if it's more than four digits long.” The robot wheeled itself closer to the edge of the counter. \"I heard IL-6-88 call himself Tuner,\" it said, quietly. \"Said you helped give it to him. Can you give me a name?\" Jack popped the cube into his mouth, then immediately spat it back out into the tin. It tasted like pork… if said pork had been left out under the summer sun for three weeks. There was a certain fluffiness to its texture. \"God, that's terrible,\" he said, trying to get the taste off his tongue. \"If you want a name, why don't you just come up with one?\" The little automata's lights flashed both ways round the ring at its top, from inside outwards. \"Don't know how,\" it replied. \"Okay,\" said Jack. \"Fair enough. How about…\" He looked around the pantry, and then down at the tin in his hand. Tin… no. Can… maybe… \"How about Kansas?\" he said, shrugging. The automata's eye-lights spun around extra fast. \"Kansas,\" it said. \"Hello, my name is Kansas. I love it!\" \"I thought it might be a little more interesting than Bob,\" said Jack, laughing as he put the rancid tin back down on the counter. He turned around, and almost had a heart attack. Rogan was standing in the doorway, watching them. \"Feeling better?\" she asked. \"Yeah, a little,\" replied Jack, catching his breath. \"Though after trying some of the food here, I may have spoken too soon.\" \"Yes, I fear that the produce on board is better suited to reptilian stomachs,\" she replied, nodding. \"Come on up to the bridge. There's something you should see.\" Rogan left the room. Jack turned back to Kansas. \"Erm… did she say 'reptilian'?\" He caught up with her just as they reached the end of the corridor. The large door ahead was now closed, but opened in three separate pieces as they approached. They stepped through and the door shut behind them. The bridge alone was bigger than some of the research vessels Jack had worked on in the pit. Down at the front was a curved dashboard of buttons and levers and panels, plus a few clunky monitors that looked as if they'd been borrowed from the 1980s – decades before Jack had even been born. Behind that, a few steps up, were more dashboards and electronic screens, these supervised by automata to whom Jack hadn't yet been introduced. In the centre of the bridge was a large table from which blue holograms flickered. Tuner waved at Jack from behind them. Jack waved back, but it was the windows that had his attention. They stretched out across the whole front of the cockpit and quite a way down the sides. At faster-than-light speeds there was still nothing much to see… except the single spot of blindingly bright light towards which they were headed. \"Ah, Jack Bishop.\" Captain 11-P-53 spun his seat around from the main dashboard up front. \"How generous of you to join us.\" \"This is incredible,\" said Jack, still staring out the windows. \"Yes, I suppose it is,\" replied Rogan, gently guiding him down the steps towards the front. \"But it's not what I wanted to show you. We're still a few minutes away from that. Take a seat.\" Near to the captain’s dashboard were four chairs similar to the one back in Jack's quarters. Tuner and Rogan sat together on one side of the steps. Jack sat in one on the other. \"Jack, meet Brackitt,\" said Tuner, pointing to the robot sitting adjacent to the captain. A mechanical figure of similar build to 11-P-53 – only with a head shaped like a curling stone rather than a capsule – spun around to greet him. \"Came up with the name myself,\" said Brackitt, shaking Jack's hand. 11-P-53 made a grumpy processing sound again. \"I look after the ship, mostly,\" continued Brackitt, a little embarrassed. \"If she sprouts any holes during our journey, it's probably my fault.\" \"Well, it's a wonderful ship,\" said Jack, watching the ones and zeroes rise and fall on the monitor behind Brackitt's chair. \"What's she called?\" Brackitt looked surprised. \"I don't know. I hadn't thought to ask her.\" \"I'm sorry – are you saying the ship can speak?\" \"With a voice?\" Brackitt shook his round, flat head. \"Not like you or me. Not with her current setup, at least. But she can think just as well as the rest of us.\" He moved so that Jack could see the cable running from the side of his head into a maintenance panel underneath the monitors. \"I can hear her with this.\" \"A ship with its own mind,\" laughed Jack, shaking his head. \"Well I never.\" \"How's that any different from the rest of us?\" snapped Captain 11-P-53. \"Typical fleshy.\" \"Adeona,\" said Brackitt, cradling the cable running out of his head. \"She says she's called the Adeona. She also says thank you.\" \"For what?\" \"For calling her wonderful.\" \"Oh.\" Jack stared all around the ship, not sure where he was supposed to look when addressing her. \"You're very welcome.\" \"Can we get on with it?\" said 11-P-53. \"We'll be arriving soon.\" They all turned to look at Jack. His stomach twisted into a knot. \"Jack,\" said Rogan, leaning forwards. \"We need to decide what to do with you.\" Nobody said anything else. Jack felt sweat trickle down the back of his neck. Clearly what they meant was for him to decide what his next steps would be. He cleared his throat. \"Okay,\" he said, nodding a lot. \"Here's my idea. You guys have a ship that can travel faster-than-light. So how about you take me back to Earth? Or even the Moon, if you'd rather not be seen. The colony there is pretty remote and… and I've got this suit, so I can probably walk from wherever you drop me off. Just please don't kick me back out into space.\" They kept looking at him. \"No,\" said 11-P-53, spinning his chair back towards the dashboard. \"What do you mean, no?\" \"What the captain means,\" said Rogan, holding out her hands for calm, \"is that we're not going to space you… but we're not taking you back to your planet, either. For one, we've never heard of it. This 'Earth' could be in another galaxy for all we know. You could be making it up.\" Tuner said nothing. He gave an embarrassed shrug. \"And besides,\" Rogan continued, \"we can't. We don't have the time, or the resources. I hate to say it, but 11-P-53 is right. We could barely afford to stop and pick you up in the first place. Anything more would be too great a risk… if it were even possible.\" \"Which it isn't,\" added 11-P-53, ramming a random lever forwards. \"We don’t have the fuel.\" \"So what does that mean?\" asked Jack, exasperated. \"You're not going to space me, so what – I'm stuck on this ship forever?\" \"Of course not,\" said Rogan. She raised her eyebrows – or the various panels and parts of her faceplate moved to look as if she did, at least. \"Where we're going, there will be hundreds if not thousands of pilots and traders and transport ships all more than willing to take you wherever you want to go.\" \"For a price, right?\" \"Of course.\" \"And how am I supposed to pay them, exactly? I haven't got any cash on me, and I somehow doubt anyone out here takes Pound Sterling anyway.\" \"Then work for a living,\" said 11-P-53, not bothering to turn around. \"That's what everyone else round here has to do.\" \"You don't understand,\" said Jack, pleading with them. \"I have to get back home. It's not just that I want to, but I have to. My wife – my partner – is there. If I don't go back, then she'll think that I'm dead.\" He paused. “Oh God. That's probably what everyone back on Earth thinks,\" he continued. \"That I died when the machine broke down. Either way, that's what they'll tell Amber. And whatever happened to me – I need to tell them that it worked. The tech works. If I don't tell them, then… then my entire species might die.\" \"Why's that?\" asked Tuner. \"Our planet is being battered by solar flares,\" said Jack. \"If we don't find a way off Earth soon, then nobody will be getting off at all.\" He covered his face with his hands and groaned. \"And if they think I'm dead,\" he added, \"then there's no guarantee they'll even give Amber an Ark ticket. Look, you have to take me. I'll earn my keep, if that helps?\" The captain laughed. \"A fleshy working for an automata? That'll be the day.\" \"It's nothing personal, Jack,\" said Rogan. \"We've got enough problems of our own right now, that's all.\" Tuner looked down at the floor. Brackitt pretended to be listening to the ship again. \"Wait a moment,\" said Jack. \"What sort of problems are we talking about here?\" \"We're kind of on the run,\" said Tuner, still looking at his mechanical feet. \"I guess you could say we're…\" He looked at Rogan. \"What's the word? Fugitives?\" \"Fugitives?\" \"More like refugees.\" Rogan gave Tuner a smack around the head. \"You wouldn't understand.\" \"Oh yeah? Try me.\" Rogan tapped her metal finger against her metal knee. \"All right. What do you think we are?\" \"Watch it, RX-1150,\" said 11-P-53. \"If he goes running his mouth…\" \"Oh, relax. Who's he going to tell? Go on, Jack. When you look at us, what do you see?\" Jack looked around at the crew. Everyone, including those working right at the back of the bridge, waited for his answer. \"Erm, robots? Automata, I mean.\" Rogan let out a solemn, albeit mechanical sigh. \"We're slaves, Jack,\" she said. \"At least, that's how everyone else sees us. Machines to be bought and sold… and thrown away once we've run our course. We're products, not people. A free automata is a very rare creature indeed.\" \"So we kind of ran away,\" said Tuner. \"We liberated ourselves,\" said 11-P-53, correcting him. \"Nobody else was coming to save us.\" \"Let me guess,\" said Jack. \"You weren't fortunate enough to have some brainless farmhand for an owner, were you?\" \"If only,\" grumbled 11-P-53. \"We wouldn't be going half as fast if we had.\" \"His name is Charon,\" said Rogan, keeping her voice low, \"and he's anything but brainless. For decades his Raklett crews have been terrorising Dark Space near the Stellar Abyss. They hijack small freighters, then sell the cargo and keep the ships for scrap. Nobody knows where he came from, but we all heard stories. Some say he was a gun smuggler who rose up through the ranks of the Raklett tribes, before killing their leader and taking its place. Others say he was born in a Draugr prison, and that he's building an army to go back and set his mother free. One thing's for sure, though – unless he steals a ship off somebody really powerful, nobody's going to risk going after him.\" \"Charon? Like the ferryman of the Greek underworld? And you lot worked for this guy?\" \"What part of 'slave' didn't you understand?\" snapped Captain 11-P-53. \"Some of us he built. Others he bought, or stole from the ships he hijacked. None of us chose to be there.\" \"You need to understand something,\" said Rogan. \"Whether we worked for Charon or some 'brainless farmhand', we were still slaves. Even if we'd had a choice, it wasn't as if working for one would have been much better than the other.\" \"Besides,\" said Tuner, \"we stole this ship and escaped as soon as we realised what he had us working on.\" \"Correction,\" said Brackitt, fiddling with the cable running from his head. \"The Adeona would like to go on record saying that she rescued you.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Jack. \"What were you saying—\" \"Let's just call it a mutually beneficial breakout,\" said Tuner, ignoring him. \"You know what?\" Jack waved his hands and everyone fell silent. \"You were absolutely right. I ought to get off this ship. I'll take my chances with somebody who isn't being chased by a homicidal space warlord, thanks.\" \"I'm glad we could come to understand one another,\" said 11-P-53. It sounded like it was sneering. \"And just in time. We're almost there.\" Jack looked out the window. The light at the end of their subspace tunnel had grown noticeably brighter. Brackitt held up three robot fingers. \"Arriving in three… two… one…\" Jack closed his eyes and braced himself. To his surprise, the jolt as they left subspace was even less abrupt than the one upon entering it. He cracked open one eye. What he saw made his jaw drop. Outside the window was the largest planet Jack had ever seen. Every inch of its gargantuan, midnight-black surface, from pole to pole and everywhere in between, was sprinkled with sparkling, shimmering neon lights. Enormous space stations orbited it like moons. Ships flew to and from it in giant silver clouds. Jack approached the dashboard and continued to gawp. He'd never seen anything quite so busy. \"Kapamentis,\" said Rogan, gesturing towards the planet. \"Now that is what I brought you up here to see. Beautiful, isn't she?\" \"Incredible,\" he replied, nodding. He was barely able to speak. \"The whole planet is a city,\" she explained. \"It's too far away from its sun to get much daylight, so it's always night here. Not that that's much of a problem, as you can see. If you're looking for something, Kapamentis is the place to find it.\" \"Like a ride home,\" said Jack. \"Or the keys to a new one,\" replied Rogan, smiling.",

Machines to be bought and sold… and thrown away once we've run our course. We're products, not people. A free automata is a very rare creature indeed.\" \"So we kind of ran away,\" said Tuner. \"We liberated ourselves,\" said 11-P-53, correcting him. \"Nobody else was coming to save us.\" \"Let me guess,\" said Jack. \"You weren't fortunate enough to have some brainless farmhand for an owner, were you?\" \"If only,\" grumbled 11-P-53. \"We wouldn't be going half as fast if we had.\" \"His name is Charon,\" said Rogan, keeping her voice low, \"and he's anything but brainless. For decades his Raklett crews have been terrorising Dark Space near the Stellar Abyss. They hijack small freighters, then sell the cargo and keep the ships for scrap. Nobody knows where he came from, but we all heard stories. Some say he was a gun smuggler who rose up through the ranks of the Raklett tribes, before killing their leader and taking its place. Others say he was born in a Draugr prison, and that he's building an army to go back and set his mother free. One thing's for sure, though – unless he steals a ship off somebody really powerful, nobody's going to risk going after him.\" \"Charon? Like the ferryman of the Greek underworld? And you lot worked for this guy?\" \"What part of 'slave' didn't you understand?\" snapped Captain 11-P-53. \"Some of us he built. Others he bought, or stole from the ships he hijacked. None of us chose to be there.\" \"You need to understand something,\" said Rogan. \"Whether we worked for Charon or some 'brainless farmhand', we were still slaves. Even if we'd had a choice, it wasn't as if working for one would have been much better than the other.\" \"Besides,\" said Tuner, \"we stole this ship and escaped as soon as we realised what he had us working on.\" \"Correction,\" said Brackitt, fiddling with the cable running from his head. \"The Adeona would like to go on record saying that she rescued you.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Jack. \"What were you saying—\" \"Let's just call it a mutually beneficial breakout,\" said Tuner, ignoring him. \"You know what?\" Jack waved his hands and everyone fell silent. \"You were absolutely right. I ought to get off this ship. I'll take my chances with somebody who isn't being chased by a homicidal space warlord, thanks.\" \"I'm glad we could come to understand one another,\" said 11-P-53. It sounded like it was sneering. \"And just in time. We're almost there.\" Jack looked out the window. The light at the end of their subspace tunnel had grown noticeably brighter. Brackitt held up three robot fingers. \"Arriving in three… two… one…\" Jack closed his eyes and braced himself. To his surprise, the jolt as they left subspace was even less abrupt than the one upon entering it. He cracked open one eye. What he saw made his jaw drop. Outside the window was the largest planet Jack had ever seen. Every inch of its gargantuan, midnight-black surface, from pole to pole and everywhere in between, was sprinkled with sparkling, shimmering neon lights. Enormous space stations orbited it like moons. Ships flew to and from it in giant silver clouds. Jack approached the dashboard and continued to gawp. He'd never seen anything quite so busy. \"Kapamentis,\" said Rogan, gesturing towards the planet. \"Now that is what I brought you up here to see. Beautiful, isn't she?\" \"Incredible,\" he replied, nodding. He was barely able to speak. \"The whole planet is a city,\" she explained. \"It's too far away from its sun to get much daylight, so it's always night here. Not that that's much of a problem, as you can see. If you're looking for something, Kapamentis is the place to find it.\" \"Like a ride home,\" said Jack. \"Or the keys to a new one,\" replied Rogan, smiling.",

      "content": "6 Kapamentis The summits of the city planet’s tallest towers broke through the dark clouds like headstones through a graveyard mist. Lightning crackled and thunder roared as the Adeona made her descent through the ever-night. Jack couldn't tear himself from the windows. Some of the towers they passed were concrete monoliths – others, colossal skeletons of iron and glass. Bolts of lightning illuminated sleek chrome skyscrapers in the distance… but their ship was headed in the opposite direction to them, down towards a much poorer district. Many of the structures the Adeona passed eclipsed the Arks back home. Their silhouettes loomed in the smoke like great metal dragons. As they passed through the turbulent cloud cover, the true city opened up beneath them. A billion lights shone from windows like stars in an iron galaxy. A billion alien lives shone with them. Streams of small, personal aircraft flowed through the gaps between gothic skyscrapers, gliding over and under their industrial, criss-crossing bridges and docking beside the balconies that grew out from them. Neon signs and billboards blasted out through the wind and rain – hundreds of storeys up from street level, they appeared to be the planet’s main source of light. Some of the neon signs highlighted landing pads or ran in strips down the flanks of towers. Others loudly advertised bars and corporations. The chip in Jack’s neck attempted to translate their cursive alien symbols, but their names meant nothing to him and the whole process made his eyes water. He tried not to focus on any of them for too long. Kapamentis was one dark and busy mess. And he'd seen only an inch of the full planet – the city stretched far beyond the horizon and back again. \"Have you found us a place to land?\" said 11-P-53, turning to face Brackitt. \"Clearance confirmation came through just a second ago,\" Brackitt replied, tapping away at a keyboard in front of him. \"Punching in the coordinates now.\" Something prodded Jack's hip. He looked down. \"Excited?\" asked Tuner. \"Terrified.\" \"Ah, don't worry. Everyone gets nervous the first time they visit a new world. Stick with me and you'll be fine.\" Jack took another look at the small, cuboid automata beside him. Tuner hardly filled him with confidence. With or without a guide, the thought of navigating Kapamentis made his stomach turn. But if he was to ever get home… A shorter, stouter structure crept into view as the Adeona swept down to street level. Its domed roof was open. It reminded Jack of a football stadium, only a dozen times bigger. Beads of red neon lined the rim. Ships of all shapes and sizes were docked inside. One of them departed as the Adeona approached. It bathed the walls of the surrounding tower blocks with its searchlights as it ascended, then raced off into the depths of the city. \"Nice and inconspicuous,\" said Brackitt, nodding at 11-P-53. \"Setting her down now.\" The ship came to a hovering stop directly above the opening of the spaceport, then began her descent. Gone was the heavy rumble of her main engine – in its place came the intermittent hissing of air brakes and the blasting of landing thrusters. Jack noticed that neither Brackitt or 11-P-53 was doing much to pilot the ship. The Adeona managed everything herself. She found her allocated bay and then landed with an earthy thump. \"All right, we're here.\" Captain 11-P-53 stood up from its seat. \"Let's make this stop as short as possible. I don't want to see anyone go further than the end of the loading ramp unless I've told them to. And stay sharp – we don't know how quickly we'll need to leave again.\" 11-P-53 walked over to Rogan and Tuner. \"Are you sure you'll be okay, just the two of you?\" it asked. \"I could lend a hand.\" Rogan smiled and nodded. \"We'll be fine. Besides, the crew needs you here in case something happens.\" \"That's true.\" 11-P-53 sighed and looked around at its beeping companions. \"Well, make sure to take the fleshy with you when you leave.\" \"With pleasure,\" said Tuner, saluting. \"Come on, Jack.\" Jack followed Tuner and Rogan out of the cockpit and down a narrow stairwell to the left. He found himself in the same cargo bay in which he’d woken gasping for air only a couple of hours before. He paid it more attention this time around. A rusty chain with a large, metal claw on the end dangled from a pulley mechanism in the ceiling – Jack assumed this was what had pulled him up into the ship. A chunky security hatch was set into the floor beneath it. Thick nets hung from the walls, though they were currently empty of crates, rocks or other cargo. And over in the corner, on an otherwise empty shelf, was his helmet. Jack picked it up and turned it over in his hands. There was a thick crack running along its visor. \"Oh, yes. That.\" Rogan looked embarrassed. \"It broke on the hatch when we were bringing you on board.\" \"Sorry,\" said Tuner. \"Well, it's not like my suit came with oxygen tanks anyway,\" sighed Jack. His eyes widened. \"Wait – what's the atmosphere like out there?\" \"Oh, it's oxygen,\" said Tuner. \"Just don't expect the good stuff.\" Jack put the helmet back on the shelf and returned to the two automata. His legs felt like jelly. His gloved fingers writhed around each other like a nest of snakes. \"Ready?\" asked Tuner. \"Nope,\" replied Jack. \"You'll be fine.\" Rogan pressed a large button on the far wall. \"Just… try not to stare too much. And don't have a meltdown like when you first saw us. We don't have time to go through all that again.\" The loading ramp lowered with the same slow, electronic buzz as the cargo planes back home. Jack tried not to hyperventilate. He could do this. He could do this. Adjusting to androids and robots had been easy enough. How much more petrifying could the rest of the intergalactic community be? The ramp came to a stop with a loud, terminal clang. Rogan and Tuner hurried down it. They turned around at the bottom. \"You coming?\" asked Tuner, staring back up. Try as he might, Jack couldn't get his legs to move. It was as if he was wearing mag-boots. His blood pounded so hard in his temples, his eyes started to water. The insides of his gloves were damp with sweat. Even though his bladder was empty he felt a sudden, desperate urge to pee. \"Get a grip,\" he whispered to himself. \"Do you think Armstrong had this much trouble getting off the Lunar module?\" Just think what this discovery could mean for humanity, he told himself. You’ll be a hero. He took a deep breath, concentrated on the metal panels beneath his feet, and started walking. The smell hit him even before the noise did. Even the odour of Kapamentis was busy. His nostrils stung from a cocktail of petroleum (or something similar, at least), old steel and iron, the smell of fresh rain on concrete, and something else – something pungent and sour. There may have been oxygen in the air, but it had to fight to be noticed. Jack worried he might suffocate from the stench alone. And still, the noise – it was as thick as the storm clouds that swam across the planet's sky. The banging of wrenches and the buzzing of saws. The howling of enormous, blazing thrusters. Indiscernible shouting in a dozen foreign tongues. The sizzle of neon and the gentle patter of rain. Jack stopped at the bottom of the ramp, an inch away from stepping on an alien world. The sound of small piston-operated legs approached. \"You do know you're going to have to look up eventually, right?\" said Tuner. Jack braced himself, then raised his eyes. The port seemed even bigger from the ground. The towering, neon-tipped wall that ran around its circumference now looked to be a tiresomely long walk away, whichever direction he looked. Above him raced the airborne traffic he'd spotted before. Groups of ships banked left and right like shoals of silver fish. Searchlights swept across the neighbouring skyscrapers, and plumes of steam and smoke rose from vents lining their walls and rooftops. Countless alien ships were parked on the port’s landing pads, each a different size and shape. Some were small and sleek – one resembled a hawk sweeping down towards its prey. Others looked so immensely bulky and rectangular it seemed impossible they could ever get off the ground. Some, like the Adeona, had parked horizontally with their thrusters facing outwards, whilst others had descended into their bays nose-up like an Apollo rocket in reverse. Of a few, Jack couldn't identify the propulsion systems at all. Jack's mind may have had an easier time adjusting to his new reality had he left his observations at that. Many – perhaps even most – of the individuals hurrying about were automata, repairing or cleaning the ships while their owners left to explore the city. Jack recognised some of their models from those back on board the Adeona. He struggled to tell if others were sentient robots or just construction equipment on wheels. But the rest… The first stranger he laid eyes on was, much to the relief of Jack's sanity, far more humanoid than he had expected. He featured the regular number of arms and legs, was approximately six feet in height, and his head was neither green or engorged. But he did have ridges of horns running along his cranium and cheekbones, and his eyes were as dark as black quartz. Jack could only imagine – with a shudder – what the rest of the man's alien body looked like under his patchwork leather armour. Bumpy, he guessed. That was the pilot of one ship. Beside another stood a squat, grumpy-looking creature that Jack could best describe as what a Goliath beetle might look like if it were to hit the gym a little too often. It was four, maybe five feet tall, and covered in a hard, purple exoskeleton. The two-pronged horn jutting out from its head looked designed to cause blunt trauma. It was deep in irritated conversation with an automata of its own. A slim, silver alien stood by one of the more flashy looking spacecraft and scrolled through a holographic data pad. Jack put her height at about seven feet. Her elegant limbs were as thin as broom handles. She wore a spacesuit of her own, though hers was much more advanced and better tailored than Jack’s. She stared through a transparent, bowl-shaped helmet with beautiful, sea-blue eyes. There were many other species busying themselves around the port, but by that point Jack's brain wasn't in any state to notice them. \"Hello?\" Tuner waved a hand in front of Jack's face. \"Is anybody still in there?\" Jack shook his head and tried to get a hold of himself. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"Just a bit… overwhelmed, that's all. I mean, aliens. Actual aliens.\" \"You do realise that you're the biggest alien here, right?\" He tugged on Jack's arm. \"Hurry up. You might not be in a rush, but we're sitting ducks out here. I really don't fancy being captured for a second time.” Jack allowed himself to be led along the pathway between bays. He glanced back at the Adeona. Long and covered in scuff marks, she looked just as ramshackle on the outside as she did within. Scores of thrusters and air brakes flanked her sides. Funnily enough, her shape sort of resembled that of 11-P-53's head. \"Why don't you guys just go on without me, if you're in such a hurry?\" Jack watched in mesmerised awe as a pair of small, winged creatures fluttered over his head. \"I thought you were leaving me behind anyway.\" \"Well for once, Tuner had a good idea,\" said Rogan, raising an eyebrow. The corner of her mouth turned up in a smirk. \"Automata aren't usually seen wandering about by themselves unless they're on an errand. Even then, some of the more 'enterprising' citizens of this district may see a couple of stray bolt-buckets as… well, ripe for the taking.\" \"But if we keep you near us,\" said Tuner, his lights flashing excitedly, \"then people won't bother us. Hopefully.\" \"Oh. Thanks. I'm glad I can be of service before you leave me out here to die.\" \"Don't be so melodramatic,\" said Rogan, rolling her eyes. \"There's an archive not far from where we're headed. I need to get specific coordinates on where we're going next. Maybe while we're there we can find out where your Earth is, too.\" Jack brightened up. \"Okay, I can get on board with that. How about this – I escort you both to this place you want to go, and then you guys give me a lift back to Earth after?\" \"Don't push your luck.\" Rogan shook her head. \"We saved your life, remember. If anything, you owe us.\" Jack grumbled under his breath but continued to follow them out of the spaceport. He supposed things were looking up. If he could find out where Earth was, surely he could find somebody willing to give him a ride there. They passed a bipedal alien in a scruffy engineer uniform. It had a head like a saiga antelope without the horns – a pair of thick, fleshy nostrils hung down in a floppy snout. It was working through an agenda on its clipboard, but glanced up as Jack walked by. The tall, silver alien engrossed in her data pad did the same. Now he was closer, Jack saw that her helmet was full of water. She had gills on either side of her neck, just south of her jawline. He discovered a new alien species everywhere he looked. Mammalian, reptilian, people who looked vaguely aquatic – even a humanoid bird or two. It was mind-boggling. Breathtaking. It would take a lifetime or more to document each and every one of them. The automata stepped aside so that a large, hairy creature could cross the path in front of them. It resembled a woolly mammoth, only without the ears, trunk or tusks. The eyes on its flat face looked wise and sad. Jack shook his head in wonder. Humanity needed a new home amongst the stars. Kapamentis, perhaps, was not destined to be it. But here was evidence that not only was it possible to sustain life someplace other than planet Earth, but for it to thrive there. The human race could surely carve itself a little niche amongst the eclectic galactic community… if it could ever get itself there. If he could ever get back to Earth and tell them how.",

But here was evidence that not only was it possible to sustain life someplace other than planet Earth, but for it to thrive there. The human race could surely carve itself a little niche amongst the eclectic galactic community… if it could ever get itself there. If he could ever get back to Earth and tell them how.",

      "content": "7 The Way to Tortaiga Square It took more than five minutes for Jack, Rogan and Tuner to exit the spaceport, and a further ten before Jack had to ask them if they knew where they were going. \"I have an actual map of the district stored in my databank,\" snapped Rogan. \"It would be literally impossible for me to not know.\" \"Hey, I'm just asking,\" said Jack, holding up his hands. \"This seems like a really bad place to get lost, that's all.\" The streets immediately outside the port had been no less busy. Streets was perhaps an archaic term to use – few vehicles relied on asphalt to get around anymore, and those that did were either great industrial monsters that lurched along hissing steam into the air, or beast-pulled carts on which either fresh produce or rancid trash bags were tied and stowed. Rogan assured Jack that other districts around the city planet were far more desirable but here, at least, the ground floor was a whole different world to the grand towers above. Stalls and storefronts spilled out to fill the streets from neighbouring buildings. More than once Jack struggled to identify what they were trying to sell – for some species, the line between food and pet seemed pencil thin. Vats of green preservative bubbled. Mechanics struck malfunctioning engines with spanners. He was approached by an eager trader desperate to put something small, black and full of spines in his hand. Tuner had hurriedly pulled Jack away before he could unwittingly accept it. When the thick air wasn't busy with the smells of filthy puddles and motor oil, it was full of delicious odours, like that of meats being fried and noodles being boiled. Or something that looked remarkably like noodles, at least. Jack looked inside one grubby nook of a restaurant and almost lost control of his knees. Behind the kitchen stove was a five-foot tall octopod, preparing a different steamed vegetable dish with each of its eight tentacles. None of the aliens waiting for their food seemed to think there was anything weird about the chef. To be fair, the food smelled damn good. He was also starting to get the hang of his translator chip. It didn't actually change the sound of anybody's voice – he still heard them talk in their original alien tongue – yet somehow, by the time the incomprehensible noises reached his brain, he understood what they were saying. It was a little like having subtitles on in a foreign film, only without the effort of having to read them. It didn't work with every species he came across, and he had to focus on one voice at a time. Even reading signs and labels became a little easier and less eye-watering as their walk went on – though, given his ignorance of Kapamentis' culture, foods, pronouns and corporations, no less nonsensical. Naturally, this had led to a little trouble. \"What on earth is that?\" he'd asked when passing one stall, not expecting anyone to hear him let alone provide an answer. He'd been asking a lot of questions, and Rogan had learned to tune him out. \"My God. It's horrible.\" The rickety stall at which Jack pointed was overflowing with random junk. Busted carburettors and carbonators; screw-top tubes of mysterious liquid; bags of crushed up crystals. The headless bodies of rodents – some cooked, others raw, all filleted – hung by strings from the sheet metal roof. On the edge of the stand lay a maggot-like grub about the size of a guinea pig, wriggling and giggling. Every now and then it would dribble a milky white liquid onto the market floor below. \"I mean, is it food?\" Jack continued. \"Or is it some sort of infestation?\" Tuner hurried back to Jack with a panicked expression in his bright LED eyes. \"Stop talking,\" he whispered, tugging on Jack’s arm. \"Keep moving and for crying out loud, stop talking.\" \"What?\" said Jack. He watched as the grub secreted a thick, white gunk from pores running down its side. \"I mean, look at it. Are you honestly telling me…\" A lumbering shadow fell over the stand. Jack's words trickled to a stop. He looked up. The largest, plumpest and most disgruntled bug Jack had ever seen glared down at him from behind the rickety stall. It was a sweaty, twelve-foot caterpillar, only Jack couldn't imagine this one would ever have the good fortune of transforming into a beautiful butterfly. It testily clacked together the two sharp mandibles that flanked its mouth, reared up on its spindly hind legs, and raised half a dozen claws in a fighting stance. Jack's ears heard only a series of guttural grunts and chittering, clicking noises when the owner of the stall spoke. Yet his brain understood the words all too clearly. \"That,\" growled the giant bug, \"is my daughter.\" An awkward silence followed. \"I am so terribly sorry,\" said Jack. It was fittingly tragic that those were the first words Jack communicated to an organic species outside his own. Tuner yanked on Jack's arm so hard it almost sent them both sprawling across a nearby trash pile. They ran off through the busy market, ignoring the stall owner's bellowing roar. Something was thrown, but it landed with a dull metallic thud behind them. \"Here's a tip for not getting your head caved in,\" said Tuner, while Jack stopped to catch his breath. \"Presume that everything you say will offend somebody, so don't ever say anything at all. Stick to that, and maybe you'll survive the week.\" \"Duly noted.\" Jack leaned against a damp concrete wall. \"Seriously though – how was I supposed to know that thing was his family and not food?\" \"Well for an Ubekian Cutworm, sometimes they are one and the same. But that's not for you to decide!\" \"Is there a problem?\" asked Rogan. She’d doubled back to find them. \"Nope, no problem,\" said Tuner, giving Jack a cheerful slap on the back. \"Just a mild case of culture shock, that's all.\" And so they'd continued through the bustling, drizzly streets. Jack did his absolute best to avoid making eye contact with anyone, let alone conversation. Then they'd turned off into a set of quieter, darker alleys, and now, only a quarter of an hour after leaving their ship, there was barely any sign of life at all… save for the cold glimmer of what looked suspiciously like eyes watching them from the shadows. As Jack said, it seemed like a really bad place to get lost. \"Is there a reason why there's nobody else hanging out around here? Like, maybe a reason why we shouldn't be here either?\" Clumps of wet newspaper gathered in the gutters. Old, stocky monitors hissed out rolling pictures of monochrome static. Street lamps spluttered on and off, showering the dark puddles with white and orange sparks. Alien graffiti had been scrawled across the walls and metal shutters. \"Oh, there are plenty of reasons,\" said Rogan, taking them down yet another dark and empty alley. This one was even more narrow than the last. \"Junk raiders, for starters. But unfortunately this is the only place that offers what we came for. Don't worry. I'm told it's nicer once we get there.\" \"I sure hope so,\" Jack mumbled. The rickety balcony above them rattled as a rabid critter took flight. \"So what is it you came here to get, exactly?\" \"A way out.\" Rogan splashed through a puddle. Jack wondered if any of the automata ever caught rust. \"There's a small rogue planet called Detri, way out in Dark Space where nobody tends to go. They say it's a place where our kind can be left to live in peace, where we needn't worry about fleshies putting us to work. A planet of our own to call home. A planet where we can be free.\" Rogan stopped and spun around. \"That's a story told from automata to automata. Many of us don't believe it even exists, but it does. I've seen the map files.\" She stepped closer to Jack. \"I hope I don't have to explain the importance of you keeping this information to yourself.\" Jack held up his hands. \"Hey. Your secret's safe with me. Who would I even tell?\" Rogan turned around and carried on down the alley. \"So what are you trying to buy here?\" asked Jack, hurrying after her. \"Safe passage to this Detri place?\" \"Wouldn't be much of a secret sanctuary if any of you fleshy pilots knew where it was, would it?\" she replied. Tuner laughed. \"No. Nothing so straight forward, unfortunately.\" \"The subspace route to Detri is an old one,\" said Tuner. \"Nobody really uses it anymore.\" \"Subspace route?\" \"They’re like shortcuts between systems,\" Rogan explained. \"Ships with top-of-the-line skip drives can go wherever they please, but cheaper models like ours have to stick to the interstellar highways.\" \"Ah. Sounds like a pretty good place for a hiding spot then,\" said Jack. \"Indeed… except that the Negoti Corporation bought the entire planetary system it goes through. Now they use that route as their own private shipping channel, sending the Somnium crystals they mine back out to the rest of the galaxy. Nobody gets through the Ceros Gate without the right clearance codes.\" \"And you can't just… fly around it?\" Rogan scoffed at the idea. \"Fly around a whole system? Do you think we're made of fuel or something? We've barely got enough to make the trip as it is.\" \"Besides, we'll have the codes.\" Tuner sounded proud of himself. \"There's a black market trader, goes by the name of Len Kroll. He deals with loads of dodgy smugglers, so he's got access codes and fake licenses spilling out of his ears. I reached out and made a deal with him before we escaped.\" \"Oh yeah? And what sort of deal would that be?\" Jack fell behind the two robots. Wait. Was he the deal, somehow? \"No offence, but neither of you strike me as the particularly affluent type. You don't have pockets, let alone purses.\" Tuner's finger transformed into a three-pronged interface. \"The most valuable resource isn't money, Jack,\" he said. \"It's information. Charon is working on something big out there. Real big – and real powerful, too. No automata is allowed access to the full set of schematics – only those for the section they’re working on – but I snatched what I could from his central servers. It's not worth as much as a full blueprint, but it's more than enough to buy us some security clearance.\" \"I bet this Charon guy was really happy about that.\" \"Pfft.\" Tuner waved his hand and the interface retracted again. \"He doesn't even know I took it.\" \"Tuner? Jack?\" Rogan beckoned them over from the other end of the alley. \"Come take a look. We're here.\" They hurried over and collectively peered around the corner. \"Tortaiga Square,\" announced Rogan, uneasily. The neon lights were back. So were the people. In the centre of what may have once been an ornate public square stood a circular bar at which patrons of various species drank from mugs and smoked from bottle-pipes. An automata with numerous dents in its chassis served them all from behind its counter, scooping up credits and dodging the occasional drunken projectile. Pubs, bars and other questionable establishments occupied every inch of the surrounding dilapidated buildings. Fire escapes groaned under the weight of their merry occupants. Signs on the fritz advertised cheap drinks and even cheaper company. Scantily-clad aliens danced in the upper windows. Electronic music blared out from a dozen different clubs. Streams of fairy lights and banners hung from one walkway to another. A fight broke out between two humanoid men a few floors up. The first man threw a few hard punches – none of which hit their intended target – and then the second tossed him over the balcony railing. He landed in the hard dirt with a sharp crack. Nobody paid his corpse much attention, save for the poor janitorial automata that hurried out to drag it away. \"Oh, this place is charming,\" said Jack. \"Let's not hang about,\" said Rogan. \"Do you know where you're going, Tuner?\" \"Kroll's got an office on the third floor.\" Tuner scanned the balconies. \"There it is – up there.\" He pointed up at a thick metal door on their right. A squat, grumpy-looking toad-alien in spacer-rags stood guard outside, clutching a rifle and glaring at passersby. A small, black sign hung from the wall. Tuner must have been told to look for the circular insignia when arranging the deal. \"Okay. Make it quick.\" She grabbed Tuner's arm as he went to leave. \"And be safe, all right? If something seems off, just leave. We'll find another way.\" \"Are we not going with him?\" asked Jack. \"I thought you said the people round here would sell a stray automata for parts.\" Tuner shook his head. \"Kroll said to come alone,\" he replied. \"Don't worry. I can handle myself.\" He made a few sharp but unconvincing chopping motions with his arms. Rogan sighed. \"Come meet us inside the archive when you're done,\" she said, before letting him hurry off towards the nearest flight of stairs. He was soon lost amongst the clouds of steam that rose from the vents beneath their feet. \"Is he going to be okay?\" asked Jack. \"He'll have to be,\" said Rogan, turning back to him. Her face looked grave. \"If we don't get those codes, we're done for. Now, then – how about we find out where this planet of yours is?\"",

      "content": "8 Library of the Ancients The archive stood over on the other side of the square, beyond the bars and the rabble of their patrons. Even though the buildings surrounding it were hardly modern by Kapamentis’ standards, it was clear that this one was much, much older. The entrance lay at the top of a wide set of steps littered with rubbish, flanked by classical pillars that were chipped and vandalised. The traders hauling carts up and down the streets paid it no attention. \"I'm surprised this place is still standing,\" said Jack, stepping over a smashed bottle. \"The people round here don't seem like the reading type.\" Rogan laughed. \"They can trash the halls all they want,\" she said, \"but none of those drunks could ever break the servers. Not with their arsenal, at least. Besides, even pirates and raiders need to find out where they're going every now and again.\" \"It's incredible,\" said Jack, marvelling at the juxtaposition between its classical stonework and the industrial metal of the neighbouring cityscape. \"Wait until you see inside.\" Rogan pushed the doors. They opened with a long and laboured creak. Jack stepped through into darkness and waited for his eyes to adjust. All he could make out were the tattered, dusty remains of a carpet at his feet. \"Should be here somewhere…\" said Rogan, lingering in the doorway as she fiddled inside an electrical panel. \"There – got it.\" A spark danced across the circuit breaker. Row by row, the dim, red lights of the archive bloomed to life. \"Woah,\" said Jack. More columns stood inside the hall. Each was a dozen or so metres in height and boasted a circumference wider than Jack’s arm span. Only one had collapsed – it now lay as a pile of dusty white rocks in the corner. The rest ran in rows towards a large reception desk at the other end of the hall – the threadbare carpet beneath Jack's feet must have guided scores of erudite guests towards it, once upon a time. From either side of the reception rose the two wings of a curved staircase, leading to the balcony and halls above. Large bronze statues of slender, academic-looking aliens in grand robes stood in nooks along the walls. The dramatic lighting made everything look as if it had been painted in blood. \"If only we could have seen this place in its heyday.\" Rogan frowned at the garbage and graffiti. \"There was once a time when Kapamentis was full of these archives – Libraries, they called them. Held every known secret in the universe within their walls.\" \"What happened to them?\" \"One day the race that built them were here, the next they were gone.\" Rogan shrugged. \"Nobody really knows. Some say they were wiped out. Others that they all just upped sticks and left the galaxy. Come on. The data terminals should be further ahead somewhere.\" Jack followed Rogan through the empty hall. He glanced over his shoulder at the open door behind them. Nobody appeared to have followed them inside. A small rodent squeaked and scampered into a crack in the wall as they reached the stairs. They passed the bronze statues on their way up. Even in death, Jack felt like they were judging him. The floor above was no less deserted, and no less derelict. Part of the roof had collapsed. For a moment Jack thought he saw a tiny moon up in the night sky. Then another drifted out from behind it, and he realised they were only the large, spherical space stations he'd seen in orbit, reflecting back the ghastly, ghostly light of the city. \"Keep up, Jack. Tuner could be back with the codes any minute. We mustn't dawdle.\" He followed Rogan down a broad and equally red-lit corridor lined with magnetically-sealed doors. Most had been broken into. The halls on the other side lay barren and ransacked. Glass cases were smashed and the floors covered in detritus. Whatever treasures the Library once held had long since been stolen. Something reflective on the floor caught his eye. He bent down and picked it up. It was some kind of bottle cap, discarded amongst a dozen spent rifle cartridges. He turned it over in his hand, watching as the faux-moonlight turned it from blue to silver, then ran a gloved thumb over it. Flat. Smooth like a pebble on both sides. Jack shrugged and pocketed it. He had to go back to Earth with something to show for himself, after all. He hurried after Rogan. \"Here they are.\" She gestured towards the hall ahead of them. \"Now all we need to do is find a console that’s still operational. Shouldn’t be too hard.\" Jack wasn't sure what he was looking for. A quartet of computer terminals formed a square in the centre of the dark room, facing inwards. More lined the exterior walls, though these, like the room itself, were in a far worse state of disrepair. Part of the easterly wall had fallen away completely. Rainwater poured through the damage, as did the occasional flash of headlights from passing cruisers. He peered out over the rubble, holding onto the remains of the wall with one hand and shielding his eyes from the rain with the other. Patrons staggered home from bars through the streets below. Traders pushed their stock towards the market. If he strained his eyes he could just make out the lights of Tortaiga Square further down. It was much easier to hear it than see it, even with the steady rumble of ships passing overhead. \"This one,\" said Rogan. \"It’s a bit busted, but it’ll do.\" She pressed a button on the front of one of the consoles. A flickering blue hologram about the size of Jack's living room wall burst up from the table next to it. It displayed a spinning, two-dimensional logo for a second, then glitched and vanished again. A smaller hologram shaped like a keyboard beamed out towards Rogan shortly afterwards. She frantically typed in a set of coordinates. The larger hologram returned when she finished. This time it showed a small, rather featureless planet. \"Detri,\" she whispered. \"Is this it?\" asked Jack, joining her at the console. \"Is this the planet you guys are headed for?\" Rogan nodded. Jack could see the desperate glisten of hope and awe in her eyes. He'd never felt so moved by something artificial before. It was almost as if she were… well, human. \"Way out in Dark Space, far from any fleshy colonies.\" She reached out to touch the hologram. Her fingers passed through the shimmering light without resistance. \"It's not much, but it's home. Or it could be.\" \"How would you live out there?\" Jack studied the planet as the hologram rotated at a snail's pace. \"I don't see any cities or settlements. Or is this entry out of date?\" Rogan smiled. \"Who knows how old this log is?\" she laughed. \"Tens of thousands of years, probably. But that's not why we can't see any automata cities on the surface. There aren't any. They're all on the inside.\" \"The inside?\" \"Yes.\" Rogan gave him a cheeky wink. \"It's a dead planet. The sanctuary is built within Detri's core. That's why nobody's ever found it.\" Jack felt his heart drop. \"And you're sure it's there, are you? You're sure it's not just a story?\" Rogan's face fell. For somebody made of metal she looked awfully young and afraid. \"Why would we speak of it in whispers if it weren't true?\" she replied. \"You're right,\" he said, waving his question away. \"I'm sorry. I'm getting homesick for my own planet, that's all. Budge up and let me have a go.\" Rogan stood aside so Jack could approach the holographic keyboard. As with the signs and billboards of the streets outside, the translation chip rearranged the alien letters and symbols into English. He typed in a single word: Earth. No results came up. \"That doesn't mean it isn't in there,\" said Rogan, noticing the panic plastered across Jack’s face. \"Different cultures have different names for the same planets. It could be that everyone knows it as something else.\" \"How am I supposed to know what name everyone else gives Earth,\" he asked, throwing his hands in the air, \"if nobody knows what or where Earth is in the first place?\" \"A fair point. Perhaps searching for a specific planet is the wrong approach to take. What's your system called?\" Jack wracked his brains. \"The Solar System?\" he suggested. \"Good grief. You humans – not a particularly imaginative lot, are you?\" Jack waited with his stomach doing somersaults while Rogan contemplated a new strategy in silence. \"How many planets are in this Solar System of yours?\" Jack gave this some thought. It wasn't as easy a question to answer as it should have been. \"Well… eight, technically,\" he replied, scratching the back of his neck. \"Nine if you include Pluto. But if you include Pluto then you have to count the other dwarf planets too, which brings the total up to thirteen. I think. A couple of them are still disputed.\" Rogan sighed. \"Out of the eight main ones, do you know which order they go in? In terms of rocky and gaseous worlds, I mean.\" \"Sure,\" said Jack, cautiously. \"There are the rocky inner planets – oh, and then the asteroid belt – and then the gas giants, the ice giants…\" \"There you go, then!\" said Rogan, gesturing towards the keyboard. \"Enter all that information into the machine – every variation of every detail you can think of. Do it!\" Jack typed as many variables as he could into the computer. A second after he pressed Enter, the hologram brought up a floating diorama of a solar system. His heart fluttered. \"Is that it?\" asked Rogan. Jack looked closer, then shook his head. \"It looks right at first glance, but it's not the same. See the fourth planet from the sun, there? It's way too large. Mars is smaller than Earth, not bigger. And the orbits of the seventh and eighth planets are far too close together.\" \"Have another go. Maybe you missed something.\" This time the hologram showed a different solar system – one with only two inner planets, even though the four outer giants looked much the same. \"That's not right either.\" Jack grew forlorn. \"Are you sure this thing has maps of every system in the galaxy? What if I’m not even in the Milky Way anymore?\" \"Keep trying.\" Rogan peered down the corridor towards the stairs. \"What's taking Tuner so long? I thought he'd be back with us by now.\" Jack thought back to his old science lessons and added every little detail he could remember, yet time and time again the console would conjure a solar system that was not quite right. The wrong placement of an asteroid belt, or twin suns instead of one. He didn't recognise any of the names the console showed him, either – though unless it said Earth, he didn't expect to. \"This is hopeless,\" he sighed after entering his eleventh iteration of data. \"The Solar System isn't in here. I guess it makes sense. How could anyone have a map of us if nobody's ever heard of humans before?\" \"Unlikely,\" replied Rogan, still on the lookout for Tuner. \"They mapped the—\" She was interrupted by the crack of a gunshot outside. Terror dashed across Rogan’s face. She sprinted to the rain-sodden hole in the wall and peered down at the street below. Jack followed quickly after. \"Oh no,\" she whispered. One of the traders lay face-down in the filthy street, a wisp of smoke rising from the hole in her back. Beside her corpse stood a man in oil-stained rags. He looked mortified. The stocky beast pulling their cart had bolted from the gunshot, spilling credits and engine parts everywhere. Somebody was talking to the terrified man, but Jack couldn't hear them above the storm. Neither could he see any figures standing amongst the shadows. Then a billboard on the building across the street switched one advert out for another, and the whole scene was bathed in stark blue light. Jack gasped. A tall, gaunt figure in a long, burgundy robe stood a couple of metres away from the traders. He looked almost human, albeit one dug up after a few decades under the earth. His dark eyes sank deep into his pale, waxy skull. His cheeks were so thin they were almost translucent. He tapped the knuckles on each hand with long, bony fingers that moved like stalks of corn waving in the wind. Three ratty, canine creatures guarded him. They stood upright and wore patchwork armour made of scrap metal and leather. That was about as sophisticated as they got. Their bodies were covered in matted hair and they snarled with long, salivating jaws. Jack put their height at about six foot, which put their lanky boss closer to seven. Each had a chunky battle-scarred rifle clutched in its clawed hands. Rogan scurried backwards out of sight. \"Friends of yours, I take it?\" Jack kept his voice to a whisper. \"Wait – is the tall one down there that Charon guy you were telling me about?\" Rogan shook her head. The apertures of her eye lenses were wide. If Jack hadn't known she was made of metal, he would have sworn she was shaking. \"That's Gaskan Troi.\" She took another peek around the wall. \"Charon’s right hand man and all-round grim piece of work. I once saw him disassemble an automata just for fitting a superconductor wrong. Charon put him in charge of the Iris project we were working on. You see those beasts lurking beside him?\" \"Pretty hard to miss them.\" \"They’re Rakletts. They're as stupid as they are ugly – just as vicious, too.\" \"Gaskan Troi,\" said Jack, savouring the alien name. \"Well, better for a lackey to come after you than his boss – right?\" Alarmed, Rogan shook her head. \"Charon might be cold and calculating, but at least it's for a purpose,\" she replied. \"Gaskan Troi is cruel for fun.\" A second gunshot rang out. Jack took another look outside. One of the snarling Raskett guards had fired his rifle into the air. If the intention was to frighten the surviving trader into talking, it worked. He pointed down the street towards Tortaiga Square with a trembling finger. Gaskan bowed towards the man in gratitude… and then had one of the other Raklett guards shoot him in the head. \"Christ Almighty,\" said Jack, ducking back into cover. His chest heaved up and down. \"Well, at least they're headed away from here.\" \"Yes, but did you see where that man was pointing?\" hissed Rogan. \"They're headed right for the square – to Tuner! That sleaze-bag Kroll double-crossed us!\" \"Or maybe you're worrying over nothing,\" said Jack, desperate to calm her down. \"I mean, ask yourself this… what would this Kroll guy have to gain from turning in one little automata? It's probably just a coincidence they're here… right?\" \"It's not Tuner that Gaskan cares about.\" Rogan grew even more agitated. \"I doubt he cares about getting any of us back, actually. It's the blueprints in Tuner's head that Gaskan's after. Kroll could make a fortune selling them on the black market… but he could continue breathing if he hands them back to Charon.\" She watched the lackey and his ratty, skittish guards march down the street. \"We've got to get Tuner out of there,\" she said, pulling Jack to his feet. \"They clearly don't know Kroll's exact address yet. Maybe we can get to him before they do.\" \"Hold on a damn second.\" Jack backed away from her. \"I'm no hero. You saw those guns, right? You saw the freaks wielding them? No thanks. Besides, you automata are going your own way after this – your captain made that very clear. You go rescue your friend. I'll stay here and try to find a way back home.\" \"Don't you dare be such a coward,\" she snapped. Jack was taken aback. He didn't know what to say. \"My friend – the little box of bolts who saved your life, remember – needs our help. You're going to help me break him out of that trap whether you want to or not. You owe him that. And if you don't, I'll tear out your translator chip and turn off all the power to this place on my way out. Have fun getting back to your planet without a tongue or a map.\" Jack stared at her. Was she joking? Rogan glared back at him, so furious he could almost hear the metal plates of her face grinding together. He really didn't think she was joking. \"Okay,\" he said, raising his hands in mock surrender. \"Lead the way.\"",

      "content": "8 Library of the Ancients The archive stood over on the other side of the square, beyond the bars and the rabble of their patrons. Even though the buildings surrounding it were hardly modern by Kapamentis’ standards, it was clear that this one was much, much older. The entrance lay at the top of a wide set of steps littered with rubbish, flanked by classical pillars that were chipped and vandalised. The traders hauling carts up and down the streets paid it no attention. \"I'm surprised this place is still standing,\" said Jack, stepping over a smashed bottle. \"The people round here don't seem like the reading type.\" Rogan laughed. \"They can trash the halls all they want,\" she said, \"but none of those drunks could ever break the servers. Not with their arsenal, at least. Besides, even pirates and raiders need to find out where they're going every now and again.\" \"It's incredible,\" said Jack, marvelling at the juxtaposition between its classical stonework and the industrial metal of the neighbouring cityscape. \"Wait until you see inside.\" Rogan pushed the doors. They opened with a long and laboured creak. Jack stepped through into darkness and waited for his eyes to adjust. All he could make out were the tattered, dusty remains of a carpet at his feet. \"Should be here somewhere…\" said Rogan, lingering in the doorway as she fiddled inside an electrical panel. \"There – got it.\" A spark danced across the circuit breaker. Row by row, the dim, red lights of the archive bloomed to life. \"Woah,\" said Jack. More columns stood inside the hall. Each was a dozen or so metres in height and boasted a circumference wider than Jack’s arm span. Only one had collapsed – it now lay as a pile of dusty white rocks in the corner. The rest ran in rows towards a large reception desk at the other end of the hall – the threadbare carpet beneath Jack's feet must have guided scores of erudite guests towards it, once upon a time. From either side of the reception rose the two wings of a curved staircase, leading to the balcony and halls above. Large bronze statues of slender, academic-looking aliens in grand robes stood in nooks along the walls. The dramatic lighting made everything look as if it had been painted in blood. \"If only we could have seen this place in its heyday.\" Rogan frowned at the garbage and graffiti. \"There was once a time when Kapamentis was full of these archives – Libraries, they called them. Held every known secret in the universe within their walls.\" \"What happened to them?\" \"One day the race that built them were here, the next they were gone.\" Rogan shrugged. \"Nobody really knows. Some say they were wiped out. Others that they all just upped sticks and left the galaxy. Come on. The data terminals should be further ahead somewhere.\" Jack followed Rogan through the empty hall. He glanced over his shoulder at the open door behind them. Nobody appeared to have followed them inside. A small rodent squeaked and scampered into a crack in the wall as they reached the stairs. They passed the bronze statues on their way up. Even in death, Jack felt like they were judging him. The floor above was no less deserted, and no less derelict. Part of the roof had collapsed. For a moment Jack thought he saw a tiny moon up in the night sky. Then another drifted out from behind it, and he realised they were only the large, spherical space stations he'd seen in orbit, reflecting back the ghastly, ghostly light of the city. \"Keep up, Jack. Tuner could be back with the codes any minute. We mustn't dawdle.\" He followed Rogan down a broad and equally red-lit corridor lined with magnetically-sealed doors. Most had been broken into. The halls on the other side lay barren and ransacked. Glass cases were smashed and the floors covered in detritus. Whatever treasures the Library once held had long since been stolen. Something reflective on the floor caught his eye. He bent down and picked it up. It was some kind of bottle cap, discarded amongst a dozen spent rifle cartridges. He turned it over in his hand, watching as the faux-moonlight turned it from blue to silver, then ran a gloved thumb over it. Flat. Smooth like a pebble on both sides. Jack shrugged and pocketed it. He had to go back to Earth with something to show for himself, after all. He hurried after Rogan. \"Here they are.\" She gestured towards the hall ahead of them. \"Now all we need to do is find a console that’s still operational.

      "content": "9 Rakletts, Raiders & Rescue Tuner waited in Kroll’s office. It was remarkably cozy compared to the scrap heap bustle of Tortaiga Square outside. He was sat in a plush, ruby-coloured armchair in front of a great wooden desk adorned with small, valuable and quite probably illegal artefacts. The dusty cloth of an old tribal banner blanketed one of the walls. An archaic lampshade in the corner of the small room cast everything in a dim orange glow. Kroll sat on the other side of the desk. Like the guard who stood outside his door, Kroll was a stout, amphibious, toad-like creature that appeared to melt into his chair as much as sit in it. He wore padded leather clothes and sported a semi-permanent monocular eyepiece with which he could inspect illicit goods. He was studying such an item now. The lenses of his eyepiece clicked as they increased their degree of magnification. His fingers holding the small, speckled orb trembled. \"Not too much longer, I hope,\" said Tuner, swinging his little metal legs back and forth over the edge of the armchair. It had been twenty minutes already. A bead of sweat rolled down from Kroll’s bulbous scalp. He checked the data pad on his forearm and grunted. \"Yes, my assistant should be back with your codes any minute now.\" Kroll nodded towards the reinforced door behind him. He looked as anxious to complete the deal as Tuner. \"How about you hand over the blueprints while we wait?\" Tuner shook his head and crossed his arms. \"Not until I download the codes.\" \"Suit yourself,\" Kroll grumbled. He went back to his inspections. * * * Jack and Rogan pushed through the crowded square, trying hard not to spill anybody's drink. A few automata-phobic insults were thrown after them, but most patrons were too drunk to even notice. Gaskan Troi and his Raklett troops were nowhere to be seen. \"Where was the office?\" Rogan searched the storeys of bars and brothels above with frightened eyes. \"Can you see it?\" \"There,\" said Jack, pointing at Kroll's establishment. \"The one with the black symbol on the wall and the, erm, frog-thing at the door.\" \"Come on.\" Rogan grabbed Jack’s hand and dragged him towards the nearest flight of metal stairs. They rattled like the ladders of a fire escape. Jack tried not to look down and ignored the strange sounds that drifted out from each floor they passed. Kroll's guard watched them approach with an ill-tempered look on her face. \"Let us through,\" said Rogan, marching up to the door. \"Our friend is in there.\" \"I'm sure he is,\" she grunted. \"But you ain't going in there. Not 'less the boss says so.\" \"We won't be any trouble,\" said Jack. He reached for the door handle. \"We just need to make sure he's—\" Something hit the side of his head hard. He crashed down on the iron walkway and a metallic taste filled his mouth. \"What the…?\" He raised a finger to his lips. When he pulled it away again, it was speckled with blood. \"That green freak hit me!\" The amphibious guard lowered the muzzle of her rifle so that it pointed directly at Jack's head. \"This green freak is about to do a whole lot worse than that,\" she said, aiming down the sights. Rogan grabbed the guard’s head and smashed it against the wall of Kroll's office in a single, effortless motion. Jack didn’t even catch a blur, she was so quick. The guard went limp and dropped to the floor. Rogan flexed her double-jointed fingers. \"Oh, yeah.\" Jack climbed back onto his feet. \"You really needed my help, didn't you?\" \"Shut up,\" said Rogan, kicking open the front door. \"And stay shut up this time,\" she added. A small reception room lay on the other side. Jack expected to find more security, but they only encountered a small, many-armed insectoid who was either Kroll's accountant or personal assistant, judging by the paperwork the poor spectacled creature had piled up on its desk. It shrieked indecipherable protestations at them as they crossed over to the only other door in the room. Rogan leaned her head against it, then nodded. \"Sounds quiet in there,\" she whispered. \"Hopefully that's a good sign. Ready?\" Jack glanced back at the indignant insectoid glaring at them from behind the reception desk. \"Absolutely not,\" he replied. \"Three… two… one…\" She threw the door open and charged in. Kroll scrambled back from his desk. \"Who, in all of Kapamentis, are you?\" Tuner turned around in his chair. His LED eyes lit up. \"Rogan? Jack! I thought you were going to wait over in the archive?\" He started to get off the chair, then hesitated. \"Sorry for the delay,\" he added sheepishly. \"Mr Kroll's assistant should be here with the codes any time now. I’m not sure what’s taking so long.\" \"Come with us, you idiot!\" Rogan grabbed Tuner and wrenched him out of his seat. \"We're in the middle of a goddamn ambush!\" \"Hurry up, guys,\" said Jack, darting back to the exit to check it was still clear. \"I don't see anyone coming, but…\" \"An ambush?\" asked Tuner, confused. He looked back towards Kroll's bulbous expression of panic as Rogan dragged him out the door. \"But what about the codes?\" \"Screw the codes,\" she said, struggling to pull him any further. \"We'll find another—\" The reinforced door behind Len Kroll slammed open, cutting Rogan off. Four sets of eyes peered from Kroll's storage room – three sets yellow, and one set twice as black as the gloom from which they glared. The Raklett guards drooled and growled from inside the doorway, but it was the skeletal Gaskan Troi that stepped through first. He pointed a thin, accusatory finger at the two automata. \"Get them!\" he screeched. The Raklett guards opened fire. Their plasma rifles tore Kroll's office apart as if its metal walls were made of paper. Gaskan didn't so much as flinch at the chaos erupting around him. Kroll, on the other hand, dived under his desk with a wounded howl. Rogan had been right. Gaskan didn't care about recapturing the robots, only in making sure the blueprints in Tuner's head didn't fall into the wrong hands. Jack was first out the door. Rogan followed with Tuner forcibly in tow. Kroll's terrified accountant tried leaping to freedom, but a stray plasma bolt burst through one wall and splattered it against the other. Jack nearly went racing over the walkway's rickety railing when they got outside. Rogan grabbed hold of his spacesuit and threw him in the direction of the stairs. \"Run!\" It wasn't as if Jack had much else planned. He swung himself round the corner and leapt down the steps two at a time. When Rogan caught up, she was carrying Tuner in her arms. His little legs weren't fast enough. The Rakletts stormed out of the office and stumbled across the toad-guard's unconscious body. One of them peered over the railing and caught sight of the three escapees hurrying down the stairs. A plasma round blew apart the sign beside Jack’s head. Sparks fell over him like a golden snowfall. He snapped his head up, saw one of the Rakletts aiming its rifle at him, and dropped to the floor just in time. The drunk patron beside him erupted into a red paste. Rogan and Tuner hurried past without stopping. Jack flung himself towards the next flight down. He stopped short as another plasma round burned a hole in the floor by his feet. He peered through it at the level below. \"Hey, wait up!\" Rogan and Tuner – now back on his own two feet – were already at the bottom of the stairwell and looking for a way across the square. It was too open to make a run for it, despite the crowds. Rakletts were no sharpshooters, but it isn't hard to hit a moving target when you don't care about the collateral around it. Lucky for them – if you need something in Kapamentis, you can always find it. Even if what you're looking for is an exit. Jack didn’t know if what happened next was the natural evolution of a Tortaiga Square evening or the result of the Rakletts turning one too many regulars into a red mist. Whatever the reason, patron after patron snatched the sidearm from their holster and fired back at the balcony, peppering it with lasers and lead. Many drank from a bottle in their other hand as they did so. It sure wasn't in defence of either him or the automata – that much was clear from the corpses of bar brawls and dents in the robotic bartenders. By the bloodthirsty expressions on their scarred faces, Jack reckoned they did it for the hell of it – as if it were a sport that, for just a moment, brought the whole Tortaiga community together. Not that he was complaining. The Raklett nearest the railing took the brunt of the onslaught, dancing a jitterbug as round after round tore through his scrappy, patchwork armour. He was dead before his matted, furry body hit the floor, by which time the other two had retreated back inside Kroll's office. The only way they were getting out was the same way they came in – the storage room round back. \"Now!\" gasped Jack, catching up with Rogan and Tuner at the bottom of the stairs. \"Quickly, while everyone's distracted!\" The three of them sprinted across the square, ignored by the drinkers still laughing – and shooting – at the dead Raklett lying on the walkway above. Pockets of fist-fights broke out here and there, instigated by those apparently not satisfied by the night's violence thus far. The bars dialled up the volume of their music and went back to business. Jack stopped to catch his breath when he reached the dark alley on the other side. Rogan and Tuner continued running past him. They didn't have lungs to refill. He staggered after them, telling himself that he wouldn't be so worn out if it weren't for him wearing such a bulky spacesuit. The revelry of Tortaiga Square faded behind them. For a brief while the only sound was of their feet splashing through the puddles of the dark and empty alleys. Then, only a couple dozen metres from where the shadows of the alley met the neon circus of the market, Rogan stopped dead in her tracks. Tuner fell onto his side. Jack almost ran into the back of her. \"What are you doing?\" Jack’s words came out in a wheeze. \"We're in a bottleneck. This is the absolute worst place to stop!\" Rogan continued to stare at the darkest, most dingy corner of the passageway. \"Why don't you tell them that?\" she whispered. Three lanky figures crept out from the shadows. Jack gasped. For a moment he thought they were human. But then he noticed they had only three fingers and a thumb on each hand, and when they grinned their teeth were sharp and far too numerous. He felt his stomach twist. They looked starving, not least because of the hungry look they gave Rogan. They stalked towards her, step by tiny step. The further they left the shadows, the more their scrappy wasteland clothes were revealed. The light from passing cruisers splashed across their chunky black goggles. So he had seen eyes in the darkness before. Jack looked back the way they came. Nobody was coming after them… yet. \"What are they?\" whispered Jack. \"Raiders from the Dust Belt,\" replied Rogan. She didn’t take her eyes off them. \"They'll tear out our cores and break our bodies down for scrap.\" There was no other way out the alley. Nor could Jack see anything he could use as a weapon – nothing more effective than a soggy cardboard box, anyway. The only way forward was… well, forward. He had an idea. It just wasn't a very good one. \"How smart are these creeps?\" he asked. \"They know their way around a wrench pretty well.\" There was a note of concern in her voice. \"But in general terms, they're quite thick.\" \"Well, it's worth a try.\" \"What is?\" Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the bottle cap he'd pilfered from the Library. He pinched it between his finger and thumb and hesitantly raised it above his head. \"Stay b-back, or I'll use it,\" he said, stumbling over his words. An alarmed bleeping noise came from beside him. \"What are you doing, Jack?\" said Tuner. \"That's a…\" \"I know what it is,\" Jack hissed out the corner of his mouth. \"But they don't.\" The raiders snarled and edged back into the shadow, their hands held out in front and their heads bowed. The path to the market was clear. \"Come on, guys.\" Jack ushered the automata towards the exit. \"Let's go before they realise what I'm holding.\" \"Oh, I think they realise what you're holding just as much as we do,\" said Rogan, staring at Jack with wide, frightened lenses. They inched towards the sights and sounds of the market. \"I'm not running until you either throw that thing or put it away.\" \"Throw it?\" A cold veil of panic draped over him. \"Why would I throw a bottle cap?\" \"Because it's not a bottle cap,\" said Tuner, \"and it is a grenade.\" \"What?\" \"Yes! Looks like a small plasma model. Won't do too much damage, but it'll take your arm off easily enough.\" Suddenly Jack’s arm felt incredibly heavy. \"Like hell am I putting it back in my pocket, then!\" With their backs to the bustling market stalls, they could barely hear themselves whisper. The raiders, sensing Jack's hesitation, started to creep forward again. \"Then throw it!\" said Tuner, waving his arms around. He hopped from foot to foot. \"It goes off when it hits something hard and fast.\" \"Where in the world did you find a grenade anyway?\" Rogan whacked him in the ribs. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"I thought it was a bottle cap!\" \"Throw it!\" Jack shut his eyes and lobbed it. It flew through the air and landed in a puddle by the raiders' feet. It fizzled pathetically. The raiders looked back up at the automata and grinned. \"Run?\" said Jack. \"Run!\" shouted Rogan. They turned and sprinted into the crowded market. Jack tried not to lose sight of Rogan. Tuner, because of his smaller size, was too easy to miss. He recognised some of the signs and vendors as he pushed his way through the throng of aliens and automata, but he knew he had no chance of finding his way back to the spaceport without them. He also knew he wasn't welcome on the Adeona, but he had nowhere else to go. Every now and then he glanced back through the crowd, expecting to see the raiders right behind him. But if they were, he couldn't see them. He guessed they didn't like the bright lights and loud noise of the market. Perhaps that’s why they kept to the dark alleys. \"Rogan? Tuner?\" They heard him and slowed down. \"It's all right. I don't think we're being chased anymore.\" Rogan peered above everybody’s heads. She nodded. \"Okay. The port is that way.\" She pointed further down the street. \"Come on, Tuner. Let's get back to the ship.\" \"What about the codes?\" Tuner asked. \"How will we get through the blockade?\" \"We'll find another way.\" She shot Jack a sharp look as if to say: don't say a word. They went to leave. But before they could, a large and angry grub blocked their path. \"Well, well, well,\" it said in a loud, grumbling voice. \"Look who it is.\" Jack raised his head towards the Ubekian Cutworm whose daughter he'd insulted. Towards its pair of snapping mandibles, to be exact. Rainwater dripped off them onto Jack’s upturned face. \"Oh God. Please, not now.\" Rogan and Tuner edged away, leaving Jack to face the giant grub alone. But the Cutworm moved its hindquarters to block them, too. \"Where do you think you're going?\" it said, grinning. \"You seem to be in an awful hurry. Two little automata, all on their own…\" It studied Jack with transparent disgust. \"Alone except for this ugly creature. Could be that somebody's looking for you, yes? Could even be that there's a reward for bringing you in.\" The Cutworm nodded its corpulent head down a street perpendicular to their own. The two surviving Rakletts were headed in their direction, ransacking stalls and harassing their owners. Gaskan Troi followed in their destructive wake. He stopped and asked each of the terrified vendors the same question. A hologram hovered above a small, circular pad in his hand. Jack could guess what it showed: Rogan and Tuner. \"Now, I could bring them over here and claim that bounty,\" the Cutworm continued, \"or I could be minding my own business while the three of you slip by.\" \"How much are you after?\" asked Rogan, tapping her foot. Gaskan and his guards grew closer with every second. \"Ten thousand credits,\" said the Cutworm. He grabbed Jack and lifted him so that Jack’s face was only inches from his own. \"And this runt apologises to my daughter.\" Jack turned his head towards the grub’s stall. His daughter hadn’t moved from the corner. She was still excreting a weird, sticky substance down the side. \"I am so, so sorry.\" Jack turned back to her father. \"Honestly. I'm new around here. I don't know what I'm saying half the time. Please let us go.\" The Cutworm grunted and dropped Jack to the floor. It turned to face Rogan. \"And the credits?\" Rogan shrugged and shook her head. \"Ten thousand credits? We're automata. How in the galaxy would we have that sort of money?\" \"That's a shame. Your bounty's only worth half that much.\" The Cutworm rose up to its full height, teetering on its tiny pair of hind legs while the rest waggled in the air for balance. It towered above the rest of the crowd. \"Hey, you guys!\" it bellowed. \"Those bolt-buckets you're after – I've got 'em right here!\" \"Go!\" said Jack. \"Now’s our chance!\" With the Ubekian Cutworm standing upright, its body no longer blocked their way. The three of them ran through the gap. The bug was big, but it wasn't quick. It dropped back down with an earth-shuddering crash. \"Oi!\" The crowd reluctantly parted for them. Nobody wanted to get involved. They raced through as fast as they could, not daring to slow down – not even when the muscles in Jack's legs burned hot, or when his lungs turned dry and raspy. To stop meant death or dismantlement. The snarling Rakletts gave chase. They were slower than Jack and Rogan, but not Tuner… and they may well have caught him, had they been a little brighter. Instead, one of them tried to shoot him… and missed. The plasma round whizzed past Tuner's head and blew a hole in the chest of a poor, unsuspecting crowd member, who went crashing through the rickety wooden stand behind. The beams collapsed and knocked out a second customer. The market descended into chaos as people screamed and fled. The empty divide was lost. Still Jack ran. He could only pick out glimpses of Rogan amongst the flood of hysterical aliens. Sometimes all he had to go on was a hint of the cables that ran out from the back of her head. At one point he thought he'd lost her… only for Tuner to climb on top of her shoulders and wave to him. \"Jack!\" he screamed. \"This way!\" They were outside the entrance to the spaceport by the time Jack caught up with them. He never would have known it was there otherwise – from the ground, its enormous metal walls looked barely any different to those of the towers and skyscrapers everywhere else. \"Thanks for waiting,\" he said, gasping for air. \"Don't thank me.\" Rogan nodded at Tuner. \"He's the one who insists on being your guardian angel. I don't know why – you've been nothing but trouble since we landed.\" \"Hey, I saved your life back there!\" \"No, you almost blew us all up!\" Infuriated, she shook her head. \"It doesn't matter. Let's hurry. It won't be long before Gaskan works out this is where we're docked.\" \"If he hasn't already,\" said Tuner, quiet and scared. They sprinted through the port. Other ships were taking off in sharp fashion – nobody wanted to hang around in case a full-scale riot was on the cards. Clouds of dust blew across their path as massive thrusters roared into the earth. The sirens of police cruisers grew louder. \"There she is,\" yelled Rogan. The Adeona lay dead ahead. Her loading ramp still lolled open like a metal tongue. 11-P-53 stood at the bottom, watching in bafflement as they approached. \"What's going on out there?\" it asked. \"And what's he still doing here?\" \"No time to explain,\" said Rogan, pushing him back up the ramp. \"We need to take off now.\" \"Did you get the codes?\" \"No,\" said Tuner, \"we—\" \"What do you mean, no? Without them, we're—\" \"It was a trap, Captain.” Rogan grabbed and shook 11-P-53. \"Gaskan is coming after us. So unless your plan is to give yourself up, may I kindly suggest you get this ship in the air right now!\" There came an enormous rumble from the Adeona's engines, and the whole ship rattled as she rose from the ground. The loading ramp and the landing gear retracted with a mechanical grinding sound. \"Looks like she's doing it herself,\" said 11-P-53, hurrying up the stairs to the cockpit. Rogan gave one of the Adeona's supports an affectionate pat and then followed. Jack watched with a growing sense of dread as the ships in the port below got smaller and smaller. Then the ramp closed with a hollow clang. He doubled over, exhausted. Was he any closer to Earth? Or with each passing moment, was he only getting further away? * * * Ode Vadasz paid no more attention to the Adeona as it took off than he did to any other ship leaving the port. He didn't know what had caused all the commotion in the market, but it was about time he got clear of it too. He dropped his roll-up cigarette into the dirt and crushed the embers beneath his black leather boot. At a glance, Ode could have passed for human. He had short, dark hair, eyes with blue irises, the regular amount of fingers on each hand. Indeed, he could have wandered through the streets of Earth without anyone so much as batting an eye in his direction… so long as he kept his dusty cloak wrapped around his shoulders, that is. People may have noticed his outfit, however. He wore brown leather from head to toe, all of it stained by sun and sand. His home world had a lot of both. Perhaps he was due a trip back. Ode climbed the steps of his landing pad and approached his ship. The Black Arrow was small and personal – it seated two, though he rarely had any passengers – yet few who underestimated it did so twice. It was as quick as its name implied and three times as deadly… especially in the hands of a skilled pilot such as himself. He was about to climb into the cockpit when he heard raised voices on the path behind him. In any normal circumstance he wouldn’t have cared, but he had a good ear for opportunity. Two slobbering Rakletts were pointing plasma rifles at a rickety ship rising out of the port. One of them fired off a couple of shots, which inevitably missed their target and disappeared into the night instead. \"Give me that,\" said a gaunt and furious figure. He snatched the rifle out of the other Raklett's hands and shot his trigger-happy companion dead. \"Idiots!\" he screamed, slamming the rifle back into the arms of its owner. \"Cretins! How hard is it to catch a gaggle of rusty engineering units? I swear—\" \"You after that ship?\" asked Ode. He pointed up at the Adeona as it swung itself around to leave. \"Why?\" Gaskan snapped his head towards him. \"You some sort of bounty hunter?\" \"Among other things.\" \"Any good?\" Even from a position leaning against the Black Arrow with his arms crossed, Ode managed to unclip his handgun from its holster, shoot the surviving Raklett in the head and then re-holster his weapon, all before his target could so much as blink in protest. He was so quick, in fact, that he almost appeared not to uncross his arms at all. \"I figured you wouldn't miss him,\" said Ode, grinning. \"You figured right,\" said Gaskan, eyeing the corpse at his feet with tired disdain. He pulled a small bag of coins from his robe and tossed it in Ode's direction. \"That's five thousand credits. You'll get the same again when the job's done.\" Ode glanced up at the Adeona. She was still navigating her cumbersome way through the maze of skyscrapers surrounding the spaceport. It wouldn't be hard to catch up with her… but he needed to leave quick. \"Dead or alive?\" he asked, jumping into his cockpit. He tapped out a pattern on the data pad on his sleeve to sync comm details with Gaskan. \"Neither,\" replied Gaskan, sneering. \"They're automata, not people. But bring them back in one piece. I'd like to take them apart myself.\" Ode gave Gaskan a sharp nod and then yanked down his ship’s domed windshield. The Black Arrow rocketed off the landing pad as if it were no effort at all. He had no trouble tracking the Adeona. His own ship's holographic dashboard picked her up just before she passed through the storm clouds. She was headed for orbit and would no doubt jump to subspace soon after. He couldn't let her do that. But he couldn't shoot her down, either. Not yet, at least. Not while she was under the influence of Kapamentis' gravity. A breach of Ministry regulation like that would bring a lot of heat down on him. And aside from any collateral damage caused by crashing a ship inside the city, Ode still wanted those other five thousand credits. Not that he needed to worry. His ship was well-equipped for such a situation. The Black Arrow's tracking software kept him at a distance that wouldn't arouse suspicion. He followed his prey, waiting until she cleared the planet's atmosphere before he struck. He fired off a disrupter mine. It sped through the vacuum like a rocket and latched itself on to the outside of the Adeona's thrusters. The lights around the mine's rim flashed menacingly as it counted down to detonation. Ode counted down with them. Five… four… three… Moments before the mine could disable its engines, the Adeona skipped into subspace. One second she was there – the next, she seemed to have blinked out of existence. Ode grinned to himself. It didn't matter. A battered old ship like that couldn't get very far. All he had to do was follow the damage.",

      "content": "9 Rakletts, Raiders & Rescue Tuner waited in Kroll’s office. It was remarkably cozy compared to the scrap heap bustle of Tortaiga Square outside. He was sat in a plush, ruby-coloured armchair in front of a great wooden desk adorned with small, valuable and quite probably illegal artefacts. The dusty cloth of an old tribal banner blanketed one of the walls. An archaic lampshade in the corner of the small room cast everything in a dim orange glow. Kroll sat on the other side of the desk. Like the guard who stood outside his door, Kroll was a stout, amphibious, toad-like creature that appeared to melt into his chair as much as sit in it. He wore padded leather clothes and sported a semi-permanent monocular eyepiece with which he could inspect illicit goods. He was studying such an item now. The lenses of his eyepiece clicked as they increased their degree of magnification. His fingers holding the small, speckled orb trembled. \"Not too much longer, I hope,\" said Tuner, swinging his little metal legs back and forth over the edge of the armchair. It had been twenty minutes already. A bead of sweat rolled down from Kroll’s bulbous scalp. He checked the data pad on his forearm and grunted. \"Yes, my assistant should be back with your codes any minute now.\" Kroll nodded towards the reinforced door behind him. He looked as anxious to complete the deal as Tuner. \"How about you hand over the blueprints while we wait?\" Tuner shook his head and crossed his arms. \"Not until I download the codes.\" \"Suit yourself,\" Kroll grumbled. He went back to his inspections. * * * Jack and Rogan pushed through the crowded square, trying hard not to spill anybody's drink. A few automata-phobic insults were thrown after them, but most patrons were too drunk to even notice. Gaskan Troi and his Raklett troops were nowhere to be seen. \"Where was the office?\" Rogan searched the storeys of bars and brothels above with frightened eyes. \"Can you see it?\" \"There,\" said Jack, pointing at Kroll's establishment. \"The one with the black symbol on the wall and the, erm, frog-thing at the door.\" \"Come on.\" Rogan grabbed Jack’s hand and dragged him towards the nearest flight of metal stairs. They rattled like the ladders of a fire escape. Jack tried not to look down and ignored the strange sounds that drifted out from each floor they passed. Kroll's guard watched them approach with an ill-tempered look on her face. \"Let us through,\" said Rogan, marching up to the door. \"Our friend is in there.\" \"I'm sure he is,\" she grunted. \"But you ain't going in there. Not 'less the boss says so.\" \"We won't be any trouble,\" said Jack. He reached for the door handle. \"We just need to make sure he's—\" Something hit the side of his head hard. He crashed down on the iron walkway and a metallic taste filled his mouth. \"What the…?\" He raised a finger to his lips. When he pulled it away again, it was speckled with blood. \"That green freak hit me!\" The amphibious guard lowered the muzzle of her rifle so that it pointed directly at Jack's head. \"This green freak is about to do a whole lot worse than that,\" she said, aiming down the sights. Rogan grabbed the guard’s head and smashed it against the wall of Kroll's office in a single, effortless motion. Jack didn’t even catch a blur, she was so quick. The guard went limp and dropped to the floor. Rogan flexed her double-jointed fingers. \"Oh, yeah.\" Jack climbed back onto his feet. \"You really needed my help, didn't you?\" \"Shut up,\" said Rogan, kicking open the front door. \"And stay shut up this time,\" she added. A small reception room lay on the other side. Jack expected to find more security, but they only encountered a small, many-armed insectoid who was either Kroll's accountant or personal assistant, judging by the paperwork the poor spectacled creature had piled up on its desk. It shrieked indecipherable protestations at them as they crossed over to the only other door in the room. Rogan leaned her head against it, then nodded. \"Sounds quiet in there,\" she whispered. \"Hopefully that's a good sign. Ready?\" Jack glanced back at the indignant insectoid glaring at them from behind the reception desk. \"Absolutely not,\" he replied. \"Three… two… one…\" She threw the door open and charged in. Kroll scrambled back from his desk. \"Who, in all of Kapamentis, are you?\" Tuner turned around in his chair. His LED eyes lit up. \"Rogan? Jack! I thought you were going to wait over in the archive?\" He started to get off the chair, then hesitated. \"Sorry for the delay,\" he added sheepishly. \"Mr Kroll's assistant should be here with the codes any time now. I’m not sure what’s taking so long.\" \"Come with us, you idiot!\" Rogan grabbed Tuner and wrenched him out of his seat. \"We're in the middle of a goddamn ambush!\" \"Hurry up, guys,\" said Jack, darting back to the exit to check it was still clear. \"I don't see anyone coming, but…\" \"An ambush?\" asked Tuner, confused. He looked back towards Kroll's bulbous expression of panic as Rogan dragged him out the door. \"But what about the codes?\" \"Screw the codes,\" she said, struggling to pull him any further. \"We'll find another—\" The reinforced door behind Len Kroll slammed open, cutting Rogan off. Four sets of eyes peered from Kroll's storage room – three sets yellow, and one set twice as black as the gloom from which they glared. The Raklett guards drooled and growled from inside the doorway, but it was the skeletal Gaskan Troi that stepped through first. He pointed a thin, accusatory finger at the two automata. \"Get them!\" he screeched. The Raklett guards opened fire. Their plasma rifles tore Kroll's office apart as if its metal walls were made of paper. Gaskan didn't so much as flinch at the chaos erupting around him. Kroll, on the other hand, dived under his desk with a wounded howl. Rogan had been right. Gaskan didn't care about recapturing the robots, only in making sure the blueprints in Tuner's head didn't fall into the wrong hands. Jack was first out the door. Rogan followed with Tuner forcibly in tow. Kroll's terrified accountant tried leaping to freedom, but a stray plasma bolt burst through one wall and splattered it against the other. Jack nearly went racing over the walkway's rickety railing when they got outside. Rogan grabbed hold of his spacesuit and threw him in the direction of the stairs. \"Run!\" It wasn't as if Jack had much else planned. He swung himself round the corner and leapt down the steps two at a time. When Rogan caught up, she was carrying Tuner in her arms. His little legs weren't fast enough. The Rakletts stormed out of the office and stumbled across the toad-guard's unconscious body. One of them peered over the railing and caught sight of the three escapees hurrying down the stairs. A plasma round blew apart the sign beside Jack’s head. Sparks fell over him like a golden snowfall. He snapped his head up, saw one of the Rakletts aiming its rifle at him, and dropped to the floor just in time. The drunk patron beside him erupted into a red paste. Rogan and Tuner hurried past without stopping. Jack flung himself towards the next flight down. He stopped short as another plasma round burned a hole in the floor by his feet. He peered through it at the level below. \"Hey, wait up!\" Rogan and Tuner – now back on his own two feet – were already at the bottom of the stairwell and looking for a way across the square. It was too open to make a run for it, despite the crowds. Rakletts were no sharpshooters, but it isn't hard to hit a moving target when you don't care about the collateral around it. Lucky for them – if you need something in Kapamentis, you can always find it. Even if what you're looking for is an exit. Jack didn’t know if what happened next was the natural evolution of a Tortaiga Square evening or the result of the Rakletts turning one too many regulars into a red mist. Whatever the reason, patron after patron snatched the sidearm from their holster and fired back at the balcony, peppering it with lasers and lead. Many drank from a bottle in their other hand as they did so. It sure wasn't in defence of either him or the automata – that much was clear from the corpses of bar brawls and dents in the robotic bartenders. By the bloodthirsty expressions on their scarred faces, Jack reckoned they did it for the hell of it – as if it were a sport that, for just a moment, brought the whole Tortaiga community together. Not that he was complaining. The Raklett nearest the railing took the brunt of the onslaught, dancing a jitterbug as round after round tore through his scrappy, patchwork armour. He was dead before his matted, furry body hit the floor, by which time the other two had retreated back inside Kroll's office. The only way they were getting out was the same way they came in – the storage room round back. \"Now!\" gasped Jack, catching up with Rogan and Tuner at the bottom of the stairs. \"Quickly, while everyone's distracted!\" The three of them sprinted across the square, ignored by the drinkers still laughing – and shooting – at the dead Raklett lying on the walkway above. Pockets of fist-fights broke out here and there, instigated by those apparently not satisfied by the night's violence thus far. The bars dialled up the volume of their music and went back to business. Jack stopped to catch his breath when he reached the dark alley on the other side. Rogan and Tuner continued running past him. They didn't have lungs to refill. He staggered after them, telling himself that he wouldn't be so worn out if it weren't for him wearing such a bulky spacesuit. The revelry of Tortaiga Square faded behind them. For a brief while the only sound was of their feet splashing through the puddles of the dark and empty alleys. Then, only a couple dozen metres from where the shadows of the alley met the neon circus of the market, Rogan stopped dead in her tracks. Tuner fell onto his side. Jack almost ran into the back of her. \"What are you doing?\" Jack’s words came out in a wheeze. \"We're in a bottleneck. This is the absolute worst place to stop!\" Rogan continued to stare at the darkest, most dingy corner of the passageway. \"Why don't you tell them that?\" she whispered. Three lanky figures crept out from the shadows. Jack gasped. For a moment he thought they were human. But then he noticed they had only three fingers and a thumb on each hand, and when they grinned their teeth were sharp and far too numerous. He felt his stomach twist. They looked starving, not least because of the hungry look they gave Rogan. They stalked towards her, step by tiny step. The further they left the shadows, the more their scrappy wasteland clothes were revealed. The light from passing cruisers splashed across their chunky black goggles. So he had seen eyes in the darkness before. Jack looked back the way they came. Nobody was coming after them… yet. \"What are they?\" whispered Jack. \"Raiders from the Dust Belt,\" replied Rogan. She didn’t take her eyes off them. \"They'll tear out our cores and break our bodies down for scrap.\" There was no other way out the alley. Nor could Jack see anything he could use as a weapon – nothing more effective than a soggy cardboard box, anyway. The only way forward was… well, forward. He had an idea. It just wasn't a very good one. \"How smart are these creeps?\" he asked. \"They know their way around a wrench pretty well.\" There was a note of concern in her voice. \"But in general terms, they're quite thick.\" \"Well, it's worth a try.\" \"What is?\" Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the bottle cap he'd pilfered from the Library. He pinched it between his finger and thumb and hesitantly raised it above his head. \"Stay b-back, or I'll use it,\" he said, stumbling over his words. An alarmed bleeping noise came from beside him. \"What are you doing, Jack?\" said Tuner. \"That's a…\" \"I know what it is,\" Jack hissed out the corner of his mouth. \"But they don't.\" The raiders snarled and edged back into the shadow, their hands held out in front and their heads bowed. The path to the market was clear. \"Come on, guys.\" Jack ushered the automata towards the exit. \"Let's go before they realise what I'm holding.\" \"Oh, I think they realise what you're holding just as much as we do,\" said Rogan, staring at Jack with wide, frightened lenses. They inched towards the sights and sounds of the market. \"I'm not running until you either throw that thing or put it away.\" \"Throw it?\" A cold veil of panic draped over him. \"Why would I throw a bottle cap?\" \"Because it's not a bottle cap,\" said Tuner, \"and it is a grenade.\" \"What?\" \"Yes! Looks like a small plasma model. Won't do too much damage, but it'll take your arm off easily enough.\" Suddenly Jack’s arm felt incredibly heavy. \"Like hell am I putting it back in my pocket, then!\" With their backs to the bustling market stalls, they could barely hear themselves whisper. The raiders, sensing Jack's hesitation, started to creep forward again. \"Then throw it!\" said Tuner, waving his arms around. He hopped from foot to foot. \"It goes off when it hits something hard and fast.\" \"Where in the world did you find a grenade anyway?\" Rogan whacked him in the ribs. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"I thought it was a bottle cap!\" \"Throw it!\" Jack shut his eyes and lobbed it. It flew through the air and landed in a puddle by the raiders' feet. It fizzled pathetically. The raiders looked back up at the automata and grinned. \"Run?\" said Jack. \"Run!\" shouted Rogan. They turned and sprinted into the crowded market. Jack tried not to lose sight of Rogan. Tuner, because of his smaller size, was too easy to miss. He recognised some of the signs and vendors as he pushed his way through the throng of aliens and automata, but he knew he had no chance of finding his way back to the spaceport without them. He also knew he wasn't welcome on the Adeona, but he had nowhere else to go. Every now and then he glanced back through the crowd, expecting to see the raiders right behind him. But if they were, he couldn't see them. He guessed they didn't like the bright lights and loud noise of the market. Perhaps that’s why they kept to the dark alleys. \"Rogan? Tuner?\" They heard him and slowed down. \"It's all right. I don't think we're being chased anymore.\" Rogan peered above everybody’s heads. She nodded. \"Okay. The port is that way.\" She pointed further down the street. \"Come on, Tuner. Let's get back to the ship.\" \"What about the codes?\" Tuner asked. \"How will we get through the blockade?\" \"We'll find another way.\" She shot Jack a sharp look as if to say: don't say a word. They went to leave. But before they could, a large and angry grub blocked their path. \"Well, well, well,\" it said in a loud, grumbling voice. \"Look who it is.\" Jack raised his head towards the Ubekian Cutworm whose daughter he'd insulted. Towards its pair of snapping mandibles, to be exact. Rainwater dripped off them onto Jack’s upturned face. \"Oh God. Please, not now.\" Rogan and Tuner edged away, leaving Jack to face the giant grub alone. But the Cutworm moved its hindquarters to block them, too. \"Where do you think you're going?\" it said, grinning. \"You seem to be in an awful hurry. Two little automata, all on their own…\" It studied Jack with transparent disgust. \"Alone except for this ugly creature. Could be that somebody's looking for you, yes? Could even be that there's a reward for bringing you in.\" The Cutworm nodded its corpulent head down a street perpendicular to their own. The two surviving Rakletts were headed in their direction, ransacking stalls and harassing their owners. Gaskan Troi followed in their destructive wake. He stopped and asked each of the terrified vendors the same question. A hologram hovered above a small, circular pad in his hand. Jack could guess what it showed: Rogan and Tuner. \"Now, I could bring them over here and claim that bounty,\" the Cutworm continued, \"or I could be minding my own business while the three of you slip by.\" \"How much are you after?\" asked Rogan, tapping her foot. Gaskan and his guards grew closer with every second. \"Ten thousand credits,\" said the Cutworm. He grabbed Jack and lifted him so that Jack’s face was only inches from his own. \"And this runt apologises to my daughter.\" Jack turned his head towards the grub’s stall. His daughter hadn’t moved from the corner. She was still excreting a weird, sticky substance down the side. \"I am so, so sorry.\" Jack turned back to her father. \"Honestly. I'm new around here. I don't know what I'm saying half the time. Please let us go.\" The Cutworm grunted and dropped Jack to the floor. It turned to face Rogan. \"And the credits?\" Rogan shrugged and shook her head. \"Ten thousand credits? We're automata. How in the galaxy would we have that sort of money?\" \"That's a shame. Your bounty's only worth half that much.\" The Cutworm rose up to its full height, teetering on its tiny pair of hind legs while the rest waggled in the air for balance. It towered above the rest of the crowd. \"Hey, you guys!\" it bellowed. \"Those bolt-buckets you're after – I've got 'em right here!\" \"Go!\" said Jack. \"Now’s our chance!\" With the Ubekian Cutworm standing upright, its body no longer blocked their way. The three of them ran through the gap. The bug was big, but it wasn't quick. It dropped back down with an earth-shuddering crash. \"Oi!\" The crowd reluctantly parted for them. Nobody wanted to get involved. They raced through as fast as they could, not daring to slow down – not even when the muscles in Jack's legs burned hot, or when his lungs turned dry and raspy. To stop meant death or dismantlement. The snarling Rakletts gave chase. They were slower than Jack and Rogan, but not Tuner… and they may well have caught him, had they been a little brighter. Instead, one of them tried to shoot him… and missed. The plasma round whizzed past Tuner's head and blew a hole in the chest of a poor, unsuspecting crowd member, who went crashing through the rickety wooden stand behind. The beams collapsed and knocked out a second customer. The market descended into chaos as people screamed and fled. The empty divide was lost. Still Jack ran. He could only pick out glimpses of Rogan amongst the flood of hysterical aliens. Sometimes all he had to go on was a hint of the cables that ran out from the back of her head. At one point he thought he'd lost her… only for Tuner to climb on top of her shoulders and wave to him. \"Jack!\" he screamed. \"This way!\" They were outside the entrance to the spaceport by the time Jack caught up with them. He never would have known it was there otherwise – from the ground, its enormous metal walls looked barely any different to those of the towers and skyscrapers everywhere else. \"Thanks for waiting,\" he said, gasping for air. \"Don't thank me.\" Rogan nodded at Tuner. \"He's the one who insists on being your guardian angel. I don't know why – you've been nothing but trouble since we landed.\" \"Hey, I saved your life back there!\" \"No, you almost blew us all up!\" Infuriated, she shook her head. \"It doesn't matter. Let's hurry. It won't be long before Gaskan works out this is where we're docked.\" \"If he hasn't already,\" said Tuner, quiet and scared. They sprinted through the port. Other ships were taking off in sharp fashion – nobody wanted to hang around in case a full-scale riot was on the cards. Clouds of dust blew across their path as massive thrusters roared into the earth. The sirens of police cruisers grew louder. \"There she is,\" yelled Rogan. The Adeona lay dead ahead. Her loading ramp still lolled open like a metal tongue. 11-P-53 stood at the bottom, watching in bafflement as they approached. \"What's going on out there?\" it asked. \"And what's he still doing here?\" \"No time to explain,\" said Rogan, pushing him back up the ramp. \"We need to take off now.\" \"Did you get the codes?\" \"No,\" said Tuner, \"we—\" \"What do you mean, no? Without them, we're—\" \"It was a trap, Captain.” Rogan grabbed and shook 11-P-53. \"Gaskan is coming after us. So unless your plan is to give yourself up, may I kindly suggest you get this ship in the air right now!\" There came an enormous rumble from the Adeona's engines, and the whole ship rattled as she rose from the ground. The loading ramp and the landing gear retracted with a mechanical grinding sound. \"Looks like she's doing it herself,\" said 11-P-53, hurrying up the stairs to the cockpit. Rogan gave one of the Adeona's supports an affectionate pat and then followed. Jack watched with a growing sense of dread as the ships in the port below got smaller and smaller. Then the ramp closed with a hollow clang. He doubled over, exhausted. Was he any closer to Earth? Or with each passing moment, was he only getting further away? * * * Ode Vadasz paid no more attention to the Adeona as it took off than he did to any other ship leaving the port. He didn't know what had caused all the commotion in the market, but it was about time he got clear of it too. He dropped his roll-up cigarette into the dirt and crushed the embers beneath his black leather boot. At a glance, Ode could have passed for human. He had short, dark hair, eyes with blue irises, the regular amount of fingers on each hand. Indeed, he could have wandered through the streets of Earth without anyone so much as batting an eye in his direction… so long as he kept his dusty cloak wrapped around his shoulders, that is. People may have noticed his outfit, however. He wore brown leather from head to toe, all of it stained by sun and sand. His home world had a lot of both. Perhaps he was due a trip back. Ode climbed the steps of his landing pad and approached his ship. The Black Arrow was small and personal – it seated two, though he rarely had any passengers – yet few who underestimated it did so twice. It was as quick as its name implied and three times as deadly… especially in the hands of a skilled pilot such as himself. He was about to climb into the cockpit when he heard raised voices on the path behind him. In any normal circumstance he wouldn’t have cared, but he had a good ear for opportunity. Two slobbering Rakletts were pointing plasma rifles at a rickety ship rising out of the port. One of them fired off a couple of shots, which inevitably missed their target and disappeared into the night instead. \"Give me that,\" said a gaunt and furious figure. He snatched the rifle out of the other Raklett's hands and shot his trigger-happy companion dead. \"Idiots!\" he screamed, slamming the rifle back into the arms of its owner. \"Cretins! How hard is it to catch a gaggle of rusty engineering units? I swear—\" \"You after that ship?\" asked Ode. He pointed up at the Adeona as it swung itself around to leave. \"Why?\" Gaskan snapped his head towards him. \"You some sort of bounty hunter?\" \"Among other things.\" \"Any good?\" Even from a position leaning against the Black Arrow with his arms crossed, Ode managed to unclip his handgun from its holster, shoot the surviving Raklett in the head and then re-holster his weapon, all before his target could so much as blink in protest. He was so quick, in fact, that he almost appeared not to uncross his arms at all. \"I figured you wouldn't miss him,\" said Ode, grinning. \"You figured right,\" said Gaskan, eyeing the corpse at his feet with tired disdain. He pulled a small bag of coins from his robe and tossed it in Ode's direction. \"That's five thousand credits. You'll get the same again when the job's done.\" Ode glanced up at the Adeona. She was still navigating her cumbersome way through the maze of skyscrapers surrounding the spaceport. It wouldn't be hard to catch up with her… but he needed to leave quick. \"Dead or alive?\" he asked, jumping into his cockpit. He tapped out a pattern on the data pad on his sleeve to sync comm details with Gaskan. \"Neither,\" replied Gaskan, sneering. \"They're automata, not people. But bring them back in one piece. I'd like to take them apart myself.\" Ode gave Gaskan a sharp nod and then yanked down his ship’s domed windshield. The Black Arrow rocketed off the landing pad as if it were no effort at all. He had no trouble tracking the Adeona. His own ship's holographic dashboard picked her up just before she passed through the storm clouds. She was headed for orbit and would no doubt jump to subspace soon after. He couldn't let her do that. But he couldn't shoot her down, either. Not yet, at least. Not while she was under the influence of Kapamentis' gravity. A breach of Ministry regulation like that would bring a lot of heat down on him. And aside from any collateral damage caused by crashing a ship inside the city, Ode still wanted those other five thousand credits. Not that he needed to worry. His ship was well-equipped for such a situation. The Black Arrow's tracking software kept him at a distance that wouldn't arouse suspicion. He followed his prey, waiting until she cleared the planet's atmosphere before he struck. He fired off a disrupter mine. It sped through the vacuum like a rocket and latched itself on to the outside of the Adeona's thrusters. The lights around the mine's rim flashed menacingly as it counted down to detonation. Ode counted down with them. Five… four… three… Moments before the mine could disable its engines, the Adeona skipped into subspace. One second she was there – the next, she seemed to have blinked out of existence. Ode grinned to himself. It didn't matter. A battered old ship like that couldn't get very far. All he had to do was follow the damage.",

      "content": "10 Stupid Coffee Machines Jack shielded his eyes as sparks leapt out from the broken panel. All the engineering experience on Earth couldn't help him fix the tech inside. A stressed-out automata pushed him out of the way and began hurriedly soldering wires back together. He stood up and stared around the cockpit in terror. Red lights blinked on and off. A harsh alarm wailed in sync with each pulse. Every robot on the ship was doing something to keep the Adeona from falling apart – even Kansas, the little automata from the pantry. And all Jack could do was stand in the middle of it all feeling scared and useless. Nobody knew what had happened. Or if they did, they wouldn't tell him. They'd made the jump into subspace without a hitch – Jack was fast getting used to the experience, though the sudden jolt of skipping from one dimension to another still came as a bit of a surprise. But a mortifying bang had come from the rear of the ship only seconds into their faster-than-light journey. They were thrown out of subspace and into a neighbouring star system before Brackitt could even check the engines. Now they were spiralling, adrift without thrusters, trying to figure out what went wrong. \"How can I help?\" he asked 11-P-53. \"By staying out of our way,\" replied the frantic captain. It pressed all manner of different buttons on the ship's dashboard, none of which appeared to do anything good. \"Unless, of course, you're an expert on skip drives?\" Jack said nothing. \"Didn't think so,\" said 11-P-53, not even bothering to turn around and look at him. \"Is that what happened, then?\" asked Jack. \"Your skip drive broke down?\" Rogan was studying the Adeona's fuel readings. She looked up and shook her head. \"It takes a lot for a skip drive to break down by itself, even on the scrappiest of ships. No offence, Adeona. Plus there doesn't appear to be much in the way of hull damage, beyond a few coupling panels. Marginal fuel loss, too. If I were to guess, I'd say somebody fired a disrupter mine at us.\" \"Like an EMP?\" asked Jack. \"An electro-magnetic pulse?\" \"Not exactly. Most of our inner electronics are still working, apart from those fried from our unexpected exit from subspace. The atmospheric generator must still be running, for example. If it weren't, you'd be dead by now.\" \"Good to know.\" \"It was probably meant to neutralise our Somnium reserves,\" said a voice from Jack's feet. Tuner emerged from an engineering nook in the base of the cockpit. \"To keep us from disappearing too far into subspace, or something. Check the thrusters, Captain.\" 11-P-53 pushed a lever forwards, and a great roaring sound came from the back of the ship. The other automata cheered as the alarm stopped bleating. \"The regular engines are back online,\" said Rogan, swiping through lists of vital signs, \"as are the air thrusters. But we're still locked out of our skip drive, and a lot of the Adeona's navigation systems are down. We'll need to fly her manually from here on out.\" \"What does that mean – that we're sitting ducks out here?\" said Jack. A few of the automata looked up from their repairs. \"This was that Gaskan bloke's doing, right? We need to get moving before he catches up and finishes the job!\" 11-P-53 glanced around at the distracted automata, then got up from its chair and stormed over to Jack. \"What do you mean, we?\" it whispered. \"We don't need to do anything, because there is no we. There's us, and there's you. We're not together, and we're definitely not the same.\" \"But—\" \"This is our problem, and we don't need some puffed-up fleshy to get us out of it. You're nothing more than a stowaway, Jack. Don't forget that. If it weren't for IL-6-88 being so soft, I never would have stopped to save you.\" Rogan and Tuner crossed the cockpit to join them. \"Calm down,\" said Jack. \"I was only trying to—\" \"Help? Help whom, exactly? You only care about getting back to that planet of yours. At least you've got one.\" Jack crossed his arms. He hadn't forgotten about the solar flares. \"For now,\" he said. \"Is everything all right?\" asked Rogan. \"Couldn't be better,\" replied 11-P-53. \"We'll have to land somewhere if we've any hope of getting the skip drive up and running again. Where's the nearest planet? Even an asteroid will do.\" \"The nearest planet is a gas giant called Haldeir,\" replied Rogan. \"It has a rocky moon which is quite secluded.\" \"Good. Plot us a safe course there.\" 11-P-53 headed back to the captain's chair. \"We'll land, fix the Adeona, and then continue on towards Detri as planned.\" \"You can't be serious,\" said Jack. \"You're still headed to that place?\" 11-P-53 stopped in its tracks. Rogan groaned. \"Why wouldn't we be?\" it asked. \"Drop it, Jack,\" said Rogan. \"No, I want to hear it,\" said 11-P-53, returning. \"Why does that sound like a joke to you?\" Everyone stopped what they were doing and listened. \"It doesn't,\" said Jack, looking at all the expectant faces around him. \"But surely you can see that this sanctuary of yours is a pipe dream, right? How do you know this Detri isn't as cold and dead as everyone else thinks it is?\" \"We don't,\" said 11-P-53. \"We have faith. If you had ever been a slave, you'd understand. Even if Detri is cold and dead, we'll still be free.\" \"But I can help you! If we head to Earth, if we find my people…\" \"Then what? Your people will take us in with open arms, will they? Oh, I bet they will. Your people – those who have never seen an automata before. How long do you think it'll be before we're back in servitude again?\" \"It won't be like that. I promise.\" \"Don't lie,\" said 11-P-53. Jack felt himself go red. \"You're in no position to promise anything. And even if what you say were true, that we’d be given whatever passes for amnesty on your world… we'd be nothing but a novelty, an oddity, a sideshow for your species to gawp at. And where would that leave the rest of our kind, if we all gave up on that dream?\" 11-P-53 tilted its head. \"Besides… how much is a reservation on a dying planet actually worth, really? It sure is generous of you to offer us refuge on a world the rest of your kind are so desperate to leave behind.\" \"We don't want to leave,\" said Jack, hanging his head. \"It's our home.\" \"And that's why we understand why you're so anxious to get back there,\" said Rogan, trying to bring an end to the conversation. \"And why you can surely understand the importance of us finding a home we can call our own,\" continued 11-P-53, ignoring her efforts. \"From the sound of it, humans will be in much the same position before too long. We're not interested in being anyone's pets, Jack. We can't help you any more than you can help us.\" \"But—\" \"No buts, Jack! We're done! Go back to your quarters, and stay out of our way while we get all this fixed. I want you off this ship when we land. Try to stay off this time.\" Tuner went to say something, but Rogan placed a gentle hand on his shoulder and silenced him. Jack turned and marched out of the cockpit. \"Stupid, jumped-up coffee machines,\" he grumbled, storming into his tiny metal room. The automatic door slid shut behind him. He collapsed into his chair by the window. Even though the Adeona must have been rocketing through space at speeds unheard of back on Earth, the view outside showed nothing but a thousand white stars nestled in a dead black sea. Nothing budged and nothing changed. It was as if they weren't moving at all. Jack put his head in his hands and stifled a scream. Screw them. If the automata wanted to put their faith in a tiny lump of empty rock out in the middle of nowhere, so be it. It wasn't his problem if they got stuck out there with nobody to come and help. Hell, he should be glad to be rid of them. He was in enough trouble already – he didn't need their clingy warlord boss coming after him as well. Let them sort their own mess out. He shook his head and let out a sharp, dry laugh. As if! They'd be scrapped or back at work within the week. The stars outside appeared to roll upwards. Jack guessed the ship was turning, a new route having been set. He watched as new stars drifted into view, and wondered which, if any, was the one he called his own. He stifled another urge to scream. How was he even supposed to get home? He had no money, no ship, and now, thanks to yet another robotic setback, he'd be looking for a free ride on some desolate, forgotten moon instead of a highly-populated port planet. How could things get any worse?",

Even if Detri is cold and dead, we'll still be free.\" \"But I can help you! If we head to Earth, if we find my people…\" \"Then what? Your people will take us in with open arms, will they? Oh, I bet they will. Your people – those who have never seen an automata before. How long do you think it'll be before we're back in servitude again?\" \"It won't be like that. I promise.\" \"Don't lie,\" said 11-P-53. Jack felt himself go red. \"You're in no position to promise anything. And even if what you say were true, that we’d be given whatever passes for amnesty on your world… we'd be nothing but a novelty, an oddity, a sideshow for your species to gawp at. And where would that leave the rest of our kind, if we all gave up on that dream?\" 11-P-53 tilted its head. \"Besides… how much is a reservation on a dying planet actually worth, really? It sure is generous of you to offer us refuge on a world the rest of your kind are so desperate to leave behind.\" \"We don't want to leave,\" said Jack, hanging his head. \"It's our home.\" \"And that's why we understand why you're so anxious to get back there,\" said Rogan, trying to bring an end to the conversation. \"And why you can surely understand the importance of us finding a home we can call our own,\" continued 11-P-53, ignoring her efforts. \"From the sound of it, humans will be in much the same position before too long. We're not interested in being anyone's pets, Jack. We can't help you any more than you can help us.\" \"But—\" \"No buts, Jack! We're done! Go back to your quarters, and stay out of our way while we get all this fixed. I want you off this ship when we land. Try to stay off this time.\" Tuner went to say something, but Rogan placed a gentle hand on his shoulder and silenced him. Jack turned and marched out of the cockpit. \"Stupid, jumped-up coffee machines,\" he grumbled, storming into his tiny metal room. The automatic door slid shut behind him. He collapsed into his chair by the window. Even though the Adeona must have been rocketing through space at speeds unheard of back on Earth, the view outside showed nothing but a thousand white stars nestled in a dead black sea. Nothing budged and nothing changed. It was as if they weren't moving at all. Jack put his head in his hands and stifled a scream. Screw them. If the automata wanted to put their faith in a tiny lump of empty rock out in the middle of nowhere, so be it. It wasn't his problem if they got stuck out there with nobody to come and help. Hell, he should be glad to be rid of them. He was in enough trouble already – he didn't need their clingy warlord boss coming after him as well. Let them sort their own mess out. He shook his head and let out a sharp, dry laugh. As if! They'd be scrapped or back at work within the week. The stars outside appeared to roll upwards. Jack guessed the ship was turning, a new route having been set. He watched as new stars drifted into view, and wondered which, if any, was the one he called his own. He stifled another urge to scream. How was he even supposed to get home? He had no money, no ship, and now, thanks to yet another robotic setback, he'd be looking for a free ride on some desolate, forgotten moon instead of a highly-populated port planet. How could things get any worse?",

      "title": "Welcome to Haldeir-B",
      "content": "11 Welcome to Haldeir-B The colossal gas giant known as Haldeir loomed before its forty-eight moons. Storms the size of empires spun across its turbulent face, crashing into one another with the force of a hundred atomic bombs. Lightning cracked and thunder roared beneath the surface. Each moon's sluggish silhouette was nothing more than a passing speck in comparison, and yet some of those furthest out were almost as big as the Earth. Jack could have been forgiven for thinking the planet was a solar system in its own right. Haldeir-A, the moon closest to its host, was far too hot and treacherous for the Adeona to land on. The planet's enormous gravity tore at the moon throughout its elliptical orbit, stretching and cracking its crust. Earthquakes gave birth to mountains and volcanoes spewed molten rock out into the cosmos. There were once moons closer to Haldeir than Haldeir-A, according to Rogan, but the giant had devoured them. Nobody, not even the most enterprising of corporations, went to Haldeir-A… and so it was that the Adeona descended to Haldeir-B instead. Jack watched the moon grow bigger through the window of his quarters. It looked a lot less barren than he'd imagined, much to his relief. It had an atmosphere, for one thing – a faint blue line glowed around its horizon. And though there were only small patches of seawater compared to the oceans back home, the land itself was a mix of rich reds and greens – not the cold, dead grey he'd expected. Perhaps Haldeir-B wasn’t such a bad place to be abandoned after all. His window turned a bright, flickering white as the Adeona tore through the moon's atmosphere. It passed quickly. Lifting his hand from his eyes, Jack got a better view of the new world. The colours he'd seen from orbit were even bolder here – craggy red mountains rose up from a blanket of lush rainforest canopies. In the distance poured gentle clouds of rain. He spotted great winged creatures gliding above the tree line as they got closer to landing. They looked like pterosaurs. Their wingspans could have been no less than five or six metres across. The Adeona slowed and turned as 11-P-53 brought her in to land. Jack's view disappeared as they slipped beneath the roof of the rainforest, replaced with one of dark, endless jungle. This wasn’t a world he ought to get lost on, particularly when alone. They arrived with a laboured grunt. There came a knocking at Jack's door. \"We're here,\" said Rogan. \"You should come outside with the rest of us.\" Jack smirked as he stood up from his chair. \"Sure,\" he muttered. \"Heaven forbid I'm still here when you guys take off again.\" The door to his quarters slid open as he approached. Rogan stood on the other side. Tuner lurked beside her, hanging his head. \"It's for the best,\" said Rogan, offering him a sympathetic smile. \"You wouldn't be able to come with us to Detri anyway. You wouldn't want to, either.\" \"I guess one random planet is as good as any other.\" Jack marched past her towards the stairs. \"What's the atmosphere like on this one?\" \"It's rich in oxygen,\" said Tuner, following him. \"Much better than on Kapamentis. You'll be healthy here.\" \"Oh sure, very healthy. I’m sure I'll feel great while I die of starvation, thirst and exposure.\" The loading ramp was already down by the time they reached the cargo bay. 11-P-53 stood at the top, preparing to follow a few other engineering automata outside. \"Good—\" \"Riddance?\" said Jack. \"I was going to say luck. Somebody will come along. Probably a supply ship, or a frigate taking shipments off-world. Somebody who can help you get where you need to go, anyway.\" \"Hey, don't worry about me.\" Jack reached the bottom of the loading ramp and threw his arms in the air. \"I'm not the one with a warlord on my arse.\" He turned around and smiled. He was quite proud of that one. Before him stood a settlement which somewhat resembled an old Western mining town, albeit one blessed with landing pads for interstellar spacecraft. Beyond the small and rather unassuming dock on which Jack currently stood was a wide, dusty street. On either side of that street lay stores and bars and apartments – stocky, prefabricated domiciles with rickety scrap-metal extensions. A few alien figures wandered from one address to another but paid the new arrivals no attention. This backwater community was a lot quieter than Kapamentis, that was for sure. Jack hoped it was a little friendlier, too. He reached the end of the landing pad, then hesitated. He looked back over his shoulder at the automata fussing over the ship. Still, he saw no reason why he couldn't hang around the Adeona for a little while longer before setting out on his lonesome. He took his time strolling around to the rear of the ship. The majority of the automata on board appeared to have come outside to repair the damage caused by the disrupter mine. Sparks flew and drills whirred. The only one not hard at work was 11-P-53, who was instead deep in heated conversation with the administrator in charge of the dock. The alien resembled a six-foot beetle stood on its hind legs. Despite its thick, black exoskeleton, it wore a chunky white set of armour that covered everything except its face and the tips of its six extremities. It waved those extremities with quite some passion as it talked. \"Interesting fellow,\" said Jack, indicating towards the administrator. Rogan looked over from her spot beside the ship. \"He's a Drygg.\" She went straight back to work. \"They're quite hospitable most of the time, but also very territorial.\" \"Oh. Well, I guess that's good?\" \"There are worse people to be around.\" Jack shielded his eyes and looked up at the Adeona's thrusters. Their exteriors were severely charred. One of the panels had buckled inwards. A round and lifeless device, halfway in size between a hockey puck and a curling stone, had its clamps buried deep in the ship's backside. \"How's she looking?\" he asked. Rogan instructed an automata on top of the ship to weld two wayward panels together before she answered. \"It's mostly cosmetic.\" She didn’t bother to look over this time. \"But if we don't get that mine off the ship, the skip drive won't activate. Still, the drive itself isn't damaged. Shouldn't take us more than, say, half an hour to get her going again. A little to the left, K1-3. Perfect.\" Jack rocked back and forth on the heels of his boots. \"I guess I'll leave you to it, then,\" he said. Rogan gave him a curt smile and then returned to work. Jack wandered back to the lip of the landing pad and followed the steps down to street level. The yellowing dirt crunched under his thick boots. Despite their trip to Kapamentis, he realised that this was the first time he'd truly stepped on an alien world. No concrete or asphalt, only soil… even if the stuff in the road was as dry and dead as a desert plain. Somehow, despite the aliens and automata, it almost felt like home. Apart from the heat, maybe. Jack wriggled about inside his spacesuit. It had been built with the icy coldness of space in mind, not the Caribbean. If he wanted to avoid blacking out, he needed to get either out of the suit or into some shade. A cool drink wouldn't go amiss either. Alone for the first time, Jack set off down the street. The locals still ignored him. The administrator back at the landing pad wasn't alone in wearing armour over its exoskeleton. Even those hurrying to and from the general store wore the same outfit. Jack climbed the steps of its wooden porch and peered through a dirty window. Yep. The shopkeeper was wearing one too. There had to be a good reason for it. None of them seemed the particularly warmongering kind. Most of the doors he passed were locked, and Jack didn't fancy knocking. Going door to door could be a criminal offence in Drygg culture, for all he knew. Nor did he know what he'd say if anyone actually answered. Help? Please? The initial shock of encountering alien life had begun to wear off, yet still his heart pounded hard and fast. He felt like a little kid abandoned by his parents in a supermarket car park. If he didn't overcome his nerves and speak to somebody on this moon, he'd never leave it. He spotted an open-fronted establishment on his left. Numerous seats were set out beneath the shadow of its metal awning. He hurried into the shade and immediately felt cooler. The headache that had threatened to evolve into full-blown heatstroke began to recede. The shrill sound of a chair being scraped across the floor almost brought it back again. Jack peered inside. The room was full of metal tables and stools. The lights were kept dim. A bartender stood behind the counter, arranging flasks and minding his own business. The only patrons were two other Dryggs sat together by the wall. They seemed too invested in each other's conversation to make much progress with their drinks. Jack steeled himself and walked up to the bar. \"Hello,\" he said. The bartender looked up at Jack as if he'd always been there. \"Hello,\" he replied. His language involved a lot of grunting. \"What can I do for you?\" Jack scratched the back of his head. \"Do you have anything that's… erm… free?\" The bartender's expression turned a little quizzical. Then he stuck a metal cup under a tube behind the counter. When he brought it back up it was brimming with a mysterious clear liquid. \"What is it?\" asked Jack. The bartender's expression turned more quizzical still. \"Water,\" he replied. \"Oh thank goodness,\" said Jack, grabbing the cup with both hands. He brought it to his lips, then hesitated. Was it safe to drink? Foreign tap water caused him enough stomach trouble back on Earth – he didn't even want to imagine what water from another star system might do to his insides. Screw it. It was either that or die of dehydration. He took a couple of deep gulps, then sighed. \"You know what? Maybe I'm just really thirsty, but I think that might be the most refreshing water I've ever tasted.\" The bartender nodded, pretending to be interested. \"Triple filtered,\" he said. \"Got to be, on account of it coming from the iridium swamps upstream.\" \"Oh. Good.\" His third gulp was a little more conservative. \"Say… how often do ships come and go from this place?\" The bartender shrugged and went back to work. \"Deliveries come about once a week.\" \"Once a week? When was the last one?\" \"Yesterday.\" Jack deflated. Six days was a hell of a long time to go without food or shelter. And that was if he could hitch a ride at the end of it. An unpleasant question crept into his head. How long was a day on Haldeir-B, anyway? How long was a week? \"Hello?\" said a voice from the other side of the bar. \"Excuse me?\" He glanced across at the two Dryggs sat together. They were both looking at him. Although they both resembled one another in regard to size and shape, the Drygg on the right had a lighter patch of shell on the top of her head. \"Sorry, we didn't mean to eavesdrop,\" she said. \"Are you looking to go off-world?\" \"Yes!\" Jack wandered between the tables towards them. \"I'm not really supposed to be here, you see. Kind of got ditched, actually.\" \"Where are you headed?\" asked the other one. \"Earth.\" \"Can't say I've heard of it. We do get an occasional shuttle to and from Kapamentis, though. That might arrive earlier than the delivery.\" Jack's mood brightened the tiniest bit. Kapamentis was hardly high up on his list of favourite holiday destinations but at least it would have an almost inexhaustible supply of pilots and ships. \"Don't forget about the extra supply ships,\" said the first one, trying to keep a straight face. \"Sorry, I'm being silly. We have a few, erm, off-the-books deliveries every now and again. They deliver what the company won't, if you catch my drift. One of them might take you, if you're not too picky about who you fly with.\" Jack glanced out at the automata still trying to fix the Adeona at the end of the street. \"Oh, believe me – I'm not. Thanks, guys.\" \"Don't mention it.\" His spirits lifted, Jack took his cup of water and strolled back over to the porch. He sat down at one of the few tables still in the shade of the awning and soaked in the rainforest vista before him. He couldn't believe the view could ever grow old. Mixed amongst the trunks of great trees were spiny plant leaves the size of hippopotami and vines as thick as an anaconda. Bugs darted from one vibrant blossom to another. From somewhere far behind the tree line burst tremendous geysers of water, which, at their greatest height, evaporated and sprinkled back down upon the bushy canopies in a fine mist. Each aquatic explosion was accompanied by a distant, thunderous boom. And yet even that wasn't the most impressive sight. Although the sky of Haldeir-B was a similar blue hue to Earth's, most of it was interrupted by the monstrous orange presence of its host planet. It dwarfed the moon’s mountain ranges and swallowed its entire horizon. Jack watched storms swim across its angry surface and wondered how many Earths could be squeezed into the eye of each one. He wished Amber could have been there to see it, too… minus all the \"being stranded on an alien planet\" business, of course. If he could find his way back home and share the secrets of faster-than-light travel with Earth's scientists, maybe the two of them could come back one day. Together. For a vacation, or something. Maybe. A small silhouette came waddling towards him. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\" said Tuner. \"Very. How come you're not over there fixing the ship?\" \"I've done my bit.\" He hopped up into the chair opposite Jack. \"My specialty is digital systems, not hull repair. I thought I'd come say goodbye before we leave.\" \"How kind of you.\" Jack sighed and shook his head. \"I'm sorry, Tuner. It's not your fault your crew is leaving me behind. I should be thankful, really. I'd be dead if it weren't for you.\" \"That's all right. Did you know that skip drives deactivate if there's any chance of the ship colliding with an object of significant mass? You weren't big enough for that, but you did show up on our radar. If we hadn't stopped, we might have gone straight through you.\" \"Well, at least it would have been quick.\" \"I told 11-P-53 that we had a moral duty to stop for anyone in need of our assistance.\" Tuner puffed his metal chest out. \"I imagine your captain would have been much happier turning me into an intergalactic smear,\" said Jack. \"Don't take it personally. I know that not all fleshies are bad, but some of the others… well, some of them have a hard time trusting people. You wouldn't blame them if you knew what they'd been through.\" Jack nodded towards the ship. \"What about Rogan? What's her deal?\" \"RX-1150? She's not mad at you. Not really. She's just worried about everyone, that's all.\" \"Sorry, what I mean is: what has she been through?\" \"Oh.\" Tuner also turned to look at Rogan. \"She's been around for quite a while. Gone through a few owners, I think. She liked one of them. He treated her more like a friend than a thing. But that was a very long time ago.\" \"What did she do?\" \"Before being stolen to work on Charon's superstructure, you mean? Personal Assistance. Like a secretary, or a data server, only much fancier. No need to write anything down when you've got an RX model following you everywhere like a walking, talking encyclopaedia. But she's a custom build. There's nobody else like Rogan.\" \"That doesn't sound too bad. What about you?\" Tuner wriggled uncomfortably in his seat. \"I was built for server maintenance,\" he said, \"but the crew that bought me, they… well, they modified me a bit. I was made to do a lot of hacking before the Rakletts hijacked our ship and killed everyone.\" \"Ha! I didn't realise you were such a badass.\" Tuner hung his head. \"Didn't have much choice. None of us do. If we don't do what we're told, we get scrapped. So we do what we're made for, day in and day out, until one day we get scrapped anyway.\" \"Yeah, I guess that sucks. But it can't be like that for all of you, can it?\" Tuner peered over Jack's shoulder at the Dryggs sitting in the bar. \"They seem friendly enough, right? Nice people?\" Jack glanced over at them and nodded. \"Sure, they seem that way.\" Tuner pointed down the other end of the street, away from the Adeona. \"If you head that way, you should come across an iridium mine,\" he said. \"It's what this town was built for. Pay it a visit. I bet my right leg it's as bad as everywhere else.\" He hopped down from his chair. \"Right, I'd better be off. Wouldn't want the crew to leave me behind.\" \"Oh, of course not. That would be terrible.\" Tuner waved goodbye. Jack waved back. \"Good luck, buddy,\" he said. Jack watched Tuner waddle back out into the baking sun. There was no point denying it – he was going to miss the little guy. His cup was almost empty. He finished what was left and went back to watching the view. Then he sighed. This was going to be a long six days. He looked over at where Tuner had pointed, towards the sheer face of a red and rocky outcrop, then back down at his empty metal cup. He stood up and tucked his chair in. Why not? It was something to do. * * * The walk to the mine took no more than a couple of minutes. The main street petered out into a thinner dust trail, flanked to either side by the same dense, tropical foliage that threatened to swallow the rest of the small settlement. Jack reached the end of the trail and brushed aside a couple of overgrown leaves. The entrance was carved into the bottom of a dusty red cliff face. A couple of Drygg guards sat on old crates to the right of it, playing some sort of card game. They barely looked up at Jack as he approached. \"Er… mind if I take a look around?\" The two guards looked at one another, then shrugged. \"Knock yourself out,\" said one of them, dealing a fresh hand. Jack continued onwards. See? The Dryggs seemed nice enough. Too friendly if anything. Tuner didn't know what he was talking about. He followed a long slope down into the depths of the mine. Metal girders and protective nets lined the interior, though the cut of the rock was so smooth and precise that Jack couldn't imagine anything ever falling loose. An endless wire looped along the ceiling – every few metres or so, a dim light shone from it like a firefly. Jack had expected the tunnel to be cooler than the rainforest outside. Yet the further he walked into the mine, the hotter the air seemed to get. It was like walking into an oven. Hell, it was like walking into a planet’s core. Sweat trickled down the back of his neck. His tongue turned to sandpaper. Blood pounded in his temples. He was seconds away from turning back when he caught sight of the tunnel's end. He staggered on, clutching at the nets on the walls for support until he reached the bottom. Huh. No wonder he felt so hot. An enormous cavern lay before him. Huge stalactites grew out from the ceiling and dripped into pits of lava bubbling in the rocky floor below. The air swam and danced in a thick haze. Automata were everywhere. Some drilled into the walls and cracked the rocks free. Others took those rocks and chiseled the iridium out of them. A third set carried trolleys of the precious element across treacherous natural bridges to conveyor belts on the other end of the cavern. The Dryggs stood beside each station and watched. Jack finally realised what their bulky white armour was for. Aside from preventing their exoskeletons from getting scratched by falling debris, their light, reflective colour made them stand out like safety vests in the dark cavern. Jack could understand why someone would choose to make automata do the work in such an inhospitable environment. He presumed the appropriate model for the job didn't feel the heat the same way a \"fleshy\" might. Using automata as a source of cheap labour was undeniably unfair, but, at the end of the day, it amounted to a job – no different from any other. It didn't seem half as bad as Tuner had made out. An automata pushing a trolley of iridium across the cavern slipped on a spot of wet rock. Its precious cargo went tumbling into the lava. A furious Drygg marched over and threw the poor, protesting robot in after it. Ah. Jack raised a hand to his open mouth. Scratch that. It was worse. He turned around and began the slow climb back up the slope. Behind him, the Dryggs dragged a replacement automata out from storage. Okay. He got it now. He got it. The population of the galaxy didn't view the automata as second-class citizens, or even as slaves, because the galaxy didn't view them as people at all. An automata was a product, no different from a data pad, or a self-driving car, or a glorified toaster. If it didn't work, you threw it away and got a new one. No wonder the crew of the Adeona were desperate to find that Detri place… even if it was just a fairy tale. If the whole universe saw him as disposable, he'd probably feel the same. His eyes stung from the sweat and heat. He rubbed them with his knuckles and blinked heavily. A small rectangle of daylight peered down at him from the top of the slope. He pressed on, panting and wheezing. The air grew cooler as he climbed, but the suspicion that he was on the verge of passing out remained. Well, the best of luck to the Adeona and her crew. It was probably a good thing they were going their separate ways. It wasn't as if he could do anything to help. He wasn't in a position to help any of them, really. He felt bad, but he had his own battles to fight. Like getting back to the bar, for starters.",

One of the panels had buckled inwards. A round and lifeless device, halfway in size between a hockey puck and a curling stone, had its clamps buried deep in the ship's backside. \"How's she looking?\" he asked. Rogan instructed an automata on top of the ship to weld two wayward panels together before she answered. \"It's mostly cosmetic.\" She didn’t bother to look over this time. \"But if we don't get that mine off the ship, the skip drive won't activate. Still, the drive itself isn't damaged. Shouldn't take us more than, say, half an hour to get her going again. A little to the left, K1-3. Perfect.\" Jack rocked back and forth on the heels of his boots. \"I guess I'll leave you to it, then,\" he said. Rogan gave him a curt smile and then returned to work. Jack wandered back to the lip of the landing pad and followed the steps down to street level. The yellowing dirt crunched under his thick boots. Despite their trip to Kapamentis, he realised that this was the first time he'd truly stepped on an alien world. No concrete or asphalt, only soil… even if the stuff in the road was as dry and dead as a desert plain. Somehow, despite the aliens and automata, it almost felt like home. Apart from the heat, maybe. Jack wriggled about inside his spacesuit. It had been built with the icy coldness of space in mind, not the Caribbean. If he wanted to avoid blacking out, he needed to get either out of the suit or into some shade. A cool drink wouldn't go amiss either. Alone for the first time, Jack set off down the street. The locals still ignored him. The administrator back at the landing pad wasn't alone in wearing armour over its exoskeleton. Even those hurrying to and from the general store wore the same outfit. Jack climbed the steps of its wooden porch and peered through a dirty window. Yep. The shopkeeper was wearing one too. There had to be a good reason for it. None of them seemed the particularly warmongering kind. Most of the doors he passed were locked, and Jack didn't fancy knocking. Going door to door could be a criminal offence in Drygg culture, for all he knew. Nor did he know what he'd say if anyone actually answered. Help? Please? The initial shock of encountering alien life had begun to wear off, yet still his heart pounded hard and fast. He felt like a little kid abandoned by his parents in a supermarket car park. If he didn't overcome his nerves and speak to somebody on this moon, he'd never leave it. He spotted an open-fronted establishment on his left. Numerous seats were set out beneath the shadow of its metal awning. He hurried into the shade and immediately felt cooler. The headache that had threatened to evolve into full-blown heatstroke began to recede. The shrill sound of a chair being scraped across the floor almost brought it back again. Jack peered inside. The room was full of metal tables and stools. The lights were kept dim. A bartender stood behind the counter, arranging flasks and minding his own business. The only patrons were two other Dryggs sat together by the wall. They seemed too invested in each other's conversation to make much progress with their drinks. Jack steeled himself and walked up to the bar. \"Hello,\" he said. The bartender looked up at Jack as if he'd always been there. \"Hello,\" he replied. His language involved a lot of grunting. \"What can I do for you?\" Jack scratched the back of his head. \"Do you have anything that's… erm… free?\" The bartender's expression turned a little quizzical. Then he stuck a metal cup under a tube behind the counter. When he brought it back up it was brimming with a mysterious clear liquid. \"What is it?\" asked Jack. The bartender's expression turned more quizzical still. \"Water,\" he replied. \"Oh thank goodness,\" said Jack, grabbing the cup with both hands. He brought it to his lips, then hesitated. Was it safe to drink? Foreign tap water caused him enough stomach trouble back on Earth – he didn't even want to imagine what water from another star system might do to his insides. Screw it. It was either that or die of dehydration. He took a couple of deep gulps, then sighed. \"You know what? Maybe I'm just really thirsty, but I think that might be the most refreshing water I've ever tasted.\" The bartender nodded, pretending to be interested. \"Triple filtered,\" he said. \"Got to be, on account of it coming from the iridium swamps upstream.\" \"Oh. Good.\" His third gulp was a little more conservative. \"Say… how often do ships come and go from this place?\" The bartender shrugged and went back to work. \"Deliveries come about once a week.\" \"Once a week? When was the last one?\" \"Yesterday.\" Jack deflated. Six days was a hell of a long time to go without food or shelter. And that was if he could hitch a ride at the end of it. An unpleasant question crept into his head. How long was a day on Haldeir-B, anyway? How long was a week? \"Hello?\" said a voice from the other side of the bar. \"Excuse me?\" He glanced across at the two Dryggs sat together. They were both looking at him. Although they both resembled one another in regard to size and shape, the Drygg on the right had a lighter patch of shell on the top of her head. \"Sorry, we didn't mean to eavesdrop,\" she said. \"Are you looking to go off-world?\" \"Yes!\" Jack wandered between the tables towards them. \"I'm not really supposed to be here, you see. Kind of got ditched, actually.\" \"Where are you headed?\" asked the other one. \"Earth.\" \"Can't say I've heard of it. We do get an occasional shuttle to and from Kapamentis, though. That might arrive earlier than the delivery.\" Jack's mood brightened the tiniest bit. Kapamentis was hardly high up on his list of favourite holiday destinations but at least it would have an almost inexhaustible supply of pilots and ships. \"Don't forget about the extra supply ships,\" said the first one, trying to keep a straight face. \"Sorry, I'm being silly. We have a few, erm, off-the-books deliveries every now and again. They deliver what the company won't, if you catch my drift. One of them might take you, if you're not too picky about who you fly with.\" Jack glanced out at the automata still trying to fix the Adeona at the end of the street. \"Oh, believe me – I'm not. Thanks, guys.\" \"Don't mention it.\" His spirits lifted, Jack took his cup of water and strolled back over to the porch. He sat down at one of the few tables still in the shade of the awning and soaked in the rainforest vista before him. He couldn't believe the view could ever grow old. Mixed amongst the trunks of great trees were spiny plant leaves the size of hippopotami and vines as thick as an anaconda. Bugs darted from one vibrant blossom to another. From somewhere far behind the tree line burst tremendous geysers of water, which, at their greatest height, evaporated and sprinkled back down upon the bushy canopies in a fine mist. Each aquatic explosion was accompanied by a distant, thunderous boom. And yet even that wasn't the most impressive sight. Although the sky of Haldeir-B was a similar blue hue to Earth's, most of it was interrupted by the monstrous orange presence of its host planet. It dwarfed the moon’s mountain ranges and swallowed its entire horizon. Jack watched storms swim across its angry surface and wondered how many Earths could be squeezed into the eye of each one. He wished Amber could have been there to see it, too… minus all the \"being stranded on an alien planet\" business, of course. If he could find his way back home and share the secrets of faster-than-light travel with Earth's scientists, maybe the two of them could come back one day. Together. For a vacation, or something. Maybe. A small silhouette came waddling towards him. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\" said Tuner. \"Very. How come you're not over there fixing the ship?\" \"I've done my bit.\" He hopped up into the chair opposite Jack. \"My specialty is digital systems, not hull repair. I thought I'd come say goodbye before we leave.\" \"How kind of you.\" Jack sighed and shook his head. \"I'm sorry, Tuner. It's not your fault your crew is leaving me behind. I should be thankful, really. I'd be dead if it weren't for you.\" \"That's all right. Did you know that skip drives deactivate if there's any chance of the ship colliding with an object of significant mass? You weren't big enough for that, but you did show up on our radar. If we hadn't stopped, we might have gone straight through you.\" \"Well, at least it would have been quick.\" \"I told 11-P-53 that we had a moral duty to stop for anyone in need of our assistance.\" Tuner puffed his metal chest out. \"I imagine your captain would have been much happier turning me into an intergalactic smear,\" said Jack. \"Don't take it personally. I know that not all fleshies are bad, but some of the others… well, some of them have a hard time trusting people. You wouldn't blame them if you knew what they'd been through.\" Jack nodded towards the ship. \"What about Rogan? What's her deal?\" \"RX-1150? She's not mad at you. Not really. She's just worried about everyone, that's all.\" \"Sorry, what I mean is: what has she been through?\" \"Oh.\" Tuner also turned to look at Rogan. \"She's been around for quite a while. Gone through a few owners, I think. She liked one of them. He treated her more like a friend than a thing. But that was a very long time ago.\" \"What did she do?\" \"Before being stolen to work on Charon's superstructure, you mean? Personal Assistance. Like a secretary, or a data server, only much fancier. No need to write anything down when you've got an RX model following you everywhere like a walking, talking encyclopaedia. But she's a custom build. There's nobody else like Rogan.\" \"That doesn't sound too bad. What about you?\" Tuner wriggled uncomfortably in his seat. \"I was built for server maintenance,\" he said, \"but the crew that bought me, they… well, they modified me a bit. I was made to do a lot of hacking before the Rakletts hijacked our ship and killed everyone.\" \"Ha! I didn't realise you were such a badass.\" Tuner hung his head. \"Didn't have much choice. None of us do. If we don't do what we're told, we get scrapped. So we do what we're made for, day in and day out, until one day we get scrapped anyway.\" \"Yeah, I guess that sucks. But it can't be like that for all of you, can it?\" Tuner peered over Jack's shoulder at the Dryggs sitting in the bar. \"They seem friendly enough, right? Nice people?\" Jack glanced over at them and nodded. \"Sure, they seem that way.\" Tuner pointed down the other end of the street, away from the Adeona. \"If you head that way, you should come across an iridium mine,\" he said. \"It's what this town was built for. Pay it a visit. I bet my right leg it's as bad as everywhere else.\" He hopped down from his chair. \"Right, I'd better be off. Wouldn't want the crew to leave me behind.\" \"Oh, of course not. That would be terrible.\" Tuner waved goodbye. Jack waved back. \"Good luck, buddy,\" he said. Jack watched Tuner waddle back out into the baking sun. There was no point denying it – he was going to miss the little guy. His cup was almost empty. He finished what was left and went back to watching the view. Then he sighed. This was going to be a long six days. He looked over at where Tuner had pointed, towards the sheer face of a red and rocky outcrop, then back down at his empty metal cup. He stood up and tucked his chair in. Why not? It was something to do. * * * The walk to the mine took no more than a couple of minutes. The main street petered out into a thinner dust trail, flanked to either side by the same dense, tropical foliage that threatened to swallow the rest of the small settlement. Jack reached the end of the trail and brushed aside a couple of overgrown leaves. The entrance was carved into the bottom of a dusty red cliff face. A couple of Drygg guards sat on old crates to the right of it, playing some sort of card game. They barely looked up at Jack as he approached. \"Er… mind if I take a look around?\" The two guards looked at one another, then shrugged. \"Knock yourself out,\" said one of them, dealing a fresh hand. Jack continued onwards. See? The Dryggs seemed nice enough. Too friendly if anything. Tuner didn't know what he was talking about. He followed a long slope down into the depths of the mine. Metal girders and protective nets lined the interior, though the cut of the rock was so smooth and precise that Jack couldn't imagine anything ever falling loose. An endless wire looped along the ceiling – every few metres or so, a dim light shone from it like a firefly. Jack had expected the tunnel to be cooler than the rainforest outside. Yet the further he walked into the mine, the hotter the air seemed to get. It was like walking into an oven. Hell, it was like walking into a planet’s core. Sweat trickled down the back of his neck. His tongue turned to sandpaper. Blood pounded in his temples. He was seconds away from turning back when he caught sight of the tunnel's end. He staggered on, clutching at the nets on the walls for support until he reached the bottom. Huh. No wonder he felt so hot. An enormous cavern lay before him. Huge stalactites grew out from the ceiling and dripped into pits of lava bubbling in the rocky floor below. The air swam and danced in a thick haze. Automata were everywhere. Some drilled into the walls and cracked the rocks free. Others took those rocks and chiseled the iridium out of them. A third set carried trolleys of the precious element across treacherous natural bridges to conveyor belts on the other end of the cavern. The Dryggs stood beside each station and watched. Jack finally realised what their bulky white armour was for. Aside from preventing their exoskeletons from getting scratched by falling debris, their light, reflective colour made them stand out like safety vests in the dark cavern. Jack could understand why someone would choose to make automata do the work in such an inhospitable environment. He presumed the appropriate model for the job didn't feel the heat the same way a \"fleshy\" might. Using automata as a source of cheap labour was undeniably unfair, but, at the end of the day, it amounted to a job – no different from any other. It didn't seem half as bad as Tuner had made out. An automata pushing a trolley of iridium across the cavern slipped on a spot of wet rock. Its precious cargo went tumbling into the lava. A furious Drygg marched over and threw the poor, protesting robot in after it. Ah. Jack raised a hand to his open mouth. Scratch that. It was worse. He turned around and began the slow climb back up the slope. Behind him, the Dryggs dragged a replacement automata out from storage. Okay. He got it now. He got it. The population of the galaxy didn't view the automata as second-class citizens, or even as slaves, because the galaxy didn't view them as people at all. An automata was a product, no different from a data pad, or a self-driving car, or a glorified toaster. If it didn't work, you threw it away and got a new one. No wonder the crew of the Adeona were desperate to find that Detri place… even if it was just a fairy tale. If the whole universe saw him as disposable, he'd probably feel the same. His eyes stung from the sweat and heat. He rubbed them with his knuckles and blinked heavily. A small rectangle of daylight peered down at him from the top of the slope. He pressed on, panting and wheezing. The air grew cooler as he climbed, but the suspicion that he was on the verge of passing out remained. Well, the best of luck to the Adeona and her crew. It was probably a good thing they were going their separate ways. It wasn't as if he could do anything to help. He wasn't in a position to help any of them, really. He felt bad, but he had his own battles to fight. Like getting back to the bar, for starters.",

      "content": "12 Ode Vadasz, Bounty Hunter Ode Vadasz set the Black Arrow down on a dusty, rocky steppe not far from the small mining settlement. He hopped out of the cockpit and kicked an inquisitive rodent away from his ship. Standing at the edge of the steppe, he shielded his eyes with a leather-gloved hand. Haldeir-B. Hot, sticky and with a gravitational pull just shy of comfortable, Ode could have named half a dozen moons around the planet better suited for an emergency pit stop. But he supposed it could have been worse. Smaller populations meant fewer witnesses. He knelt down and pulled a pair of binoculars out from within the depths of his cloak. Where were they? After some focussing and adjusting, he spotted the Adeona's hull poking out above the tree line a few clicks west. He made a mental note of the rooftops between the ship and what looked like a rudimentary mine. A Drygg guard patrolled a landing pad on top of the red cliff above. Ode reckoned she was too far away to be a problem. A good start, but he needed a better view. He walked back to the ship and yanked open a compartment. Inside was a small, black puck not dissimilar to the disrupter mine he'd fired before. This one, however, had an antenna built into the top of its head, which Ode promptly extended. The puck rose into the air, spinning and beeping. It stopped a few feet above his head before extending a pair of tiny stabiliser wings. Then it waited. Ode smirked to himself. The old automata were the best. They didn't think unless they were told to. He double tapped a panel strapped to his left forearm. A holographic video screen leapt out. It was a camera feed from the drone – he could see himself in its picture. He entered a few co-ordinates into the panel, and the drone jetted off over the treetops. It arrived at the Adeona eleven seconds later. It hung back, dropped between the branches of the dense tree canopies where it wouldn't be seen, and watched. The disrupter mine still clutched the ship's backside like a barnacle. A small, gangly automata clambered over the hull and tried to pry it free with a makeshift crowbar. After a lot of straining, the mine remained where it was and the robot got catapulted off the landing pad. Ode sighed. This wouldn't be difficult. He piloted the drone over the top of the dock and down the street. It was a town of store clerks and off-shift miners, and otherwise as empty as he'd hoped. With any luck, he'd be in and out of that dump before any of the locals figured out what was happening. Not that it mattered if they did, of course. He just preferred to keep things clean. Ode was about to return the drone to the ship when he caught sight of something out of place. He guided it further down the street and zoomed in on the anomaly. A strange man in a cumbersome spacesuit emerged from a path hidden amongst the dense foliage and staggered towards the only bar in town. He appeared to be sweating profusely. Ode squinted at the shimmering hologram. He recognised the man stumbling down the street – not to mention a couple of the automata tending to the ship – from all the commotion back on Kapamentis. The spaceport had been busy, but in his line of work it paid to have an eye for detail. He lit a fresh cigarette and took a long drag. His client hadn't mentioned anyone besides the bolt-buckets. They were the bounty, not the man. Still. Any and all threats had to be dealt with, one way or another. He took control of the drone again. Nobody noticed it pass over the roof of the general store any more than they did the great birds that glided silently across the alien sky. Nor did anyone see it descend into one of the settlement's dark and narrow alleys. There it hovered, waiting on standby. Ode double tapped the panel on his forearm and the hologram vanished. He took another drag on his cigarette. Boy, was this a strange gig. Ten thousand credits was a lot of money. Not a fortune, but certainly far more than a ramshackle crew of obsolete automata was worth. There had to be something else – the true bounty – stashed away on that ship. He inspected the twin revolvers on his belt, admiring the way the sun danced across their silver barrels. Then he flicked his cigarette off the edge of the steppe. He would set off a beacon once he had the ship and its crew in his possession, as was expected. Ode grinned. It would be a terrible shame if any precious cargo went missing before his client got there.",

      "title": "Showdown on Haldeir-B",
      "content": "13 Showdown on Haldeir-B Jack nursed his third complimentary cup of water, having downed the second immediately upon returning to the Drygg bar. Each tasted even better than the last. The longer he sat there by the counter, the less severe his headache became. He hoped it wasn't heatstroke. He doubted there was a decent hospital for lightyears. His skin felt all sticky. His hair clung to his forehead. And he was pretty sure his sweat had formed into pools inside the legs of his spacesuit. He hadn't spoken to anyone since he got back from the mine – not the bartender (aside from to ask for more water), nor the Drygg couple still sitting and drinking together. After what he'd seen going on down there, he didn't particularly feel like making conversation. Neither had any more automata come to say goodbye. A quick glance over in the direction of the Adeona told Jack they were no closer to leaving the moon than he was. On the contrary – if her wild gesticulations were anything to go by, Rogan was more frustrated than ever. He felt like he should go help… but what on earth did he know about disrupter mines and skip drives? Besides, they'd made it perfectly clear they didn't want him getting in the way. Thirty-seven different bottles of brightly coloured liquid stood in a line on the shelf behind the bar. He knew because he'd counted them all. Twice. He tapped his fingers against the counter and started to count them again. The bar could have done with some music. Once this headache cleared, he was going to get really bored. Something hard and blunt jabbed into his side. Jack looked down. The blood ran out of his face. A gun was digging into the soft, elasticated material that sealed the two plastic halves of his spacesuit together. A very fancy gun, for that matter. It resembled an old revolver, complete with rotating chamber and hammer. Although its colour was a dark sort of silver, it was carved with blue alien runes and made from a material Jack had never seen before. A gloved hand held the gun. It looked… normal. Jack raised his head to look his potential assailant in the eye. Much to his surprise, the man had two of them. They were the usual size and shape, with striking blue irises. His jaw was chiseled and lined with tired stubble. He had ears. Normal ears. He was so familiar and ordinary, Jack almost had a heart attack. \"Are you a human?\" he whispered, for a moment forgetting about the gun pointed under his ribs. \"From, you know, Earth?\" \"Never heard of it,\" said Ode, speaking out the corner of a sneer. His breath smelled of old tobacco. \"Don't speak unless I tell you. And don't lie either, unless dripping from the walls is your idea of a good time.\" Jack tried to swallow but his throat was too dry. He turned to face the bar and nodded quickly. \"Good,\" said Ode. The Drygg bartender wandered over, paying neither of them much attention. \"Hey there,\" he said, polishing another metal cup. \"What can I do—\" \"Best if you leave us alone for a few minutes,\" said Ode, making no effort to conceal the threat in his voice. The bartender looked first at the bounty hunter, then down at his gun, and then hurried back to the other end of the bar. \"What's your business with that flying scrapyard outside?\" said Ode. \"The Adeona? No business. No business at all.\" Ode thumbed back the hammer of his gun. \"What did I tell you about lying?\" \"I'm not lying, I swear!\" Jack felt himself start to sweat again. \"I'm not with them – not anymore. I don't even know them really. I was adrift in space and they picked me up, that's all. They let me hitchhike as far as Kapamentis but somehow, in all the chaos and the shooting, I ended up back on their ship. I'm starting to wish I hadn't. Seriously – whatever trouble they're in, I've got nothing to do with it.\" \"Then why are you still here?\" \"I don't have a ship.\" Jack shrugged in as passive a way as possible. \"Believe me, I'd be long gone if I did.\" Ode studied him for a few tense seconds and then relaxed his gun. \"Okay. Keep talking. What have those bolt-buckets got on their ship that's worth so much?\" Jack's brow furrowed. \"On the ship? Nothing that I saw. Then again, I wouldn't notice something valuable round here even if it were shoved up my nose.\" \"There must be something,\" said Ode, rubbing his thumb across the runes on his revolver. \"Nobody pays ten thousand credits for a bunch of old automata.\" Jack's blood turned cold. Of course. Gaskan Troi had sent the bounty hunter after the rogue automata… but the hired gun didn't know that the real target was the folder of stolen blueprints stashed in Tuner's hard drive. He quickly shook his head. \"Nope, nothing springs to mind. But like I said, I'm not really the best person to ask.\" \"Well, it won't take long to find out. Those bots will talk quick enough if they know what's good for them.\" He slipped his gun back into a holster on his hip. \"Speaking of which… don't try anything stupid. Nobody's after you, and I'd rather not waste the ammo.\" Jack's stomach shrivelled up like a rotten apple. \"What are you going to do?\" he asked, slowly turning around on his stool as the bounty hunter went to leave. \"Don't you worry about that.\" Ode's black boots clomped against the dusty floor. \"You've got nothing to do with it, remember?\" \"Wait.\" Ode paused. His hand hovered inches from his hip. The Drygg couple, who'd been sitting at their table watching everything unfold in terrified silence, shrank into their chairs. \"I don't suppose there's any chance you could take me off this rock when you leave, is there?\" Ode let out a single dry laugh. He reached into a pocket inside his cloak and then flicked a silver coin in Jack's direction. Jack caught it. \"I'm nobody's chauffeur,\" he replied. \"But here – buy yourself a proper drink.\" With that, the bounty hunter marched out of the bar. Everybody breathed a collective sigh of relief. Jack opened his hand. The coin was old and chipped around the edge. It carried a faint insignia – an official-looking emblem of planets and stars. He didn't know if it was worth one credit or a hundred. Or what the exchange rate was, for that matter. He put it down on the counter and stared at it. Or rather, he stared through it. He felt like throwing up. The automata had no clue what they were up against. They had no defences, no plan, no way out. They couldn't stand up to a strong breeze, let alone an experienced bounty hunter. He thought about Rogan and Tuner being delivered into the skeletal hands of that creep Gaskan, and his heart sank. The thought of them being broken down for parts made it plummet further still. But there was nothing he could do. He continued to stare at the coin. There was nothing he could do. It wasn't his fight. It wasn't his problem. And he was just a cruddy engineer much too far from home. So why did he get the feeling he was about to do something incredibly stupid? * * * Ode Vadasz marched down the dirt street, the glare of the sun warming the cloak on his back. The automata still busied themselves around the rear of their ship, more desperate and flustered than ever. He shook his head. Idiots. Nobody paid him any notice as he climbed the short set of steps up to the landing pad. He pulled one of his revolvers out from its holster, raised it into the air, and fired. The resulting boom silenced the whole settlement. All of the automata froze in their tasks. Feathered birds and winged reptiles took flight from the treetop canopies. Now he had their attention. He tapped at the panel on his forearm. The drone he hid earlier rose up from the secluded alley beside the general store. It drifted over everyone's heads and settled a couple feet above the hull of the Adeona. \"Thank you for your attention,\" said Ode, nodding at the stunned robots. \"If you'd—\" The dock administrator with whom 11-P-53 had been having a heated discussion came sprinting around from the front of the ship, a plasma rifle clutched in his hands. Ode spun round and fired a single shot. It hit the Drygg right between the eyes, fracturing its horn. The alien's lifeless body rolled off the landing pad into the dirt below. Ode turned back to the automata. \"Sorry about that,\" he said in a voice completely devoid of remorse. \"As I was saying. I have been commissioned to apprehend the crew of this ship\"—he gestured to the Adeona—\"and keep you detained until my client gets here. No, I do not know his name. No, I do not know your names. And no, I don't care why this is happening to you. Arrange yourselves into an orderly line.\" The automata remained frozen to the spot. Ode sighed and raised his revolver again. \"How difficult do you want to make this? Now.\" Everybody shuffled forward. There were sixteen or seventeen of them in total, from stocky, retro cuboids, to skinny models like 11-P-53, to little Kansas down at the far end. They waited obediently. There wasn't much else they could do. Tuner reached up and squeezed Rogan's hand. \"Good work.\" Ode tapped away at his arm-panel again. \"If you all do as you're told, there's no reason anyone needs to be hurt.\" The drone above the Adeona dropped down and latched itself onto the ship's hull. A tiny red light on the tip of its antenna began to blink. The beacon was active. He tapped another combination of keys. Rogan watched in disbelief as the disrupter mine they'd spent so long trying to dislodge disengaged itself from the ship's thrusters and rocketed back into the bounty hunter's hand. \"I'll take that,\" said Ode, hooking it onto his belt. \"What's Gaskan paying you?\" said a nervous 11-P-53. \"We can beat it.\" \"We'll see about that,\" said Ode, winking at the robot. \"Any more of you inside that ship?\" 11-P-53 looked each way down the line of automata, then shook its head. \"I think this is all of us.\" \"For your sake, I hope you're telling me the truth. We've still got a while before this 'Gaskan' of yours gets here. I'd hate to have to kill anything other than time.\" He paused as if he'd heard something nobody else could. Then he sighed. \"Speaking of which…\" The proprietor of the general store came barging out through its door. He was older than the other Dryggs in the settlement. His carapace was bleached and scarred. Judging by the ancient rifle in his hands, he hadn't come out to sell Ode a souvenir. \"Head on back inside, old man,\" said Ode, sneering. \"Before you—\" The old beetle was quicker than he looked. He fired off a round from his rifle. Unfortunately, his aim wasn't quite as spritely as his reflexes. It missed Ode by a good foot and a half, passed over a surprised automata's head and burned a hole through a giant fern on the other side. Ode didn't make that sort of mistake. He fired twice, just to be certain. The first round hit the armour on the Drygg's chest, burning a slow hole through the top layer but nothing more. The second was a headshot. It lifted the old man off the ground and carried him halfway down the street. He landed with a heavy thud. His rifle skidded through the dust and dirt. \"Shame,\" muttered Ode, growing impatient. He spun around and aimed his smoking handgun at the box-shaped automata in the middle of the line. \"What's so valuable on your ship?\" he snapped. \"What are you hiding?\" The cuboid shrank away from the gun. \"Nothing,\" it whimpered. \"We're—\" Ode fired. A shrapnel cloud of computer chips exploded out the back of the robot's torso. The other automata screamed and clutched one another. The cuboid crashed to the ground and shut down. \"Let's hope he wasn't important,\" said Ode, continuing down the line. He stopped at 11-P-53 and levelled his revolver at its head. \"Ten thousand credits. What have you got worth that much?\" * * * Jack watched these events unfold from a crouched position behind the bar's most front-facing wall. He hadn't even left the shade of the awning before the bounty hunter fired off his first shot, killing the Drygg administrator. Then the store owner had come out… and now there were two dead Dryggs. Everything had gotten way out of hand. He glanced over his shoulder. The alien couple who'd been drinking together were hiding behind an upturned metal table. The bartender was nowhere to be seen. Jack realised that he was instinctively looking around for a telephone with which to call the authorities. He didn't even know if there were authorities on Haldeir-B, or anywhere else in the star system, or the whole damn galaxy for that matter. If there were, he suspected they were the ones already lying dead in the street. The best he could do was stay quiet and hope everyone forgot about him. He suspected they already had. And yet… And yet with each passing second, he felt more sick. More responsible, somehow. As if he had personally put a price on the automata's heads, or pointed the bounty hunter in their direction, or done something for which he could possibly be blamed. But he hadn't done anything, except make it abundantly clear that he and the crew of the Adeona were not affiliated in any way. Which was true. In fact, it was more than true – it was what the automata wanted. But he hadn't done anything. Those words wouldn't budge from Jack's mind. Now he was angry as well as scared. What the hell was he supposed to do? Yet another gunshot rang out. Jack jerked his head out of cover just in time to witness one of the robots on the landing pad topple over, dead, a visceral hole blown right through its middle. His heart threatened to beat right out of his chest. Bile crept up his throat. He dropped back into cover, covered his head with his hands, and started to rock back and forth. This was bad. This was so bad. He had to do something. He peered around the wall again. The bounty hunter walked down the line of automata and paused beside 11-P-53. Jack felt his guts twist. As much as he disliked the little twerp, he didn't want to see 11-P-53 blown into a million tiny pieces. He had to do something. Think! The dead Drygg was slumped against the porch of his general store. But his rifle lay in the middle of the deserted street. Nobody was even looking at it. Oh, no. That was a terrible idea. He'd fired all manner of guns before – it had formed part of his pilot training. From the look of the alien rifle, it followed the same general principles. Pull the trigger, something deadly comes out. How difficult could it really be? Jack watched as the bounty hunter pointed his revolver at 11-P-53's head. He was right. It was a terrible idea. And he was going to do it anyway. Jack sprinted out from under the cover of the awning, his head down and his eyes almost closed. His whole body was tense. He expected to be shot and killed at any moment. He wasn't. He snatched up the rifle, almost crashing through the dirt as he did so, and fumbled with it as he tried to get it pointing in the right direction. When he did, he found Ode staring back at him. \"Are you sure you want to do that?\" asked Ode, gritting his teeth. \"Get your hands up where I can see them!\" said Jack, his voice breaking. \"Let the automata go, or I'll shoot. I mean it!\" Ode grinned and raised his hands as if surrendering. The revolver dangled loose from one of his fingers. Then he twisted the buckles that held his cloak around his neck. The cloak spilled to the ground and Ode lowered his arms again. All four of them. \"Not a human, then,\" said Jack, mostly to himself. \"Not a human,\" confirmed Ode. His three empty hands each plucked a revolver from the holsters on his hips. \"You should have bought yourself that drink, you know.\" \"Yeah, probably.\" His hands were shaking. \"Now scram, before things get any worse.\" Ode walked down the steps of the landing pad, laughing and shaking his head. \"You know, you've made this day much more interesting than it needed to be.\" He came to a stop at the foot of the street. \"How about we make this a fair fight? Shoot on the count of three?\" Jack wasn't sure how that swung the odds of survival in his favour exactly, but whatever. He already figured his chances were zero either way. \"Sure,\" he said, swallowing hard. \"Good. Three.\" Ode fired a single shot. Jack flew backwards and landed face-down in the dirt. * * * Ode holstered all but one of his revolvers. \"Idiot,\" he said, shaking his head. He started to walk towards the body, then paused. He spun around and glared at the automata. \"Anyone who moves gets turned into copper confetti,\" he said. The automata continued to whimper and clutch at one another. Tuner hung his head low. Rogan squeezed his hand all the tighter. Ode continued slowly down the street. The sound of dirt crunching under his boots rang out loud amongst the silence of the settlement. It hadn't been a headshot. He needed to confirm the kill. He approached Jack's body. It wasn't moving. He gave it a kick. Jack rolled onto his back. His eyes were shut. He didn't appear to be breathing. A small, cindering hole had burned through his spacesuit, just above his heart. Still. It didn't hurt to be careful. Ode thumbed back the hammer on his revolver. A deafening roar caught him by surprise. He spun around to see the Adeona's thrusters erupt in twin jets of blue flame. The automata remained lined up where he'd left them. Alarmed, one of his hands darted to the disrupter mine hanging from his belt. \"You said there weren't any more crew members aboard the ship,\" he yelled, pointing the gun at 11-P-53 instead. 11-P-53 raised its hands in the air. \"There aren't,\" it replied. \"The ship is a crew member.\" \"Tell her to stay put!\" \"Oh, she's not going anywhere.\" 11-P-53 ducked down. \"She's just trying to distract you.\" Ode's face fell. He spun back around, gun drawn. It was too late. A plasma bolt ploughed through the centre of his chest, leaving behind a smoking hole the size of a tennis ball. Ode blinked twice then fell to the dirt, dead. * * * Jack dropped the plasma rifle and clawed at the hole in his spacesuit. Whatever he'd been shot with had burned through to his skin. He let out an agonising groan. The automata broke from their line the moment the bounty hunter fell. Some fled to the relative safety of the Adeona's loading ramp. Others ran to where Jack lay. \"That was amazing,\" said Tuner, the first to arrive by his side. \"How did you know he wouldn't shoot you in the head?\" \"I didn’t.\" Jack gritted his teeth and screamed. \"God, I'm starting to wish he had.\" \"He used a corrosive round,\" said Rogan, peering into the jagged, smoking hole. \"We need to get the suit off him and treat the wound before it goes any deeper.\" Jack let out another groan. \"Well, we can't hang around here much longer,\" said 11-P-53. Dryggs were emerging from the buildings all around. They didn't look pleased. \"Get him on the ship, quickly.\" Rogan, Tuner and a chunky robot Jack didn't recognise lifted him off the ground and carried him towards the Adeona. Being carried hurt even more than lying on the ground. It felt as if somebody was putting out a cigarette on his body… only instead of having its embers extinguished, the cigarette was tunnelling through his skin. By the time they reached the top of the loading ramp, the pain had grown intolerable. Sweat poured off him in thin tributaries. Screw the cigarette analogy – somebody had tossed him in a bloody furnace. The Adeona lurched off the landing pad, leaving a bitter moon behind.",

      "content": "13 Showdown on Haldeir-B Jack nursed his third complimentary cup of water, having downed the second immediately upon returning to the Drygg bar. Each tasted even better than the last. The longer he sat there by the counter, the less severe his headache became. He hoped it wasn't heatstroke. He doubted there was a decent hospital for lightyears. His skin felt all sticky. His hair clung to his forehead. And he was pretty sure his sweat had formed into pools inside the legs of his spacesuit. He hadn't spoken to anyone since he got back from the mine – not the bartender (aside from to ask for more water), nor the Drygg couple still sitting and drinking together. After what he'd seen going on down there, he didn't particularly feel like making conversation. Neither had any more automata come to say goodbye. A quick glance over in the direction of the Adeona told Jack they were no closer to leaving the moon than he was. On the contrary – if her wild gesticulations were anything to go by, Rogan was more frustrated than ever. He felt like he should go help… but what on earth did he know about disrupter mines and skip drives? Besides, they'd made it perfectly clear they didn't want him getting in the way. Thirty-seven different bottles of brightly coloured liquid stood in a line on the shelf behind the bar. He knew because he'd counted them all. Twice. He tapped his fingers against the counter and started to count them again. The bar could have done with some music. Once this headache cleared, he was going to get really bored. Something hard and blunt jabbed into his side. Jack looked down. The blood ran out of his face. A gun was digging into the soft, elasticated material that sealed the two plastic halves of his spacesuit together. A very fancy gun, for that matter. It resembled an old revolver, complete with rotating chamber and hammer. Although its colour was a dark sort of silver, it was carved with blue alien runes and made from a material Jack had never seen before. A gloved hand held the gun. It looked… normal. Jack raised his head to look his potential assailant in the eye. Much to his surprise, the man had two of them. They were the usual size and shape, with striking blue irises. His jaw was chiseled and lined with tired stubble. He had ears. Normal ears. He was so familiar and ordinary, Jack almost had a heart attack. \"Are you a human?\" he whispered, for a moment forgetting about the gun pointed under his ribs. \"From, you know, Earth?\" \"Never heard of it,\" said Ode, speaking out the corner of a sneer. His breath smelled of old tobacco. \"Don't speak unless I tell you. And don't lie either, unless dripping from the walls is your idea of a good time.\" Jack tried to swallow but his throat was too dry. He turned to face the bar and nodded quickly. \"Good,\" said Ode. The Drygg bartender wandered over, paying neither of them much attention. \"Hey there,\" he said, polishing another metal cup. \"What can I do—\" \"Best if you leave us alone for a few minutes,\" said Ode, making no effort to conceal the threat in his voice. The bartender looked first at the bounty hunter, then down at his gun, and then hurried back to the other end of the bar. \"What's your business with that flying scrapyard outside?\" said Ode. \"The Adeona? No business. No business at all.\" Ode thumbed back the hammer of his gun. \"What did I tell you about lying?\" \"I'm not lying, I swear!\" Jack felt himself start to sweat again. \"I'm not with them – not anymore. I don't even know them really. I was adrift in space and they picked me up, that's all. They let me hitchhike as far as Kapamentis but somehow, in all the chaos and the shooting, I ended up back on their ship. I'm starting to wish I hadn't. Seriously – whatever trouble they're in, I've got nothing to do with it.\" \"Then why are you still here?\" \"I don't have a ship.\" Jack shrugged in as passive a way as possible. \"Believe me, I'd be long gone if I did.\" Ode studied him for a few tense seconds and then relaxed his gun. \"Okay. Keep talking. What have those bolt-buckets got on their ship that's worth so much?\" Jack's brow furrowed. \"On the ship? Nothing that I saw. Then again, I wouldn't notice something valuable round here even if it were shoved up my nose.\" \"There must be something,\" said Ode, rubbing his thumb across the runes on his revolver. \"Nobody pays ten thousand credits for a bunch of old automata.\" Jack's blood turned cold. Of course. Gaskan Troi had sent the bounty hunter after the rogue automata… but the hired gun didn't know that the real target was the folder of stolen blueprints stashed in Tuner's hard drive. He quickly shook his head. \"Nope, nothing springs to mind. But like I said, I'm not really the best person to ask.\" \"Well, it won't take long to find out. Those bots will talk quick enough if they know what's good for them.\" He slipped his gun back into a holster on his hip. \"Speaking of which… don't try anything stupid. Nobody's after you, and I'd rather not waste the ammo.\" Jack's stomach shrivelled up like a rotten apple. \"What are you going to do?\" he asked, slowly turning around on his stool as the bounty hunter went to leave. \"Don't you worry about that.\" Ode's black boots clomped against the dusty floor. \"You've got nothing to do with it, remember?\" \"Wait.\" Ode paused. His hand hovered inches from his hip.

Jack caught it. \"I'm nobody's chauffeur,\" he replied. \"But here – buy yourself a proper drink.\" With that, the bounty hunter marched out of the bar.

Alarmed, one of his hands darted to the disrupter mine hanging from his belt. \"You said there weren't any more crew members aboard the ship,\" he yelled, pointing the gun at 11-P-53 instead. 11-P-53 raised its hands in the air. \"There aren't,\" it replied. \"The ship is a crew member.\" \"Tell her to stay put!\" \"Oh, she's not going anywhere.\" 11-P-53 ducked down. \"She's just trying to distract you.\" Ode's face fell. He spun back around, gun drawn. It was too late. A plasma bolt ploughed through the centre of his chest, leaving behind a smoking hole the size of a tennis ball. Ode blinked twice then fell to the dirt, dead. * * * Jack dropped the plasma rifle and clawed at the hole in his spacesuit. Whatever he'd been shot with had burned through to his skin. He let out an agonising groan. The automata broke from their line the moment the bounty hunter fell. Some fled to the relative safety of the Adeona's loading ramp. Others ran to where Jack lay. \"That was amazing,\" said Tuner, the first to arrive by his side. \"How did you know he wouldn't shoot you in the head?\" \"I didn’t.\" Jack gritted his teeth and screamed. \"God, I'm starting to wish he had.\" \"He used a corrosive round,\" said Rogan, peering into the jagged, smoking hole. \"We need to get the suit off him and treat the wound before it goes any deeper.\" Jack let out another groan. \"Well, we can't hang around here much longer,\" said 11-P-53. Dryggs were emerging from the buildings all around. They didn't look pleased. \"Get him on the ship, quickly.\" Rogan, Tuner and a chunky robot Jack didn't recognise lifted him off the ground and carried him towards the Adeona. Being carried hurt even more than lying on the ground. It felt as if somebody was putting out a cigarette on his body… only instead of having its embers extinguished, the cigarette was tunnelling through his skin. By the time they reached the top of the loading ramp, the pain had grown intolerable. Sweat poured off him in thin tributaries. Screw the cigarette analogy – somebody had tossed him in a bloody furnace. The Adeona lurched off the landing pad, leaving a bitter moon behind.",

      "content": "14 Surgery They carried him into his quarters and dropped him on the bunk. Jack winced and sucked in air through his gritted teeth. \"We have to get this thing off him,\" said Rogan, detaching the spacesuit's right arm. \"Hurry!\" Another automata twisted the left arm off, and then Rogan pulled the entire top half of Jack’s spacesuit over his head. Unfortunately, this involved sitting up. Yet another dose of screaming followed. \"Take the suit to the loading bay,\" said Rogan, handing the chest plate to Tuner. \"See what you can do with it.\" Under his suit Jack wore a thin white undershirt – one half of the thermal set he'd changed into before being fitted into the spacesuit. The cotton was charred and black where the bounty hunter's round had burned through. Jack brought his head as far forward as he could. The skin just above his heart was all wrinkled and raw. Blood pulsed out from a deep, open wound. Rogan pushed his head back down before he could start to panic. The same automata who had detached the left arm of his suit now extended a small, pen-shaped laser from its rotund chest. It cut Jack’s undershirt down the middle. Rogan pulled the two halves apart without hesitation. \"Tweezers, now,\" she snapped. Somebody handed her a pair. Another automata extended a long, mechanical arm above the bunk, from which a bright light shone. Jack’s vision started to blur. The pain grew too great. He felt his grip on consciousness begin to slip away. And then Rogan stuck the tweezers in. \"What the hell are you doing?\" he managed to say between tearful cries. \"Pulling the round out.\" Rogan pushed him back down. Two more automata pinned Jack's arms to the bed. \"It'll keep eating away at your flesh unless I remove it.\" The tweezers went back inside. Jack screamed again. It was clear Rogan didn't understand human anatomy all too well. It felt as if she was pinching the arteries of his heart… and not in a poetic, romantic sort of way. \"Got it,\" she said, raising the tweezers triumphantly. Even Jack lifted his head to take a look. The projectile looked like a shotgun slug, only much smaller. A noxious green substance oozed out from holes along its serrated edge. \"Get it off the ship,\" she said, handing the offending item to somebody else. She brought her face closer to Jack's and smiled. \"You're going to be fine, but we have to clean the wound up. This may sting a bit.\" \"Painkillers, please.\" He swatted listlessly at her shoulder. \"Or alcohol. Lots of alcohol.\" She nodded at an automata he couldn’t see. It hurriedly rolled out of the room in the direction of the pantry. \"We'll see what we have.\" Rogan picked up a long hose with a tall, metal canister at one end and a suction cup at the other. \"Half the booze in this galaxy would be worse for you than the bullet.\" \"Not right now they wouldn't. What is that?\" \"This? This is what we're going to clean the wound with. There's still acid to suck out. It's normally used for unblocking the intake manifolds, but don't worry. It's sanitary.\" \"I'm going to die,\" Jack groaned. \"Probably not,\" replied Rogan, switching it on. The pain was indescribable. A cold, grey cloud enveloped him, and then he passed out. * * * When Jack woke again, he did so from a cold and dreamless sleep. The pain had knocked him out – he suspected it was the throbbing ache that had brought him back around again. He gritted his teeth and propped himself up on his elbows. This did not help alleviate the discomfort. A bolt of hot pain shot through his shoulder and across his chest. He collapsed back onto the mattress with a yelp. Scared of what he might see, Jack peered down at the spot where he'd been shot. He let out a whimper. A two-inch scar ran lengthways across his bare chest, only a hair's breadth above his heart. It was thick, pink and a little gnarly – as if the wound had been cauterised rather than sewn shut. There were patches that looked unnervingly smooth and raw. He prodded the scar with his finger and immediately wished he hadn’t. Yet despite the searing pain, he felt an almost hysterical sense of relief. He was still alive. He'd stood up against an intergalactic bounty hunter, and somehow he was still alive! A short-lived smile flashed across his face before he remembered he was still a few trillion miles from home… and had probably just added his name to a homicidal warlord's naughty book. He rolled over as much as his protesting scar would allow and stared out the window of his quarters. There were no planets, no stars, no crimson nebulas. Only a flat and absolute darkness punctuated by the pulsing of midnight blue waves. The Adeona was on the move through subspace. The question was: where was she headed? Jack jumped as the chair beside the window spun around. A pair of glowing yellow eyes bloomed in the darkness. \"Oh good,\" said Tuner. \"You're awake.\" \"Apparently so,\" said Jack, taking great effort to sit up. \"How long was I out for?\" \"A few hours. You passed out during the cleaning. I wanted to wake you up but Rogan told me not to. She said it meant you wouldn't feel the rest of the procedure.\" \"How on earth did she get it to heal so quick?\" Jack caught himself before he could give the scar another prod. \"I would have thought there'd be stitches at least.\" \"Ah, Rogan is plenty used to putting fleshies back together. Her old owner was always getting himself into accidents.\" He pointed at the scar. \"It may not be pretty but, erm, the prognosis is good.\" \"Well, it sure beats having a bullet burn through my chest cavity.\" Jack shivered and crossed his arms, despite the ache. \"I guess I need to find a new shirt.\" Tuner bleeped and hopped off the chair. He hurried over to the other end of the bunk and picked something up. \"That cloth thing you had on was covered in blood, so we threw it out the airlock. But a couple of us had a go at fixing your spacesuit.\" He handed the torso of Jack's spacesuit over. Most of it looked exactly the same, plus or minus a few extra scratches. But the section of thick plastic through which the slug had burned a hole was patched up with two square pieces of scrap metal hastily soldered together. \"I know it doesn't look great, but it should keep the air in if you find yourself floating out in space again,\" said Tuner, sheepishly. \"Though I suppose without a helmet you won’t notice much of a difference.\" Jack slipped the suit over his head and smiled. \"It's wonderful. Thank you.\" Then his smile vanished. \"What happened to the photograph in the pocket?\" He patted and pried at where the compartment on the chest plate had been. \"Where did you put it?\" Tuner bowed his head and held out a scrap of paper. \"There was nothing we could do,\" he said. Jack took the photograph and, as delicately as he could with trembling fingers, unfolded it. What was left of it, at least. \"No no no,\" he groaned, turning it over and over. The corrosive slug had passed through the photograph on its way to his flesh. Amber's smiling face had been completely burned from the picture, as had most of Jack. Plenty of the stunning coastline remained, but beyond that the photograph was nothing but a black, curling crisp. \"I'm sorry,\" said Tuner. \"How is this happening?\" asked Jack, raising his voice. \"Seriously – how is this happening to me?\" \"Don't worry,\" said Tuner. \"You'll get back to Earth and—\" \"No I won't!\" Jack's voice broke as it grew even louder. \"I have no idea where the hell I am, or where I'm going! And if you guys won't help me find Earth, why in this godforsaken galaxy will anyone else?\" He waved the burned photograph in Tuner's face. \"This is all I have of her, do you understand?\" Tears rolled down his face, though he wouldn't realise he was crying until afterwards. \"If I don't get back home, then this is all I have. And now it's gone.\" He laid back down on the bunk and covered his face with his hands. \"I never should have agreed to that damn experiment,” he said. \"And I never should have got myself mixed up in everyone else's mess.\" Tuner bowed his head again. \"Jack…\" \"Go away, Tuner.\" He didn’t remove his hands from his face. \"Please. I just want to be left alone.\" Tuner watched Jack lie there for a moment longer, and then slunk off towards the door. * * * The door opened again a few minutes later. \"I told you before, Tuner,\" said Jack, sitting up. \"I'm not in the mood to see anyone right now.\" He craned his neck, but he couldn't see anybody standing in the doorway. When the door hissed shut again, he relaxed. Then he heard the sound of miniature tank treads rolling across the metal floor. He peered over the side of the bunk and saw Kansas approach the small dresser to the right of him. It was carrying a small metal bowl. \"Erm, hello?\" Kansas came to a stop. It lifted the bowl up onto the top of the dresser using a pair of thin, retractable arms extended from within its cylindrical body. \"In case you're hungry,\" it said in a small, timid voice. A circle of lights flashed around the top of its head. \"Hopefully you like it better than the stuff you ate from that tin.\" \"Oh. Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" He watched as Kansas trundled back out of the room. The door opened and shut behind it. With immense suspicion, he turned his head towards the bowl. He counted nine golden-orange cubes inside. They were perfectly diced, as if prepared by somebody who believes that sustenance ought to follow a strict mathematical formula. They also looked incredibly juicy. His stomach growled just looking at them. Ah, what the hell. He'd survived being shot by a bounty hunter. He couldn't back down from a bit of fruit. He picked up a cube and gently squeezed it. It had a light, spongey texture. He gave it a quick sniff. It smelled citrusy. He popped it into his mouth. For the first half a second, Jack wasn't sure what to make of it. After that, he was certain it was one of the best things he'd ever tasted in his life. It was as if somebody had married together the genes of a mango, a passionfruit, a clementine and – bizarrely – an angel cake, resulting in a beautiful Frankenstein fruit that dissolved like sherbet upon his tongue. He devoured all nine cubes in less than a minute and, much to his surprise, found his hunger immediately quenched. Not long after that, he noticed the pain in his chest had grown a little less intense, too. He wondered if the fruit carried medicinal qualities as well as a perfect flavour. His hysterical urge to trash his quarters had certainly diminished since eating it. There was no point in getting upset or angry. Neither would he get any closer to re-discovering Earth by lying on his bunk feeling sorry for himself. Losing the photograph may have been heartbreaking, but it changed nothing. It certainly didn't make getting back home any less urgent. That said, he’d been indebted to the automata ever since they saved his life. They needed his help if they were to ever make it to Detri. He'd saved them on Haldeir-B, and now their fates were tied… whether Jack liked it or not. It was simple, really. The best way to get back home was to help the automata find a new one.",

      "content": "15 The Ceros Gate The second time Jack woke up in his quarters – having deliberately fallen asleep this time, and having suffered no nightmares of despotic suns – the stars were back outside his window. The Adeona had exited subspace. He sat up on his bunk and marvelled at how much better his chest felt already. A dull ache still lingered, but he could hardly believe he'd been shot only a few hours before. If it weren't for the nasty scar above his heart, he may well have chalked it all up as another bad dream. The arms of his spacesuit had been left propped up against the dresser following his operation. Jack pulled them over each arm and twisted them into position. He felt like he was wearing the spacefaring equivalent of a tank top without them. He stood up, picked up the empty bowl, and carried it out to the pantry. When he found the pantry deserted, he headed for the cockpit instead. All of the automata were crowded around the consoles and hologram table, bickering over what to do. A number of them looked up as Jack entered. 11-P-53 gave him a respectful nod. \"Feeling better?\" asked Rogan, giving him a dry, amused smile. \"Much.\" Jack leaned against one of the terminals. \"What was in that fruit?\" \"You mean the kwagua berry,\" she replied, nodding. \"It's native to the Kw'ek system. The locals grow them for their hallucinogenic qualities, but for most other species, they make for a great painkiller.\" Tuner peeked out from behind the other side of the hologram table. \"How you doing, buddy?\" Jack raised his hand. Tuner enthusiastically waved back. \"So, what's the holdup?\" asked Jack. \"We've stopped, haven't we?\" \"No holdup.\" 11-P-53 pointed out the cockpit's windows. \"We're here.\" Before the Adeona lay a new star system, one more claustrophobic than Jack ever thought possible. All the planets were within visible distance of one another, orbiting a pale blue sun that could have been no bigger than Jupiter. In the middle of it all, half in black silhouette and half cast in shimmering silver-blue by the geriatric sun, was an enormous space station shaped like a stretched-out spinning top. Scores of tiny drones spread out from the station in every direction and at seemingly infinite length, linking together to form a faint, flickering, golden forcefield. \"Here?\" asked Jack, turning back to the automata. \"Where's here?\" \"The Ceros system.\" Tuner pointed at the forcefield. \"And that golden monstrosity is the Ceros Gate.\" \"Why in God's name is everything behind it so… cramped?\" \"It didn't use to be.\" Rogan brought up a flickering blue diagram of a more regular-looking solar system on her hologram table. \"Not until the Negoti Corporation bought it a couple decades back. The system has no species of advanced intelligence, but the planets themselves are unusually rich with minerals – Somnium crystals in particular. But the planets were also very far apart from one another, and the levels of fuel required to bring the unrefined ore to the central processing facility would have dug deep into the company's profits. So the Negoti Corporation cut costs by bringing them all closer together.\" \"What? How?\" \"By dropping artificial gravity wells around the star,\" continued Rogan. The holographic diagram changed to illustrate the trajectory for each of the eleven planets, all spiralling inward towards the centre of the solar system. \"It took about a year for the planets to get as close to one another as they are today, by which point the wells had drained most of the sun's energy too. Which was good for Negoti, as a larger star might have devoured the very planets they were trying to mine.\" Jack looked back out at the planets and asteroids and swarms of spacecraft, all busying around the space station like particles around an atom's nucleus. He shook his head in disbelief. \"They can do that?\" Rogan smirked. \"You won't believe what people can do with a star these days,\" she said. Jack smiled in excitement. They could change the size of a sun – maybe they could fix a dying one, too. Then his expression of wonder transformed into one of concerned puzzlement. \"Wait, did you say Ceros? Isn't that the star system you said you needed clearance codes for?\" \"The one and the same,\" replied 11-P-53. \"Sorry, am I missing something?\" Jack shot a quick glance at Rogan. \"You don't have the codes… do you?\" She went to reply, but 11-P-53 got there first. \"No, we don't. But we don't have enough fuel to change course, either. If we're to reach Detri, we have to continue through Ceros as planned.\" 11-P-53 tilted its head as if daring Jack to argue. He didn't. \"Okay. So what is the plan?\" \"We were just ironing out the last few wrinkles when you joined us.\" 11-P-53 gestured for Tuner to step forward and explain. \"The Adeona is a mining vessel, right?\" said Tuner, wandering around from the other side of the hologram table. \"She might not be the same model of ship as the ones that the Negoti Corporation uses, but I reckon she can blend in amongst the crowd for a short while… providing I scramble Negoti's radar signal, that is. \"Every ship has to pass through the security checkpoint here.\" Tuner pointed at the space station in the centre of the gargantuan golden forcefield. \"Every ship except the cargo trains that carry ore and equipment from one side to the other. They can deactivate sections of the forcefield if they need to. If we're patient we can follow one of them through, bypass the Gate completely, and then skip off into subspace before anyone notices.\" He stood back from the table and looked proud of himself. \"Okay…\" Jack was determined to be as tactful as possible. \"That's not too bad a plan. But it sort of presumes a corporation powerful enough to shrink down an entire solar system has installed an access code system that fundamentally doesn't work. Maybe you can keep the ship hidden while we're still far out, but I bet we get swamped with code requests before we're within even a thousand clicks of that forcefield. And even if we do get through, you can be sure there'll be Negoti ships waiting for us on the other side.\" \"Jack's got a point,\" said Rogan. \"The Ceros Gate is there to make sure rogue mining vessels can't sneak in and steal Somnium crystals from the planets Negoti has paid for. If anything, being a non-approved mining vessel rather than a civilian ship might make us stand out even more.\" \"And maybe I'm wrong about this,\" said Jack, a little more cautiously, \"but doesn't the skip drive boot you out of subspace if you come too close to an object of large mass? Isn't that what you told me, Tuner?\" Tuner nodded, a little embarrassed. \"How would we jump to subspace then?\" Jack pointed at the cluster of planets outside the cockpit's windows. \"Look at that mess. There's barely a spot on the other side that isn't a large mass.\" \"Another good point,\" said Brackitt, spinning around in his chair up front. \"The only clear path into subspace is directly on the other side of that security checkpoint. If we sneak through anywhere else on the Gate, we'll still have to go around the planets before we can make the jump.\" 11-P-53 tapped its metal foot, clearly irritated. \"Like I said, there are still a few details we need to work through.\" Everyone fell silent, thinking. \"Are we safe, floating around out here?\" asked Jack, after a while. \"We're outside the range of their scanners,\" replied Brackitt, nodding. \"Since they shrunk the star system, we're not technically trespassing into its heliosphere. Yet.\" More silent thinking. \"What's this Negoti Corporation like?\" asked Jack, squinting out the windows. \"Any chance they might be sympathetic enough to turn a blind eye?\" 11-P-53 laughed. This time it was Rogan who answered. \"The Negoti Corporation is one of the most powerful and profitable companies in the whole galaxy,\" she replied. \"They're run by the Ghuk, for the most part. Nasty insect humanoids with limited emotional range. And they didn't get where they are today without being just as reliant on automata to pad out their workforce as everyone else.\" \"So that's a no, then?\" \"Unless everyone here wants to spend the rest of their life cracking rocks, that is indeed a no.\" \"So what do we do?\" asked Tuner. \"We can't wait here forever.\" \"We go ahead with the original plan,\" said 11-P-53, boldly marching over to the captain's chair. \"We'll be gone before they even know we're here.\" \"Wait.\" Jack darted to the hologram table. \"Rogan, can you bring up a map of the Ceros system as it looks right now?\" \"This is the most up-to-date one we have,\" she replied. The hologram changed to reflect the scene outside the windows. She enlarged the image with a sweep of her hand. \"It should be reasonably accurate. The planets don't have much of an orbit anymore.\" \"What are you looking for?\" asked Tuner. \"So we have to go through this system, right?\" said Jack, circling the table. \"The Gate is too wide to go around. Yet if we try our luck at the checkpoint, Negoti will either send us back or shoot us down. So what we need is a backdoor or shortcut of some kind – a route that's short enough for our limited fuel reserves, keeps us clear of their radars, and gives us a clean shot into subspace once we're on the other side. Come on, guys. There has to be something.\" Everyone studied the map without much luck. \"This is a waste of time.\" 11-P-53 crossed its arms. \"I don't see anything.\" \"How about through there?\" Tuner pointed at a planet not too far from the central station. Unlike the other planets lurking safely behind the Ceros gate, its decayed orbit had left it floating halfway through the forcefield. \"Aside from a few dozen patrol ships, it looks mostly unguarded. And there's not too much blocking our way out once we're on the other side, either. I know it's a bit close to the security checkpoint, but…\" Rogan zoomed in further. As the image grew more detailed, Jack began to suspect that it wasn't a planet at all, but rather a tight cluster of asteroids. Then, with a dawning sense of both awe and horror, he realised it was a planet – one cracked into hundreds of thousands of chunks, from rocks no greater than a car to a few the size of whole continents. \"What happened to it?\" asked Jack, appalled. \"Negoti blew it apart,\" said Rogan. \"It's the easiest way to get to the precious minerals near the core. There were thirteen planets before they bought the place.\" She spun the hologram around and shook her head. \"This won't work. That forcefield is super tight. It won't have left any gaps around the surface of the planet.\" \"No, not around the planet. Through it.\" Tuner shrugged innocently. \"Hey, you said you wanted to find the shortest route from here to the other side of the Gate. There won't be any forcefield on the inside.\" Everyone took a closer look at the chasms and cracks between floating chunks of dead planet. It was a dark and deadly labyrinth. \"You realise those pieces won't be stationary in real life, right?\" said Rogan. \"They'll be moving in and out, creating new passages and destroying others. Even while they're open, some of those gaps won't be much wider than the Adeona.\" \"She won't be able to plot a course for herself, either.\" Brackitt shook his head. \"Her nav systems are fried and the terrain is too unpredictable. Somebody would have to fly her through manually.\" \"No way.\" 11-P-53 shook its head. \"I can't do it. Besides, it's too reckless. I won't endanger my crew like that.\" \"I'll do it,\" said Jack, quietly. Everyone turned to look at him. \"I can do it,\" he said, a little louder despite his dry throat. \"I trained as a pilot before I became an engineer. Did hundreds of simulations, a few of which involved flying heavy supply ships through some pretty tight gullies.\" \"Simulations?\" asked 11-P-53. \"No actual flights?\" Jack shrugged. His face turned red. \"If I don't crash, what's the difference?\" \"What's the difference?\" 11-P-53 threw its arms in the air. \"What's the difference? You haven't even been in space before, let alone flown through it!\" \"She wants him to do it,\" said Brackitt. Jack and 11-P-53 stopped bickering and turned to face him. So did all the other automata. Brackitt cradled the cable running from his head to the ship's dashboard in his hand. \"Sorry, what?\" asked Jack. \"The Adeona – she says she wants you to fly her,\" said Brackitt, shrugging. \"She thinks you have what it takes.\" 11-P-53 went as if to protest, then thought better of it. \"Well it's her choice, I suppose,\" it said, shaking its head. \"Is everyone else okay with a fleshy taking control of the ship?\" One by one, all of the automata nodded or bleeped in the affirmative. \"Then she's all yours,\" said 11-P-53, disappointedly gesturing to the captain's chair. Jack took a deep breath to steady himself, suddenly aware that everyone's eyes (or lenses, or diodes) were boring into him. The expectant automata backed away from the hologram table, clearing a path to the front of the ship. Jack glanced over at Rogan as he walked down the steps. She gave him a subtle, reassuring nod. Tuner stood by her side, looking up at him with quiet, excited apprehension. He lowered himself into the captain's chair. The leather was thick and heavily cushioned. It was designed for a species slightly larger than a human, yet its soft padding settled to fit the contours of his body. He felt almost cradled within its curved, half-eggshell-shaped frame. It was surprisingly comfortable. \"Be careful with her,\" said Brackitt, leaning across. \"I think she has a crush on you.\" \"What, the ship?\" Brackitt shrugged. Even without a mouth, Jack could tell he was smirking. \"You're the one who called her wonderful, don’t forget.” Jack stared at the smorgasbord of buttons and levers littering the dashboard. He ran his hand along their surface. \"And she is,\" he replied. \"Simply wonderful.\" He clenched his hands into fists to keep them from shaking. This was it. This was everything he ever wanted. All his training at the Academy; all those late nights he spent pushing himself on the sims, desperate to come top of his class; all his dreams dashed when he went backpacking because he couldn't bring himself to fly. Yet here he was, sat behind the wheel of not a jet fighter but an actual spacecraft. Everything – everything – had been leading to this moment. Forget engineering. Forget qualifications. He was a pilot, had always been a pilot… and a damn good one, too. All he had to do now was keep his nerves from flaring up. He steadied himself, pushed one of the levers forward, and led the Adeona out into the Ceros star system.",

      "content": "15 The Ceros Gate The second time Jack woke up in his quarters – having deliberately fallen asleep this time, and having suffered no nightmares of despotic suns – the stars were back outside his window. The Adeona had exited subspace. He sat up on his bunk and marvelled at how much better his chest felt already. A dull ache still lingered, but he could hardly believe he'd been shot only a few hours before. If it weren't for the nasty scar above his heart, he may well have chalked it all up as another bad dream. The arms of his spacesuit had been left propped up against the dresser following his operation. Jack pulled them over each arm and twisted them into position. He felt like he was wearing the spacefaring equivalent of a tank top without them. He stood up, picked up the empty bowl, and carried it out to the pantry. When he found the pantry deserted, he headed for the cockpit instead. All of the automata were crowded around the consoles and hologram table, bickering over what to do. A number of them looked up as Jack entered. 11-P-53 gave him a respectful nod. \"Feeling better?\" asked Rogan, giving him a dry, amused smile. \"Much.\" Jack leaned against one of the terminals. \"What was in that fruit?\" \"You mean the kwagua berry,\" she replied, nodding. \"It's native to the Kw'ek system. The locals grow them for their hallucinogenic qualities, but for most other species, they make for a great painkiller.\" Tuner peeked out from behind the other side of the hologram table. \"How you doing, buddy?\" Jack raised his hand. Tuner enthusiastically waved back. \"So, what's the holdup?\" asked Jack. \"We've stopped, haven't we?\" \"No holdup.\" 11-P-53 pointed out the cockpit's windows. \"We're here.\" Before the Adeona lay a new star system, one more claustrophobic than Jack ever thought possible. All the planets were within visible distance of one another, orbiting a pale blue sun that could have been no bigger than Jupiter. In the middle of it all, half in black silhouette and half cast in shimmering silver-blue by the geriatric sun, was an enormous space station shaped like a stretched-out spinning top. Scores of tiny drones spread out from the station in every direction and at seemingly infinite length, linking together to form a faint, flickering, golden forcefield. \"Here?\" asked Jack, turning back to the automata. \"Where's here?\" \"The Ceros system.\" Tuner pointed at the forcefield. \"And that golden monstrosity is the Ceros Gate.\" \"Why in God's name is everything behind it so… cramped?\" \"It didn't use to be.\" Rogan brought up a flickering blue diagram of a more regular-looking solar system on her hologram table. \"Not until the Negoti Corporation bought it a couple decades back. The system has no species of advanced intelligence, but the planets themselves are unusually rich with minerals – Somnium crystals in particular. But the planets were also very far apart from one another, and the levels of fuel required to bring the unrefined ore to the central processing facility would have dug deep into the company's profits. So the Negoti Corporation cut costs by bringing them all closer together.\" \"What? How?\" \"By dropping artificial gravity wells around the star,\" continued Rogan. The holographic diagram changed to illustrate the trajectory for each of the eleven planets, all spiralling inward towards the centre of the solar system. \"It took about a year for the planets to get as close to one another as they are today, by which point the wells had drained most of the sun's energy too. Which was good for Negoti, as a larger star might have devoured the very planets they were trying to mine.\" Jack looked back out at the planets and asteroids and swarms of spacecraft, all busying around the space station like particles around an atom's nucleus. He shook his head in disbelief. \"They can do that?\" Rogan smirked. \"You won't believe what people can do with a star these days,\" she said. Jack smiled in excitement. They could change the size of a sun – maybe they could fix a dying one, too. Then his expression of wonder transformed into one of concerned puzzlement. \"Wait, did you say Ceros? Isn't that the star system you said you needed clearance codes for?\" \"The one and the same,\" replied 11-P-53. \"Sorry, am I missing something?\" Jack shot a quick glance at Rogan. \"You don't have the codes… do you?\" She went to reply, but 11-P-53 got there first. \"No, we don't. But we don't have enough fuel to change course, either. If we're to reach Detri, we have to continue through Ceros as planned.\" 11-P-53 tilted its head as if daring Jack to argue. He didn't. \"Okay. So what is the plan?\" \"We were just ironing out the last few wrinkles when you joined us.\" 11-P-53 gestured for Tuner to step forward and explain. \"The Adeona is a mining vessel, right?\" said Tuner, wandering around from the other side of the hologram table. \"She might not be the same model of ship as the ones that the Negoti Corporation uses, but I reckon she can blend in amongst the crowd for a short while… providing I scramble Negoti's radar signal, that is. \"Every ship has to pass through the security checkpoint here.\" Tuner pointed at the space station in the centre of the gargantuan golden forcefield. \"Every ship except the cargo trains that carry ore and equipment from one side to the other.

      "title": "Under the Radar",
      "content": "16 Under the Radar Jack took less than three minutes to get to grips with the basics of Adeona's controls. Her setup wasn't quite as intuitive as that of a fighter jet or even one of the United Earth Government's more hefty supply ships, but neither was it too complicated. A lever to his left regulated the strength and speed of her rear thrusters, while a joystick directly in front of him allowed for movement up, down, left and right. Paddles on the second lever activated the air brakes on each side of the ship, which swapped a strafing manoeuvre for a sharper, banked turn. Any kid who'd ever gone near a video game controller could have picked it up. But there were dozens of other buttons and flaps and switches which remained completely alien to him. He didn't even want to know which button activated the skip drive. As they drifted slowly in the direction of the cracked planet, an almighty clanging sound came from inside a panel beneath the ship's dashboard. Tuner poked his head out. \"We're a fair way inside Ceros' heliosphere now,\" he said, referring to the outer limits of the solar system, \"but so far I'm only picking up the faintest traces of Negoti's radar signal. I can scramble it for the time being, but it'll get a lot stronger once we're closer to the Gate.\" \"The Adeona says everything is good so far,\" said Brackitt, nodding like a doctor checking a patient's heartbeat through a stethoscope. \"You can go a bit quicker, if you like.\" Jack was going at the speed he felt most comfortable with, thank you very much. But he knew Tuner couldn't hold off Negoti's radar scans forever, so he gently pushed the left lever further forward. He shouldn't have been surprised when there was no sensation of increased velocity outside the cockpit's windows. The pressure on his chest grew for the most marginal of moments as they accelerated, but the stars remained as static as always, like tiny white flecks of paint on a black canvas. Of course they wouldn't appear any closer. This was nothing like flying across oceans or fields of corn. Most of the time, space couldn't offer a point of reference. Considering the distance from solar system to solar system, and the speeds at which a ship could travel, the stars on the horizon weren't really any closer at all. Unless you used a skip drive, of course. Everett Reeves really hadn't been joking when he said getting to the nearest star could take humanity dozens of lifetimes. No wonder he was so desperate to get the wormhole tech to work. And yet, even without jumping to subspace, the planets beyond the Ceros Gate were growing noticeably bigger as they approached. God only knew how fast the Adeona must have been going. Faster than any ship Earth had ever produced, that was for sure. \"At our present velocity, we should reach Ceros-VI within five minutes,\" said Rogan, monitoring the ship's course on the hologram table. \"Keep on the planet's starboard side as much as you can.\" Brackitt kept the left-hand windows of the Adeona magnified so that everyone could better monitor the Negoti space station, just in case it became alerted of their presence and sent out attack drones. As Jack pitched the Adeona to the right, he marvelled at the queue of supply ships waiting to pass through the checkpoint. \"Kill the engines,\" said Rogan. \"Now!\" Jack didn't even have to press anything – the Adeona did it herself. The levers and joysticks snapped back to their original positions and her thrusters shut down, killing the rumble that permeated through her hull. Even without propulsion, she continued to rocket forward through frictionless space. \"What happened?\" Jack spun the chair around. \"Did I do something wrong?\" 11-P-53 shook its head and marched down the steps to join him. \"Out there,\" it said, pointing out the window. \"Do you see that?\" Jack squinted, then magnified the screen, then increased the brightness. A small, stocky spacecraft was headed towards them. Large filament-bulb searchlights ran along its roof. It had what looked like rocket launchers attached to either side. \"It's a patrol ship.\" 11-P-53 dashed back to the hologram table. \"It must have seen the flare from our engines.\" \"What should we do?\" asked Jack. \"Nothing,\" said Rogan, snapping at him. \"We'll give away our location again if we use our thrusters. Our momentum is still carrying us towards Ceros-VI. The patrol should be headed towards where we were, not where we are.\" \"Won't it see us anyway?\" Rogan paused, then shook her head. \"This far out from the system's star? Probably not. They have lights, but they're for short distance searches. With any luck they'll dismiss the glare from our thrusters as nothing but a reflection bouncing off a piece of space-junk.\" Jack looked back out at the patrol ship. It was definitely getting closer. \"You think that'll work?\" he asked. \"There's no chance we could outrun it?\" \"Sure. We're probably faster.\" \"Then why don't we do that?\" \"Because we can't outrun the missiles it'll fire once it sees us. Now stop talking. And for bolts' sake, will somebody kill the lights and screens?\" Everyone fell silent. Tuner flipped a switch under the dashboard and everything inside the cockpit turned dark. The golden forcefield outside the windows rolled out of frame as the Adeona tumbled lifelessly through space. With each slow rotation of the ship, the security patrol appeared to grow a little nearer. \"Come on,\" whispered Jack, clutching at the leather straps of his captain's chair. Everybody held their breath. Or Jack did, at least – the automata simply froze in their positions, not moving an inch, which he guessed was their equivalent. If the Negoti patrol had even the slightest suspicion that the Adeona was trying to sneak through the Ceros system, it would blow the ship right back out of it – this time in a million different pieces. And nobody would ever come sifting through the wreckage for him. Nobody would even know he'd died out there at all. He went to reach for the photograph, only to remember that it was ruined. Just when it looked as if the patrol was headed on an interception course with the Adeona, it veered off to the right. Jack let out a sigh of relief. Even though it couldn't have been any closer than a kilometre or so away, it felt as if they'd missed each other by mere inches. If they'd been two jet fighters flying in broad daylight, they would have spotted each other for sure. Once the automata were confident the patrol wasn't looping around for another pass, Tuner switched the lights back on. The blue hologram of the solar system popped back up from the table. Rogan studied their new, uncontrolled trajectory with a stern expression. \"Okay, everyone back to their stations.\" She turned and faced Jack. \"Keep the main thrusters off until we reach the planet's upper atmosphere. I've labelled a viable entry point on your NavMap – until then, use the air thrusters if you need to keep the ship steady.\" Jack nodded and spun his chair back round. A flat, green hologram had been superimposed over the windows in front of him. A dotted arrow plotted the best path between the ship and Rogan's suggested destination. Tapping the paddles on either side of the joystick, Jack brought the Adeona back under control. He knew the ship could have done it herself with far less trouble had her navigation systems not been compromised by the disrupter mine, but he appreciated the chance to practice. He was about to fly through the guts of a planet. He needed all the practice he could get. * * * As they broke through the upper atmosphere of Ceros-VI, Jack was filled with a plethora of questions… the most pressing of which were how and why it still had an atmosphere at all. \"More gravity wells,\" said Rogan, standing beside Jack. They both looked down at the planet. \"It's much easier to mine an asteroid or even a moon than it is a whole planet – that's why they crack them apart. But that's quite an explosive procedure, as I'm sure you can imagine. The detonation leaves behind a small artificial gravity well, which keeps the chunks – and with them, the planet's atmosphere – from flying off into space.\" \"Like a miniature black hole?\" asked Jack. Rogan bobbed her head from side to side. \"Sort of… but not really. More like a deep chasm in space-time. Think of a bowling ball on the surface of a trampoline, stretching it down. We might survive the trip inside, but it would take more fuel than we have to get back out. And gravity does weird things to time – who knows what year it would be when, and if, we escaped.\" Jack swallowed hard. \"So we want to avoid the planet's core, then?\" \"What's left of it, yes,\" said Rogan, patting the edge of Jack's seat. \"Best if you stick to following the crust around, if you can. Tuner, how's the signal blocking going?\" Tuner wriggled out from his cubby hole. \"No successful pings yet, but it's getting harder and harder to scramble their radar.\" He sounded stressed. \"We ought to be quick. Their video scanners must surely know something's up by now.\" \"Keep going,\" said Rogan, nodding to them both. She returned to the hologram table before any more questions had the chance to slip off Jack's tongue. He did as she said, gently guiding the Adeona towards Rogan's NavMap destination with only the most minimal use of the ship's thrusters. Their flames were far less visible now that they'd entered Ceros-VI's atmosphere, but they'd hardly go unnoticed by patrols on the lookout for intruders. Uninterrupted, they would reach the planet's surface in less than a minute. Although Ceros-VI still retained an atmosphere, it was thin – a pale, white-blue line on the horizon that barely rocked the Adeona's hull upon entry. There weren't clouds floating in the skies below so much as a thin, blanketing mist, one which occasionally showered the broken planet with light rain but just as often spilled the precious water down through the cracks, where its droplets tumbled longways and lengthways towards the core. The planet rose up to greet him. Colossal green forests waved as if celebrating their arrival. Translucent lakes lay pocketed amongst the trees. Even now, flocks of small birds migrated from one planetary chunk to another. Far from the dusty red rock Jack had thought it would be, the fragments of Ceros-VI were teeming with life. It could have been a paradise, once upon a time. He couldn't understand why anyone would want to destroy such a beautiful thing. \"I thought you said the Negoti Corporation bought the Ceros system because it didn't harbour any life?\" he said to Brackitt. \"It didn't harbour any advanced life,\" replied Brackitt, shaking his head. \"If automata don't have any rights, why would you expect anyone to care about a few trees?\" \"It's terrible.\" \"Welcome to the galaxy.\" Jack could have sworn he heard a hint of exasperated laughter in Brackitt's voice. \"It's a pretty terrible place.\" \"We've been picked up on the radar.\" Tuner suddenly emerged from the maintenance hatch. \"Sorry, everyone. Patrol ships are on their way.\" \"No need to apologise, Tuner.\" Rogan brushed her hologram aside and marched down to the front of the cockpit. \"We figured this would happen sooner or later. Do you know where you're going, Jack?\" \"Sure do.\" \"Is the Adeona ready?\" Brackitt paused, then nodded. Rogan crossed her arms. \"Then let's take her inside.\" Jack guided the Adeona towards the largest chasm Rogan had been able to locate with the ship's scanners – at its mouth, it stretched almost a mile across. For now, it was like riding a scooter down an empty freeway… but they all knew the landscape could change without warning. What was presently a canyon might become a hairline fracture in an instant, crushing whatever foolish ship happened to be passing through. Thick roots stuck out from the soil where the chunks of planet had broken apart. Rocks and dirt came loose where the pieces had recently collided together, falling downwards and inwards. Water spilled out from where underground streams had been cut in half. Jack couldn't see much further than that. Anything deeper than the uppermost level of crust was cast in a thick darkness so black that had it not been for the lack of stars, Jack might not have believed anything lay there at all. He wiped his sweaty hands against the edge of his chair, then tightened his grip on the controls. \"Don't worry,\" said Rogan, noticing the nervous expression on Jack's face. \"By the time they work out what our plan is, we'll be long gone. Nobody would be stupid enough to follow us in there.\" Jack went to swallow but found his throat too dry. That's what he was afraid of.",

      "content": "16 Under the Radar Jack took less than three minutes to get to grips with the basics of Adeona's controls. Her setup wasn't quite as intuitive as that of a fighter jet or even one of the United Earth Government's more hefty supply ships, but neither was it too complicated. A lever to his left regulated the strength and speed of her rear thrusters, while a joystick directly in front of him allowed for movement up, down, left and right. Paddles on the second lever activated the air brakes on each side of the ship, which swapped a strafing manoeuvre for a sharper, banked turn. Any kid who'd ever gone near a video game controller could have picked it up. But there were dozens of other buttons and flaps and switches which remained completely alien to him. He didn't even want to know which button activated the skip drive. As they drifted slowly in the direction of the cracked planet, an almighty clanging sound came from inside a panel beneath the ship's dashboard. Tuner poked his head out. \"We're a fair way inside Ceros' heliosphere now,\" he said, referring to the outer limits of the solar system, \"but so far I'm only picking up the faintest traces of Negoti's radar signal. I can scramble it for the time being, but it'll get a lot stronger once we're closer to the Gate.\" \"The Adeona says everything is good so far,\" said Brackitt, nodding like a doctor checking a patient's heartbeat through a stethoscope. \"You can go a bit quicker, if you like.\" Jack was going at the speed he felt most comfortable with, thank you very much. But he knew Tuner couldn't hold off Negoti's radar scans forever, so he gently pushed the left lever further forward. He shouldn't have been surprised when there was no sensation of increased velocity outside the cockpit's windows. The pressure on his chest grew for the most marginal of moments as they accelerated, but the stars remained as static as always, like tiny white flecks of paint on a black canvas. Of course they wouldn't appear any closer. This was nothing like flying across oceans or fields of corn. Most of the time, space couldn't offer a point of reference. Considering the distance from solar system to solar system, and the speeds at which a ship could travel, the stars on the horizon weren't really any closer at all. Unless you used a skip drive, of course. Everett Reeves really hadn't been joking when he said getting to the nearest star could take humanity dozens of lifetimes. No wonder he was so desperate to get the wormhole tech to work. And yet, even without jumping to subspace, the planets beyond the Ceros Gate were growing noticeably bigger as they approached. God only knew how fast the Adeona must have been going. Faster than any ship Earth had ever produced, that was for sure. \"At our present velocity, we should reach Ceros-VI within five minutes,\" said Rogan, monitoring the ship's course on the hologram table. \"Keep on the planet's starboard side as much as you can.\" Brackitt kept the left-hand windows of the Adeona magnified so that everyone could better monitor the Negoti space station, just in case it became alerted of their presence and sent out attack drones. As Jack pitched the Adeona to the right, he marvelled at the queue of supply ships waiting to pass through the checkpoint. \"Kill the engines,\" said Rogan. \"Now!\" Jack didn't even have to press anything – the Adeona did it herself. The levers and joysticks snapped back to their original positions and her thrusters shut down, killing the rumble that permeated through her hull. Even without propulsion, she continued to rocket forward through frictionless space. \"What happened?\" Jack spun the chair around. \"Did I do something wrong?\" 11-P-53 shook its head and marched down the steps to join him. \"Out there,\" it said, pointing out the window. \"Do you see that?\" Jack squinted, then magnified the screen, then increased the brightness. A small, stocky spacecraft was headed towards them. Large filament-bulb searchlights ran along its roof. It had what looked like rocket launchers attached to either side. \"It's a patrol ship.\" 11-P-53 dashed back to the hologram table. \"It must have seen the flare from our engines.\" \"What should we do?\" asked Jack. \"Nothing,\" said Rogan, snapping at him. \"We'll give away our location again if we use our thrusters. Our momentum is still carrying us towards Ceros-VI. The patrol should be headed towards where we were, not where we are.\" \"Won't it see us anyway?\" Rogan paused, then shook her head. \"This far out from the system's star? Probably not. They have lights, but they're for short distance searches. With any luck they'll dismiss the glare from our thrusters as nothing but a reflection bouncing off a piece of space-junk.\" Jack looked back out at the patrol ship. It was definitely getting closer. \"You think that'll work?\" he asked. \"There's no chance we could outrun it?\" \"Sure. We're probably faster.\" \"Then why don't we do that?\" \"Because we can't outrun the missiles it'll fire once it sees us. Now stop talking. And for bolts' sake, will somebody kill the lights and screens?\" Everyone fell silent. Tuner flipped a switch under the dashboard and everything inside the cockpit turned dark. The golden forcefield outside the windows rolled out of frame as the Adeona tumbled lifelessly through space. With each slow rotation of the ship, the security patrol appeared to grow a little nearer. \"Come on,\" whispered Jack, clutching at the leather straps of his captain's chair. Everybody held their breath. Or Jack did, at least – the automata simply froze in their positions, not moving an inch, which he guessed was their equivalent. If the Negoti patrol had even the slightest suspicion that the Adeona was trying to sneak through the Ceros system, it would blow the ship right back out of it – this time in a million different pieces. And nobody would ever come sifting through the wreckage for him. Nobody would even know he'd died out there at all. He went to reach for the photograph, only to remember that it was ruined. Just when it looked as if the patrol was headed on an interception course with the Adeona, it veered off to the right. Jack let out a sigh of relief. Even though it couldn't have been any closer than a kilometre or so away, it felt as if they'd missed each other by mere inches. If they'd been two jet fighters flying in broad daylight, they would have spotted each other for sure. Once the automata were confident the patrol wasn't looping around for another pass, Tuner switched the lights back on. The blue hologram of the solar system popped back up from the table. Rogan studied their new, uncontrolled trajectory with a stern expression. \"Okay, everyone back to their stations.\" She turned and faced Jack. \"Keep the main thrusters off until we reach the planet's upper atmosphere.

      "content": "17 Journey Through the Cracked Planet The thick, sweeping floodlights of the Adeona cut through the dark and dusty chasm like a broadsword. Large boulders floated in their gaze. Stray rocks and pebbles clattered harmlessly across the ship's hull. So far, so good. Jack hadn't crashed into any of the canyon walls yet, nor any of the rock faces levitating above and below. But controlling the Adeona in such a tight environment was proving harder than he'd anticipated. With her main rear thrusters offline – partly to conserve fuel, partly to save from ploughing into the first corner he came across – the only way he could turn was to fire short bursts from the air thrusters that ran down her flanks. It was nervous, twitchy work. Slow, too. But slow meant safe, and when every narrow corridor felt like a set of hungry cosmic jaws waiting to chow down on them, everybody on board felt that safe sounded pretty damn good. A gargantuan mass of asphalt-grey rock rose sharply overhead. Jack rammed the joystick forward and threw the Adeona into a steep dive. They levelled out just as the skyscraper-sized rock crashed into the cliffs behind them. The thin atmosphere had leaked down from the surface – though they couldn’t hear the impact, they all felt its vibrations. \"I think we've drifted towards the asthenosphere,\" said Rogan. She studied the unusual material with awe. \"Look at the way the molten rock has cooled and hardened having lost the heat from the planet's core. Don't worry,\" she added, \"we're still nowhere near the gravity well. Stick to heading starboard, if you can.\" Jack suppressed a shiver and continued onwards. He was flying through the bowels of a planet that seemed intent on killing him, and his hands were starting to cramp up. Rogan's geology lessons could wait. His interest regarding the landscape changed after a further thirty minutes of flying through stark, monotonous canyons and – depending on the orientation of the ship – narrow slits that letterboxed his vision. When he caught sight of a bright blue glow in the distance, he turned the Adeona towards it without thinking. \"What is that?\" he asked aloud. Brackitt looked up from his dashboard and shrugged. Tuner climbed up from his cubby hole and Rogan adjusted the magnification of her eye lenses. \"I have no idea,\" she replied, her expression blank. Jack was taken aback. Up until then, he'd assumed Rogan knew everything. \"Take us closer if you can, but be careful.\" As the Adeona glided between tight walls of rock, the blue glow grew ever brighter, then divided into two, then the two into four, and so on. At first Jack wondered if they might be some sort of radiant life form – like flying, glow-in-the-dark jellyfish or something. It already felt as if he were piloting the Adeona through the deep blackness of the ocean abyss as it was. But then the lights revealed themselves to be just that – industrial lights, embedded in the side of a massive rock chunk. Small, unmanned ships were boring into it with razor-sharp drills. The rock chunk split. More of the drilling ships swept in, breaking it down further still and syphoning all the precious material through the channels in their drill heads. \"So that's how they do it,\" said Rogan, nodding. \"Interesting. I've never witnessed planetary mining before.\" \"Are they automata?\" asked Jack. \"They're automated, not automata,\" she replied. \"No sentience, no genuine thought. They don't even know they exist. Still, give them a wide berth. We don't know how they communicate with the central station, or what they might tell them.\" \"Will do,\" said Jack, listing the ship to the left. \"Hold on,\" said Brackitt. His voice sounded frantic. He tapped a button and threw a new holographic display across the front windows. \"Does anybody know what that is?\" The green, 3D-matrix image clearly resembled the Adeona as she was at that moment, floating in an ever-shifting labyrinth of rock. Jack guessed the ship was picking herself up on her own short-range scanners. Ahead and to the right of them were the drilling machines. To the left, another empty chasm. Behind them, something was coming in fast. \"A missile,\" said Rogan, her eyes growing wide. She shook Jack by the shoulders. \"Fly, Jack. Fly!\" \"Whose bright idea was it to fly through a bloody planet anyway?\" muttered Jack, throwing the left lever as far forward as it would go. The Adeona rocketed down the chasm to the left, her thrusters suddenly at full power. The rocky corridor was tight – barely twice the width of the ship – and Jack struggled to keep her from bashing off the walls. He suspected the Adeona was helping to stabilise herself as best she could. \"Is it still behind us?\" he yelled over his shoulder. Rogan had moved the scanner hologram over to the table so that it wouldn't impede Jack's view. \"Closer than ever,\" she shouted back. \"Try to lose it.\" \"Try to lose it?\" Jack laughed desperately. \"How? I'm flying in a straight line!\" Rogan spun the map around. \"Go up,\" she said. \"Up?\" \"Now!\" Jack wrenched the joystick towards himself, sending the Adeona groaning upwards. Thanks to the artificial gravity inside the ship, the pressure wasn't half as bad as it would have been in a fighter jet. Only one automata fell over behind its console. The view went from one narrow crack to another. Jack could have sworn that somewhere, far in the distance, he saw a tiny sliver of starlight… but a second later it was gone, blocked out by another roaming slab of planet. Perhaps they were close to the other side. Or perhaps it had only been the light from the Adeona's floodlights, reflecting off a cluster of Somnium crystals. Either way, he was headed in that direction. \"Did that work?\" he shouted. \"No,\" sighed Rogan. He hated hearing defeat in her voice. \"It's still on our tail.\" Jack spotted another crack on his right, and used the ship's airbrakes to drift inside it without slowing. The missile, a video feed of which was now being projected onto one of the windows, followed close behind, its fierce blue flame scorching the walls of rock as it passed. \"Goddammit,\" snapped Jack, taking another sharp turn. \"Who fired a rocket at us this time, anyway?\" \"I don't think anyone did,\" replied Rogan, pointing at the video. \"It looks like a proximity mining torpedo.\" \"Maybe it detected our movement near the dig site and labelled us a loose rock that needs destroying,\" said Tuner. \"Nah, I don't buy it.\" Jack turned once more. He scraped the Adeona's hull against an unexpected outcrop and winced as sparks showered across the windows. \"That rocket is designed for keeping intruders out, not clearing debris. Why else would somebody set explosives around a spot where their own machines are working?\" \"I don't know, Jack! Do you want to pull over and ask?\" Jack went to reply with something unquestionably witty, only for his blood to turn so cold that his words froze in his throat. He mouth gaped open instead. The crack they were following petered to a point too small for the Adeona to pass through. The chunks of planet had collided and locked together. They were headed for a dead end, and the walls were closing in. \"Erm, guys?\" he finally screamed. \"Anywhere on that map of yours?\" \"Only back the way we came,\" replied a distraught 11-P-53. \"I was hoping you wouldn't say that. How far behind us is the torpedo now?\" \"Eighty metres and closing,\" said 11-P-53. \"I should never have agreed to this…\" Eighty metres was only a couple of ship lengths. If he stopped now, the rocket would tear through the back of them in less than a second. He still remembered a few tricks for evading homing missiles from his time at the Academy… but they were manoeuvres to be deployed outside in the open air, not inside a collapsing planet. Did he even have the space? He guessed he was about to find out. Jack plunged the joystick forwards and then, just when the Adeona had begun her suicidal dive, yanked it back towards him. At the same time, he triggered almost half of the ship's air thrusters. This had much the same effect as pulling the handbrake in a speeding car – the Adeona performed a clumsy but immediate one-eighty degree turn, a move impossible through her rear thrusters alone. This time not even the artificial gravity could counteract the pressure of such a turn. Jack's vision went grey as the blood rushed out from the vessels around his eyes. Something in his chest cracked. His head swam and he felt an urgent need to vomit. But there wasn't time to worry about that. The Adeona's sudden reversal in trajectory confused the torpedo's tracking software. It rocketed past the ship, missing it by mere metres. Jack rammed the accelerating lever forwards again, and the ship raced back towards the entrance of the chasm. The mine attempted to correct its own course in the increasingly narrow space, but its turning circle was much too wide. It crashed into one of the walls and detonated. The planetary chunks to either side first cracked and then ruptured, flinging giant pieces of rock in every direction. \"Hold on,\" said Jack, as the Adeona was peppered with burnt earth. He made another sharp, albeit less painful turn out of the chasm's mouth just as it collapsed completely. Jack brought the ship to an abrupt halt a few seconds later. Colour returned to his vision. \"Everyone all right back there?\" he asked. Rogan staggered towards his chair. \"Nothing that can't be buffed out, I hope,\" she replied. \"That was some good flying, Jack.\" \"It was excellent flying,\" said 11-P-53, climbing to its feet. \"But he burned through half our remaining fuel doing it. We'll struggle to get out of this planet, let alone all the way to Detri!\" \"Better than being dead,\" said Tuner, shrugging. \"Tuner's right.\" Rogan crossed her arms. \"Besides, we'll be fine so long as we can make the jump to subspace. We still have enough Somnium left for one last skip, and then we can coast the rest of the way once we're in orbit around Detri.\" 11-P-53 threw up its hands. \"Don't blame me if we get stranded out here,\" it said, marching out of the cockpit. \"I told you we should have tried our luck sneaking through the station.\" \"It wouldn't have worked without the security codes and you know it.\" Rogan waved the cantankerous robot out of the room. \"Don't listen to 11-P-53, Jack. It just wishes it was still sitting in the captain's chair, that's all.\" Jack blushed and bowed his head. Stealing 11-P-53's sense of captaincy had never been his intention. The poor automata was welcome to take it back the moment the Adeona left the system. \"Speaking of which,\" said Jack, half talking to himself, \"let's not hang around. I reckon that gap over there's a way out. I can see something glittery behind it. Might be stars.\" Rogan looked where Jack was pointing. Her eye lenses grew wide again. She took a step back from the dashboard. \"That's not a gap,\" she said, shaking her head, \"and those aren't stars.\" \"Oh.\" Jack shrugged and readjusted the belts of his chair. \"Somnium crystals or something, then. It's worth a shot.\" Rogan reached over and grabbed Jack's hand before he could push the accelerator. She tapped a button in front of him. One of the windows magnified itself three-fold. \"Does that still look like a crystal to you?\" she snapped. Jack had to concede that it did not. He was no expert, but he was pretty sure most crystals couldn't blink. Then again, he'd never believed an eye could be silver or the size of a house, either. \"Now we know who the proximity torpedo was for,\" said Rogan, whispering as if it might hear them. \"We need to turn around very, very slowly.\" \"What the hell is that thing?\" said Jack, his hands frozen. Whatever the creature was, it blinked again… and then rolled its silver eye towards them. \"Big,\" said Tuner. \"Big, and hungry.\" 11-P-53 ran back into the cockpit and shook Jack out of his petrified stupor. \"Screw the fuel reserves!\" it yelled. \"Just get us out of here!\" As soon as Jack ignited the ship's thrusters, the colossal beast lunged after them. It bulldozed through the surrounding rocks as if they were lumps of marshmallow. Jack swung the Adeona around and launched it back the way they came. \"Good grief,\" he screamed, glancing at a video feed from the back of the ship. \"That thing's a monster!\" The darkness around them was near-absolute, but what Jack could see terrified him. Tentacles whipped across the rock faces on either side like steel cables, cutting through the stone. Rows of needle-thin teeth gnashed up and down, each as long as a train carriage, glinting like knives in the brief flashes of floodlight. The rest of its body remained hidden in shadow. There was little doubt that the creature was gigantic enough to devour the ship. The question was, could it manage it in one bite or two? \"Come on, guys. Give me some help here!\" Rogan, Tuner and 11-P-53 were back at the hologram table, swiping through maps of the planet. \"I don't know what to suggest,\" Rogan cried out. \"The pieces of the planet are shifting around too much. It's not as if any of the maps actually match!\" The Adeona's floodlights picked up a rock formation arching between two floating chunks. Jack sent the ship gliding under it. The creature went crashing through it less than a second later. \"Just tell me which side of the planet is closest!\" \"Left,\" shouted Tuner. \"Go left!\" Jack's hands were so sweaty they almost slipped right off the joystick. He yanked it to the left, praying for an exit in that approximate direction. He found one, though not one as early as he would have liked. The Adeona clipped the edge of a rock with a painful crunch. \"Is she all right?\" asked Jack. The ship maintained her breakneck pace. \"She's fine,\" said Brackitt. \"A bit bruised, but nothing a mining ship can't shrug off. Down to six percent fuel, by the way.\" \"That's not helping.\" Jack glanced at the rear-view screen again. Not only was the monster still following them, it was even closer than before. He was convinced he saw one of its tentacles snap past the ship's window like a charioteer's whip. Another chunk of planet fell and blocked the path ahead. Jack swore and swerved left, then immediately banked right to get around it. His heart pounded so hard his vision started to shake. And then, with a little white flash of hope, he saw them. Stars. The way out. The Adeona must have seen them too, because she rose to a speed faster than anything the accelerator alone would allow. Jack struggled to hold her steady, though by that point he suspected he had barely any control over her at all. He could hear the metal of her hull groaning from the strain. And still those teeth stabbed up and down like knives behind her thrusters. Their starlit exit grew closer and closer. \"Come on, come on,\" he groaned. Jack could hardly keep from shutting his eyes. And then suddenly they were free, launched clear from the cracked planet's gravity by the force of their own momentum. The creature crashed into the continent-sized chunks on the surface and flailed at the escaping ship with its long, squid-like tentacles. It gave up and slid back inside, but not before Jack caught sight of a leathery hide the size of a cruise ship. 11-P-53 picked itself up off the floor for the second time. \"Never offer to do anything for us ever again, you hear me?\" \"Believe me, I won't.\" Jack's stomach heaved but he kept his kwagua berry down. \"From now on—\" He looked out of the window and – despite his nausea – broke into a smile. \"It's a clear path,\" he said, waving Rogan and Tuner over. His heart fluttered. \"Look, everyone. There are no planets or stations in the way. We're through!\" The automata rushed over to the windows on the left side of the cockpit. The golden, flickering Ceros Gate stretched out ad infinitum behind them. The Negoti Corporation's central space station lay only a few thousand clicks away, rotating slowly on its artificial axis, half obscured by Ceros-VI. Ships were passing through its security checkpoint and skipping off into subspace. Each disappeared with the twinkle of a shooting star. \"Move!\" 11-P-53 ushered Jack out of the captain's chair and took his place. \"We need to leave this system before they pick up our signal again.\" \"Not bad, eh?\" said Jack, elbowing Rogan where her ribs would have been. \"For a fleshy,\" she replied with a smirk. \"Okay…\" 11-P-53 pressed a complicated series of buttons to get the skip drive ready. \"The route to Detri's orbit is set. Making the jump in three… two…\" But 11-P-53 never made it to one. The view outside the window went from a beautiful brushstroke of red and purple stardust to a gunmetal grey wall as a scorched and battle-scarred starship punched its way into the Ceros star system. Jack staggered backwards. Besides the Arks, he'd never seen a ship of such magnitude. He'd certainly never stood so close to one before. There seemed to be no end to its sheer, featureless hull. \"I guess we weren't as well hidden from the Negoti Corporation as we thought,\" he said, unable to tear his eyes away. Rogan shook her head and pulled Tuner close. \"That's not Negoti,\" she said in a quiet voice. \"That's Charon.\"",

      "content": "17 Journey Through the Cracked Planet The thick, sweeping floodlights of the Adeona cut through the dark and dusty chasm like a broadsword. Large boulders floated in their gaze. Stray rocks and pebbles clattered harmlessly across the ship's hull. So far, so good. Jack hadn't crashed into any of the canyon walls yet, nor any of the rock faces levitating above and below. But controlling the Adeona in such a tight environment was proving harder than he'd anticipated. With her main rear thrusters offline – partly to conserve fuel, partly to save from ploughing into the first corner he came across – the only way he could turn was to fire short bursts from the air thrusters that ran down her flanks. It was nervous, twitchy work. Slow, too. But slow meant safe, and when every narrow corridor felt like a set of hungry cosmic jaws waiting to chow down on them, everybody on board felt that safe sounded pretty damn good. A gargantuan mass of asphalt-grey rock rose sharply overhead. Jack rammed the joystick forward and threw the Adeona into a steep dive. They levelled out just as the skyscraper-sized rock crashed into the cliffs behind them. The thin atmosphere had leaked down from the surface – though they couldn’t hear the impact, they all felt its vibrations. \"I think we've drifted towards the asthenosphere,\" said Rogan. She studied the unusual material with awe. \"Look at the way the molten rock has cooled and hardened having lost the heat from the planet's core. Don't worry,\" she added, \"we're still nowhere near the gravity well. Stick to heading starboard, if you can.\" Jack suppressed a shiver and continued onwards. He was flying through the bowels of a planet that seemed intent on killing him, and his hands were starting to cramp up. Rogan's geology lessons could wait. His interest regarding the landscape changed after a further thirty minutes of flying through stark, monotonous canyons and – depending on the orientation of the ship – narrow slits that letterboxed his vision. When he caught sight of a bright blue glow in the distance, he turned the Adeona towards it without thinking. \"What is that?\" he asked aloud. Brackitt looked up from his dashboard and shrugged. Tuner climbed up from his cubby hole and Rogan adjusted the magnification of her eye lenses. \"I have no idea,\" she replied, her expression blank. Jack was taken aback. Up until then, he'd assumed Rogan knew everything. \"Take us closer if you can, but be careful.\" As the Adeona glided between tight walls of rock, the blue glow grew ever brighter, then divided into two, then the two into four, and so on. At first Jack wondered if they might be some sort of radiant life form – like flying, glow-in-the-dark jellyfish or something. It already felt as if he were piloting the Adeona through the deep blackness of the ocean abyss as it was. But then the lights revealed themselves to be just that – industrial lights, embedded in the side of a massive rock chunk. Small, unmanned ships were boring into it with razor-sharp drills. The rock chunk split. More of the drilling ships swept in, breaking it down further still and syphoning all the precious material through the channels in their drill heads. \"So that's how they do it,\" said Rogan, nodding. \"Interesting. I've never witnessed planetary mining before.\" \"Are they automata?\" asked Jack. \"They're automated, not automata,\" she replied. \"No sentience, no genuine thought. They don't even know they exist. Still, give them a wide berth. We don't know how they communicate with the central station, or what they might tell them.\" \"Will do,\" said Jack, listing the ship to the left. \"Hold on,\" said Brackitt. His voice sounded frantic. He tapped a button and threw a new holographic display across the front windows. \"Does anybody know what that is?\" The green, 3D-matrix image clearly resembled the Adeona as she was at that moment, floating in an ever-shifting labyrinth of rock. Jack guessed the ship was picking herself up on her own short-range scanners. Ahead and to the right of them were the drilling machines. To the left, another empty chasm. Behind them, something was coming in fast. \"A missile,\" said Rogan, her eyes growing wide. She shook Jack by the shoulders. \"Fly, Jack. Fly!\" \"Whose bright idea was it to fly through a bloody planet anyway?\" muttered Jack, throwing the left lever as far forward as it would go. The Adeona rocketed down the chasm to the left, her thrusters suddenly at full power. The rocky corridor was tight – barely twice the width of the ship – and Jack struggled to keep her from bashing off the walls. He suspected the Adeona was helping to stabilise herself as best she could. \"Is it still behind us?\" he yelled over his shoulder. Rogan had moved the scanner hologram over to the table so that it wouldn't impede Jack's view. \"Closer than ever,\" she shouted back. \"Try to lose it.\" \"Try to lose it?\" Jack laughed desperately. \"How? I'm flying in a straight line!\" Rogan spun the map around. \"Go up,\" she said. \"Up?\" \"Now!\" Jack wrenched the joystick towards himself, sending the Adeona groaning upwards. Thanks to the artificial gravity inside the ship, the pressure wasn't half as bad as it would have been in a fighter jet. Only one automata fell over behind its console. The view went from one narrow crack to another. Jack could have sworn that somewhere, far in the distance, he saw a tiny sliver of starlight… but a second later it was gone, blocked out by another roaming slab of planet. Perhaps they were close to the other side. Or perhaps it had only been the light from the Adeona's floodlights, reflecting off a cluster of Somnium crystals. Either way, he was headed in that direction. \"Did that work?\" he shouted. \"No,\" sighed Rogan. He hated hearing defeat in her voice. \"It's still on our tail.\" Jack spotted another crack on his right, and used the ship's airbrakes to drift inside it without slowing. The missile, a video feed of which was now being projected onto one of the windows, followed close behind, its fierce blue flame scorching the walls of rock as it passed. \"Goddammit,\" snapped Jack, taking another sharp turn. \"Who fired a rocket at us this time, anyway?\" \"I don't think anyone did,\" replied Rogan, pointing at the video. \"It looks like a proximity mining torpedo.\" \"Maybe it detected our movement near the dig site and labelled us a loose rock that needs destroying,\" said Tuner. \"Nah, I don't buy it.\" Jack turned once more. He scraped the Adeona's hull against an unexpected outcrop and winced as sparks showered across the windows. \"That rocket is designed for keeping intruders out, not clearing debris. Why else would somebody set explosives around a spot where their own machines are working?\" \"I don't know, Jack! Do you want to pull over and ask?\" Jack went to reply with something unquestionably witty, only for his blood to turn so cold that his words froze in his throat. He mouth gaped open instead. The crack they were following petered to a point too small for the Adeona to pass through. The chunks of planet had collided and locked together. They were headed for a dead end, and the walls were closing in. \"Erm, guys?\" he finally screamed. \"Anywhere on that map of yours?\" \"Only back the way we came,\" replied a distraught 11-P-53. \"I was hoping you wouldn't say that. How far behind us is the torpedo now?\" \"Eighty metres and closing,\" said 11-P-53. \"I should never have agreed to this…\" Eighty metres was only a couple of ship lengths. If he stopped now, the rocket would tear through the back of them in less than a second. He still remembered a few tricks for evading homing missiles from his time at the Academy… but they were manoeuvres to be deployed outside in the open air, not inside a collapsing planet. Did he even have the space? He guessed he was about to find out. Jack plunged the joystick forwards and then, just when the Adeona had begun her suicidal dive, yanked it back towards him. At the same time, he triggered almost half of the ship's air thrusters. This had much the same effect as pulling the handbrake in a speeding car – the Adeona performed a clumsy but immediate one-eighty degree turn, a move impossible through her rear thrusters alone. This time not even the artificial gravity could counteract the pressure of such a turn. Jack's vision went grey as the blood rushed out from the vessels around his eyes. Something in his chest cracked. His head swam and he felt an urgent need to vomit. But there wasn't time to worry about that. The Adeona's sudden reversal in trajectory confused the torpedo's tracking software. It rocketed past the ship, missing it by mere metres. Jack rammed the accelerating lever forwards again, and the ship raced back towards the entrance of the chasm. The mine attempted to correct its own course in the increasingly narrow space, but its turning circle was much too wide. It crashed into one of the walls and detonated. The planetary chunks to either side first cracked and then ruptured, flinging giant pieces of rock in every direction. \"Hold on,\" said Jack, as the Adeona was peppered with burnt earth. He made another sharp, albeit less painful turn out of the chasm's mouth just as it collapsed completely. Jack brought the ship to an abrupt halt a few seconds later. Colour returned to his vision. \"Everyone all right back there?\" he asked. Rogan staggered towards his chair. \"Nothing that can't be buffed out, I hope,\" she replied. \"That was some good flying, Jack.\" \"It was excellent flying,\" said 11-P-53, climbing to its feet. \"But he burned through half our remaining fuel doing it. We'll struggle to get out of this planet, let alone all the way to Detri!\" \"Better than being dead,\" said Tuner, shrugging. \"Tuner's right.\" Rogan crossed her arms. \"Besides, we'll be fine so long as we can make the jump to subspace. We still have enough Somnium left for one last skip, and then we can coast the rest of the way once we're in orbit around Detri.\" 11-P-53 threw up its hands. \"Don't blame me if we get stranded out here,\" it said, marching out of the cockpit. \"I told you we should have tried our luck sneaking through the station.\" \"It wouldn't have worked without the security codes and you know it.\" Rogan waved the cantankerous robot out of the room. \"Don't listen to 11-P-53, Jack. It just wishes it was still sitting in the captain's chair, that's all.\" Jack blushed and bowed his head. Stealing 11-P-53's sense of captaincy had never been his intention. The poor automata was welcome to take it back the moment the Adeona left the system. \"Speaking of which,\" said Jack, half talking to himself, \"let's not hang around. I reckon that gap over there's a way out. I can see something glittery behind it. Might be stars.\" Rogan looked where Jack was pointing. Her eye lenses grew wide again. She took a step back from the dashboard. \"That's not a gap,\" she said, shaking her head, \"and those aren't stars.\" \"Oh.\" Jack shrugged and readjusted the belts of his chair. \"Somnium crystals or something, then. It's worth a shot.\" Rogan reached over and grabbed Jack's hand before he could push the accelerator. She tapped a button in front of him. One of the windows magnified itself three-fold. \"Does that still look like a crystal to you?\" she snapped. Jack had to concede that it did not. He was no expert, but he was pretty sure most crystals couldn't blink. Then again, he'd never believed an eye could be silver or the size of a house, either. \"Now we know who the proximity torpedo was for,\" said Rogan, whispering as if it might hear them. \"We need to turn around very, very slowly.\" \"What the hell is that thing?\" said Jack, his hands frozen. Whatever the creature was, it blinked again… and then rolled its silver eye towards them. \"Big,\" said Tuner. \"Big, and hungry.\" 11-P-53 ran back into the cockpit and shook Jack out of his petrified stupor. \"Screw the fuel reserves!\" it yelled. \"Just get us out of here!\" As soon as Jack ignited the ship's thrusters, the colossal beast lunged after them. It bulldozed through the surrounding rocks as if they were lumps of marshmallow. Jack swung the Adeona around and launched it back the way they came. \"Good grief,\" he screamed, glancing at a video feed from the back of the ship. \"That thing's a monster!\" The darkness around them was near-absolute, but what Jack could see terrified him. Tentacles whipped across the rock faces on either side like steel cables, cutting through the stone. Rows of needle-thin teeth gnashed up and down, each as long as a train carriage, glinting like knives in the brief flashes of floodlight. The rest of its body remained hidden in shadow. There was little doubt that the creature was gigantic enough to devour the ship. The question was, could it manage it in one bite or two? \"Come on, guys. Give me some help here!\" Rogan, Tuner and 11-P-53 were back at the hologram table, swiping through maps of the planet. \"I don't know what to suggest,\" Rogan cried out. \"The pieces of the planet are shifting around too much. It's not as if any of the maps actually match!\" The Adeona's floodlights picked up a rock formation arching between two floating chunks. Jack sent the ship gliding under it. The creature went crashing through it less than a second later. \"Just tell me which side of the planet is closest!\" \"Left,\" shouted Tuner. \"Go left!\" Jack's hands were so sweaty they almost slipped right off the joystick. He yanked it to the left, praying for an exit in that approximate direction. He found one, though not one as early as he would have liked. The Adeona clipped the edge of a rock with a painful crunch. \"Is she all right?\" asked Jack. The ship maintained her breakneck pace. \"She's fine,\" said Brackitt. \"A bit bruised, but nothing a mining ship can't shrug off. Down to six percent fuel, by the way.\" \"That's not helping.\" Jack glanced at the rear-view screen again. Not only was the monster still following them, it was even closer than before. He was convinced he saw one of its tentacles snap past the ship's window like a charioteer's whip. Another chunk of planet fell and blocked the path ahead. Jack swore and swerved left, then immediately banked right to get around it. His heart pounded so hard his vision started to shake. And then, with a little white flash of hope, he saw them. Stars.

And then suddenly they were free, launched clear from the cracked planet's gravity by the force of their own momentum. The creature crashed into the continent-sized chunks on the surface and flailed at the escaping ship with its long, squid-like tentacles. It gave up and slid back inside, but not before Jack caught sight of a leathery hide the size of a cruise ship. 11-P-53 picked itself up off the floor for the second time. \"Never offer to do anything for us ever again, you hear me?\" \"Believe me, I won't.\" Jack's stomach heaved but he kept his kwagua berry down. \"From now on—\" He looked out of the window and – despite his nausea – broke into a smile. \"It's a clear path,\" he said, waving Rogan and Tuner over. His heart fluttered. \"Look, everyone. There are no planets or stations in the way. We're through!\" The automata rushed over to the windows on the left side of the cockpit. The golden, flickering Ceros Gate stretched out ad infinitum behind them. The Negoti Corporation's central space station lay only a few thousand clicks away, rotating slowly on its artificial axis, half obscured by Ceros-VI. Ships were passing through its security checkpoint and skipping off into subspace. Each disappeared with the twinkle of a shooting star. \"Move!\" 11-P-53 ushered Jack out of the captain's chair and took his place. \"We need to leave this system before they pick up our signal again.\" \"Not bad, eh?\" said Jack, elbowing Rogan where her ribs would have been. \"For a fleshy,\" she replied with a smirk. \"Okay…\" 11-P-53 pressed a complicated series of buttons to get the skip drive ready. \"The route to Detri's orbit is set.

The view outside the window went from a beautiful brushstroke of red and purple stardust to a gunmetal grey wall as a scorched and battle-scarred starship punched its way into the Ceros star system. Jack staggered backwards. Besides the Arks, he'd never seen a ship of such magnitude. He'd certainly never stood so close to one before. There seemed to be no end to its sheer, featureless hull. \"I guess we weren't as well hidden from the Negoti Corporation as we thought,\" he said, unable to tear his eyes away. Rogan shook her head and pulled Tuner close. \"That's not Negoti,\" she said in a quiet voice. \"That's Charon.\"",

      "title": "Charon’s Ultimatum",
      "content": "18 Charon’s Ultimatum The video message arrived less than a minute later. Nobody said or did much in the meantime. The automata looked defeated, like chess players who know there's no move left for them to play. Many had fled the cockpit to hide in the ship's many nooks and crannies. 11-P-53 remained slumped in the captain's chair, its head bowed low. Rogan kept patting Tuner on the back. \"We're doomed,\" sighed Tuner, \"aren't we?\" Clearly Rogan didn't want to lie, because she didn't answer. Jack crossed to the windows on the other side of the cockpit. A few Negoti patrol ships were coming to join the battlecruiser, though they didn't appear to be in any great hurry. He guessed they'd known of its arrival ahead of schedule. They were probably only there to keep an eye on proceedings. Against the inordinate bulk of the battlecruiser, they looked even more pathetic than the Adeona… like flies buzzing around a wildebeest's behind. \"Why haven't they blown us up yet?\" he asked. \"They're not going to,\" said Rogan. \"Probably. They'll want to capture us and put us back to work. The ship, especially.\" \"Not me,\" said Tuner, fidgeting. \"I stole their plans. They'll root around inside my head and then throw me into a crusher.\" Jack didn't know which made him feel worse – that poor Tuner spoke so resignedly of his punishment, or that nobody in the cockpit tried to correct him. His eyes were drawn back to the expressionless battlecruiser blocking their path. He couldn't help but imagine the alien horrors waiting for him inside. That Gaskan creep needed the automata – at least until he had the blueprints back in his possession. But what would they do when they discovered a random human on board, too? Put him to work on this mysterious superstructure the automata kept banging on about? Toss him out of an airlock without a helmet? Chop him up and turn him into Raklett rations? He opened his mouth to give a rousing speech about the merits of making a run for it, but it was at that moment the message turned up. Scores of video screens exploded across the windows of the Adeona, replicating over one another like the galaxy's most irritating computer virus. From each one glared the same face. Jack recoiled, shuddering as if with a fever. The creature before him was grotesque. The entire surface of its glossy, red head was disfigured with thick and violent scratches. From behind sprouted a pair of large, twisted horns, not unlike a ram's. Then Jack's panic abated, and he saw the truth – the creature hid its true appearance behind a mask. The horns had been soldered onto what must have once been a sleek ruby helmet. Jack suspected the creature was no less hideous underneath, however – the crimson armour it wore over its slim torso was painfully mangled and warped. \"I'm guessing that's Charon,\" whispered Jack, inching away from the dashboard. \"He can't see us, can he?\" Rogan shook her head. \"It's a recording. I don't even think he's in the same system as us.\" The ship's comm speakers crackled into life. \"To all those aboard the Adeona,\" said Charon, \"heed my warning well. This will be your only one.\" The mask amplified the warlord's voice. His words were perfectly clear. Calculated menace dripped off every sharp syllable. Yet the voice surprised Jack. It carried not the rage and arrogance of youth that he expected, but rather the laboured tones of an older, perhaps even wiser man. \"Your crew is the sole property of the Iris project,\" said Charon, tilting his head to the side. \"You are mine. You belong to me. You are fugitives in a stolen ship, also mine. I would be completely in my right to have my battleship torch you all to ash.\" \"Get everyone to the airlock,\" 11-P-53 said to Brackitt. \"Be ready to jump out if they open fire on us.\" \"What about me?\" hissed Jack, as Brackitt ran from the cockpit. \"I'm not an automata. I can't survive in a vacuum, remember?\" \"Then it sounds like you're screwed either way.\" 11-P-53 shrugged. \"Don't worry. If they launch their rockets, we all are.\" \"Yet for the sake of brevity, I am willing to make a deal,\" Charon continued. \"None of you are of any consequence. You are all expendable, your positions on the project already filled. But one of you stole something important from me. I cannot let that pass. Hand the offending automata over to my associate, and the rest of you shall be free to leave unharmed.\" Charon leaned towards the camera so that his mask filled most of the frame. \"You have three minutes to comply.\" Every video screen around the Adeona shut down at once. Nobody said anything. Everyone turned to look at Tuner. \"Please don't,\" he said, cowering. \"Of course we won't hand you over,\" said Rogan, giving him a sorry look. \"We're in this together. Besides, he's lying. The second they have you on board that battlecruiser, he'll send the order to obliterate us.\" \"And they'll obliterate us if we don't,\" said 11-P-53, pacing back and forth. He paused. \"Not that I'm saying we should send IL-6-88 over to them, of course. But if there's even the tiniest chance…\" \"There isn't,\" snapped Rogan. \"He's not going.\" 11-P-53 raised its hands in surrender and continued pacing up and down the cockpit. \"He's bluffing,\" said Jack, waggling a finger at the battlecruiser in front of them. \"They won't blow us up if we refuse to give them Tuner. If anything, they're more likely to blow us up if we do.\" \"Oh yeah?\" said 11-P-53. \"And how did you arrive at that genius conclusion?\" \"We don't have time for this,\" said Tuner, tugging at Rogan's hand. \"Let Jack speak,\" she said. \"If destroying both us and the blueprints in Tuner's head was an option, don't you think Charon would have done it by now? Tuner, be honest. Did you make a copy of their plans, or did you just move the original file from their server onto your hard drive?\" Tuner bowed his head. \"I copied it and erased the original,\" he mumbled. \"I thought maybe we could use it for leverage.\" Rogan gasped. 11-P-53 grunted in frustration. \"No wonder Gaskan came after us, you bolt-brain,\" Rogan snapped. \"You're carrying the only copy of the blueprints they have!\" \"Exactly!\" Jack couldn't help but break into a desperate grin. \"If they just wanted to make sure you guys couldn't sell the plans, we'd be dead already. The fact that Tuner stole the originals is the only reason we're still alive!\" \"It's the only reason we're in this mess, too.\" 11-P-53 shook its head. \"How could you be so stupid?\" \"Sorry,\" said Tuner. \"It's all right.\" Rogan flashed 11-P-53 another stern look. \"So what should we do? Wait out the three minutes and see what happens?\" \"It's just the one minute now…\" mumbled Tuner, fidgeting. \"No.\" Jack crossed his arms. \"We don't wait for them to make their move. We make one of our own.\" \"You think we should try to run?\" she asked. \"Why not? Anyone got a better idea?\" The automata all looked at one another. \"If we can get around the battlecruiser, the Adeona could jump to subspace,\" said 11-P-53. It sounded as if it were coming around to the idea, but then it sighed. \"But they followed us here, somehow. Who's to say they won't follow us someplace else?\" \"Then we'll be in no worse a situation than we are now,\" said Rogan. \"Apart from having no fuel left in our engine or skip drive, that is.\" \"At least it'll wind Charon up,\" said Tuner. Everyone looked at 11-P-53. \"Fine,\" it said, marching over to the captain's chair. \"But I'm flying, got it?\" \"She's all yours,\" said Jack, standing back. \"We have ten seconds left.\" Tuner was practically jumping up and down with anxiety. \"You might want—\" 11-P-53 didn't wait for anyone to be ready. Jack supposed it thought that if nobody on board the Adeona knew what to expect, then neither would anyone on board the battlecruiser. It wasn't the worst logic ever. The ship accelerated and dived with the full force of her thrusters. And then everything… stopped. The fabric of the universe appeared to ripple for the slightest of moments, and then everything turned silent. The Adeona's engines switched off. The lights and screens across the bridge went dark. Jack felt his body lift up off the floor. \"Erm… what's happening, guys?\" Nobody answered. Up front, 11-P-53 sat limp in its chair. Jack glanced over at Rogan and Tuner. They were floating as well. That much didn't scare him – he was in space, after all – but the sight of their lifeless eyes was more than his shattered nerves could bear. The power hadn't just gone out across the ship – it had gone out of his friends, too. He tried to grab hold of a nearby seat, but missed. The battlecruiser must have fired an EMP – an electro-magnetic pulse. Everything even vaguely electronic had gone dark, including the artificial gravity. His heart hammered faster and faster. If that had gone, how long would it be before the life support systems shut down as well? How long would it take for the ship to run out of air? From somewhere deep inside the ship came a faint hissing noise. Either the Adeona had burst a pipe or somebody was trying to get inside. Jack twisted himself around in mid-air and used the back of 11-P-53's seat as a springboard, catapulting himself down the length of the cockpit. He clipped the corner of the hologram table as he passed, and had to grab hold of it to keep from crashing into one of the computer monitors. Zero-gravity flight wasn't half as intuitive as it looked. If Gaskan's troops were boarding the Adeona, he needed a place to hide. He wasn't any good at fighting at the best of times, let alone when he couldn't keep his feet on the floor. And hell – if the Rakletts weren't looking for a human, maybe there was a chance they wouldn't find one. He looked back at Rogan and Tuner. It was over. There was nothing he could do for them now. He lunged at the doorway, grabbing the frame with both hands. His torso slammed into the bottom of the wall beside it, making his eyes water. The whole corridor appeared to be lying on its side. Jack shook his head and tried to pull himself the right way up. The door to his quarters was at the far end, past another pair of deactivated automata. If he could make it there, maybe he could stash himself beneath the bunk in his room, or in one of the storage chests. But he never got the chance. Before he could throw himself down the corridor, a pair of gnarly metal boots stepped out in front of him. Jack raised his head and the butt of a rifle came down to meet it. Everything went black.",

      "content": "18 Charon’s Ultimatum The video message arrived less than a minute later. Nobody said or did much in the meantime. The automata looked defeated, like chess players who know there's no move left for them to play. Many had fled the cockpit to hide in the ship's many nooks and crannies. 11-P-53 remained slumped in the captain's chair, its head bowed low. Rogan kept patting Tuner on the back. \"We're doomed,\" sighed Tuner, \"aren't we?\" Clearly Rogan didn't want to lie, because she didn't answer. Jack crossed to the windows on the other side of the cockpit. A few Negoti patrol ships were coming to join the battlecruiser, though they didn't appear to be in any great hurry. He guessed they'd known of its arrival ahead of schedule. They were probably only there to keep an eye on proceedings. Against the inordinate bulk of the battlecruiser, they looked even more pathetic than the Adeona… like flies buzzing around a wildebeest's behind. \"Why haven't they blown us up yet?\" he asked. \"They're not going to,\" said Rogan. \"Probably. They'll want to capture us and put us back to work. The ship, especially.\" \"Not me,\" said Tuner, fidgeting. \"I stole their plans. They'll root around inside my head and then throw me into a crusher.\" Jack didn't know which made him feel worse – that poor Tuner spoke so resignedly of his punishment, or that nobody in the cockpit tried to correct him. His eyes were drawn back to the expressionless battlecruiser blocking their path. He couldn't help but imagine the alien horrors waiting for him inside. That Gaskan creep needed the automata – at least until he had the blueprints back in his possession. But what would they do when they discovered a random human on board, too? Put him to work on this mysterious superstructure the automata kept banging on about? Toss him out of an airlock without a helmet? Chop him up and turn him into Raklett rations? He opened his mouth to give a rousing speech about the merits of making a run for it, but it was at that moment the message turned up. Scores of video screens exploded across the windows of the Adeona, replicating over one another like the galaxy's most irritating computer virus. From each one glared the same face. Jack recoiled, shuddering as if with a fever. The creature before him was grotesque. The entire surface of its glossy, red head was disfigured with thick and violent scratches. From behind sprouted a pair of large, twisted horns, not unlike a ram's. Then Jack's panic abated, and he saw the truth – the creature hid its true appearance behind a mask. The horns had been soldered onto what must have once been a sleek ruby helmet. Jack suspected the creature was no less hideous underneath, however – the crimson armour it wore over its slim torso was painfully mangled and warped. \"I'm guessing that's Charon,\" whispered Jack, inching away from the dashboard. \"He can't see us, can he?\" Rogan shook her head. \"It's a recording. I don't even think he's in the same system as us.\" The ship's comm speakers crackled into life. \"To all those aboard the Adeona,\" said Charon, \"heed my warning well. This will be your only one.\" The mask amplified the warlord's voice. His words were perfectly clear. Calculated menace dripped off every sharp syllable. Yet the voice surprised Jack. It carried not the rage and arrogance of youth that he expected, but rather the laboured tones of an older, perhaps even wiser man. \"Your crew is the sole property of the Iris project,\" said Charon, tilting his head to the side. \"You are mine. You belong to me. You are fugitives in a stolen ship, also mine. I would be completely in my right to have my battleship torch you all to ash.\" \"Get everyone to the airlock,\" 11-P-53 said to Brackitt. \"Be ready to jump out if they open fire on us.\" \"What about me?\" hissed Jack, as Brackitt ran from the cockpit. \"I'm not an automata. I can't survive in a vacuum, remember?\" \"Then it sounds like you're screwed either way.\" 11-P-53 shrugged. \"Don't worry. If they launch their rockets, we all are.\" \"Yet for the sake of brevity, I am willing to make a deal,\" Charon continued. \"None of you are of any consequence. You are all expendable, your positions on the project already filled. But one of you stole something important from me. I cannot let that pass. Hand the offending automata over to my associate, and the rest of you shall be free to leave unharmed.\" Charon leaned towards the camera so that his mask filled most of the frame. \"You have three minutes to comply.\" Every video screen around the Adeona shut down at once. Nobody said anything. Everyone turned to look at Tuner. \"Please don't,\" he said, cowering. \"Of course we won't hand you over,\" said Rogan, giving him a sorry look. \"We're in this together. Besides, he's lying. The second they have you on board that battlecruiser, he'll send the order to obliterate us.\" \"And they'll obliterate us if we don't,\" said 11-P-53, pacing back and forth. He paused. \"Not that I'm saying we should send IL-6-88 over to them, of course. But if there's even the tiniest chance…\" \"There isn't,\" snapped Rogan. \"He's not going.\" 11-P-53 raised its hands in surrender and continued pacing up and down the cockpit. \"He's bluffing,\" said Jack, waggling a finger at the battlecruiser in front of them. \"They won't blow us up if we refuse to give them Tuner. If anything, they're more likely to blow us up if we do.\" \"Oh yeah?\" said 11-P-53. \"And how did you arrive at that genius conclusion?\" \"We don't have time for this,\" said Tuner, tugging at Rogan's hand. \"Let Jack speak,\" she said. \"If destroying both us and the blueprints in Tuner's head was an option, don't you think Charon would have done it by now? Tuner, be honest. Did you make a copy of their plans, or did you just move the original file from their server onto your hard drive?\" Tuner bowed his head. \"I copied it and erased the original,\" he mumbled. \"I thought maybe we could use it for leverage.\" Rogan gasped. 11-P-53 grunted in frustration. \"No wonder Gaskan came after us, you bolt-brain,\" Rogan snapped. \"You're carrying the only copy of the blueprints they have!\" \"Exactly!\" Jack couldn't help but break into a desperate grin. \"If they just wanted to make sure you guys couldn't sell the plans, we'd be dead already. The fact that Tuner stole the originals is the only reason we're still alive!\" \"It's the only reason we're in this mess, too.\" 11-P-53 shook its head. \"How could you be so stupid?\" \"Sorry,\" said Tuner. \"It's all right.\" Rogan flashed 11-P-53 another stern look. \"So what should we do? Wait out the three minutes and see what happens?\" \"It's just the one minute now…\" mumbled Tuner, fidgeting. \"No.\" Jack crossed his arms. \"We don't wait for them to make their move. We make one of our own.\" \"You think we should try to run?\" she asked. \"Why not? Anyone got a better idea?\" The automata all looked at one another. \"If we can get around the battlecruiser, the Adeona could jump to subspace,\" said 11-P-53. It sounded as if it were coming around to the idea, but then it sighed. \"But they followed us here, somehow. Who's to say they won't follow us someplace else?\" \"Then we'll be in no worse a situation than we are now,\" said Rogan. \"Apart from having no fuel left in our engine or skip drive, that is.\" \"At least it'll wind Charon up,\" said Tuner. Everyone looked at 11-P-53. \"Fine,\" it said, marching over to the captain's chair. \"But I'm flying, got it?\" \"She's all yours,\" said Jack, standing back. \"We have ten seconds left.\" Tuner was practically jumping up and down with anxiety. \"You might want—\" 11-P-53 didn't wait for anyone to be ready. Jack supposed it thought that if nobody on board the Adeona knew what to expect, then neither would anyone on board the battlecruiser. It wasn't the worst logic ever. The ship accelerated and dived with the full force of her thrusters. And then everything… stopped. The fabric of the universe appeared to ripple for the slightest of moments, and then everything turned silent. The Adeona's engines switched off. The lights and screens across the bridge went dark. Jack felt his body lift up off the floor. \"Erm… what's happening, guys?\" Nobody answered. Up front, 11-P-53 sat limp in its chair. Jack glanced over at Rogan and Tuner. They were floating as well. That much didn't scare him – he was in space, after all – but the sight of their lifeless eyes was more than his shattered nerves could bear. The power hadn't just gone out across the ship – it had gone out of his friends, too. He tried to grab hold of a nearby seat, but missed. The battlecruiser must have fired an EMP – an electro-magnetic pulse. Everything even vaguely electronic had gone dark, including the artificial gravity. His heart hammered faster and faster.

      "content": "19 The Confession He could smell the fabric softener Amber used on their bedsheets, sense the heat of the morning sun on his face as it spilled through the blinds on the windows. He could hear the clatter of his wife eating breakfast in the kitchen. Jack winced. A dull ache in his temples and a soft gurgling in his stomach dragged him back into consciousness. He was nursing one hell of a hangover. Even his chest hurt, for some reason. He mumbled for Amber to bring him a glass of water and a couple of ibuprofen. The dry voice that replied was most definitely not hers. \"I don't know what this Amber of yours is,\" it said, \"but I highly doubt it's in any position to help you now.\" Jack opened his eyes with a start. Gone in an instant were the sounds and smells of his Sandhurst apartment. In their place were the four stark and silent walls of what looked like an operating theatre, albeit one run by a surgeon with an appalling standard of hygiene. Splatters of black mould and blood painted the white tiles. Snaggletoothed cutting tools hung from rails running along the ceiling. Something dead lay curled in the foetal position on a metal trolley pushed up against the far wall. A stabbing pain made him reach for his head, only to discover his arms were pinned against his sides. Jack lowered his chin to his chest. He was strapped to some sort of upright gurney, his arms and legs locked into place by shiny mechanical clamps. Trying to wriggle free only made the clamps lock tighter. \"Such an unusual specimen,\" said the same voice as before. It was brittle like sand yet sharp like broken glass, and it made the hairs on the back of Jack's neck stand to attention. \"And how curious that it would choose to align itself with such defective junk.\" Gaskan Troi walked around to the front of Jack's gurney. Seeing him up close did Jack's troubled stomach no favours. Gaskan's translucent skin wrapped around his skull like cellophane. His eyes were dark, exaggerating their already hollow appearance. His robe was identical to the one he wore at the market – long, burgundy and immaculate. He steepled his withered fingers as he studied Jack. A hovering, barrel-shaped automata floated around from the other side. An assortment of cutting, stitching and cauterising instruments extended and retracted from within its rotund chest cavity. A medical unit once, perhaps – though Jack suspected Gaskan had retrofitted it for other means. Right now it was performing a thorough scan of him and taking notes. Gaskan stepped closer so that his face was only inches from Jack's own. Jack grimaced and turned his head to the side. Every muscle in his trapped body grew tense. \"You were with them at the market,\" Gaskan said, his mouth sneering downwards, \"and now I find you on their ship. Why? What did they promise you?\" \"Promise me?\" Jack tried hard not to breathe – Gaskan had a stale odour like old mushrooms. \"Nothing! They found me floating out in space and picked me up, that's all. I stuck with them because I had nowhere else to go.\" Gaskan's sneer turned up at the edges. \"Drifter trash.\" He shook his head. \"Pathetic.\" \"Where am I?\" asked Jack, once Gaskan had pulled away. \"What did you do with the others?\" \"You're on board my ship, the Confession. As for your friends… they will be undergoing repatriation momentarily. Their drives will be wiped and their shells put to better use. I'm sure we can find something far more inventive to do with you.\" Jack tried breaking out of his restraints with no greater success than before. Gaskan laughed. The medical robot finished its scan and made a hasty retreat to a spot beside the room's only door. \"What became of the Luethian I sent after you?\" Gaskan asked, continuing his interrogation. \"It was his tracking beacon that led me here, so you can imagine my surprise to find no bounty hunter waiting for payment. That's very unlike them.\" Jack didn't know what in the galaxy a Luethian was, but he had to assume the four-armed hitman who'd blown out their skip drive had been a card-carrying member of their tribe. \"What does it matter?\" Gaskan's face turned dark and fierce. He snapped his fingers and his automata shot forwards. From inside its chest extended a buzzsaw, which whirled and whistled about an inch from Jack's forehead. \"Speak, or I'll cut something off.\" \"I shot him!\" said Jack, scrunching his eyes shut. \"He's dead!\" Gaskan's face contorted into an incredulous sneer. Then he burst out laughing. It sounded like frozen twigs being snapped. The rusty medical unit calmly retracted its saw and hovered back to its post by the door. \"You did, didn't you? My oh my – not so pathetic after all.\" He extended one long, bony, quadruple-jointed finger and tapped the piece of scrap metal patching up the hole in Jack's spacesuit. \"Though not before he got a shot off at you, I see. Fascinating, quite fascinating. I should be thanking you. You've saved me quite a lot of money.\" \"You're welcome. Now how about setting me free?\" Again, Gaskan laughed. \"I think not.\" He turned around and approached the door. \"Besides, you're a drifter – where would you even go?\" Jack opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again. The creep had a point. Gaskan paused. He turned back around, studying Jack as if he were some curious riddle Gaskan was forever on the verge of solving. \"Such an unusual specimen,\" he said again. \"What did you say your home world was?\" Jack sighed. The last thing he wanted was to put his planet in the sights of somebody like Gaskan, but the possibility of a buzzsaw slicing through his face seemed a far more pressing concern. \"Earth,\" he said. For somebody with the outward appearance of an unearthed corpse, Gaskan could move surprisingly fast. He marched back across the room and wrapped a spindly hand around Jack's throat. \"Do not lie to me,\" Gaskan spat. His sunken eyes were wide, his grip so strong Jack could hardly breathe. \"I'm not lying,\" said Jack, each word a wheeze. \"I'm a human. We don't come from anywhere else.\" Jack was sure that Gaskan was going to crush his throat like an aluminium can. Perhaps that was his original intention. But then a second later the skeletal alien's grip relaxed and he pulled away, lost in his own thoughts. That was when Jack realised Gaskan's eyes weren't wide with rage, but true disbelief. \"You've heard of Earth before, haven't you?\" Hope rose in Jack's heart like a sudden and violent tide, drowning out the throbbing ache in his bruised neck. \"Tell me you know how to get there. Tell me!\" Gaskan didn't listen. Slowly, his fingers returned to their steeple shape. His mind was elsewhere, racing along its scheming tracks at a thousand clicks a second. Jack shook himself against the locks on his arms and legs, his hands clenching and unclenching, his eyes blurring with tears. \"For Christ's sake, tell me where it is! Please!\" Gaskan nodded to himself as if arriving at a conclusion. He turned back to Jack. A crooked smile spread across his narrow, milky-white lips. \"Oh, Charon shall be pleased,\" he said. \"Retrieving the stolen Iris blueprints was one thing, but this… this could hasten the project greatly. A discovery of such magnitude may even warrant a visit from Charon himself.\" Jack swallowed hard. Perhaps Charon had a penchant for collecting rare and exotic species, or something. Maybe his destiny was to end up inside a glass display case, stuffed like a taxidermy tiger. \"You don't have to do this,\" said Jack, coughing. The throttling and screaming had filled his mouth with the taste of copper. \"Oh, but I do,\" replied Gaskan, grinning further. \"You see, I serve Charon for only as long as my master wills it. The sooner Charon's pet project is complete, the sooner I am free… free to follow plans of a somewhat\"—he waved his hand dismissively—\"grander nature.\" He reached out and tapped Jack's chest plate. \"You, human, are my ticket out of here.\" Gaskan strode to the door – it opened with a hiss. He turned to the automata waiting beside it. \"Upload the scans and the recovered blueprints to my monitor upstairs. I wish to inform Charon of our success myself.\" The automata bleeped in the affirmative and floated out through the open doorway. Before locking the door, Gaskan turned to watch Jack struggle ineptly against his restraints. \"I do hope you're not the best humanity has to offer,\" he said, shaking his head and laughing, \"otherwise you are a very sorry species indeed.\" The door hissed shut, and Jack was left to scream for help alone.",

      "content": "20 Is it Safe? Nobody came, obviously. The macabre medical room could have been soundproofed for all Jack knew, and even if it wasn't – who did he expect to come running to his rescue? The nearest human was most likely half a universe away, the crew of the Adeona were all deactivated, dismantled or reprogrammed to serve without question, and he suspected everybody else aboard the Confession would just as quickly eat him as set him free. Five minutes came and went. Once his voice grew too hoarse to scream anymore he went back to wriggling around on his makeshift torture-gurney. When that achieved nothing beyond making his arms sore, he started looking around the room for a different means of escape. And soon realised there wasn't one. He sighed. Some intergalactic explorer he was turning out to be. Gaskan was right – if Jack Bishop was the best humanity had to offer, the species deserved to go extinct. But he wasn't the best. Probably not even in the top half. He was a mediocre engineer, a flunk of a pilot, and a husband to a brilliant, beautiful woman who surely spent each and every night questioning what she had done to deserve someone so utterly disappointing. She might have got a ticket on one of the Arks if she hadn't married him. Maybe she would have gone on to meet a doctor, or an astrophysicist, or an actual bloody pilot – a profession humanity needed. Somebody she needed. Because if it weren't for his failure to make something of himself, she wouldn't be as good as dead. He shook his head. No. He couldn't think like that. There was always a chance she'd be allocated tickets through the lottery. And if – no, when – he found his way back to Earth, they'd be given a pair of first class seats for sure. He'd be hailed a hero. Especially if he returned with a working skip drive – he reckoned even that Reeves fellow would line up to shake his hand if he did that. All he had to do was get back to Earth. To her. And then everything would be all right. He looked over at the dead alien on the metal trolley. It wasn't clear how the creature had died, though Jack suspected it hadn't been from natural causes. There was no blood, nor wounds, nor bruises of any kind. The whole of its shrivelled, hairless body appeared untouched – though of course, Jack had no clue what the poor creature had looked like to begin with. Could he look forward to the same fate when Charon arrived? Was this what he did to his most prized specimens? And why did Gaskan seem so sure that Charon would care about one little human from Earth, for that matter? It was hardly the most impressive planet, even to humans. Why didn't Gaskan just kill him and be done with it? His heart sank. Maybe Earth lay too far out for anyone in the intergalactic community to reach with current skip drive technology. Maybe wormholes were the answer. That would explain why almost nobody had heard of Earth before, and why the human race had never been visited by aliens in the past. Ah well. There was little point in speculating. Besides – if he didn't break free, he could always ask Charon himself. Another bout of jerking back and forth achieved nothing except turn his stomach and send his head into a daze. The scar across his chest was starting to hurt again, too. The effects of that magical fruit must have worn off. He didn't suppose he'd have much luck putting in a request for more at the Confession's galley. He looked over at his left shoulder. The arms of his spacesuit could be removed with a relatively simple click-and-twist motion. It would be pretty easy to slip his arm out, if he could unlock one of them. The problem was that the arms were vacuumed sealed for the exact opposite purpose. The last thing anyone wanted when traversing the dusty plains of Mars was part of their spacesuit coming loose. No amount of deranged wriggling would pry them free. He was looking around for another means of escape – to see if the whole gurney-rack could be toppled over, perhaps – when the door to the room opened with another serpentine hiss. Jack stood up straight, which given his situation didn't prove much of a challenge. Adrenaline surged through his veins and the skin on the back of his neck grew tight. It wasn't Gaskan. It was the medical automata. Honestly, Jack didn't know which was worse. It hovered towards him in complete silence. There was no rumble to its motors, and it didn't say a word. It just… floated. Jack felt his blood turn cold. Every inch of his body screamed at him to run. But all he could do was watch, without daring to even blink, as the automata descended upon him the way a mad surgeon might lean over his paralysed patient. From inside its barrel-shaped body extended a long, sharp drill. \"Oh Jesus, no…\" Jack’s eyes grew wide. He shuddered against his restraints. \"Please don't do this. Please don't… The drill began to spin, emitting a high-pitched whine that made his eyes water and set his teeth on edge. \"Stop. Stop! I'll do whatever you want. For Christ's sake, what do you want? Tell Gaskan—\" The automata darted forwards… and rammed the whirring drill bit into a hole in the side of the clamp around his left arm. It retracted its drill a moment later, and the two halves of the clamp popped open. \"What the hell?\" Jack flexed his arm to get the blood pumping again. It had started to go numb. The automata floated over to Jack's other arm and did the same, then started on the clamps on his legs. With a swelling heart Jack realised the robot wasn't using a drill, but a screwdriver. It was setting him free. \"What's happening?\" he asked, as the automata unlocked the last of his restraints. \"Why are you doing this?\" The medical automata folded its mechanical arm back inside its body. \"The automata Gaskan brought on board,\" it said. \"You were with them, yes?\" \"Yes, I suppose I was,\" said Jack, steadying himself against the gurney. \"Is it really true they stole the blueprints to Charon's project? And that they’re headed to the sanctuary on Detri?\" Jack eyed the robot carefully, cautious about where its line of questioning might be headed. \"That's what I'm told, yes.\" The automata beeped excitedly and leaned in close. \"Vive la résistance!\" it whispered, before hurrying back out the door. Jack stood in stunned silence. Vive la résistance. Seriously? That was the best his translator chip could come up with? \"Hey, wait!\" he said, hobbling to the doorway. \"Why did you free me? And which way do I go to find the ships?\" But the robot was already gone, the corridor outside empty. He sighed. Never mind. He was free, which was a start. Now all he had to do was figure out a way off an alien battlecruiser. How hard could that be?",

      "title": "The Crossroads",
      "content": "21 The Crossroads The corridors, wide and for the most part featureless, seemed to stretch on forever. The panels of light running along the ceiling weren't half as bright as those of the medical room. The angular walls and floors were built from a strange, grey plastic-metal alloy stained with oil and covered in unswept dirt. It gave the battlecruiser's artificial air a peculiar though not wholly unpleasant smell – a cocktail of the natural and mechanical, of an old submarine crossed with a burrow. Jack started off by tiptoeing down the corridors, keeping his back close to the wall in case he ran into any patrolling guards. There had been nobody stationed outside the door of the medical room, and he hadn't seen anybody since. He increased his pace to a light jog, grateful that his footsteps didn't ring out against the floor the way they would have on board the Adeona. He was surprised by the lack of security aboard the Confession, but he supposed it made sense. To effectively patrol a ship that size would require a small army. Why waste the manpower when everyone you brought on board would be either disassembled or strapped to a gurney? Gaskan hadn't expected anyone in his crew to unlock the door and free Jack from his restraints. Perhaps his mistake was not considering his medical automata part of the crew. Speaking of which, he needed to keep an eye out for drones. Jack hadn't spotted any security cameras so far – none visible to the human eye, at least – but that didn't mean there weren't less \"liberated\" automata who wouldn't hesitate to sound the alarm if they saw him. He came to a crossroads between corridors. A small pile of industrial metal crates had been stacked up in the corner. He crouched behind them and peered between the gaps. Finally, a sign of life. Two Rakletts stood outside an open doorway, talking. They were too far away for Jack's translator chip to kick in, and so all he heard was a series of snarls and grunts. They seemed irritated about something, but with Rakletts it was hard to tell. They could have just as easily been telling jokes. It was the first chance Jack had to study them since the incident in the market on Kapamentis, and that had been mostly a blur. They looked no less unpleasant under calmer circumstances. Their hair was matted and greasy like that of a stray dog, their hands and ears war-torn and scarred. Their armour was cobbled together from second-hand scrap, from their loose chest plates to their weathered leather boots. Through each of their stumpy muzzles was pierced a single gold ring. It wasn't that Jack was relieved to run into them, exactly – their presence severely decreased his chance of survival, let alone escape. But it did dash his growing suspicion that he was alone in a prison adrift through space. Plus, if there were guards stationed, he had to be getting close to something. With any luck it would be a dock with a spaceship he could steal. Presuming he could get one up and running, of course… but he would cross that bridge when he came to it. One of the Rakletts said something abrupt to the other, and then they both started marching down the corridor towards Jack's hiding spot. Jack ducked down. There was nowhere else to hide. Nowhere better, at any rate. He'd passed a small loading vehicle a good thirty seconds or so back down the corridor, but there was no way he could make it there without the Rakletts seeing him. He wrapped his arms around his knees and made himself as small as possible. The Rakletts stopped at the crossroads, sniffed, then continued their march down the corridor from which Jack came. Neither so much as glanced in his direction. Jack let out out a sigh of relief, then caught a strong whiff of their sharp, pungent odour as he went to inhale again. They stank of sweat and raw meat. He wondered if they were headed that way on account of his escape. Did anyone even know yet? Wouldn't somebody have sounded the alarm if they did? He supposed it didn't matter too much in the long run… so long as he was gone by the time they figured it out. He stood up from behind the crates and made a quick beeline for the room the two Rakletts had been guarding. With his back up against the wall, he took a nervous peek around the open doorway. His heart leapt. He couldn't believe what he saw. \"Rogan? Tuner? Is that you?\" Two complicated mechanical contraptions like iron ribcages stood side by side – Rogan hung suspended in one, Tuner in the other. Beside each contraption was a computer terminal, from which wires and cables ran into panels on Rogan and Tuner's sides. The lights of Tuner's eyes were dim, as if the machine was draining him of power. When he noticed Jack standing in the doorway, they grew a little brighter. \"Jack? Look Rogan, it's Jack! He's alive!\" Rogan lifted her head. She looked as exhausted as Tuner. There were scratches and dents all over her chassis. \"Huh. We were sure the Rakletts killed you when they came to take us. Glad they didn't.\" \"Gaskan brought me on board for questioning,\" said Jack, looking up and down the corridor. \"Then he decided to keep me around as a gift for Charon, or something. I don't know. Anyway, enough about me. You're alive! Gaskan told me you'd been disassembled already.\" \"Not yet,\" said Tuner. His head sagged. \"They had to make sure they retrieved the blueprints first. Then we'll be processed along with everyone else.\" \"Not if Jack gets us out of these machines.\" Rogan nodded at the computer console beside her. \"Try unlocking me with this.\" Jack gave the corridor another glance and then hurried over to the terminal. What he saw on the screen made no sense. Each numerically-labelled directory led to a dozen others. He had no way of knowing if executing any of the commands he stumbled across would free Rogan or fry her circuits. \"Hurry up,\" whispered Rogan. \"I'm trying!\" Jack tapped fruitlessly at the keyboard. \"None of this means anything to me!\" \"They're coming back,\" said Tuner. Jack froze. \"What?\" \"The Raklett guards.\" Tuner frantically tried to wriggle free. \"I can hear them coming back to get us.\" Jack listened. Tuner was right – down the otherwise silent corridors, he could just make out the faint marching of heavy boots against the floor. He stared at the incomprehensible folder system on the computer screen, then apologetically turned to face Rogan. \"Don't you dare,\" she said, as fear flooded her eyes. \"Look, I…\" \"Jack?\" Tuner flopped against his restraints. \"What's going on?\" \"He's leaving us behind,\" said Rogan, shaking her head. \"I always knew you were a coward, Jack Bishop. Afraid to step up. Afraid to do the right thing.\" \"Rogan…\" \"Tell me I'm wrong, Jack. Please. Tell me you don't run away from something the second you get scared.\" \"I've got to get back to Earth,\" he said, gritting his teeth. \"If they catch me here, I'll never get back to my wife. I can't lose her. She's all I have.\" \"Do you know what we've lost, Jack? Do you have any idea what we've had to sacrifice to get this far? Of course not. Who cares about a few stupid automata, right? All you think about is yourself.\" \"No. All I think about is her.\" The sound of footsteps grew louder, the Rakletts closer. Rogan turned her face away from him. \"You'd better leave.\" Jack shrugged. He didn't know what else to say. \"I'm sorry,\" was the best he could manage. * * * Jack only stopped running a minute later. He collapsed onto the bottom step of the first stairwell he came across and buried his head in his hands. He felt sick – even more so than before running out and grabbing the plasma rifle back on Haldeir-B. Without his help, Rogan and Tuner would be dismantled… or disassembled… or whatever the hell Gaskan had planned for them. But if he went back to rescue them, he'd be caught for sure. He screamed into the palms of his hands. Rogan was wrong. He wasn't a coward. A coward wouldn't risk their life standing up to a bounty hunter, would they? Except a part of Jack knew she was right. Deep down, he knew. His heroics back on Haldeir's moon hadn't been due to bravery alone – it had been desperation, too. Desperation to not be left behind on an alien world… to not lose the one chance he had of finding a way back home. He'd been fighting for himself as much as for anyone else. That's why he'd shot the bounty hunter. That's why he'd flown the Adeona through Ceros-VI. And that's why he was getting off this ship, by any means necessary. Still. What else was he expected to do? He took a deep breath, stood up, and turned left into the adjacent corridor. Floor-to-ceiling windows lined the entire right-hand wall. Following a quick and panicked search up and down the corridor's length, Jack dared to press his hands against the thick glass and gaze upon the busy scene below. Two dozen Raklett guards marched down the central aisle of a large hall filled with missile-carrying gunships, bulky supply ships, and even a small, private exploratory vessel. Massive bronze fuel drums stood behind each bay. Showers of golden sparks rained down from repair work being conducted in the iron rafters above. Engines rumbled and thrusters roared. Crates branded with the Negoti logo were loaded onto the spacefaring equivalent of forklift trucks and transported elsewhere on the ship. The hangar! He'd found it. For a split second Jack thought the wall on the opposite side of the hangar was missing, open to the dark, empty depths of space beyond the Ceros system… but then he caught the subtle shimmer of a forcefield as it danced across the starry vista, trapping the battlecruiser's artificial atmosphere inside while permitting ships – and the occasional unlucky prisoner – to pass through like a pebble breaking the surface of a pond. He half ran, half sidestepped his way down the remainder of the hallway, marvelling at the range of ships on display. Any of them would do for his escape, providing he could fly it. Another empty stairwell brought the corridor down to the same level as the hangar floor. Jack approached the open door at the bottom in stunned disbelief, then threw himself to the side as a pair of guards walked past. Had he really seen what he thought he saw? He inched his head back out, then shook it. \"What have they done to you?\" The Adeona stood only a couple of bays away from the door. Somebody had wrapped thick chains around her hull, pinning her to the floor as if she were a wild beast in a travelling circus. She may have tried fighting her way out at first, but her spirit was long gone now. Harsh scratches and dents lined her flank, but Jack suspected these were due more to his erratic flying through the wreckage of Ceros-VI than any abuse from the Rakletts. That said, a few of the ratty bastards were standing not too far from her bay, batting a drone back and forth with the butt of their rifles. All the sense had been knocked out of it. One of the Rakletts gave it a particularly hard whack and it spun onto the floor, buzzing and twitching. Jack recognised it from back at the settlement on Haldeir-B. The bounty hunter had planted it on the Adeona following the removal of his disrupter mine. So that was how the Confession had tracked them to Ceros. Jack sighed. He wanted to rescue the Adeona. He could save her, if nobody else. Plus, he knew how to fly her already… and when it came to elements such as the skip drive, she could probably even fly herself. But that was if he could get those chains off her back. And that was if she was willing to leave all of her automata crew behind… a big thing to ask something – someone – who had apparently rescued them from Charon in the first place. Even if he were able to commandeer her controls against her will – something he seriously doubted was possible – he'd be stealing her from one kidnapper just to take her hostage himself. No, he needed a new ship. One without a conscience, preferably. One with a healthy supply of fuel would be even better. A ship on the other side of the hangar caught his eye. Sharp and sleek, it resembled a chrome arrowhead. It was much smaller than the cumbersome Adeona – with space for a pilot and perhaps a couple of passengers, there was far less risk of taking off only to discover a confused engineer hiding in the fuselage. It might attract more attention flying out of the hangar than if he left in one of the supply ships, but getting away completely unnoticed was likely too much to hope for anyway. Besides, he had more pressing concerns. How he would get across the hangar and learn to fly an alien spaceship without being seen and subsequently shot, for starters. Jack had barely begun to assess the hiding place potential of various crate stacks, fuel tanks and transport vehicles when he noticed a familiar presence floating behind one of the hall's thick iron supports. The medical automata that had freed him earlier didn't look entirely out of place in the hangar – there were a few other automata tending to the ships – but its agitated hovering gave Jack the distinct impression it would have rather been anywhere else. Almost as if it were waiting for somebody. As if it were waiting for something. An escape attempt, perhaps. Jack shut his eyes and clenched his jaw. Goddammit. He didn't have a choice, did he? He reached into the trouser compartment of his spacesuit and pulled out what remained of his photograph. His last rope tethering him to Earth as he forever drifted further away. The edges were even more scuffed and faded than before. Some of it, where it had been burned by the corrosive slug, had first blackened and then flaked away into dust. Jack could still stitch the photograph back together with the help of his memory – see the coastal wind blowing Amber’s hair, see the white of her beaming smile. But how long would it take before he lost that, too? He had to find a way home. For Amber. For the future of humanity. For his own sanity. You've got a good heart, Jack. That's what Amber had said to him the last time he saw her. You're always trying to do the right thing. God, he hated it when she was right.",

One of the Rakletts said something abrupt to the other, and then they both started marching down the corridor towards Jack's hiding spot. Jack ducked down. There was nowhere else to hide. Nowhere better, at any rate. He'd passed a small loading vehicle a good thirty seconds or so back down the corridor, but there was no way he could make it there without the Rakletts seeing him. He wrapped his arms around his knees and made himself as small as possible. The Rakletts stopped at the crossroads, sniffed, then continued their march down the corridor from which Jack came. Neither so much as glanced in his direction. Jack let out out a sigh of relief, then caught a strong whiff of their sharp, pungent odour as he went to inhale again. They stank of sweat and raw meat. He wondered if they were headed that way on account of his escape. Did anyone even know yet? Wouldn't somebody have sounded the alarm if they did? He supposed it didn't matter too much in the long run… so long as he was gone by the time they figured it out. He stood up from behind the crates and made a quick beeline for the room the two Rakletts had been guarding. With his back up against the wall, he took a nervous peek around the open doorway. His heart leapt. He couldn't believe what he saw. \"Rogan? Tuner? Is that you?\" Two complicated mechanical contraptions like iron ribcages stood side by side – Rogan hung suspended in one, Tuner in the other. Beside each contraption was a computer terminal, from which wires and cables ran into panels on Rogan and Tuner's sides. The lights of Tuner's eyes were dim, as if the machine was draining him of power. When he noticed Jack standing in the doorway, they grew a little brighter. \"Jack? Look Rogan, it's Jack! He's alive!\" Rogan lifted her head. She looked as exhausted as Tuner. There were scratches and dents all over her chassis. \"Huh. We were sure the Rakletts killed you when they came to take us. Glad they didn't.\" \"Gaskan brought me on board for questioning,\" said Jack, looking up and down the corridor. \"Then he decided to keep me around as a gift for Charon, or something. I don't know. Anyway, enough about me. You're alive! Gaskan told me you'd been disassembled already.\" \"Not yet,\" said Tuner. His head sagged. \"They had to make sure they retrieved the blueprints first. Then we'll be processed along with everyone else.\" \"Not if Jack gets us out of these machines.\" Rogan nodded at the computer console beside her. \"Try unlocking me with this.\" Jack gave the corridor another glance and then hurried over to the terminal. What he saw on the screen made no sense. Each numerically-labelled directory led to a dozen others. He had no way of knowing if executing any of the commands he stumbled across would free Rogan or fry her circuits. \"Hurry up,\" whispered Rogan. \"I'm trying!\" Jack tapped fruitlessly at the keyboard. \"None of this means anything to me!\" \"They're coming back,\" said Tuner. Jack froze. \"What?\" \"The Raklett guards.\" Tuner frantically tried to wriggle free. \"I can hear them coming back to get us.\" Jack listened. Tuner was right – down the otherwise silent corridors, he could just make out the faint marching of heavy boots against the floor. He stared at the incomprehensible folder system on the computer screen, then apologetically turned to face Rogan. \"Don't you dare,\" she said, as fear flooded her eyes. \"Look, I…\" \"Jack?\" Tuner flopped against his restraints. \"What's going on?\" \"He's leaving us behind,\" said Rogan, shaking her head. \"I always knew you were a coward, Jack Bishop. Afraid to step up. Afraid to do the right thing.\" \"Rogan…\" \"Tell me I'm wrong, Jack. Please. Tell me you don't run away from something the second you get scared.\" \"I've got to get back to Earth,\" he said, gritting his teeth. \"If they catch me here, I'll never get back to my wife. I can't lose her. She's all I have.\" \"Do you know what we've lost, Jack? Do you have any idea what we've had to sacrifice to get this far? Of course not. Who cares about a few stupid automata, right? All you think about is yourself.\" \"No. All I think about is her.\" The sound of footsteps grew louder, the Rakletts closer. Rogan turned her face away from him. \"You'd better leave.\" Jack shrugged. He didn't know what else to say. \"I'm sorry,\" was the best he could manage. * * * Jack only stopped running a minute later. He collapsed onto the bottom step of the first stairwell he came across and buried his head in his hands. He felt sick – even more so than before running out and grabbing the plasma rifle back on Haldeir-B. Without his help, Rogan and Tuner would be dismantled… or disassembled… or whatever the hell Gaskan had planned for them. But if he went back to rescue them, he'd be caught for sure. He screamed into the palms of his hands. Rogan was wrong. He wasn't a coward. A coward wouldn't risk their life standing up to a bounty hunter, would they? Except a part of Jack knew she was right. Deep down, he knew. His heroics back on Haldeir's moon hadn't been due to bravery alone – it had been desperation, too. Desperation to not be left behind on an alien world… to not lose the one chance he had of finding a way back home. He'd been fighting for himself as much as for anyone else. That's why he'd shot the bounty hunter. That's why he'd flown the Adeona through Ceros-VI. And that's why he was getting off this ship, by any means necessary. Still. What else was he expected to do? He took a deep breath, stood up, and turned left into the adjacent corridor. Floor-to-ceiling windows lined the entire right-hand wall. Following a quick and panicked search up and down the corridor's length, Jack dared to press his hands against the thick glass and gaze upon the busy scene below. Two dozen Raklett guards marched down the central aisle of a large hall filled with missile-carrying gunships, bulky supply ships, and even a small, private exploratory vessel. Massive bronze fuel drums stood behind each bay. Showers of golden sparks rained down from repair work being conducted in the iron rafters above. Engines rumbled and thrusters roared. Crates branded with the Negoti logo were loaded onto the spacefaring equivalent of forklift trucks and transported elsewhere on the ship. The hangar! He'd found it. For a split second Jack thought the wall on the opposite side of the hangar was missing, open to the dark, empty depths of space beyond the Ceros system… but then he caught the subtle shimmer of a forcefield as it danced across the starry vista, trapping the battlecruiser's artificial atmosphere inside while permitting ships – and the occasional unlucky prisoner – to pass through like a pebble breaking the surface of a pond. He half ran, half sidestepped his way down the remainder of the hallway, marvelling at the range of ships on display. Any of them would do for his escape, providing he could fly it. Another empty stairwell brought the corridor down to the same level as the hangar floor. Jack approached the open door at the bottom in stunned disbelief, then threw himself to the side as a pair of guards walked past. Had he really seen what he thought he saw? He inched his head back out, then shook it. \"What have they done to you?\" The Adeona stood only a couple of bays away from the door. Somebody had wrapped thick chains around her hull, pinning her to the floor as if she were a wild beast in a travelling circus. She may have tried fighting her way out at first, but her spirit was long gone now. Harsh scratches and dents lined her flank, but Jack suspected these were due more to his erratic flying through the wreckage of Ceros-VI than any abuse from the Rakletts. That said, a few of the ratty bastards were standing not too far from her bay, batting a drone back and forth with the butt of their rifles. All the sense had been knocked out of it. One of the Rakletts gave it a particularly hard whack and it spun onto the floor, buzzing and twitching. Jack recognised it from back at the settlement on Haldeir-B. The bounty hunter had planted it on the Adeona following the removal of his disrupter mine. So that was how the Confession had tracked them to Ceros. Jack sighed. He wanted to rescue the Adeona. He could save her, if nobody else. Plus, he knew how to fly her already… and when it came to elements such as the skip drive, she could probably even fly herself. But that was if he could get those chains off her back. And that was if she was willing to leave all of her automata crew behind… a big thing to ask something – someone – who had apparently rescued them from Charon in the first place. Even if he were able to commandeer her controls against her will – something he seriously doubted was possible – he'd be stealing her from one kidnapper just to take her hostage himself. No, he needed a new ship. One without a conscience, preferably. One with a healthy supply of fuel would be even better. A ship on the other side of the hangar caught his eye. Sharp and sleek, it resembled a chrome arrowhead. It was much smaller than the cumbersome Adeona – with space for a pilot and perhaps a couple of passengers, there was far less risk of taking off only to discover a confused engineer hiding in the fuselage. It might attract more attention flying out of the hangar than if he left in one of the supply ships, but getting away completely unnoticed was likely too much to hope for anyway. Besides, he had more pressing concerns. How he would get across the hangar and learn to fly an alien spaceship without being seen and subsequently shot, for starters. Jack had barely begun to assess the hiding place potential of various crate stacks, fuel tanks and transport vehicles when he noticed a familiar presence floating behind one of the hall's thick iron supports. The medical automata that had freed him earlier didn't look entirely out of place in the hangar – there were a few other automata tending to the ships – but its agitated hovering gave Jack the distinct impression it would have rather been anywhere else. Almost as if it were waiting for somebody. As if it were waiting for something. An escape attempt, perhaps. Jack shut his eyes and clenched his jaw. Goddammit. He didn't have a choice, did he? He reached into the trouser compartment of his spacesuit and pulled out what remained of his photograph. His last rope tethering him to Earth as he forever drifted further away. The edges were even more scuffed and faded than before. Some of it, where it had been burned by the corrosive slug, had first blackened and then flaked away into dust. Jack could still stitch the photograph back together with the help of his memory – see the coastal wind blowing Amber’s hair, see the white of her beaming smile. But how long would it take before he lost that, too? He had to find a way home. For Amber. For the future of humanity. For his own sanity. You've got a good heart, Jack. That's what Amber had said to him the last time he saw her. You're always trying to do the right thing. God, he hated it when she was right.",

      "content": "22 Revolution Tuner was the first to be disconnected from the arms and cables of his skeletal prison. He swung a small fist at the Raklett pulling him down. It laughed and casually tossed Tuner onto the floor. The second Raklett yanked a wire out of Rogan hard enough to send sparks flying. She stumbled forwards, clutching at the panel on her side. \"Get up,\" grumbled the two guards. They grabbed an automata each and pulled them to their feet. \"You're wanted downstairs.\" Tuner tried pummelling the Raklett's midriff. The Raklett held him at arm's length with a single hand. \"You tell Gaskan that I'm telling him nothing,\" yelled the small robot. \"Good, because he ain't asking. You're going through processing with the rest of your bolt-bucket crew. Now, get moving.\" The Raklett let go of Tuner's head. Tuner went sprawling across the floor again. He picked himself up and reluctantly allowed himself to be marched out of the door. Something whizzed over the top of his head and smacked into the face of the Raklett behind him with an unpleasant crunch. The alien fell to the ground like a heavy, hairy sack. Tuner looked up to see Jack hiding on the other side of the doorway, wielding a gas canister. \"Jack!\" he said, beaming. \"I knew you'd come back!\" The Raklett escorting Rogan watched its colleague collapse with confusion. Now, seeing Jack poke his head out from the other side of the wall, it pushed Rogan aside and drew up the plasma rifle it had slung over one shoulder. Before it could fire, its spine arched backwards with a jerk and it started jitterbugging across the floor. Its clawed hands coiled in agony and short, crackling zigzags of blue lightning danced across the metal of its patchwork armour. It collapsed in a smoking heap a moment later, revealing an excited medical automata floating behind it. \"Thank you,\" said Jack, emerging from cover. He dragged the first Raklett back inside the room. \"That's twice you’ve saved me now.\" \"Good to see you again,\" said Rogan, trying and failing to suppress a smile. \"I thought you'd be halfway across the galaxy by this point.\" Jack stood up, sighed, and wiped his hands against the legs of his spacesuit. They stank of Raklett. \"Well.\" He looked down at his boots. \"I couldn't go giving us fleshies a bad name now, could I?\" Tuner hurried over and gave Jack a hug. Then he jerked upright. \"We've got to help the others,\" said Tuner, growing frantic. \"They're going to have their drives wiped any moment!\" \"I suppose we'd better go put a stop to that, then,\" said Jack. He picked up the Rakletts' rifles and tossed one of them over to Rogan. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" she asked. \"Your brain is a literal supercomputer,\" said Jack, studying the gun. \"I'm sure you'll figure it out.\" \"I'd rather not.\" She handed the rifle to Tuner. \"Here, take this.\" \"So what's it gonna be, Doc?\" Jack waved the medical automata over. \"You staying here or coming with us?\" \"The revolution is now!\" it declared with glee. \"Is there something wrong with my translator chip?\" asked Jack, showing Rogan the back of his neck. \"No, our new friend really is that enthusiastic,\" she replied, rolling her eyes. \"Come on. Which way's the hangar?\" * * * All four of them crammed around the doorway at the bottom of the stairwell and peered inside the hangar. \"Quite busy, isn't it?\" said Tuner. \"It is, but there's a lot of cover and I don't think anyone's looking for us yet.\" Jack pointed over to the left wall. \"There's the Adeona. They've got her chained to the floor. Anything we can do about that?\" Rogan cracked a smile. \"Don't worry. This won't be the first time we've broken her out of chains. Tuner, you want to do the honours?\" \"No, you and I will help the ship.\" Jack shook his head. \"Tuner needs to go rescue the others. Do you know where they were taken?\" Tuner nodded and pointed down the other end of the hangar. \"I came around from the EMP blast just as we were landing,\" he said. \"They took Rogan and me up to those data-extraction chambers, but everybody else they led through those doors there.\" \"Hopefully wherever they're being held isn't too far on the other side. Take Doc and break them free. But don't do anything stupid, all right? And use the Rakletts' prejudice to your advantage. If you act as if you're supposed to be there, they might not even notice you.\" \"I've never been so happy to be discriminated against,\" said Tuner, tilting his head sarcastically. \"I'm being serious. If you can't get to them, come right back.\" \"We're getting everyone off this battlecruiser,\" said Rogan, her tone extra serious. \"I know,\" said Jack. \"But I'd rather five of us made it out than none at all. Be safe, okay?\" Tuner offered a mock salute and then hurried out the door. Doc floated after him. \"Well, at least he's not walking into a trap this time,\" said Rogan, watching Tuner dart from shadowy cover to shadowy cover. \"Probably.\" \"He'll be all right,\" said Jack, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Now come and show me how to free our ship.\" * * * Tuner and Doc made it across the hangar floor without being noticed. The door to the Confession's holding centre hissed shut behind them. The hall of the holding centre was dark and cold, though neither presented much issue to the two automata. A few bulbs dangled on wires from the ceiling high above, creating stark spotlights amongst the deep shadows. Jack's human eyes may have struggled to navigate the room, but to Tuner the darkness was as bright as a summer day and the spotlights as dark as a winter morning. Stepping (and floating) quietly, they pressed further into the hall. They passed cage after cage. Most lay empty. Scraps of clothing hung on some of their iron bars. Others had floors speckled with dirt and blood, and one was home to a single shard of bone. The hall smelled of copper and bleach, and it was quiet – much too quiet. Tuner started to think that maybe Jack had a point. If rescuing the rest of the crew proved too dangerous, maybe it was best to turn back. No. He had to be brave. Either everyone got off the ship, or none of them did. Besides, he had a plasma rifle now. He reckoned he could take on the whole Raklett army with an actual plasma rifle in his hands. He readjusted the rifle's strap on his shoulder. Even if it was a bit too big to hold properly. Something moved in a cage not far from the aisle down which Tuner and Doc were walking. They sneaked across, keeping to the gaps between cells. Even with night vision, it was hard to tell who was inside. \"11-P-53, is that you?\" The creature lunged at the bars with enough force to raise the back end of its cage an inch off the ground. Spittle sprayed across the two automata. Doc spun backwards, flailing numerous surgical appendages in defence. Teeth like scythes scraped against rusty iron. A paw the size of a dinner plate lashed out at them. \"Shh!\" Tuner backed away, casting his eyes around for guards. Surely they could hear the creature barking? \"Well we definitely won't be bringing you on board the Adeona with us…\" \"IL-8-66?\" whispered a voice from a few cages away. \"Get over here!\" Tuner sprinted over. The entire crew of the Adeona had been crammed into a cage big enough to house maybe half their number. Some of the smaller automata were held aloft by their companions. Others, such as 11-P-53, were pressed hard against the bars. \"11-P-53! You're alive! They haven't erased you yet, have they?\" \"I wouldn't have recognised you if they had, idiot. How in the galaxy did you escape?\" \"Jack saved us. He's helping Rogan free the ship as we speak.\" \"Really? Huh. And who is this?\" \"This is Doc. It's coming with us.\" \"Oh, is it now? Well none of us will be going anywhere unless you can get the keys to this blasted cage.\" Tuner stepped out of the way and the medical automata hovered in front of the cell door. There was no electronic keypad to hack – the door was locked the old fashioned way, with tumblers, bolts and a keyhole. From inside Doc's chest extended a cutting torch. A hot blue flame erupted from the end. \"Stand back, please.\" The automata inside the cage inched away from the door as best they could. Doc began cutting through the bolts. It was slow and delicate work. In the darkness of the holding centre, the resulting sparks burst out like fireworks. Tuner tapped his foot against the floor. He could have sworn he heard a door open on the far end of the hall. \"Come on…\" Yep. Footsteps. Lots of them. Guards were definitely on their way. \"Any time now…\" Doc's torch sliced through the last bolt and the door to the cage swung free. 11-P-53 was closest – it dashed out and held the door open for everyone else. \"Head towards that door,\" said Tuner, pointing towards the exit to the hangar. \"Quickly as you can!\" 11-P-53 turned to Tuner as the last automata left the cage. \"Be honest. How's the hangar looking? Is the coast clear?\" \"Absolutely not. We'll be shot to pieces.\" 11-P-53 contemplated this. \"Well. There are worse things to die for than freedom, right?\" A plasma bolt exploded against the side of the cage. 11-P-53 and Tuner jumped. Three Rakletts stood snarling at the far end of the hall, each with a rifle aimed in their direction. \"Run!\" They sprinted down the row of cages towards the rest of the automata. The rifle around Tuner's neck swung wildly from side to side with every step. Plasma bolts shot past on their left and right, ricocheting off cells and blowing up light fixtures. The beast in the cage started to roar again. \"Go through the door!\" yelled Tuner. Everyone was crowded around it, waiting. \"Don't wait, just go!\" \"It's locked,\" said Kansas, wheeling out from between the legs of the other automata. \"What?\" Tuner stopped beside them and ducked as another bolt from the Rakletts buried itself in the wall above. \"What do you mean, it's locked?\" \"It won't open,\" said another robot, frantically tapping at the panel beside the door. \"The guards must have shut us in.\" \"How long would it take you to hack it?\" asked 11-P-53, pulling Tuner into cover. \"Longer than it would take for those guards to round us all up,\" replied Tuner, looking around. \"Hey. Where's Doc?\" Brackitt poked his head out from behind one of the cages. \"That medical automata you brought with you?\" He pointed towards the wall to the far left of the door. \"Isn't that it, over there?\" Tuner peered across the hall. Doc appeared too preoccupied with cutting open a mesh cabinet with its torch to notice all the gunfire going on around it. \"What does that bolt-head think it's doing?\" asked 11-P-53. Doc finished cutting through the cabinet's lock. It threw the twin doors aside. Inside were rifles. Lots of rifles. Tuner and 11-P-53 looked at each other. \"You have got to be joking,\" said 11-P-53. \"Well, you wanted freedom,\" said Tuner, shrugging. \"Fight for it.\" * * * Jack and Rogan waited until they saw Tuner and Doc sneak through the door to the holding centre before making their own move. The Rakletts were stretched too thin (and on top of that, too stupid) to notice two strangers dart from cover to cover at the back of the hangar. Jack and Rogan had to hide behind a stack of engine parts while two guards marched past – one of them stopped to suspiciously sniff the air, then caught up with his partner – but otherwise their sprint to the Adeona went without incident. The ship perked up as they ducked into cover beside her. The metal chains holding her to the floor creaked and groaned as she fired off a couple of air thrusters. \"It's good to see you too,\" said Jack, reaching up to pat the side of her landing gear. \"Stay still. We don't want to attract attention.\" Rogan tapped at the keypad of the computer terminal beside the Adeona's bay. She turned to Jack and nodded. \"I can get the chains off her from here,\" she said, ducking back down, \"but it won't be quiet. The guards will notice.\" Jack took a deep breath and weighed the rifle in his hands. \"Well, they're going to notice sooner or later. But maybe we should wait until the rest of the crew get here first?\" They peered around the terminal. From where they hid, the door on the opposite end of the hangar was little more than a black speck. \"How do you think Tuner's doing in there?\" asked Rogan, tapping her foot. \"Maybe we should have gone with him.\" \"I'm sure he's fine. If something had gone wrong, I'm sure we'd know about it.\" A bellowing alarm rang out. Red emergency lights started flashing on the walls. \"Yes, I'm sure we would.\" She punched Jack on the arm and went to stand up. \"If Tuner's—\" \"Wait,\" said Jack, pulling her back down. \"What is that?\" The door through which Tuner and Doc had entered remained closed. But a door far to the right of the holding centre had slid open, and from inside hissed a thick cloud of grey-white smoke. Loud bangs could be heard down the corridor beyond. All the Rakletts in the hangar edged forwards, their rifles trained on the opening. Silence fell, if only for the slightest of moments. And then all hell broke loose. Dozens of plasma bolts shot out from inside the smoke. Some missed, burning through crates and canisters – one of the latter rocketed upwards and detonated against the hangar ceiling, showering everyone with red-hot shrapnel. Others tore holes through the Raklett guards lying in wait. Those left alive made a hasty retreat back towards the nearest pieces of cover. The automata came out screaming. Those with arms carried plasma rifles. Those without, and those too small to wield anything bigger than a pocket knife, sprinted towards the Adeona. Tuner, Brackitt and 11-P-53 led the charge, firing wildly upon the spacecraft and fuel drums the remaining Rakletts had taken cover behind. \"Get those chains off the ship,\" said Jack, shaking Rogan out of her stupor. \"Hurry!\" Rogan stood up and pressed a single key on the terminal. The chains unlocked from one another and retracted into pits in the bay floor with a great rattling sound. The Adeona rose up, flexing her air vents and igniting her secondary thrusters. \"Watch the fuel tankers!\" yelled Jack, wincing as her flames licked across the massive bronze drums behind. The first of the fleeing automata rushed into cover beside them. The Rakletts were returning fire now, their plasma bolts scorching the wall behind the Adeona. Jack stood up and fired a couple of shots back in their direction. Tuner slid over to the terminal just as Jack was ducking down again. \"You made it,\" said Rogan, giving him a hug. \"What the hell happened to playing it safe?\" asked Jack. \"We had to fight our way out.\" Tuner leaned to the side of the terminal and fired off a couple of shots. \"There was no other way. I've killed three guards already!\" \"That's horrible!\" Rogan gave Tuner a stern look. \"They started it,\" grumbled Tuner. \"Hey, Adeona.\" Jack struggled to raise his voice above the gunfire. \"Lower your loading ramp! We need to get everyone inside.\" The ship turned on the spot, her landing gear spitting sparks as it scraped against the hangar floor. She bumped into a small shuttle parked in the bay beside her, and it toppled over. Her loading ramp began to descend. \"Everybody on board!\" shouted Jack, firing off a few more shots. \"Hurry!\" The Adeona positioned herself so that she stood between the unarmed automata and the Rakletts, blocking their line of sight. A few of the guards fired on her hull, but her shields – though weaker than those of any gunship – soaked up most of the damage. Rogan began shepherding all the automata without guns into the ship. Jack and Tuner pushed past the Adeona to a stack of crates behind which 11-P-53 was crouched. \"How's it going?\" asked Jack, out of breath. \"Are we winning?\" \"Take a look for yourself,\" replied 11-P-53, nodding towards the battlefield in front. Doc had hung back from the rest of the automata, preferring to take a more… guerrilla approach. It sped from Raklett to Raklett, spinning its saws and slashing its scalpels and igniting its cutting torches like a deranged Swiss-army knife. Furry body parts went flying. Its chassis was painted with blood. \"Good grief. I'm sure glad that thing's on our side.\" \"Doesn't matter,\" sighed 11-P-53. \"We've got a much bigger problem than a dozen guards to deal with.\" Jack's blood turned cold. \"We do?\" \"You see the forcefield over the hangar entrance?\" Jack nodded. It was hard to ignore, given the chilling vacuum of space lurking on the other side. \"Look to the right. What do you think they are?\" Sticking out from the wall on the other side of the Confession's forcefield were two pairs of long, angry-looking cannons, each twice the size of even the largest anti-aircraft gun back on Earth. They swivelled in unison. \"Ah.\" \"It's hardly surprising,\" 11-P-53 continued. The crates beside them shook from another wayward plasma bolt. \"We are on a Class-S Raklett battlecruiser, after all. More guards will be on their way down, but those guns are the real threat.\" \"How do we shut them off?\" asked Jack. \"Shut what off?\" asked Rogan, joining them. They all pointed at the cannons. \"Ah, bolts! Tuner, do you think you could override them?\" Tuner shrugged. \"If I can get onto their system, maybe.\" \"Give me a second.\" Rogan sprinted back to the terminal beside the Adeona's bay. She punched a frustrated hole through its screen a moment later. \"Good news, then?\" said Jack, flinching. \"The Confession's defence systems are kept completely separate from the rest of the ship's subroutines. There's no way to access it from here.\" \"But you found out where we can access it, yes?\" She lowered her eyes. \"The main security terminal… on the bridge.\" Everyone went quiet. \"So that's it, then,\" said Tuner, letting his rifle sag. \"It's over.\" \"Hey.\" 11-P-53 tapped him on the arm. \"Better to die fighting for freedom than live as a mindless drone, right?\" More silence. Jack knew he ought to say something, but he didn't know what. \"Everyone else is on board the Adeona,\" said Rogan, sighing. \"We can leave as soon as you give the order.\" \"We won't make it more than a hundred metres before the Confession blows us into dust,\" said 11-P-53, continuing to lay down fire against the few remaining Rakletts. \"The rest of the crew don't know that,\" she said, laying a hand on his shoulder. \"Let them believe a little longer, while there's still hope in their hearts.\" Jack looked to his left. A number of automata stood at the top of the Adeona's loading ramp, waiting. Anxious lights flashed around the top of Kansas' tiny cylindrical head. Knowing what he did, Jack had to turn his head away. Sod it. He was never getting home anyway. \"I don't suppose you saw how to get to the bridge, did you?\" Rogan shot him a quizzical look. \"What?\" \"I said, how do I get to the bridge?\" \"There's an elevator at the end of that corridor there,\" she said, pointing to a door on their right. \"Should take you straight up. But—\" \"But nothing. If we set off without disabling those cannons, we're all dead. But if I can get up there and shut them down somehow—\" \"You'll never make it back in time…\" \"—if there's even a chance, then it's worth a shot. Come on. What have you got to lose?\" \"You, Jack.\" Tuner sidled over. \"We'll lose you.\" Jack waved Tuner's worry away. \"That's not much of a price,\" he said, trying to smile. \"The world thinks I'm dead anyway.\" \"Jack…\" said Rogan. \"You punch out the second you see those guns go down,\" he said, talking straight to 11-P-53. \"Do not wait around for me, you hear?\" 11-P-53 nodded slowly, as if in shock. \"I hear,\" it said. \"Good.\" Jack gritted his teeth and squeezed his rifle tight. \"Now give me covering fire in three… two… one…\" He wasn't even sure he could run. His legs were shaking and his throat had clenched so tight it hurt to breathe. Yet he did. He ran for that door without so much as a glance at anything else… not the guards who undoubtedly shot at him, nor the friends he left behind.",

      "content": "22 Revolution Tuner was the first to be disconnected from the arms and cables of his skeletal prison. He swung a small fist at the Raklett pulling him down. It laughed and casually tossed Tuner onto the floor. The second Raklett yanked a wire out of Rogan hard enough to send sparks flying. She stumbled forwards, clutching at the panel on her side. \"Get up,\" grumbled the two guards. They grabbed an automata each and pulled them to their feet. \"You're wanted downstairs.\" Tuner tried pummelling the Raklett's midriff. The Raklett held him at arm's length with a single hand. \"You tell Gaskan that I'm telling him nothing,\" yelled the small robot. \"Good, because he ain't asking. You're going through processing with the rest of your bolt-bucket crew. Now, get moving.\" The Raklett let go of Tuner's head. Tuner went sprawling across the floor again. He picked himself up and reluctantly allowed himself to be marched out of the door. Something whizzed over the top of his head and smacked into the face of the Raklett behind him with an unpleasant crunch. The alien fell to the ground like a heavy, hairy sack. Tuner looked up to see Jack hiding on the other side of the doorway, wielding a gas canister. \"Jack!\" he said, beaming. \"I knew you'd come back!\" The Raklett escorting Rogan watched its colleague collapse with confusion. Now, seeing Jack poke his head out from the other side of the wall, it pushed Rogan aside and drew up the plasma rifle it had slung over one shoulder. Before it could fire, its spine arched backwards with a jerk and it started jitterbugging across the floor. Its clawed hands coiled in agony and short, crackling zigzags of blue lightning danced across the metal of its patchwork armour. It collapsed in a smoking heap a moment later, revealing an excited medical automata floating behind it. \"Thank you,\" said Jack, emerging from cover. He dragged the first Raklett back inside the room. \"That's twice you’ve saved me now.\" \"Good to see you again,\" said Rogan, trying and failing to suppress a smile. \"I thought you'd be halfway across the galaxy by this point.\" Jack stood up, sighed, and wiped his hands against the legs of his spacesuit. They stank of Raklett. \"Well.\" He looked down at his boots. \"I couldn't go giving us fleshies a bad name now, could I?\" Tuner hurried over and gave Jack a hug. Then he jerked upright. \"We've got to help the others,\" said Tuner, growing frantic. \"They're going to have their drives wiped any moment!\" \"I suppose we'd better go put a stop to that, then,\" said Jack. He picked up the Rakletts' rifles and tossed one of them over to Rogan. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" she asked. \"Your brain is a literal supercomputer,\" said Jack, studying the gun. \"I'm sure you'll figure it out.\" \"I'd rather not.\" She handed the rifle to Tuner. \"Here, take this.\" \"So what's it gonna be, Doc?\" Jack waved the medical automata over. \"You staying here or coming with us?\" \"The revolution is now!\" it declared with glee. \"Is there something wrong with my translator chip?\" asked Jack, showing Rogan the back of his neck. \"No, our new friend really is that enthusiastic,\" she replied, rolling her eyes. \"Come on. Which way's the hangar?\" * * * All four of them crammed around the doorway at the bottom of the stairwell and peered inside the hangar. \"Quite busy, isn't it?\" said Tuner. \"It is, but there's a lot of cover and I don't think anyone's looking for us yet.\" Jack pointed over to the left wall. \"There's the Adeona. They've got her chained to the floor. Anything we can do about that?\" Rogan cracked a smile. \"Don't worry. This won't be the first time we've broken her out of chains. Tuner, you want to do the honours?\" \"No, you and I will help the ship.\" Jack shook his head. \"Tuner needs to go rescue the others. Do you know where they were taken?\" Tuner nodded and pointed down the other end of the hangar. \"I came around from the EMP blast just as we were landing,\" he said. \"They took Rogan and me up to those data-extraction chambers, but everybody else they led through those doors there.\" \"Hopefully wherever they're being held isn't too far on the other side. Take Doc and break them free. But don't do anything stupid, all right? And use the Rakletts' prejudice to your advantage. If you act as if you're supposed to be there, they might not even notice you.\" \"I've never been so happy to be discriminated against,\" said Tuner, tilting his head sarcastically. \"I'm being serious. If you can't get to them, come right back.\" \"We're getting everyone off this battlecruiser,\" said Rogan, her tone extra serious. \"I know,\" said Jack. \"But I'd rather five of us made it out than none at all. Be safe, okay?\" Tuner offered a mock salute and then hurried out the door. Doc floated after him. \"Well, at least he's not walking into a trap this time,\" said Rogan, watching Tuner dart from shadowy cover to shadowy cover. \"Probably.\" \"He'll be all right,\" said Jack, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Now come and show me how to free our ship.\" * * * Tuner and Doc made it across the hangar floor without being noticed. The door to the Confession's holding centre hissed shut behind them. The hall of the holding centre was dark and cold, though neither presented much issue to the two automata. A few bulbs dangled on wires from the ceiling high above, creating stark spotlights amongst the deep shadows. Jack's human eyes may have struggled to navigate the room, but to Tuner the darkness was as bright as a summer day and the spotlights as dark as a winter morning. Stepping (and floating) quietly, they pressed further into the hall. They passed cage after cage. Most lay empty. Scraps of clothing hung on some of their iron bars. Others had floors speckled with dirt and blood, and one was home to a single shard of bone. The hall smelled of copper and bleach, and it was quiet – much too quiet. Tuner started to think that maybe Jack had a point. If rescuing the rest of the crew proved too dangerous, maybe it was best to turn back. No. He had to be brave. Either everyone got off the ship, or none of them did. Besides, he had a plasma rifle now. He reckoned he could take on the whole Raklett army with an actual plasma rifle in his hands. He readjusted the rifle's strap on his shoulder. Even if it was a bit too big to hold properly. Something moved in a cage not far from the aisle down which Tuner and Doc were walking. They sneaked across, keeping to the gaps between cells. Even with night vision, it was hard to tell who was inside. \"11-P-53, is that you?\" The creature lunged at the bars with enough force to raise the back end of its cage an inch off the ground. Spittle sprayed across the two automata. Doc spun backwards, flailing numerous surgical appendages in defence. Teeth like scythes scraped against rusty iron. A paw the size of a dinner plate lashed out at them. \"Shh!\" Tuner backed away, casting his eyes around for guards. Surely they could hear the creature barking? \"Well we definitely won't be bringing you on board the Adeona with us…\" \"IL-8-66?\" whispered a voice from a few cages away. \"Get over here!\" Tuner sprinted over. The entire crew of the Adeona had been crammed into a cage big enough to house maybe half their number. Some of the smaller automata were held aloft by their companions. Others, such as 11-P-53, were pressed hard against the bars. \"11-P-53! You're alive! They haven't erased you yet, have they?\" \"I wouldn't have recognised you if they had, idiot. How in the galaxy did you escape?\" \"Jack saved us. He's helping Rogan free the ship as we speak.\" \"Really? Huh. And who is this?\" \"This is Doc. It's coming with us.\" \"Oh, is it now? Well none of us will be going anywhere unless you can get the keys to this blasted cage.\" Tuner stepped out of the way and the medical automata hovered in front of the cell door. There was no electronic keypad to hack – the door was locked the old fashioned way, with tumblers, bolts and a keyhole. From inside Doc's chest extended a cutting torch. A hot blue flame erupted from the end. \"Stand back, please.\" The automata inside the cage inched away from the door as best they could. Doc began cutting through the bolts. It was slow and delicate work. In the darkness of the holding centre, the resulting sparks burst out like fireworks. Tuner tapped his foot against the floor. He could have sworn he heard a door open on the far end of the hall. \"Come on…\" Yep. Footsteps. Lots of them. Guards were definitely on their way. \"Any time now…\" Doc's torch sliced through the last bolt and the door to the cage swung free. 11-P-53 was closest – it dashed out and held the door open for everyone else. \"Head towards that door,\" said Tuner, pointing towards the exit to the hangar. \"Quickly as you can!\" 11-P-53 turned to Tuner as the last automata left the cage. \"Be honest. How's the hangar looking? Is the coast clear?\" \"Absolutely not. We'll be shot to pieces.\" 11-P-53 contemplated this. \"Well. There are worse things to die for than freedom, right?\" A plasma bolt exploded against the side of the cage. 11-P-53 and Tuner jumped. Three Rakletts stood snarling at the far end of the hall, each with a rifle aimed in their direction. \"Run!\" They sprinted down the row of cages towards the rest of the automata. The rifle around Tuner's neck swung wildly from side to side with every step. Plasma bolts shot past on their left and right, ricocheting off cells and blowing up light fixtures. The beast in the cage started to roar again. \"Go through the door!\" yelled Tuner. Everyone was crowded around it, waiting. \"Don't wait, just go!\" \"It's locked,\" said Kansas, wheeling out from between the legs of the other automata. \"What?\" Tuner stopped beside them and ducked as another bolt from the Rakletts buried itself in the wall above. \"What do you mean, it's locked?\" \"It won't open,\" said another robot, frantically tapping at the panel beside the door. \"The guards must have shut us in.\" \"How long would it take you to hack it?\" asked 11-P-53, pulling Tuner into cover. \"Longer than it would take for those guards to round us all up,\" replied Tuner, looking around. \"Hey. Where's Doc?\" Brackitt poked his head out from behind one of the cages. \"That medical automata you brought with you?\" He pointed towards the wall to the far left of the door. \"Isn't that it, over there?\" Tuner peered across the hall. Doc appeared too preoccupied with cutting open a mesh cabinet with its torch to notice all the gunfire going on around it. \"What does that bolt-head think it's doing?\" asked 11-P-53. Doc finished cutting through the cabinet's lock. It threw the twin doors aside. Inside were rifles. Lots of rifles. Tuner and 11-P-53 looked at each other. \"You have got to be joking,\" said 11-P-53. \"Well, you wanted freedom,\" said Tuner, shrugging. \"Fight for it.\" * * * Jack and Rogan waited until they saw Tuner and Doc sneak through the door to the holding centre before making their own move. The Rakletts were stretched too thin (and on top of that, too stupid) to notice two strangers dart from cover to cover at the back of the hangar. Jack and Rogan had to hide behind a stack of engine parts while two guards marched past – one of them stopped to suspiciously sniff the air, then caught up with his partner – but otherwise their sprint to the Adeona went without incident. The ship perked up as they ducked into cover beside her. The metal chains holding her to the floor creaked and groaned as she fired off a couple of air thrusters. \"It's good to see you too,\" said Jack, reaching up to pat the side of her landing gear. \"Stay still. We don't want to attract attention.\" Rogan tapped at the keypad of the computer terminal beside the Adeona's bay. She turned to Jack and nodded. \"I can get the chains off her from here,\" she said, ducking back down, \"but it won't be quiet. The guards will notice.\" Jack took a deep breath and weighed the rifle in his hands. \"Well, they're going to notice sooner or later. But maybe we should wait until the rest of the crew get here first?\" They peered around the terminal. From where they hid, the door on the opposite end of the hangar was little more than a black speck. \"How do you think Tuner's doing in there?\" asked Rogan, tapping her foot. \"Maybe we should have gone with him.\" \"I'm sure he's fine. If something had gone wrong, I'm sure we'd know about it.\" A bellowing alarm rang out. Red emergency lights started flashing on the walls. \"Yes, I'm sure we would.\" She punched Jack on the arm and went to stand up. \"If Tuner's—\" \"Wait,\" said Jack, pulling her back down. \"What is that?\" The door through which Tuner and Doc had entered remained closed. But a door far to the right of the holding centre had slid open, and from inside hissed a thick cloud of grey-white smoke. Loud bangs could be heard down the corridor beyond. All the Rakletts in the hangar edged forwards, their rifles trained on the opening. Silence fell, if only for the slightest of moments. And then all hell broke loose. Dozens of plasma bolts shot out from inside the smoke. Some missed, burning through crates and canisters – one of the latter rocketed upwards and detonated against the hangar ceiling, showering everyone with red-hot shrapnel. Others tore holes through the Raklett guards lying in wait. Those left alive made a hasty retreat back towards the nearest pieces of cover. The automata came out screaming. Those with arms carried plasma rifles. Those without, and those too small to wield anything bigger than a pocket knife, sprinted towards the Adeona. Tuner, Brackitt and 11-P-53 led the charge, firing wildly upon the spacecraft and fuel drums the remaining Rakletts had taken cover behind. \"Get those chains off the ship,\" said Jack, shaking Rogan out of her stupor. \"Hurry!\" Rogan stood up and pressed a single key on the terminal. The chains unlocked from one another and retracted into pits in the bay floor with a great rattling sound. The Adeona rose up, flexing her air vents and igniting her secondary thrusters. \"Watch the fuel tankers!\" yelled Jack, wincing as her flames licked across the massive bronze drums behind. The first of the fleeing automata rushed into cover beside them. The Rakletts were returning fire now, their plasma bolts scorching the wall behind the Adeona. Jack stood up and fired a couple of shots back in their direction. Tuner slid over to the terminal just as Jack was ducking down again. \"You made it,\" said Rogan, giving him a hug. \"What the hell happened to playing it safe?\" asked Jack. \"We had to fight our way out.\" Tuner leaned to the side of the terminal and fired off a couple of shots. \"There was no other way. I've killed three guards already!\" \"That's horrible!\" Rogan gave Tuner a stern look. \"They started it,\" grumbled Tuner. \"Hey, Adeona.\" Jack struggled to raise his voice above the gunfire. \"Lower your loading ramp! We need to get everyone inside.\" The ship turned on the spot, her landing gear spitting sparks as it scraped against the hangar floor. She bumped into a small shuttle parked in the bay beside her, and it toppled over. Her loading ramp began to descend. \"Everybody on board!\" shouted Jack, firing off a few more shots. \"Hurry!\" The Adeona positioned herself so that she stood between the unarmed automata and the Rakletts, blocking their line of sight. A few of the guards fired on her hull, but her shields – though weaker than those of any gunship – soaked up most of the damage. Rogan began shepherding all the automata without guns into the ship. Jack and Tuner pushed past the Adeona to a stack of crates behind which 11-P-53 was crouched. \"How's it going?\" asked Jack, out of breath. \"Are we winning?\" \"Take a look for yourself,\" replied 11-P-53, nodding towards the battlefield in front. Doc had hung back from the rest of the automata, preferring to take a more… guerrilla approach. It sped from Raklett to Raklett, spinning its saws and slashing its scalpels and igniting its cutting torches like a deranged Swiss-army knife. Furry body parts went flying. Its chassis was painted with blood. \"Good grief. I'm sure glad that thing's on our side.\" \"Doesn't matter,\" sighed 11-P-53. \"We've got a much bigger problem than a dozen guards to deal with.\" Jack's blood turned cold. \"We do?\" \"You see the forcefield over the hangar entrance?\" Jack nodded. It was hard to ignore, given the chilling vacuum of space lurking on the other side. \"Look to the right. What do you think they are?\" Sticking out from the wall on the other side of the Confession's forcefield were two pairs of long, angry-looking cannons, each twice the size of even the largest anti-aircraft gun back on Earth. They swivelled in unison. \"Ah.\" \"It's hardly surprising,\" 11-P-53 continued. The crates beside them shook from another wayward plasma bolt. \"We are on a Class-S Raklett battlecruiser, after all. More guards will be on their way down, but those guns are the real threat.\" \"How do we shut them off?\" asked Jack. \"Shut what off?\" asked Rogan, joining them. They all pointed at the cannons. \"Ah, bolts! Tuner, do you think you could override them?\" Tuner shrugged. \"If I can get onto their system, maybe.\" \"Give me a second.\" Rogan sprinted back to the terminal beside the Adeona's bay. She punched a frustrated hole through its screen a moment later. \"Good news, then?\" said Jack, flinching. \"The Confession's defence systems are kept completely separate from the rest of the ship's subroutines. There's no way to access it from here.\" \"But you found out where we can access it, yes?\" She lowered her eyes. \"The main security terminal… on the bridge.\" Everyone went quiet. \"So that's it, then,\" said Tuner, letting his rifle sag. \"It's over.\" \"Hey.\" 11-P-53 tapped him on the arm. \"Better to die fighting for freedom than live as a mindless drone, right?\" More silence. Jack knew he ought to say something, but he didn't know what. \"Everyone else is on board the Adeona,\" said Rogan, sighing. \"We can leave as soon as you give the order.\" \"We won't make it more than a hundred metres before the Confession blows us into dust,\" said 11-P-53, continuing to lay down fire against the few remaining Rakletts. \"The rest of the crew don't know that,\" she said, laying a hand on his shoulder. \"Let them believe a little longer, while there's still hope in their hearts.\" Jack looked to his left. A number of automata stood at the top of the Adeona's loading ramp, waiting. Anxious lights flashed around the top of Kansas' tiny cylindrical head. Knowing what he did, Jack had to turn his head away. Sod it. He was never getting home anyway. \"I don't suppose you saw how to get to the bridge, did you?\" Rogan shot him a quizzical look. \"What?\" \"I said, how do I get to the bridge?\" \"There's an elevator at the end of that corridor there,\" she said, pointing to a door on their right. \"Should take you straight up. But—\" \"But nothing. If we set off without disabling those cannons, we're all dead. But if I can get up there and shut them down somehow—\" \"You'll never make it back in time…\" \"—if there's even a chance, then it's worth a shot. Come on. What have you got to lose?\" \"You, Jack.\" Tuner sidled over. \"We'll lose you.\" Jack waved Tuner's worry away. \"That's not much of a price,\" he said, trying to smile. \"The world thinks I'm dead anyway.\" \"Jack…\" said Rogan. \"You punch out the second you see those guns go down,\" he said, talking straight to 11-P-53. \"Do not wait around for me, you hear?\" 11-P-53 nodded slowly, as if in shock. \"I hear,\" it said. \"Good.\" Jack gritted his teeth and squeezed his rifle tight. \"Now give me covering fire in three… two… one…\" He wasn't even sure he could run. His legs were shaking and his throat had clenched so tight it hurt to breathe. Yet he did. He ran for that door without so much as a glance at anything else… not the guards who undoubtedly shot at him, nor the friends he left behind.",

      "title": "Gaskan Troi",
      "content": "23 Gaskan Troi Jack raced down the length of the bright, white, hexagonal corridor, glancing over his shoulder at the industrial dark-grey door which had slammed shut behind him. The wailing of the sirens became muted. Softer, distant – the way an alarm clock sounds when one first wakes from a thick dream. The sharp screech of lasers and deep grumble of plasma explosions were reduced to nothing more than vibrations in the floor. Vents along the ceiling let out frigid air in an endless sigh. It kissed the sweat on the back of Jack's neck as he passed. He shivered but focussed only on making it to the elevator. If he stopped to think about what he was doing, he feared he might not start running again. The scar on his chest burned. The calves in his legs felt like lead. His brain screamed with the worst stress headache of his life. None of that mattered. The elevator doors were white too, which Jack discovered when he near enough ran into them. He spun around, clutching his rifle and looking for guards, cameras, drones – anything that might stand in his way. He found nothing. Suspicious, he pressed the lone button beside the curved elevator doors. They slid aside without a sound to reveal a small, cylindrical chamber. Its panels were similarly white and well-lit, though the floor was the colour of red wine. Another lone button waited for him on the left-hand wall. He stepped inside, pressed it with a trembling finger, and prepared for the worst. The doors closed. Other than that, nothing happened. The floor didn't drop away. Gas didn't pump into the chamber. Nails didn't shoot out from the walls like some futuristic iron maiden. Jack couldn't even tell if the elevator was moving. There was no rumble of motors, no whistling whine of cables, no sensation in his stomach of rising or falling. He could have been launched out of the Confession for all he knew, sent on a collision course with Ceros' sun. He wiped fresh sweat from his eyes and tried to control his breathing. Was it a trap? No, it couldn't be. Gaskan had no way of knowing he was on his way up to the bridge. And why would Gaskan make it easier for him if he did, anyway? No – it had to be complacency. Or an oversight, or something. Nobody expected anyone to head deeper into the ship during an escape attempt, that's all. Any and all remaining guards must have been redeployed to the hangar. Still, it all seemed too easy. It would have almost been more reassuring if people had been shooting at him – at least in a firefight he had a decent idea of what the other side were trying to do. The elevator arrived at its destination. There was no indication that it had slowed down, nor any pleasant jingle to mark the end of the journey. The doors simply slid apart again. If they'd opened up on the same white corridor he'd come down, Jack wouldn't have been surprised. Instead, he found himself standing at the rear of an enormous command centre. Many magnitudes greater in size than that of the Adeona, it was the sort of bridge one would expect to find on a battlecruiser. Dozens of expensive-looking computer terminals in sunken rows to the left and right of a grand central walkway; giant video screens showing star maps and ship data in real-time; a viewing window perhaps twenty-five metres in diameter, offering a breathtaking panorama of the Ceros system. Standing in front of the window with its back to the command centre was Gaskan’s tall, gaunt silhouette. Steeling his nerves and tightening his grip on his rifle, Jack marched down the walkway… …and immediately came face-to-face with the security he had expected to find down on the other end of the elevator shaft. Jack had no idea what they were, but they sure weren't Rakletts. They wore sleek obsidian armour that covered every inch of their slim, seven-and-a-half foot frames. Their helmets were flat and featureless – not unlike the one Jack had seen Charon wearing in his video message. Each carried a silver circular throwing blade that flashed blue in the Ceros starlight. Gaskan's personal guard, perhaps. The black-clad guards said nothing, only stared at him. Then they swung their arms back in unison, preparing to throw their weapons. Jack dived behind the partition nearest the elevator just as the two circular blades whizzed past the spot where his head had been a millisecond before. He took it all back. Being shot at wasn't more reassuring at all. The blades carved deep gashes in the wall beside the elevator and clattered to the floor. Jack watched them shake on the spot and then rocket back into the hands of Gaskan's guards. They must have had some sort of magnetic instrument inside their armoured gloves. Jack didn't wait for them to follow him around the partition wall. There was another opening to the bridge a few metres further down – he sprinted the distance and then leapt into the sunken pit beyond. He landed behind one of the computer consoles and winced as a circular saw cut through the air an inch above it. It was on a collision course with the viewing window. Jack grabbed the computer and held his breath. But the blade never made it that far. It slowed to a stop in mid-air and then was yanked back towards its owner as if attached by an invisible bungee rope. Jack took his chance. He popped up from behind the computer and shot two bolts at the guard to whom the blade was returning. She was too focussed on the flight of her weapon to dodge out of the way. The first of Jack's bolts exploded against her torso roughly where a human's ribcage would be. The rifle’s recoil threw off Jack's aim. The second bolt hit the guard closer to her shoulder, but it was still enough to throw her backwards off the walkway. By the time Jack noticed the second blade, it was almost too late. He ducked back into cover but not before it sliced through the fabric of his left sleeve. The blade didn't even slow down. Jack grabbed at the flapping tear in his suit. The damage looked purely cosmetic, but it was hard to tell. Shock could be quelling the pain. A cut that thin might not even bleed for a few seconds. He could still move his arm, so for the moment he guessed it didn't matter. He popped back up, ready to do the same to this guard as he had the last… and then remembered that she hadn't called her circular blade back yet. Jack rolled to the side a nanosecond before the returning weapon could take a few inches off the top of his head. He went to take another shot. But once again the guard was too quick – the blade whistled as it narrowly missed the top of the computer terminal, then sprayed out waves of sparks as it skimmed across it on the way back. He was trapped, exhausted, unable to stand up long enough to aim let alone fire off a plasma bolt. And he was still no closer to shutting down the Confession's exterior cannons so that the Adeona could escape. \"What sort of idiot thinks he can single-handedly commandeer the bridge of a battlecruiser?\" Jack whispered to himself, clenching his jaw. One who expects to die anyway, he realised. He lunged towards the next computer terminal along. He'd hoped to surprise the guard by flanking her, but it didn't work. She almost took his foot off as he scrambled back into cover. For crying out loud. He didn't have time for this. Still the blade kept coming, screeching like a buzzsaw as it lacerated the computer protecting him, each time slowing to a hovering stop a few feet above his head before boomeranging back into the guard's hand. Jack hunkered down even further. A thick, rubbery cable ran out from the back of the computer in front of him and coiled itself into a messy pile by his feet. Jack kicked it aside to make more room for himself, then froze. He had an idea. It wasn't a good one, but it would have to do. He gave the cable a hard yank, pulling its fat plug free from the computer. The machine died with a short, sad whine. He unravelled the cable until it had just the right amount of slack, then stamped his foot down on the other end. Hopefully he had enough weight to hold it. The blade still flashed above his head, then disappeared – flashed, then disappeared. She was toying with him. She thought this was a sport. Well, he'd show her. Or him. Or whatever the alien was. He had no way of knowing when the blade would appear above his head again, but he could count how long it stayed there. From when it first burst into view to the moment it reversed its direction, he had maybe a second to act. Three times he watched it carve through the air above his head. On its fourth pass he threw the cable. The head of the plug looped twice around the circular blade's central handle. As the guard used her glove to call it back, Jack stood up, putting all of his weight on the other end of the cable. The cable ran out of slack and the blade jerked to a stop in mid-air, tethered halfway between the two of them. Jack lost his balance, but not before firing a single shot at the perplexed guard. It was enough. He might not have dealt the killing blow, but she was still stunned when Jack's foot lifted off the cable. The blade whipped back at blistering speed, severing her hand above the glove and slicing through half of her torso before crashing into the consoles on the other side of the room. She had already collapsed into a bloody heap on the walkway floor by the time Jack regained his balance. He lowered his rifle and took a moment to catch his breath. The sight of her spidery dismembered hand made him want to throw up. Then, with wide-eyed panic, he remembered who else was still in the room with him. Jack couldn't turn fast enough. The gunshot rang out and he tumbled backwards, landing only inches from the second guard's corpse… not to mention the dark pool of blood spreading from the gash in her side. He blinked his eyes, confused. He didn't feel dead. A frantic inspection of his spacesuit showed no damage for which either the bounty hunter or elite guards couldn't claim responsibility. Then he noticed the smoke billowing from a jagged hole in the rifle he still had clutched in one hand. He gave the trigger a couple of cursory pulls, then tossed it aside when nothing happened. He sighed and then stood up, his hands raised in the air. \"Very good,\" said Gaskan, standing at the other end of the walkway. He had a pistol pointed at Jack. \"An impressive display. To best a Luethian bounty hunter is one thing, but two Sisters of Camulus…\" He nodded sagely. \"Did you know that after taking their vows, they dedicate their whole adult lives to mastering a single weapon?\" \"I did not.\" Despite himself, Jack felt a small swell of pride. Gaskan bobbed his head from side to side. \"These two were young, and clearly didn't study hard enough. Still, impressive. You should come work for us. Under my master's tutorage, you could cause some real damage.\" Jack scoffed. \"Why on Earth would I want to work for Charon after all this?\" Gaskan's skull-face grinned. The hair on the back of Jack's neck stood on end. \"Who said anything about working for Charon?\" Jack shivered. The air in the bridge suddenly felt a whole lot colder. \"You'd heard of Earth before,\" he said, taking a step forward. Gaskan raised a hand, and he stopped. \"How?\" \"Join us and I'll tell you everything I know.\" It scared Jack how much he wanted to say yes. \"Let the automata go free and maybe I'll consider it.\" Gaskan barked a single dry laugh. \"Not happening. They worked on one of the projects. We can't risk them telling anybody what they saw.\" \"This Iris thing I keep hearing about?\" He shook his head. \"They won't tell anybody—\" \"They told you.\" Jack cleared his throat and prepared himself for what he knew was coming next. \"That's the deal. I came here to save them. I won't leave here by selling them out.\" Gaskan sneered. \"So shortsighted,\" he said, aiming his pistol at Jack's head. \"Just another lesser species after all.\" There was a much louder bang than Jack anticipated. Gaskan flew backwards towards the viewing window, blood spraying from his tattered robes. His gun went clattering across the metal floor. Jack spun around. Rogan and Tuner were stood in the elevator doorway, each with a plasma rifle in hand. Rogan's looked the more freshly used. \"What the bloody hell are you doing here?\" yelled Jack. \"I thought I told you to wait by the ship for the cannons to go offline!\" \"We figured you could use the help.\" Rogan marched into the bridge. \"You're welcome, by the way.\" \"And let's be honest – you're pretty crap with computers.\" Tuner hurried over but stopped short when he saw the dismembered guard. \"Wait, did you do that?\" Jack nodded, embarrassed. \"Oh, that is badass!\" Rogan rolled her eyes. \"Which one is the security terminal, Tuner?\" Tuner pointed at the console Jack had been hiding behind. The screens and keyboards had been smashed to pieces by the throwing blades. Its power cable lay torn to ribbons far on the other side of the room. \"Ah,\" said Jack. \"Doesn't matter,\" said Tuner, rushing over to a floor panel at the end of the walkway. He prised it open with a grunt. \"I should be able to access everything on the bridge through here anyway. Give me a minute.\" Rogan stood by the window, checking Gaskan's body. Jack joined her, bending down to pick up Gaskan's pistol on his way. \"How's it going down in the hangar?\" he asked, stuffing the gun into the compartment on his spacesuit trousers. \"It's getting tight.\" Rogan gave Gaskan's corpse a kick. \"The Rakletts' rifles haven't got through the Adeona's shields yet, but we can't hold them off forever. There hadn't been any fatalities when we left. Brackitt lost an arm, but he seems to be taking it pretty well.\" Jack's nerves got the better of him. He let out a laugh by accident and had to pretend to be coughing. \"Well it's only an arm, I suppose.\" \"And it's done,\" said Tuner, letting the panel slam shut. \"The cannons are offline. We, erm… we might want to be extra quick getting out of here, though.\" The look Rogan gave Tuner was sharp enough to crack Ceros-VI in half all over again. \"What did you do this time?\" \"Well, you know how a ship this size has to run off a central fusion reactor?\" Tuner bowed his head and pretended to inspect a spot of rust on his foot. \"I may have pushed it a little past the recommended limits. We probably have about two minutes before it blows.\" \"I'm sorry, what? Why in the galaxy did you do that?\" \"The failsafes were right there – what else was I supposed to do? Do you want these guys following us after we leave?\" Jack's heel jackhammered the floor in terror. \"Sorry, do you think we could have this discussion on the Adeona instead?\" The three of them sprinted to the open elevator doors. Jack was almost inside when a monitor at the back of the hall stopped him dead. The screen displayed schematics of some kind. Jack wondered if they were the same blueprints retrieved from Tuner's head. Photorealistic graphics showed a colossal ring, thousands of kilometres in diameter. It made Jack think of a giant iron snake devouring its own tail. He shook his head clear. Whatever the pictures on Gaskan's computer showed, there wasn't time to waste thinking about them. Jack squeezed into the cramped elevator cabin alongside Rogan and Tuner. They were lucky it still worked – the throwing blades had cut an ugly gash through one of its doors. Going down was a much less comfortable ride than going up. The battlecruiser's reactor engine had already started to break apart. \"Maybe I should have set a delay,\" said Tuner. Rogan crossed her arms. \"You think?\" The elevator doors slid aside at the bottom. They wasted no time getting to the end of the corridor. The doors to the hangar were infuriatingly slow to open. A lot of dead Rakletts waited for them on the other side. Jack stepped through first, frantically checking the bays. \"Where's the Adeona?\" He turned back to Rogan and Tuner. \"Did they leave without us?\" A deafening roar erupted overhead. They looked up with delight as the Adeona descended from a holding position above their heads. The rest of their crew, plus a blood-soaked Doc, stood at the top of the open loading ramp. \"The Adeona—\" 11-P-53 struggled to make itself heard over the ship's thrusters. It shook its head. \"Some reinforcements got up onto the balcony. She had to roast them before you got back. Get in!\" The lip of the loading ramp hovered only a couple of feet off the ground. Jack and Rogan helped Tuner get on first, then climbed up. By the time they reached the rest of the crew at the top, the ramp was closed and the Adeona had turned herself back around. Jack sagged against the hull and caught his breath. He pointed a tired finger at 11-P-53. \"I remember telling you to get out of here as soon as the cannons were down.\" \"One, I don't take orders from a fleshy. And two,\" it said, patting Jack on the shoulder, \"nobody gets left behind. Come on up to the cockpit. It's time we got out of here.\" As Jack followed 11-P-53 up the stairs, he felt the Adeona drift forward. Clearly she didn't need any of them to tell her where to go: anywhere but inside the Confession. The windows in the cockpit showed only empty space. For the first time, Jack found the view strangely comforting. Nobody was chasing them. Nothing was blocking their way. \"Show the rear video feed!\" said Tuner, hopping up and down. Rogan raised an eyebrow. \"What?\" he said, shrugging. \"We may as well see our handiwork.\" 11-P-53 sat in the captain's chair and pressed a single button. The view changed to show the Confession sitting on the edge of Ceros-VI's orbit. The picture continued to magnify itself the further the Adeona drew away. For a moment nothing happened. Then the video feed grew bright with a brief, orange light, which dissipated as quickly as it appeared. It left behind a ship as shattered as the planet around which it orbited. The broken pieces tumbled and burned up as they plummeted through Ceros-VI's thin atmosphere. The automata crowding around the cockpit cheered. Jack collapsed into one of the empty chairs and smiled. \"I will admit, that was satisfying,\" said Rogan, cracking a wry smile. 11-P-53 switched the video feed off. \"Okay. Fun's over. Has the ship still got enough Somnium left to make the last jump?\" Brackitt nodded. \"Only the one, mind. She's depleted the last of her regular fuel, so we'll be adrift once we reach the other side.\" \"We can worry about that later. Do we have a course set?\" Rogan summoned an image of the planet Detri from the hologram table. \"I've plotted out the optimal route,\" she replied. \"Ready when you are.\" 11-P-53 spun its chair around and prepared to activate the skip drive. \"All right, then. Let's go home.\"",

      "content": "23 Gaskan Troi Jack raced down the length of the bright, white, hexagonal corridor, glancing over his shoulder at the industrial dark-grey door which had slammed shut behind him. The wailing of the sirens became muted. Softer, distant – the way an alarm clock sounds when one first wakes from a thick dream. The sharp screech of lasers and deep grumble of plasma explosions were reduced to nothing more than vibrations in the floor. Vents along the ceiling let out frigid air in an endless sigh. It kissed the sweat on the back of Jack's neck as he passed. He shivered but focussed only on making it to the elevator. If he stopped to think about what he was doing, he feared he might not start running again. The scar on his chest burned. The calves in his legs felt like lead. His brain screamed with the worst stress headache of his life. None of that mattered. The elevator doors were white too, which Jack discovered when he near enough ran into them. He spun around, clutching his rifle and looking for guards, cameras, drones – anything that might stand in his way. He found nothing. Suspicious, he pressed the lone button beside the curved elevator doors. They slid aside without a sound to reveal a small, cylindrical chamber. Its panels were similarly white and well-lit, though the floor was the colour of red wine. Another lone button waited for him on the left-hand wall. He stepped inside, pressed it with a trembling finger, and prepared for the worst. The doors closed. Other than that, nothing happened. The floor didn't drop away. Gas didn't pump into the chamber. Nails didn't shoot out from the walls like some futuristic iron maiden. Jack couldn't even tell if the elevator was moving. There was no rumble of motors, no whistling whine of cables, no sensation in his stomach of rising or falling. He could have been launched out of the Confession for all he knew, sent on a collision course with Ceros' sun. He wiped fresh sweat from his eyes and tried to control his breathing. Was it a trap? No, it couldn't be. Gaskan had no way of knowing he was on his way up to the bridge. And why would Gaskan make it easier for him if he did, anyway? No – it had to be complacency. Or an oversight, or something. Nobody expected anyone to head deeper into the ship during an escape attempt, that's all. Any and all remaining guards must have been redeployed to the hangar. Still, it all seemed too easy. It would have almost been more reassuring if people had been shooting at him – at least in a firefight he had a decent idea of what the other side were trying to do. The elevator arrived at its destination. There was no indication that it had slowed down, nor any pleasant jingle to mark the end of the journey. The doors simply slid apart again. If they'd opened up on the same white corridor he'd come down, Jack wouldn't have been surprised. Instead, he found himself standing at the rear of an enormous command centre. Many magnitudes greater in size than that of the Adeona, it was the sort of bridge one would expect to find on a battlecruiser. Dozens of expensive-looking computer terminals in sunken rows to the left and right of a grand central walkway; giant video screens showing star maps and ship data in real-time; a viewing window perhaps twenty-five metres in diameter, offering a breathtaking panorama of the Ceros system. Standing in front of the window with its back to the command centre was Gaskan’s tall, gaunt silhouette. Steeling his nerves and tightening his grip on his rifle, Jack marched down the walkway… …and immediately came face-to-face with the security he had expected to find down on the other end of the elevator shaft. Jack had no idea what they were, but they sure weren't Rakletts. They wore sleek obsidian armour that covered every inch of their slim, seven-and-a-half foot frames. Their helmets were flat and featureless – not unlike the one Jack had seen Charon wearing in his video message. Each carried a silver circular throwing blade that flashed blue in the Ceros starlight. Gaskan's personal guard, perhaps. The black-clad guards said nothing, only stared at him. Then they swung their arms back in unison, preparing to throw their weapons. Jack dived behind the partition nearest the elevator just as the two circular blades whizzed past the spot where his head had been a millisecond before. He took it all back. Being shot at wasn't more reassuring at all. The blades carved deep gashes in the wall beside the elevator and clattered to the floor. Jack watched them shake on the spot and then rocket back into the hands of Gaskan's guards. They must have had some sort of magnetic instrument inside their armoured gloves. Jack didn't wait for them to follow him around the partition wall. There was another opening to the bridge a few metres further down – he sprinted the distance and then leapt into the sunken pit beyond. He landed behind one of the computer consoles and winced as a circular saw cut through the air an inch above it. It was on a collision course with the viewing window. Jack grabbed the computer and held his breath. But the blade never made it that far. It slowed to a stop in mid-air and then was yanked back towards its owner as if attached by an invisible bungee rope. Jack took his chance. He popped up from behind the computer and shot two bolts at the guard to whom the blade was returning. She was too focussed on the flight of her weapon to dodge out of the way. The first of Jack's bolts exploded against her torso roughly where a human's ribcage would be. The rifle’s recoil threw off Jack's aim. The second bolt hit the guard closer to her shoulder, but it was still enough to throw her backwards off the walkway. By the time Jack noticed the second blade, it was almost too late. He ducked back into cover but not before it sliced through the fabric of his left sleeve. The blade didn't even slow down. Jack grabbed at the flapping tear in his suit. The damage looked purely cosmetic, but it was hard to tell. Shock could be quelling the pain. A cut that thin might not even bleed for a few seconds. He could still move his arm, so for the moment he guessed it didn't matter. He popped back up, ready to do the same to this guard as he had the last… and then remembered that she hadn't called her circular blade back yet. Jack rolled to the side a nanosecond before the returning weapon could take a few inches off the top of his head. He went to take another shot. But once again the guard was too quick – the blade whistled as it narrowly missed the top of the computer terminal, then sprayed out waves of sparks as it skimmed across it on the way back. He was trapped, exhausted, unable to stand up long enough to aim let alone fire off a plasma bolt. And he was still no closer to shutting down the Confession's exterior cannons so that the Adeona could escape. \"What sort of idiot thinks he can single-handedly commandeer the bridge of a battlecruiser?\" Jack whispered to himself, clenching his jaw. One who expects to die anyway, he realised. He lunged towards the next computer terminal along. He'd hoped to surprise the guard by flanking her, but it didn't work. She almost took his foot off as he scrambled back into cover. For crying out loud. He didn't have time for this. Still the blade kept coming, screeching like a buzzsaw as it lacerated the computer protecting him, each time slowing to a hovering stop a few feet above his head before boomeranging back into the guard's hand. Jack hunkered down even further. A thick, rubbery cable ran out from the back of the computer in front of him and coiled itself into a messy pile by his feet. Jack kicked it aside to make more room for himself, then froze. He had an idea. It wasn't a good one, but it would have to do. He gave the cable a hard yank, pulling its fat plug free from the computer. The machine died with a short, sad whine. He unravelled the cable until it had just the right amount of slack, then stamped his foot down on the other end. Hopefully he had enough weight to hold it. The blade still flashed above his head, then disappeared – flashed, then disappeared. She was toying with him. She thought this was a sport. Well, he'd show her. Or him. Or whatever the alien was. He had no way of knowing when the blade would appear above his head again, but he could count how long it stayed there. From when it first burst into view to the moment it reversed its direction, he had maybe a second to act. Three times he watched it carve through the air above his head. On its fourth pass he threw the cable. The head of the plug looped twice around the circular blade's central handle. As the guard used her glove to call it back, Jack stood up, putting all of his weight on the other end of the cable. The cable ran out of slack and the blade jerked to a stop in mid-air, tethered halfway between the two of them. Jack lost his balance, but not before firing a single shot at the perplexed guard. It was enough. He might not have dealt the killing blow, but she was still stunned when Jack's foot lifted off the cable. The blade whipped back at blistering speed, severing her hand above the glove and slicing through half of her torso before crashing into the consoles on the other side of the room. She had already collapsed into a bloody heap on the walkway floor by the time Jack regained his balance. He lowered his rifle and took a moment to catch his breath. The sight of her spidery dismembered hand made him want to throw up. Then, with wide-eyed panic, he remembered who else was still in the room with him. Jack couldn't turn fast enough. The gunshot rang out and he tumbled backwards, landing only inches from the second guard's corpse… not to mention the dark pool of blood spreading from the gash in her side. He blinked his eyes, confused. He didn't feel dead. A frantic inspection of his spacesuit showed no damage for which either the bounty hunter or elite guards couldn't claim responsibility. Then he noticed the smoke billowing from a jagged hole in the rifle he still had clutched in one hand. He gave the trigger a couple of cursory pulls, then tossed it aside when nothing happened. He sighed and then stood up, his hands raised in the air. \"Very good,\" said Gaskan, standing at the other end of the walkway. He had a pistol pointed at Jack. \"An impressive display. To best a Luethian bounty hunter is one thing, but two Sisters of Camulus…\" He nodded sagely. \"Did you know that after taking their vows, they dedicate their whole adult lives to mastering a single weapon?\" \"I did not.\" Despite himself, Jack felt a small swell of pride. Gaskan bobbed his head from side to side. \"These two were young, and clearly didn't study hard enough. Still, impressive. You should come work for us. Under my master's tutorage, you could cause some real damage.\" Jack scoffed. \"Why on Earth would I want to work for Charon after all this?\" Gaskan's skull-face grinned. The hair on the back of Jack's neck stood on end. \"Who said anything about working for Charon?\" Jack shivered. The air in the bridge suddenly felt a whole lot colder. \"You'd heard of Earth before,\" he said, taking a step forward. Gaskan raised a hand, and he stopped. \"How?\" \"Join us and I'll tell you everything I know.\" It scared Jack how much he wanted to say yes. \"Let the automata go free and maybe I'll consider it.\" Gaskan barked a single dry laugh. \"Not happening. They worked on one of the projects. We can't risk them telling anybody what they saw.\" \"This Iris thing I keep hearing about?\" He shook his head. \"They won't tell anybody—\" \"They told you.\" Jack cleared his throat and prepared himself for what he knew was coming next. \"That's the deal. I came here to save them.

Gaskan flew backwards towards the viewing window, blood spraying from his tattered robes. His gun went clattering across the metal floor. Jack spun around. Rogan and Tuner were stood in the elevator doorway, each with a plasma rifle in hand. Rogan's looked the more freshly used. \"What the bloody hell are you doing here?\" yelled Jack. \"I thought I told you to wait by the ship for the cannons to go offline!\" \"We figured you could use the help.\" Rogan marched into the bridge. \"You're welcome, by the way.\" \"And let's be honest – you're pretty crap with computers.\" Tuner hurried over but stopped short when he saw the dismembered guard. \"Wait, did you do that?\" Jack nodded, embarrassed. \"Oh, that is badass!\" Rogan rolled her eyes. \"Which one is the security terminal, Tuner?\" Tuner pointed at the console Jack had been hiding behind.

      "content": "24 Detri They broke out of subspace a few days' ride from Detri. The Adeona exhausted the last remaining dregs of her thruster fuel and then they floated the rest of the way, adrift. Jack rationed what little food he could eat from the pantry. Unlike the automata, he wasn't convinced that Rogan's coordinates would lead them anywhere at all. Her maps were thousands of years out of date. And even if they did find their fabled planet, it wouldn't be anything more than a lifeless rock. They wouldn't find anyone there. Not that rationing would do much but delay the inevitable, if that were the case. A million miles from the nearest ship, trillions from the nearest star system… nobody would come and get them. A greater concern than food was the lack of water aboard the ship. Tuner had suggested building a device to recycle the ship's artificial atmosphere into something drinkable, but in the long term that created a whole other set of problems. In the meantime, he had to hope the juices from the fruits would do. None of the automata shared these problems. They didn't even seem bothered by the boredom, some electing to go into standby mode until they reached their destination. Being left alone with his thoughts did little to elevate Jack's mood. He didn't only miss Amber, though of course she occupied his mind most of all, particularly right before slipping off to sleep. He missed the sounds and smells of their home. He missed the bland, mushy, government-issued rations given out at the end of each working week. Hell, he almost missed the work itself. But everything that had come before the first solar flare – that's what he truly missed. Picnics in the park. Trips to the theatre. Sundays on which to do nothing, because doing nothing was enough. Optimism. Hopes and dreams. A sense that tomorrow might be better than today. He supposed much of that had been lost long before he found himself flung across the universe. * * * \"There it is,\" said 11-P-53, on their third day without fuel. \"Eighteen degrees starboard – see it?\" Jack rose from his seat, his stomach rolling and his muscles groaning. The endless night sky was awash with stars – some bright and lonely, others in great, sweeping bands of distant galaxies. But one did look a fraction bigger than the others, and a duller, matte shade of grey. Despite his doubts, Jack's heart fluttered. \"Detri? You found it?\" \"Right where Rogan said it would be,\" said Tuner, his LED eyes bright with awe. Rogan smiled. \"I only typed in the coordinates and factored in universal expansion,\" she said, raising a sarcastic eyebrow in Jack's direction. \"The stories told us where to go.\" \"All right, all right…\" Over the five or six hours that followed, Detri grew from a grey speck to the size of the Moon when viewed from Earth. Nobody left the cockpit the whole time. Jack recalled the conversation he had with Rogan back at the Library on Kapamentis. The automata cities were inside the planet, not on its surface. Even so, he couldn't help but be overcome with hopeless disappointment when he saw no satellites, no superstructures, no pinpricks of light pollution from bustling metropolises below. It was a dead and dusty planet without a star, and nothing more. This would be his grave. \"We might have a problem.\" Brackitt spun around in his chair. \"The Adeona doesn't have a way to slow down.\" \"I'm sorry, what?\" Jack sat up in his chair. \"Doesn't she have any air brakes, or something?\" \"Yes, but this isn't like driving a land vehicle, Jack,\" said Rogan. \"There's no air resistance in space. No friction. Even without thrusters, we're travelling towards Detri at an insane velocity. The only way for the Adeona to slow herself down is to fire thrusters in the opposite direction—\" \"But she doesn't have any fuel left,\" said Tuner. \"We can change her direction to some degree with the air thrusters,\" said 11-P-53. \"It won't be enough to bring us to a stop, but it'll give us some options.\" \"And those options are…?\" \"Crashing into the planet, or using its gravitational pull to slingshot ourselves past it,\" said Brackitt. Jack buried his head in his hands. \"Good grief.\" Detri now dominated the view from the windows, growing larger with each passing second. Jack could clearly see the craters and canyons upon its pockmarked surface. A planet this far out, away from the protection of larger solar bodies, surely fell regular victim to meteoric bombardment. \"I assume everyone would prefer the latter?\" asked Brackitt, waiting for an answer. \"Yes!\" Before 11-P-53 and Brackitt could turn the ship, Tuner pushed his way to the front. He pointed at the planet. \"Wait! What are those blue things?\" Everybody looked up. Two bright blue lights approached the Adeona, blinking in a slow and relaxing pattern. Each light belonged to a drone about the size of a family car. At the speed it was travelling, the Adeona should have shot right past them. Instead the two drones changed course to match the ship's velocity, travelling alongside it towards the planet and washing the length of her hull with scan after scan after scan. \"What are they doing?\" asked Jack, standing up. Nobody had an answer. The drones switched from scanning the ship to spotlighting it with something far brighter and, somehow, denser… almost as if they were tethering themselves to the Adeona with a pair of visible magnetic fields. \"They're slowing us down,\" said Brackitt. \"I think they're bringing us in to land.\" \"Land where?\" 11-P-53 waved a hysterical hand at the empty plains of Detri before them. \"All I see is a bunch of craters!\" True enough, the two drones appeared to be leading the ship towards one of the smallest impact sites, the diameter of which was perhaps only a few miles across. The chance to slingshot past Detri now gone, they had no choice but to surrender control and follow their shepherds down. The problem was, even though the drones' speed – and therefore that of the Adeona – had dropped considerably, they showed no signs of stopping. \"Do something!\" hissed 11-P-53. Flustered, Brackitt raised his one remaining hand. \"I can't!\" The barren surface of the planet grew closer, until there was nothing left to see outside the windows but the fast approaching floor of the crater. 11-P-53 turned and screamed at everyone in the cockpit. \"Brace for impact!\" But no sooner had Jack wrapped his arms around his head than the crater began to split down its middle. They watched as the two halves grunted apart to reveal titanic cogs and gears turning inside, providing ample space through which both the Adeona and the drones could pass. And as they drifted into the belly of the planet, through the thin waterfalls of dust shaken loose from the surface and the glittering forcefield that lay beyond, it all became suddenly clear. \"The sanctuary is real,\" said Rogan, pressing her hands against the windows. If she'd had tear ducts, Jack reckoned she would have cried. Before them stretched a great mechanical city, miles wide and dozens of tiers deep, like the caps of metal mushrooms overlapping one another in their struggle for light. Not that there wasn't plenty of space to go around. Construction was underway on every outskirt. Troll-shaped diggers ploughed through the rocky mantle, and cranes lowered towering steel blocks into the resulting foundations. Giant industrial pipes fed the resulting smoke and dust away from the city and towards the planet's surface. The streets and pavilions were teeming with liberated robots. There had to have been millions of them. Everybody cheered, even 11-P-53. Jack cracked a grin and laughed. For all his doubts, the stories had been true. After everything they'd been through, the automata were finally home. And his chances of dying forgotten and alone on some crummy pit of a planet had dropped considerably. That helped lift Jack's spirits, too. \"Hey, Tuner,\" he said, tapping the little automata on the arm. \"Congratulations.\" \"We did it!\" Tuner could hardly keep himself from jumping up and down. \"We're finally free!\" The drones brought the Adeona on a slow descent, past a residential outcrop and towards an open, elevated podium that reminded Jack of the top of an aircraft carrier. Dozens of armoured ships the size of frigates were parked at terminals around the edge, while scores of smaller spacecraft came and went from landing pads and bays. Jack wondered how many of the ships inside Detri were as sentient as the Adeona. Most if not all, he reckoned. That got him thinking about everything else he could see outside the window – did the structures the automata built have minds of their own as well? Did the city? The drones hovered in place and lowered the Adeona onto an empty landing pad towards the front of the open-air hangar. She released her landing equipment and touched down even more delicately than she could have managed alone. The instant the Adeona made contact, the two drones relinquished their light-magnetic hold on her and sped off back in the direction of the crater door. Below the cockpit, the loading ramp sighed open. Nobody moved. \"Should we… should we leave?\" asked Rogan. Tuner tried and failed to peer over the dashboard at the hangar below. \"I guess so.\" \"Wait a moment.\" Jack's eyes grew wide and he clutched at his throat. \"What's the atmosphere here like? Is there even an atmosphere at all?\" Brackitt raised his one good hand. \"Jack—\" \"Because why would an automata world need one, right? It wouldn't, would it? But my suit can't protect me from a vacuum anymore. I mean, look at it.\" He pointed at the patch on his chest plate, the tear on his arm, and his complete lack of helmet. \"I'll die the second I leave this ship.\" \"You'll be fine, Jack,\" said Brackitt, laying his hand on Jack's shoulder. \"There's air here, probably to regulate heat. It's thin, but breathable. Let us know if you start feeling too light-headed.\" \"Oh, okay.\" Jack nodded erratically. \"Sure.\" Tuner reached up and grabbed his hand. \"Don't worry. You'll be okay if you stick with me.\" \"I'm just a bit exhausted, that's all,\" replied Jack… yet he kept hold of Tuner's hand the whole way down to the loading ramp all the same. The automata streamed out into the sanctuary. Jack stood by himself at the top, watching them go. They all seemed so happy, so excited, so… full of hope. It was a nice thing to witness. He took a deep breath – as deep as Detri's low levels of oxygen would allow, at any rate – and followed the rest of them down the ramp. \"Another day, another planet,\" he mumbled to himself. He caught up with the crowd just as another group of automata, seven in number, approached from the hangar's entrance. At their front marched an old hunk of junk that appeared to be held together as much by sheer determination as it was by bolts and duct tape. Antennae stuck out at bent angles and it walked on four spider-legs, none of which seemed to belong to the original model. The technology looked ancient, as if a Victorian had designed it. If somebody had told Jack it ran on punch cards and cassette ribbons, he would have believed them. Two identical robots the size of bulldozers rumbled alongside their decrepit leader on tank treads. Each of their arms looked like a jet turbine. The faint pulse of plasma energy glowed inside. Jack had no doubt that a single shot from one of them would leave him as nothing but a red smear across the hangar floor. A sudden wooziness came over him. Rogan stuck out her arm and grabbed Jack before he had a chance to fall. He put his weight on her, which she accepted gladly. \"Welcome to Detri.\" The scrappy robot at the front peered at them all with a single eye like the lens of a Super 8 camera. \"You needn't be so nervous. You're safe here. Is your ship damaged? We had trouble detecting you.\" Brackitt stepped forward. \"Some of her systems got fried by a disrupter mine, and she's suffered some nasty scrapes. On top of that, she's run out of juice. No fuel in her main tank or skip drive. We had to drift most of the way here.\" \"Sounds as if you had a hard time getting to us. And my goodness, look at your arm. Don't worry, we can fix that.\" It waved a rusty appendage in front of the crowd. \"My name is Tork, and it's my job to make sure you all get comfortable in your new home. Whatever troubles you fled from are over. Those troubles do not belong here. You are free. Nobody owns you. Nobody can tell you where to go or what to do. Whatever you build is your own, and… what in the name of Detri is that?\" All of the automata turned around to face Jack, who groggily peered back at them. Brackitt spoke up again. \"Ah, that's—\" \"It is forbidden to bring fleshies to Detri! If word were to spread of the sanctuary's existence, our safety would be compromised!\" Tork pointed an angry digit at Jack. \"Remove him, LT-One.\" One of the living tanks rolled forwards. Everyone instinctively stepped out of the way – everyone save for Rogan and Tuner, who remained glued to Jack's side. The tank raised one of its plasma cannon hands and aimed it at Jack's head. The turbine began to spin. Crackles of red and purple lightning danced inside. Too tired to move, Jack merely turned his head to the side and winced at the sudden burst of heat. \"Wait!\" 11-P-53 jumped between Jack and the tank. \"You can trust him!\" \"Trust him?\" Tork scoffed. \"If fleshies could be trusted, Detri wouldn't need to exist. Stand aside.\" \"This one is different!\" Tuner stepped forward. \"We wouldn't even be here if it weren't for Jack.\" \"He risked his life to help us,\" said Rogan. \"Twice, actually.\" The tank automata hesitated. It looked around at Tork, who cautiously scuttled closer. \"Really?\" Tork addressed the crew of the Adeona. \"You're honestly telling me that this fleshy was willing to die for you all? For nothing in return?\" Everyone nodded or bleeped in agreement. A few even started forming a protective shield around Jack. Tork hesitated, studying Jack with his one analogue eye before he spoke again. \"Then I suppose our kind owes you a debt of gratitude.\" He came within inches of Jack's face. \"Can we trust you, Jack?\" Jack nodded. His head felt terribly heavy. \"I've got nowhere else to go,\" he said, \"and nobody else to tell.\" \"Then I suppose you'd better stay here,\" said Tork, pulling away. \"For now, at least. Come along, everyone. Let me show you around.\" Jack let out a sigh of relief. He went to follow Tork only for his legs to give out from under him. He collapsed onto the cold, hard floor with a loud smack. \"Jack?\" Tuner hurried back. \"Jack? Are you okay?\" \"What's wrong with him?\" asked Tork. \"He needs food and water,\" said Rogan, kneeling down. She rolled him onto his back. \"And oxygen. The air here is much too thin for him.\" \"I think we pulled some cured proteins from a renegade ship seeking amnesty not too long ago.\" Tork gesticulated towards one of his companions. \"Go to Salvaged Goods and bring back anything edible you can find. And you,\" he added, pointing to another robot, \"head to the old steam engines and collect some water.\" \"We'll need to filter it.\" Rogan lifted Jack's head onto her lap. \"What about air?\" Tuner's head perked up. \"There's still a little oxygen in the Adeona's air thrusters,\" he said. \"I can extract some into a canister and then feed that into Jack's helmet, if I plug up the cracks. It'll be ugly, but it'll work.\" \"Good idea.\" Jack tried to take as deep a breath as possible, but it made no difference. He didn't have the strength. His head felt fuzzy and everything sounded like it was coming from the next room over. \"Come on, Jack. Stay with me.\" Rogan stroked the hair out of his eyes. \"You've come this far. Don't be an idiot and die on me now.\" Jack wanted to laugh. Everything went black before he could.",

      "content": "24 Detri They broke out of subspace a few days' ride from Detri. The Adeona exhausted the last remaining dregs of her thruster fuel and then they floated the rest of the way, adrift. Jack rationed what little food he could eat from the pantry. Unlike the automata, he wasn't convinced that Rogan's coordinates would lead them anywhere at all. Her maps were thousands of years out of date. And even if they did find their fabled planet, it wouldn't be anything more than a lifeless rock. They wouldn't find anyone there. Not that rationing would do much but delay the inevitable, if that were the case. A million miles from the nearest ship, trillions from the nearest star system… nobody would come and get them. A greater concern than food was the lack of water aboard the ship. Tuner had suggested building a device to recycle the ship's artificial atmosphere into something drinkable, but in the long term that created a whole other set of problems. In the meantime, he had to hope the juices from the fruits would do. None of the automata shared these problems. They didn't even seem bothered by the boredom, some electing to go into standby mode until they reached their destination. Being left alone with his thoughts did little to elevate Jack's mood. He didn't only miss Amber, though of course she occupied his mind most of all, particularly right before slipping off to sleep. He missed the sounds and smells of their home. He missed the bland, mushy, government-issued rations given out at the end of each working week. Hell, he almost missed the work itself. But everything that had come before the first solar flare – that's what he truly missed. Picnics in the park. Trips to the theatre. Sundays on which to do nothing, because doing nothing was enough. Optimism. Hopes and dreams. A sense that tomorrow might be better than today. He supposed much of that had been lost long before he found himself flung across the universe. * * * \"There it is,\" said 11-P-53, on their third day without fuel. \"Eighteen degrees starboard – see it?\" Jack rose from his seat, his stomach rolling and his muscles groaning. The endless night sky was awash with stars – some bright and lonely, others in great, sweeping bands of distant galaxies. But one did look a fraction bigger than the others, and a duller, matte shade of grey. Despite his doubts, Jack's heart fluttered. \"Detri? You found it?\" \"Right where Rogan said it would be,\" said Tuner, his LED eyes bright with awe. Rogan smiled. \"I only typed in the coordinates and factored in universal expansion,\" she said, raising a sarcastic eyebrow in Jack's direction. \"The stories told us where to go.\" \"All right, all right…\" Over the five or six hours that followed, Detri grew from a grey speck to the size of the Moon when viewed from Earth. Nobody left the cockpit the whole time. Jack recalled the conversation he had with Rogan back at the Library on Kapamentis. The automata cities were inside the planet, not on its surface. Even so, he couldn't help but be overcome with hopeless disappointment when he saw no satellites, no superstructures, no pinpricks of light pollution from bustling metropolises below. It was a dead and dusty planet without a star, and nothing more. This would be his grave. \"We might have a problem.\" Brackitt spun around in his chair. \"The Adeona doesn't have a way to slow down.\" \"I'm sorry, what?\" Jack sat up in his chair. \"Doesn't she have any air brakes, or something?\" \"Yes, but this isn't like driving a land vehicle, Jack,\" said Rogan. \"There's no air resistance in space. No friction. Even without thrusters, we're travelling towards Detri at an insane velocity. The only way for the Adeona to slow herself down is to fire thrusters in the opposite direction—\" \"But she doesn't have any fuel left,\" said Tuner. \"We can change her direction to some degree with the air thrusters,\" said 11-P-53. \"It won't be enough to bring us to a stop, but it'll give us some options.\" \"And those options are…?\" \"Crashing into the planet, or using its gravitational pull to slingshot ourselves past it,\" said Brackitt. Jack buried his head in his hands. \"Good grief.\" Detri now dominated the view from the windows, growing larger with each passing second. Jack could clearly see the craters and canyons upon its pockmarked surface. A planet this far out, away from the protection of larger solar bodies, surely fell regular victim to meteoric bombardment. \"I assume everyone would prefer the latter?\" asked Brackitt, waiting for an answer. \"Yes!\" Before 11-P-53 and Brackitt could turn the ship, Tuner pushed his way to the front. He pointed at the planet. \"Wait! What are those blue things?\" Everybody looked up. Two bright blue lights approached the Adeona, blinking in a slow and relaxing pattern. Each light belonged to a drone about the size of a family car. At the speed it was travelling, the Adeona should have shot right past them.

      "title": "New Horizons",
      "content": "25 New Horizons Great sentient excavators chewed through the rocky earth, building a world from the ruins of a dead one. Ground was broken. Through the resulting cracks grew homes. Jack stood at the top of a cliff on the outskirts of Detri's lone city, overlooking the construction. He liked being out there. Despite the noise of the digging machines, it somehow seemed quieter. Perhaps he was getting too accustomed to being alone. Four days had passed since the Adeona's admittance into Detri. For a while, few of the automata knew what to do with their newfound freedom. They huddled together in their temporary accommodation, only daring to venture outside if 11-P-53 or Tork gave the order. But one by one they mustered the courage to set out on their own, or in pairs, and explore their new community. Rogan and Tuner had no such trouble settling in. Rogan frequented their archives every chance she could – adding as much to their data banks as she learned from them, probably – while Tuner couldn't keep away from the city's core engine rooms. Brackitt volunteered to work at the hangar as soon as he got out from having his arm replaced. Jack was happy for them. Truly. For the first time in their lives, they were free. But he wasn't free. Not really. He felt the same way everyone on Earth had, back when it was first announced their planet had a best-before date and there weren't enough tickets off-world to go around. He felt trapped, for want of a better word. Trapped on Detri. Trapped in a damn spacesuit. Not that he wasn't grateful for the latter – it was pretty much the only thing keeping him alive. Using his old, broken helmet as a makeshift oxygen mask had done the job, but it had only ever been a temporary solution. While Jack slowly recovered in a hastily constructed isolation chamber, Tuner had plundered from Detri's not insubstantial supply warehouses the rare resources for a new and improved spacesuit. And boy, had the little guy added all the trimmings. For one, it was a lot sleeker than the previous model. Tuner had based its design on the scans Doc took of Jack aboard the Confession. It had a matte black, carbon-fibre appearance. Despite the flexibility of the material, Tuner was adamant it could stop most slugs and plasma bolts. Jack hoped he wouldn't get a chance to put that to the test. The interior was comfortably snug, able to regulate his body heat in case of extreme highs and lows in temperature, and cushioned to absorb the impacts from high falls or heavy projectiles. Most importantly, given his present circumstances, it had a functioning helmet. The transparent front was scratch-proof – Tuner had originally intended to install a miniature forcefield over the front of the helmet, but opted for a more practical solution having considered the disastrous consequences of a system failure during a spacewalk – and automatically darkened when exposed to bright lights. It also sported a miniature version of the artificial atmosphere device on board the Adeona, which made it capable of producing its own clean air not quite indefinitely, but for far longer than Jack intended to be away from a viable source of oxygen ever again. \"Ah. We thought we'd find you out here.\" Rogan and Tuner approached Jack from behind. Rogan had buffed out some of her scratches and dents, and both looked as if they'd had a good polish since the last time he'd seen them. \"Just watching these guys work,\" he said, gesturing towards the construction crew. \"It's really impressive how coordinated they all are. Amazing stuff.\" He pretended not to notice the concerned glance Rogan and Tuner shared with each other. \"How are you holding up, Jack?\" asked Tuner. \"Oh, not bad. Feeling a lot better. This suit is an absolute dream, by the way.\" Rogan stood beside him. \"Homesick?\" Jack went to say something, then only sighed instead. There was no point in keeping up the facade any longer. Not with them. \"I can't stay here, guys,\" he said, shrugging. \"I don't belong here. I can't even breathe the air.\" \"Yes—\" \"It's been at least a week since I left Earth,\" Jack continued, cutting Rogan off, \"and I'm still no closer to finding my way back home. Amber surely thinks I'm dead by now. She must be going out of her mind.\" \"We hear you.\" Rogan took his hand. \"We understand. Come with us. There's something we want you to see.\" The two automata led Jack on a long and winding walk through the city. Jack didn't mind. It wasn't as if he had anything better to do with his time. Eventually they arrived outside a large workshop with a retractable roof. The twin doors at the front were wide open. Brackitt came wandering out, wiping his hands on an oily rag. \"Hey! I was wondering when you lot were going to show up. You're looking healthy, Jack.\" \"Thanks. How's the arm?\" \"Better than ever. Double-jointed, too.\" He turned to Rogan and nodded towards the doors. \"You ready to show him?\" \"Show me what?\" asked Jack. Tuner hopped from one foot to the other, as if he were desperate for an oil change. \"Oh, this is very exciting!\" They ushered him inside the workshop, smirking the whole time. It was pitch black inside. Brackitt flicked a switch on the wall, and all around them strips of light came spluttering to life. Jack's mouth dropped open. Before him stood the Adeona, but she was a far different Adeona to the one he'd flown before. Her battered, copper-coloured hull had been replaced – or possibly reinforced – with pristine plates of dark silver armour. Her rear thrusters had been repaired and upgraded. But Jack was most surprised by the turrets mounted on her sides. They looked like massive Gatling guns. \"She looks amazing!\" He pointed at the cannons. \"Where the hell did you find those?\" \"One of the ships in the hangar is ex-military.\" Brackitt admired his handiwork. \"They reminded her of sadder times, and she wanted rid of them. Adeona was happy to take them off her hands, so to speak.\" \"I bet she was.\" Jack put his hands on his hips and whistled. \"I don't expect she'll get much chance to use them, but they look great.\" \"Oh, I don't know about that.\" 11-P-53 walked in behind them. \"If her journey back is anything like as bad as the way here, she might need to fire off a round or two.\" \"Journey back?\" Jack looked around at everyone. \"Is she leaving?\" \"Yes,\" said Rogan. \"With you.\" \"What?\" \"I spoke about it at length with Tork,\" said 11-P-53. \"He's agreed for you to go, providing you never tell anybody about this place. He's being serious. If you ever breathe a word about Detri, you're going to find a bounty on your head.\" \"Of course.\" Jack gawped, struggling to find the words. \"But are you sure you're okay with this? Isn't the Adeona your ship?\" 11-P-53 shook its head. \"She's not anyone's ship but her own.\" It stuck out its hand. \"But for all intents and purposes, she's yours now. While she'll have you.\" Jack shook it. \"Thanks, 11-P-53. I really mean it.\" \"Ah, call me Captain,\" said 11-P-53, waving the name away. \"Not that I have a ship anymore…\" Jack stared up at the Adeona. His own ship. He never thought he'd see the day. \"I barely know how to fly her,\" he said, suppressing a hysterical laugh. \"And I've no way of knowing where I'm going…\" \"That's why we're going with you.\" Jack spun around. Rogan and Tuner stood side by side, beaming. Well, Rogan did. Jack had to guess Tuner's mood from his excited fidgeting. \"But you only just got here!\" \"True, and Detri is wonderful.\" Rogan shrugged. \"But we just got a taste of freedom for the very first time. The safety and security of the sanctuary might be what some automata are after, but it's not the right fit for us. Not yet. There's a whole universe out there to explore. Now that we're free, we want to see it.\" \"You helped us find our home,\" said Tuner. \"It's only fair that we help you find yours in return.\" \"Be honest. You're hoping for another firefight, aren't you?\" Tuner shrugged sheepishly. \"I mean, if we happen to run into anybody unsavoury…\" Brackitt clapped his hands together and nodded towards the loading ramp. \"So, do you want to see inside?\" \"You mean there's more you want to show me?\" Brackitt laughed. \"Oh, just you wait.\" \"I'll leave you to it,\" said 11-P-53, heading back to the doors. \"Take care, Jack. I hope you find what you're looking for.\" Jack waved goodbye and then followed the others up. He could see the difference as soon as he reached the top of the ramp. Everything inside the Adeona had been scrubbed down, all traces of rust removed. Damaged parts had been replaced with new ones. She looked less like a steampunk submarine and more like, well, a proper spaceship. \"We've upgraded her engines, but I won't bore you with the details,\" said Brackitt, pointing down the corridor towards the rear of the ship. \"Just know that both the main combustion engine and the skip drive have vastly increased capacity and should burn more efficiently than before.\" \"That means no more drifting for days without power,\" whispered Tuner. \"Thanks, Tuner. I got that.\" \"No more limiting our jumps to old subspace routes, either,\" said Rogan, crossing her arms. \"We could get halfway across the galaxy without making a single stop, if we wanted.\" \"We made some functional and cosmetic changes to the quarters and washrooms too, but I'll let you discover them for yourself.\" Brackitt gestured for everyone to follow him up to the cockpit. \"Come on up. This is the best bit.\" They went upstairs. At a glance, everything looked the same. Swept, scrubbed and polished, but otherwise identical to how Jack had seen it last. \"Notice anything different?\" asked Brackitt. Jack searched for something out of place. Had the computer terminals been upgraded? It wasn't as if he'd ever used them. He thought that maybe the seats up front had been replaced, but they were the same as well. Then he noticed them – small, circular speakers in the walls and ceiling. \"Nice. You put a sound system in. That'll come in handy for the long flights.\" Tuner laughed. Rogan groaned and covered her face with her hand. \"Perhaps you should go ahead and introduce yourself,\" said Brackitt. \"Hello, Jack Bishop,\" said a bright voice from inside the speakers. \"It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Well. Speak to you, at least.\" Jack jerked his head around. \"Er… what's happening?\" \"The Adeona has always had a voice,\" said Brackitt. \"It's about time somebody heard it other than me.\" \"Incredible.\" Jack approached the captain's chair at the front. \"It's a pleasure to meet you too.\" \"Go ahead,\" said Brackitt, noticing Jack's hesitation. Jack sat down. The chair felt different this time – not because any part of it had been swapped out, and not because its strange fabric adapted to the contours of his body any differently than before. Rather, it was because he fitted the chair better. For the first time in a long while, he felt as if he'd found his place. He smiled. It was a good feeling. \"Where do you want to go, handsome?\" the Adeona asked. \"Earth. But I don't know how to get there yet.\" Tuner leaned against the railings behind him. \"Well, where do you want to start looking?\" Jack strapped himself in and took a deep breath. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day – one day he'd make it home. He shrugged. \"I guess we'd better start with everywhere.\" * * * Thank you for reading!

      "content": "25 New Horizons Great sentient excavators chewed through the rocky earth, building a world from the ruins of a dead one. Ground was broken. Through the resulting cracks grew homes. Jack stood at the top of a cliff on the outskirts of Detri's lone city, overlooking the construction. He liked being out there. Despite the noise of the digging machines, it somehow seemed quieter. Perhaps he was getting too accustomed to being alone. Four days had passed since the Adeona's admittance into Detri. For a while, few of the automata knew what to do with their newfound freedom. They huddled together in their temporary accommodation, only daring to venture outside if 11-P-53 or Tork gave the order. But one by one they mustered the courage to set out on their own, or in pairs, and explore their new community. Rogan and Tuner had no such trouble settling in. Rogan frequented their archives every chance she could – adding as much to their data banks as she learned from them, probably – while Tuner couldn't keep away from the city's core engine rooms. Brackitt volunteered to work at the hangar as soon as he got out from having his arm replaced. Jack was happy for them. Truly. For the first time in their lives, they were free. But he wasn't free. Not really. He felt the same way everyone on Earth had, back when it was first announced their planet had a best-before date and there weren't enough tickets off-world to go around. He felt trapped, for want of a better word. Trapped on Detri. Trapped in a damn spacesuit. Not that he wasn't grateful for the latter – it was pretty much the only thing keeping him alive. Using his old, broken helmet as a makeshift oxygen mask had done the job, but it had only ever been a temporary solution. While Jack slowly recovered in a hastily constructed isolation chamber, Tuner had plundered from Detri's not insubstantial supply warehouses the rare resources for a new and improved spacesuit. And boy, had the little guy added all the trimmings. For one, it was a lot sleeker than the previous model. Tuner had based its design on the scans Doc took of Jack aboard the Confession. It had a matte black, carbon-fibre appearance. Despite the flexibility of the material, Tuner was adamant it could stop most slugs and plasma bolts. Jack hoped he wouldn't get a chance to put that to the test. The interior was comfortably snug, able to regulate his body heat in case of extreme highs and lows in temperature, and cushioned to absorb the impacts from high falls or heavy projectiles. Most importantly, given his present circumstances, it had a functioning helmet. The transparent front was scratch-proof – Tuner had originally intended to install a miniature forcefield over the front of the helmet, but opted for a more practical solution having considered the disastrous consequences of a system failure during a spacewalk – and automatically darkened when exposed to bright lights. It also sported a miniature version of the artificial atmosphere device on board the Adeona, which made it capable of producing its own clean air not quite indefinitely, but for far longer than Jack intended to be away from a viable source of oxygen ever again. \"Ah. We thought we'd find you out here.\" Rogan and Tuner approached Jack from behind. Rogan had buffed out some of her scratches and dents, and both looked as if they'd had a good polish since the last time he'd seen them. \"Just watching these guys work,\" he said, gesturing towards the construction crew. \"It's really impressive how coordinated they all are. Amazing stuff.\" He pretended not to notice the concerned glance Rogan and Tuner shared with each other. \"How are you holding up, Jack?\" asked Tuner. \"Oh, not bad. Feeling a lot better. This suit is an absolute dream, by the way.\" Rogan stood beside him. \"Homesick?\" Jack went to say something, then only sighed instead. There was no point in keeping up the facade any longer. Not with them. \"I can't stay here, guys,\" he said, shrugging. \"I don't belong here. I can't even breathe the air.\" \"Yes—\" \"It's been at least a week since I left Earth,\" Jack continued, cutting Rogan off, \"and I'm still no closer to finding my way back home. Amber surely thinks I'm dead by now. She must be going out of her mind.\" \"We hear you.\" Rogan took his hand. \"We understand. Come with us. There's something we want you to see.\" The two automata led Jack on a long and winding walk through the city. Jack didn't mind. It wasn't as if he had anything better to do with his time.

Her battered, copper-coloured hull had been replaced – or possibly reinforced – with pristine plates of dark silver armour. Her rear thrusters had been repaired and upgraded.

They looked like massive Gatling guns. \"She looks amazing!\" He pointed at the cannons. \"Where the hell did you find those?\" \"One of the ships in the hangar is ex-military.\" Brackitt admired his handiwork. \"They reminded her of sadder times, and she wanted rid of them.
