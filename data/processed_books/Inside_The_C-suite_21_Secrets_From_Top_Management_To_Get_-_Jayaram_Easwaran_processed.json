      "content": "Preface In a career spanning three decades, working in the corporate sector and as a consultant, I have addressed thousands at engineering colleges and business management institutes and at other corporate forums. One question I’m often asked is, ‘What does it take to reach the top and stay there?’ Be it the fancy MBA graduate in a hurry to get to the top or the patient, hardworking manager slogging at the job for years or the usual sycophant who flatters his way up the corporate ladder, the C-Suite is the ultimate aspirational destination for everyone. To all of them the C-Suite is that hallowed office reserved for those whose designations start with the letter ‘C’, with titles that read chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer, chief people officer, chief technology officer and so on. My answers often comprised the usual ingredients: quality education, the right experience and the requisite expertise. I knew that there was more but was unable to get a full grip on what these really were. And then one day, I happened to see Martin Scorsese’s 1986 movie The Color of Money. There is a scene in which Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) tells Vincent (Tom Cruise) ‘I’ll tell you something, kiddo. You couldn’t find the big time if you had a road map. You got to be a student of human moves. See, all the greats that I know of were students of human moves.’ It suddenly struck me – how well this applied to the business world too. One had to be a student of human moves! Reaching the top and staying there is all about one’s ability to successfully navigate the undercurrents prevalent in the rarified environs of the C-Suite. It is how you sense and manage the egos, the politics, the insecurities, the hidden agendas and motivations of people and teams at the top. That’s not to say that such issues do not exist at lower levels. It’s just that at higher levels, egos are more fragile and insecurity is at its peak. I recall two events that exemplify this. The first one occurred in the year 2010. I was at the Atlantis in Dubai, having breakfast with a friend who happened to be the chief operating officer of an international bank. The global banking industry had just been through a major crisis. ‘Hope your job is safe?’ I asked him. ‘So far, so good,’ he said. And continued, ‘You know, at my level I will never lose my job because of incompetence. But yes, I could be thrown out tomorrow if I do not manage egos and insecurities amongst my colleagues at the top.’ The other event happened in New Delhi in 1998. One of our divisional heads walked into my room and placed on my desk the minutes of the last review meeting. He pointed to the first line that listed the names of all attendees. ‘Looks like the internal pecking order has changed again. Do you think there is a message for me? Earlier, I was at number three. Now I am at eleven.’ I had no answer. I was aware that our CEO always hand- wrote the minutes in order to reduce any transcription errors. That evening I decided to speak with the CEO. ‘Oh my god! Are our senior folk so insecure? I just write down the names in the order in which they sit around the table during the meeting,’ he said. From then on, all names in the minutes appeared in alphabetical order. I have worked at leadership levels across the globe in technology and brick-and-mortar companies and I believe the best way for anyone to understand what happens at higher levels in any company is to pick up a job as the executive assistant (EA) to the CEO and be the fly-on-the-wall in their office. But such opportunities are far and few in between, and I hope this book, of twenty-one short episodes, which are fictionalized accounts of real incidents over the course of my career, will provide you a ringside view of the C-Suite and what goes on in there. Each story has an embedded message that addresses the most pertinent issues of our work lives. Stories about the dilemma of being virtuous when the stakes are high, the pitfalls of judging a book by its cover, the dangers of blind ambition, ego squabbles among top brass that can damage a firm beyond repair, and many others. The stories are mostly drawn from a variety of Indian and trans-national companies, where, I can say with a certain degree of confidence, egos, insecurities, craving for visibility, survival strategies such as cover-your-ass (CYA) techniques, boot-licking, coteries, back-stabbing and chicanery are universal traits and are industry and culture agnostic. That does not mean that positive traits and qualities do not exist. They do and in great measure! But as is often said, when a dog bites a man it is staid news. And when a man bites a dog… Ah! That is different! This book attempts to take you on a journey that will help you understand the trials, tribulations, fun and pain that make life at the top so fascinating. It does not matter whether you are a student, a middle-or senior-level executive, or even someone occupying the C-Suite. By the time you finish reading this book, you will, hopefully, be wiser, smarter and better equipped to navigate and deal with the challenges that come your way and help you get ahead in business and in life. Every story needs a protagonist, an antagonist and a plot where conflicts arise and get resolved. I have tried to provide these in equal measure. I have attempted to keep the language simple, taking a cue from what William Faulkner is purported to have said about Ernest Hemingway: ‘He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary.’ The chapters can be read in no particular order, as every story is complete in itself. This is not the outcome of any kind of behavioural research and not meant to impart any gyaan. All I have done is picked up certain insights gained over years of observation and created short stories from these and I trust that the reader will find her/his own themes and lessons in these. Before you begin, permit me to leave you with a thought: In every organized set-up there are four kinds of people: The insecure ones, who often compete with their subordinates. The political beings, forever competing with their superiors. The mature folk who compete with their peers. And lastly, the true leaders who compete with themselves. Ask yourself, which category you currently belong to. And I hope that the insights gained from reading my stories help you decide where you want to be!",

      "content": "1 His Father’s Son Ten years ago, Param’s father retired from the Indian Army as a colonel. Param’s early memories of his home in Pune, while his father was still in service, were quite mixed. Two older brothers, his parents and two dogs lived in a spacious, red-tiled bungalow on a two-acre plot in the cantonment area. While life was comfortable, money was always in short supply. When new shoes were bought for the boys, they would always be a size or two larger. Cotton stuffing was used to make them fit and the boys had to literally grow into their shoes. As kids, they would avoid their father if they could. Not only was he a strict disciplinarian, with him it was always a case of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’. As a consequence, Param and his brothers spent most of their time at Major Krishnan’s place, not far from where they lived. The boys never understood why the Major admired their father so much, and they really did not care so long as he and his wife were kind to them. Param’s brothers joined the National Defence Academy at Khadakwasla immediately after completing school and eventually became commissioned army officers. Param was the only one still at home around the time his father retired. As they shifted from their large bungalow to a small, rented two-bedroom house, the reality of their life hit him. The government had provided virtually all of the furniture and fittings in the previous house. Whatever belonged to the family easily fitted into a few large wooden crates – that too provided by the army. That day, Param promised himself that in the days to come, his first priority would be to ensure complete financial security for himself. No matter what the circumstances, he would never allow himself to get to the kind of situation that his parents were in. Param moved on to complete his post-graduation from a prestigious management school and took up a lucrative job with a leading multinational company in Delhi. Every time he went home to meet his parents, he felt for them, especially for his mother. On one such occasion, he spoke to his father while they were having the morning tea. ‘Dad, you know I have a large, four-bedroom flat in Delhi. It’s too large for just my wife, our six-year-old son and me,’ said Param. His father looked up from the newspaper, ‘Then why don’t you move in to a smaller place. You will save some money too.’ To a neutral observer it would appear as if his father was being sarcastic. But Param knew that his father was quite a simple person and meant it in good faith. ‘I was wondering if Mom and you could move in with us, it would be beneficial to all of us.’ ‘Don’t worry. We will keep visiting once in a while,’ said his father. ‘No, no … That’s not what I meant, Dad. I would like you to come and stay with us permanently. This is the least I can do for all that you have done for us.’ ‘Param, what I did was my duty. I am sure tomorrow you will do the same for your son and wife. And don’t worry, this house and my pension are good enough for your mother and me,’ said his father and turned his attention back to the newspaper. Param was getting frustrated. He had hit a brick wall again. Why was his father always so self-righteous and refusing to see things from his point of view? He got up and walked over to the other room where his mother was ironing clothes. ‘Did you hear what he said, Mom?’ ‘Yes, I heard him. Did you expect a different response from him?’ she asked, carrying on with her chores. ‘Well, it’s been ten years since his retirement and I expected that by now he would get down from his high horse and face reality. You are staying in a rented place and the landlord can ask you to vacate any moment. And it’s not going to be easy for a retired person to rent another place so soon.’ ‘You know your father is a self-made man and has his own principles. And he would want his children to also have the same principles.’ ‘What principles are you speaking of, Mom? Something that denied us the smallest of things in life while our friends in the neighbourhood enjoyed the best of toys and gadgets? Are you talking of those principles that have denied him the capacity to even buy a house of his own after so many years of service? I want to have nothing to do with those principles.’ ‘I feel so sad that you just don’t understand these things.’ ‘I am happy this way, so let us be,’ said Param realizing that he had hit a wall with his mother too. Param left for Delhi the next day and continued to make frequent visits to Pune but never raised that topic again. A few years later, he joined a mid-sized company as the CEO. His salary virtually doubled and he moved to a larger apartment, in Gurgaon. As he sat in his spacious twelfth-floor office, looking out through the large French windows, his thoughts went back to how he would make one more effort to get his parents to come and stay with him. Param’s reverie was broken by a soft knock on his door. His secretary came in to drop off a file. It was his proposal to the company board about acquiring a company in Mumbai. This acquisition would make theirs the largest company in the market research outsourcing space. Once this was achieved, they could easily attract a major strategic investor from abroad. The board approved his proposal and gave him the mandate to initiate discussions. Once the due diligence process was complete, it was time for Param to travel to Mumbai to meet the chairman and founder of the company they wished to acquire. They met at a prominent hotel in Juhu. Param noticed how small his own hand was when they shook hands. The founder looked much taller and older than in his photos. He sported a small ponytail and his well-trimmed beard was more salt than pepper. The cleft on his chin was visible in spite of the beard. After exchanging pleasantries, Param got straight to the point. ‘By now, you would be aware of what your company is worth,’ he said. ‘I think I have a fair idea, Param. May I call you that? ‘Sure, sir,’ said Param, deferring to the other person’s age. ‘Why don’t you give me a number?’ ‘I’ve done the math and our best offer is two hundred crores,’ said Param. The man sitting in front of him shook his head slightly, leaned forward and lowered his voice. ‘Param, I want you to listen carefully. What I am going to say next must not go out of this room. I hope you understand?’ Param was not prepared for this. What was this man up to? ‘You have my word,’ he said. ‘Let me put it this way. You raise the offer to two hundred and forty crores and twenty crores of that is yours. That’s a lot of money, you know. And this price will only enhance the valuation of our merged entities.’ Param could hear his heart thumping loud. After thinking for a while, he stood up, extended his hand, and said, ‘I will try selling that to my board tomorrow.’ The next day he met the board members and apprised them of the new developments. He spoke to them as to why at even the new valuations it made sense to go through the acquisition. Some members asked a few questions and were satisfied with Param’s responses. And as he’d expected, the board cleared the new numbers. As an elated Param sat in his office contemplating his next move, his mother called. ‘Param, our landlord has served us notice to vacate the house. Your father is very worried, though he won’t show it.’ ‘Don’t worry, Mom. Can I speak to Dad?’ Param’s father came on to the line: ‘Yes, Param?’ ‘Mom just told me about the landlord. Dad, please do not worry. I have just concluded a major deal and will be coming into a lot of money. I’ll soon buy both of you a better house in Pune. I am thinking of Koregaon Park.’ ‘Koregaon Park?’ asked his father. ‘Isn’t that the most expensive real estate in Pune? Then you must be making a lot of money.’ ‘Yes, Dad, lots of money.’ ‘I hope all that is honest money, son.’ Param’s pent-up feelings burst out at that moment. ‘I know you will never appreciate anything I do. You seem to still hold it against me that I did not join the army. What has the army done for you? My brothers who are in the army will never, in their lifetime, be able to buy you and Mom your own house! I can and want to buy you a house and you question my integrity?’ ‘Param, the truth is, I am very proud of you and your achievements. But you are yet to answer my question. Is that honest money?’ ‘You know something, Dad? While we were kids, we had everything but money. You still live in a small, rented house. You know why? It’s because you have put yourself on top of this mountain called honesty and now you are trying to live up to that. I am a businessman, I don’t have such hang-ups.’ ‘Listen son, I brought you all up and gave you all a decent life, did I not? In my whole life, I have never done anything that has made me stoop low. And every night, I sleep with a clear conscience. I don’t want to change that. Not today, not ever!’ Param felt his rage rising. ‘I think you are honest only because you are scared of the consequences if found out.’ His father disconnected the call. Param was still seething when the phone rang again. It was his mother. ‘What did you just say to your father?’ she asked angrily. He told her of his plans to buy them a new house. ‘Listen Param, you kids will always feel that we never gave you what your friends’ parents gave them. We still did our best and gave you all a good life. At least it was the best we could do. And if all our children are doing well today, then somewhere we have contributed in a small way,’ she said, between sobs. ‘I am not denying that, Mom. But all I have wished for is to see you and Dad happy. And for him to be proud of me,’ said Param. His mother answered in a firm voice: ‘I have never seen your father this hurt. What makes you think we will be happy only if you buy us a better house? How little you know us! Never judge us till you can really put yourself in our shoes and understand our circumstances. If you really want your father to be proud of you, try and live up to his values.’ With that, she hung up. Param felt angry and helpless. He had wanted to help his parents but he felt they refused to understand him. He desperately wanted to talk to somebody, anybody, who would understand him and tell him he was not wrong. He decided to call Major Krishnan, who now lived in Chennai, after retirement. In the past he had often turned to him, a father figure, whenever he felt low or had to discuss some personal decisions. ‘Good evening, Uncle. Hope I am not disturbing you?’ said Param. ‘Nice to hear from you, Param! No, you are not disturbing me. I have all the time.’ Param then relayed the conversation with his parents and told him how even his mother had been unsympathetic. ‘What am I doing wrong? You tell me, Uncle.’ There was silence at the other end, and then he heard Major Krishnan take a deep breath. ‘Param, I want to tell you a real story concerning your father. No one other than your father and I know this. Maybe he has told your mother, but I don’t know about that.’ There was a pause. ‘While I was serving under your Dad, I lost my father, who was a teacher in Chennai. My mother and two sisters were fully dependent on me. When my sisters were to be married, I borrowed a large sum of money from some loan sharks. When these guys later pressed me to return the money, I did not have the funds. I was planning to seek help from an army contractor, something that would have been a serious breach of rules. When I mentioned this to your father, he dissuaded me saying it was unethical too. ‘Your father then sold off his small ancestral home in his village, borrowed some more from the bank, and paid off my debts. While he was still in service, he continued to pay monthly instalments to the bank. Later, when he retired from the army, he commuted part of his pension and paid the bank in full. I am yet to repay a large part of your father’s loan and not once has he reminded me. I hope you know now, why as kids you never had enough money or why your father still does not own a house!’ Major Krishnan’s voice was trembling, ‘ Your father is the most ethical person that I know!’ Param ended the conversation apologizing for not having understood his father. As he sat there mulling over his father’s story, Param came to a decision. He called the chairman and founder of the company he had plans to acquire and told him the board had not agreed to the enhanced price. The deal was off. He slept like a baby that night. At last, he felt proud of being a worthy son to his father.",

      "content": "2 The Pink Envelope It was 1.30 a.m. The flight from Chennai was an hour late. Rajeev messaged his wife, Sri: ‘Just landed. Home in 45 minutes.’ Her reply was instant. ‘Okay. I’m awake.’ He messaged her again as he entered the elevator to get to his twenty-second-floor apartment at Hiranandani Gardens, Powai. She was waiting with the front door open and they walked softly, through the long corridor towards their bedroom, so as not to wake up his mother and their daughter, Arya. ‘How was the dinner on the flight? Do you want me to get you something?’ she asked. He answered in the negative and went into the bathroom. A few minutes later, as he slipped in under the comforter, she snuggled up to him. ‘Now tell me about this job offer you mentioned on the phone.’ ‘I met Sundar during lunch at the Nasscom conclave. He runs his own software company in Chennai.’ ‘And he made you an offer just like that?’ ‘Of course not, only after he had reached the conclusion that he would never find a better HR professional than me!’ Sri smiled and nudged him with her elbow. ‘You’re lucky I wasn’t there at that lunch!’ ‘I know and, for that, I shall be eternally grateful,’ he said. Rajeev and Sri had been classmates at IIM Ahmedabad. Both had majored in HR and she had been ahead of him in class. They landed jobs in Delhi through campus placement. A telecom software company hired him while she joined a consulting firm. Two years later they married. ‘So, you said yes?’ Rajeev could sense she was not too happy. ‘Of course not! I wanted to speak with you and then get back to him.’ ‘You realize this will be our third move in ten years,’ she said. ‘Sri, the compensation is great and I would be the HR head out there. And don’t you think Amma will be happier in Chennai?’ ‘I know, Rajeev. But then this will be your fifth job. We know that every time you take on a new assignment you are enthusiastic. And invariably, when things do not pan out as expected, you quit.’ ‘Oh, come on,’ he said. ‘Tell me I am wrong? We have been through this before,’ she said. ‘Arya is now seven and will need more stability with her schooling. And if I had not become a freelance training consultant, you know how difficult all this would be for us.’ ‘Don’t worry, Sri, it will work out fine this time and I promise not to quit for at least five years,’ said Rajeev, as he pulled her towards him in a warm embrace. During the first six months in his new job, Rajeev learnt many things about the company and about Sundar. Over 90 per cent of the company’s $200-million revenues came from working for an uncle’s fast-growing IT firm in the US. Profits were good and Sundar had hired many IIT and IIM alumni. Sundar had two elder brothers who, after getting their engineering degrees abroad, went to Harvard for their MBA. One was already involved in the family business. Sundar was lovingly referred to as the black sheep of the family. After completing his BCom, he had started this company with investments from his father. As the months went by, Sri was happy to see Rajeev settle down well at his new job. Sundar often sought his opinions on matters beyond HR, and this added to his confidence. Sri too picked up a few training assignments in Chennai, which kept her busy. Approximately a year later, Sri observed that Rajeev often kept to himself and was not his usual communicative self. ‘What’s eating you, Rajeev? Hope it’s nothing about us?’ she asked. ‘Of course not, Sri!’ ‘Then you must admit that something is bothering you.’ Rajeev sighed. There was no way out now. ‘Of late, I have noticed Sundar getting very unpredictable and authoritarian. He gets irritated often and humiliates some of the senior folk in public, for no fault of theirs.’ ‘Has he done that to you too?’ ‘Not yet, but I am tense that one day he may pick on me. Honestly, I don’t know how I would deal with that.’ ‘You said that Sundar often consults you on issues beyond HR,’ Sri said. It’s obvious that he values your advice. I am sure you having nothing to fear,’ she said hoping to allay Rajeev’s fears. ‘I understand what you are saying, Sri. But I suspect that at times when Sundar shouts at a person, he is indirectly targeting someone else.’ ‘I don’t get it. What exactly are you saying?’ ‘I have seen Sundar shout at a particular function head and talk of inefficiencies of some other function. If he shouts at me, I will put in my papers.’ Sri could sense that her worst fears were about to come true. Whenever her husband was confronted with a difficult situation, he always took the easy way out and quit. She had yet to see him take a stand. ‘Are revenues down?’ she asked. ‘No, in fact, this year is predicted to be a great one.’ ‘I wonder what’s bothering Sundar then? Authoritarian behaviour, we know, is a reflection of some deep-seated insecurity. Why don’t you try and talk to someone who has been there longer than you? They may have answers,’ she said looking to identify other causes for Sundar’s behaviour. ‘I will talk with our CFO tomorrow,’ replied Rajeev. He sought some time with the CFO the next day. ‘I suspect Sundar has an inferiority complex vis-à-vis his brothers. The younger one just returned from Harvard and has also joined the family business,’ said the CFO. ‘What is the connection?’ asked Rajeev. ‘I think one way for Sundar to assert his status within the family is to have many of us from the IITs and IIMs work for him. And remember, most of his business comes from his uncle in the US. So, he really does not care how we feel or respond.’ ‘But why humiliate people this way?’ ‘It’s his style not to directly confront some of us. He keeps picking on the same few and expects that the rest will fall in line out of fear.’ That evening, as Rajeev shared his feelings with Sri and asked for her views, she was happy to see him so involved in the topic. It was as if they were discussing another case study back in B-school. She somehow felt confident that on this occasion Rajeev would choose the ‘fight’ mode as opposed to the usual ‘flight’ mode. ‘How does one make Sundar stop humiliating people? After all, we know that people don’t change so easily,’ said Rajeev. ‘Well, you know we all have our worst nightmares and deep within our hearts we often dread that they may come true. I guess people could change when suddenly confronted with a real possibility that their worst nightmare may come true!’ said Sri. Something clicked in Rajeev’s head at that exact moment. ‘I think I just found the solution,’ said Rajeev, heading out of the room, and leaving Sri looking curious. She knew it was best to leave him alone when inspiration descended on him. The next day, as Rajeev left for his office, Sri noticed a sealed pink envelope jutting out of his shirt pocket. She raised her eyebrows, but Rajeev merely smiled. And every day, over the next five days, Sri noticed that he diligently placed the pink envelope in the same way in his shirt pocket. On the fifth day, Sundar called Rajeev to his room. ‘What’s this pink envelope you’ve been carrying around?’ Sundar asked, pointing to Rajeev’s pocket, as he was taking a seat. ‘I am glad you finally noticed, Sundar. That’s my resignation letter in there.’ ‘What? Is this some kind of a joke?’ asked a flustered Sundar. ‘No, Sundar. This really is my resignation letter.’ ‘But why would you resign? You know I value your contribution here. Is there anything you are dissatisfied with?’ ‘Now that you ask, let me be honest with you. I am very happy here and I know you value and appreciate my contribution. But what bothers me, and please don’t get me wrong, is the way I see you humiliate some of the senior folk at times.’ ‘But you know I only shout at those who are inefficient.’ ‘I know that, Sundar. But I am worried that in case for some reason you do shout at me, I will not be able to take it. The only way out for me, if that happens, would be to immediately give you this pink envelope.’ ‘How can you say that, Rajeev? You, of all people here, know that you are more like an advisor to me,’ Sundar protested. ‘Then, in that case, Sundar, I would be failing you if I did not point out that the stakes for you in this are much higher than for any of us.’ ‘Of course, I know that. I own this company.’ ‘I don’t mean it that way. Just imagine what would happen if, one day, when you shout at someone in public, that person turns around and shouts back at you. Where would that leave you?’ Sundar fell silent; he had a serious look on his face. Rajeev was worried he had crossed the line. The two of them sat across each other – Sundar staring at Rajeev and the latter, head bent, looking at his hands, kept folded on his lap. After what seemed an eternity, Sundar stood up, walked over to where Rajeev was seated, took out the envelope from his pocket, opened it, pulled out the resignation letter, tore it up, walked around to the waste paper basket, and threw it in. He then took the pink envelope, pinned it to the centre of the board behind his chair, and said with a smile, ‘That should serve as a constant reminder to me. And please, let this remain between us!’ That night, Sri was comforted to see Rajeev very relaxed. He gave her a complete rundown of what transpired that day right up to the point when Sundar had pinned the pink envelope on the board to serve as a reminder for him. ‘So you think Sundar will change his behaviour?’ she asked. ‘I am sure of that,’ replied Rajeev. ‘How can you be so sure? People don’t change just like that.’ ‘I guess Sundar realized that someone shouting back at him publicly could be his worst nightmare coming true. That was the real and present danger.’ ‘I guess you are right,’ said a visibly happy Sri.",

      "content": "3 Chip on the Shoulder Shreya, who was pursing her MS degree at the Columbia School of Journalism, New York, was delighted that The Washington Post had just accepted her application for an internship with them. She wanted to call her parents immediately and share the good news. She, however, decided to call them the next day, as it would be midnight in Mumbai at that hour. Tuesday, 11 September 2001. Shreya had set her alarm for 10 a.m. as the first lecture was scheduled at noon. She woke with a start to the loud ringing of her phone. Still not fully awake, she glanced at her bedside clock; it showed 9.30 a.m. She reached for the phone and pressed it to her ear and immediately held it away. ‘Hello Shreya, hope you are safe, baby?’ her mother, calling from Mumbai, was practically screaming into the phone. ‘I am fine, Ma. Why are you shouting? Hope all is well?’ ‘Why are you not watching the TV? They are showing planes crashing into tall buildings in New York. Please come back immediately. That place is not safe anymore.’ Her mother was incoherent. Shreya had to raise her voice, ‘Is Daddy there? I want to speak with him.’ Her father came on the phone and spoke in a calm voice, ‘Shreya, we are watching CNN. Apparently, this morning in New York, some terrorists have hijacked a few planes. Two of these have been flown straight into the World Trade Center towers. Hope you are fine?’ She heard her mother in the background, shouting at her father, ‘Please ask her to come back at once.’ ‘Dad, please assure mummy that I am fine. I have just got up and need to see what’s happening here. I will call you in an hour’s time.’ Shreya was worried about her mother, who was a heart patient. Two hours later, she spoke with her father. She informed him that things seemed to be under control and that there was no need to panic. She then told him about the internship offer from The Washington Post. He congratulated Shreya and informed her that he had convinced her mother that it was safe for Shreya to complete her graduation, which was just ten months away, and then return to Mumbai permanently. He reminded her about her mother’s heart condition and convinced her that this was the only option. He put his wife on the phone. ‘I am very worried for you Shreya,’ she said. ‘I have agreed to your completing your studies there only on one condition. You must call me every day. Once in the morning and once just before going to bed.’ Shreya agreed to this and promised that she would return immediately once she graduated. ‘Thank you, Shreya. I am sure you will get a good job here,’ said her mother. Shreya felt devastated. Her dreams of working in the US had been blown away just as the twin towers had collapsed. After a series of videoconference interviews with a few national newspapers in India, she accepted an offer for a sub-editor’s position at Mumbai’s leading daily. Her reasons for choosing this particular publication went beyond her need to be at home with her parents. The editor, Siddhartha (Sid), was an alumnus of Columbia School of Journalism and he was a well-respected voice in media circles in India. Shreya graduated in the summer of 2002 and was soon on the flight to Mumbai. Her mother was elated to have her little girl back at home. After taking a few days’ break to catch up with some of her school friends, Shreya reported to work. She was in complete awe of Sid when she met him in person. He welcomed her warmly and spoke to her about the company, its history, and culture. He displayed great patience while answering her questions and encouraged her to meet him if she ever had any issues. When the meeting was over, he walked her to the door. After that, she met her boss, the deputy editor, who later introduced her to the other four sub-editors. Shreya soon hit the ground running. She was an active participant in the morning review meetings and offered many a suggestion. In order to foster greater collaboration within the team, the deputy editor encouraged them to critique one another’s work. While the deputy editor admired Shreya’s openness and zeal, she sensed that her colleagues were not too enthused by her behaviour. She observed that the other four would be together at lunch while Shreya would be seated at another table. Was she being subtly ostracized? The deputy editor shared her observations with Sid. ‘Is there a natural leader amongst the other four girls?’ asked Sid. ‘I think that is Priya. The others are often influenced by her.’ ‘Why not put Shreya and Priya to work together on a story? That may get them closer and once that happens the rest will also accept her,’ said Sid. Shreya was super excited about working on an important story. Priya and she really put their everything into it and were seen working late into the evenings. Shreya did most of the research and, a week later, the story was ready. It would go to print once it was cleared by the deputy editor. Shreya’s mother fell sick the next day and Shreya was forced to stay at home for a few days. Three days later, she was back at work and was delighted to see their story on the front page that morning as the second lead. She read the story and was elated that most of her points were carried with very little editing. As her eyes moved up, she suddenly felt very sick. The byline carried only one name – Priya. Disgusted, she confronted the deputy editor with a copy of the newspaper. ‘You know I worked my back off for this story. How could you clear it without my name in the byline?’ she demanded. ‘Look Shreya, I was not in yesterday. I saw it this morning and I wanted to ask you why you had not put your name in this story,’ replied the deputy editor. ‘Oh, it is Priya then! I am sorry,’ said Shreya, and rushed out. Priya and her colleagues were standing around the coffee machine. ‘How could you do this?’ shouted Shreya, waving the newspaper in front of Priya’s face. ‘Do what?’ asked Priya with an innocent look. ‘Leave my name out in the byline of our story!’ Priya still looked unflustered. ‘Let me see … Oh yes, your name is missing. I am so sorry. Looks like I forgot to add it when I sent in the final copy for Sid’s approval.’ As Shreya stood there, fuming, another colleague stepped in. ‘Please don’t make a fuss, Shreya. Sometimes these things happen. And Priya has apologized, hasn’t she?’ Shreya looked around and noticed that many of the other staff members on their floor had stopped doing what they were doing and were staring in her direction. ‘Okay,’ said Shreya and walked in the direction of her cubicle. She could hear the other sub-editors snicker as she turned her back on them. She decided to take it up with Sid. Shreya looked distraught as she related her story to Sid. She started from the beginning and till the point when Priya had intentionally kept her name out of the credits. Sid listened with empathy and then spoke in a calm, measured tone: ‘Let us, for a moment, assume that Priya did intentionally drop your name from the credits. Why would she do that?’ ‘Because she is jealous of me and is insecure.’ ‘And what makes her jealous and insecure?’ ‘Not just her, even the other three sub-editors have this problem.’ ‘Is it about them or is it about you, Shreya?’ ‘I don’t understand what you mean. Now I am to be blamed? I might as well just quit.’ ‘Is their behaviour an intrinsic part of their DNA or merely a reaction to something you could have said or done inadvertently? And by the way, you don’t solve anything by quitting.’ ‘I really don’t know,’ said Shreya. ‘Remember, people often have preconceived notions about us. The other girls, who are all graduates from the prestigious Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, underwent a rigorous selection process to get here. They know you are from a famous international journalism school, and all you went through was a video conference interview with me. How would you feel if you were any of them?’ ‘I guess I would think that I am privileged,’ replied Shreya. ‘And what else?’ prodded Sid. ‘And that I would come with a chip on my shoulder.’ ‘And…’ ‘And they would see attitude in everything I said or did. Even if I did not mean it.’ ‘Exactly! And do you think anything like that happened here?’ Shreya thought for a while and lowered her eyes and said, ‘Well, I think at times…’ ‘Can you recollect any critical incident?’ ‘Well, I guess in my eagerness to prove myself, I could have stepped on a few toes. My efforts to give feedback were genuine, but they may have seen this as a superiority complex.’ ‘More so, if I route the feedback through my superior rather than give it privately to them, don’t you think?’ enquired Sid. How did Sid know, Shreya wondered. She replied, ‘I see what you mean, Sid.’ ‘And remember, the other four have known each other for many years before you came on the scene. So, if one of them feels hurt or insecure about you, the others will all reflect this feeling even if they have not experienced it themselves.’ ‘Yes, I can recall such instances. So, what should I do?’ asked Shreya. ‘If I were you, I would try and build a rapport with them first as individuals and then as a group.’ ‘Thanks a lot, Sid. I guess, when I point a finger at someone I need to see the other three fingers pointing back at me,’ said Shreya with a slight laugh. ‘And finally, remember one cardinal rule: In life, no person is an island. And this is always true in an organizational setting. Even the smartest and brightest person can only succeed if they learn to collaborate as equals,’ said Sid. As Shreya thanked Sid and walked out of his cabin, she realized that not even once did she feel that he was judging her.",

      "content": "4 Judging a Book by Its Cover ‘This would never have happened if only you had listened to me,’ yelled Urmila. ‘Sure, and hindsight is always 20/20,’ Aman retorted. ‘You seem to put your future repeatedly in Ranjit’s hands. And see where we are now!’ she hit back. Aman sensed that his wife was reaching a breaking point. ‘I know, Urmi, but we cannot blame Ranjit for everything. Don’t worry, something will come up soon,’ he said, trying to calm her. It was day 75 of his of 90-day notice period. He had sent his resume to 25 companies. Not a single response! Aman and Ranjit went back a long way. To a time before Urmila arrived in the scene. It was in 1988 that Aman had graduated in textile engineering and joined a leading textile company in north India. He was assigned to work under Ranjit, the business head. Aman and Ranjit hit it off well, even though the latter was twelve years senior to Aman. Both had a love for the outdoors. Ranjit was into photography and made it a point to carry his camera along on his travels abroad. They would often travel together on business trips and made sure they visited as many tourist spots as possible. One night, when Ranjit returned early from one of his long trips and opened his apartment door with the key that he used to carry, he heard laughter coming from his bedroom. He barged in. His wife was lying in the arms of another man whom he did not recognize. With a shocked look on her face she quickly stood up and wrapped herself in a bed sheet. The other man too got out of bed and walked slowly towards his clothes spread on the sofa in the far corner. He was taller than Ranjit, younger, and better built too. The way he nonchalantly looked at Ranjit while he dressed seemed as if he was daring him to make a move. Ranjit moved away from the door as the other man walked out. His wife stood in the corner looking at her feet. ‘You can get out of that bed sheet and get dressed,’ he said, as he sat down on the bed, his head in his hands. A zillion thoughts were racing through his mind, none of which made sense. Something deep within him suddenly snapped. How could she? He loved her so much. And now this? She put on her clothes and turned towards Ranjit. He raised his head with a look that clearly asked: Why? That was her cue, probably. ‘What do you expect me to do? You are always away on those long trips. God knows doing what!’ He said nothing and moved out of the flat to a service apartment. They divorced a year later. And he never married again. Ranjit was the best man at Aman’s marriage and Urmila was happy to see how Aman and he got along so well. However, as the months went by, Urmila’s fondness for Ranjit waned. She did not like the fact that Aman spent so much time away from home and she blamed this on the fact that Ranjit was divorced and had no family to come home to. As it is, she did not like men who were divorcees. Urmila finally forced Aman to find another job and move away from Ranjit. Six years later, Ranjit again connected with Aman. ‘Hi, Ranjit what a surprise hearing from you. What has it been… six years now?’ Aman said, answering the phone. ‘That’s right, Aman. How are you doing? How are Urmila and the twins?’ ‘All fine, Ranjit. How are you? Where are you now?’ ‘I am moving to head a company in Noida that has been acquired by a US textile giant. I am hoping you will join me as the marketing head.’ ‘Ranjit, you know Urmila and the kids are well settled here, and I really enjoy my work.’ ‘Aman, why don’t we do this? Let’s set up a call for tomorrow at 3 p.m. and I will tell you more. Please convey my regards to Urmila. Good night for now.’ ‘All right. Good night.’ Urmila, who had overheard Aman’s side of the conversation, waited for him to speak. ‘You remember Ranjit?’ he said. ‘He has picked up a great job with a US-based company and wants me to join him in Noida.’ ‘Aman, we are so well settled here.’ Urmila did not sound too happy. ‘I know. But let us hear him out at least. I have a call with him tomorrow afternoon.’ Aman said. ‘Has he remarried?’ ‘How would I know?’ replied Aman with a frown. He was aware that Urmila blamed Ranjit for the divorce. ‘I think Ranjit wants you there purely for his own selfish needs. I don’t want you to put our future in his hands again,’ said Urmila. ‘I don’t have a good feeling about this at all! These US companies are, in any case, famous for shutting down operations at the slightest headwind.’ Urmila tried her best to dissuade Aman from accepting Ranjit’s offer. She finally gave in when she saw how keen Aman was, as she did not want to carry the blame later. Life in Noida was a clear upgrade for Aman and Urmila. The company-leased apartment was spacious with many added amenities. Aman travelled abroad often. They now holidayed in Thailand and Singapore, courtesy the many frequent flyer miles that he had accumulated. Everyone was happy, but good times rarely last forever! A Chinese company bought out the Asia operations of their company. The Indian operations would now focus on supplying yarn and fabric to China where these would be converted to finished products. The marketing function was shut down in India and Aman and his teams were laid off with ninety days’ notice. The two of them were clearly devastated, and Urmila’s animosity towards Ranjit multiplied a thousand-fold. ‘I am sure he would have known a long time ago that this was to happen. Had he given us enough warning, by now you would have found another job,’ she said. ‘I don’t think he knew this would happen. This whole deal must have been done overseas, with India playing no role,’ said Aman defending Ranjit. ‘I don’t believe that. And why do you continue defending him? He has not been laid off,’ said Urmila. A few days after their fight, Aman informed Urmila, ‘Ranjit wants to come over for coffee tomorrow.’ She was not pleased but relented. The next day, as Ranjit stepped into their apartment, he could sense Urmila’s hostility. ‘Anything has come up, Aman?’ he asked. Aman shook his head, ‘Nothing yet Ranjit, and I am starting to give up hope.’ Aman was on the verge of tears and Urmila came over and sat next to him as if to console him. ‘This would never have happened if we had stayed in Pune. We don’t have much saved up as it is. Most of our savings were used up in buying a house for Aman’s parents and in the down payment for our apartment in Bangalore. After fifteen days, we really don’t know what we’re going to do or where we will go,’ she said, tears forming in her eyes. Ranjit inhaled sharply and said, ‘I feel bad for what has happened. I may not be affected right now, but I don’t think they will want me around for long. But that’s not why I came here.’ Urmila and Aman looked confused. ‘What I am going to say may be a bit personal but please don’t misunderstand me. I consider you both as family and, in a way, I feel responsible for what has happened.’ ‘Please don’t say that,’ said Aman. ‘How could you know this would happen?’ ‘I can see you both are tense because the notice period runs out in the next fifteen days. Just tell me what would you estimate your bare minimum monthly expenses to be?’ Aman and Urmila looked at each other. They did not know where Ranjit was going with this. Aman quickly calculated a rough figure of Rs 150,000 a month, including the EMI for their apartment. Ranjit drew out his cheque-book from his pocket and wrote out a cheque for Rs 18 lakh. He handed it over to Aman and said, ‘Please don’t get me wrong. I have some money in a fixed deposit. Please take this as a loan and now assume that you have another 12 months to find a new job. You don’t need to stress yourself any more, and believe me, something will surely work out.’ The shock they felt was written all over Aman’s and Urmila’s faces. Ranjit continued, ‘People fight too many shadows on being laid off. They assume that their current lifestyle is the bare minimum required for survival and wonder how they would manage. But that’s not really the case. The most important thing is to remember that lay-offs are a reality now and never let it impact your self-worth.’ Urmila looked at Aman and then at Ranjit. She had been so wrong about Ranjit. They decided to accept Ranjit’s offer. Four months later, Aman found a job, and soon, repaid Ranjit’s loan. The difficult days were behind them and the whole experience had made them stronger and wiser. They vowed not to splurge till they had a sizeable amount, at least a year’s expenses, in the bank. But most importantly, Urmila learnt never to judge a book by its cover.",

      "content": "5 Collaborators in the Time of Corporate Takeovers Ayesha was faced with a dilemma, but happy to be in that situation. She had topped her class at IIM Bangalore and had already received an attractive job offer from one of the big four consulting firms. And now, here she was, seated in front of Utkarsh, the CEO of a fast-growing software company, who had just made her an offer. Actually, two offers. ‘You can come in as an assistant manager in our strategy team or you can join as my executive assistant, or EA,’ he said. ‘Which of these two has better prospects?’ she asked. ‘Both have good prospects. But please remember, if you come in as my EA, you will have a ringside seat in my office as a fly on the wall. You will observe and be involved in matters they never teach at any management institute. And you can later move into a key position in any of the verticals.’ Ayesha chose to join as Utkarsh’s EA as he was not only well respected in industry associations but also a much sought-after speaker at various national and international forums. She never regretted her decision. The many hours she spent working on Utkarsh’s speeches provided her with rare insights into his mind. He truly cared for and believed in his people. Not once did she hear him pass judgement on any person or hurt someone’s dignity. He handpicked and nurtured his team and his only demand from them was ‘no surprises in their areas of work’. In return, he assured them that he would always be there for them. His favourite and oft-repeated quote was, ‘We will always remain a great team so long as we continue to talk “to” each other just the way we talk “about” one another.’ It was no surprise that Utkarsh soon became her role model. Ayesha was with Utkarsh in his office one afternoon when he received a phone call. ‘Yes, please put him through,’ said Utkarsh to Ayesha. ‘Hello, yes, this is Utkarsh. Good afternoon.’ He paused, listening intently. He continued, ‘Yes, I was expecting your call. When would your team like to come over? Please let me have your contact numbers and I will have our CFO co-ordinate this. Thank you … and you too.’ The call took no more than a minute or two, but Ayesha had never seen anyone age so suddenly in so short a time. ‘Hope all is well, Utkarsh,’ she said, concerned. ‘Yes, Ayesha. Just need a moment to catch my breath.’ She waited. ‘That call was from the Mumbai office of a New York-based investment bank. They have a mandate from our US parent-company to find a suitable buyer for us. You would have observed that I let them believe that I was expecting their call,’ he said. Their company was a listed entity in India, with the majority of shares held by an American company. Utkarsh spoke as if talking to himself: ‘I am the CEO here, yet no one had the courtesy to keep me informed. I guess that is the reality of corporate life.’ Events moved quickly after the call. Data-rooms were set up and three likely buyers spent time in completing the due diligence process. In about three months the company changed hands. The new owner was a large telecom hardware manufacturer, headquartered in North Carolina, with production facilities in USA, Europe, China and Singapore. Utkarsh now reported to Ronnie, who was based in the US and was in charge of Asia. Post the acquisition, Ronnie spent twenty days in India meeting with Utkarsh and other key members. He was happy to note that Utkarsh was highly respected by all employees and enjoyed great credibility amongst clients in all geographies as well as with industry associations, analysts and the media. The India operations continued to deliver outstanding results. The quarterly board reviews were now held in Charlotte, North Carolina, to which Utkarsh and his team flew out from Bangalore. During one such meeting, the chairman was all praise for the way Utkarsh continued to grow the India business and observed that Ronnie could learn a few things from Utkarsh. As time went by, Utkarsh was often invited to the US to participate in strategic discussions involving the parent company’s businesses in other geographies. Ayesha soon sensed a perceptible change in Ronnie’s behaviour on his subsequent trips to India. Unlike in his earlier visits, he now spent less time with Utkarsh and spent more time individually with each of his direct reportees. Utkarsh was happy that his team members had the opportunity to get better exposure and earn more visibility. Only if he had known what Ronnie was up to! During his one-on-one meetings with Utkarsh’s direct reportees, Ronnie enquired if they could manage the company in case Utkarsh was moved to another geography. Ambition and greed soon came to the fore. Seizing the opportunity, each of them assured Ronnie that Utkarsh had functioned mostly as an administrative head, managing the industry associations and the media. When it came to client relationships, business acquisitions, and managing delivery, it was they who really ran the show, they said. Vidur, the global sales head, particularly impressed Ronnie. A week later, all employees received Ronnie’s email. Utkarsh was leaving for personal reasons and Vidur would be the new CEO. Ronnie hosted a farewell dinner for Utkarsh to which the top management executives were invited. Many spoke on the occasion and Ayesha was shocked to see the hypocrisy displayed by Utkarsh’s direct reportees. He had nurtured and helped each of them grow to where they were. And today, every one of them had betrayed him. His chosen six had forsaken him for the temptations of office and money. The irony of the situation incensed her. ‘Christ had to deal with but one Judas!’ she thought. On the day that Utkarsh finally demitted office, Ayesha was amongst the few who walked him to his car. As they shook hands, she said. ‘After all that you have done for them, I feel terrible about the way they behaved.’ Utkarsh understood whom she was referring to. He put a hand on her shoulder and said, ‘I have no complaints against any one, Ayesha. Such things come with the territory. To expect otherwise would be to fool oneself and invite unnecessary hurt.’ She brushed aside her tears and waved him goodbye. She was now EA to Vidur who had moved into Utkarsh’s room. Ayesha always knew Vidur to be an ambitious person. But it’s only after he became the CEO that she witnessed the full extent of his ambitions. While Utkarsh was open to suggestions and shared his knowledge with everyone, Vidur turned out to be quite the opposite. He was close-minded and would feel insecure if his direct reportees met Ronnie when he was not around. Utkarsh had encouraged Ronnie to meet up with their global clients and often accompanied him to such meetings, Vidur always managed to find some excuses not to expose Ronnie to their clients. Oft-stated reasons were that the clients themselves were travelling. The company’s growth and profits in the next two quarters took a substantial dip. The next board meeting in Charlotte was a heated one. The chairman observed that Vidur and Ronnie were at loggerheads and no one knew what was to be done to improve things. The chairman, who was very upset and losing patience with each passing day, asked Ronnie to see him later in his office. The chairman and Ronnie had worked together for over twenty years and this was the first time that Ronnie seemed not in control of his business. They met in the chairman’s office. ‘What’s happening, Ronnie? Am I getting a sense that Vidur is trying to blame you for the debacle in India?’ ‘I did get that feeling in the meeting today. I am shocked at this guy’s audacity,’ said Ronnie. ‘Since the day you asked Utkarsh to leave and made this guy the CEO, things have just gone downhill. Did we read it wrong?’ he asked. ‘At least Utkarsh was open and supportive. This guy is so closed and insecure. Even his erstwhile colleagues are very unhappy and we may soon lose them if nothing is done,’ said Ronnie. ‘Well, India is your baby now. If you want to make any changes, I am with you. Do whatever it takes but please stem the rot immediately or this acquisition is going to make us all, especially me, look very bad,’ said the chairman. In the week following the board meeting, all employees received another email from Ronnie. ‘Vidur is leaving the organization due to personal reasons. Naresh, the global head of sales, will be the new CEO.’ Even that decision did not help. Over the next four quarters, the company continued to make major losses and was soon sold in what was considered a distress sale. Ayesha had seen enough and connected with Utkarsh who had started his own consulting firm with private equity investments. She met him over lunch and apprised him of all that had happened after his departure from the company. He expressed regret on how things had turned out. There was not a grain of bitterness in his voice or malice towards anyone. She could not hold back her feelings. ‘I fail to understand how you can be so forgiving. Serves them right for ganging up against you.’ ‘Ayesha, remember what happens post a merger-and-acquisition in the industry is no different from what happened in the past when one country invaded and occupied another,’ said Utkarsh. Ayesha did not understand. He explained, ‘The elite in the country being invaded often collaborated with the invading force against their own rulers. They were just trying to protect their own interests. What makes you think the corporate world is any different? Vidur and the others were only protecting their own interests. ‘And look at the positive side. You get to observe and learn things that you would never have learnt anywhere else. Okay, let’s leave all that aside. Tell me, when are you joining us?’ Ayesha felt blessed that she would work with him again.",

      "content": "6 Strange Are the Ways of Karma The offer was too good to pass up! I grabbed it with both hands. After all, tell me, how many make it to the CEO position by the age of forty? In a global technology company! Located in Silicon Valley in the US! Many congratulated me; even those who, I knew, were envious of my success. There were also some naysayers who warned me that I had never worked at this level before. ‘Don’t you think you are punching above your weight?’ asked my colleague and a good friend at my workplace in Bangalore. ‘Why do you say that?’ I asked, knowing he only meant well. ‘From your present role as the head of technology to that of a CEO is a whole new ballgame. And that too located in the US. Are you sure you are up to it?’ ‘Guess I am. The only issue I see is for my wife and kids to adjust to the culture there.’ ‘As a CEO, you will be dealing with a lot more ambiguity than ever before. And remember, success at that level is all about your ability to read and manage the politics at the top,’ he cautioned me. I replied with a nervous laugh: ‘As they say, if one has managed senior folk in India, then one can do it anywhere in the world.’ We soon moved to Menlo Park in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. The company, with over fifteen thousand employees and operations in eight countries, was a leading player in IT solutions and services, including systems integration, information systems, IT-enabled services and software development space. Every country head of the company reported to me. Our biggest presence was in India, which had three centres. Bhaskar headed our operations there and was based out of Mumbai. My wife and kids loved the large, independent house with spacious gardens in the front and the back. The company also helped with admissions in a prestigious school and the school bus picked up and dropped the kids right outside our home. Srini, the founder and chairman, threw a welcome dinner for us where we met other senior colleagues and their wives. It was a fine gesture and helped in our smooth transition to the new location. As the CEO, I was primarily responsible for the delivery centres across various geographies. I met up with Srini first and shared my 100-day plan with him, as this would be the ideal way to get to know his expectations from me. ‘All our centres are doing well. It’s India that worries me a bit. You know, we have over eight thousand employees there and we enjoy the best-cost arbitrage. Of late, we have seen many senior level people leave,’ said a concerned Srini. ‘I am planning to visit all our centres over the next three weeks. Shall look into some of these issues when I am in India,’ I said. ‘Last year we lost an outstanding performer to competition. And a key client moved with him. We have to stop this from happening again, Srini said’ ‘I shall spend some time with Bhaskar and am sure we can contain the problem there,’ I assured him. ‘And do spend some time with Tom before you embark on your trip. He has lost two HR heads in India during the last two years. He has a pretty good idea of what’s happening there.’ Tom, the chief people officer at corporate, had really gone out of his way to help with my induction. He had been in the company for over a decade and the two of us had built a good rapport in a short while. He came across as an objective person who never hesitated to speak his mind. We met in his room. ‘Hi, Tom I am planning to travel to our centres over the next few weeks. Srini spoke to me about the high employee attrition in India. Anything I need to know?’ I said. ‘India is quite different from the other geographies in the sense that Bhaskar virtually runs that place. He has only one customer within our company and that is Srini,’ replied Tom. ‘But then he reports into me,’ I said. Tom laughed, ‘Well, you will meet him soon and then you will know.’ This was worrisome. I had to know more. ‘Tell me Tom, how did the previous CEO manage Bhaskar?’ ‘Well, in the initial months he did try to rein him in, but gave up soon,’ said Tom. ‘Are you saying that Bhaskar has a hotline to Srini?’ I asked. ‘Well, it’s an open secret here that Srini is blindsided when it comes to Bhaskar,’ he said. ‘Really?’ I wanted Tom to enlighten me a bit more. ‘Srini and Bhaskar go back a long way. They come from the same town somewhere in south India and are, I believe, related in some distant sort of way.’ Tom then went on to provide some insights on the other centres located in Europe and the Far East. I was keen to know more about Bhaskar but refrained from asking any more probing questions. ‘And one more thing,’ said Tom. ‘While you are there, could you interview a candidate I am considering to head human resources in India? In the last two years we have lost two of them.’ ‘Sure, Tom. Please have your secretary set it up.’ Two weeks later I was with Bhaskar in his office in Mumbai. ‘Welcome to our company. Srini has briefed me about your background,’ said Bhaskar, seizing the initiative. I thanked him and requested him to bring me up to speed on our operations in India. As he spoke, I observed that he was very animated and exuded high energy. Every third sentence was punctuated with a ‘you know what I mean’ and his words came forth as if fired from a machine gun. His flaying hands and his eyes, which seemed to trace the path of an imaginary fly, kept distracting me. I asked him a few pointed questions on the high attrition of senior folk in India. ‘These are all self-serving kind of people. No loyalty. You know what I mean?’ he replied. ‘Surely you would have gathered something from them during the exit interviews?’ I pressed him. ‘Exit interviews are a formality. You know what I mean? Does anyone ever speak the truth during these interviews?’ he countered. ‘I would like to see the personal files of all who have left us in the last one year,’ I said, hoping to let him know who was the boss. ‘I will have my secretary send them to you to the visiting managers’ cabin,’ he replied. So now I was just a visiting manager to him. ‘I would like to meet up with your direct reportee too.’ ‘My secretary will arrange that. Do you want to meet them in the visiting managers’ room or in the boardroom?’ ‘I will meet them, one at a time, in my room,’ I said, laying emphasis on the words ‘my room’. If he caught the emphasis he clearly ignored it and said, ‘Srini spoke to me about you. He told me how the two of you often used to meet at conferences in Silicon Valley and in India and he is very happy that you accepted his offer.’ If this was an arm-wrestling match, Bhaskar was completely on top. He was a master at this; so, I beat a quiet retreat. For the moment. I thanked him and went over to the ‘visiting managers’ room. Over the next three days that I was there, I met up with Bhaskar’s direct reportees and the centre heads from the other two locations in India. It was obvious that they owed complete allegiance to Bhaskar. All of them echoed his sentiments on the reasons why so many senior folk had quit in the past two years. I called up the two HR heads who had quit in the last two years and introduced myself. I requested them to join me for dinner in the hotel where I stayed. I was keen to learn from their insights on their experience with us. I could use some of that when I interviewed the new candidate. To my surprise, they both agreed but requested that we meet at some other hotel. The two of them were very open and spoke without any bitterness or prejudice. I asked them what had provoked them to leave. While their reasons were quite different, there was one common factor: Bhaskar. ‘I understand that Srini and Bhaskar go a long way and are related in some way,’ I said hoping this would be a conversation opener. ‘Yes, they are related but very distant. It is obvious that Bhaskar runs this place exactly as he wants it. He has a set of favourite employees who form his coterie. As the HR head here, I often felt helpless that I was not able stand up for some employees who were being victimised. Even Tom was not able to do anything. I quit and moved on,’ one of them said. The other person informed me that he had to quit when one of the female employees complained of sexual harassment by her function head. Bhaskar chose to look the other way, as the accused person was his blue-eyed boy who managed a very large client. Bhaskar forced the girl to leave and the HR head put in his papers too after he raised the matter with Srini but was politely told to leave it to Bhaskar. In summary, the dinner meeting proved to be very useful. The next day, as the HR candidate’s resume was placed before me, I realized that he had worked with me a few years ago. As he entered my room, I walked over and shook hands, ‘Hi, Anubhav. What a pleasant surprise! I am so happy to see you here.’ ‘Same here. I was told I would be meeting the CEO, but would never have guessed I would be meeting you,’ he said. The interview was a mere formality. In fact, I did most of the talking. I called Tom that evening and informed him that he had the perfect candidate in Anubhav and apprised him of our having worked together. I had a couple of more meetings with Bhaskar and then flew off to the US. The company continued to do well. Bhaskar and I tried to get along. I made my suggestions and he did exactly what he wanted to do. I tried to seek Srini’s intervention but it was pointless. Bhaskar could do no wrong. We continued to lose senior folk in India and Bhaskar’s views always prevailed. ‘They are all cultural misfits. You know what I mean!’ was his refrain. Anubhav and I spoke regularly about this and he often shared details of Bhaskar’s misdeeds. I tried bringing some of those to Srini’s notice but to no avail. I decided to let things be and focus on other centres. I had to admit that I had failed in managing these dynamics at the top. Did I take on the CEO role ahead of my time? Things went on smoothly for a year or so, till that morning when Anubhav called to tell me he had decided to quit. ‘Is it not late in India at this time, Anubhav?’ I asked. ‘Yes, it is. I had to speak with my wife and we have decided that this is the best course of action for me,’ he said. ‘What happened?’ ‘Nothing new. It’s Bhaskar again. You know that we have no analytics practice in our company. He managed to interest a potential client looking to outsource a large part of the analytics work. It could have been a multi-million-dollar opportunity. So, we hired a very senior lady from a large company here to help build the analytics team in order to showcase the same to the potential client when they would visit us next month. She joined us last week and brought along three of her team members. This morning we were informed that the client would not be coming to India this year. Bhaskar just got me to fire the lady and her team this evening. I cannot take this anymore,’ said Anubhav. ‘I know how you feel, Anubhav. Surely, we will look at what you are saying and do something about it,’ I said. ‘You know what is happening. Bhaskar’s unethical behaviour is destroying this place. Earlier there were only whispers, but now everyone is openly talking about it. And the fact that corporate is allowing these things to continue, has completely destroyed the morale out here.’ I knew Anubhav had made up his mind. Had I been in his place, I would have done the same. I realized that amidst this cloud there existed a silver lining. I would use it to my advantage to put Bhaskar in his place. ‘I have to go into a meeting now. Why don’t I have a detailed talk with you later in the evening, our time. Should be tomorrow morning for you. Let me set up a bridge and send you the details,’ I said. ‘Okay, I shall take the call from home.’ I set up the bridge and sought some time with Srini. ‘Our HR head in India has just quit. This is the third one to go in three years,’ I informed him. ‘Did he give any reasons?’ asked Srini. ‘He is very unhappy with some of Bhaskar’s unethical behaviour. You know the other HR heads too had similar problems,’ I said hoping he would at least listen now. ‘It’s all hearsay. I think it is not fair to make such allegations unless we have some hard, irrefutable facts.’ ‘I have set up a bridge for a call with Anubhav this evening. I would request you to just silently listen in. He doesn’t know you would be there,’ I said hoping that at least this would open Srini’s eyes. I called in at 7 p.m. that evening and waited. Anubhav joined the call. At one level I felt uncomfortable that I had not informed him about Srini listening in. I consoled myself thinking that the end justified the means. After exchanging initial pleasantries, I went about the task of making him narrate how things were out there. ‘Yes, you were saying when we last spoke, that the situation in India is turning from bad to worse. The kind of unethical things happening there has started causing low morale everywhere and that more senior folk will soon quit. Could you elaborate on that?’ I said, wanting to draw him out to name Bhaskar. He sounded less agitated and spoke with a calm voice. ‘I think there is a disconnect in the way we set expectations when employees join us. I don’t think most of the people who join us are used to the pace of work out here. You know we rightly push everyone to achieve greater heights but these folk are not used to this. Many who are not able to match up in our performance-driven culture just find reasons to quit and make allegations against the senior folk here.’ I was shocked and completely lost for words. Things were moving quite in the opposite direction and this call would make me look bad in Srini’s eyes. I attempted to retrieve the situation but nothing worked. Anubhav continued to praise our culture. Realizing that I was not getting anywhere, I thanked him for his time and got off the call. Two minutes later, I called him on his mobile phone. ‘Anubhav, what was all that about? What happened? What you said on the call was completely different from what you had said last night. What happened between then and now? Why all this sudden fondness for our culture?’ I demanded an answer. It was then that he dropped his first bomb: ‘Well you never told me you had invited Srini to listen in on the call.’ And before I could answer, he dropped the second bomb. Much bigger than the first one. ‘And did you know that Srini had invited Bhaskar to also quietly listen in?’ he said and waited for an answer. ‘I am sorry, Anubhav. I did ask Srini to listen in. He just refuses to see the truth and I thought this was the only way. I apologize for not telling you. But how do you know that Srini asked Bhaskar to also listen in?’ ‘Well, this morning, half an hour before the call, Bhaskar called me and said he was aware of our call. He then told me that you had invited Srini to silently listen in. And then what he said took my breath away. He said that Srini had sent him the bridge details and asked him to listen in and that no one knows about this but me.’ Bhaskar had outsmarted me again. And before I could say anything, Anubhav said it all for me. ‘I don’t blame you for what happened. In fact, I am glad this happened. It has only vindicated my decision to leave this messed up place. And I seriously wonder how you can continue to work here.’ He was so right!",

      "content": "7 The Mighty Sticky Note Nidhi was always clear on what she wanted to do once she finished her schooling. She did her undergraduate programme in economics from Cambridge University, and her master’s in financial engineering from a prestigious college in the US. She then joined Barclays Bank at their corporate office at Canary Wharf, London. After two years with them, she applied and made it to the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford, from where she graduated at the top of her class in 2005. The Boston Consulting Group picked her from campus and she was one of the star performers. She spent six years with them in the UK before moving to India to be with her old parents in Mumbai. Nidhi soon joined another leading consulting firm in Mumbai and here too she was consistently rated as a best performer and promoted twice in four years. At an industry meet at the Taj Mahal Hotel, during lunch, she happened to be seated next to the CEO of the Indian subsidiary of a large US bank. Her educational background, her experience at Barclays and in the consulting firms particularly impressed him. They exchanged cards and a week later he called her. ‘Hi, Nidhi remember me? We met at the Taj over lunch last week during the seminar on global leadership practices.’ ‘Of course, I remember,’ she said. ‘Oh, that’s nice. Let me come straight to the point. After ten years of continuous growth, there has been a slight blip in our bank’s performance this year. Our corporate office in the US has suggested we engage one of the big four consulting firms and evolve a strategic roadmap for the future.’ ‘That’s a great idea. I would also suggest that such an exercise must be refreshed every three years or so. Going forward, you could do this either with your internal resources or engage an external consultant,’ said Nidhi. ‘Exactly what I had in mind. I am actually looking to hire someone who can drive such an initiative and build a strategic team here. And in my opinion, someone like you is the best person to do this,’ said the CEO. ‘Well, I am flattered,’ said Nidhi. ‘I mean it,’ said the CEO. ‘This is a leadership position and would have visibility right into our corporate office in the US.’ ‘Sounds interesting! I would like to know more,’ said Nidhi. They met the following week where the CEO elaborated on the role. The compensation was much higher than her current one and she would be the head of strategy, reporting to the CEO. ‘So, what are the next steps?’ she asked. ‘My leadership team, of which you would be a member, now comprises our COO, CFO, heads of consumer and commercial banking and the chief human resources officer (CHRO). I would like them to meet you too. As far as I am concerned, these meetings are more of a formality but I believe that this would help foster greater team spirit,’ said the CEO. ‘I think that’s a great idea. I would appreciate if this can be done in a short time so that I can put in my papers with my current employers,’ said Nidhi. ‘Sure. I will introduce you to our CHRO and then have him co-ordinate meetings with the others.’ The CHRO seemed to be a pleasant person and quite supportive. Besides helping her understand the organization, its history and culture, he also shared his insights on the other leadership team members. ‘The CFO and I joined around four years ago. We are not from the industry. The COO and the heads of consumer and commercial banking are from the banking industry and have been here for seven years. In fact, the three of them worked at the same bank prior to coming here,’ said the CHRO. ‘So, is there anything I need to watch out for?’ asked Nidhi. ‘Not really. They are all professionals. But yes, they are close-knit and do influence each other a lot.’ ‘Thank you for letting me know. I guess if I know my work and do things diligently here, everything should be okay.’ The CHRO gave her a smile. The meetings with the others went on well and in a month’s time Nidhi joined the bank. Within a week of her joining, the CEO called for a meeting of the leadership team. ‘Now that Nidhi is with us, our first priority is to initiate the strategy planning exercise. Our chairman would be personally tracking this and we need to make things happen soon.’ The COO spoke first: ‘My friend heads of one of the big Four consulting firms here. I suggest we just call him and hand over the assignment right away to them.’ The heads of consumer and commercial banking seconded his views. The CEO looked at Nidhi: ‘Let’s hear what Nidhi has to say.’ She addressed the COO: ‘While that would certainly speed up things, it may not necessarily get us the best deal. Let’s invite all the Big Four to pitch for our business. This way, we not only get to see a variety of approaches but we can also negotiate the best fees.’ The COO, who considered himself more equal than the others in the leadership team, was clearly not happy. ‘I have already spoken with my friend and they are very keen to work with us,’ he said. The CEO looked around the table. None of the others ventured any suggestions and he was not surprised. ‘I feel the easiest thing to do would be to give this assignment to the firm where Nidhi worked prior to joining us. They know her and things would move pretty fast. I appreciate that Nidhi did not suggest that,’ said the CEO. The COO responded, ‘Well, I only made that suggestion as time is of essence. If Nidhi can fast forward the whole process of shortlisting a firm, I have no problem.’ And so it was decided. Nidhi got to work immediately. She prepared the pitch brief and circulated the same amongst her colleagues seeking their comments. When the CEO saw the document, he felt vindicated on his decision to hire Nidhi. The document was comprehensive and clearly articulated the expectations from the consulting firms and laid down the evaluation criteria on the basis of which the final shortlist would be made. The CEO immediately sent back the documents commending Nidhi on her attention to detail. He made no suggestions and was certain that none of the others would be able to add value to Nidhi’s work. He was right. The CFO and CHRO too returned the document without any comments. Nidhi had to follow up thrice over the next ten days before she received the documents from the COO and the heads of consumer and commercial banking. They did not make any comments. The four firms were invited and briefed by Nidhi and given four weeks to respond with their presentations. The dates for presentations by the consulting firms had to be postponed thrice. Sometimes the COO had urgent client meetings and at other times, either of the two heads of consumer and commercial banking had last-minute crisis situations to deal with. For the first time in her career Nidhi felt exasperated and helpless. She sought the CHRO’s counsel. ‘Are these guys like this always or is it something to do with me?’ she asked the CHRO. ‘I don’t think it is anything to do with you. I just feel that if you had let the COO have his way in engaging his friend’s firm, you would have found things a bit different,’ said the CHRO. ‘Should I speak to the CEO and seek his intervention?’ ‘I don’t think that will help much. In the four years that I have been here, I have not seen the CEO ever confront the COO.’ ‘But he supported me in my suggestion on the shortlisting process.’ ‘Well, he did not really confront the COO. He only made a suggestion to support you as you were the new kid on the block.’ ‘So, what do you suggest I do?’ ‘Play up to the COO and his ego. Remember he knows that he cannot delay things beyond a point. All he is trying to do is makes things a bit difficult for you. Once he co-operates, the other two will soon fall in line.’ ‘But why pick on me? I am not competing with him.’ ‘I agree that under normal circumstances he would never see you as competition. But remember it was our chairman in the US who initiated this assignment. Everyone wants their share of visibility where the chairman is concerned. In my long career in human resources I find that it’s the senior folk who are the most insecure and crave more for such visibility.’ Nidhi had never thought of things this way. She had believed that if one was competent and performed one’s work with sincerity then that was all that mattered. She was now learning new aspects of human behaviour and interpersonal dynamics that were crucial to being successful. Nidhi followed the CHRO’s advice and new dates were set for presentations by the four contenders. Fortunately, this time, there were no postponements. One firm was finally shortlisted, but not the one suggested by the COO. At the same time, Nidhi was silently grateful that her previous employers were also not the ones finally selected. Things soon moved at a quick pace. The selected firm sent in their best consultant to work on the assignment. Nidhi was the single point of contact within the bank. It was decided that the concerned consultant would spend the first two weeks speaking with the top three layers within the bank’s hierarchy and to a few clients to map out current issues. He would then make an interim presentation to the leadership team and seek their inputs. Thereafter, the consultant would put together a suggested roadmap with clear, actionable steps. A date was also set for the final presentation in which the chairman would connect via a video-conference call. Every evening, Nidhi met the consultant and sought an update. Most meetings were going as per plan. The COO and the two heads of consumer and commercial banking were the only ones not able to spare sufficient time. Nidhi made sure that he CEO gave more of his time to make up for this. The consultant made his interim presentation on the scheduled date and received inputs from the leadership team. As planned, he then went back to his firm to work with others there and to prepare his final presentations. The next day, the CEO called for a meeting of the leadership team. ‘I think some of us are not too enthused with this exercise. I expected some more suggestions yesterday when the consultant presented his interim report,’ said the CEO. ‘If you want my honest opinion then I think the firm should have sent us someone more competent. Maybe we should ask them to change the person,’ said the COO. Two others in the room seemed to agree with him. Nidhi was tempted to ask him how he could arrive at this conclusion when he had hardly given the consultant sufficient time. But she held her peace and said instead, ‘In all my years in consulting, I have never come across nor heard of a situation where a client seeks a mid-course change of consultant. No firm will allow this. It will severely damage their reputation and diminish employee morale. I suggest we wait for the final recommendations that will be made with inputs from other senior people in the firm.’ The CEO agreed to this suggestion. Two weeks later, the day of reckoning arrived. The CEO and his leadership team were seated in the boardroom. The head of the consulting firm was also present. They were waiting for the chairman to call-in before the consultant would start his presentation. Soon, they were all set to go. The quality of the presentation was quite slick. The slides were well-designed and simple to comprehend. Some people in the room and the chairman often interjected during the presentation and Nidhi was happy to see the consultant answer with confidence and clarity. And then, she suddenly realized something that made her very nervous. The COO and the two heads of consumer and commercial banking, who were seated in a corner of the room, had not asked any questions. In fact, they were looking into their laptops most of the time and seemed to ignore the presentation altogether. She quickly scribbled something on a sticky note, got up, and excused herself for a few minutes, went around to the place where the COO and the other two were seated and walked over to the presenter and handed him the paper and said, ‘I have to make an urgent personal call. My new number is written here. Please call me in case you need me.’ When she returned a few minutes later, she noticed that all the three laptops had been closed and everyone was paying close attention. The presentation soon ended with some clear recommendations. The chairman sought views from the people present. The COO spoke first: ‘I think it was an excellent presentation and we must start implementation of the recommendations right away. I would, in fact, request the head of the consulting firm here to spare the services of this consultant for a few months more to help in the implementation.’ The other two immediately seconded this suggestion. The chairman too seemed happy and asked the CEO to work out the next steps. As everyone left the room, the CEO asked Nidhi to come over to his office. ‘Good show, Nidhi. But tell me, what did you write in that sticky note. Not your phone number I am sure?’ ‘Oh, that!’ smiled Nidhi. ‘During the meeting, when I saw the COO and the other two were quite indifferent to the presentation and busy with their laptops, it suddenly struck me that throughout the presentation the consultant only acknowledged inputs from you and me and failed to give credit to anyone else. I was worried that the COO and the other two may later shoot down all recommendations, and getting their buy-in was critical.’ ‘So, what was in that slip of paper?’ ‘I asked the consultant to stop quoting you and me and to just acknowledge the COO and the other two for everything,’ said Nidhi. The CEO looked at her with newfound pride!",

      "content": "8 Come Walk a Mile in My Shoes The 1980s witnessed a major inflection point in India’s automobile industry. Maruti Suzuki led the charge followed by the introduction of 100 cc Japanese motorcycles. The truck industry too saw licences being issued for the manufacture of Light Commercial Vehicles. Majority of these involved collaborations with Japanese automakers and it was only natural that the new entrants would look to attract talent from existing reputed truck manufacturer. There was no dearth of talent in retail sales. The situation was quite different when it came to hiring people to manage institutional sales where the number of experienced people was very low. So, it was no surprise that Divij, a well-respected auto industry professional, with a reputation of having successfully established the institutional sales function at two of India’s well-established truck brands, was sought by most of the new entrant companies. Following a period of protracted discussions with his prospective employers, Divij finally agreed to join one of these new players. Two factors influenced his decision – the opportunity to be exposed to world-class Japanese practices and a free hand to set up and grow the institutional sales function. He had made it clear to the CEO, who was from the car industry but with a background in retail selling: ‘Selling to institutions involves much longer sales cycles and the government departments, among our biggest customers, have their own well-set procurement processes. We need to have the patience to set realistic targets in this space.’ Divij joined as vice president and spent the next six months putting his team in place. Next, he met up with his existing network of customers to apprise them of his new position and the new offerings. The CEO seemed pleased with the progress in building the institutional sales function and said so during the sales review meeting. ‘Looks like everything is on track, Divij?’ ‘Yes, we have met all our milestones,’ said Divij. ‘Great. So, can I budget some number for your team?’ asked the CEO. ‘Give us another three months and we will take that on. Given the long duration involved in institutional sales, I suggest we set six-month targets,’ said Divij. ‘Sure,’ said the CEO and then made a surprise announcement. ‘I am moving on, and a new CEO has been identified.’ They had heard rumours, even so, it came as a shock. ‘What happened? This is going to impact us all in a big way,’ said the retail sales head. ‘I believe no one is indispensable. I don’t mean it as a cliché, but we have a great team here and we have made the transition to being process-driven from the early days when we were mainly people-driven. I am sure things will continue as they are, irrespective of who heads the company,’ said the CEO. Events moved fast. Arjun, the new CEO joined in a month’s time. Life continued for everyone except Divij. Unlike the earlier CEO, Arjun was more focused on immediate goals and expected the institutional sales team to carry monthly targets like the retail sales teams. He had no clue of the issues involved in this area and was not willing to listen to what Divij had to say. From then on, every monthly sales review meeting turned out to be nothing short of an inquisition for Divij – a period of prolonged and intensive questioning by Arjun as to why he was not meeting his targets. As Divij walked into the boardroom for one such review meeting, he said hello to the retail sales head and the other four regional sales heads already present there. Were those sympathetic looks or was it his imagination? Before he could find an answer, the door opened and Arjun breezed in, late for the first time. ‘Sorry I am late. The chairman summoned me. He is very upset that we have not met our targets.’ The retail sales head and regional heads made their presentations in quick succession. One of them had fallen short in meeting his targets. Arjun patiently listened and then offered some suggestions. He then turned to Divij: ‘Do you have some good news this time?’ ‘I was hoping that the state transport department would close that large order last month,’ said Divij. ‘This is the third consecutive quarter you have slipped up.’ ‘But Arjun, you know institutional sales are never predictable,’ said Divij. ‘Then how do our competitors always do better?’ shot back Arjun. ‘If we do not meet our targets this year, somebody will be looking for a job. And it won’t be me.’ Later that evening, as Divij sat in his office, he realized that, for the first time in his career, he would be a failure. Why could Arjun not realize that selling cycle for institutional sales was never the same as normal sales? There was nothing more frustrating than working with a boss who had no clue where your shoe pinched. The loud ringing of the phone on his table interrupted his thoughts. ‘Hi, Divij thought I would just call and say hello.’ It was his former boss. Sometimes coincidences can turn out to be providential. ‘Nice to hear from you! How are you doing?’ enquired Divij. ‘I am doing fine. You tell me, how are you doing?’ ‘Okay,’ said Divij. ‘Just came out of a sales review. No one here understands anything about institutional selling.’ ‘What happened?’ ‘My new boss expects me to meet month-on-month targets. He is quite considerate while dealing with the regional sales heads. But when it comes to institutional sales, he has zero patience. I feel humiliated at times,’ said Divij. He then went on to apprise his former boss of how the state transport department kept delaying its procurement decisions and how he was being blamed for it. ‘Divij, I don’t think your boss has ever handled institutional sales. The only way to make him appreciate your constraints is to make him empathize with you.’ ‘How do I do that? He is just not willing to listen to reason,’ said Divij. ‘I understand, Divij. Just make him walk some distance in your shoes. Believe me, he will then appreciate your constraints.’ ‘What exactly do you mean?’ asked Divij. ‘Why don’t you take him to your next meeting with the state transport department? Let him see how those guys work and the challenges you have to face.’ ‘How can I do that? You know how unpredictable and discourteous those guys are. They cancel meetings at the last minute. And there is not even a decent waiting place out there.’ ‘That is exactly my point. Let your boss experience what you go through and things will be much better. Trust me.’ Divij was quiet for a few seconds. ‘Okay, let me give it a shot. Thanks for your call. I feel much better now,’ said Divij As advised, Divij convinced Arjun that his presence was crucial at the next meeting with the transport department where a final decision was likely to be taken. ‘If the meeting with the transport secretary is scheduled for 10 a.m., why are we here at 9.15?’ asked Arjun, as the security staff stopped their car outside the government building. ‘We have to get down here and walk. It will take some time to have our entry passes made,’ said Divij, as he stepped out and waited for Arjun. They walked 100 metres towards the place where passes were issued. The long queue spilled out of the small room onto the road and the two of them looked quite overdressed in their suits and ties on that summer morning. It took thirty minutes for them to receive their passes and another walk of over fifty metres around the building to the waiting room. As they walked in, they found every chair and bench in the stuffy room already occupied by contractors and transporters. An antiquated ceiling fan struggled to keep the air circulating. Divij tried to make some space on one of the benches for Arjun, who preferred to remain standing. The hours passed. An assistant would periodically enter the room and ask a particular visitor to follow him. ‘Were we not supposed to see the transport secretary at 10 a.m.?’ asked an impatient Arjun. ‘That’s what I was told. I have informed his assistant that we are here. Now we wait to be called,’ said Divij. Another three hours passed before the assistant appeared to announce lunch break. ‘Sir will come back at 2 p.m.,’ he said, and walked away. Some snacks were available in a few run-down shacks set up along the pavements outside and away from the main gates. Divij took Arjun there. ‘You expect me to eat here? Don’t they have a canteen?’ Arjun asked. ‘They do, but only government employees eat there.’ ‘Why don’t we drive down to the market nearby and grab a quick bite?’ suggested Arjun. Divij advised against it as he was keen to get back before 2 p.m. They managed to share a soggy sandwich and get back to the waiting area. Around 3.30 p.m., the assistant ushered them into the transport secretary’s office. Arjun offered his business card, which the official did not so much as glance at. They remained standing while the official addressed Divij, ‘I don’t understand why you keep following up. I have told you that once we take a decision we will let you know. Your competitors have offered us eight per cent discount. I hope you understand what I am saying. Come back only if you can better that.’ Before either Divij or Arjun could say a word, he hit the button on the brass bell on his table. ‘Next!’ The same assistant showed them out. Neither of them spoke on their way back to office. Divij felt guilty for subjecting Arjun to this treatment and was worried about the repercussions. At the subsequent sales review meeting, Divij was pleasantly surprised to find Arjun very considerate towards him. ‘I know we weren’t able to make any headway on that order. That guy was asking for an unreasonable discount, which the chairman has clearly not approved. And Divij, the next time you go to such offices, you must carry some food from home. That was quite an experience!’ said Arjun. A part of Divij’s targets, that year, was allocated to other regional managers and the company met its sales targets.",

      "content": "9 The Door Closer The chairman rose slowly from his chair and leaned forward, towering over Nath, the short, rotund CEO seated across him. And as he stood there with fists closed tight and pressed against his mahogany desk top, he resembled a sumo wrestler about to attack. ‘I don’t care how you manage it, Nath, but I will not tolerate another strike or blackmail by that union leader at our complex in Bhopal,’ he hissed. ‘I will sort this out the moment I am back in Bhopal,’ said Nath. ‘This time you better keep your word. You made a similar promise three years ago and you know what happened. That nasty little union guy of yours, what’s his name … Debu … yes, that’s right, Debu. He called for that strike which lasted a full forty-two days. We lost a lot of money then.’ He continued in a raised voice: ‘And did you not tell me he had been taken care of then? Why are we now again expecting more trouble from him? You know we are right now in the midst of merger talks with one of the world’s largest chemicals companies and I don’t want anything or anyone to derail this.’ Nath made a feeble attempt to again assure his boss but was cut short. ‘You tell me he has aspirations to create a federation of unions across all our factories in India. That will be a disaster, I warn you. You must clip his wings as soon as possible.’ It’s not a pleasant sight to witness your boss, a powerful CEO in his own right, being hauled over the coals in your presence. I was aware that my presence in the room would make him uncomfortable and that I had to somehow assure him that nobody beyond the three of us would ever be privy to what transpired in that room that day. I had to do that quickly, but I had absolutely no idea how to do it. So I did the next best thing – I tried to make myself as invisible as possible. The chairman closed the meeting with a few placatory words, ‘I know you will not allow matters to go out of hand this time, Nath. Best wishes.’ As we exited his cabin through his EA’s room, there were three or four people there, waiting to see the chairman. How much had they heard? Since our flight to Bhopal was a good five hours away, Nath suggested, ‘Let’s stop by at one of the hotels at the aero city near the airport. I could do with a drink.’ ‘Good idea, sir,’ I said. We chose a corner table and ordered our drinks. ‘I saw you getting uncomfortable when the chairman lost his temper. For a moment, I thought you might leave the room,’ he said. ‘You are right, sir. I was very uncomfortable and wanted to step out. Then I realized that if I had opened the door, those waiting outside would hear the chairman. Those hydraulic door closers take their own sweet time in shutting the door completely.’ ‘I guess you’re right. And when people hear snippets of a conversation, without knowing the context fully, it gives rise to all kinds of rumours,’ he said. ‘By the way, I hope what happened in the chairman’s room remains there.’ I was tempted to respond with ‘What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas’. However, knowing he would not appreciate any sign of familiarity from my side, I quickly said, ‘Sure, sir. Please rest assured.’ I had joined Nath a year ago as vice president in his office. During this period, I had learnt many things about him, mostly through the old timers, who shared some stories about him. I learnt that he worked harder than everyone else at this huge, 800-acre fertilizers and chemicals complex, with its ten manufacturing plants, near Bhopal. He had his system of informers and loyalists and there was nothing he was not privy to. It was rumoured that even the trees within the campus stopped rustling if he was in station. ‘What’s your reading of Debu?’ he asked me. ‘I have just met him once or twice, sir. I think he is very intelligent and very convincing when he speaks. He is very ambitious and will stop at nothing. The other workers are aware that he has easy access to you. I also hear that every time he meets you, he gives them the impression that he’s always got the better of you,’ I said. ‘What do you think motivates him to be so disruptive on occasions?’ There was nothing that Nath did not know about Debu, but since he had asked me a question I had to answer and appear knowledgeable. ‘I heard that he was a brilliant student during his school days in Jamshedpur and was keen to pursue engineering. His father, who worked in a factory, was unable to help him pursue his dreams. He sent him to an industrial training institute located close by,’ I said. Nath filled in the rest, ‘I am also told that Debu believes that life is never fair and that one has to constantly fight for one’s rights. Now you know why I let him have his ego trips when he tells the others that he has had the better of me.’ It was time to leave for the airport. On the flight, my thoughts were about Debu. He had joined the company many years before me, as an apprentice in our captive power plant. A diligent worker with a sharp intellect, he seemed to have good influence over his co-workers and was soon elected president of the power plant workers’ union. Three years ago, he had rallied all the plant unions at the Bhopal complex in an attempt to form a single union. The management did not agree to this and Debu engineered a strike at the power plant, which effectively shut down the whole complex. The strike lasted forty-two days, causing immense financial loss to the company. After days of protracted negotiations, the management seemed to give in to most of Debu’s demands and he emerged as the president of the new combined association of unions. It was rumoured that Debu had also managed a few concessions for himself, but no one had any real evidence of this. As most of the negotiations had been carried out between Nath and Debu, the general perception was that Debu had won and Nath had lost. The next triennial agreement was coming up in six months and it was only natural for workers to expect bigger wage increases. Debu, meanwhile, had trained his sights on forming a federation of unions of all the group factories in India. This was what the chairman was alluding to. As the plane began its descent, I was curious to see how Nath would handle the situation. I did not have to wait long. Nath’s secretary informed me that the boss desired to see me the next morning at 7.30 a.m. Access to Nath’s office was through the secretary’s room, which, when I entered at the appointed time, was crowded. Debu was sitting on a two-seater sofa in the corner. Also present in the room were eight personal assistants of every plant manager in the complex. I peered through the small glass window on Nath’s door. He was on the phone. His secretary’s intercom soon buzzed, summoning me. I knocked on Nath’s door and entered. He was still on the phone and gestured for me to take the seat across the table. ‘Is Debu here?’ he asked me. ‘Yes, he is here.’ He buzzed for Debu and what happened next took me by complete surprise. The moment the door was pushed open by Debu, Nath addressed him in raised tones. ‘Who do you think you are, Debu? You drop my name everywhere and spread rumours. Don’t ever forget that you work for me. And if you do not behave yourself, we shall cancel that cement dealership given to your brother in Jamshedpur.’ Debu seemed shell-shocked. I could see his face darken with anger and I expected him to walk out any moment. I was hoping the door behind him would close faster. By then, every word uttered by Nath would have been heard by everyone in the other room. Once the door was fully closed, Nath’s voice softened. ‘Please sit down.’ He then picked up the intercom and spoke to his secretary, ‘Please inform all the others waiting there that I shall see them tomorrow.’ He then turned to Debu who remained standing and looked furious. ‘I don’t understand. Why did you shout at me like that, sir?’ he demanded. ‘Please sit down first. I am sorry, there are too many things bothering me today. By the way, tell me how is everything?’ Debu seemed to relax a bit and sat down. I remained a mere spectator while the two of them discussed what seemed to be mere trivialities, ranging from how his family was doing in Bengal to local politics. Tea and biscuits were served, helping prolong the discussion further. Forty-five minutes later, a smiling Debu shook hands and left the room. As I rose to leave, Nath said, ‘Keep your ear to the ground and let me know what you hear.’ When I left his room, I felt the door took more than its usual time to fully close behind me. Or was I imagining it? The phone on my desk started ringing even before I could sit down. ‘You were there with Nath this morning. What happened with Debu?’ It was the fertilizer plant manager. ‘Nothing much really. They just had a pleasant chat,’ I said. ‘Then why has the union called for a special meeting?’ ‘I’m not aware of that. Please excuse me as I have some urgent reports to submit right now. I will call you soon,’ I said and put the phone down. I then called up some colleagues working at the other plants in the complex. They confirmed the news about the union calling for an urgent meeting. A week later, Debu stepped down as president of the union. And the new president was a more grounded person and had no aspirations to form a federation of all our unions. Nath called me into his room the next day. ‘Finally, this whole unpleasant matter seems to have been resolved. And, to some extent, you helped me resolve this. Thank you,’ he said with a smile. As I left his room, I noticed that the door took more than its usual time to fully shut. A simple hydraulic door closer had provided closure to a long-festering problem.",

      "content": "10 Policy or People? The caller ID on his mobile showed ‘Tat Savitur’. Of all the unique names that Ravi had come across, this one ranked right up there in terms of intrigue value. Ravi promised himself that one day he would ask his CEO how he got this name. He picked up his phone and said, ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘It’s been over three months since my secretary left and I have received no replacement yet. If this is how your hiring team deals with my requirements, I dread to think what they must be doing to others in this company,’ said Tat Savitur. ‘If you are free, can I see you now?’ Ravi said, aware that he had to dispel any wrong notions that the CEO may have formed about him and his team. ‘Yes, come over.’ As he walked towards Tat Savitur’s cabin, he made a quick call to his head of hiring. ‘What’s the latest on Tat Savitur’s secretary? I am on my way to his office.’ ‘We are on it, Ravi. In the last two months we interviewed twenty candidates and he has rejected all of them. I wonder if he knows what he is looking for because, by now, we have no idea. Please don’t tell him that! Merely tell him we are lining up more candidates.’ ‘I don’t think this meeting is going to be an easy one. I suspect he has already formed an opinion that we all are quite ineffective. I asked to see him to prevent any more damage to our reputation.’ ‘Any update for me?’ asked Tat Savitur with a serious look as Ravi came into his room. ‘My hiring team tells me you rejected twenty candidates in the last two months,’ said Ravi. ‘They feel it’s easier to find you a rocket scientist,’ said Ravi. ‘Jokes apart, Ravi, I urgently need that secretary. Not one of those candidates made the cut. There are too many things lined up and our IPO is round the corner.’ ‘I can assure you that my hiring team is working hard to fill this vacancy.’ ‘But that’s surely not working. Maybe they need to work smart and not hard.’ ‘To be fair to them, my hiring team is confused and seem to be hitting a wall. The more candidates we reject the more difficult the task becomes. Word spreads in the market.’ ‘I can’t help it if they don’t find me the right candidate.’ ‘We did find a candidate whom you liked. But then that person demanded a higher CTC, which you refused.’ ‘You guys know that I am always against bending the rules for anyone. I believe this is something we should never do. After all, rules are the very foundation on which organizations are built and sustained.’ ‘I know. Maybe it will help if you tell us what exactly are you looking for in a candidate? After all, a secretary is just another secretary.’ ‘I must admit that most of the candidates did possess the requisite secretarial skills. What I am looking for is that special kind of maturity where the person has little need to use information as power.’ ‘Sorry, it’s not clear to me,’ I said. ‘As an HR professional, I am sure you know that every individual has a need for power. A few acquire legitimate power by virtue of their position and designation. And there are those who seek it through their proximity to power centres or through the information they have access to. My secretary will be privy to a lot of confidential information and I want a person who knows how to handle this.’ ‘Okay, that makes a lot more sense now. Rest assured we will fill this position soon.’ ‘We should have had this discussion a long time ago,’ said Tat Savitur, laughing. More interviews were set up and finally, Tat Savitur found the person he was looking for. Sometimes things just fall into place. Mukherjee used to work as a secretary with a company in Kolkata. His boss, transferred to Delhi three years ago, had insisted that he too move with him. Mukherjee rented a two-bedroom flat in one of the societies in the trans-Yamuna region. His wife, their school-going daughter, and his widowed mother stayed with him. To his misfortune, his company shut all operations three months ago. Not wanting to disrupt his daughter’s education, Mukherjee decided against returning to Kolkata and resolved to look for a job in Delhi NCR. Things were looking bad for Mukherjee. Very few companies were in need of a secretary. He was willing to consider any role in the administration function too. And even in that domain, nothing seemed to be happening. His savings were getting depleted and to make matters worse, the landlord, who had not been paid for over a month, had served them a notice. His wife had started giving tuitions at home but her income was just enough to put food on the table. His mother contributed in her own way – every day she was at the nearby temple. Durga Puja was forty-five days away and she knew that her goddess would show them a way out of their misery. And then Mukherjee received the offer letter from Ravi. Tat Savitur was delighted to have finally found an extremely efficient and mature secretary. He referred to him as his ‘devil’s advocate’ – someone who kept him honest, and escalated matters in time. With the IPO planned in the coming year, a consulting firm was hired to develop the roadmap for growth. Tat Savitur kept long hours and was happy to see that Mukherjee often stayed back late. One day, Mukherjee walked into Tat Savitur’s room and placed his leave application in front of him. ‘What? You want a month off? You know there is so much going on here and you have been here barely a month. The consulting firm will make their presentation in three weeks and then we have the road shows in the four metros,’ said a visibly upset Tat Savitur. ‘I know, sir, but it’s for Durga Puja. In-between I can come for a couple of days,’ replied Mukherjee. ‘When is Durga Puja?’ ‘October 11th to 15th.’ ‘Then take that week off.’ ‘It’s Durga Puja, sir,’ said Mukherjee, with a surprised look on his face. ‘Why do you look surprised? If anyone has to be surprised it has to be me.’ ‘I am surprised that you do not know why I am surprised.’ ‘Hope there’s no strategy here, Mukherjee. What are you really trying to say?’ ‘You know how important Durga Puja is for us, sir.’ Tat Savitur had always believed Durga Puja was a very big festival only in Kolkata. Having been in Delhi for just over a year, he had no idea of how big the festival was there too. ‘Are you planning to go to Kolkata?’ ‘My family is here. I will be in Delhi.’ ‘If you are not going to Kolkata, why do you want a month’s leave?’ ‘I am the convener for Durga Puja in my locality.’ ‘What does that mean?’ ‘There are hundreds of puja pandals all over Delhi. In each locality the people contribute money, and various events and celebrations are held. Theatre is one of the biggest draws. I am the director for the plays and hence need to be away for a month.’ ‘But you know there is so much to do here.’ ‘It’s only for a month. And I will make up for lost time when I am back.’ ‘Even if I want to say yes, you have no leave to your credit.’ ‘Since you are the CEO, sir, I am sure you can sanction me a month’s advance leave,’ suggested Mukherjee. ‘You know the rules do not permit that, especially for someone who is just a month old here,’ said Tat Savitur, convinced that the matter was settled. Mukherjee walked out of Tat Savitur’s office saying he would be back in a moment. He returned a few minutes later and placed another sheet of paper in front of Tat Savitur. It was his hand-written letter of resignation. ‘What’s this, Mukherjee? Do you know what you are doing?’ Mukherjee politely nodded his head. ‘You said you have your widowed mother, your wife, and your child to take care of. Why aren’t you thinking of them?’ asked a visibly upset Tat Savitur. Mukherjee stood there mute, like a statue. ‘When I hired you, don’t you recollect that you had been unemployed for nearly three months? You know that the economy is not particularly good right now and jobs are not easy to come by. You could remain unemployed for a longer period.’ Tat Savitur was sure that this would make him see some sense. Mukherjee’s response was enigmatic, ‘I also recall you telling me, sir, that it took you over two months to find me.’ ‘So?’ ‘I will be away only for a month and going by the history here, you will not find my replacement that soon. I shall come back and again apply for the job.’ Tat Savitur stared at Mukherjee not believing what he had just heard. Suddenly, he laughed aloud when he realized the irony of the situation. He picked up the leave application, ‘Okay, let me talk to HR and see what I can do.’ Tat Savitur spoke with Ravi the next day and narrated what had transpired between him and Mukherjee. Ravi found it difficult to stop laughing. ‘I like that man’s guts. I tell you, he is a real asset to us. I suggest let’s grant him a month’s leave in advance, as a special case. He will truly appreciate this gesture,’ said Tat Savitur. Ravi did not want to let go of the opportunity to mildly confront his CEO on his decision to bend the rules. ‘Aren’t we bending some rules here?’ he asked. ‘I know. One of the reasons I never bend any rules is that others often cite that as a precedent. But I think Mukherjee has a valid point. Let’s make some changes to our leave policy for employees and incorporate this new clause to be used only in special cases.’ ‘And who will decide if a case is special?’ ‘That’s why you are the HR head here, Ravi. You and your team figure that out,’ said Tat Savitur with a laugh. ‘Sure, will do. And, by the way, I think all our employees now owe thanks to Mukherjee,’ said Ravi. Mukherjee had managed to do what HR failed to do for so many years – make Tat Savitur take a U-turn on company policy.",

      "content": "11 When the Comfort Zone Makes Strategic Sense What had started off as whispers was now being openly spoken about by his divisional heads. Not all of them yet, but five out of the six. It was time for him to do something about it. Udith was the CEO of a large conglomerate with six manufacturing locations spread over six northern states in India. A divisional general manager (DGM) headed each location. Over the past few weeks, five of his DGMs had separately spoken to him on how they felt that their finance heads were more loyal to Jain, the corporate finance head, who reported to Udith. Nothing wrong with that, really, as these guys did have a dotted line reporting into Jain. What bothered them was that lately, Jain would often be the first one to know whenever things went wrong under their command, even before they themselves were told about it. And Jain had a knack of raising these issues with Udith without double-checking with the DGMs first, and they looked unprepared and cut a sorry figure whenever Udith chose to speak with them on these issues. Udith decided to get the views of his corporate human resource officer (CHRO) Bipin before discussing this with Jain. ‘The DGMs seem to be uncomfortable that their finance guys appear to be very close to Jain,’ said Udith. ‘Yes, they have voiced these concerns to me too in confidence,’ said Bipin. ‘Oh, really? How long has this been going on?’ ‘Well, off and on. In fact, some of them have accused these guys of spying for Jain.’ ‘That’s a serious accusation,’ said Udith, raising his eyebrows. ‘What bothers them is that Jain then uses this information to make them look bad in your eyes and, more so, during the quarterly board meetings,’ said Bipin. Bipin, however, chose not to share with Udith that the DGMs were equally concerned about Udith’s knee-jerk reactions every time Jain shared such information with him. ‘Do you think those finance guys really spy for Jain?’ ‘I don’t think so. But I know that Jain asks those guys to bring to his notice any wrongdoing they observe in their respective divisions. And since they all are CAs handpicked by him, they believe they owe their allegiance to him.’ ‘Five of our six DGMs have expressed these concerns to me and we must do something about it,’ said a concerned Udith. ‘I agree,’ said Bipin. ‘Why don’t we move some of these finance heads to other functions as part of our leadership development policy and get some new guys who are non – CAs in their place?’ said Udith thinking that he had found a solution. ‘Difficult in this case. You know Jain hires only chartered accountants like himself and believes that these are career finance people and do not need cross functional exposure.’ ‘Why not hire some folk with an MBA to head the finance function in our divisions? We can surely move them around later.’ ‘You know that’s like a red rag to Jain. He has an intense dislike for MBAs, and thinks that all they do is make presentations and talk about everything with expertise in nothing.’ ‘So, you are saying we are helpless?’ ‘On the contrary, I think that right now we may have a slight opportunity. Our finance guy in Indore resigned last month and we are interviewing candidates. There is one applicant, a smart person with an MBA, but I have not passed him on to Jain.’ ‘Let me meet him. This could be our chance.’ ‘I am okay as long as you manage Jain,’ said Bipin, smiling. The following week, Udith interviewed Shishir, the candidate with an MBA degree. Little did Shishir know that he would soon be the main actor in an intense drama! Jain argued vehemently that Shishir did not make the cut but Udith logically countered his every objection. Jain finally gave in, knowing that there was only a point up to which one could resist the boss. At the same time, Jain was sure that he would be the one to write the last act in this script. Over the next one year, Shishir settled in well and got along with his peers. The DGM at Indore was delighted to have him on his team and often sought his views on matters that were beyond the purview of the finance function. Shishir too felt good that his views were being solicited and was happy that he had joined this place. If anything bothered him, it was the nagging feeling that Jain was not too favourably disposed towards him. On one of his trips to the corporate office, Shirish decided to speak with CHRO, Bipin, with whom he had developed a trust relationship, and seek his advice. ‘What does Jain have against me?’ asked Shishir. ‘What makes you feel this way?’ asked Bipin.. ‘Initially, I thought I was imagining things. Then I noticed that during the divisional review meetings, where you too have been present, he picks up insignificant errors in the documents prepared by me and tends to blow them out of proportion.’ Bipin had indeed noticed this. In fact, he had also observed that Jain would wait for Shishir to take his seat and then take a place diagonally opposite away and across from Shishir. ‘I think you are possibly imagining some of these things. I don’t think Jain has anything against you,’ said Bipin, trying to sound convincing. ‘Do you recall the review meeting held four months ago? Jain picked up such an inconsequential error and raised his voice and addressed me. And before I could reply, you heard Udith say, “If the assumptions are themselves wrong then this meeting is a waste of time.” I am grateful that my DGM stepped in and sorted it out. But if this continues, just imagine what Udith will think of me.’ To Bipin, it was clear that Shishir was caught in a crossfire for no fault of his own. Jain was focused on proving him a failure, and thus settling his debate with Udith that CAs were more competent and trustworthy than MBAs. Shishir interrupted his thoughts, ‘Does Jain have anything against MBAs?’ ‘I don’t think so. But why do you ask?’ ‘The other day, when I submitted a report to him, he said that I lacked attention to detail. He then quickly said that had I been a CA, it would not have happened.’ ‘I am sure he said that without meaning it.’ ‘Yes, I know. That does not bother me as much as the way he shouts across the room pointing out small errors during the review meeting. That gives me nightmares. And the next review is just a month away,’ said a visibly upset Shishir. Bipin realized that if nothing was done soon, they might lose Shishir. And as if reading his mind, Shishir spoke, ‘Honestly, I sometimes think I may be better off taking another job. I know Jain does not like me but I have no clue why. I have a dotted line reporting into him and his opinion on me will be important when my performance review comes up.’ To Bipin it was clear that if Shishir quit then that would be the last time the company could hire an MBA in finance. Udith would lose and Jain, who would see this as a clear victory, could become unmanageable in the future. ‘Okay, let’s for a moment agree that what you are feeling is true. What is the guarantee that you will not be faced with a similar situation wherever you go? Remember, the higher one is in the organization hierarchy, the greater the degree of ambiguity that one has to deal with,’ said Bipin. ‘I can see where you are going. If I can surmount this problem here then that would be a great learning for me. I also know that at our levels, if we keep changing jobs too soon, the market does not see it favourably,’ said Shishir. ‘Would you like me to broach this subject with Jain?’ asked Bipin feeling relieved. ‘No, please don’t. If you do that he will know I have spoken with you. Let me try and figure this out. If I need help, I will reach out to you,’ said Shishir. ‘Sounds like a plan,’ replied Bipin. He badly wanted Shishir to overcome the situation. That would open the door to many more MBAs joining the finance functions and help relieve the stress faced by the DGMs. Shishir did not know it, but a lot depended on him. ‘And, by the way, thank you for listening to me. I already feel unburdened,’ said Shishir as he shook hands and walked out of Bipin’s room. The impending review meeting continued to haunt Shishir till one day when his prayers were suddenly answered. Of all the unlikely places, it happened at a branch of the public sector bank where he held his account. In order to kill time while waiting for the cashier to call out his token number, he moved over to chat with the security guard. He was a tall, strapping person in his early fifties who looked like an ex-service man. Two things caught his eye – the thick bushy moustache that extended six inches on either side of his nose and the large, single-barrel gun slung over his broad shoulder. Actually, three things caught the eye if one included the bandolier filled with shells that was looped across his chest, forming an ‘X’ with the gun’s sling. ‘Are you an ex-serviceman?’ enquired Shishir, trying to strike up a conversation. ‘Yes sir, army,’ replied the security guard. ‘This gun must be very different from the one you used in the army.’ The guard laughed and said, ‘No comparison. But it is the best I have.’ ‘The bank gave you this weapon?’ ‘No, it is mine. This job is only offered to those who have a licensed gun,’ said the guard. Shishir decided to have some fun, ‘What if someone came close to you and pressed a pocket knife into your waist? How will this gun help?’ The other guy gave a sheepish grin, exposing tobacco-stained teeth. ‘Ha, ha … then this gun is useless. I will politely request the person to move at least six feet away, from out of my comfort zone into the kill zone, so that I can threaten him with the gun.’ They laughed together and then the cashier called out Shishir’s token number. As he was collecting his cash, Shishir had an epiphany. The safest place for anyone was to be within three feet of the security guard, within the comfort zone. Shishir was quite relaxed as the review date drew close. The corporate and the divisional teams exchanged pleasantries as they walked into the boardroom and made themselves comfortable on either side of the 25-feet-long table. Bipin observed that Jain kept waiting for Shishir to take his place at one corner and then walked to a seat diagonally across. As everyone opened the folders placed in front, Bipin gave a bemused smile as he saw Shishir collect his papers and move across and take a seat next to Jain. ‘Should you not be on the other side with your team?’ enquired Jain in a slightly raised voice. ‘I thought that, since I have a dotted line reporting to you sir, it’s important that I be available to answer any queries that you may have.’ Udith, who was seated nearby, overheard the conversation and addressed Jain, ‘I agree with Shishir. The divisional finance head must be seated next to you. Let’s implement this in our other locations too when we have reviews there.’ As always, during the first thirty minutes of the meeting, Jain was quiet and kept looking for errors in the documents given to him. Suddenly he noticed something out of place and pulled out his red marker and circled it. Shishir, whose eyes were on Jain all the while, moved his head slightly towards him and whispered, ‘That’s a small typing error, sir.’ And so it went on throughout the meeting. Every time Jain drew a circle over something, Shishir moved towards him and whispered something. He was within the comfort zone! Bipin kept smiling as this sideshow unfolded. He looked relieved and thought, ‘Round one to the MBA!’",

      "content": "12 The Smartest Appraisal Meeting Arshad was quite fed up. Why did Ron always leave his appraisal till the last hour? Was he trying to give him a message? It was nearing 7 p.m. that Friday evening in Noida and Arshad knew it would be another long evening as he slowly made his way to the MD’s office. If only their roles could be reversed, for just once, he could tell Ron what he actually thought of him. This would be his third appraisal review with Ron. He had been rated average over the last two years and he expected no better this year too. With Ron you could never expect anything better, especially if you were in a support function. Ron had spent over three decades in marketing in different regions across the globe. Three years ago, the US-based parent company had sent him to India to head the development centres here. For Ron, support functions existed only for one reason – to support. The secretary had left for the day and the offices were virtually empty, barring the pantry boy who usually stayed behind till Ron left for the day. Arshad pushed the door open after knocking on it softly. Ron was waiting for him. ‘Thank you for coming, Arshad. I know it’s pretty late but I’m keen to get your appraisal done today.’ Moving a stack of papers on his desk aside, he continued, ‘In fact, you are the last of all my executive team members to be appraised.’ Arshad, who was the head of HR & Facilities, took a seat and chose not to say anything at this stage. He knew that Ron, who loved to talk, would soon ask the questions and answer them too. Ron pulled out a few sheets from a file and began reading from them, ‘Hmm … I see that employee attrition has been contained.’ Arshad sat up straight, feeling good that the discussions had started on a positive note. ‘But then, I guess that all the functional heads should get equal credit for this,’ continued Ron. Arshad would have loved to give a curt response. Instead, he said, ‘I agree on that, Ron, but had I not worked closely with all of them, I don’t think we would have achieved this.’ Ron gave a patronizing smile, ‘At your level, Arshad, I am sure you do not expect me to just reward you on how well you co-ordinate things here. Can we talk a bit more about the strategic HR initiatives that you and your team are supposed to be putting in place?’ It was obvious that the pit bull, tenacious as always, was clamping his jaws tight. Whenever Ron used vague words like ‘strategic HR’ Arshad knew he was treading on thin ice. Once the discussions turned subjective, the boss would always win. To try and present any arguments now would be akin to fighting a crocodile in water. All that remained then would be the reptile’s death roll. It was clear that Ron had made up his mind and was bent on giving him the usual ‘average’ rating again. Arshad wondered if he should give in early or pretend to have a stab at it, even though the outcome seemed predictable. Ron loved to win. And he loved it more when his adversary put up a fight. It left him in a good mood while his adversary could land a few punches himself. Arshad decided to put up a tough fight initially and later concede defeat. As he prepared to defend, the intercom on Ron’s desk came to life. The security guard was calling from the gate. Some unexpected visitors were demanding to see Ron. Ron passed on the instrument to Arshad. ‘Who are these guys who want to see me at this time?’ he wondered. ‘Arshad here. Let me speak with them. Who? Two local politicians and they are already on their way up?’ Ron, who was listening to the conversation, looked very upset. There goes my appraisal, thought Arshad, as he said to Ron, ‘Let me handle this.’ A minute or so later, the two politicians were ushered into the room by a security person who seemed to show more deference towards them than to Ron or Arshad. Arshad and Ron stood up to receive the unwelcome guests. Ron, a big man by any standards, suddenly felt dwarfed by the man-mountain in white, who stood in front of him with folded hands. He appeared to be smiling but his thick moustache covered that completely. Like a turtle with a retracted neck, his large bullet-shaped head seemed to rest in the space between his broad shoulders. He was surely over six feet tall. Or taller, if one were to add his invisible neck. Arshad christened him Turtle. The other person with Turtle mercifully had a small build and was fidgety with eyes forever darting around. He reminded Arshad of a mouse, and that became his name. Arshad took charge of the situation. He asked the guests to be seated on the sofa in the corner of the office, and ordered the pantry boy to get the usual tea and biscuits. ‘Good evening, sir, sorry to disturb you so late, but we have to cover all companies in Noida in the next two days,’ said Turtle, getting straight to business. ‘No issue at all. What can we do for you?’ said Ron, trying to be as polite as possible. Before moving to India from the US, Ron had been briefed about these local politicians. ‘Be polite and show courtesy whenever you meet them. Their utility value may be limited, but don’t ever underestimate their nuisance value. Forewarned is forearmed,’ he had been told. Turtle gestured to Mouse, ‘Give them their receipt.’ Mouse quickly produced a pad and tore off a sheet and handed it to Arshad who looked at it, and passed it on to Ron. It was a pre-signed receipt for donation of ten lakh rupees, made out to Turtle’s local fund. ‘What is this about?’ asked Ron, avoiding eye contact with Turtle. He directed his question at Mouse. Turtle looked offended and placed his large palm on Mouse’s thigh, a signal for him to keep quiet. ‘This land, on which all the ten buildings occupied by your company stand, was once owned by the villagers here. Your companies take away our land but cannot provide employment to our youth because they are not qualified. We know you cannot employ them, so we will not force you. However, we still need to rehabilitate our young men. So, I am starting a fund for this and all companies are making generous contributions.’ Pausing for breath, Turtle continued, ‘I understand that your company has 12,000 employees and fifteen offices all over the world. So, we feel you can easily afford this amount. In fact, smaller companies are giving much more than this.’ Ron was flabbergasted. None of those pre-departure seminars had prepared him for this. Sensing Ron’s discomfiture, Arshad seized the initiative and addressed Turtle directly. ‘You must be aware that we are a subsidiary of an American company. There is a law in America called The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If our company gives any donations, however small, then Mr Ron Hector, our MD here, and his boss in America will both be sent to prison.’ ‘You must be joking. Do you think we are that stupid to believe you? Tell them how much money we have already collected,’ Turtle said, turning to Mouse and asked him to show copies of receipts made out to other donors. Arshad interjected before things could get out hand. ‘I know you would have got donations from many companies, but none of them will be American companies. You may check your receipt books if you so like.’ Mouse moved closer to Turtle and whispered through clenched teeth, ‘I think he is right, boss.’ All he got in return was a glare. Turtle was unwilling to give up so easily. He continued, ‘I saw your Jaguar parked below. You can afford such expensive cars but cannot give any money for our youth?’ He had a challenging gleam in his eye as he looked at Ron directly. ‘That is not his own car,’ Arshad said calmly, ‘It was given to him by the company and will be taken back by the company later.’ Ron’s head kept moving between Arshad and Turtle. Turtle was now getting very upset. ‘We are not asking you for cash. We are giving you a proper receipt, so what is the problem? You mean to say such a big man like him cannot take such a small decision?’ he addressed his last remark to Arshad. Arshad had an answer ready, and he stepped in for the kill. ‘You are right. He may be the MD of this company but the truth is that he really has no powers. All decisions are taken in America.’ Turtle vehemently shook his head indicating that he believed none of this. ‘I know this sounds silly but it’s the truth. If I were to say that he has to check with his bosses in America before going to the toilet here, even that would be no exaggeration.’ Ron was listening to everything that was being said and he was less than amused. Arshad was definitely beginning to enjoy himself. Turtle, however, was still sceptical. ‘You cannot fool me. I know that when it is morning here, it is night in America. Does he keep waking up his bosses throughout the night to get decisions?’ It was an enlightened Turtle now, thought Arshad. ‘Good point. You see, mostly he postpones decisions till he can get instructions from there. But if there is an urgent decision, then he will take that after second-guessing his bosses in America. Later on, he will get the decision ratified.’ Listening to Arshad’s assessment of his role, Ron felt terrible. He knew that Arshad was genuinely attempting to extricate him from a delicate situation but surely, he could be a bit less brutal? Turtle threw up his hands and stood up, completely exasperated. He seemed furious. All his plans for the million rupees seemed to be vaporising into thin air. Damn the US government and damn this impotent MD! His face grew red and he seemed to be groping for the right words. As if on cue, the pantry boy walked in with the now-forgotten cups of tea. That seemed to be the last straw. ‘Take the bloody tea away!’ said Turtle in disgust, ‘This big-shot MD with an expensive Jaguar cannot even take the smallest of decisions! I pity him. I am sure tomorrow he will have to get this tea approved by his bosses in America. Let us spare him the agony. Let’s not waste our time here anymore. And if they want to have some free tea they are welcome to my office!’ He seemed thrilled at having had the last word. Mouse quickly ran forward and opened the door as Turtle stormed out of the room. Arshad accompanied them to the main door, but his presence was not even acknowledged. Arshad walked back into Ron’s room, a triumphant look on his face. If that wasn’t a shining example of his ability to strategically manage a situation using his people skills, then what was? The arrival of those politicians was surely well-timed. ‘Shall we continue with my appraisal, Ron?’ Ron was feeling quite exhausted. ‘It’s late, Arshad. Let’s do it another day. And thanks for getting rid of those two gentlemen.’ ‘You are welcome, Ron. And good night.’ Arshad walked out of the room, trying to suppress a smile. He felt fairly certain that his competent handling of the situation would give Ron something to think about. In any case, the experience of being able to say all those things about Ron while he was present in the room had been entirely worth it! ‘Good night, Arshad.’ Ron’s voice seemed distant. That night, Ron tossed around in his bed for a long time. Something was bothering him. Was it the way Arshad reduced him to a non-entity? Or was it because there was an undeniable grain of truth in what Arshad said? Either way, Ron knew he was going to have to carefully re-evaluate his previous assessment of Arshad.",

      "content": "13 Nowhere to Hide Rajendra Narula, or RN as he preferred to be addressed, oversaw corporate affairs and the sales & marketing functions at India’s largest tyre company. He was a tall man with a pronounced paunch and walked with a slight stoop. His eyes were deep-set, mostly half-closed that made him look like an absent-minded professor. He was anything but that. He had a sharp memory and could recall complete details of past discussions and events with frightening clarity. You never challenged him on facts. And if you crossed him, he remembered it and made sure you always paid the price. He knew what was going on in every other department and created the perception that he influenced one’s career, whether one reported to him or not. Moorthy, who had recently joined the company as head of R&D and quality control, met Narula as part of his induction. ‘You know, Moorthy, I was away the day you were interviewed by our CEO. Later when he sought my views on your resume, I did tell him that you would be an asset here. Welcome to our company!’ Moorthy knew Narula was lying. His appointment letter had been signed and given to him by the CEO immediately at the end of that interview. He played along, though. ‘I appreciate that, Mr Narula. Thank you!’ ‘Please call me RN,’ said Narula, with a grin. It was only then that Moorthy noticed the large photograph of a guru on the wall behind him. RN’s grin bore a strong resemblance to the beatific smile in the photograph. Every organization has its share of war stories and Moorthy soon learnt that in this company, most of the war stories centred around RN. One such story had its beginning when one of his subordinates had corrected him on some facts during his presentation to the board. RN did not sack that particular person – that would be too easy and painless. He created situations where that person felt humiliated day in and day out. The poor guy quit in a month’s time. The CEO held his regular review meetings with his direct reportees once a month, and it was an unwritten rule at these meetings that they would avoid negative comments on each other’s functional areas. RN was the only person who breached this rule. In one such meeting, the CEO expressed grave concern that the warranty costs on tyres had doubled from two per cent to four per cent of sales and this impacted the bottom line in a big way. RN was quick to blame Moorthy: ‘Over the past few months our quality standards have dropped drastically. And if this continues, I am afraid the warranty costs will only go up further.’ Three months earlier, RN had made some major changes in the company’s warranty policy where dealers were now empowered to replace tyres free of cost, subject to some limits. As per the previous policy, all warranty cases had to be cleared by the quality control department. It was evident to Moorthy that the main cause of the problem was these policy changes, but he had no intention of confronting RN. Some of the others present in that room knew that the real problem lay in the warranty policy. Moorthy was a diligent technocrat and he would not have let the quality standards get diluted. It was also clear to them, and to Moorthy, as to who would go down at the end of this episode. The CEO turned towards Moorthy, ‘Please have a look at our quality processes. Each day’s delay costs us a lot of money. Even our board is very worried and wants us to stop bleeding at once.’ ‘I will personally monitor this right away,’ said Moorthy. Moorthy sought some time from the CEO immediately after the review meeting. ‘I did not want to raise it in the meeting, but I think the real problem is the changes made by RN in the warranty policy,’ Moorthy told him and went on to apprise the CEO on how this impacted warranty costs. ‘Let me talk with RN,’ said the CEO, well aware of the reasons why Moorthy chose not to confront RN. The CEO spoke with RN who responded, ‘Our warranty policy is in line with what our competitors offer. If we do not offer that, we will lose sales.’ ‘How come the warranty costs of our competitors continue to be around two per cent?’ asked the CEO. ‘That’s exactly my point,’ replied RN. ‘Obviously, their quality has not dropped.’ ‘In any case, why don’t you have a look at the policy?’ suggested the CEO. RN insisted that the problem was with quality. ‘Why don’t we have Moorthy report to me for the next six months and I will fix the problem,’ said RN, quite certain that it was Moorthy who had spoken to the CEO about the holes in the warranty policy. ‘I am sure Moorthy will soon have things under control,’ said the CEO and closed the discussion. Moorthy called his team and briefed them on what had transpired in the meeting, and instructed them to quickly check for any breach in the quality processes. While his team agreed to this, each one of them was convinced that the real problem was in the way the warranty policy had been changed. Some even went to the extent of suggesting that there could be some kind of connivance between RN and the dealers. Moorthy ignored that. As the employees moved out of his room, one stayed back. He had early worked in sales and RN had wanted him to be sacked. On HR’s request, Moorthy had agreed to his transfer to the quality department. ‘I think I know what is going on in the sales department,’ said the employee. Moorthy let him speak; what he heard was quite alarming yet seemed quite plausible. He appreciated the employee’s concerns and at the same time cautioned him against talking about something for which he had no evidence. Moorthy wondered whether to inform the CEO about what he had just heard. He knew that the CEO rarely confronted RN. Even if he did on this occasion, he would quote Moorthy. The consequences would be disastrous for him. At the same time, if the allegations were true and if nothing was done, it would continue to hurt the company in a big way. As he continued to mull over his dilemma, there was a knock on his door and the CFO walked in and sat down on the sofa. ‘Why did you not confront RN?’ he asked. Moorthy laughed and said, ‘You know why!’ ‘Obviously I know, but I think RN has bigger plans. I was just talking with the CEO. I believe RN wanted you and your function to report to him and he has said he will solve the problem at once.’ ‘And what did the CEO say?’ asked a worried Moorthy. ‘Of course, no way that is happening. But I did not come here to alarm you, Moorthy. Just to warn you that RN will stop at nothing.’ RN had made his intentions clear but to take him on would not be easy. As the CFO exited, Moorthy looked around the room as if looking for an answer on what he could do. As if in response, the words of one of his teachers came back to him at that moment. ‘It’s easy to be virtuous when the stakes are low. But it takes real courage to stand on the side of truth when everything of yours is at risk.’ He sought a meeting with RN. ‘Good afternoon, RN. I am getting our quality standards audited and this will take another week or so. However, I still do think that our warranty policy is a bit too liberal and that could be the real problem,’ said Moorthy. ‘Why are we discussing this again, Moorthy? Did the CEO not make it clear that the problem lay with our quality processes? I suggest you just focus on getting that audit done. I am sure that once you set that right, our product quality will improve and the warranty costs would soon be back to normal level,’ said RN with a dismissive tone. ‘RN, the CEO never said that quality is the problem. All he suggested was that we first review our existing processes and I have initiated steps for this,’ said Moorthy. ‘Then let’s wait for the report before jumping to any other conclusions,’ said RN and turned towards his computer as if to suggest that the meeting was over. It was now or never. ‘In fact, the main reason I came to see you was to talk to you about the rumours I have heard about you,’ said Moorthy. RN sat up straight. ‘What do you mean?’ he demanded with his voice raised. Moorthy took a long breath. ‘I have been hearing these things for quite some time and have been wanting to share them with you. There is some talk going around that there was this occasion when we had to fly to Mumbai to interview some sales candidates and that you had HR shift the venue to Chennai so that you could attend your guru’s convention there.’ Moorthy pointed to the large photo hanging on the wall behind RN. ‘And not to mention the additional costs that the company had to bear for the to-and-fro flights between Mumbai and Chennai for twenty candidates.’ The silence in the room was deafening. Moorthy tried to hide his fear. At the same time, RN tried to feign anger but it was clear that he was very worried. Moorthy soon realized that there was some truth in what he had just said and decided to drive home his advantage. He mustered some more courage and continued, ‘By the way, there is also some talk doing the rounds that three years ago your holiday abroad was paid for by some of our dealers.’ He waited for the outburst from RN. There was none. ‘I don’t know what you are talking about, Moorthy. People can say all kinds of things. If you do find any proof of what you are saying, please bring it to me,’ said RN. His voice was now just a notch above a whisper. ‘RN, I just wanted to share with you what I heard. I would like to leave it there,’ said Moorthy, beginning to feel sorry for this bully. He then took his leave. RN’s quick response the next day surprised Moorthy. RN met the CEO and informed him that he was simultaneously instituting a separate review of the warranty policy. The quality audit came out clean. The warranty policy was soon revised and warranty claims came down to less than two per cent of sales. Moorthy stopped shadow-boxing with fears of his impending doom.",

      "content": "14 The Right Choice Gaurav and Payal were a study in contrast. Gaurav believed that the end always justified the means. Winning was paramount; he worked harder than everyone else to achieve that. He was a man in a hurry and had immense self-belief. To him, leadership was all about leading from the front. Failure was never an option. Not for him or for any of his team members. Payal believed that leadership was all about believing in your team, which in turn motivated ordinary people to do extraordinary things. To her, success and failure were two sides of the same coin. One could learn a lot from failure and avoid repeating what caused it in the future. Success too offered many lessons, which could be replicated, going forward. Motivating people was all about holding people accountable without hurting their dignity. A glimpse into Gaurav’s and Payal’s pasts would throw more light on how their beliefs and values were formed. Gaurav’s father was a junior government official in a small town in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. His childhood memories were mostly that of his father being perennially angry. Gaurav studied hard and was an excellent student, without ever receiving a word of praise from his father. Once when he had returned late from a friend’s place, his father called up the friend later to check if Gaurav was telling the truth. His only goal in life was to excel at everything he attempted. Payal’s father was a professor at the Agricultural University, Palampur in Himachal Pradesh. He was soft-spoken and taught her to observe and learn from nature and often reminded her that nature never played favourites. She recalled the occasion when she and her father were being driven to the market; their car had struck the rocky side of the cliff and was badly damaged. Luckily, neither Payal nor her father was injured. It was clearly their driver’s mistake. All her father did was to enquire with the driver if he was okay. They had returned home and the car was sent to the workshop. At night, over dinner, she had asked her father why he had not held the driver accountable, as it was his fault. ‘Do you think the driver wasn’t aware of this, Payal? Did you not notice he was already shaking and expected to be shouted at? It’s only a car and that can be easily repaired. If I had shouted at him and hurt his dignity at that time, I would never have been able to repair that,’ he had replied. And then he said something that would stay with her for a very long time: ‘Remember, Payal, while dealing with people, it always helps to be kind than to be clever.’ Gaurav and Payal had completed their MBA from different management institutes, majoring in finance. Nine years later, they both joined one of India’s largest private sector banks in its head office in Mumbai. Gaurav’s portfolio comprised a large number of corporate accounts while Payal managed small and medium enterprises. Gaurav considered all his colleagues, including Payal, as his main competitors. Success was all about making your colleagues look bad so that you looked good in comparison. Gaurav was rated as ‘Best Performer’ for two years running during which he and his team earned the highest bonuses and for the second consecutive year, his department was rated as the best in employee engagement scores. He was ruthless with himself and believed that this bestowed on him the right to push his team to the extremes. Whenever a team member slipped up, he would berate him or her in public, and then step in to ensure that work never suffered. Some of his best managers had resigned in the last two years. Gaurav branded them as ‘ungrateful and self-serving people’ totally lacking in commitment. Payal had been consistent throughout her career. She and her team usually achieved 90-95 per cent of their targets. But that was not to say that she was soft on her team. She let them know that they, as a team, could have read the market signals better and made appropriate course corrections. She had her share of attrition within her team, but these were mostly at the lower rungs – people with two to three years’ experience. Her managers stayed with her for longer periods. She was of the firm belief that it was the motivated managers who formed the bedrock of any organization as it was they who converted fresh talent into productive resources on a continuing basis. To Gaurav she was a competitor. But Payal saw him as a colleague. Right now, the only subject being discussed in the corridors of the head office was who would be selected to head the new bank that had been recently acquired. Would it be Gaurav or would it be Payal? The consensus was that Gaurav was a clear front-runner. Shweta Desai, the CMD of the bank, announced the decision after due deliberations with the board: Payal would head the new entity. Gaurav was shattered. He had been absolutely sure that, given his performance over the last few years, he would land the job hands down. He had already informed some of his friends and his wife of the impending change in his responsibilities. Whilst his team members were busy congratulating Payal, Gaurav sought an urgent meeting with Shweta. If required, he was willing to go all the way to the other members of the board to challenge the decision. ‘I have performed better than Payal on every parameter. I believe it is a mistake that she has been selected over me,’ said a visibly upset Gaurav. ‘I understand how you feel, Gaurav. The board has made its choice and we must accept it. I can assure you that we examined all aspects before arriving at the decision,’ replied Shweta. ‘I think the bank has been very unfair to me.’ ‘I don’t think you need to feel diminished in any way, Gaurav, just because Payal was selected. You are still one of our valued leaders.’ ‘I would like to know the criteria on which you decided to choose her over me.’ ‘It was never about just choosing one person over the other. We know that over 60 per cent of mergers and acquisitions are known to fail due to cultural incompatibility. We were clear that whoever we picked, would have to be high on people capabilities too. And Payal made the cut.’ ‘How can you say that? I have always scored better than Payal. I was rated Best Performer for two years running. My team and I always exceeded our numbers, which she rarely did.’ ‘At what cost, Gaurav? Some of your best senior-level people have left you. I know that you step in and hold fort for some time, but this attrition only sets us back in our efforts to build a leadership pipeline.’ Gaurav shook his head. ‘Are you telling me that none of her people have left her?’ ‘I never said that. Just look at the people she loses. These are mostly at lower levels. And remember that some of her direct reportees have moved on to key positions in the bank.’ ‘So that makes her people skills better than mine?’ ‘Gaurav, have you seen the way Payal deals with her subordinates when they fail her? She never humiliates or hurts their dignity. On the contrary, don’t you think you are too hard on your subordinates in similar situations?’ said Shweta. Gaurav was buying none of that. ‘I always step in and make sure the work does not suffer.’ ‘That’s a short-term solution, Gaurav. Just see the long-term damage it does,’ said Shweta, not wanting to be too hard on him. ‘So now you will use this short-term versus long-term argument to justify a wrong decision,’ said Gaurav, clearly not willing to listen. ‘All I am saying is that a “moment of truth” about leadership is how we treat subordinates when they fail us. Treat them with dignity and they walk out of our rooms swearing by us. On the contrary, humiliate them and they walk out swearing at us. These things do have a long-term impact on organizations,’ said Shweta, wanting to end the discussion. Gaurav had saved his best for the last. ‘If that is true, what do you say to the fact that my department has scored the highest in employee engagement scores for two consecutive years? I think you are clearly biased. You chose Payal because she is a woman!’ Things had surely got out of hand now. Shweta decided to catch the bull by the horns. ‘I wouldn’t go there, Gaurav. HR has enough data from exit interviews of employees who left you.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I wasn’t keen to bring it up, but you just do not want to listen. We know how you have coerced your team members to give high scores.’ ‘That’s not true,’ said a visibly surprised and slightly defensive Gaurav. ‘It’s difficult to accept the truth, but figures don’t lie, Gaurav. I am afraid we must treat this matter as closed,’ said Shweta.",

      "content": "15 A Helping Hand It was 8 a.m. on a bright Sunday morning in October in Delhi. Nischay had promised to take his wife Nisha and their ten-year-old daughter to Appu Ghar, a popular theme park, and then they would have lunch at an open-air restaurant at Connaught Place. As Nisha was getting ready, Nischay’s mobile phone rang. The caller ID showed it was Harshvardhan. She had to answer it. ‘Hello Mr Harshvardhan, Nischay is in the shower. He will call you back as soon as he is out.’ ‘Good morning, Nisha. That’s fine. Just tell him that I would like to see him at my place by 9.30 a.m. today. Have a nice day!’ Nisha could sense her blood pressure rise. She sat down on the bed as her daughter, all dressed up, came running in and asked, ‘How do I look, mummy?’ Nisha stood up and patted her daughter on her cheek. ‘You look great, baby. Now, go back to your room and I will be with you soon.’ As the child walked back to her room with slow, measured steps, she could hear the door being shut behind her. She knew that her mother was upset about something. ‘All set?’ asked Nischay, as he came out, patting his hair dry. ‘You did not tell me you had a meeting with Harshvardhan at nine-thirty this morning!’ ‘No, I don’t have a meeting with him.’ ‘Don’t lie to me, Nischay. Harshvardhan just called and asked you to be at his place by 9.30 a.m.’ ‘God, not again. He is going to ruin our plans. What did you tell him?’ ‘I told him you would call him once you were out of the shower.’ ‘I promise you, there was no meeting planned. You could have told him about our plans for the day?’ ‘Why should I? He is YOUR client. You tell him. Hope you are not going to ruin our day again?’ said Nisha, clearly upset. ‘That’s not fair. You know he is my biggest client and that, right now, my agency fully depends on him to keep us afloat,’ said Nischay. ‘We were so much better off when you had that regular job two years ago. At least, you had time for us, and we were happy.’ ‘Now please don’t bring that up again, Nisha. I promise I will make up for this soon.’ ‘So, you are not going to call him and tell him about our plans?’ ‘How can I? He may want to approve his next year’s budget today.’ ‘So, what do I tell our daughter? She is so excited.’ ‘I am so sorry, Nisha … I promise I will make up for all this soon.’ ‘The least you can do is inform Harshvardhan about our plans for the day. Maybe he will defer the meeting.’ ‘Shall do that after my meeting with him.’ Nisha knew she was wasting her time expecting her husband to even try and salvage the situation. He seemed to be mortally scared of Harshvardhan. As Nischay pulled out his Honda Amaze from the basement parking, the thought troubling him was that Nisha simply refused to understand how he was struggling to hold on to this major account, coveted by some of the biggest advertising agencies in the country. Harshvardhan produced fuel additives for diesel trucks. A chemical engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur, he had completed his master’s in petroleum engineering from a reputed college in the US, and then worked for over two decades with a large petrochemicals company there. He was credited with developing many useful compounds and additives that were used in the petroleum industry. On his return to India in the early eighties, he had set up a plant that produced additives. A short, stocky person, he was known to be a street fighter when it came to winning in business. Harshvardhan’s company had the biggest market share of the fuel additives market and his products commanded a premium. He was a big spender on advertising and sales promotions and targeted truck drivers through liberal incentive schemes. In fact, he was right up there in the client-agency-supplier food chain. Nischay parked his car on the side of the road, some distance away from his apartment complex, and called Rohin, his creative director. ‘Are you back from Mumbai? Harshvardhan is back and he has just summoned me for a meeting this morning,’ he said. Two months ago, Harshvardhan had seen a Pirelli calendar and insisted that his agency develop a similar one, in a smaller size, to be distributed amongst all truck drivers. Six models were shortlisted, contracts signed, and the photo shoot had been planned for Saturday, which was the day before. ‘Nischay, you should have also come to Mumbai. The shoot went off well but let me tell you, that guy is impossible!’ ‘Harshvardhan sounded upset when I spoke with him this morning. I need to quickly know what exactly happened,’ said Nischay. ‘Well, you know he came to Mumbai a day prior. He was staying at The Oberoi. On Friday evening he hosted a lavish party in his suite for all of us, including the models. As the evening progressed, Harshvardhan’s jokes became more bawdy and he kept hitting on one model in particular. When the party finally came to a close, he asked as to what time the shoot was scheduled the next day. ‘Our photographer told him it was at 11.30 a.m. when it was actually scheduled for 9.30 a.m. By the time Harshvardhan turned up the next day, we had wrapped up the shoot, and the models had left. He was naturally very upset but we all convinced him that he had heard the time incorrectly the previous evening.’ Nischay could sense big trouble ahead. ‘I don’t know whether that was a smart trick to pull on Harshvardhan. I am seeing him in the next hour and I fear he will just sack us.’ ‘That guy is such a pain, Nischay. We had no other choice. Just stay with our story regarding the timing of the shoot and I am sure it will all work out,’ said the creative director. The security person accompanied Nischay to the main entrance of the sprawling bungalow on Prithviraj Marg, from where a uniformed housekeeper ushered him into the large drawing room. Half an hour later, the same housekeeper walked in with a glass of buttermilk and kept it on a side table, saying, ‘Sir will join you soon.’ It was another forty-five minutes later that Harshvardhan walked in wearing a large bathrobe with his name monogrammed on it. ‘Please sit down. Just finished my massage.’ If he knew he was to have his massage, then why did he summon me so early, thought Nischay. He dismissed the thought in a hurry lest his client read his mind. ‘Not an issue, sir. In fact, I got the opportunity to admire the wonderful collection of items around me.’ ‘That’s my wife’s department. I called you to tell you that my trip to Mumbai has been an utter waste of time and money.’ ‘I am sorry that you missed the photo shoot, sir. I apologize for the misunderstanding,’ said Nischay. ‘I don’t think there was any misunderstanding. It’s that damn photographer who intentionally misled me. I don’t want your agency to ever hire his services. Not for my work or for any of your other clients’ work. That chap needs to be blacklisted right away.’ A relieved and much grateful Nischay immediately clutched at this straw. ‘When my creative director briefed me on what transpired in Mumbai, I right away issued instructions that we must blacklist the photographer. In fact, I plan to talk with the professional photographers’ association and inform them about his unprofessional behaviour.’ Harshvardhan smiled for first time that morning, ‘That’s good. Now, shall we look at our advertising plan for the rest of the year?’ Nischay felt relieved. Fifteen days later, when the calendar proofs were shown to Harshvardhan, he rejected each and every page and ordered a new shoot. Nischay had to bear all expenses incurred at Mumbai. The new shoot was planned for a month later at Kolkata. The last flight that evening from Delhi to Kolkata had attained cruising altitude. The ‘fasten seat belt’ sign had been turned off, and, as if on cue, most seat buckles popped open, overhead bin flaps were pulled open, laptops and reading material extricated. Queues started forming in front of the toilets. Nischay, who was seated in the economy class, decided to relax and catch up on some sleep. It would be two hours before they landed. He was tired and a hectic schedule awaited him the next day. Harshvardhan was seated ahead in the business class. Sleep eluded Nischay as his thoughts cut to a more recent scene at the airport, about an hour ago. They were seated in the lounge and Harshvardhan was on his third drink of Scotch. ‘How many models are we seeing tomorrow?’ ‘We have finalized two for this campaign,’ replied Nischay. ‘I thought I made it clear that I wanted to personally see the girls first before we shortlisted them.’ Nischay caught the extra emphasis on the word ‘personally’. ‘Well, sir, I was informed that you had selected them after seeing their portfolios.’ ‘Photographs don’t give the whole picture, do they, Nischay?’ Harshvardhan sounded angry. ‘Nobody informed me about the shortlist.’ ‘Sorry about this, sir.’ The scowl on Harshvardhan’s face was clear evidence that he was not happy. ‘Veg or non-veg, sir?’ the airhostess interrupted Nischay’s thoughts. He opened his eyes and waved her on. About on hour later, as the plane taxied to a halt, Nischay rushed across the aisle and removed Harshvardhan’s briefcase from the overhead bin. Harshvardhan walked ahead as they exited the airport. Nischay followed with their luggage on a trolley. The hotel representative met them inside the airport terminal and accompanied them to the hotel limousine. ‘Have a pleasant stay in Kolkata, sir,’ he said, as he opened the door for Harshvardhan and then softly shut it after him. Harshvardhan had failed to notice that initially the representative had made a move to open the door on Nischay’s side. Nischay thanked his stars that the hotel representative had picked up his cue when he subtly nodded towards Harshvardhan’s side of the car. It was rumoured that such a faux pas by another hotel’s representative had cost one of Harshvardhan’s assistants his job on a previous tour. As they entered the hotel, Harshvardhan turned towards Nischay. ‘I will just go over to the men’s room. Why don’t you check us in? Make sure they give me a king size bed.’ Nischay completed the check-in formalities. Harshvardhan’s room was on the club floor. ‘Shall we go up, Nischay?’ ‘Sure, sir. You are in room 722.’ ‘Thank you, I appreciate that. Come along, let’s check my room first.’ As the two of them waited for an elevator, the bellboy moved into the service lift with their luggage. As the elevator door closed, Harshvardhan made his move. ‘It’s been a long day, Nischay. Can you arrange a bottle of whisky for me? Nothing fancy, a good Indian brand will do. These hotel guys charge an arm and a leg. And by the way, I will appreciate it if you could also arrange a companion for me for the night.’ Nischay froze, as if a bolt of lightning had just struck him. The elevator soon opened on the seventh floor. ‘It’s okay, I can find my room from here. You better hurry and do the needful.’ ‘I’ll try, sir.’ His mind completely blank, Nischay made his way to the lobby. He remained shell-shocked as he sat down on a chair in the lobby. In the past, he had heard rumours of clients making such demands of their agencies and that some agencies did oblige. But not in his wildest dreams did he think it would ever happen to him. Nischay was realistic enough to know that life was not black and white and had to be lived in shades of grey. But this? Never! Time was running out. As he sat there in the lobby, Nischay never felt more alone in his life. He had to do something or else it could easily jeopardize at a moment the agency’s and his future. As he looked around hoping for some divine intervention, he remembered the advice given to him by his mentor who was a doyen in the advertising industry: ‘The best way to handle people like Harshvardhan is to pamper their ego and use humour to deal with them.’ Unfortunately, the joke was on him now. While still in a daze, his gaze fell upon some magazines displayed in the bookstore in front of him. With quick steps, he made his way out of the hotel in the direction of a liquor store which he had noticed as their car turned towards the hotel on their way in. Harshvardhan opened the door and looked beyond Nischay as he walked in meekly. Placing the bottle of whiskey on the table, he turned around and handed over a magazine to Harshvardhan. It was the latest edition of Debonair, modelled after Hugh Hefner’s Playboy. ‘Sir, I have never done this before, so I did not know how to fulfil all your wishes. I have placed fifteen thousand rupees inside the magazine. I guess someone in the hotel can help you find a companion for the night.’ And, as Harshvardhan kept looking at him, he made a quick exit, saying, ‘It’s all in your hands now, sir.’ The die had been cast and Nischay was prepared for any outcome. In the worst case, he would shut down his agency and pick up a regular job. Nisha at least would be happy then. Had he turned around at that instant, he would have seen a smile on Harshvardhan’s face.",

      "content": "16 Killing Two Birds with One Stone Romesh sent out two WhatsApp messages that Friday afternoon. The first one was sent to all his friends and groups: ‘Watch NDTV tonight at 7 p.m. I am participating in a panel discussion on the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry – Future Trajectory. Repeat telecast tomorrow at 2 p.m. Please forward to all friends and associates.’ The second was sent to his boss Arvind, the CEO and owner of south India’s largest pharmaceutical company where Romesh worked as the senior vice president – sales and marketing: ‘Dear Arvind ji, you would recall that last week I had participated in the panel discussion organized by NDTV. Happy to inform you that it will telecast tonight at 7 p.m. The repeat telecast will be tomorrow at 2 p.m. Appreciate if you could find the time to view this. Warm regards, Romesh.’ That evening his mobile phone was inundated with congratulatory messages and calls from many of his colleagues, friends and relatives. The following Monday morning, as he walked into his company’s eight-storey iconic tower on Anna Salai in Chennai, everyone including the security guard, the receptionist, the liftboy, and his secretary congratulated him. He was very happy. The word had spread quickly. As he settled in his plush leather chair, soaking in the glory, there was a knock on the door and MK walked in. ‘Congratulations, sir. My family and I watched your programme on Friday night. It was very good. You spoke the best,’ said MK. ‘Thank you, MK, I appreciate it,’ said Romesh. ‘Arvind sir is calling you. I also told him how good you were on TV,’ said MK Romesh thanked him once again and, picking up his writing pad and pen, he moved out of his office and headed for the top floor that was occupied by just three people: Arvind, his secretary and MK. Arvind was having his tea. There was an extra cup of tea on the table. ‘Morning, Romesh. You are just in time. Have asked for some tea for you too,’ Arvind said. Romesh thanked him and took a seat opposite him and reached out for his cup of tea. ‘Congratulations. You spoke well on that programme.’ ‘Thank you, sir. I am glad you found the time to see it,’ said Romesh. ‘Actually, I could not see it. This morning MK told me that you were the best speaker on the panel. Great show. Helps our company’s brand too.’ Romesh’s colleagues insisted on a party and that evening they met at their favourite watering hole. A few drinks later, they were interacting like college kids. ‘Heard that Arvind congratulated you,’ said Ajit, the HR head. ‘How did you know?’ asked Romesh. ‘MK, who else?’ ‘Yes, Arvind not only congratulated me but also said that I was the best speaker on the panel that night. And you know the greatest irony, guys … he did not even see the telecast,’ said Romesh. ‘Who told you that?’ asked the CFO. ‘Arvind himself. Apparently, MK, who had seen the telecast, updated him.’ ‘I just don’t get it. Why is MK such a big influence on Arvind? He is, after all, just his attendant,’ said an exasperated CFO who, like Romesh, was just under a year old in the company. Ajit, the longest serving employee among those present, spoke, ‘By now, you all know that MK is Arvind’s eyes and ears in our company.’ ‘Why does Arvind depend on him so much?’ asked Romesh addressing Ajit. ‘Muthu Kanthan, or MK as we know him, was their family retainer long before Arvind was born. Later, when Arvind was sent to one of those colleges in the UK, where the only criterion for admission was the family’s wealth, MK accompanied him as his caretaker. This possibly explains the high degree of trust between them. ‘While Arvind was in the final year, his father, the then chairman and founder of our company, died in a car accident, and Arvind had to cut short his education and return to India to take charge of the family business. Being the only son and the largest shareholder, it was only natural that he was made the CEO. MK was soon positioned in the corporate office to serve as his attendant and his eyes and ears!’ said Ajit. ‘This information should have been part of our induction programme,’ said Romesh, amidst loud laughter by the others. Ajit craned his neck forward and lowered his voice. ‘There is one more thing you all need to know. Remember, MK is quite conversant with the English language despite being a ninth-standard dropout. So be careful what you say in front of him. And have you guys noticed? Arvind will never confront any of us and often uses MK to unsettle us. Over the years, I have seen a number of senior level people made to leave in this way.’ The others were quiet as they absorbed these facts. The party broke up at 11 p.m. Romesh continued to represent the company on various industry forums and was often quoted in media reports on the pharmaceutical industry. He regularly appeared on TV and soon became a mini-celebrity within the company. None of this affected Arvind till the time some of his friends and relatives pointed out that Romesh’s frequent appearances in the media often made them wonder who the real CEO of the company was. Not long after that, MK walked into Romesh’s room when he was alone. ‘Yesterday, Arvind sir was talking about you.’ Romesh’s curiosity got the better of him. ‘What was it about?’ he asked. ‘When those distributors called on him after meeting with you, I heard Arvind sir telling them how our sales head spends most of his time in the office here rather than being out in the field across the country,’ said MK and sauntered out of Romesh’s room. If that was meant to be a cue, Romesh took it immediately. He prepared a tour plan to visit major markets over the next twenty days and sent it for Arvind’s approval. The approval came the next day. A subtle re-affirmation that MK’s information was indeed correct. A month later, MK again casually walked into Romesh’s room. ‘Where have you been travelling, sir? Yesterday, I heard Arvind sir tell someone on the phone that our sales head is always out in the field when he should rather be here at the office, monitoring our progress.’ These contradictory statements confused and upset Romesh. Was Arvind trying to send him some message? He recollected what Ajit had said that evening about Arvind using MK to unsettle his senior team members. Should he start looking around for another job? That night, he spoke with his wife about what had transpired over the last one month. ‘I’ve noticed that you’ve been very stressed out over the past few days. I assumed it was work pressure. But I guess it is Arvind’s unpredictable behaviour that is getting to you,’ said his wife. ‘And MK’s arrogance and his undue influence and power,’ said Romesh. ‘Maybe you should start looking around as a precaution,’ advised his wife. ‘Yes, I guess I should do that. But, somehow, I really want to teach both MK and Arvind a lesson.’ ‘You often say that it does not pay to antagonise anybody,’ said his wife. ‘Let’s just quit the system if we are not happy here. But please do look for a job in Chennai itself.’ ‘I am in no hurry, but yes I will start looking around,’ said Romesh. Some search firms responded positively and a couple of interviews were set up. MK continued to behave the way he always did, but it did not bother Romesh now as much as it did before. But, somewhere deep within himself, he still wanted to give it back to MK and Arvind. Within the next three months, Romesh landed a good job in Chennai and put in his papers. While Arvind tried to convince him to stay back, Romesh saw through this as MK had already informed him that the search to find his replacement was already on. Though they parted on amicable terms, Romesh continued to harbour a desire to teach Arvind and MK a lesson. Two months after quitting, Romesh decided to visit his old office for his final settlement. He borrowed a friend’s Mercedes E Class sedan. His own driver was curious to know the reason for borrowing this car, when they already had the Honda City. ‘My new company will soon allot me a similar car and I want you to get used to it. We will also be given a Toyota Camry, which would be used by my wife. So please look for another driver too,’ said Romesh. After finishing his work with the finance department and meeting some of his old colleagues, Romesh sought out MK. ‘I am looking out for a driver. In case you know someone, please let me know.’ ‘Congratulations, sir. I saw your E Class Mercedes. Your driver did inform me that you need a driver for your wife’s Camry,’ said MK ‘Yes, that’s right. Do let me know in case you come across a reliable person.’ ‘Sure, sir, I will look around,’ said MK. Ajit called him a month later. ‘Hi, Romesh looks like you quit a bit early.’ ‘Why do you say that?’ asked Romesh. ‘Yesterday, Arvind announced new perquisites for all function heads. We are now entitled to a Mercedes E Class sedan. And an additional Camry with driver for our spouses.’ ‘Yes, I know,’ blurted out Romesh. ‘How did you know? It was just announced yesterday,’ said a surprised Ajit. Romesh resisted the temptation to tell him about his own contribution in all this. ‘Remember MK had mentioned some time ago that our perquisites would be soon looked into? I never for a moment thought it would be such a bonanza. Congratulations!’ said Romesh. ‘Thanks. And Arvind has upgraded himself to an S class Mercedes.’ That evening, Romesh shared the new developments with his wife and how he had used MK to trick Arvind. ‘I wish I could see the look on Arvind’s face when he finds out the truth,’ said his wife. ‘Just you wait and see,’ said Romesh. ‘The game has only begun.’ A month later Romesh sought a meeting with Arvind under the pretext of providing him with some leads for pharmaceutical exports to Africa. MK was confused to see Romesh arrive in his old Honda City. ‘What will you have, Romesh?’ asked Arvind. ‘Just some green tea,’ said Romesh. ‘And congratulations, sir. I understand that all function heads have been allotted an E Class Mercedes each and their wives get chauffeur-driven Camrys. I wonder if I left too soon.’ ‘You can’t have any complaints, Romesh. MK informs me you have the same in your new company,’ said Arvind. ‘No, not really,’ said Romesh. ‘I still have only one car. The same old Honda city with the same old driver.’ The next day, Romesh received the call he was expecting. It was Ajit. ‘Hey, Romesh! Heard you met Arvind yesterday?’ ‘Yes, I had come to meet him.’ ‘When it rains, it pours. MK has been transferred to our plant in Tirunelveli with immediate effect.’ ‘I am happy for all of you,’ said Romesh. ‘You should have stayed, Romesh. Imagine, you would have enjoyed all this here. And no MK, either.’ ‘Not really,’ said Romesh, as he suppressed a smile.",

      "content": "17 The Power of Proximity Gopal’s feet dragged as he made his way out of his client’s office. Could he have done something different to salvage this account? Six years ago, this very client had supported Gopal in setting up his advertising agency. Ten minutes ago, the same client, who accounted for 70 per cent of his current business, had sacked his agency. Gopal had pleaded, ‘I am sorry if you feel let down, sir. I promise from now on I will personally oversee this account.’ ‘I really have nothing against you or your agency, Gopal. It’s just that my new marketing head feels that we need a fresh approach. And I need to give him a free hand if I am to hold him accountable,’ said his erstwhile mentor and CEO of the company. As Gopal made his way to the parking lot to pick up his car, his body language clearly showed that he was completely devastated. His inner voice, which helped him bounce back every time he faced such setbacks, seemed to have completely deserted him. The receptionist in his office noticed his condition as he made his way to his room. ‘Hope you are okay, Gopal?’ ‘I am fine. Could you please request Iyer to come over if he is free?’ said Gopal. ‘Sure,’ she said. Iyer, the creative director, and Gopal had worked together in one of India’s biggest advertising agencies prior to their starting this agency six years earlier. Unlike Gopal, who had only worked in the advertising industry all along, Iyer had worked with some large manufacturing companies earlier. ‘What happened Gopal? You look as if a car just hit you,’ said Iyer as he walked into Gopal’s room. ‘More like a truck,’ said Gopal with a feeble smile. ‘Looks like the meeting did not go off well?’ ‘It was a complete disaster! Our biggest client just sacked us. We are in big trouble,’ said Gopal. ‘It’s not the end of the world, Gopal. Clients have left us in the past and we have managed to survive,’ said Iyer. ‘Yes, I know, but none as large as this one. These guys accounted for over seventy percent of our revenues. I am worried for our agency and for our employees, especially those who left more secure jobs to join us and chose to believe in us.’ ‘Don’t worry, Gopal, this too shall pass and we will pull through,’ said Iyer. Both Gopal and him knew that this time things would not be the same. ‘I don’t know how to break this news to the rest of the team,’ said Gopal. There was a knock on his door. It was the receptionist. ‘Before I leave for the day, I thought I would remind you that the inauguration of Mr Talwar’s third factory is at 11 a.m. tomorrow.’ Gopal thanked her as she said good night and shut the door. ‘Let us wait for a day or two before we talk to the rest of the team,’ said Iyer. ‘I think we should do it tomorrow itself. In our industry, word spreads fast and I am sure someone will know of this soon. And I don’t want to go for the inauguration tomorrow. Let’s break the news here tomorrow,’ said Gopal. ‘I think we must go for the inauguration tomorrow. Talwar has a huge advertising account and who knows something miraculous could happen there,’ said Iyer. ‘I am not comfortable going there. Someone in their marketing team may be aware of our losing this client today. I am not ready for any fake sympathies,’ said Gopal. ‘I will go with you so you don’t have to interact with any of those guys. My sixth sense tells me that we have to be there.’ ‘If you say so,’ said Gopal. They did not go to their agency the next morning, choosing to reach the venue directly from their homes and arrived forty-five minutes ahead of schedule. A steady stream of people kept arriving. They sat down under the gazebo tent set up in the parking area of the new factory. Giant-sized promotional balloons with the company’s logo emblazoned on them were hoisted alongside its billboards. Over two thousand guests were expected to attend the event: employees, dealers, vendors, bankers and government officials. Some came to admire the extravagant proceedings, but clearly, the majority had come to mark their presence with the one man who seemed to hold their collective destiny in his hands: the grand old man who was the owner and chairman of the company, Mr Talwar. What had started off as a small trading firm four decades ago was today India’s largest consumer durables brand with a 52 per cent market share. Fully aware that every eye in the audience was fixed on him, Talwar stood tall on the podium surveying the crowd. While most of the faces had a look of joyous anticipation, there was one face in the middle row that wore a worried and forlorn look. That face belonged to Gopal. As he and Iyer sat there contemplating their problems, their thoughts were interrupted by some commotion in the front. Talwar, sensing there was still time for the function to start, stepped down from the stage to greet some of his important guests in the front rows. Iyer nudged Gopal: ‘Why don’t you go over and engage him in some conversation? Doesn’t matter what you say but make sure he is seen talking with you for at least a few minutes.’ ‘Where are you going with this Iyer?’ ‘Just look around you. Every eye in this place is on Talwar. See the marketing head standing in the corner there. From the time we arrived, I have only seen him trying to catch Talwar’s eye.’ ‘So?’ ‘Please do as I say. Keep him engaged. Remember it must be for a few minutes. And leave the rest to me. I think our miracle is about to happen,’ said Iyer. With no idea about what was happening, Gopal got up and moved purposefully towards the front rows. He had learned to trust Iyer’s advice. The immaculately dressed Talwar cut a tall and imposing figure. Gopal, admittedly, was rather short, and certainly lacking in style. When Talwar turned to him and extended his hand in his direction, Gopal hung on to it as if his life depended on it. Talwar, who was taken aback by the tight grip of Gopal’s handshake, seemed inwardly delighted at this public display of deference and enthusiasm from one of his agency heads. ‘Many congratulations to you sir. My agency and I are proud to be serving you,’ said Gopal. Talwar smiled graciously. ‘It would have been all the more wonderful, sir, if your late father could have been here on this historic day,’ said Gopal, not loosening his tight grip. Talwar moved his head closer to Gopal’s ear, as the chatter from the crowd made it difficult to hear and be heard. ‘Thank you for your kind words. Indeed, had my father been alive today, I am sure he would have been proud of the great heights I have achieved.’ For the next four minutes, Talwar continued speaking expansively about his achievements. And throughout those minutes, Gopal kept nodding his head as if in perfect agreement, while not letting go of Talwar’s hand. To many observers around, especially Vikrant, vice-president of marketing, who was watching from his corner, it seemed as if his boss and the agency head were engaged in a serious conversation. Not for a single moment did Vikrant’s eyes waver from the two of them. And not for a moment did Gopal slacken his grip on the chairman’s hand. The master of ceremonies soon picked up the microphone. Talwar pulled his hand away, gave Gopal a light pat on his shoulder and moved towards the stage. The event was about to begin. Gopal returned to his seat and shared with Iyer as to what had transpired between Talwar and him. Iyer, who had timed everything, gave him the thumbs up. As the event came to a close and people started moving towards the food tents, they noticed Vikrant quickly making his way towards them. Iyer whispered a few quick words to Gopal. ‘Looks like the chairman had a long and serious conversation with you? I hope all is well?’ said Vikrant. ‘Oh yes!’ replied Iyer, ‘Mr Talwar is obviously concerned about the need to increase sales, now that the third factory is about to start up. He spoke with Gopal on some of his thoughts and strategies on how to achieve that. He seemed to like what Gopal told him and has asked us to be ready with a new national campaign.’ And before Vikrant could notice Gopal’s surprised look, Iyer continued, ‘He has asked us to see him after getting your inputs on this. Can we see you tomorrow around 11 a.m. in your office?’ ‘Sure, come over,’ said Vikrant and moved away. The two of them decided not to stay for lunch. Gopal was clearly agitated. ‘What the hell are you up to, Iyer? We have just lost our biggest client and now with this you will make sure that Vikrant will also sack us once he learns the truth.’ ‘Just chill Gopal, and trust me,’ said Iyer. ‘I have worked in large family-run companies where all the power is concentrated in the hands of the founder. There is no way Vikrant will check with Talwar. For him, as with the rest of the employees, perception is reality. Remember, you spent a full four minutes with Talwar and he patted you on the shoulder as he parted from you. That’s all we need.’ The next day, Gopal and Iyer were in Vikrant’s office to discuss new approaches for the prospective campaign. On their way out, they checked with Talwar’s secretary whether he was free. She checked with Talwar and ushered them into Talwar’s office. The miracle was unfolding. ‘I have never seen such a large gathering as I saw at the inauguration yesterday, sir. It was a great function,’ said Iyer. He then went on to brief Talwar about their discussions with Vikrant and shared some thoughts on the new campaign that they were planning to push the increased production in the market. Talwar gave them a few pointers too. Iyer thanked Talwar for his thoughts and suggested that it would help if he could also share these thoughts with his VP Marketing so that everyone was on the same page. Talwar asked his secretary to get the Vikrant on the intercom. ‘Gopal and Iyer are here with me and we have been discussing the new campaign. I have asked them to look at a completely new positioning for our brand and now with this new plant going into production we will be the clear number one in India. I would like for them to present the new campaign in four weeks before I leave for my European holiday this summer.’ Four weeks later, Gopal made the presentation. He had fully incorporated the Chairman’s suggestions in the campaign. ‘I like it,’ said a gleeful Talwar and turned towards Vikrant. ‘What do you think?’ ‘I think the new positioning strategy is perfect. Gopal and his team have nailed it,’ he replied. ‘Who do you think gave them the idea?’ asked a beaming Talwar. Iyer addressed Vikrant, ‘That day, when we met the chairman after meeting you … most of these are his ideas…’ He then turned towards the chairman, ‘And the last three slides, which you felt were brilliant, were suggested by Vikrant, sir.’ ‘Great! So how soon can we launch this campaign?’ asked Talwar. The marketing head looked at Gopal who replied, ‘As it is an integrated multimedia campaign, sir, we should do it in three weeks.’ That year, out of the three agencies that worked for this client, the major share of advertising budget went to Gopal’s agency. His pipeline of business was full for the next two years and his agency more than made up for the loss in revenues from the other client.",

      "content": "18 The Amroha Effect It was nearing 9 p.m. and they were running late. The tension in the car was suffocating. It would be easily another thirty minutes before they reached Amroha in UP. This was to be the last stop on their itinerary before Vignesh and his managing director, Sujit, made the return journey to Delhi. ‘This could have been planned better. How late are we?’ Sujit’s anger was palpable. ‘Two hours, sir,’ replied Vignesh, the vice president of sales. ‘By now, we should have been halfway back to Delhi. I don’t like travelling on these roads after dark.’ ‘I had clearly instructed our dealers to avoid felicitations of any kind as you were keen to only discuss sales targets and move on quickly. But I am sure it’s a rare honour for them when you visit their dealership.’ Sujit seemed to mellow a bit. ‘That’s all right, but there was no need to invite virtually the whole town. How many were there in the last dealership we just visited? A hundred and fifty?’ Though it was dark inside the car, Vignesh could sense that his boss seemed rather pleased. ‘No sir, my estimate is it was well over two hundred.’ ‘These guys spend so much money on felicitating me,’ Sujit said, shaking his head. ‘Why can’t they spend all this money on increasing their marketing efforts to sell more of our tractors?’ Vignesh was clearly relaxed by now. He reached for his cellphone. ‘I will just call the Amroha dealer and tell him to cut out the ceremonies.’ Sujit said, rather quickly, ‘No, no. This time, let it be. Let’s not disappoint him. But the next time, yes, you must tell them that all this is unnecessary.’ ‘Sure, sir. By the way, do you know how this place Amroha got its name?’ said Vignesh, attempting to cheer up the mood in the car. ‘No, I don’t know,’ said Sujit. ‘Legend has it that the first part of the name comes from aam, the mangoes that this place is known for. The second part of its name comes from rohu, a variety of fish that is found in abundance here.’ ‘Interesting, I did not know that,’ said Sujit thoughtfully. ‘And, by the way, what are the Amroha dealer’s targets for the next three months?’ The time for small talk was clearly over. ‘An average of fifteen tractors per month.’ ‘Just that…’ Sujit didn’t complete the sentence as their car had pulled into the well-lit archway. They had reached Amroha. The dealer’s office building was fully decorated. Sujit was slightly overwhelmed by the scale of the arrangements at each of the dealerships he had visited on his trip. He was, however, rather pleased by the level of awe with which he was regarded. Once the usual garlanding and felicitations were over, Sujit, Vignesh and the dealer were soon seated in the dealer’s office. Sujit was a person who preferred to get straight to the point. ‘And what’s your sales target for the next three months?’ The question was addressed to the dealer who kept glancing at Vignesh, desperately seeking some hints. ‘And remember, with our new factory starting production next month, your sales targets will only increase,’ Sujit continued. ‘I will easily sell around fifty tractors per month, sir,’ the dealer replied. The scene in the room was a study in contrasts. While the dealer exuded optimism, Vignesh looked as if he had just been hit by a hurricane. The piece of paper in Sujit’s hand clearly read fifteen tractors per month and he was not sure if he had heard the man right. ‘Did you say one five or five zero?’ he enquired, speaking as slowly as he could and enunciating every syllable carefully. ‘Not one five, sir. I said five zero per month,’ the dealer said earnestly. ‘Five zero?’ Sujit persisted. ‘Yes, sir,’ said the dealer with a smile. ‘So, you are clearly telling me that you will sell one hundred and fifty tractors over the next three months?’ The question was clearly directed at the dealer, but it was Vignesh who felt the heat of his boss’s glare. Sujit had suspected all along that his salespeople did not have their ears to the ground. What greater evidence than this? ‘No problem, sir. In fact, if you want, I can do ten to fifteen more,’ said the dealer. ‘Shall I put down your target as a hundred and sixty for the next quarter?’ ‘Of course, sir,’ came the unhesitating reply. Sujit felt triumphant. ‘Thank you very much, and I appreciate all your nice arrangements.’ Vignesh had just enough time to run towards the car and open the door as his boss hurried in. The drive back began in silence. The road was narrow, and the traffic was mostly large, overloaded trucks. Their car had come close to colliding with these overladen monsters twice. The driver was alert and focused. Sujit was equally alert, more focused, and very angry. The silence was unbearable and Vignesh wished that Sujit would say something, even shout at him. This was just the calm before the storm. And when the deluge happened, it did not come as anticipated. It came in very measured sentences. ‘This is the last time I want to be travelling on these terrible roads after dark. In any case, you and your team seem to have no clue at all about what is happening on the ground. Here is the Amroha dealer, charged up and ready to sell a hundred and sixty tractors in the next three months. And what is the target you have set for him? Forty-five? Is this some kind of joke?’ Vignesh began haltingly, ‘No, sir … but sir…’ but Sujit cut him off. ‘You heard the dealer yourself. On the one hand our company makes these major investments to double our production capacity. And on the other, just look at the kind of targets you guys set for our dealers. This is completely irresponsible behaviour. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. And I don’t want to hear anything more from you,’ Sujit finished, effectively shutting him up. During the rest of the journey, no one spoke. Vignesh used the silence to mentally update his CV and tried to recall the names of the two headhunters who had contacted him last year. Should he look outside the industry? The tractor industry was a small one. Word would soon spread that he had been fired. But then how would people know? Maybe the car driver understood English? It was nearing midnight by the time they reached Sujit’s residence in Friends Colony. ‘I want to see you in my office tomorrow at 11 a.m. Good night.’ The next day, early morning, Sujit settled down in his favourite garden chair with his cup of tea and a newspaper. As he sat there, he observed the company car arrive outside his gate. To his surprise, Vignesh and the Amroha dealer stepped out of the car. They walked up the driveway and came to stand before him in his garden. ‘What happened? I hope all is well?’ ‘Yes sir, all is well,’ said Vignesh, looking distinctly less anxious than he had last night. The Amroha dealer, standing close behind, was holding his ears, as if to apologize for something. Vignesh said, ‘After dropping you here last night, I drove back all the way to Amroha, woke him up, and asked him what his real target was. Would you care to listen to him now, sir?’ Sujit looked at the dealer, perplexed and beginning to get annoyed. ‘What is happening here? I thought we had agreed that you would sell one hundred and sixty tractors over the next three months?’ The dealer sounded deeply apologetic. ‘I am very sorry, sir, but with great difficulty I will be able to sell between thirty-five and forty tractors next quarter.’ ‘Then why the hell did you commit to a target of one hundred and sixty?’ Sujit exploded. The dealer flinched, voice falling to a whimper, ‘I am very sorry, sir.’ ‘Stop pulling at your ears and tell me the truth.’ The dealer’s words poured out in a rush, ‘I thought, sir, that when such a big man like you comes all the way to my dealership and asks me for sales projection, then I have to give a big number.’ Sujit looked at Vignesh who had a triumphant look on his face. Sujit could not help but see the humour in the whole episode. And, in a way, he had contributed to this situation. The dealer sold forty-two tractors in that quarter. And Vignesh did not contact the two executive search firms. Sujit did have a moment’s suspicion whether Vignesh had staged the whole thing to send him a message. But that passed quickly. On a positive note, though, Sujit, who had a reputation for being carried away often by what people told him, learnt a big lesson that day. He realized that people tend to tell you what they think you want to hear. This phenomenon came to be known as the ‘Amroha Effect’ within the company. And never again did Sujit fall prey to the Amroha Effect!",

      "content": "19 Did You Bite Off More Than You Can Chew? ‘Hi, Naina can I drop in and see you now?’ It was Adil on the phone. It was 7.30 p.m. and I was preparing to go home. Most of the staff had left. ‘Where are you now?’ I asked. ‘At Hauz Khas. I can be there in thirty minutes,’ he pleaded. I knew he would take a minimum of forty-five minutes to get to our office in Greater Kailash II in South Delhi. Traffic at that time was still bad. He sounded anxious, so I said, ‘Okay, come over Adil. I’ll wait for you.’ I called home and informed my husband that I would be late. As I waited for Adil, my mind went back five years to the time when he had joined our advertising agency in the print production department. He came from a much larger agency where he was the second in command in that function. Keen to leverage his contacts with suppliers and major printing houses in Delhi, I offered to take him on as the head of the department. We were a midsized setup and I had expected Adil to negotiate a good deal for himself in this move. ‘I hope you are satisfied with our offer?’ I asked him. ‘Thank you for the salary hike, I am happy with that. But can we re-look at the designation?’ he said. ‘I think Head, Print Production is appropriate. That truly reflects your role here and your predecessor too had this designation.’ ‘Could you please designate me as account director.’ I was quite taken aback. I said, ‘Your role here has nothing to do with the servicing function. That would be misleading in my opinion.’ ‘You know, moving from a large agency has already affected my image in the eyes of my colleagues there. Being designated as account director will help me save face with them,’ he said. I had felt then that I was making a big mistake offering to make him even the head of the print production function. How could someone, who drew his self-worth from what others thought of him, ever provide leadership to any team? However, not wanting to demotivate him at the very start of his career with us, I let him call himself account director. During his four years with us, he was an average performer who worked hard and never shied away from getting his hands dirty. I still remember how excited he sounded when he walked into my room that day eleven months ago. ‘Naina, I have got a great job offer from this large, diversified group. They have nine companies in India and Dubai and have offered me the position of vice-president, corporate communications. The salary and perquisites package are also much better.’ To me something about this did not sound right. He had neither the relevant experience nor the expertise for this new role. And the salary and perks offered were way above his real market value. ‘So, what have you decided, Adil?’ I asked him. ‘I really want to look at this offer, Naina. What do you think?’ he asked. ‘I have heard things about that group and am not sure whether I would recommend this job to you, Adil. Don’t get me wrong. There are stories floating around. They have suddenly become very visible in the last three or four years.’ ‘But they have 8,000 employees and seem to be doing well. The best part is they are located right here in Delhi. My daughter remains in the same school and I only have to shift to a larger flat.’ I had seen the corporate sector from up close. While I did not want to dampen his enthusiasm, I felt that I had to caution him on what he could be up against. ‘Adil, are you sure you are up for this? A large part of your new role would be about managing the dynamics amongst the various CEOs in the group, something you have never done in the past.’ ‘Don’t you think they would have assessed my capabilities before offering me the job, Naina? And the best part is that I report directly to the chairman.’ ‘The fact that you report to the chairman could create envy amongst the other senior folk. Remember, the biggest mistake many people make is to take on a job much beyond their existing competencies. They then struggle to cope in the new role and are in constant dread of being found out,’ I said, attempting to caution him. He seemed to have made up his mind and to some extent I felt guilty; by offering him a designation that did not really reflect his role, I had contributed to his being blindsided about his true abilities. At the same time, I realized that anything I said would only be construed as a ploy to hold him back, so I wished him the very best and let him leave. Money and designations meant a lot to him. After all, was that not the very reason he had come to us? I met Adil thrice since the time he left us. Every time he passed by our office, he would call and drop in on the pretext of having coffee with me. On each occasion he made it a point to tell me how close he was to the chairman, and how he often accompanied him abroad on the company jet. Adil also said his daughter was now being dropped and picked up from school in his chauffeur-driven Honda City. The list went on. The security guard called and informed that Adil was on his way to my office. It was 8.20 p.m. His face was ashen and he seemed to have aged. As he sat down, I offered him a glass of water, which he immediately placed on the table. His hands were trembling. I waited till his breathing returned to normal. ‘What happened, Adil? You seem very scared! Please relax.’ Tears welled up in his eyes. ‘Naina, I just don’t know what to do. This evening my chairman sought my resignation. He said I was not pulling my weight and that the other business unit heads were not happy with my contributions.’ My first instinct was to tell him that I had warned him but that would have been insensitive. ‘Things don’t happen so suddenly, Adil. They need to give you proper feedback and sufficient opportunity to improve. They are giving you full notice, I hope.’ ‘There is a top management strategy off-site meet planned next week and I have been excluded from that. The chairman felt it best that I resign and be away during the notice period.’ ‘Please have some water. Shall I ask for a coffee or tea for you?’ ‘No, thank you, Naina. I am okay. I should have listened to you before I took that job.’ ‘We all make mistakes, Adil. I am glad that this is over. Now go home and relax. I am sure you will find another good job soon.’ ‘The reason I came to see you, Naina, is that I have not informed my wife yet. I am worried she may go into depression. I hope you can give me a job.’ Our head of print production had resigned, and I was indeed looking for a replacement. I wanted to help Adil, but had to tread carefully. ‘Your earlier position here just fell vacant. But I am not sure how long you will stay with us this time.’ ‘Trust me Naina, this time it will be different.’ Not wanting to raise his expectations I said, ‘I hope you realize that even if I offer you a job, it will have to be at the same level and salary as it was when you had left us.’ I could see him struggle for the right words. ‘Could my salary be raised to cover the instalment payments of a new flat that I have booked recently?’ he asked. ‘My family, especially my daughter, is used to getting dropped to her school in my car. Could you also extend me the facility of a car and driver?’ ‘Sorry, Adil, the package will have to be exactly as before. I cannot afford to give wrong signals to our existing employees.’ He looked beaten. ‘I understand. Can I make a request please?’ ‘Sure, go ahead.’ ‘Do appreciate where I am coming from. Would it be okay if I try and look around for a job that hopefully pays something close to my current salary and perquisites? Just give me a month for this. Otherwise, I shall take your offer and promise not to leave.’ I thought that was a fair request. ‘I am fine with that. I shall wait for a month.’ He suddenly appeared much more relaxed. He thanked me and we walked out together. I felt sad for Adil and many others like him. If only he had listened to me eleven months ago. I had cautioned him about taking a job that paid much above his market value, and one that demanded capabilities way beyond what he possessed. A month later, Adil re-joined us. His designation, salary and perquisites were exactly the same as they were when he left us. I was happy that I could help him. Adil’s real problem was not the way the chairman treated him. It was his unrealistic perceptions about his own capabilities. Like so many other corporate professionals, Adil had bitten off more than he could chew!",

      "content": "20 What’s Sweeter Than Revenge? It was 3.30 a.m. Sleep had abandoned him. Ashok got up from his side of the bed, careful not to wake up his wife Prabha, and moved to the balcony of their seventeenth-floor apartment. He sat on the swing there, looking down at the DLF Golf Course Road, which was deserted and quiet at that time. He knew it was just another few hours before this road erupted in noise and chaos, punctuated by instances of road rage. He looked up at the sky. Everything looked calm and peaceful. Only he was aware of the turmoil within himself. The Fenesta doors slid open behind him and Prabha quietly came over and sat beside him. She rested her head on his shoulder. Neither of them said anything for a long time. The events of that evening flashed through his mind. Eight hours ago, Ashok had walked into his flat, trying to appear normal. ‘You don’t look very good. Is everything okay?’ his wife enquired. It was her birthday and she was all dressed up. He had promised to take her to the club. The children were at a sleepover at a friend’s place. ‘Yes, all is well. Why do you ask?’ He tried to smile. But wives have this sixth sense. She stood in front of him, looked him in the eye and said, ‘Remember, Ashok? We promised to be honest with each other.’ He sighed. ‘Give me a glass of water,’ he said, and sat down on the settee in the drawing room. She joined him a minute later, carrying a glass of water, waiting for him to begin. ‘I got fired today,’ he whispered. The news hit Prabha hard and she felt her legs were about to collapse under her. She managed to get a hold on herself and sat down. She knew she had to be strong for Ashok’s sake. ‘How could they do that? You are the country head in India,’ she managed to say. ‘What really hurts is the way it was done.’ With a pained look in his eyes, he continued, ‘You remember Jeffrey, who was promoted as president of our company last month?’ ‘Yes, I remember him. Was he not transferred from the UK to the US?’ ‘Yes, that’s him. He is currently on a visit to India. This evening, he called me into his room and didn’t even have the courtesy to ask me to sit down. All he uttered were a few sentences. He started by saying: ‘Ashok, you know that I am now the president and CEO of the company.’ ‘Of course, Jeffrey,’ I replied. ‘You and I have had many disagreements in the past. I still remember those executive committee meetings where you often made me look bad,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Come now, Jeffrey. Don’t take it so personally. It’s just that we often differed on the strategic directions of our company. I don’t even remember those incidents now.’ ‘You may have forgotten, but I have not,’ he said. And before I could say anything, he continued, ‘my immediate priority is to build a team that I can trust.’ ‘I understand, Jeffrey. Please rest assured you have my full support.’ ‘The truth is that I don’t trust you, Ashok. I am sorry I can’t have you on my team,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Are you firing me?’ I asked him. ‘Well, things would be less messy if you just resigned. I am sure you would prefer it that way.’ ‘You don’t leave me much of a choice, do you, Jeffrey? This is all too sudden,’ I said. ‘Well I cannot help it. I need to build my team at the earliest,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Okay I shall resign and serve my notice. When do you want to make the announcement?’ I asked him. ‘I want you to resign and quit immediately. Your accounts will be settled right away and we shall ensure you get a good severance package.’ Ashok finished recounting the conversation. ‘And that was it, Prabha. Just those few sentences and he sacked me, just like that. I have never felt so humiliated in all my life,’ said Ashok. Jeffrey and Ashok had been colleagues till just a few months ago. In fact, in the internal pecking order of the executive leadership team, Ashok was rated higher than Jeffrey. Every one within that team was completely taken aback when Jeffrey was promoted to replace the previous president. Prabha was lost for words. She could see that Ashok was devastated. What could or should she say at a time like this? ‘Don’t worry, Ashok. We have been through so many difficult situations in the past and have we not overcome all of them?’ ‘I know. But remember, I am not getting any younger. It’s not going to be easy to find a job soon. And our kids would be ready for college in the next two years. Why does all this have to happen now?’ ‘God has taken care of us till now and He will not forsake us now. We must not lose faith,’ said Prabha. ‘If there is a God up there, I pray that one day Jeffrey goes through what he has done to me. I can never forgive him.’ They did not go out for dinner that night. Prabha changed her clothes and made some omelettes and toast. Neither had an appetite and neither spoke much over dinner. It was as if death had suddenly descended on their home and taken away someone precious. They later retired to bed. In the days following his sacking, Ashok went into a shell and refused to meet anyone. Though money was not an immediate problem, Prabha worried that Ashok’s self-esteem was so low that he would soon go into depression. The kids were very understanding and supportive. Close friends who were aware of the situation tried to do their best to counsel Ashok without appearing to be sympathetic or condescending. And then, what Prabha feared the most came to pass – Ashok had a heart attack. Fortunately, it happened during the day while they had some friends over for lunch. Ashok suddenly broke into a cold sweat and complained of a shooting pain in his left arm and feeling some discomfort around his neck and jaw. He was rushed to a hospital close by and immediately taken into the emergency section. Three arteries were blocked and the doctors took him into the operation theatre at once. Four hours later, he was moved into a private ward with restricted access to family members. Prabha stayed in his room throughout and the children visited twice a day. Ashok could see what all this had done to his family, and, deep within his repaired heart, he only wished for one thing – that Jeffrey too suffered the way he was suffering. Ashok took a few weeks to recover from his operation. Friends visited him at home. Many brought flowers and a few even gifted some books. And the best thing that happened during this period was that he caught up with his reading. His favourite book, the one on Nelson Mandela, a truly inspiring story, was kept on his bedside table. He soon put himself in the market and connected with executive search firms. A few offers came by and he accepted the role of COO with a technology company in Chennai. A very difficult phase in his life was behind him. Three years later, a large US-based private equity firm hired Ashok to oversee some of their investments in the technology space. One of these was the company he had worked for earlier and where Jeffrey was still the president. Soon it was time for Ashok to travel to the US and meet up with Jeffrey and his team. They met in Jeffrey’s office in Palo Alto. ‘Jeffrey, you know that your company is now a part of my portfolio,’ Ashok began. Jeffrey nodded, and recalling their interaction four years ago in India, he knew what was coming. Ashok continued, ‘The last time we met, you would recall, it was not a very nice experience, especially for me.’ ‘Ashok, you know that was not personal. I was just doing my job,’ Jeffrey said defensively. ‘Yes, of course Jeffrey. Just the way I was doing my job when I differed with you on strategy while we were together. None of it was personal.’ ‘I see where you are going. So this is all about revenge,’ said Jeffrey waiting for the inevitable. ‘Well, I would not put it that way. It’s just that I too have a job to do. And my first priority, of course, is to decide on a team here that I can trust.’ He is playing with me first before the final thrust, thought Jeffrey. Ashok paused for a moment and what he said next completely stunned Jeffrey, ‘I want to tell you that I have full trust in you, Jeffrey, and I look forward to your support. Come, let’s go and meet your team.’ As they moved towards the conference room, where the others waited, Jeffrey did not believe a word of what Ashok said. All this was a ploy to make him drop his guard before the final shot was delivered. Ashok greeted the others. Some of them were his ex-colleagues and some had worked with him. After the initial exchange of pleasantries, he addressed them, ‘You know this is one of the best companies in my portfolio. From whatever I have seen, Jeffrey and you all are doing a great job. I would like all of you to continue just the way you have been doing. I will visit every quarter and promise to spend more time with you during the next trip. On this visit, I wanted to just say hello to you all and catch up with Jeffrey.’ Some of them were aware of the manner in which Ashok had been forced to leave the company and believed that Jeffrey’s days were numbered. Jeffrey felt like a condemned man whose sentence had been pronounced and all that remained was the electric chair. How he wished Ashok had just fired him and ended the suspense! In any case, he had made up his mind to connect with an executive search firm soon. A few days later, Jeffrey received an email from Ashok reiterating his trust in him and his team. What caught his eye was the quote at the end of the mail: ‘As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.’ – Nelson Mandela. At that moment, Jeffrey realized how wrong he was and his respect for Ashok grew manifold. Sometimes, revenge isn’t as sweet, perhaps, as forgiveness.",

      "content": "21 The Last Supper There was not a single occasion when Samarth did not challenge or counter anything I said. It was not just me, but every member in our leadership team had often been at the receiving end of his caustic tongue. He reserved his best for those meetings in which the MD was also present. Samarth’s behaviour was starting to get to me, but it’s not as if I had not been forewarned! A year ago, prior to my joining the company as the head of marketing, the head of the search firm had informed me, ‘Given your current track record, Rudra, I think you will easily make the transition to this automobile company.’ He continued, ‘This company is on a great trajectory and has an employee-centric culture. You will find that the top team works as a great unit and they are all very supportive of each other. The only person you need to watch out for is the head of sales, Samarth. Try not to rub him the wrong way. He believes that the sales function is the key business driver in the company and every other function is subordinate to sales. And, as for his views on marketing, the less said the better.’ I laughed and interrupted him, ‘I thought you would motivate me to take this job. Instead, you seem to be scaring me away from it.’ He smiled and said, ‘Of course not, Rudra. But it’s my duty to give you a realistic picture. As a principle, I never oversell a job to a client. And that’s why I have possibly the best track record in this industry. I believe that a job is no different than life itself. Start either of them with the wrong expectations and then there is no end to frustration. I want to, however, assure you that you will find a great ally in Pratik, the MD.’ I could see he was trying his best not to alarm me. After weighing the pros of staying on at India’s best-known FMCG company, and the cons of moving to the automobile sector, I decided to take the plunge. Their Japanese partners were global leaders and it could be my stepping-stone to an international career. Samarth was the consummate sales person, articulate and aggressive. Five feet seven in height, built like a prize-fighter with his shoulders always hunched, ready to deliver that knockout punch. I could visualize him maintaining that posture even while he slept! Winning was everything to him. Be it a discussion where he always had the last word, or a sales deal, which he had to win at any cost, even if it meant going against set industry practices. He couldn’t care less that competition often raised a hue and cry singling out our practices for being questionable. Over a cup of coffee, I once asked the HR head, ‘Don’t you think Samarth is more equal than the rest of us? Why does Pratik always give him such a long rope?’ ‘I get a feeling that since Samarth always meets his numbers, it helps Pratik face the analysts with confidence. I did point out to Pratik that Samarth’s abrasive attitude was undermining team spirit. Pratik defended him saying, “Oh, that is just how he is. He actually means no harm,’” replied the HR head. Once every quarter, Pratik and Samarth would travel to Tokyo to attend the periodical review meetings with our collaborators. And on their return, it was customary for Pratik to brief us on what transpired in those meetings and we all looked forward to this. What followed after this was unbearable. Samarth, would literally take it upon himself to educate us on the latest developments in Japan and around the globe. It would not be so excruciating had he limited himself to developments in the sales function. But that was never to be. He was an authority on every subject under the sun. During one such meeting, I interrupted his monologue, and countered him. Samarth was ready with his riposte, ‘Sorry, Rudra, I am not on the same page with you right now. I suggest you lend me the book from which you are quoting this. Let me read that too and then we can discuss.’ I had walked into that one. I looked around the room for support. Pratik and the others were smiling and seemed to enjoy my discomfiture. Soon Pratik signalled, ‘Excuse me, gents, if we are done with the day’s agenda, I want to share something. Sometime next month, our Japanese partner’s chairman is flying back to Tokyo from London. I invited him to stop by in Delhi. The good news is that he has agreed. I’m planning to host a gala dinner for him. Rudra, could you please manage the details?’ Immediately, Samarth jumped in, ‘Let’s hold this at The Oberoi. I’ve been to a few wonderful parties there.’ I ignored him. I made up my mind, at that instant, that the venue would be anywhere but The Oberoi. ‘I am looking at inviting around sixty couples, including key government officials and corporate heads,’ said Pratik and closed the meeting. The next day, I made a tentative reservation for a rooftop venue at The Taj Mahal Hotel, Mansingh Road, and one at The Oberoi too. At my next meeting with Pratik, I suggested the Taj Mansingh as the venue for the dinner. ‘Why don’t you look at The Oberoi as Samarth had suggested? My wife also feels it would be a great choice. Many of her friends often party there.’ Pratik’s wife was a prominent socialite, well known for the lavish parties that she threw. Celebrities from the film and cricketing world would be present often, and her PR team would ensure good coverage on Page Three of the leading newspapers. It was rumoured that she once had her husband pull his company’s advertisements from a major newspaper whose critic had panned one of her parties. I had to be careful in choosing the hotel now, as it was well known that no one dared to ignore his wife’s views. Not even Pratik! ‘I have made a tentative booking at The Oberoi too. But you know, we have held all of our dealer conferences at The Taj and I would like to leverage our position with them. And compared to The Oberoi, this hotel is more centrally located, especially for the government guests,’ I said, and before he could respond, I placed the menus from The Taj in front of him. ‘What’s this?’ ‘Since you are the host, I thought it best if you could help decide on the menu for that evening. The Taj has agreed to let us choose a mixed cuisine from amongst all their restaurants,’ I said, hoping to clinch the discussion on the venue. Pratik glanced at the menus and then turned towards me with an amused look: ‘Are you telling me that no one else, other than me, is capable of finalizing a good menu in this company?’ ‘No, I am not saying that, Pratik.’ ‘Then pray what exactly are you saying, Rudra?’ ‘All I am saying is that if you decide the menu, then no one will dare say it is not good,’ I said, emphasizing the words no one. He smiled, gathered all the menus and placed them inside his briefcase. ‘Let me pass these on to my wife. She is good at this, you know.’ I thought I had just won round one! The next day Pratik summoned me. ‘My wife has finalized this menu. And she is okay with the party being at Taj Mansingh.’ Round two to me! I made sure that Samarth and my other colleagues got to know of the venue only when the invitations reached them. On the evening of the big night, my wife and I reached The Taj early to check out the arrangements. As we entered the large, chandelier-filled rooftop hall, I could see that the large French windows enabled an amazing view of the city of Delhi. Pratik and his wife too arrived ahead of time, taking in and appreciating the details of the settings, especially the live jazz band playing soft music in the background. It was not too long before the guests started spilling out of the elevator. The Japanese chairman and his entourage were welcomed by Pratik and his wife and introduced to other dignitaries in the room. Gloved waiters served hors d’oeuvres and champagne, and guests formed their own circles. The chatter levels in the room soon rose, and people moved around trying to decide which group to join, depending on whom they knew or what was the subject of conversation. My colleagues and their wives had formed a group too. On seeing me, Samarth broke away from them and came over to where my wife and I were standing. ‘The Oberoi would have been a better venue,’ he said. I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. ‘The food over there is much better,’ he said. ‘Let’s wait till the food is served here,’ I said. He moved back to join his wife. ‘What’s his problem?’ asked my wife, her voice lowered. ‘Oh, think nothing of that. He just carries his attitude everywhere and tends to see every glass as half-empty,’ I said. My wife had heard about Samarth’s tendency to pass judgement on everybody and asked me to be careful. ‘Don’t worry I said. He is known to shoot off his mouth ever so often. He throws his weight around little realizing that the rest of us just tolerate him,’ I said. ‘I hear he is quite vindictive too,’ warned my wife. ‘Don’t worry darling, every organization has its fair share of such dick heads. Usually, one does not have to do anything to them. Don’t respond. Don’t react. They open their mouths so wide that they end up putting not only their shoes inside, but also a large part of their feet too. Then they trip and fall badly. These guys always wind up getting what they deserve. And don’t worry, I will be careful,’ I said. Two hours into the cocktails, soup was served. I saw Pratik’s wife move over to say hello to my colleagues and their wives. My wife and I joined that group and I signalled a waiter to serve our group. Samarth, as usual, tried to dominate the conversation. ‘I had suggested that we have this party at The Oberoi. The ambience and food over there is much better,’ he said. Pratik’s wife responded, ‘I have been having most of my parties there. I like that place.’ This was a cue for Samarth, ‘The vice president there is a good friend of mine. I had offered to get Rudra here some very good rates from them. But I guess he is not interested in saving some money for the company.’ Samarth’s wife looked at my wife, who in turn gave me a worried look. Thankfully, the waiter walked over with the soup before I could respond. Pratik’s wife picked up a bowl and turned sideways to talk to the lady to her right. Samarth, who was standing to her left, picked his bowl of soup, took a spoonful, looked towards me and in a slightly raised voice, said, ‘This soup tastes like dishwater!’ Upon hearing this, Pratik’s wife turned around, pursed her lips, glared at Samarth, and excused herself from the group. Samarth had once again managed to do the impossible! He had checkmated himself! Samarth was completely lost, not realizing the gravity of what had just happened. Some other members in the group were also trying to figure out the significance of the happenings. It was my turn now. I moved over, held Samarth softly by his arm and slowly manoeuvred him away from the group while he continued to look confused. ‘You should not have said that. Pratik’s wife heard what you said and she is obviously very upset,’ I whispered. ‘But why is she upset with what I said?’ he asked. The guy was really dumb. He could not be pretending. I decided to rub it in. This was my moment under the sun or, to be more precise, my moment under those bright chandeliers. ‘You really do not know,’ I said feigning sympathy and keeping my voice slightly above a whisper so that the others in the group could clearly hear me except Pratik’s wife, who had moved to the other corner of the hall and joined her husband and some of the Japanese guests. ‘Know what?’ he asked me still looking very perturbed. ‘That every item in the menu tonight was decided by Pratik’s wife.’ I had just landed the knockout blow. Samarth’s face turned ashen. He slowly walked away from the group and went and stood alone in one corner. His wife soon joined him. I think he realized that this could be his last supper in this company! He must have remembered how our administration manager was sacked a few months earlier for not responding in time to some work ordered by Pratik’s wife. I looked towards Samarth. For once, I felt very sorry for him. And sorrier for his wife who, for no fault of hers, had to suffer the worst because of what had just happened!",

      "content": "Preface In a career spanning three decades, working in the corporate sector and as a consultant, I have addressed thousands at engineering colleges and business management institutes and at other corporate forums. One question I’m often asked is, ‘What does it take to reach the top and stay there?’ Be it the fancy MBA graduate in a hurry to get to the top or the patient, hardworking manager slogging at the job for years or the usual sycophant who flatters his way up the corporate ladder, the C-Suite is the ultimate aspirational destination for everyone. To all of them the C-Suite is that hallowed office reserved for those whose designations start with the letter ‘C’, with titles that read chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer, chief people officer, chief technology officer and so on. My answers often comprised the usual ingredients: quality education, the right experience and the requisite expertise. I knew that there was more but was unable to get a full grip on what these really were. And then one day, I happened to see Martin Scorsese’s 1986 movie The Color of Money. There is a scene in which Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) tells Vincent (Tom Cruise) ‘I’ll tell you something, kiddo. You couldn’t find the big time if you had a road map. You got to be a student of human moves. See, all the greats that I know of were students of human moves.’ It suddenly struck me – how well this applied to the business world too. One had to be a student of human moves! Reaching the top and staying there is all about one’s ability to successfully navigate the undercurrents prevalent in the rarified environs of the C-Suite. It is how you sense and manage the egos, the politics, the insecurities, the hidden agendas and motivations of people and teams at the top. That’s not to say that such issues do not exist at lower levels. It’s just that at higher levels, egos are more fragile and insecurity is at its peak. I recall two events that exemplify this. The first one occurred in the year 2010. I was at the Atlantis in Dubai, having breakfast with a friend who happened to be the chief operating officer of an international bank. The global banking industry had just been through a major crisis. ‘Hope your job is safe?’ I asked him. ‘So far, so good,’ he said. And continued, ‘You know, at my level I will never lose my job because of incompetence. But yes, I could be thrown out tomorrow if I do not manage egos and insecurities amongst my colleagues at the top.’ The other event happened in New Delhi in 1998. One of our divisional heads walked into my room and placed on my desk the minutes of the last review meeting. He pointed to the first line that listed the names of all attendees. ‘Looks like the internal pecking order has changed again. Do you think there is a message for me? Earlier, I was at number three. Now I am at eleven.’ I had no answer. I was aware that our CEO always hand- wrote the minutes in order to reduce any transcription errors. That evening I decided to speak with the CEO. ‘Oh my god! Are our senior folk so insecure? I just write down the names in the order in which they sit around the table during the meeting,’ he said. From then on, all names in the minutes appeared in alphabetical order. I have worked at leadership levels across the globe in technology and brick-and-mortar companies and I believe the best way for anyone to understand what happens at higher levels in any company is to pick up a job as the executive assistant (EA) to the CEO and be the fly-on-the-wall in their office. But such opportunities are far and few in between, and I hope this book, of twenty-one short episodes, which are fictionalized accounts of real incidents over the course of my career, will provide you a ringside view of the C-Suite and what goes on in there. Each story has an embedded message that addresses the most pertinent issues of our work lives. Stories about the dilemma of being virtuous when the stakes are high, the pitfalls of judging a book by its cover, the dangers of blind ambition, ego squabbles among top brass that can damage a firm beyond repair, and many others. The stories are mostly drawn from a variety of Indian and trans-national companies, where, I can say with a certain degree of confidence, egos, insecurities, craving for visibility, survival strategies such as cover-your-ass (CYA) techniques, boot-licking, coteries, back-stabbing and chicanery are universal traits and are industry and culture agnostic. That does not mean that positive traits and qualities do not exist. They do and in great measure! But as is often said, when a dog bites a man it is staid news. And when a man bites a dog… Ah! That is different! This book attempts to take you on a journey that will help you understand the trials, tribulations, fun and pain that make life at the top so fascinating. It does not matter whether you are a student, a middle-or senior-level executive, or even someone occupying the C-Suite. By the time you finish reading this book, you will, hopefully, be wiser, smarter and better equipped to navigate and deal with the challenges that come your way and help you get ahead in business and in life. Every story needs a protagonist, an antagonist and a plot where conflicts arise and get resolved. I have tried to provide these in equal measure. I have attempted to keep the language simple, taking a cue from what William Faulkner is purported to have said about Ernest Hemingway: ‘He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary.’ The chapters can be read in no particular order, as every story is complete in itself. This is not the outcome of any kind of behavioural research and not meant to impart any gyaan. All I have done is picked up certain insights gained over years of observation and created short stories from these and I trust that the reader will find her/his own themes and lessons in these. Before you begin, permit me to leave you with a thought: In every organized set-up there are four kinds of people: The insecure ones, who often compete with their subordinates. The political beings, forever competing with their superiors. The mature folk who compete with their peers. And lastly, the true leaders who compete with themselves. Ask yourself, which category you currently belong to. And I hope that the insights gained from reading my stories help you decide where you want to be!",

      "content": "1 His Father’s Son Ten years ago, Param’s father retired from the Indian Army as a colonel. Param’s early memories of his home in Pune, while his father was still in service, were quite mixed. Two older brothers, his parents and two dogs lived in a spacious, red-tiled bungalow on a two-acre plot in the cantonment area. While life was comfortable, money was always in short supply. When new shoes were bought for the boys, they would always be a size or two larger. Cotton stuffing was used to make them fit and the boys had to literally grow into their shoes. As kids, they would avoid their father if they could. Not only was he a strict disciplinarian, with him it was always a case of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’. As a consequence, Param and his brothers spent most of their time at Major Krishnan’s place, not far from where they lived. The boys never understood why the Major admired their father so much, and they really did not care so long as he and his wife were kind to them. Param’s brothers joined the National Defence Academy at Khadakwasla immediately after completing school and eventually became commissioned army officers. Param was the only one still at home around the time his father retired. As they shifted from their large bungalow to a small, rented two-bedroom house, the reality of their life hit him. The government had provided virtually all of the furniture and fittings in the previous house. Whatever belonged to the family easily fitted into a few large wooden crates – that too provided by the army. That day, Param promised himself that in the days to come, his first priority would be to ensure complete financial security for himself. No matter what the circumstances, he would never allow himself to get to the kind of situation that his parents were in. Param moved on to complete his post-graduation from a prestigious management school and took up a lucrative job with a leading multinational company in Delhi. Every time he went home to meet his parents, he felt for them, especially for his mother. On one such occasion, he spoke to his father while they were having the morning tea. ‘Dad, you know I have a large, four-bedroom flat in Delhi. It’s too large for just my wife, our six-year-old son and me,’ said Param. His father looked up from the newspaper, ‘Then why don’t you move in to a smaller place. You will save some money too.’ To a neutral observer it would appear as if his father was being sarcastic. But Param knew that his father was quite a simple person and meant it in good faith. ‘I was wondering if Mom and you could move in with us, it would be beneficial to all of us.’ ‘Don’t worry. We will keep visiting once in a while,’ said his father. ‘No, no … That’s not what I meant, Dad. I would like you to come and stay with us permanently. This is the least I can do for all that you have done for us.’ ‘Param, what I did was my duty. I am sure tomorrow you will do the same for your son and wife. And don’t worry, this house and my pension are good enough for your mother and me,’ said his father and turned his attention back to the newspaper. Param was getting frustrated. He had hit a brick wall again. Why was his father always so self-righteous and refusing to see things from his point of view? He got up and walked over to the other room where his mother was ironing clothes. ‘Did you hear what he said, Mom?’ ‘Yes, I heard him. Did you expect a different response from him?’ she asked, carrying on with her chores. ‘Well, it’s been ten years since his retirement and I expected that by now he would get down from his high horse and face reality. You are staying in a rented place and the landlord can ask you to vacate any moment. And it’s not going to be easy for a retired person to rent another place so soon.’ ‘You know your father is a self-made man and has his own principles. And he would want his children to also have the same principles.’ ‘What principles are you speaking of, Mom? Something that denied us the smallest of things in life while our friends in the neighbourhood enjoyed the best of toys and gadgets? Are you talking of those principles that have denied him the capacity to even buy a house of his own after so many years of service? I want to have nothing to do with those principles.’ ‘I feel so sad that you just don’t understand these things.’ ‘I am happy this way, so let us be,’ said Param realizing that he had hit a wall with his mother too. Param left for Delhi the next day and continued to make frequent visits to Pune but never raised that topic again. A few years later, he joined a mid-sized company as the CEO. His salary virtually doubled and he moved to a larger apartment, in Gurgaon. As he sat in his spacious twelfth-floor office, looking out through the large French windows, his thoughts went back to how he would make one more effort to get his parents to come and stay with him. Param’s reverie was broken by a soft knock on his door. His secretary came in to drop off a file. It was his proposal to the company board about acquiring a company in Mumbai. This acquisition would make theirs the largest company in the market research outsourcing space. Once this was achieved, they could easily attract a major strategic investor from abroad. The board approved his proposal and gave him the mandate to initiate discussions. Once the due diligence process was complete, it was time for Param to travel to Mumbai to meet the chairman and founder of the company they wished to acquire. They met at a prominent hotel in Juhu. Param noticed how small his own hand was when they shook hands. The founder looked much taller and older than in his photos. He sported a small ponytail and his well-trimmed beard was more salt than pepper. The cleft on his chin was visible in spite of the beard. After exchanging pleasantries, Param got straight to the point. ‘By now, you would be aware of what your company is worth,’ he said. ‘I think I have a fair idea, Param. May I call you that? ‘Sure, sir,’ said Param, deferring to the other person’s age. ‘Why don’t you give me a number?’ ‘I’ve done the math and our best offer is two hundred crores,’ said Param. The man sitting in front of him shook his head slightly, leaned forward and lowered his voice. ‘Param, I want you to listen carefully. What I am going to say next must not go out of this room. I hope you understand?’ Param was not prepared for this. What was this man up to? ‘You have my word,’ he said. ‘Let me put it this way. You raise the offer to two hundred and forty crores and twenty crores of that is yours. That’s a lot of money, you know. And this price will only enhance the valuation of our merged entities.’ Param could hear his heart thumping loud. After thinking for a while, he stood up, extended his hand, and said, ‘I will try selling that to my board tomorrow.’ The next day he met the board members and apprised them of the new developments. He spoke to them as to why at even the new valuations it made sense to go through the acquisition. Some members asked a few questions and were satisfied with Param’s responses. And as he’d expected, the board cleared the new numbers. As an elated Param sat in his office contemplating his next move, his mother called. ‘Param, our landlord has served us notice to vacate the house. Your father is very worried, though he won’t show it.’ ‘Don’t worry, Mom. Can I speak to Dad?’ Param’s father came on to the line: ‘Yes, Param?’ ‘Mom just told me about the landlord. Dad, please do not worry. I have just concluded a major deal and will be coming into a lot of money. I’ll soon buy both of you a better house in Pune. I am thinking of Koregaon Park.’ ‘Koregaon Park?’ asked his father. ‘Isn’t that the most expensive real estate in Pune? Then you must be making a lot of money.’ ‘Yes, Dad, lots of money.’ ‘I hope all that is honest money, son.’ Param’s pent-up feelings burst out at that moment. ‘I know you will never appreciate anything I do. You seem to still hold it against me that I did not join the army. What has the army done for you? My brothers who are in the army will never, in their lifetime, be able to buy you and Mom your own house! I can and want to buy you a house and you question my integrity?’ ‘Param, the truth is, I am very proud of you and your achievements. But you are yet to answer my question. Is that honest money?’ ‘You know something, Dad? While we were kids, we had everything but money. You still live in a small, rented house. You know why? It’s because you have put yourself on top of this mountain called honesty and now you are trying to live up to that. I am a businessman, I don’t have such hang-ups.’ ‘Listen son, I brought you all up and gave you all a decent life, did I not? In my whole life, I have never done anything that has made me stoop low. And every night, I sleep with a clear conscience. I don’t want to change that. Not today, not ever!’ Param felt his rage rising. ‘I think you are honest only because you are scared of the consequences if found out.’ His father disconnected the call. Param was still seething when the phone rang again. It was his mother. ‘What did you just say to your father?’ she asked angrily. He told her of his plans to buy them a new house. ‘Listen Param, you kids will always feel that we never gave you what your friends’ parents gave them. We still did our best and gave you all a good life. At least it was the best we could do. And if all our children are doing well today, then somewhere we have contributed in a small way,’ she said, between sobs. ‘I am not denying that, Mom. But all I have wished for is to see you and Dad happy. And for him to be proud of me,’ said Param. His mother answered in a firm voice: ‘I have never seen your father this hurt. What makes you think we will be happy only if you buy us a better house? How little you know us! Never judge us till you can really put yourself in our shoes and understand our circumstances. If you really want your father to be proud of you, try and live up to his values.’ With that, she hung up. Param felt angry and helpless. He had wanted to help his parents but he felt they refused to understand him. He desperately wanted to talk to somebody, anybody, who would understand him and tell him he was not wrong. He decided to call Major Krishnan, who now lived in Chennai, after retirement. In the past he had often turned to him, a father figure, whenever he felt low or had to discuss some personal decisions. ‘Good evening, Uncle. Hope I am not disturbing you?’ said Param. ‘Nice to hear from you, Param! No, you are not disturbing me. I have all the time.’ Param then relayed the conversation with his parents and told him how even his mother had been unsympathetic. ‘What am I doing wrong? You tell me, Uncle.’ There was silence at the other end, and then he heard Major Krishnan take a deep breath. ‘Param, I want to tell you a real story concerning your father. No one other than your father and I know this. Maybe he has told your mother, but I don’t know about that.’ There was a pause. ‘While I was serving under your Dad, I lost my father, who was a teacher in Chennai. My mother and two sisters were fully dependent on me. When my sisters were to be married, I borrowed a large sum of money from some loan sharks. When these guys later pressed me to return the money, I did not have the funds. I was planning to seek help from an army contractor, something that would have been a serious breach of rules. When I mentioned this to your father, he dissuaded me saying it was unethical too. ‘Your father then sold off his small ancestral home in his village, borrowed some more from the bank, and paid off my debts. While he was still in service, he continued to pay monthly instalments to the bank. Later, when he retired from the army, he commuted part of his pension and paid the bank in full. I am yet to repay a large part of your father’s loan and not once has he reminded me. I hope you know now, why as kids you never had enough money or why your father still does not own a house!’ Major Krishnan’s voice was trembling, ‘ Your father is the most ethical person that I know!’ Param ended the conversation apologizing for not having understood his father. As he sat there mulling over his father’s story, Param came to a decision. He called the chairman and founder of the company he had plans to acquire and told him the board had not agreed to the enhanced price. The deal was off. He slept like a baby that night. At last, he felt proud of being a worthy son to his father.",

      "content": "1 His Father’s Son Ten years ago, Param’s father retired from the Indian Army as a colonel. Param’s early memories of his home in Pune, while his father was still in service, were quite mixed. Two older brothers, his parents and two dogs lived in a spacious, red-tiled bungalow on a two-acre plot in the cantonment area. While life was comfortable, money was always in short supply. When new shoes were bought for the boys, they would always be a size or two larger. Cotton stuffing was used to make them fit and the boys had to literally grow into their shoes. As kids, they would avoid their father if they could. Not only was he a strict disciplinarian, with him it was always a case of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’. As a consequence, Param and his brothers spent most of their time at Major Krishnan’s place, not far from where they lived. The boys never understood why the Major admired their father so much, and they really did not care so long as he and his wife were kind to them. Param’s brothers joined the National Defence Academy at Khadakwasla immediately after completing school and eventually became commissioned army officers. Param was the only one still at home around the time his father retired. As they shifted from their large bungalow to a small, rented two-bedroom house, the reality of their life hit him. The government had provided virtually all of the furniture and fittings in the previous house. Whatever belonged to the family easily fitted into a few large wooden crates – that too provided by the army. That day, Param promised himself that in the days to come, his first priority would be to ensure complete financial security for himself. No matter what the circumstances, he would never allow himself to get to the kind of situation that his parents were in. Param moved on to complete his post-graduation from a prestigious management school and took up a lucrative job with a leading multinational company in Delhi. Every time he went home to meet his parents, he felt for them, especially for his mother. On one such occasion, he spoke to his father while they were having the morning tea. ‘Dad, you know I have a large, four-bedroom flat in Delhi. It’s too large for just my wife, our six-year-old son and me,’ said Param. His father looked up from the newspaper, ‘Then why don’t you move in to a smaller place. You will save some money too.’ To a neutral observer it would appear as if his father was being sarcastic. But Param knew that his father was quite a simple person and meant it in good faith. ‘I was wondering if Mom and you could move in with us, it would be beneficial to all of us.’ ‘Don’t worry. We will keep visiting once in a while,’ said his father. ‘No, no … That’s not what I meant, Dad. I would like you to come and stay with us permanently. This is the least I can do for all that you have done for us.’ ‘Param, what I did was my duty. I am sure tomorrow you will do the same for your son and wife. And don’t worry, this house and my pension are good enough for your mother and me,’ said his father and turned his attention back to the newspaper. Param was getting frustrated. He had hit a brick wall again. Why was his father always so self-righteous and refusing to see things from his point of view? He got up and walked over to the other room where his mother was ironing clothes. ‘Did you hear what he said, Mom?’ ‘Yes, I heard him. Did you expect a different response from him?’ she asked, carrying on with her chores. ‘Well, it’s been ten years since his retirement and I expected that by now he would get down from his high horse and face reality. You are staying in a rented place and the landlord can ask you to vacate any moment. And it’s not going to be easy for a retired person to rent another place so soon.’ ‘You know your father is a self-made man and has his own principles. And he would want his children to also have the same principles.’ ‘What principles are you speaking of, Mom? Something that denied us the smallest of things in life while our friends in the neighbourhood enjoyed the best of toys and gadgets? Are you talking of those principles that have denied him the capacity to even buy a house of his own after so many years of service? I want to have nothing to do with those principles.’ ‘I feel so sad that you just don’t understand these things.’ ‘I am happy this way, so let us be,’ said Param realizing that he had hit a wall with his mother too. Param left for Delhi the next day and continued to make frequent visits to Pune but never raised that topic again. A few years later, he joined a mid-sized company as the CEO. His salary virtually doubled and he moved to a larger apartment, in Gurgaon. As he sat in his spacious twelfth-floor office, looking out through the large French windows, his thoughts went back to how he would make one more effort to get his parents to come and stay with him. Param’s reverie was broken by a soft knock on his door. His secretary came in to drop off a file. It was his proposal to the company board about acquiring a company in Mumbai. This acquisition would make theirs the largest company in the market research outsourcing space. Once this was achieved, they could easily attract a major strategic investor from abroad. The board approved his proposal and gave him the mandate to initiate discussions. Once the due diligence process was complete, it was time for Param to travel to Mumbai to meet the chairman and founder of the company they wished to acquire. They met at a prominent hotel in Juhu. Param noticed how small his own hand was when they shook hands. The founder looked much taller and older than in his photos. He sported a small ponytail and his well-trimmed beard was more salt than pepper. The cleft on his chin was visible in spite of the beard. After exchanging pleasantries, Param got straight to the point. ‘By now, you would be aware of what your company is worth,’ he said. ‘I think I have a fair idea, Param. May I call you that? ‘Sure, sir,’ said Param, deferring to the other person’s age. ‘Why don’t you give me a number?’ ‘I’ve done the math and our best offer is two hundred crores,’ said Param. The man sitting in front of him shook his head slightly, leaned forward and lowered his voice. ‘Param, I want you to listen carefully. What I am going to say next must not go out of this room. I hope you understand?’ Param was not prepared for this. What was this man up to? ‘You have my word,’ he said. ‘Let me put it this way. You raise the offer to two hundred and forty crores and twenty crores of that is yours. That’s a lot of money, you know. And this price will only enhance the valuation of our merged entities.’ Param could hear his heart thumping loud. After thinking for a while, he stood up, extended his hand, and said, ‘I will try selling that to my board tomorrow.’ The next day he met the board members and apprised them of the new developments. He spoke to them as to why at even the new valuations it made sense to go through the acquisition. Some members asked a few questions and were satisfied with Param’s responses. And as he’d expected, the board cleared the new numbers. As an elated Param sat in his office contemplating his next move, his mother called. ‘Param, our landlord has served us notice to vacate the house. Your father is very worried, though he won’t show it.’ ‘Don’t worry, Mom. Can I speak to Dad?’ Param’s father came on to the line: ‘Yes, Param?’ ‘Mom just told me about the landlord. Dad, please do not worry. I have just concluded a major deal and will be coming into a lot of money. I’ll soon buy both of you a better house in Pune. I am thinking of Koregaon Park.’ ‘Koregaon Park?’ asked his father. ‘Isn’t that the most expensive real estate in Pune? Then you must be making a lot of money.’ ‘Yes, Dad, lots of money.’ ‘I hope all that is honest money, son.’ Param’s pent-up feelings burst out at that moment. ‘I know you will never appreciate anything I do. You seem to still hold it against me that I did not join the army. What has the army done for you? My brothers who are in the army will never, in their lifetime, be able to buy you and Mom your own house! I can and want to buy you a house and you question my integrity?’ ‘Param, the truth is, I am very proud of you and your achievements. But you are yet to answer my question. Is that honest money?’ ‘You know something, Dad? While we were kids, we had everything but money. You still live in a small, rented house. You know why? It’s because you have put yourself on top of this mountain called honesty and now you are trying to live up to that. I am a businessman, I don’t have such hang-ups.’ ‘Listen son, I brought you all up and gave you all a decent life, did I not? In my whole life, I have never done anything that has made me stoop low. And every night, I sleep with a clear conscience. I don’t want to change that. Not today, not ever!’ Param felt his rage rising. ‘I think you are honest only because you are scared of the consequences if found out.’ His father disconnected the call. Param was still seething when the phone rang again. It was his mother. ‘What did you just say to your father?’ she asked angrily. He told her of his plans to buy them a new house. ‘Listen Param, you kids will always feel that we never gave you what your friends’ parents gave them.

      "content": "2 The Pink Envelope It was 1.30 a.m. The flight from Chennai was an hour late. Rajeev messaged his wife, Sri: ‘Just landed. Home in 45 minutes.’ Her reply was instant. ‘Okay. I’m awake.’ He messaged her again as he entered the elevator to get to his twenty-second-floor apartment at Hiranandani Gardens, Powai. She was waiting with the front door open and they walked softly, through the long corridor towards their bedroom, so as not to wake up his mother and their daughter, Arya. ‘How was the dinner on the flight? Do you want me to get you something?’ she asked. He answered in the negative and went into the bathroom. A few minutes later, as he slipped in under the comforter, she snuggled up to him. ‘Now tell me about this job offer you mentioned on the phone.’ ‘I met Sundar during lunch at the Nasscom conclave. He runs his own software company in Chennai.’ ‘And he made you an offer just like that?’ ‘Of course not, only after he had reached the conclusion that he would never find a better HR professional than me!’ Sri smiled and nudged him with her elbow. ‘You’re lucky I wasn’t there at that lunch!’ ‘I know and, for that, I shall be eternally grateful,’ he said. Rajeev and Sri had been classmates at IIM Ahmedabad. Both had majored in HR and she had been ahead of him in class. They landed jobs in Delhi through campus placement. A telecom software company hired him while she joined a consulting firm. Two years later they married. ‘So, you said yes?’ Rajeev could sense she was not too happy. ‘Of course not! I wanted to speak with you and then get back to him.’ ‘You realize this will be our third move in ten years,’ she said. ‘Sri, the compensation is great and I would be the HR head out there. And don’t you think Amma will be happier in Chennai?’ ‘I know, Rajeev. But then this will be your fifth job. We know that every time you take on a new assignment you are enthusiastic. And invariably, when things do not pan out as expected, you quit.’ ‘Oh, come on,’ he said. ‘Tell me I am wrong? We have been through this before,’ she said. ‘Arya is now seven and will need more stability with her schooling. And if I had not become a freelance training consultant, you know how difficult all this would be for us.’ ‘Don’t worry, Sri, it will work out fine this time and I promise not to quit for at least five years,’ said Rajeev, as he pulled her towards him in a warm embrace. During the first six months in his new job, Rajeev learnt many things about the company and about Sundar. Over 90 per cent of the company’s $200-million revenues came from working for an uncle’s fast-growing IT firm in the US. Profits were good and Sundar had hired many IIT and IIM alumni. Sundar had two elder brothers who, after getting their engineering degrees abroad, went to Harvard for their MBA. One was already involved in the family business. Sundar was lovingly referred to as the black sheep of the family. After completing his BCom, he had started this company with investments from his father. As the months went by, Sri was happy to see Rajeev settle down well at his new job. Sundar often sought his opinions on matters beyond HR, and this added to his confidence. Sri too picked up a few training assignments in Chennai, which kept her busy. Approximately a year later, Sri observed that Rajeev often kept to himself and was not his usual communicative self. ‘What’s eating you, Rajeev? Hope it’s nothing about us?’ she asked. ‘Of course not, Sri!’ ‘Then you must admit that something is bothering you.’ Rajeev sighed. There was no way out now. ‘Of late, I have noticed Sundar getting very unpredictable and authoritarian. He gets irritated often and humiliates some of the senior folk in public, for no fault of theirs.’ ‘Has he done that to you too?’ ‘Not yet, but I am tense that one day he may pick on me. Honestly, I don’t know how I would deal with that.’ ‘You said that Sundar often consults you on issues beyond HR,’ Sri said. It’s obvious that he values your advice. I am sure you having nothing to fear,’ she said hoping to allay Rajeev’s fears. ‘I understand what you are saying, Sri. But I suspect that at times when Sundar shouts at a person, he is indirectly targeting someone else.’ ‘I don’t get it. What exactly are you saying?’ ‘I have seen Sundar shout at a particular function head and talk of inefficiencies of some other function. If he shouts at me, I will put in my papers.’ Sri could sense that her worst fears were about to come true. Whenever her husband was confronted with a difficult situation, he always took the easy way out and quit. She had yet to see him take a stand. ‘Are revenues down?’ she asked. ‘No, in fact, this year is predicted to be a great one.’ ‘I wonder what’s bothering Sundar then? Authoritarian behaviour, we know, is a reflection of some deep-seated insecurity. Why don’t you try and talk to someone who has been there longer than you? They may have answers,’ she said looking to identify other causes for Sundar’s behaviour. ‘I will talk with our CFO tomorrow,’ replied Rajeev. He sought some time with the CFO the next day. ‘I suspect Sundar has an inferiority complex vis-à-vis his brothers. The younger one just returned from Harvard and has also joined the family business,’ said the CFO. ‘What is the connection?’ asked Rajeev. ‘I think one way for Sundar to assert his status within the family is to have many of us from the IITs and IIMs work for him. And remember, most of his business comes from his uncle in the US. So, he really does not care how we feel or respond.’ ‘But why humiliate people this way?’ ‘It’s his style not to directly confront some of us. He keeps picking on the same few and expects that the rest will fall in line out of fear.’ That evening, as Rajeev shared his feelings with Sri and asked for her views, she was happy to see him so involved in the topic. It was as if they were discussing another case study back in B-school. She somehow felt confident that on this occasion Rajeev would choose the ‘fight’ mode as opposed to the usual ‘flight’ mode. ‘How does one make Sundar stop humiliating people? After all, we know that people don’t change so easily,’ said Rajeev. ‘Well, you know we all have our worst nightmares and deep within our hearts we often dread that they may come true. I guess people could change when suddenly confronted with a real possibility that their worst nightmare may come true!’ said Sri. Something clicked in Rajeev’s head at that exact moment. ‘I think I just found the solution,’ said Rajeev, heading out of the room, and leaving Sri looking curious. She knew it was best to leave him alone when inspiration descended on him. The next day, as Rajeev left for his office, Sri noticed a sealed pink envelope jutting out of his shirt pocket. She raised her eyebrows, but Rajeev merely smiled. And every day, over the next five days, Sri noticed that he diligently placed the pink envelope in the same way in his shirt pocket. On the fifth day, Sundar called Rajeev to his room. ‘What’s this pink envelope you’ve been carrying around?’ Sundar asked, pointing to Rajeev’s pocket, as he was taking a seat. ‘I am glad you finally noticed, Sundar. That’s my resignation letter in there.’ ‘What? Is this some kind of a joke?’ asked a flustered Sundar. ‘No, Sundar. This really is my resignation letter.’ ‘But why would you resign? You know I value your contribution here. Is there anything you are dissatisfied with?’ ‘Now that you ask, let me be honest with you. I am very happy here and I know you value and appreciate my contribution. But what bothers me, and please don’t get me wrong, is the way I see you humiliate some of the senior folk at times.’ ‘But you know I only shout at those who are inefficient.’ ‘I know that, Sundar. But I am worried that in case for some reason you do shout at me, I will not be able to take it. The only way out for me, if that happens, would be to immediately give you this pink envelope.’ ‘How can you say that, Rajeev? You, of all people here, know that you are more like an advisor to me,’ Sundar protested. ‘Then, in that case, Sundar, I would be failing you if I did not point out that the stakes for you in this are much higher than for any of us.’ ‘Of course, I know that. I own this company.’ ‘I don’t mean it that way. Just imagine what would happen if, one day, when you shout at someone in public, that person turns around and shouts back at you. Where would that leave you?’ Sundar fell silent; he had a serious look on his face. Rajeev was worried he had crossed the line. The two of them sat across each other – Sundar staring at Rajeev and the latter, head bent, looking at his hands, kept folded on his lap. After what seemed an eternity, Sundar stood up, walked over to where Rajeev was seated, took out the envelope from his pocket, opened it, pulled out the resignation letter, tore it up, walked around to the waste paper basket, and threw it in. He then took the pink envelope, pinned it to the centre of the board behind his chair, and said with a smile, ‘That should serve as a constant reminder to me. And please, let this remain between us!’ That night, Sri was comforted to see Rajeev very relaxed. He gave her a complete rundown of what transpired that day right up to the point when Sundar had pinned the pink envelope on the board to serve as a reminder for him. ‘So you think Sundar will change his behaviour?’ she asked. ‘I am sure of that,’ replied Rajeev. ‘How can you be so sure? People don’t change just like that.’ ‘I guess Sundar realized that someone shouting back at him publicly could be his worst nightmare coming true. That was the real and present danger.’ ‘I guess you are right,’ said a visibly happy Sri.",

She had yet to see him take a stand. ‘Are revenues down?’ she asked. ‘No, in fact, this year is predicted to be a great one.’ ‘I wonder what’s bothering Sundar then? Authoritarian behaviour, we know, is a reflection of some deep-seated insecurity. Why don’t you try and talk to someone who has been there longer than you? They may have answers,’ she said looking to identify other causes for Sundar’s behaviour. ‘I will talk with our CFO tomorrow,’ replied Rajeev. He sought some time with the CFO the next day. ‘I suspect Sundar has an inferiority complex vis-à-vis his brothers. The younger one just returned from Harvard and has also joined the family business,’ said the CFO. ‘What is the connection?’ asked Rajeev. ‘I think one way for Sundar to assert his status within the family is to have many of us from the IITs and IIMs work for him. And remember, most of his business comes from his uncle in the US. So, he really does not care how we feel or respond.’ ‘But why humiliate people this way?’ ‘It’s his style not to directly confront some of us. He keeps picking on the same few and expects that the rest will fall in line out of fear.’ That evening, as Rajeev shared his feelings with Sri and asked for her views, she was happy to see him so involved in the topic. It was as if they were discussing another case study back in B-school. She somehow felt confident that on this occasion Rajeev would choose the ‘fight’ mode as opposed to the usual ‘flight’ mode. ‘How does one make Sundar stop humiliating people? After all, we know that people don’t change so easily,’ said Rajeev. ‘Well, you know we all have our worst nightmares and deep within our hearts we often dread that they may come true. I guess people could change when suddenly confronted with a real possibility that their worst nightmare may come true!’ said Sri. Something clicked in Rajeev’s head at that exact moment. ‘I think I just found the solution,’ said Rajeev, heading out of the room, and leaving Sri looking curious. She knew it was best to leave him alone when inspiration descended on him. The next day, as Rajeev left for his office, Sri noticed a sealed pink envelope jutting out of his shirt pocket. She raised her eyebrows, but Rajeev merely smiled. And every day, over the next five days, Sri noticed that he diligently placed the pink envelope in the same way in his shirt pocket. On the fifth day, Sundar called Rajeev to his room. ‘What’s this pink envelope you’ve been carrying around?’ Sundar asked, pointing to Rajeev’s pocket, as he was taking a seat. ‘I am glad you finally noticed, Sundar. That’s my resignation letter in there.’ ‘What? Is this some kind of a joke?’ asked a flustered Sundar. ‘No, Sundar. This really is my resignation letter.’ ‘But why would you resign? You know I value your contribution here. Is there anything you are dissatisfied with?’ ‘Now that you ask, let me be honest with you. I am very happy here and I know you value and appreciate my contribution. But what bothers me, and please don’t get me wrong, is the way I see you humiliate some of the senior folk at times.’ ‘But you know I only shout at those who are inefficient.’ ‘I know that, Sundar. But I am worried that in case for some reason you do shout at me, I will not be able to take it. The only way out for me, if that happens, would be to immediately give you this pink envelope.’ ‘How can you say that, Rajeev? You, of all people here, know that you are more like an advisor to me,’ Sundar protested. ‘Then, in that case, Sundar, I would be failing you if I did not point out that the stakes for you in this are much higher than for any of us.’ ‘Of course, I know that. I own this company.’ ‘I don’t mean it that way. Just imagine what would happen if, one day, when you shout at someone in public, that person turns around and shouts back at you. Where would that leave you?’ Sundar fell silent; he had a serious look on his face. Rajeev was worried he had crossed the line. The two of them sat across each other – Sundar staring at Rajeev and the latter, head bent, looking at his hands, kept folded on his lap. After what seemed an eternity, Sundar stood up, walked over to where Rajeev was seated, took out the envelope from his pocket, opened it, pulled out the resignation letter, tore it up, walked around to the waste paper basket, and threw it in. He then took the pink envelope, pinned it to the centre of the board behind his chair, and said with a smile, ‘That should serve as a constant reminder to me. And please, let this remain between us!’ That night, Sri was comforted to see Rajeev very relaxed. He gave her a complete rundown of what transpired that day right up to the point when Sundar had pinned the pink envelope on the board to serve as a reminder for him. ‘So you think Sundar will change his behaviour?’ she asked. ‘I am sure of that,’ replied Rajeev. ‘How can you be so sure? People don’t change just like that.’ ‘I guess Sundar realized that someone shouting back at him publicly could be his worst nightmare coming true. That was the real and present danger.’ ‘I guess you are right,’ said a visibly happy Sri.",

She wanted to call her parents immediately and share the good news. She, however, decided to call them the next day, as it would be midnight in Mumbai at that hour. Tuesday, 11 September 2001. Shreya had set her alarm for 10 a.m. as the first lecture was scheduled at noon. She woke with a start to the loud ringing of her phone. Still not fully awake, she glanced at her bedside clock; it showed 9.30 a.m. She reached for the phone and pressed it to her ear and immediately held it away. ‘Hello Shreya, hope you are safe, baby?’ her mother, calling from Mumbai, was practically screaming into the phone. ‘I am fine, Ma. Why are you shouting? Hope all is well?’ ‘Why are you not watching the TV? They are showing planes crashing into tall buildings in New York. Please come back immediately. That place is not safe anymore.’ Her mother was incoherent. Shreya had to raise her voice, ‘Is Daddy there? I want to speak with him.’ Her father came on the phone and spoke in a calm voice, ‘Shreya, we are watching CNN. Apparently, this morning in New York, some terrorists have hijacked a few planes. Two of these have been flown straight into the World Trade Center towers. Hope you are fine?’ She heard her mother in the background, shouting at her father, ‘Please ask her to come back at once.’ ‘Dad, please assure mummy that I am fine. I have just got up and need to see what’s happening here. I will call you in an hour’s time.’ Shreya was worried about her mother, who was a heart patient. Two hours later, she spoke with her father. She informed him that things seemed to be under control and that there was no need to panic. She then told him about the internship offer from The Washington Post. He congratulated Shreya and informed her that he had convinced her mother that it was safe for Shreya to complete her graduation, which was just ten months away, and then return to Mumbai permanently. He reminded her about her mother’s heart condition and convinced her that this was the only option. He put his wife on the phone. ‘I am very worried for you Shreya,’ she said. ‘I have agreed to your completing your studies there only on one condition. You must call me every day. Once in the morning and once just before going to bed.’ Shreya agreed to this and promised that she would return immediately once she graduated. ‘Thank you, Shreya. I am sure you will get a good job here,’ said her mother. Shreya felt devastated. Her dreams of working in the US had been blown away just as the twin towers had collapsed. After a series of videoconference interviews with a few national newspapers in India, she accepted an offer for a sub-editor’s position at Mumbai’s leading daily. Her reasons for choosing this particular publication went beyond her need to be at home with her parents. The editor, Siddhartha (Sid), was an alumnus of Columbia School of Journalism and he was a well-respected voice in media circles in India. Shreya graduated in the summer of 2002 and was soon on the flight to Mumbai. Her mother was elated to have her little girl back at home. After taking a few days’ break to catch up with some of her school friends, Shreya reported to work. She was in complete awe of Sid when she met him in person. He welcomed her warmly and spoke to her about the company, its history, and culture. He displayed great patience while answering her questions and encouraged her to meet him if she ever had any issues. When the meeting was over, he walked her to the door. After that, she met her boss, the deputy editor, who later introduced her to the other four sub-editors. Shreya soon hit the ground running. She was an active participant in the morning review meetings and offered many a suggestion. In order to foster greater collaboration within the team, the deputy editor encouraged them to critique one another’s work. While the deputy editor admired Shreya’s openness and zeal, she sensed that her colleagues were not too enthused by her behaviour. She observed that the other four would be together at lunch while Shreya would be seated at another table. Was she being subtly ostracized? The deputy editor shared her observations with Sid. ‘Is there a natural leader amongst the other four girls?’ asked Sid. ‘I think that is Priya. The others are often influenced by her.’ ‘Why not put Shreya and Priya to work together on a story? That may get them closer and once that happens the rest will also accept her,’ said Sid. Shreya was super excited about working on an important story. Priya and she really put their everything into it and were seen working late into the evenings. Shreya did most of the research and, a week later, the story was ready. It would go to print once it was cleared by the deputy editor. Shreya’s mother fell sick the next day and Shreya was forced to stay at home for a few days. Three days later, she was back at work and was delighted to see their story on the front page that morning as the second lead. She read the story and was elated that most of her points were carried with very little editing. As her eyes moved up, she suddenly felt very sick. The byline carried only one name – Priya. Disgusted, she confronted the deputy editor with a copy of the newspaper. ‘You know I worked my back off for this story. How could you clear it without my name in the byline?’ she demanded. ‘Look Shreya, I was not in yesterday. I saw it this morning and I wanted to ask you why you had not put your name in this story,’ replied the deputy editor. ‘Oh, it is Priya then! I am sorry,’ said Shreya, and rushed out. Priya and her colleagues were standing around the coffee machine. ‘How could you do this?’ shouted Shreya, waving the newspaper in front of Priya’s face. ‘Do what?’ asked Priya with an innocent look. ‘Leave my name out in the byline of our story!’ Priya still looked unflustered. ‘Let me see … Oh yes, your name is missing. I am so sorry. Looks like I forgot to add it when I sent in the final copy for Sid’s approval.’ As Shreya stood there, fuming, another colleague stepped in. ‘Please don’t make a fuss, Shreya. Sometimes these things happen. And Priya has apologized, hasn’t she?’ Shreya looked around and noticed that many of the other staff members on their floor had stopped doing what they were doing and were staring in her direction. ‘Okay,’ said Shreya and walked in the direction of her cubicle. She could hear the other sub-editors snicker as she turned her back on them. She decided to take it up with Sid. Shreya looked distraught as she related her story to Sid. She started from the beginning and till the point when Priya had intentionally kept her name out of the credits. Sid listened with empathy and then spoke in a calm, measured tone: ‘Let us, for a moment, assume that Priya did intentionally drop your name from the credits. Why would she do that?’ ‘Because she is jealous of me and is insecure.’ ‘And what makes her jealous and insecure?’ ‘Not just her, even the other three sub-editors have this problem.’ ‘Is it about them or is it about you, Shreya?’ ‘I don’t understand what you mean. Now I am to be blamed? I might as well just quit.’ ‘Is their behaviour an intrinsic part of their DNA or merely a reaction to something you could have said or done inadvertently? And by the way, you don’t solve anything by quitting.’ ‘I really don’t know,’ said Shreya. ‘Remember, people often have preconceived notions about us. The other girls, who are all graduates from the prestigious Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, underwent a rigorous selection process to get here. They know you are from a famous international journalism school, and all you went through was a video conference interview with me. How would you feel if you were any of them?’ ‘I guess I would think that I am privileged,’ replied Shreya. ‘And what else?’ prodded Sid. ‘And that I would come with a chip on my shoulder.’ ‘And…’ ‘And they would see attitude in everything I said or did. Even if I did not mean it.’ ‘Exactly! And do you think anything like that happened here?’ Shreya thought for a while and lowered her eyes and said, ‘Well, I think at times…’ ‘Can you recollect any critical incident?’ ‘Well, I guess in my eagerness to prove myself, I could have stepped on a few toes. My efforts to give feedback were genuine, but they may have seen this as a superiority complex.’ ‘More so, if I route the feedback through my superior rather than give it privately to them, don’t you think?’ enquired Sid. How did Sid know, Shreya wondered. She replied, ‘I see what you mean, Sid.’ ‘And remember, the other four have known each other for many years before you came on the scene. So, if one of them feels hurt or insecure about you, the others will all reflect this feeling even if they have not experienced it themselves.’ ‘Yes, I can recall such instances. So, what should I do?’ asked Shreya. ‘If I were you, I would try and build a rapport with them first as individuals and then as a group.’ ‘Thanks a lot, Sid. I guess, when I point a finger at someone I need to see the other three fingers pointing back at me,’ said Shreya with a slight laugh. ‘And finally, remember one cardinal rule: In life, no person is an island. And this is always true in an organizational setting. Even the smartest and brightest person can only succeed if they learn to collaborate as equals,’ said Sid. As Shreya thanked Sid and walked out of his cabin, she realized that not even once did she feel that he was judging her.",

      "content": "4 Judging a Book by Its Cover ‘This would never have happened if only you had listened to me,’ yelled Urmila. ‘Sure, and hindsight is always 20/20,’ Aman retorted. ‘You seem to put your future repeatedly in Ranjit’s hands. And see where we are now!’ she hit back. Aman sensed that his wife was reaching a breaking point. ‘I know, Urmi, but we cannot blame Ranjit for everything. Don’t worry, something will come up soon,’ he said, trying to calm her. It was day 75 of his of 90-day notice period. He had sent his resume to 25 companies. Not a single response! Aman and Ranjit went back a long way. To a time before Urmila arrived in the scene. It was in 1988 that Aman had graduated in textile engineering and joined a leading textile company in north India. He was assigned to work under Ranjit, the business head. Aman and Ranjit hit it off well, even though the latter was twelve years senior to Aman. Both had a love for the outdoors. Ranjit was into photography and made it a point to carry his camera along on his travels abroad. They would often travel together on business trips and made sure they visited as many tourist spots as possible. One night, when Ranjit returned early from one of his long trips and opened his apartment door with the key that he used to carry, he heard laughter coming from his bedroom. He barged in. His wife was lying in the arms of another man whom he did not recognize. With a shocked look on her face she quickly stood up and wrapped herself in a bed sheet. The other man too got out of bed and walked slowly towards his clothes spread on the sofa in the far corner. He was taller than Ranjit, younger, and better built too. The way he nonchalantly looked at Ranjit while he dressed seemed as if he was daring him to make a move. Ranjit moved away from the door as the other man walked out. His wife stood in the corner looking at her feet. ‘You can get out of that bed sheet and get dressed,’ he said, as he sat down on the bed, his head in his hands. A zillion thoughts were racing through his mind, none of which made sense. Something deep within him suddenly snapped. How could she? He loved her so much. And now this? She put on her clothes and turned towards Ranjit. He raised his head with a look that clearly asked: Why? That was her cue, probably. ‘What do you expect me to do? You are always away on those long trips. God knows doing what!’ He said nothing and moved out of the flat to a service apartment. They divorced a year later. And he never married again. Ranjit was the best man at Aman’s marriage and Urmila was happy to see how Aman and he got along so well. However, as the months went by, Urmila’s fondness for Ranjit waned. She did not like the fact that Aman spent so much time away from home and she blamed this on the fact that Ranjit was divorced and had no family to come home to. As it is, she did not like men who were divorcees. Urmila finally forced Aman to find another job and move away from Ranjit. Six years later, Ranjit again connected with Aman. ‘Hi, Ranjit what a surprise hearing from you. What has it been… six years now?’ Aman said, answering the phone. ‘That’s right, Aman. How are you doing? How are Urmila and the twins?’ ‘All fine, Ranjit. How are you? Where are you now?’ ‘I am moving to head a company in Noida that has been acquired by a US textile giant. I am hoping you will join me as the marketing head.’ ‘Ranjit, you know Urmila and the kids are well settled here, and I really enjoy my work.’ ‘Aman, why don’t we do this? Let’s set up a call for tomorrow at 3 p.m. and I will tell you more. Please convey my regards to Urmila. Good night for now.’ ‘All right. Good night.’ Urmila, who had overheard Aman’s side of the conversation, waited for him to speak. ‘You remember Ranjit?’ he said. ‘He has picked up a great job with a US-based company and wants me to join him in Noida.’ ‘Aman, we are so well settled here.’ Urmila did not sound too happy. ‘I know. But let us hear him out at least. I have a call with him tomorrow afternoon.’ Aman said. ‘Has he remarried?’ ‘How would I know?’ replied Aman with a frown. He was aware that Urmila blamed Ranjit for the divorce. ‘I think Ranjit wants you there purely for his own selfish needs. I don’t want you to put our future in his hands again,’ said Urmila. ‘I don’t have a good feeling about this at all! These US companies are, in any case, famous for shutting down operations at the slightest headwind.’ Urmila tried her best to dissuade Aman from accepting Ranjit’s offer. She finally gave in when she saw how keen Aman was, as she did not want to carry the blame later. Life in Noida was a clear upgrade for Aman and Urmila. The company-leased apartment was spacious with many added amenities. Aman travelled abroad often. They now holidayed in Thailand and Singapore, courtesy the many frequent flyer miles that he had accumulated. Everyone was happy, but good times rarely last forever! A Chinese company bought out the Asia operations of their company. The Indian operations would now focus on supplying yarn and fabric to China where these would be converted to finished products. The marketing function was shut down in India and Aman and his teams were laid off with ninety days’ notice. The two of them were clearly devastated, and Urmila’s animosity towards Ranjit multiplied a thousand-fold. ‘I am sure he would have known a long time ago that this was to happen. Had he given us enough warning, by now you would have found another job,’ she said. ‘I don’t think he knew this would happen. This whole deal must have been done overseas, with India playing no role,’ said Aman defending Ranjit. ‘I don’t believe that. And why do you continue defending him? He has not been laid off,’ said Urmila. A few days after their fight, Aman informed Urmila, ‘Ranjit wants to come over for coffee tomorrow.’ She was not pleased but relented. The next day, as Ranjit stepped into their apartment, he could sense Urmila’s hostility. ‘Anything has come up, Aman?’ he asked. Aman shook his head, ‘Nothing yet Ranjit, and I am starting to give up hope.’ Aman was on the verge of tears and Urmila came over and sat next to him as if to console him. ‘This would never have happened if we had stayed in Pune. We don’t have much saved up as it is. Most of our savings were used up in buying a house for Aman’s parents and in the down payment for our apartment in Bangalore. After fifteen days, we really don’t know what we’re going to do or where we will go,’ she said, tears forming in her eyes. Ranjit inhaled sharply and said, ‘I feel bad for what has happened. I may not be affected right now, but I don’t think they will want me around for long. But that’s not why I came here.’ Urmila and Aman looked confused. ‘What I am going to say may be a bit personal but please don’t misunderstand me. I consider you both as family and, in a way, I feel responsible for what has happened.’ ‘Please don’t say that,’ said Aman. ‘How could you know this would happen?’ ‘I can see you both are tense because the notice period runs out in the next fifteen days. Just tell me what would you estimate your bare minimum monthly expenses to be?’ Aman and Urmila looked at each other. They did not know where Ranjit was going with this. Aman quickly calculated a rough figure of Rs 150,000 a month, including the EMI for their apartment. Ranjit drew out his cheque-book from his pocket and wrote out a cheque for Rs 18 lakh. He handed it over to Aman and said, ‘Please don’t get me wrong. I have some money in a fixed deposit. Please take this as a loan and now assume that you have another 12 months to find a new job. You don’t need to stress yourself any more, and believe me, something will surely work out.’ The shock they felt was written all over Aman’s and Urmila’s faces. Ranjit continued, ‘People fight too many shadows on being laid off. They assume that their current lifestyle is the bare minimum required for survival and wonder how they would manage. But that’s not really the case. The most important thing is to remember that lay-offs are a reality now and never let it impact your self-worth.’ Urmila looked at Aman and then at Ranjit. She had been so wrong about Ranjit. They decided to accept Ranjit’s offer. Four months later, Aman found a job, and soon, repaid Ranjit’s loan. The difficult days were behind them and the whole experience had made them stronger and wiser. They vowed not to splurge till they had a sizeable amount, at least a year’s expenses, in the bank. But most importantly, Urmila learnt never to judge a book by its cover.",

And see where we are now!’ she hit back. Aman sensed that his wife was reaching a breaking point. ‘I know, Urmi, but we cannot blame Ranjit for everything. Don’t worry, something will come up soon,’ he said, trying to calm her. It was day 75 of his of 90-day notice period. He had sent his resume to 25 companies. Not a single response! Aman and Ranjit went back a long way. To a time before Urmila arrived in the scene. It was in 1988 that Aman had graduated in textile engineering and joined a leading textile company in north India. He was assigned to work under Ranjit, the business head. Aman and Ranjit hit it off well, even though the latter was twelve years senior to Aman. Both had a love for the outdoors. Ranjit was into photography and made it a point to carry his camera along on his travels abroad. They would often travel together on business trips and made sure they visited as many tourist spots as possible. One night, when Ranjit returned early from one of his long trips and opened his apartment door with the key that he used to carry, he heard laughter coming from his bedroom. He barged in. His wife was lying in the arms of another man whom he did not recognize. With a shocked look on her face she quickly stood up and wrapped herself in a bed sheet. The other man too got out of bed and walked slowly towards his clothes spread on the sofa in the far corner. He was taller than Ranjit, younger, and better built too. The way he nonchalantly looked at Ranjit while he dressed seemed as if he was daring him to make a move. Ranjit moved away from the door as the other man walked out. His wife stood in the corner looking at her feet. ‘You can get out of that bed sheet and get dressed,’ he said, as he sat down on the bed, his head in his hands. A zillion thoughts were racing through his mind, none of which made sense. Something deep within him suddenly snapped. How could she? He loved her so much. And now this? She put on her clothes and turned towards Ranjit. He raised his head with a look that clearly asked: Why? That was her cue, probably. ‘What do you expect me to do? You are always away on those long trips. God knows doing what!’ He said nothing and moved out of the flat to a service apartment. They divorced a year later. And he never married again. Ranjit was the best man at Aman’s marriage and Urmila was happy to see how Aman and he got along so well. However, as the months went by, Urmila’s fondness for Ranjit waned. She did not like the fact that Aman spent so much time away from home and she blamed this on the fact that Ranjit was divorced and had no family to come home to. As it is, she did not like men who were divorcees. Urmila finally forced Aman to find another job and move away from Ranjit. Six years later, Ranjit again connected with Aman. ‘Hi, Ranjit what a surprise hearing from you. What has it been… six years now?’ Aman said, answering the phone. ‘That’s right, Aman. How are you doing? How are Urmila and the twins?’ ‘All fine, Ranjit. How are you? Where are you now?’ ‘I am moving to head a company in Noida that has been acquired by a US textile giant. I am hoping you will join me as the marketing head.’ ‘Ranjit, you know Urmila and the kids are well settled here, and I really enjoy my work.’ ‘Aman, why don’t we do this? Let’s set up a call for tomorrow at 3 p.m. and I will tell you more. Please convey my regards to Urmila. Good night for now.’ ‘All right. Good night.’ Urmila, who had overheard Aman’s side of the conversation, waited for him to speak. ‘You remember Ranjit?’ he said. ‘He has picked up a great job with a US-based company and wants me to join him in Noida.’ ‘Aman, we are so well settled here.’ Urmila did not sound too happy. ‘I know. But let us hear him out at least. I have a call with him tomorrow afternoon.’ Aman said. ‘Has he remarried?’ ‘How would I know?’ replied Aman with a frown. He was aware that Urmila blamed Ranjit for the divorce. ‘I think Ranjit wants you there purely for his own selfish needs. I don’t want you to put our future in his hands again,’ said Urmila. ‘I don’t have a good feeling about this at all! These US companies are, in any case, famous for shutting down operations at the slightest headwind.’ Urmila tried her best to dissuade Aman from accepting Ranjit’s offer. She finally gave in when she saw how keen Aman was, as she did not want to carry the blame later. Life in Noida was a clear upgrade for Aman and Urmila. The company-leased apartment was spacious with many added amenities. Aman travelled abroad often. They now holidayed in Thailand and Singapore, courtesy the many frequent flyer miles that he had accumulated. Everyone was happy, but good times rarely last forever! A Chinese company bought out the Asia operations of their company. The Indian operations would now focus on supplying yarn and fabric to China where these would be converted to finished products. The marketing function was shut down in India and Aman and his teams were laid off with ninety days’ notice. The two of them were clearly devastated, and Urmila’s animosity towards Ranjit multiplied a thousand-fold. ‘I am sure he would have known a long time ago that this was to happen. Had he given us enough warning, by now you would have found another job,’ she said. ‘I don’t think he knew this would happen. This whole deal must have been done overseas, with India playing no role,’ said Aman defending Ranjit. ‘I don’t believe that. And why do you continue defending him? He has not been laid off,’ said Urmila. A few days after their fight, Aman informed Urmila, ‘Ranjit wants to come over for coffee tomorrow.’ She was not pleased but relented. The next day, as Ranjit stepped into their apartment, he could sense Urmila’s hostility. ‘Anything has come up, Aman?’ he asked. Aman shook his head, ‘Nothing yet Ranjit, and I am starting to give up hope.’ Aman was on the verge of tears and Urmila came over and sat next to him as if to console him. ‘This would never have happened if we had stayed in Pune.

      "content": "5 Collaborators in the Time of Corporate Takeovers Ayesha was faced with a dilemma, but happy to be in that situation. She had topped her class at IIM Bangalore and had already received an attractive job offer from one of the big four consulting firms. And now, here she was, seated in front of Utkarsh, the CEO of a fast-growing software company, who had just made her an offer. Actually, two offers. ‘You can come in as an assistant manager in our strategy team or you can join as my executive assistant, or EA,’ he said. ‘Which of these two has better prospects?’ she asked. ‘Both have good prospects. But please remember, if you come in as my EA, you will have a ringside seat in my office as a fly on the wall. You will observe and be involved in matters they never teach at any management institute. And you can later move into a key position in any of the verticals.’ Ayesha chose to join as Utkarsh’s EA as he was not only well respected in industry associations but also a much sought-after speaker at various national and international forums. She never regretted her decision. The many hours she spent working on Utkarsh’s speeches provided her with rare insights into his mind. He truly cared for and believed in his people. Not once did she hear him pass judgement on any person or hurt someone’s dignity. He handpicked and nurtured his team and his only demand from them was ‘no surprises in their areas of work’. In return, he assured them that he would always be there for them. His favourite and oft-repeated quote was, ‘We will always remain a great team so long as we continue to talk “to” each other just the way we talk “about” one another.’ It was no surprise that Utkarsh soon became her role model. Ayesha was with Utkarsh in his office one afternoon when he received a phone call. ‘Yes, please put him through,’ said Utkarsh to Ayesha. ‘Hello, yes, this is Utkarsh. Good afternoon.’ He paused, listening intently. He continued, ‘Yes, I was expecting your call. When would your team like to come over? Please let me have your contact numbers and I will have our CFO co-ordinate this. Thank you … and you too.’ The call took no more than a minute or two, but Ayesha had never seen anyone age so suddenly in so short a time. ‘Hope all is well, Utkarsh,’ she said, concerned. ‘Yes, Ayesha. Just need a moment to catch my breath.’ She waited. ‘That call was from the Mumbai office of a New York-based investment bank. They have a mandate from our US parent-company to find a suitable buyer for us. You would have observed that I let them believe that I was expecting their call,’ he said. Their company was a listed entity in India, with the majority of shares held by an American company. Utkarsh spoke as if talking to himself: ‘I am the CEO here, yet no one had the courtesy to keep me informed. I guess that is the reality of corporate life.’ Events moved quickly after the call. Data-rooms were set up and three likely buyers spent time in completing the due diligence process. In about three months the company changed hands. The new owner was a large telecom hardware manufacturer, headquartered in North Carolina, with production facilities in USA, Europe, China and Singapore. Utkarsh now reported to Ronnie, who was based in the US and was in charge of Asia. Post the acquisition, Ronnie spent twenty days in India meeting with Utkarsh and other key members. He was happy to note that Utkarsh was highly respected by all employees and enjoyed great credibility amongst clients in all geographies as well as with industry associations, analysts and the media. The India operations continued to deliver outstanding results. The quarterly board reviews were now held in Charlotte, North Carolina, to which Utkarsh and his team flew out from Bangalore. During one such meeting, the chairman was all praise for the way Utkarsh continued to grow the India business and observed that Ronnie could learn a few things from Utkarsh. As time went by, Utkarsh was often invited to the US to participate in strategic discussions involving the parent company’s businesses in other geographies. Ayesha soon sensed a perceptible change in Ronnie’s behaviour on his subsequent trips to India. Unlike in his earlier visits, he now spent less time with Utkarsh and spent more time individually with each of his direct reportees. Utkarsh was happy that his team members had the opportunity to get better exposure and earn more visibility. Only if he had known what Ronnie was up to! During his one-on-one meetings with Utkarsh’s direct reportees, Ronnie enquired if they could manage the company in case Utkarsh was moved to another geography. Ambition and greed soon came to the fore. Seizing the opportunity, each of them assured Ronnie that Utkarsh had functioned mostly as an administrative head, managing the industry associations and the media. When it came to client relationships, business acquisitions, and managing delivery, it was they who really ran the show, they said. Vidur, the global sales head, particularly impressed Ronnie. A week later, all employees received Ronnie’s email. Utkarsh was leaving for personal reasons and Vidur would be the new CEO. Ronnie hosted a farewell dinner for Utkarsh to which the top management executives were invited. Many spoke on the occasion and Ayesha was shocked to see the hypocrisy displayed by Utkarsh’s direct reportees. He had nurtured and helped each of them grow to where they were. And today, every one of them had betrayed him. His chosen six had forsaken him for the temptations of office and money. The irony of the situation incensed her. ‘Christ had to deal with but one Judas!’ she thought. On the day that Utkarsh finally demitted office, Ayesha was amongst the few who walked him to his car. As they shook hands, she said. ‘After all that you have done for them, I feel terrible about the way they behaved.’ Utkarsh understood whom she was referring to. He put a hand on her shoulder and said, ‘I have no complaints against any one, Ayesha. Such things come with the territory. To expect otherwise would be to fool oneself and invite unnecessary hurt.’ She brushed aside her tears and waved him goodbye. She was now EA to Vidur who had moved into Utkarsh’s room. Ayesha always knew Vidur to be an ambitious person. But it’s only after he became the CEO that she witnessed the full extent of his ambitions. While Utkarsh was open to suggestions and shared his knowledge with everyone, Vidur turned out to be quite the opposite. He was close-minded and would feel insecure if his direct reportees met Ronnie when he was not around. Utkarsh had encouraged Ronnie to meet up with their global clients and often accompanied him to such meetings, Vidur always managed to find some excuses not to expose Ronnie to their clients. Oft-stated reasons were that the clients themselves were travelling. The company’s growth and profits in the next two quarters took a substantial dip. The next board meeting in Charlotte was a heated one. The chairman observed that Vidur and Ronnie were at loggerheads and no one knew what was to be done to improve things. The chairman, who was very upset and losing patience with each passing day, asked Ronnie to see him later in his office. The chairman and Ronnie had worked together for over twenty years and this was the first time that Ronnie seemed not in control of his business. They met in the chairman’s office. ‘What’s happening, Ronnie? Am I getting a sense that Vidur is trying to blame you for the debacle in India?’ ‘I did get that feeling in the meeting today. I am shocked at this guy’s audacity,’ said Ronnie. ‘Since the day you asked Utkarsh to leave and made this guy the CEO, things have just gone downhill. Did we read it wrong?’ he asked. ‘At least Utkarsh was open and supportive. This guy is so closed and insecure. Even his erstwhile colleagues are very unhappy and we may soon lose them if nothing is done,’ said Ronnie. ‘Well, India is your baby now. If you want to make any changes, I am with you. Do whatever it takes but please stem the rot immediately or this acquisition is going to make us all, especially me, look very bad,’ said the chairman. In the week following the board meeting, all employees received another email from Ronnie. ‘Vidur is leaving the organization due to personal reasons. Naresh, the global head of sales, will be the new CEO.’ Even that decision did not help. Over the next four quarters, the company continued to make major losses and was soon sold in what was considered a distress sale. Ayesha had seen enough and connected with Utkarsh who had started his own consulting firm with private equity investments. She met him over lunch and apprised him of all that had happened after his departure from the company. He expressed regret on how things had turned out. There was not a grain of bitterness in his voice or malice towards anyone. She could not hold back her feelings. ‘I fail to understand how you can be so forgiving. Serves them right for ganging up against you.’ ‘Ayesha, remember what happens post a merger-and-acquisition in the industry is no different from what happened in the past when one country invaded and occupied another,’ said Utkarsh. Ayesha did not understand. He explained, ‘The elite in the country being invaded often collaborated with the invading force against their own rulers. They were just trying to protect their own interests. What makes you think the corporate world is any different? Vidur and the others were only protecting their own interests. ‘And look at the positive side. You get to observe and learn things that you would never have learnt anywhere else. Okay, let’s leave all that aside. Tell me, when are you joining us?’ Ayesha felt blessed that she would work with him again.",

      "content": "6 Strange Are the Ways of Karma The offer was too good to pass up! I grabbed it with both hands. After all, tell me, how many make it to the CEO position by the age of forty? In a global technology company! Located in Silicon Valley in the US! Many congratulated me; even those who, I knew, were envious of my success. There were also some naysayers who warned me that I had never worked at this level before. ‘Don’t you think you are punching above your weight?’ asked my colleague and a good friend at my workplace in Bangalore. ‘Why do you say that?’ I asked, knowing he only meant well. ‘From your present role as the head of technology to that of a CEO is a whole new ballgame. And that too located in the US. Are you sure you are up to it?’ ‘Guess I am. The only issue I see is for my wife and kids to adjust to the culture there.’ ‘As a CEO, you will be dealing with a lot more ambiguity than ever before. And remember, success at that level is all about your ability to read and manage the politics at the top,’ he cautioned me. I replied with a nervous laugh: ‘As they say, if one has managed senior folk in India, then one can do it anywhere in the world.’ We soon moved to Menlo Park in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. The company, with over fifteen thousand employees and operations in eight countries, was a leading player in IT solutions and services, including systems integration, information systems, IT-enabled services and software development space. Every country head of the company reported to me. Our biggest presence was in India, which had three centres. Bhaskar headed our operations there and was based out of Mumbai. My wife and kids loved the large, independent house with spacious gardens in the front and the back. The company also helped with admissions in a prestigious school and the school bus picked up and dropped the kids right outside our home. Srini, the founder and chairman, threw a welcome dinner for us where we met other senior colleagues and their wives. It was a fine gesture and helped in our smooth transition to the new location. As the CEO, I was primarily responsible for the delivery centres across various geographies. I met up with Srini first and shared my 100-day plan with him, as this would be the ideal way to get to know his expectations from me. ‘All our centres are doing well. It’s India that worries me a bit. You know, we have over eight thousand employees there and we enjoy the best-cost arbitrage. Of late, we have seen many senior level people leave,’ said a concerned Srini. ‘I am planning to visit all our centres over the next three weeks. Shall look into some of these issues when I am in India,’ I said. ‘Last year we lost an outstanding performer to competition. And a key client moved with him. We have to stop this from happening again, Srini said’ ‘I shall spend some time with Bhaskar and am sure we can contain the problem there,’ I assured him. ‘And do spend some time with Tom before you embark on your trip. He has lost two HR heads in India during the last two years. He has a pretty good idea of what’s happening there.’ Tom, the chief people officer at corporate, had really gone out of his way to help with my induction. He had been in the company for over a decade and the two of us had built a good rapport in a short while. He came across as an objective person who never hesitated to speak his mind. We met in his room. ‘Hi, Tom I am planning to travel to our centres over the next few weeks. Srini spoke to me about the high employee attrition in India. Anything I need to know?’ I said. ‘India is quite different from the other geographies in the sense that Bhaskar virtually runs that place. He has only one customer within our company and that is Srini,’ replied Tom. ‘But then he reports into me,’ I said. Tom laughed, ‘Well, you will meet him soon and then you will know.’ This was worrisome. I had to know more. ‘Tell me Tom, how did the previous CEO manage Bhaskar?’ ‘Well, in the initial months he did try to rein him in, but gave up soon,’ said Tom. ‘Are you saying that Bhaskar has a hotline to Srini?’ I asked. ‘Well, it’s an open secret here that Srini is blindsided when it comes to Bhaskar,’ he said. ‘Really?’ I wanted Tom to enlighten me a bit more. ‘Srini and Bhaskar go back a long way. They come from the same town somewhere in south India and are, I believe, related in some distant sort of way.’ Tom then went on to provide some insights on the other centres located in Europe and the Far East. I was keen to know more about Bhaskar but refrained from asking any more probing questions. ‘And one more thing,’ said Tom. ‘While you are there, could you interview a candidate I am considering to head human resources in India? In the last two years we have lost two of them.’ ‘Sure, Tom. Please have your secretary set it up.’ Two weeks later I was with Bhaskar in his office in Mumbai. ‘Welcome to our company. Srini has briefed me about your background,’ said Bhaskar, seizing the initiative. I thanked him and requested him to bring me up to speed on our operations in India. As he spoke, I observed that he was very animated and exuded high energy. Every third sentence was punctuated with a ‘you know what I mean’ and his words came forth as if fired from a machine gun. His flaying hands and his eyes, which seemed to trace the path of an imaginary fly, kept distracting me. I asked him a few pointed questions on the high attrition of senior folk in India. ‘These are all self-serving kind of people. No loyalty. You know what I mean?’ he replied. ‘Surely you would have gathered something from them during the exit interviews?’ I pressed him. ‘Exit interviews are a formality. You know what I mean? Does anyone ever speak the truth during these interviews?’ he countered. ‘I would like to see the personal files of all who have left us in the last one year,’ I said, hoping to let him know who was the boss. ‘I will have my secretary send them to you to the visiting managers’ cabin,’ he replied. So now I was just a visiting manager to him. ‘I would like to meet up with your direct reportee too.’ ‘My secretary will arrange that. Do you want to meet them in the visiting managers’ room or in the boardroom?’ ‘I will meet them, one at a time, in my room,’ I said, laying emphasis on the words ‘my room’. If he caught the emphasis he clearly ignored it and said, ‘Srini spoke to me about you. He told me how the two of you often used to meet at conferences in Silicon Valley and in India and he is very happy that you accepted his offer.’ If this was an arm-wrestling match, Bhaskar was completely on top. He was a master at this; so, I beat a quiet retreat. For the moment. I thanked him and went over to the ‘visiting managers’ room. Over the next three days that I was there, I met up with Bhaskar’s direct reportees and the centre heads from the other two locations in India. It was obvious that they owed complete allegiance to Bhaskar. All of them echoed his sentiments on the reasons why so many senior folk had quit in the past two years. I called up the two HR heads who had quit in the last two years and introduced myself. I requested them to join me for dinner in the hotel where I stayed. I was keen to learn from their insights on their experience with us. I could use some of that when I interviewed the new candidate. To my surprise, they both agreed but requested that we meet at some other hotel. The two of them were very open and spoke without any bitterness or prejudice. I asked them what had provoked them to leave. While their reasons were quite different, there was one common factor: Bhaskar. ‘I understand that Srini and Bhaskar go a long way and are related in some way,’ I said hoping this would be a conversation opener. ‘Yes, they are related but very distant. It is obvious that Bhaskar runs this place exactly as he wants it. He has a set of favourite employees who form his coterie. As the HR head here, I often felt helpless that I was not able stand up for some employees who were being victimised. Even Tom was not able to do anything. I quit and moved on,’ one of them said. The other person informed me that he had to quit when one of the female employees complained of sexual harassment by her function head. Bhaskar chose to look the other way, as the accused person was his blue-eyed boy who managed a very large client. Bhaskar forced the girl to leave and the HR head put in his papers too after he raised the matter with Srini but was politely told to leave it to Bhaskar. In summary, the dinner meeting proved to be very useful. The next day, as the HR candidate’s resume was placed before me, I realized that he had worked with me a few years ago. As he entered my room, I walked over and shook hands, ‘Hi, Anubhav. What a pleasant surprise! I am so happy to see you here.’ ‘Same here. I was told I would be meeting the CEO, but would never have guessed I would be meeting you,’ he said. The interview was a mere formality. In fact, I did most of the talking. I called Tom that evening and informed him that he had the perfect candidate in Anubhav and apprised him of our having worked together. I had a couple of more meetings with Bhaskar and then flew off to the US. The company continued to do well. Bhaskar and I tried to get along. I made my suggestions and he did exactly what he wanted to do. I tried to seek Srini’s intervention but it was pointless. Bhaskar could do no wrong. We continued to lose senior folk in India and Bhaskar’s views always prevailed. ‘They are all cultural misfits. You know what I mean!’ was his refrain. Anubhav and I spoke regularly about this and he often shared details of Bhaskar’s misdeeds. I tried bringing some of those to Srini’s notice but to no avail. I decided to let things be and focus on other centres. I had to admit that I had failed in managing these dynamics at the top. Did I take on the CEO role ahead of my time? Things went on smoothly for a year or so, till that morning when Anubhav called to tell me he had decided to quit. ‘Is it not late in India at this time, Anubhav?’ I asked. ‘Yes, it is. I had to speak with my wife and we have decided that this is the best course of action for me,’ he said. ‘What happened?’ ‘Nothing new. It’s Bhaskar again. You know that we have no analytics practice in our company. He managed to interest a potential client looking to outsource a large part of the analytics work. It could have been a multi-million-dollar opportunity. So, we hired a very senior lady from a large company here to help build the analytics team in order to showcase the same to the potential client when they would visit us next month. She joined us last week and brought along three of her team members. This morning we were informed that the client would not be coming to India this year. Bhaskar just got me to fire the lady and her team this evening. I cannot take this anymore,’ said Anubhav. ‘I know how you feel, Anubhav. Surely, we will look at what you are saying and do something about it,’ I said. ‘You know what is happening. Bhaskar’s unethical behaviour is destroying this place. Earlier there were only whispers, but now everyone is openly talking about it. And the fact that corporate is allowing these things to continue, has completely destroyed the morale out here.’ I knew Anubhav had made up his mind. Had I been in his place, I would have done the same. I realized that amidst this cloud there existed a silver lining. I would use it to my advantage to put Bhaskar in his place. ‘I have to go into a meeting now. Why don’t I have a detailed talk with you later in the evening, our time. Should be tomorrow morning for you. Let me set up a bridge and send you the details,’ I said. ‘Okay, I shall take the call from home.’ I set up the bridge and sought some time with Srini. ‘Our HR head in India has just quit. This is the third one to go in three years,’ I informed him. ‘Did he give any reasons?’ asked Srini. ‘He is very unhappy with some of Bhaskar’s unethical behaviour. You know the other HR heads too had similar problems,’ I said hoping he would at least listen now. ‘It’s all hearsay. I think it is not fair to make such allegations unless we have some hard, irrefutable facts.’ ‘I have set up a bridge for a call with Anubhav this evening. I would request you to just silently listen in. He doesn’t know you would be there,’ I said hoping that at least this would open Srini’s eyes. I called in at 7 p.m. that evening and waited. Anubhav joined the call. At one level I felt uncomfortable that I had not informed him about Srini listening in. I consoled myself thinking that the end justified the means. After exchanging initial pleasantries, I went about the task of making him narrate how things were out there. ‘Yes, you were saying when we last spoke, that the situation in India is turning from bad to worse. The kind of unethical things happening there has started causing low morale everywhere and that more senior folk will soon quit. Could you elaborate on that?’ I said, wanting to draw him out to name Bhaskar. He sounded less agitated and spoke with a calm voice. ‘I think there is a disconnect in the way we set expectations when employees join us. I don’t think most of the people who join us are used to the pace of work out here. You know we rightly push everyone to achieve greater heights but these folk are not used to this. Many who are not able to match up in our performance-driven culture just find reasons to quit and make allegations against the senior folk here.’ I was shocked and completely lost for words. Things were moving quite in the opposite direction and this call would make me look bad in Srini’s eyes. I attempted to retrieve the situation but nothing worked. Anubhav continued to praise our culture. Realizing that I was not getting anywhere, I thanked him for his time and got off the call. Two minutes later, I called him on his mobile phone. ‘Anubhav, what was all that about? What happened? What you said on the call was completely different from what you had said last night. What happened between then and now? Why all this sudden fondness for our culture?’ I demanded an answer. It was then that he dropped his first bomb: ‘Well you never told me you had invited Srini to listen in on the call.’ And before I could answer, he dropped the second bomb. Much bigger than the first one. ‘And did you know that Srini had invited Bhaskar to also quietly listen in?’ he said and waited for an answer. ‘I am sorry, Anubhav. I did ask Srini to listen in. He just refuses to see the truth and I thought this was the only way. I apologize for not telling you. But how do you know that Srini asked Bhaskar to also listen in?’ ‘Well, this morning, half an hour before the call, Bhaskar called me and said he was aware of our call. He then told me that you had invited Srini to silently listen in. And then what he said took my breath away. He said that Srini had sent him the bridge details and asked him to listen in and that no one knows about this but me.’ Bhaskar had outsmarted me again. And before I could say anything, Anubhav said it all for me. ‘I don’t blame you for what happened. In fact, I am glad this happened. It has only vindicated my decision to leave this messed up place. And I seriously wonder how you can continue to work here.’ He was so right!",

She did her undergraduate programme in economics from Cambridge University, and her master’s in financial engineering from a prestigious college in the US. She then joined Barclays Bank at their corporate office at Canary Wharf, London. After two years with them, she applied and made it to the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford, from where she graduated at the top of her class in 2005. The Boston Consulting Group picked her from campus and she was one of the star performers. She spent six years with them in the UK before moving to India to be with her old parents in Mumbai. Nidhi soon joined another leading consulting firm in Mumbai and here too she was consistently rated as a best performer and promoted twice in four years. At an industry meet at the Taj Mahal Hotel, during lunch, she happened to be seated next to the CEO of the Indian subsidiary of a large US bank. Her educational background, her experience at Barclays and in the consulting firms particularly impressed him. They exchanged cards and a week later he called her. ‘Hi, Nidhi remember me? We met at the Taj over lunch last week during the seminar on global leadership practices.’ ‘Of course, I remember,’ she said. ‘Oh, that’s nice. Let me come straight to the point. After ten years of continuous growth, there has been a slight blip in our bank’s performance this year. Our corporate office in the US has suggested we engage one of the big four consulting firms and evolve a strategic roadmap for the future.’ ‘That’s a great idea. I would also suggest that such an exercise must be refreshed every three years or so. Going forward, you could do this either with your internal resources or engage an external consultant,’ said Nidhi. ‘Exactly what I had in mind. I am actually looking to hire someone who can drive such an initiative and build a strategic team here. And in my opinion, someone like you is the best person to do this,’ said the CEO. ‘Well, I am flattered,’ said Nidhi. ‘I mean it,’ said the CEO. ‘This is a leadership position and would have visibility right into our corporate office in the US.’ ‘Sounds interesting! I would like to know more,’ said Nidhi. They met the following week where the CEO elaborated on the role. The compensation was much higher than her current one and she would be the head of strategy, reporting to the CEO. ‘So, what are the next steps?’ she asked. ‘My leadership team, of which you would be a member, now comprises our COO, CFO, heads of consumer and commercial banking and the chief human resources officer (CHRO). I would like them to meet you too. As far as I am concerned, these meetings are more of a formality but I believe that this would help foster greater team spirit,’ said the CEO. ‘I think that’s a great idea. I would appreciate if this can be done in a short time so that I can put in my papers with my current employers,’ said Nidhi. ‘Sure. I will introduce you to our CHRO and then have him co-ordinate meetings with the others.’ The CHRO seemed to be a pleasant person and quite supportive. Besides helping her understand the organization, its history and culture, he also shared his insights on the other leadership team members. ‘The CFO and I joined around four years ago. We are not from the industry. The COO and the heads of consumer and commercial banking are from the banking industry and have been here for seven years. In fact, the three of them worked at the same bank prior to coming here,’ said the CHRO. ‘So, is there anything I need to watch out for?’ asked Nidhi. ‘Not really. They are all professionals. But yes, they are close-knit and do influence each other a lot.’ ‘Thank you for letting me know. I guess if I know my work and do things diligently here, everything should be okay.’ The CHRO gave her a smile. The meetings with the others went on well and in a month’s time Nidhi joined the bank. Within a week of her joining, the CEO called for a meeting of the leadership team. ‘Now that Nidhi is with us, our first priority is to initiate the strategy planning exercise. Our chairman would be personally tracking this and we need to make things happen soon.’ The COO spoke first: ‘My friend heads of one of the big Four consulting firms here. I suggest we just call him and hand over the assignment right away to them.’ The heads of consumer and commercial banking seconded his views. The CEO looked at Nidhi: ‘Let’s hear what Nidhi has to say.’ She addressed the COO: ‘While that would certainly speed up things, it may not necessarily get us the best deal. Let’s invite all the Big Four to pitch for our business. This way, we not only get to see a variety of approaches but we can also negotiate the best fees.’ The COO, who considered himself more equal than the others in the leadership team, was clearly not happy. ‘I have already spoken with my friend and they are very keen to work with us,’ he said. The CEO looked around the table. None of the others ventured any suggestions and he was not surprised. ‘I feel the easiest thing to do would be to give this assignment to the firm where Nidhi worked prior to joining us. They know her and things would move pretty fast. I appreciate that Nidhi did not suggest that,’ said the CEO. The COO responded, ‘Well, I only made that suggestion as time is of essence. If Nidhi can fast forward the whole process of shortlisting a firm, I have no problem.’ And so it was decided. Nidhi got to work immediately. She prepared the pitch brief and circulated the same amongst her colleagues seeking their comments. When the CEO saw the document, he felt vindicated on his decision to hire Nidhi. The document was comprehensive and clearly articulated the expectations from the consulting firms and laid down the evaluation criteria on the basis of which the final shortlist would be made. The CEO immediately sent back the documents commending Nidhi on her attention to detail. He made no suggestions and was certain that none of the others would be able to add value to Nidhi’s work. He was right. The CFO and CHRO too returned the document without any comments. Nidhi had to follow up thrice over the next ten days before she received the documents from the COO and the heads of consumer and commercial banking. They did not make any comments. The four firms were invited and briefed by Nidhi and given four weeks to respond with their presentations. The dates for presentations by the consulting firms had to be postponed thrice. Sometimes the COO had urgent client meetings and at other times, either of the two heads of consumer and commercial banking had last-minute crisis situations to deal with. For the first time in her career Nidhi felt exasperated and helpless. She sought the CHRO’s counsel. ‘Are these guys like this always or is it something to do with me?’ she asked the CHRO. ‘I don’t think it is anything to do with you. I just feel that if you had let the COO have his way in engaging his friend’s firm, you would have found things a bit different,’ said the CHRO. ‘Should I speak to the CEO and seek his intervention?’ ‘I don’t think that will help much. In the four years that I have been here, I have not seen the CEO ever confront the COO.’ ‘But he supported me in my suggestion on the shortlisting process.’ ‘Well, he did not really confront the COO. He only made a suggestion to support you as you were the new kid on the block.’ ‘So, what do you suggest I do?’ ‘Play up to the COO and his ego. Remember he knows that he cannot delay things beyond a point. All he is trying to do is makes things a bit difficult for you. Once he co-operates, the other two will soon fall in line.’ ‘But why pick on me? I am not competing with him.’ ‘I agree that under normal circumstances he would never see you as competition. But remember it was our chairman in the US who initiated this assignment. Everyone wants their share of visibility where the chairman is concerned. In my long career in human resources I find that it’s the senior folk who are the most insecure and crave more for such visibility.’ Nidhi had never thought of things this way. She had believed that if one was competent and performed one’s work with sincerity then that was all that mattered. She was now learning new aspects of human behaviour and interpersonal dynamics that were crucial to being successful. Nidhi followed the CHRO’s advice and new dates were set for presentations by the four contenders. Fortunately, this time, there were no postponements. One firm was finally shortlisted, but not the one suggested by the COO. At the same time, Nidhi was silently grateful that her previous employers were also not the ones finally selected. Things soon moved at a quick pace. The selected firm sent in their best consultant to work on the assignment. Nidhi was the single point of contact within the bank. It was decided that the concerned consultant would spend the first two weeks speaking with the top three layers within the bank’s hierarchy and to a few clients to map out current issues. He would then make an interim presentation to the leadership team and seek their inputs. Thereafter, the consultant would put together a suggested roadmap with clear, actionable steps. A date was also set for the final presentation in which the chairman would connect via a video-conference call. Every evening, Nidhi met the consultant and sought an update. Most meetings were going as per plan. The COO and the two heads of consumer and commercial banking were the only ones not able to spare sufficient time. Nidhi made sure that he CEO gave more of his time to make up for this. The consultant made his interim presentation on the scheduled date and received inputs from the leadership team. As planned, he then went back to his firm to work with others there and to prepare his final presentations. The next day, the CEO called for a meeting of the leadership team. ‘I think some of us are not too enthused with this exercise. I expected some more suggestions yesterday when the consultant presented his interim report,’ said the CEO. ‘If you want my honest opinion then I think the firm should have sent us someone more competent. Maybe we should ask them to change the person,’ said the COO. Two others in the room seemed to agree with him. Nidhi was tempted to ask him how he could arrive at this conclusion when he had hardly given the consultant sufficient time. But she held her peace and said instead, ‘In all my years in consulting, I have never come across nor heard of a situation where a client seeks a mid-course change of consultant. No firm will allow this. It will severely damage their reputation and diminish employee morale. I suggest we wait for the final recommendations that will be made with inputs from other senior people in the firm.’ The CEO agreed to this suggestion. Two weeks later, the day of reckoning arrived. The CEO and his leadership team were seated in the boardroom. The head of the consulting firm was also present. They were waiting for the chairman to call-in before the consultant would start his presentation. Soon, they were all set to go. The quality of the presentation was quite slick. The slides were well-designed and simple to comprehend. Some people in the room and the chairman often interjected during the presentation and Nidhi was happy to see the consultant answer with confidence and clarity. And then, she suddenly realized something that made her very nervous. The COO and the two heads of consumer and commercial banking, who were seated in a corner of the room, had not asked any questions. In fact, they were looking into their laptops most of the time and seemed to ignore the presentation altogether. She quickly scribbled something on a sticky note, got up, and excused herself for a few minutes, went around to the place where the COO and the other two were seated and walked over to the presenter and handed him the paper and said, ‘I have to make an urgent personal call. My new number is written here. Please call me in case you need me.’ When she returned a few minutes later, she noticed that all the three laptops had been closed and everyone was paying close attention. The presentation soon ended with some clear recommendations. The chairman sought views from the people present. The COO spoke first: ‘I think it was an excellent presentation and we must start implementation of the recommendations right away. I would, in fact, request the head of the consulting firm here to spare the services of this consultant for a few months more to help in the implementation.’ The other two immediately seconded this suggestion. The chairman too seemed happy and asked the CEO to work out the next steps. As everyone left the room, the CEO asked Nidhi to come over to his office. ‘Good show, Nidhi. But tell me, what did you write in that sticky note. Not your phone number I am sure?’ ‘Oh, that!’ smiled Nidhi. ‘During the meeting, when I saw the COO and the other two were quite indifferent to the presentation and busy with their laptops, it suddenly struck me that throughout the presentation the consultant only acknowledged inputs from you and me and failed to give credit to anyone else. I was worried that the COO and the other two may later shoot down all recommendations, and getting their buy-in was critical.’ ‘So, what was in that slip of paper?’ ‘I asked the consultant to stop quoting you and me and to just acknowledge the COO and the other two for everything,’ said Nidhi. The CEO looked at her with newfound pride!",

She did her undergraduate programme in economics from Cambridge University, and her master’s in financial engineering from a prestigious college in the US. She then joined Barclays Bank at their corporate office at Canary Wharf, London. After two years with them, she applied and made it to the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford, from where she graduated at the top of her class in 2005. The Boston Consulting Group picked her from campus and she was one of the star performers. She spent six years with them in the UK before moving to India to be with her old parents in Mumbai.

      "content": "8 Come Walk a Mile in My Shoes The 1980s witnessed a major inflection point in India’s automobile industry. Maruti Suzuki led the charge followed by the introduction of 100 cc Japanese motorcycles. The truck industry too saw licences being issued for the manufacture of Light Commercial Vehicles. Majority of these involved collaborations with Japanese automakers and it was only natural that the new entrants would look to attract talent from existing reputed truck manufacturer. There was no dearth of talent in retail sales. The situation was quite different when it came to hiring people to manage institutional sales where the number of experienced people was very low. So, it was no surprise that Divij, a well-respected auto industry professional, with a reputation of having successfully established the institutional sales function at two of India’s well-established truck brands, was sought by most of the new entrant companies. Following a period of protracted discussions with his prospective employers, Divij finally agreed to join one of these new players. Two factors influenced his decision – the opportunity to be exposed to world-class Japanese practices and a free hand to set up and grow the institutional sales function. He had made it clear to the CEO, who was from the car industry but with a background in retail selling: ‘Selling to institutions involves much longer sales cycles and the government departments, among our biggest customers, have their own well-set procurement processes. We need to have the patience to set realistic targets in this space.’ Divij joined as vice president and spent the next six months putting his team in place. Next, he met up with his existing network of customers to apprise them of his new position and the new offerings. The CEO seemed pleased with the progress in building the institutional sales function and said so during the sales review meeting. ‘Looks like everything is on track, Divij?’ ‘Yes, we have met all our milestones,’ said Divij. ‘Great. So, can I budget some number for your team?’ asked the CEO. ‘Give us another three months and we will take that on. Given the long duration involved in institutional sales, I suggest we set six-month targets,’ said Divij. ‘Sure,’ said the CEO and then made a surprise announcement. ‘I am moving on, and a new CEO has been identified.’ They had heard rumours, even so, it came as a shock. ‘What happened? This is going to impact us all in a big way,’ said the retail sales head. ‘I believe no one is indispensable. I don’t mean it as a cliché, but we have a great team here and we have made the transition to being process-driven from the early days when we were mainly people-driven. I am sure things will continue as they are, irrespective of who heads the company,’ said the CEO. Events moved fast. Arjun, the new CEO joined in a month’s time. Life continued for everyone except Divij. Unlike the earlier CEO, Arjun was more focused on immediate goals and expected the institutional sales team to carry monthly targets like the retail sales teams. He had no clue of the issues involved in this area and was not willing to listen to what Divij had to say. From then on, every monthly sales review meeting turned out to be nothing short of an inquisition for Divij – a period of prolonged and intensive questioning by Arjun as to why he was not meeting his targets. As Divij walked into the boardroom for one such review meeting, he said hello to the retail sales head and the other four regional sales heads already present there. Were those sympathetic looks or was it his imagination? Before he could find an answer, the door opened and Arjun breezed in, late for the first time. ‘Sorry I am late. The chairman summoned me. He is very upset that we have not met our targets.’ The retail sales head and regional heads made their presentations in quick succession. One of them had fallen short in meeting his targets. Arjun patiently listened and then offered some suggestions. He then turned to Divij: ‘Do you have some good news this time?’ ‘I was hoping that the state transport department would close that large order last month,’ said Divij. ‘This is the third consecutive quarter you have slipped up.’ ‘But Arjun, you know institutional sales are never predictable,’ said Divij. ‘Then how do our competitors always do better?’ shot back Arjun. ‘If we do not meet our targets this year, somebody will be looking for a job. And it won’t be me.’ Later that evening, as Divij sat in his office, he realized that, for the first time in his career, he would be a failure. Why could Arjun not realize that selling cycle for institutional sales was never the same as normal sales? There was nothing more frustrating than working with a boss who had no clue where your shoe pinched. The loud ringing of the phone on his table interrupted his thoughts. ‘Hi, Divij thought I would just call and say hello.’ It was his former boss. Sometimes coincidences can turn out to be providential. ‘Nice to hear from you! How are you doing?’ enquired Divij. ‘I am doing fine. You tell me, how are you doing?’ ‘Okay,’ said Divij. ‘Just came out of a sales review. No one here understands anything about institutional selling.’ ‘What happened?’ ‘My new boss expects me to meet month-on-month targets. He is quite considerate while dealing with the regional sales heads. But when it comes to institutional sales, he has zero patience. I feel humiliated at times,’ said Divij. He then went on to apprise his former boss of how the state transport department kept delaying its procurement decisions and how he was being blamed for it. ‘Divij, I don’t think your boss has ever handled institutional sales. The only way to make him appreciate your constraints is to make him empathize with you.’ ‘How do I do that? He is just not willing to listen to reason,’ said Divij. ‘I understand, Divij. Just make him walk some distance in your shoes. Believe me, he will then appreciate your constraints.’ ‘What exactly do you mean?’ asked Divij. ‘Why don’t you take him to your next meeting with the state transport department? Let him see how those guys work and the challenges you have to face.’ ‘How can I do that? You know how unpredictable and discourteous those guys are. They cancel meetings at the last minute. And there is not even a decent waiting place out there.’ ‘That is exactly my point. Let your boss experience what you go through and things will be much better. Trust me.’ Divij was quiet for a few seconds. ‘Okay, let me give it a shot. Thanks for your call. I feel much better now,’ said Divij As advised, Divij convinced Arjun that his presence was crucial at the next meeting with the transport department where a final decision was likely to be taken. ‘If the meeting with the transport secretary is scheduled for 10 a.m., why are we here at 9.15?’ asked Arjun, as the security staff stopped their car outside the government building. ‘We have to get down here and walk. It will take some time to have our entry passes made,’ said Divij, as he stepped out and waited for Arjun. They walked 100 metres towards the place where passes were issued. The long queue spilled out of the small room onto the road and the two of them looked quite overdressed in their suits and ties on that summer morning. It took thirty minutes for them to receive their passes and another walk of over fifty metres around the building to the waiting room. As they walked in, they found every chair and bench in the stuffy room already occupied by contractors and transporters. An antiquated ceiling fan struggled to keep the air circulating. Divij tried to make some space on one of the benches for Arjun, who preferred to remain standing. The hours passed. An assistant would periodically enter the room and ask a particular visitor to follow him. ‘Were we not supposed to see the transport secretary at 10 a.m.?’ asked an impatient Arjun. ‘That’s what I was told. I have informed his assistant that we are here. Now we wait to be called,’ said Divij. Another three hours passed before the assistant appeared to announce lunch break. ‘Sir will come back at 2 p.m.,’ he said, and walked away. Some snacks were available in a few run-down shacks set up along the pavements outside and away from the main gates. Divij took Arjun there. ‘You expect me to eat here? Don’t they have a canteen?’ Arjun asked. ‘They do, but only government employees eat there.’ ‘Why don’t we drive down to the market nearby and grab a quick bite?’ suggested Arjun. Divij advised against it as he was keen to get back before 2 p.m. They managed to share a soggy sandwich and get back to the waiting area. Around 3.30 p.m., the assistant ushered them into the transport secretary’s office. Arjun offered his business card, which the official did not so much as glance at. They remained standing while the official addressed Divij, ‘I don’t understand why you keep following up. I have told you that once we take a decision we will let you know. Your competitors have offered us eight per cent discount. I hope you understand what I am saying. Come back only if you can better that.’ Before either Divij or Arjun could say a word, he hit the button on the brass bell on his table. ‘Next!’ The same assistant showed them out. Neither of them spoke on their way back to office. Divij felt guilty for subjecting Arjun to this treatment and was worried about the repercussions. At the subsequent sales review meeting, Divij was pleasantly surprised to find Arjun very considerate towards him. ‘I know we weren’t able to make any headway on that order. That guy was asking for an unreasonable discount, which the chairman has clearly not approved. And Divij, the next time you go to such offices, you must carry some food from home. That was quite an experience!’ said Arjun. A part of Divij’s targets, that year, was allocated to other regional managers and the company met its sales targets.",

      "content": "8 Come Walk a Mile in My Shoes The 1980s witnessed a major inflection point in India’s automobile industry. Maruti Suzuki led the charge followed by the introduction of 100 cc Japanese motorcycles. The truck industry too saw licences being issued for the manufacture of Light Commercial Vehicles. Majority of these involved collaborations with Japanese automakers and it was only natural that the new entrants would look to attract talent from existing reputed truck manufacturer. There was no dearth of talent in retail sales. The situation was quite different when it came to hiring people to manage institutional sales where the number of experienced people was very low. So, it was no surprise that Divij, a well-respected auto industry professional, with a reputation of having successfully established the institutional sales function at two of India’s well-established truck brands, was sought by most of the new entrant companies. Following a period of protracted discussions with his prospective employers, Divij finally agreed to join one of these new players. Two factors influenced his decision – the opportunity to be exposed to world-class Japanese practices and a free hand to set up and grow the institutional sales function. He had made it clear to the CEO, who was from the car industry but with a background in retail selling: ‘Selling to institutions involves much longer sales cycles and the government departments, among our biggest customers, have their own well-set procurement processes. We need to have the patience to set realistic targets in this space.’ Divij joined as vice president and spent the next six months putting his team in place. Next, he met up with his existing network of customers to apprise them of his new position and the new offerings. The CEO seemed pleased with the progress in building the institutional sales function and said so during the sales review meeting. ‘Looks like everything is on track, Divij?’ ‘Yes, we have met all our milestones,’ said Divij. ‘Great. So, can I budget some number for your team?’ asked the CEO. ‘Give us another three months and we will take that on. Given the long duration involved in institutional sales, I suggest we set six-month targets,’ said Divij. ‘Sure,’ said the CEO and then made a surprise announcement. ‘I am moving on, and a new CEO has been identified.’ They had heard rumours, even so, it came as a shock. ‘What happened? This is going to impact us all in a big way,’ said the retail sales head. ‘I believe no one is indispensable. I don’t mean it as a cliché, but we have a great team here and we have made the transition to being process-driven from the early days when we were mainly people-driven. I am sure things will continue as they are, irrespective of who heads the company,’ said the CEO. Events moved fast. Arjun, the new CEO joined in a month’s time. Life continued for everyone except Divij. Unlike the earlier CEO, Arjun was more focused on immediate goals and expected the institutional sales team to carry monthly targets like the retail sales teams. He had no clue of the issues involved in this area and was not willing to listen to what Divij had to say. From then on, every monthly sales review meeting turned out to be nothing short of an inquisition for Divij – a period of prolonged and intensive questioning by Arjun as to why he was not meeting his targets. As Divij walked into the boardroom for one such review meeting, he said hello to the retail sales head and the other four regional sales heads already present there. Were those sympathetic looks or was it his imagination? Before he could find an answer, the door opened and Arjun breezed in, late for the first time. ‘Sorry I am late. The chairman summoned me. He is very upset that we have not met our targets.’ The retail sales head and regional heads made their presentations in quick succession. One of them had fallen short in meeting his targets. Arjun patiently listened and then offered some suggestions. He then turned to Divij: ‘Do you have some good news this time?’ ‘I was hoping that the state transport department would close that large order last month,’ said Divij. ‘This is the third consecutive quarter you have slipped up.’ ‘But Arjun, you know institutional sales are never predictable,’ said Divij. ‘Then how do our competitors always do better?’ shot back Arjun. ‘If we do not meet our targets this year, somebody will be looking for a job. And it won’t be me.’ Later that evening, as Divij sat in his office, he realized that, for the first time in his career, he would be a failure. Why could Arjun not realize that selling cycle for institutional sales was never the same as normal sales? There was nothing more frustrating than working with a boss who had no clue where your shoe pinched. The loud ringing of the phone on his table interrupted his thoughts. ‘Hi, Divij thought I would just call and say hello.’ It was his former boss. Sometimes coincidences can turn out to be providential. ‘Nice to hear from you! How are you doing?’ enquired Divij. ‘I am doing fine. You tell me, how are you doing?’ ‘Okay,’ said Divij. ‘Just came out of a sales review. No one here understands anything about institutional selling.’ ‘What happened?’ ‘My new boss expects me to meet month-on-month targets. He is quite considerate while dealing with the regional sales heads. But when it comes to institutional sales, he has zero patience. I feel humiliated at times,’ said Divij. He then went on to apprise his former boss of how the state transport department kept delaying its procurement decisions and how he was being blamed for it. ‘Divij, I don’t think your boss has ever handled institutional sales. The only way to make him appreciate your constraints is to make him empathize with you.’ ‘How do I do that? He is just not willing to listen to reason,’ said Divij. ‘I understand, Divij. Just make him walk some distance in your shoes. Believe me, he will then appreciate your constraints.’ ‘What exactly do you mean?’ asked Divij. ‘Why don’t you take him to your next meeting with the state transport department? Let him see how those guys work and the challenges you have to face.’ ‘How can I do that? You know how unpredictable and discourteous those guys are. They cancel meetings at the last minute. And there is not even a decent waiting place out there.’ ‘That is exactly my point. Let your boss experience what you go through and things will be much better. Trust me.’ Divij was quiet for a few seconds. ‘Okay, let me give it a shot. Thanks for your call. I feel much better now,’ said Divij As advised, Divij convinced Arjun that his presence was crucial at the next meeting with the transport department where a final decision was likely to be taken. ‘If the meeting with the transport secretary is scheduled for 10 a.m., why are we here at 9.15?’ asked Arjun, as the security staff stopped their car outside the government building. ‘We have to get down here and walk. It will take some time to have our entry passes made,’ said Divij, as he stepped out and waited for Arjun. They walked 100 metres towards the place where passes were issued. The long queue spilled out of the small room onto the road and the two of them looked quite overdressed in their suits and ties on that summer morning. It took thirty minutes for them to receive their passes and another walk of over fifty metres around the building to the waiting room. As they walked in, they found every chair and bench in the stuffy room already occupied by contractors and transporters. An antiquated ceiling fan struggled to keep the air circulating. Divij tried to make some space on one of the benches for Arjun, who preferred to remain standing. The hours passed. An assistant would periodically enter the room and ask a particular visitor to follow him. ‘Were we not supposed to see the transport secretary at 10 a.m.?’ asked an impatient Arjun. ‘That’s what I was told.

      "content": "9 The Door Closer The chairman rose slowly from his chair and leaned forward, towering over Nath, the short, rotund CEO seated across him. And as he stood there with fists closed tight and pressed against his mahogany desk top, he resembled a sumo wrestler about to attack. ‘I don’t care how you manage it, Nath, but I will not tolerate another strike or blackmail by that union leader at our complex in Bhopal,’ he hissed. ‘I will sort this out the moment I am back in Bhopal,’ said Nath. ‘This time you better keep your word. You made a similar promise three years ago and you know what happened. That nasty little union guy of yours, what’s his name … Debu … yes, that’s right, Debu. He called for that strike which lasted a full forty-two days. We lost a lot of money then.’ He continued in a raised voice: ‘And did you not tell me he had been taken care of then? Why are we now again expecting more trouble from him? You know we are right now in the midst of merger talks with one of the world’s largest chemicals companies and I don’t want anything or anyone to derail this.’ Nath made a feeble attempt to again assure his boss but was cut short. ‘You tell me he has aspirations to create a federation of unions across all our factories in India. That will be a disaster, I warn you. You must clip his wings as soon as possible.’ It’s not a pleasant sight to witness your boss, a powerful CEO in his own right, being hauled over the coals in your presence. I was aware that my presence in the room would make him uncomfortable and that I had to somehow assure him that nobody beyond the three of us would ever be privy to what transpired in that room that day. I had to do that quickly, but I had absolutely no idea how to do it. So I did the next best thing – I tried to make myself as invisible as possible. The chairman closed the meeting with a few placatory words, ‘I know you will not allow matters to go out of hand this time, Nath. Best wishes.’ As we exited his cabin through his EA’s room, there were three or four people there, waiting to see the chairman. How much had they heard? Since our flight to Bhopal was a good five hours away, Nath suggested, ‘Let’s stop by at one of the hotels at the aero city near the airport. I could do with a drink.’ ‘Good idea, sir,’ I said. We chose a corner table and ordered our drinks. ‘I saw you getting uncomfortable when the chairman lost his temper. For a moment, I thought you might leave the room,’ he said. ‘You are right, sir. I was very uncomfortable and wanted to step out. Then I realized that if I had opened the door, those waiting outside would hear the chairman. Those hydraulic door closers take their own sweet time in shutting the door completely.’ ‘I guess you’re right. And when people hear snippets of a conversation, without knowing the context fully, it gives rise to all kinds of rumours,’ he said. ‘By the way, I hope what happened in the chairman’s room remains there.’ I was tempted to respond with ‘What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas’. However, knowing he would not appreciate any sign of familiarity from my side, I quickly said, ‘Sure, sir. Please rest assured.’ I had joined Nath a year ago as vice president in his office. During this period, I had learnt many things about him, mostly through the old timers, who shared some stories about him. I learnt that he worked harder than everyone else at this huge, 800-acre fertilizers and chemicals complex, with its ten manufacturing plants, near Bhopal. He had his system of informers and loyalists and there was nothing he was not privy to. It was rumoured that even the trees within the campus stopped rustling if he was in station. ‘What’s your reading of Debu?’ he asked me. ‘I have just met him once or twice, sir. I think he is very intelligent and very convincing when he speaks. He is very ambitious and will stop at nothing. The other workers are aware that he has easy access to you. I also hear that every time he meets you, he gives them the impression that he’s always got the better of you,’ I said. ‘What do you think motivates him to be so disruptive on occasions?’ There was nothing that Nath did not know about Debu, but since he had asked me a question I had to answer and appear knowledgeable. ‘I heard that he was a brilliant student during his school days in Jamshedpur and was keen to pursue engineering. His father, who worked in a factory, was unable to help him pursue his dreams. He sent him to an industrial training institute located close by,’ I said. Nath filled in the rest, ‘I am also told that Debu believes that life is never fair and that one has to constantly fight for one’s rights. Now you know why I let him have his ego trips when he tells the others that he has had the better of me.’ It was time to leave for the airport. On the flight, my thoughts were about Debu. He had joined the company many years before me, as an apprentice in our captive power plant. A diligent worker with a sharp intellect, he seemed to have good influence over his co-workers and was soon elected president of the power plant workers’ union. Three years ago, he had rallied all the plant unions at the Bhopal complex in an attempt to form a single union. The management did not agree to this and Debu engineered a strike at the power plant, which effectively shut down the whole complex. The strike lasted forty-two days, causing immense financial loss to the company. After days of protracted negotiations, the management seemed to give in to most of Debu’s demands and he emerged as the president of the new combined association of unions. It was rumoured that Debu had also managed a few concessions for himself, but no one had any real evidence of this. As most of the negotiations had been carried out between Nath and Debu, the general perception was that Debu had won and Nath had lost. The next triennial agreement was coming up in six months and it was only natural for workers to expect bigger wage increases. Debu, meanwhile, had trained his sights on forming a federation of unions of all the group factories in India. This was what the chairman was alluding to. As the plane began its descent, I was curious to see how Nath would handle the situation. I did not have to wait long. Nath’s secretary informed me that the boss desired to see me the next morning at 7.30 a.m. Access to Nath’s office was through the secretary’s room, which, when I entered at the appointed time, was crowded. Debu was sitting on a two-seater sofa in the corner. Also present in the room were eight personal assistants of every plant manager in the complex. I peered through the small glass window on Nath’s door. He was on the phone. His secretary’s intercom soon buzzed, summoning me. I knocked on Nath’s door and entered. He was still on the phone and gestured for me to take the seat across the table. ‘Is Debu here?’ he asked me. ‘Yes, he is here.’ He buzzed for Debu and what happened next took me by complete surprise. The moment the door was pushed open by Debu, Nath addressed him in raised tones. ‘Who do you think you are, Debu? You drop my name everywhere and spread rumours. Don’t ever forget that you work for me. And if you do not behave yourself, we shall cancel that cement dealership given to your brother in Jamshedpur.’ Debu seemed shell-shocked. I could see his face darken with anger and I expected him to walk out any moment. I was hoping the door behind him would close faster. By then, every word uttered by Nath would have been heard by everyone in the other room. Once the door was fully closed, Nath’s voice softened. ‘Please sit down.’ He then picked up the intercom and spoke to his secretary, ‘Please inform all the others waiting there that I shall see them tomorrow.’ He then turned to Debu who remained standing and looked furious. ‘I don’t understand. Why did you shout at me like that, sir?’ he demanded. ‘Please sit down first. I am sorry, there are too many things bothering me today. By the way, tell me how is everything?’ Debu seemed to relax a bit and sat down. I remained a mere spectator while the two of them discussed what seemed to be mere trivialities, ranging from how his family was doing in Bengal to local politics. Tea and biscuits were served, helping prolong the discussion further. Forty-five minutes later, a smiling Debu shook hands and left the room. As I rose to leave, Nath said, ‘Keep your ear to the ground and let me know what you hear.’ When I left his room, I felt the door took more than its usual time to fully close behind me. Or was I imagining it? The phone on my desk started ringing even before I could sit down. ‘You were there with Nath this morning. What happened with Debu?’ It was the fertilizer plant manager. ‘Nothing much really. They just had a pleasant chat,’ I said. ‘Then why has the union called for a special meeting?’ ‘I’m not aware of that. Please excuse me as I have some urgent reports to submit right now. I will call you soon,’ I said and put the phone down. I then called up some colleagues working at the other plants in the complex. They confirmed the news about the union calling for an urgent meeting. A week later, Debu stepped down as president of the union. And the new president was a more grounded person and had no aspirations to form a federation of all our unions. Nath called me into his room the next day. ‘Finally, this whole unpleasant matter seems to have been resolved. And, to some extent, you helped me resolve this. Thank you,’ he said with a smile. As I left his room, I noticed that the door took more than its usual time to fully shut. A simple hydraulic door closer had provided closure to a long-festering problem.",

      "content": "10 Policy or People? The caller ID on his mobile showed ‘Tat Savitur’. Of all the unique names that Ravi had come across, this one ranked right up there in terms of intrigue value. Ravi promised himself that one day he would ask his CEO how he got this name. He picked up his phone and said, ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘It’s been over three months since my secretary left and I have received no replacement yet. If this is how your hiring team deals with my requirements, I dread to think what they must be doing to others in this company,’ said Tat Savitur. ‘If you are free, can I see you now?’ Ravi said, aware that he had to dispel any wrong notions that the CEO may have formed about him and his team. ‘Yes, come over.’ As he walked towards Tat Savitur’s cabin, he made a quick call to his head of hiring. ‘What’s the latest on Tat Savitur’s secretary? I am on my way to his office.’ ‘We are on it, Ravi. In the last two months we interviewed twenty candidates and he has rejected all of them. I wonder if he knows what he is looking for because, by now, we have no idea. Please don’t tell him that! Merely tell him we are lining up more candidates.’ ‘I don’t think this meeting is going to be an easy one. I suspect he has already formed an opinion that we all are quite ineffective. I asked to see him to prevent any more damage to our reputation.’ ‘Any update for me?’ asked Tat Savitur with a serious look as Ravi came into his room. ‘My hiring team tells me you rejected twenty candidates in the last two months,’ said Ravi. ‘They feel it’s easier to find you a rocket scientist,’ said Ravi. ‘Jokes apart, Ravi, I urgently need that secretary. Not one of those candidates made the cut. There are too many things lined up and our IPO is round the corner.’ ‘I can assure you that my hiring team is working hard to fill this vacancy.’ ‘But that’s surely not working. Maybe they need to work smart and not hard.’ ‘To be fair to them, my hiring team is confused and seem to be hitting a wall. The more candidates we reject the more difficult the task becomes. Word spreads in the market.’ ‘I can’t help it if they don’t find me the right candidate.’ ‘We did find a candidate whom you liked. But then that person demanded a higher CTC, which you refused.’ ‘You guys know that I am always against bending the rules for anyone. I believe this is something we should never do. After all, rules are the very foundation on which organizations are built and sustained.’ ‘I know. Maybe it will help if you tell us what exactly are you looking for in a candidate? After all, a secretary is just another secretary.’ ‘I must admit that most of the candidates did possess the requisite secretarial skills. What I am looking for is that special kind of maturity where the person has little need to use information as power.’ ‘Sorry, it’s not clear to me,’ I said. ‘As an HR professional, I am sure you know that every individual has a need for power. A few acquire legitimate power by virtue of their position and designation. And there are those who seek it through their proximity to power centres or through the information they have access to. My secretary will be privy to a lot of confidential information and I want a person who knows how to handle this.’ ‘Okay, that makes a lot more sense now. Rest assured we will fill this position soon.’ ‘We should have had this discussion a long time ago,’ said Tat Savitur, laughing. More interviews were set up and finally, Tat Savitur found the person he was looking for. Sometimes things just fall into place. Mukherjee used to work as a secretary with a company in Kolkata. His boss, transferred to Delhi three years ago, had insisted that he too move with him. Mukherjee rented a two-bedroom flat in one of the societies in the trans-Yamuna region. His wife, their school-going daughter, and his widowed mother stayed with him. To his misfortune, his company shut all operations three months ago. Not wanting to disrupt his daughter’s education, Mukherjee decided against returning to Kolkata and resolved to look for a job in Delhi NCR. Things were looking bad for Mukherjee. Very few companies were in need of a secretary. He was willing to consider any role in the administration function too. And even in that domain, nothing seemed to be happening. His savings were getting depleted and to make matters worse, the landlord, who had not been paid for over a month, had served them a notice. His wife had started giving tuitions at home but her income was just enough to put food on the table. His mother contributed in her own way – every day she was at the nearby temple. Durga Puja was forty-five days away and she knew that her goddess would show them a way out of their misery. And then Mukherjee received the offer letter from Ravi. Tat Savitur was delighted to have finally found an extremely efficient and mature secretary. He referred to him as his ‘devil’s advocate’ – someone who kept him honest, and escalated matters in time. With the IPO planned in the coming year, a consulting firm was hired to develop the roadmap for growth. Tat Savitur kept long hours and was happy to see that Mukherjee often stayed back late. One day, Mukherjee walked into Tat Savitur’s room and placed his leave application in front of him. ‘What? You want a month off? You know there is so much going on here and you have been here barely a month. The consulting firm will make their presentation in three weeks and then we have the road shows in the four metros,’ said a visibly upset Tat Savitur. ‘I know, sir, but it’s for Durga Puja. In-between I can come for a couple of days,’ replied Mukherjee. ‘When is Durga Puja?’ ‘October 11th to 15th.’ ‘Then take that week off.’ ‘It’s Durga Puja, sir,’ said Mukherjee, with a surprised look on his face. ‘Why do you look surprised? If anyone has to be surprised it has to be me.’ ‘I am surprised that you do not know why I am surprised.’ ‘Hope there’s no strategy here, Mukherjee. What are you really trying to say?’ ‘You know how important Durga Puja is for us, sir.’ Tat Savitur had always believed Durga Puja was a very big festival only in Kolkata. Having been in Delhi for just over a year, he had no idea of how big the festival was there too. ‘Are you planning to go to Kolkata?’ ‘My family is here. I will be in Delhi.’ ‘If you are not going to Kolkata, why do you want a month’s leave?’ ‘I am the convener for Durga Puja in my locality.’ ‘What does that mean?’ ‘There are hundreds of puja pandals all over Delhi. In each locality the people contribute money, and various events and celebrations are held. Theatre is one of the biggest draws. I am the director for the plays and hence need to be away for a month.’ ‘But you know there is so much to do here.’ ‘It’s only for a month. And I will make up for lost time when I am back.’ ‘Even if I want to say yes, you have no leave to your credit.’ ‘Since you are the CEO, sir, I am sure you can sanction me a month’s advance leave,’ suggested Mukherjee. ‘You know the rules do not permit that, especially for someone who is just a month old here,’ said Tat Savitur, convinced that the matter was settled. Mukherjee walked out of Tat Savitur’s office saying he would be back in a moment. He returned a few minutes later and placed another sheet of paper in front of Tat Savitur. It was his hand-written letter of resignation. ‘What’s this, Mukherjee? Do you know what you are doing?’ Mukherjee politely nodded his head. ‘You said you have your widowed mother, your wife, and your child to take care of. Why aren’t you thinking of them?’ asked a visibly upset Tat Savitur. Mukherjee stood there mute, like a statue. ‘When I hired you, don’t you recollect that you had been unemployed for nearly three months? You know that the economy is not particularly good right now and jobs are not easy to come by. You could remain unemployed for a longer period.’ Tat Savitur was sure that this would make him see some sense. Mukherjee’s response was enigmatic, ‘I also recall you telling me, sir, that it took you over two months to find me.’ ‘So?’ ‘I will be away only for a month and going by the history here, you will not find my replacement that soon. I shall come back and again apply for the job.’ Tat Savitur stared at Mukherjee not believing what he had just heard. Suddenly, he laughed aloud when he realized the irony of the situation. He picked up the leave application, ‘Okay, let me talk to HR and see what I can do.’ Tat Savitur spoke with Ravi the next day and narrated what had transpired between him and Mukherjee. Ravi found it difficult to stop laughing. ‘I like that man’s guts. I tell you, he is a real asset to us. I suggest let’s grant him a month’s leave in advance, as a special case. He will truly appreciate this gesture,’ said Tat Savitur. Ravi did not want to let go of the opportunity to mildly confront his CEO on his decision to bend the rules. ‘Aren’t we bending some rules here?’ he asked. ‘I know. One of the reasons I never bend any rules is that others often cite that as a precedent. But I think Mukherjee has a valid point. Let’s make some changes to our leave policy for employees and incorporate this new clause to be used only in special cases.’ ‘And who will decide if a case is special?’ ‘That’s why you are the HR head here, Ravi. You and your team figure that out,’ said Tat Savitur with a laugh. ‘Sure, will do. And, by the way, I think all our employees now owe thanks to Mukherjee,’ said Ravi. Mukherjee had managed to do what HR failed to do for so many years – make Tat Savitur take a U-turn on company policy.",

      "content": "11 When the Comfort Zone Makes Strategic Sense What had started off as whispers was now being openly spoken about by his divisional heads. Not all of them yet, but five out of the six. It was time for him to do something about it. Udith was the CEO of a large conglomerate with six manufacturing locations spread over six northern states in India. A divisional general manager (DGM) headed each location. Over the past few weeks, five of his DGMs had separately spoken to him on how they felt that their finance heads were more loyal to Jain, the corporate finance head, who reported to Udith. Nothing wrong with that, really, as these guys did have a dotted line reporting into Jain. What bothered them was that lately, Jain would often be the first one to know whenever things went wrong under their command, even before they themselves were told about it. And Jain had a knack of raising these issues with Udith without double-checking with the DGMs first, and they looked unprepared and cut a sorry figure whenever Udith chose to speak with them on these issues. Udith decided to get the views of his corporate human resource officer (CHRO) Bipin before discussing this with Jain. ‘The DGMs seem to be uncomfortable that their finance guys appear to be very close to Jain,’ said Udith. ‘Yes, they have voiced these concerns to me too in confidence,’ said Bipin. ‘Oh, really? How long has this been going on?’ ‘Well, off and on. In fact, some of them have accused these guys of spying for Jain.’ ‘That’s a serious accusation,’ said Udith, raising his eyebrows. ‘What bothers them is that Jain then uses this information to make them look bad in your eyes and, more so, during the quarterly board meetings,’ said Bipin. Bipin, however, chose not to share with Udith that the DGMs were equally concerned about Udith’s knee-jerk reactions every time Jain shared such information with him. ‘Do you think those finance guys really spy for Jain?’ ‘I don’t think so. But I know that Jain asks those guys to bring to his notice any wrongdoing they observe in their respective divisions. And since they all are CAs handpicked by him, they believe they owe their allegiance to him.’ ‘Five of our six DGMs have expressed these concerns to me and we must do something about it,’ said a concerned Udith. ‘I agree,’ said Bipin. ‘Why don’t we move some of these finance heads to other functions as part of our leadership development policy and get some new guys who are non – CAs in their place?’ said Udith thinking that he had found a solution. ‘Difficult in this case. You know Jain hires only chartered accountants like himself and believes that these are career finance people and do not need cross functional exposure.’ ‘Why not hire some folk with an MBA to head the finance function in our divisions? We can surely move them around later.’ ‘You know that’s like a red rag to Jain. He has an intense dislike for MBAs, and thinks that all they do is make presentations and talk about everything with expertise in nothing.’ ‘So, you are saying we are helpless?’ ‘On the contrary, I think that right now we may have a slight opportunity. Our finance guy in Indore resigned last month and we are interviewing candidates. There is one applicant, a smart person with an MBA, but I have not passed him on to Jain.’ ‘Let me meet him. This could be our chance.’ ‘I am okay as long as you manage Jain,’ said Bipin, smiling. The following week, Udith interviewed Shishir, the candidate with an MBA degree. Little did Shishir know that he would soon be the main actor in an intense drama! Jain argued vehemently that Shishir did not make the cut but Udith logically countered his every objection. Jain finally gave in, knowing that there was only a point up to which one could resist the boss. At the same time, Jain was sure that he would be the one to write the last act in this script. Over the next one year, Shishir settled in well and got along with his peers. The DGM at Indore was delighted to have him on his team and often sought his views on matters that were beyond the purview of the finance function. Shishir too felt good that his views were being solicited and was happy that he had joined this place. If anything bothered him, it was the nagging feeling that Jain was not too favourably disposed towards him. On one of his trips to the corporate office, Shirish decided to speak with CHRO, Bipin, with whom he had developed a trust relationship, and seek his advice. ‘What does Jain have against me?’ asked Shishir. ‘What makes you feel this way?’ asked Bipin.. ‘Initially, I thought I was imagining things. Then I noticed that during the divisional review meetings, where you too have been present, he picks up insignificant errors in the documents prepared by me and tends to blow them out of proportion.’ Bipin had indeed noticed this. In fact, he had also observed that Jain would wait for Shishir to take his seat and then take a place diagonally opposite away and across from Shishir. ‘I think you are possibly imagining some of these things. I don’t think Jain has anything against you,’ said Bipin, trying to sound convincing. ‘Do you recall the review meeting held four months ago? Jain picked up such an inconsequential error and raised his voice and addressed me. And before I could reply, you heard Udith say, “If the assumptions are themselves wrong then this meeting is a waste of time.” I am grateful that my DGM stepped in and sorted it out. But if this continues, just imagine what Udith will think of me.’ To Bipin, it was clear that Shishir was caught in a crossfire for no fault of his own. Jain was focused on proving him a failure, and thus settling his debate with Udith that CAs were more competent and trustworthy than MBAs. Shishir interrupted his thoughts, ‘Does Jain have anything against MBAs?’ ‘I don’t think so. But why do you ask?’ ‘The other day, when I submitted a report to him, he said that I lacked attention to detail. He then quickly said that had I been a CA, it would not have happened.’ ‘I am sure he said that without meaning it.’ ‘Yes, I know. That does not bother me as much as the way he shouts across the room pointing out small errors during the review meeting. That gives me nightmares. And the next review is just a month away,’ said a visibly upset Shishir. Bipin realized that if nothing was done soon, they might lose Shishir. And as if reading his mind, Shishir spoke, ‘Honestly, I sometimes think I may be better off taking another job. I know Jain does not like me but I have no clue why. I have a dotted line reporting into him and his opinion on me will be important when my performance review comes up.’ To Bipin it was clear that if Shishir quit then that would be the last time the company could hire an MBA in finance. Udith would lose and Jain, who would see this as a clear victory, could become unmanageable in the future. ‘Okay, let’s for a moment agree that what you are feeling is true. What is the guarantee that you will not be faced with a similar situation wherever you go? Remember, the higher one is in the organization hierarchy, the greater the degree of ambiguity that one has to deal with,’ said Bipin. ‘I can see where you are going. If I can surmount this problem here then that would be a great learning for me. I also know that at our levels, if we keep changing jobs too soon, the market does not see it favourably,’ said Shishir. ‘Would you like me to broach this subject with Jain?’ asked Bipin feeling relieved. ‘No, please don’t. If you do that he will know I have spoken with you. Let me try and figure this out. If I need help, I will reach out to you,’ said Shishir. ‘Sounds like a plan,’ replied Bipin. He badly wanted Shishir to overcome the situation. That would open the door to many more MBAs joining the finance functions and help relieve the stress faced by the DGMs. Shishir did not know it, but a lot depended on him. ‘And, by the way, thank you for listening to me. I already feel unburdened,’ said Shishir as he shook hands and walked out of Bipin’s room. The impending review meeting continued to haunt Shishir till one day when his prayers were suddenly answered. Of all the unlikely places, it happened at a branch of the public sector bank where he held his account. In order to kill time while waiting for the cashier to call out his token number, he moved over to chat with the security guard. He was a tall, strapping person in his early fifties who looked like an ex-service man. Two things caught his eye – the thick bushy moustache that extended six inches on either side of his nose and the large, single-barrel gun slung over his broad shoulder. Actually, three things caught the eye if one included the bandolier filled with shells that was looped across his chest, forming an ‘X’ with the gun’s sling. ‘Are you an ex-serviceman?’ enquired Shishir, trying to strike up a conversation. ‘Yes sir, army,’ replied the security guard. ‘This gun must be very different from the one you used in the army.’ The guard laughed and said, ‘No comparison. But it is the best I have.’ ‘The bank gave you this weapon?’ ‘No, it is mine. This job is only offered to those who have a licensed gun,’ said the guard. Shishir decided to have some fun, ‘What if someone came close to you and pressed a pocket knife into your waist? How will this gun help?’ The other guy gave a sheepish grin, exposing tobacco-stained teeth. ‘Ha, ha … then this gun is useless. I will politely request the person to move at least six feet away, from out of my comfort zone into the kill zone, so that I can threaten him with the gun.’ They laughed together and then the cashier called out Shishir’s token number. As he was collecting his cash, Shishir had an epiphany. The safest place for anyone was to be within three feet of the security guard, within the comfort zone. Shishir was quite relaxed as the review date drew close. The corporate and the divisional teams exchanged pleasantries as they walked into the boardroom and made themselves comfortable on either side of the 25-feet-long table. Bipin observed that Jain kept waiting for Shishir to take his place at one corner and then walked to a seat diagonally across. As everyone opened the folders placed in front, Bipin gave a bemused smile as he saw Shishir collect his papers and move across and take a seat next to Jain. ‘Should you not be on the other side with your team?’ enquired Jain in a slightly raised voice. ‘I thought that, since I have a dotted line reporting to you sir, it’s important that I be available to answer any queries that you may have.’ Udith, who was seated nearby, overheard the conversation and addressed Jain, ‘I agree with Shishir. The divisional finance head must be seated next to you. Let’s implement this in our other locations too when we have reviews there.’ As always, during the first thirty minutes of the meeting, Jain was quiet and kept looking for errors in the documents given to him. Suddenly he noticed something out of place and pulled out his red marker and circled it. Shishir, whose eyes were on Jain all the while, moved his head slightly towards him and whispered, ‘That’s a small typing error, sir.’ And so it went on throughout the meeting. Every time Jain drew a circle over something, Shishir moved towards him and whispered something. He was within the comfort zone! Bipin kept smiling as this sideshow unfolded. He looked relieved and thought, ‘Round one to the MBA!’",

      "content": "11 When the Comfort Zone Makes Strategic Sense What had started off as whispers was now being openly spoken about by his divisional heads. Not all of them yet, but five out of the six. It was time for him to do something about it. Udith was the CEO of a large conglomerate with six manufacturing locations spread over six northern states in India. A divisional general manager (DGM) headed each location. Over the past few weeks, five of his DGMs had separately spoken to him on how they felt that their finance heads were more loyal to Jain, the corporate finance head, who reported to Udith. Nothing wrong with that, really, as these guys did have a dotted line reporting into Jain. What bothered them was that lately, Jain would often be the first one to know whenever things went wrong under their command, even before they themselves were told about it. And Jain had a knack of raising these issues with Udith without double-checking with the DGMs first, and they looked unprepared and cut a sorry figure whenever Udith chose to speak with them on these issues. Udith decided to get the views of his corporate human resource officer (CHRO) Bipin before discussing this with Jain. ‘The DGMs seem to be uncomfortable that their finance guys appear to be very close to Jain,’ said Udith. ‘Yes, they have voiced these concerns to me too in confidence,’ said Bipin. ‘Oh, really? How long has this been going on?’ ‘Well, off and on. In fact, some of them have accused these guys of spying for Jain.’ ‘That’s a serious accusation,’ said Udith, raising his eyebrows. ‘What bothers them is that Jain then uses this information to make them look bad in your eyes and, more so, during the quarterly board meetings,’ said Bipin. Bipin, however, chose not to share with Udith that the DGMs were equally concerned about Udith’s knee-jerk reactions every time Jain shared such information with him. ‘Do you think those finance guys really spy for Jain?’ ‘I don’t think so. But I know that Jain asks those guys to bring to his notice any wrongdoing they observe in their respective divisions. And since they all are CAs handpicked by him, they believe they owe their allegiance to him.’ ‘Five of our six DGMs have expressed these concerns to me and we must do something about it,’ said a concerned Udith. ‘I agree,’ said Bipin. ‘Why don’t we move some of these finance heads to other functions as part of our leadership development policy and get some new guys who are non – CAs in their place?’ said Udith thinking that he had found a solution. ‘Difficult in this case. You know Jain hires only chartered accountants like himself and believes that these are career finance people and do not need cross functional exposure.’ ‘Why not hire some folk with an MBA to head the finance function in our divisions? We can surely move them around later.’ ‘You know that’s like a red rag to Jain. He has an intense dislike for MBAs, and thinks that all they do is make presentations and talk about everything with expertise in nothing.’ ‘So, you are saying we are helpless?’ ‘On the contrary, I think that right now we may have a slight opportunity. Our finance guy in Indore resigned last month and we are interviewing candidates. There is one applicant, a smart person with an MBA, but I have not passed him on to Jain.’ ‘Let me meet him. This could be our chance.’ ‘I am okay as long as you manage Jain,’ said Bipin, smiling. The following week, Udith interviewed Shishir, the candidate with an MBA degree. Little did Shishir know that he would soon be the main actor in an intense drama! Jain argued vehemently that Shishir did not make the cut but Udith logically countered his every objection. Jain finally gave in, knowing that there was only a point up to which one could resist the boss. At the same time, Jain was sure that he would be the one to write the last act in this script. Over the next one year, Shishir settled in well and got along with his peers. The DGM at Indore was delighted to have him on his team and often sought his views on matters that were beyond the purview of the finance function. Shishir too felt good that his views were being solicited and was happy that he had joined this place. If anything bothered him, it was the nagging feeling that Jain was not too favourably disposed towards him. On one of his trips to the corporate office, Shirish decided to speak with CHRO, Bipin, with whom he had developed a trust relationship, and seek his advice. ‘What does Jain have against me?’ asked Shishir. ‘What makes you feel this way?’ asked Bipin.. ‘Initially, I thought I was imagining things. Then I noticed that during the divisional review meetings, where you too have been present, he picks up insignificant errors in the documents prepared by me and tends to blow them out of proportion.’ Bipin had indeed noticed this. In fact, he had also observed that Jain would wait for Shishir to take his seat and then take a place diagonally opposite away and across from Shishir. ‘I think you are possibly imagining some of these things. I don’t think Jain has anything against you,’ said Bipin, trying to sound convincing. ‘Do you recall the review meeting held four months ago? Jain picked up such an inconsequential error and raised his voice and addressed me. And before I could reply, you heard Udith say, “If the assumptions are themselves wrong then this meeting is a waste of time.” I am grateful that my DGM stepped in and sorted it out. But if this continues, just imagine what Udith will think of me.’ To Bipin, it was clear that Shishir was caught in a crossfire for no fault of his own. Jain was focused on proving him a failure, and thus settling his debate with Udith that CAs were more competent and trustworthy than MBAs. Shishir interrupted his thoughts, ‘Does Jain have anything against MBAs?’ ‘I don’t think so. But why do you ask?’ ‘The other day, when I submitted a report to him, he said that I lacked attention to detail. He then quickly said that had I been a CA, it would not have happened.’ ‘I am sure he said that without meaning it.’ ‘Yes, I know. That does not bother me as much as the way he shouts across the room pointing out small errors during the review meeting. That gives me nightmares. And the next review is just a month away,’ said a visibly upset Shishir. Bipin realized that if nothing was done soon, they might lose Shishir. And as if reading his mind, Shishir spoke, ‘Honestly, I sometimes think I may be better off taking another job. I know Jain does not like me but I have no clue why. I have a dotted line reporting into him and his opinion on me will be important when my performance review comes up.’ To Bipin it was clear that if Shishir quit then that would be the last time the company could hire an MBA in finance. Udith would lose and Jain, who would see this as a clear victory, could become unmanageable in the future. ‘Okay, let’s for a moment agree that what you are feeling is true. What is the guarantee that you will not be faced with a similar situation wherever you go? Remember, the higher one is in the organization hierarchy, the greater the degree of ambiguity that one has to deal with,’ said Bipin. ‘I can see where you are going. If I can surmount this problem here then that would be a great learning for me. I also know that at our levels, if we keep changing jobs too soon, the market does not see it favourably,’ said Shishir. ‘Would you like me to broach this subject with Jain?’ asked Bipin feeling relieved. ‘No, please don’t. If you do that he will know I have spoken with you. Let me try and figure this out. If I need help, I will reach out to you,’ said Shishir. ‘Sounds like a plan,’ replied Bipin. He badly wanted Shishir to overcome the situation. That would open the door to many more MBAs joining the finance functions and help relieve the stress faced by the DGMs. Shishir did not know it, but a lot depended on him. ‘And, by the way, thank you for listening to me. I already feel unburdened,’ said Shishir as he shook hands and walked out of Bipin’s room. The impending review meeting continued to haunt Shishir till one day when his prayers were suddenly answered. Of all the unlikely places, it happened at a branch of the public sector bank where he held his account. In order to kill time while waiting for the cashier to call out his token number, he moved over to chat with the security guard. He was a tall, strapping person in his early fifties who looked like an ex-service man. Two things caught his eye – the thick bushy moustache that extended six inches on either side of his nose and the large, single-barrel gun slung over his broad shoulder. Actually, three things caught the eye if one included the bandolier filled with shells that was looped across his chest, forming an ‘X’ with the gun’s sling. ‘Are you an ex-serviceman?’ enquired Shishir, trying to strike up a conversation. ‘Yes sir, army,’ replied the security guard. ‘This gun must be very different from the one you used in the army.’ The guard laughed and said, ‘No comparison. But it is the best I have.’ ‘The bank gave you this weapon?’ ‘No, it is mine. This job is only offered to those who have a licensed gun,’ said the guard. Shishir decided to have some fun, ‘What if someone came close to you and pressed a pocket knife into your waist? How will this gun help?’ The other guy gave a sheepish grin, exposing tobacco-stained teeth. ‘Ha, ha … then this gun is useless. I will politely request the person to move at least six feet away, from out of my comfort zone into the kill zone, so that I can threaten him with the gun.’ They laughed together and then the cashier called out Shishir’s token number. As he was collecting his cash, Shishir had an epiphany. The safest place for anyone was to be within three feet of the security guard, within the comfort zone. Shishir was quite relaxed as the review date drew close. The corporate and the divisional teams exchanged pleasantries as they walked into the boardroom and made themselves comfortable on either side of the 25-feet-long table. Bipin observed that Jain kept waiting for Shishir to take his place at one corner and then walked to a seat diagonally across. As everyone opened the folders placed in front, Bipin gave a bemused smile as he saw Shishir collect his papers and move across and take a seat next to Jain. ‘Should you not be on the other side with your team?’ enquired Jain in a slightly raised voice. ‘I thought that, since I have a dotted line reporting to you sir, it’s important that I be available to answer any queries that you may have.’ Udith, who was seated nearby, overheard the conversation and addressed Jain, ‘I agree with Shishir. The divisional finance head must be seated next to you. Let’s implement this in our other locations too when we have reviews there.’ As always, during the first thirty minutes of the meeting, Jain was quiet and kept looking for errors in the documents given to him. Suddenly he noticed something out of place and pulled out his red marker and circled it. Shishir, whose eyes were on Jain all the while, moved his head slightly towards him and whispered, ‘That’s a small typing error, sir.’ And so it went on throughout the meeting. Every time Jain drew a circle over something, Shishir moved towards him and whispered something. He was within the comfort zone! Bipin kept smiling as this sideshow unfolded. He looked relieved and thought, ‘Round one to the MBA!’",

      "content": "12 The Smartest Appraisal Meeting Arshad was quite fed up. Why did Ron always leave his appraisal till the last hour? Was he trying to give him a message? It was nearing 7 p.m. that Friday evening in Noida and Arshad knew it would be another long evening as he slowly made his way to the MD’s office. If only their roles could be reversed, for just once, he could tell Ron what he actually thought of him. This would be his third appraisal review with Ron. He had been rated average over the last two years and he expected no better this year too. With Ron you could never expect anything better, especially if you were in a support function. Ron had spent over three decades in marketing in different regions across the globe. Three years ago, the US-based parent company had sent him to India to head the development centres here. For Ron, support functions existed only for one reason – to support. The secretary had left for the day and the offices were virtually empty, barring the pantry boy who usually stayed behind till Ron left for the day. Arshad pushed the door open after knocking on it softly. Ron was waiting for him. ‘Thank you for coming, Arshad. I know it’s pretty late but I’m keen to get your appraisal done today.’ Moving a stack of papers on his desk aside, he continued, ‘In fact, you are the last of all my executive team members to be appraised.’ Arshad, who was the head of HR & Facilities, took a seat and chose not to say anything at this stage. He knew that Ron, who loved to talk, would soon ask the questions and answer them too. Ron pulled out a few sheets from a file and began reading from them, ‘Hmm … I see that employee attrition has been contained.’ Arshad sat up straight, feeling good that the discussions had started on a positive note. ‘But then, I guess that all the functional heads should get equal credit for this,’ continued Ron. Arshad would have loved to give a curt response. Instead, he said, ‘I agree on that, Ron, but had I not worked closely with all of them, I don’t think we would have achieved this.’ Ron gave a patronizing smile, ‘At your level, Arshad, I am sure you do not expect me to just reward you on how well you co-ordinate things here. Can we talk a bit more about the strategic HR initiatives that you and your team are supposed to be putting in place?’ It was obvious that the pit bull, tenacious as always, was clamping his jaws tight. Whenever Ron used vague words like ‘strategic HR’ Arshad knew he was treading on thin ice. Once the discussions turned subjective, the boss would always win. To try and present any arguments now would be akin to fighting a crocodile in water. All that remained then would be the reptile’s death roll. It was clear that Ron had made up his mind and was bent on giving him the usual ‘average’ rating again. Arshad wondered if he should give in early or pretend to have a stab at it, even though the outcome seemed predictable. Ron loved to win. And he loved it more when his adversary put up a fight. It left him in a good mood while his adversary could land a few punches himself. Arshad decided to put up a tough fight initially and later concede defeat. As he prepared to defend, the intercom on Ron’s desk came to life. The security guard was calling from the gate. Some unexpected visitors were demanding to see Ron. Ron passed on the instrument to Arshad. ‘Who are these guys who want to see me at this time?’ he wondered. ‘Arshad here. Let me speak with them. Who? Two local politicians and they are already on their way up?’ Ron, who was listening to the conversation, looked very upset. There goes my appraisal, thought Arshad, as he said to Ron, ‘Let me handle this.’ A minute or so later, the two politicians were ushered into the room by a security person who seemed to show more deference towards them than to Ron or Arshad. Arshad and Ron stood up to receive the unwelcome guests. Ron, a big man by any standards, suddenly felt dwarfed by the man-mountain in white, who stood in front of him with folded hands. He appeared to be smiling but his thick moustache covered that completely. Like a turtle with a retracted neck, his large bullet-shaped head seemed to rest in the space between his broad shoulders. He was surely over six feet tall. Or taller, if one were to add his invisible neck. Arshad christened him Turtle. The other person with Turtle mercifully had a small build and was fidgety with eyes forever darting around. He reminded Arshad of a mouse, and that became his name. Arshad took charge of the situation. He asked the guests to be seated on the sofa in the corner of the office, and ordered the pantry boy to get the usual tea and biscuits. ‘Good evening, sir, sorry to disturb you so late, but we have to cover all companies in Noida in the next two days,’ said Turtle, getting straight to business. ‘No issue at all. What can we do for you?’ said Ron, trying to be as polite as possible. Before moving to India from the US, Ron had been briefed about these local politicians. ‘Be polite and show courtesy whenever you meet them. Their utility value may be limited, but don’t ever underestimate their nuisance value. Forewarned is forearmed,’ he had been told. Turtle gestured to Mouse, ‘Give them their receipt.’ Mouse quickly produced a pad and tore off a sheet and handed it to Arshad who looked at it, and passed it on to Ron. It was a pre-signed receipt for donation of ten lakh rupees, made out to Turtle’s local fund. ‘What is this about?’ asked Ron, avoiding eye contact with Turtle. He directed his question at Mouse. Turtle looked offended and placed his large palm on Mouse’s thigh, a signal for him to keep quiet. ‘This land, on which all the ten buildings occupied by your company stand, was once owned by the villagers here. Your companies take away our land but cannot provide employment to our youth because they are not qualified. We know you cannot employ them, so we will not force you. However, we still need to rehabilitate our young men. So, I am starting a fund for this and all companies are making generous contributions.’ Pausing for breath, Turtle continued, ‘I understand that your company has 12,000 employees and fifteen offices all over the world. So, we feel you can easily afford this amount. In fact, smaller companies are giving much more than this.’ Ron was flabbergasted. None of those pre-departure seminars had prepared him for this. Sensing Ron’s discomfiture, Arshad seized the initiative and addressed Turtle directly. ‘You must be aware that we are a subsidiary of an American company. There is a law in America called The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If our company gives any donations, however small, then Mr Ron Hector, our MD here, and his boss in America will both be sent to prison.’ ‘You must be joking. Do you think we are that stupid to believe you? Tell them how much money we have already collected,’ Turtle said, turning to Mouse and asked him to show copies of receipts made out to other donors. Arshad interjected before things could get out hand. ‘I know you would have got donations from many companies, but none of them will be American companies. You may check your receipt books if you so like.’ Mouse moved closer to Turtle and whispered through clenched teeth, ‘I think he is right, boss.’ All he got in return was a glare. Turtle was unwilling to give up so easily. He continued, ‘I saw your Jaguar parked below. You can afford such expensive cars but cannot give any money for our youth?’ He had a challenging gleam in his eye as he looked at Ron directly. ‘That is not his own car,’ Arshad said calmly, ‘It was given to him by the company and will be taken back by the company later.’ Ron’s head kept moving between Arshad and Turtle. Turtle was now getting very upset. ‘We are not asking you for cash. We are giving you a proper receipt, so what is the problem? You mean to say such a big man like him cannot take such a small decision?’ he addressed his last remark to Arshad. Arshad had an answer ready, and he stepped in for the kill. ‘You are right. He may be the MD of this company but the truth is that he really has no powers. All decisions are taken in America.’ Turtle vehemently shook his head indicating that he believed none of this. ‘I know this sounds silly but it’s the truth. If I were to say that he has to check with his bosses in America before going to the toilet here, even that would be no exaggeration.’ Ron was listening to everything that was being said and he was less than amused. Arshad was definitely beginning to enjoy himself. Turtle, however, was still sceptical. ‘You cannot fool me. I know that when it is morning here, it is night in America. Does he keep waking up his bosses throughout the night to get decisions?’ It was an enlightened Turtle now, thought Arshad. ‘Good point. You see, mostly he postpones decisions till he can get instructions from there. But if there is an urgent decision, then he will take that after second-guessing his bosses in America. Later on, he will get the decision ratified.’ Listening to Arshad’s assessment of his role, Ron felt terrible. He knew that Arshad was genuinely attempting to extricate him from a delicate situation but surely, he could be a bit less brutal? Turtle threw up his hands and stood up, completely exasperated. He seemed furious. All his plans for the million rupees seemed to be vaporising into thin air. Damn the US government and damn this impotent MD! His face grew red and he seemed to be groping for the right words. As if on cue, the pantry boy walked in with the now-forgotten cups of tea. That seemed to be the last straw. ‘Take the bloody tea away!’ said Turtle in disgust, ‘This big-shot MD with an expensive Jaguar cannot even take the smallest of decisions! I pity him. I am sure tomorrow he will have to get this tea approved by his bosses in America. Let us spare him the agony. Let’s not waste our time here anymore. And if they want to have some free tea they are welcome to my office!’ He seemed thrilled at having had the last word. Mouse quickly ran forward and opened the door as Turtle stormed out of the room. Arshad accompanied them to the main door, but his presence was not even acknowledged. Arshad walked back into Ron’s room, a triumphant look on his face. If that wasn’t a shining example of his ability to strategically manage a situation using his people skills, then what was? The arrival of those politicians was surely well-timed. ‘Shall we continue with my appraisal, Ron?’ Ron was feeling quite exhausted. ‘It’s late, Arshad. Let’s do it another day. And thanks for getting rid of those two gentlemen.’ ‘You are welcome, Ron. And good night.’ Arshad walked out of the room, trying to suppress a smile. He felt fairly certain that his competent handling of the situation would give Ron something to think about. In any case, the experience of being able to say all those things about Ron while he was present in the room had been entirely worth it! ‘Good night, Arshad.’ Ron’s voice seemed distant. That night, Ron tossed around in his bed for a long time. Something was bothering him. Was it the way Arshad reduced him to a non-entity? Or was it because there was an undeniable grain of truth in what Arshad said? Either way, Ron knew he was going to have to carefully re-evaluate his previous assessment of Arshad.",

I am sure tomorrow he will have to get this tea approved by his bosses in America. Let us spare him the agony. Let’s not waste our time here anymore. And if they want to have some free tea they are welcome to my office!’ He seemed thrilled at having had the last word. Mouse quickly ran forward and opened the door as Turtle stormed out of the room. Arshad accompanied them to the main door, but his presence was not even acknowledged. Arshad walked back into Ron’s room, a triumphant look on his face. If that wasn’t a shining example of his ability to strategically manage a situation using his people skills, then what was? The arrival of those politicians was surely well-timed. ‘Shall we continue with my appraisal, Ron?’ Ron was feeling quite exhausted. ‘It’s late, Arshad. Let’s do it another day. And thanks for getting rid of those two gentlemen.’ ‘You are welcome, Ron. And good night.’ Arshad walked out of the room, trying to suppress a smile. He felt fairly certain that his competent handling of the situation would give Ron something to think about. In any case, the experience of being able to say all those things about Ron while he was present in the room had been entirely worth it! ‘Good night, Arshad.’ Ron’s voice seemed distant. That night, Ron tossed around in his bed for a long time. Something was bothering him. Was it the way Arshad reduced him to a non-entity? Or was it because there was an undeniable grain of truth in what Arshad said? Either way, Ron knew he was going to have to carefully re-evaluate his previous assessment of Arshad.",

      "content": "13 Nowhere to Hide Rajendra Narula, or RN as he preferred to be addressed, oversaw corporate affairs and the sales & marketing functions at India’s largest tyre company. He was a tall man with a pronounced paunch and walked with a slight stoop. His eyes were deep-set, mostly half-closed that made him look like an absent-minded professor. He was anything but that. He had a sharp memory and could recall complete details of past discussions and events with frightening clarity. You never challenged him on facts. And if you crossed him, he remembered it and made sure you always paid the price. He knew what was going on in every other department and created the perception that he influenced one’s career, whether one reported to him or not. Moorthy, who had recently joined the company as head of R&D and quality control, met Narula as part of his induction. ‘You know, Moorthy, I was away the day you were interviewed by our CEO. Later when he sought my views on your resume, I did tell him that you would be an asset here. Welcome to our company!’ Moorthy knew Narula was lying. His appointment letter had been signed and given to him by the CEO immediately at the end of that interview. He played along, though. ‘I appreciate that, Mr Narula. Thank you!’ ‘Please call me RN,’ said Narula, with a grin. It was only then that Moorthy noticed the large photograph of a guru on the wall behind him. RN’s grin bore a strong resemblance to the beatific smile in the photograph. Every organization has its share of war stories and Moorthy soon learnt that in this company, most of the war stories centred around RN. One such story had its beginning when one of his subordinates had corrected him on some facts during his presentation to the board. RN did not sack that particular person – that would be too easy and painless. He created situations where that person felt humiliated day in and day out. The poor guy quit in a month’s time. The CEO held his regular review meetings with his direct reportees once a month, and it was an unwritten rule at these meetings that they would avoid negative comments on each other’s functional areas. RN was the only person who breached this rule. In one such meeting, the CEO expressed grave concern that the warranty costs on tyres had doubled from two per cent to four per cent of sales and this impacted the bottom line in a big way. RN was quick to blame Moorthy: ‘Over the past few months our quality standards have dropped drastically. And if this continues, I am afraid the warranty costs will only go up further.’ Three months earlier, RN had made some major changes in the company’s warranty policy where dealers were now empowered to replace tyres free of cost, subject to some limits. As per the previous policy, all warranty cases had to be cleared by the quality control department. It was evident to Moorthy that the main cause of the problem was these policy changes, but he had no intention of confronting RN. Some of the others present in that room knew that the real problem lay in the warranty policy. Moorthy was a diligent technocrat and he would not have let the quality standards get diluted. It was also clear to them, and to Moorthy, as to who would go down at the end of this episode. The CEO turned towards Moorthy, ‘Please have a look at our quality processes. Each day’s delay costs us a lot of money. Even our board is very worried and wants us to stop bleeding at once.’ ‘I will personally monitor this right away,’ said Moorthy. Moorthy sought some time from the CEO immediately after the review meeting. ‘I did not want to raise it in the meeting, but I think the real problem is the changes made by RN in the warranty policy,’ Moorthy told him and went on to apprise the CEO on how this impacted warranty costs. ‘Let me talk with RN,’ said the CEO, well aware of the reasons why Moorthy chose not to confront RN. The CEO spoke with RN who responded, ‘Our warranty policy is in line with what our competitors offer. If we do not offer that, we will lose sales.’ ‘How come the warranty costs of our competitors continue to be around two per cent?’ asked the CEO. ‘That’s exactly my point,’ replied RN. ‘Obviously, their quality has not dropped.’ ‘In any case, why don’t you have a look at the policy?’ suggested the CEO. RN insisted that the problem was with quality. ‘Why don’t we have Moorthy report to me for the next six months and I will fix the problem,’ said RN, quite certain that it was Moorthy who had spoken to the CEO about the holes in the warranty policy. ‘I am sure Moorthy will soon have things under control,’ said the CEO and closed the discussion. Moorthy called his team and briefed them on what had transpired in the meeting, and instructed them to quickly check for any breach in the quality processes. While his team agreed to this, each one of them was convinced that the real problem was in the way the warranty policy had been changed. Some even went to the extent of suggesting that there could be some kind of connivance between RN and the dealers. Moorthy ignored that. As the employees moved out of his room, one stayed back. He had early worked in sales and RN had wanted him to be sacked. On HR’s request, Moorthy had agreed to his transfer to the quality department. ‘I think I know what is going on in the sales department,’ said the employee. Moorthy let him speak; what he heard was quite alarming yet seemed quite plausible. He appreciated the employee’s concerns and at the same time cautioned him against talking about something for which he had no evidence. Moorthy wondered whether to inform the CEO about what he had just heard. He knew that the CEO rarely confronted RN. Even if he did on this occasion, he would quote Moorthy. The consequences would be disastrous for him. At the same time, if the allegations were true and if nothing was done, it would continue to hurt the company in a big way. As he continued to mull over his dilemma, there was a knock on his door and the CFO walked in and sat down on the sofa. ‘Why did you not confront RN?’ he asked. Moorthy laughed and said, ‘You know why!’ ‘Obviously I know, but I think RN has bigger plans. I was just talking with the CEO. I believe RN wanted you and your function to report to him and he has said he will solve the problem at once.’ ‘And what did the CEO say?’ asked a worried Moorthy. ‘Of course, no way that is happening. But I did not come here to alarm you, Moorthy. Just to warn you that RN will stop at nothing.’ RN had made his intentions clear but to take him on would not be easy. As the CFO exited, Moorthy looked around the room as if looking for an answer on what he could do. As if in response, the words of one of his teachers came back to him at that moment. ‘It’s easy to be virtuous when the stakes are low. But it takes real courage to stand on the side of truth when everything of yours is at risk.’ He sought a meeting with RN. ‘Good afternoon, RN. I am getting our quality standards audited and this will take another week or so. However, I still do think that our warranty policy is a bit too liberal and that could be the real problem,’ said Moorthy. ‘Why are we discussing this again, Moorthy? Did the CEO not make it clear that the problem lay with our quality processes? I suggest you just focus on getting that audit done. I am sure that once you set that right, our product quality will improve and the warranty costs would soon be back to normal level,’ said RN with a dismissive tone. ‘RN, the CEO never said that quality is the problem. All he suggested was that we first review our existing processes and I have initiated steps for this,’ said Moorthy. ‘Then let’s wait for the report before jumping to any other conclusions,’ said RN and turned towards his computer as if to suggest that the meeting was over. It was now or never. ‘In fact, the main reason I came to see you was to talk to you about the rumours I have heard about you,’ said Moorthy. RN sat up straight. ‘What do you mean?’ he demanded with his voice raised. Moorthy took a long breath. ‘I have been hearing these things for quite some time and have been wanting to share them with you. There is some talk going around that there was this occasion when we had to fly to Mumbai to interview some sales candidates and that you had HR shift the venue to Chennai so that you could attend your guru’s convention there.’ Moorthy pointed to the large photo hanging on the wall behind RN. ‘And not to mention the additional costs that the company had to bear for the to-and-fro flights between Mumbai and Chennai for twenty candidates.’ The silence in the room was deafening. Moorthy tried to hide his fear. At the same time, RN tried to feign anger but it was clear that he was very worried. Moorthy soon realized that there was some truth in what he had just said and decided to drive home his advantage. He mustered some more courage and continued, ‘By the way, there is also some talk doing the rounds that three years ago your holiday abroad was paid for by some of our dealers.’ He waited for the outburst from RN. There was none. ‘I don’t know what you are talking about, Moorthy. People can say all kinds of things. If you do find any proof of what you are saying, please bring it to me,’ said RN. His voice was now just a notch above a whisper. ‘RN, I just wanted to share with you what I heard. I would like to leave it there,’ said Moorthy, beginning to feel sorry for this bully. He then took his leave. RN’s quick response the next day surprised Moorthy. RN met the CEO and informed him that he was simultaneously instituting a separate review of the warranty policy. The quality audit came out clean. The warranty policy was soon revised and warranty claims came down to less than two per cent of sales. Moorthy stopped shadow-boxing with fears of his impending doom.",

      "content": "14 The Right Choice Gaurav and Payal were a study in contrast. Gaurav believed that the end always justified the means. Winning was paramount; he worked harder than everyone else to achieve that. He was a man in a hurry and had immense self-belief. To him, leadership was all about leading from the front. Failure was never an option. Not for him or for any of his team members. Payal believed that leadership was all about believing in your team, which in turn motivated ordinary people to do extraordinary things. To her, success and failure were two sides of the same coin. One could learn a lot from failure and avoid repeating what caused it in the future. Success too offered many lessons, which could be replicated, going forward. Motivating people was all about holding people accountable without hurting their dignity. A glimpse into Gaurav’s and Payal’s pasts would throw more light on how their beliefs and values were formed. Gaurav’s father was a junior government official in a small town in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. His childhood memories were mostly that of his father being perennially angry. Gaurav studied hard and was an excellent student, without ever receiving a word of praise from his father. Once when he had returned late from a friend’s place, his father called up the friend later to check if Gaurav was telling the truth. His only goal in life was to excel at everything he attempted. Payal’s father was a professor at the Agricultural University, Palampur in Himachal Pradesh. He was soft-spoken and taught her to observe and learn from nature and often reminded her that nature never played favourites. She recalled the occasion when she and her father were being driven to the market; their car had struck the rocky side of the cliff and was badly damaged. Luckily, neither Payal nor her father was injured. It was clearly their driver’s mistake. All her father did was to enquire with the driver if he was okay. They had returned home and the car was sent to the workshop. At night, over dinner, she had asked her father why he had not held the driver accountable, as it was his fault. ‘Do you think the driver wasn’t aware of this, Payal? Did you not notice he was already shaking and expected to be shouted at? It’s only a car and that can be easily repaired. If I had shouted at him and hurt his dignity at that time, I would never have been able to repair that,’ he had replied. And then he said something that would stay with her for a very long time: ‘Remember, Payal, while dealing with people, it always helps to be kind than to be clever.’ Gaurav and Payal had completed their MBA from different management institutes, majoring in finance. Nine years later, they both joined one of India’s largest private sector banks in its head office in Mumbai. Gaurav’s portfolio comprised a large number of corporate accounts while Payal managed small and medium enterprises. Gaurav considered all his colleagues, including Payal, as his main competitors. Success was all about making your colleagues look bad so that you looked good in comparison. Gaurav was rated as ‘Best Performer’ for two years running during which he and his team earned the highest bonuses and for the second consecutive year, his department was rated as the best in employee engagement scores. He was ruthless with himself and believed that this bestowed on him the right to push his team to the extremes. Whenever a team member slipped up, he would berate him or her in public, and then step in to ensure that work never suffered. Some of his best managers had resigned in the last two years. Gaurav branded them as ‘ungrateful and self-serving people’ totally lacking in commitment. Payal had been consistent throughout her career. She and her team usually achieved 90-95 per cent of their targets. But that was not to say that she was soft on her team. She let them know that they, as a team, could have read the market signals better and made appropriate course corrections. She had her share of attrition within her team, but these were mostly at the lower rungs – people with two to three years’ experience. Her managers stayed with her for longer periods. She was of the firm belief that it was the motivated managers who formed the bedrock of any organization as it was they who converted fresh talent into productive resources on a continuing basis. To Gaurav she was a competitor. But Payal saw him as a colleague. Right now, the only subject being discussed in the corridors of the head office was who would be selected to head the new bank that had been recently acquired. Would it be Gaurav or would it be Payal? The consensus was that Gaurav was a clear front-runner. Shweta Desai, the CMD of the bank, announced the decision after due deliberations with the board: Payal would head the new entity. Gaurav was shattered. He had been absolutely sure that, given his performance over the last few years, he would land the job hands down. He had already informed some of his friends and his wife of the impending change in his responsibilities. Whilst his team members were busy congratulating Payal, Gaurav sought an urgent meeting with Shweta. If required, he was willing to go all the way to the other members of the board to challenge the decision. ‘I have performed better than Payal on every parameter. I believe it is a mistake that she has been selected over me,’ said a visibly upset Gaurav. ‘I understand how you feel, Gaurav. The board has made its choice and we must accept it. I can assure you that we examined all aspects before arriving at the decision,’ replied Shweta. ‘I think the bank has been very unfair to me.’ ‘I don’t think you need to feel diminished in any way, Gaurav, just because Payal was selected. You are still one of our valued leaders.’ ‘I would like to know the criteria on which you decided to choose her over me.’ ‘It was never about just choosing one person over the other. We know that over 60 per cent of mergers and acquisitions are known to fail due to cultural incompatibility. We were clear that whoever we picked, would have to be high on people capabilities too. And Payal made the cut.’ ‘How can you say that? I have always scored better than Payal. I was rated Best Performer for two years running. My team and I always exceeded our numbers, which she rarely did.’ ‘At what cost, Gaurav? Some of your best senior-level people have left you. I know that you step in and hold fort for some time, but this attrition only sets us back in our efforts to build a leadership pipeline.’ Gaurav shook his head. ‘Are you telling me that none of her people have left her?’ ‘I never said that. Just look at the people she loses. These are mostly at lower levels. And remember that some of her direct reportees have moved on to key positions in the bank.’ ‘So that makes her people skills better than mine?’ ‘Gaurav, have you seen the way Payal deals with her subordinates when they fail her? She never humiliates or hurts their dignity. On the contrary, don’t you think you are too hard on your subordinates in similar situations?’ said Shweta. Gaurav was buying none of that. ‘I always step in and make sure the work does not suffer.’ ‘That’s a short-term solution, Gaurav. Just see the long-term damage it does,’ said Shweta, not wanting to be too hard on him. ‘So now you will use this short-term versus long-term argument to justify a wrong decision,’ said Gaurav, clearly not willing to listen. ‘All I am saying is that a “moment of truth” about leadership is how we treat subordinates when they fail us. Treat them with dignity and they walk out of our rooms swearing by us. On the contrary, humiliate them and they walk out swearing at us. These things do have a long-term impact on organizations,’ said Shweta, wanting to end the discussion. Gaurav had saved his best for the last. ‘If that is true, what do you say to the fact that my department has scored the highest in employee engagement scores for two consecutive years? I think you are clearly biased. You chose Payal because she is a woman!’ Things had surely got out of hand now. Shweta decided to catch the bull by the horns. ‘I wouldn’t go there, Gaurav. HR has enough data from exit interviews of employees who left you.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I wasn’t keen to bring it up, but you just do not want to listen. We know how you have coerced your team members to give high scores.’ ‘That’s not true,’ said a visibly surprised and slightly defensive Gaurav. ‘It’s difficult to accept the truth, but figures don’t lie, Gaurav. I am afraid we must treat this matter as closed,’ said Shweta.",

Gaurav’s father was a junior government official in a small town in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. His childhood memories were mostly that of his father being perennially angry. Gaurav studied hard and was an excellent student, without ever receiving a word of praise from his father. Once when he had returned late from a friend’s place, his father called up the friend later to check if Gaurav was telling the truth. His only goal in life was to excel at everything he attempted. Payal’s father was a professor at the Agricultural University, Palampur in Himachal Pradesh. He was soft-spoken and taught her to observe and learn from nature and often reminded her that nature never played favourites. She recalled the occasion when she and her father were being driven to the market; their car had struck the rocky side of the cliff and was badly damaged. Luckily, neither Payal nor her father was injured. It was clearly their driver’s mistake. All her father did was to enquire with the driver if he was okay. They had returned home and the car was sent to the workshop. At night, over dinner, she had asked her father why he had not held the driver accountable, as it was his fault. ‘Do you think the driver wasn’t aware of this, Payal? Did you not notice he was already shaking and expected to be shouted at? It’s only a car and that can be easily repaired. If I had shouted at him and hurt his dignity at that time, I would never have been able to repair that,’ he had replied. And then he said something that would stay with her for a very long time: ‘Remember, Payal, while dealing with people, it always helps to be kind than to be clever.’ Gaurav and Payal had completed their MBA from different management institutes, majoring in finance. Nine years later, they both joined one of India’s largest private sector banks in its head office in Mumbai. Gaurav’s portfolio comprised a large number of corporate accounts while Payal managed small and medium enterprises. Gaurav considered all his colleagues, including Payal, as his main competitors. Success was all about making your colleagues look bad so that you looked good in comparison. Gaurav was rated as ‘Best Performer’ for two years running during which he and his team earned the highest bonuses and for the second consecutive year, his department was rated as the best in employee engagement scores. He was ruthless with himself and believed that this bestowed on him the right to push his team to the extremes. Whenever a team member slipped up, he would berate him or her in public, and then step in to ensure that work never suffered. Some of his best managers had resigned in the last two years. Gaurav branded them as ‘ungrateful and self-serving people’ totally lacking in commitment. Payal had been consistent throughout her career. She and her team usually achieved 90-95 per cent of their targets. But that was not to say that she was soft on her team. She let them know that they, as a team, could have read the market signals better and made appropriate course corrections. She had her share of attrition within her team, but these were mostly at the lower rungs – people with two to three years’ experience. Her managers stayed with her for longer periods. She was of the firm belief that it was the motivated managers who formed the bedrock of any organization as it was they who converted fresh talent into productive resources on a continuing basis. To Gaurav she was a competitor. But Payal saw him as a colleague. Right now, the only subject being discussed in the corridors of the head office was who would be selected to head the new bank that had been recently acquired. Would it be Gaurav or would it be Payal? The consensus was that Gaurav was a clear front-runner. Shweta Desai, the CMD of the bank, announced the decision after due deliberations with the board: Payal would head the new entity. Gaurav was shattered. He had been absolutely sure that, given his performance over the last few years, he would land the job hands down. He had already informed some of his friends and his wife of the impending change in his responsibilities. Whilst his team members were busy congratulating Payal, Gaurav sought an urgent meeting with Shweta. If required, he was willing to go all the way to the other members of the board to challenge the decision. ‘I have performed better than Payal on every parameter. I believe it is a mistake that she has been selected over me,’ said a visibly upset Gaurav. ‘I understand how you feel, Gaurav. The board has made its choice and we must accept it. I can assure you that we examined all aspects before arriving at the decision,’ replied Shweta. ‘I think the bank has been very unfair to me.’ ‘I don’t think you need to feel diminished in any way, Gaurav, just because Payal was selected. You are still one of our valued leaders.’ ‘I would like to know the criteria on which you decided to choose her over me.’ ‘It was never about just choosing one person over the other. We know that over 60 per cent of mergers and acquisitions are known to fail due to cultural incompatibility. We were clear that whoever we picked, would have to be high on people capabilities too. And Payal made the cut.’ ‘How can you say that? I have always scored better than Payal. I was rated Best Performer for two years running. My team and I always exceeded our numbers, which she rarely did.’ ‘At what cost, Gaurav? Some of your best senior-level people have left you. I know that you step in and hold fort for some time, but this attrition only sets us back in our efforts to build a leadership pipeline.’ Gaurav shook his head. ‘Are you telling me that none of her people have left her?’ ‘I never said that. Just look at the people she loses. These are mostly at lower levels. And remember that some of her direct reportees have moved on to key positions in the bank.’ ‘So that makes her people skills better than mine?’ ‘Gaurav, have you seen the way Payal deals with her subordinates when they fail her? She never humiliates or hurts their dignity. On the contrary, don’t you think you are too hard on your subordinates in similar situations?’ said Shweta. Gaurav was buying none of that. ‘I always step in and make sure the work does not suffer.’ ‘That’s a short-term solution, Gaurav. Just see the long-term damage it does,’ said Shweta, not wanting to be too hard on him. ‘So now you will use this short-term versus long-term argument to justify a wrong decision,’ said Gaurav, clearly not willing to listen. ‘All I am saying is that a “moment of truth” about leadership is how we treat subordinates when they fail us. Treat them with dignity and they walk out of our rooms swearing by us. On the contrary, humiliate them and they walk out swearing at us. These things do have a long-term impact on organizations,’ said Shweta, wanting to end the discussion. Gaurav had saved his best for the last. ‘If that is true, what do you say to the fact that my department has scored the highest in employee engagement scores for two consecutive years? I think you are clearly biased. You chose Payal because she is a woman!’ Things had surely got out of hand now. Shweta decided to catch the bull by the horns. ‘I wouldn’t go there, Gaurav. HR has enough data from exit interviews of employees who left you.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I wasn’t keen to bring it up, but you just do not want to listen. We know how you have coerced your team members to give high scores.’ ‘That’s not true,’ said a visibly surprised and slightly defensive Gaurav. ‘It’s difficult to accept the truth, but figures don’t lie, Gaurav. I am afraid we must treat this matter as closed,’ said Shweta.",

      "content": "15 A Helping Hand It was 8 a.m. on a bright Sunday morning in October in Delhi. Nischay had promised to take his wife Nisha and their ten-year-old daughter to Appu Ghar, a popular theme park, and then they would have lunch at an open-air restaurant at Connaught Place. As Nisha was getting ready, Nischay’s mobile phone rang. The caller ID showed it was Harshvardhan. She had to answer it. ‘Hello Mr Harshvardhan, Nischay is in the shower. He will call you back as soon as he is out.’ ‘Good morning, Nisha. That’s fine. Just tell him that I would like to see him at my place by 9.30 a.m. today. Have a nice day!’ Nisha could sense her blood pressure rise. She sat down on the bed as her daughter, all dressed up, came running in and asked, ‘How do I look, mummy?’ Nisha stood up and patted her daughter on her cheek. ‘You look great, baby. Now, go back to your room and I will be with you soon.’ As the child walked back to her room with slow, measured steps, she could hear the door being shut behind her. She knew that her mother was upset about something. ‘All set?’ asked Nischay, as he came out, patting his hair dry. ‘You did not tell me you had a meeting with Harshvardhan at nine-thirty this morning!’ ‘No, I don’t have a meeting with him.’ ‘Don’t lie to me, Nischay. Harshvardhan just called and asked you to be at his place by 9.30 a.m.’ ‘God, not again. He is going to ruin our plans. What did you tell him?’ ‘I told him you would call him once you were out of the shower.’ ‘I promise you, there was no meeting planned. You could have told him about our plans for the day?’ ‘Why should I? He is YOUR client. You tell him. Hope you are not going to ruin our day again?’ said Nisha, clearly upset. ‘That’s not fair. You know he is my biggest client and that, right now, my agency fully depends on him to keep us afloat,’ said Nischay. ‘We were so much better off when you had that regular job two years ago. At least, you had time for us, and we were happy.’ ‘Now please don’t bring that up again, Nisha. I promise I will make up for this soon.’ ‘So, you are not going to call him and tell him about our plans?’ ‘How can I? He may want to approve his next year’s budget today.’ ‘So, what do I tell our daughter? She is so excited.’ ‘I am so sorry, Nisha … I promise I will make up for all this soon.’ ‘The least you can do is inform Harshvardhan about our plans for the day. Maybe he will defer the meeting.’ ‘Shall do that after my meeting with him.’ Nisha knew she was wasting her time expecting her husband to even try and salvage the situation. He seemed to be mortally scared of Harshvardhan. As Nischay pulled out his Honda Amaze from the basement parking, the thought troubling him was that Nisha simply refused to understand how he was struggling to hold on to this major account, coveted by some of the biggest advertising agencies in the country. Harshvardhan produced fuel additives for diesel trucks. A chemical engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur, he had completed his master’s in petroleum engineering from a reputed college in the US, and then worked for over two decades with a large petrochemicals company there. He was credited with developing many useful compounds and additives that were used in the petroleum industry. On his return to India in the early eighties, he had set up a plant that produced additives. A short, stocky person, he was known to be a street fighter when it came to winning in business. Harshvardhan’s company had the biggest market share of the fuel additives market and his products commanded a premium. He was a big spender on advertising and sales promotions and targeted truck drivers through liberal incentive schemes. In fact, he was right up there in the client-agency-supplier food chain. Nischay parked his car on the side of the road, some distance away from his apartment complex, and called Rohin, his creative director. ‘Are you back from Mumbai? Harshvardhan is back and he has just summoned me for a meeting this morning,’ he said. Two months ago, Harshvardhan had seen a Pirelli calendar and insisted that his agency develop a similar one, in a smaller size, to be distributed amongst all truck drivers. Six models were shortlisted, contracts signed, and the photo shoot had been planned for Saturday, which was the day before. ‘Nischay, you should have also come to Mumbai. The shoot went off well but let me tell you, that guy is impossible!’ ‘Harshvardhan sounded upset when I spoke with him this morning. I need to quickly know what exactly happened,’ said Nischay. ‘Well, you know he came to Mumbai a day prior. He was staying at The Oberoi. On Friday evening he hosted a lavish party in his suite for all of us, including the models. As the evening progressed, Harshvardhan’s jokes became more bawdy and he kept hitting on one model in particular. When the party finally came to a close, he asked as to what time the shoot was scheduled the next day. ‘Our photographer told him it was at 11.30 a.m. when it was actually scheduled for 9.30 a.m. By the time Harshvardhan turned up the next day, we had wrapped up the shoot, and the models had left. He was naturally very upset but we all convinced him that he had heard the time incorrectly the previous evening.’ Nischay could sense big trouble ahead. ‘I don’t know whether that was a smart trick to pull on Harshvardhan. I am seeing him in the next hour and I fear he will just sack us.’ ‘That guy is such a pain, Nischay. We had no other choice. Just stay with our story regarding the timing of the shoot and I am sure it will all work out,’ said the creative director. The security person accompanied Nischay to the main entrance of the sprawling bungalow on Prithviraj Marg, from where a uniformed housekeeper ushered him into the large drawing room. Half an hour later, the same housekeeper walked in with a glass of buttermilk and kept it on a side table, saying, ‘Sir will join you soon.’ It was another forty-five minutes later that Harshvardhan walked in wearing a large bathrobe with his name monogrammed on it. ‘Please sit down. Just finished my massage.’ If he knew he was to have his massage, then why did he summon me so early, thought Nischay. He dismissed the thought in a hurry lest his client read his mind. ‘Not an issue, sir. In fact, I got the opportunity to admire the wonderful collection of items around me.’ ‘That’s my wife’s department. I called you to tell you that my trip to Mumbai has been an utter waste of time and money.’ ‘I am sorry that you missed the photo shoot, sir. I apologize for the misunderstanding,’ said Nischay. ‘I don’t think there was any misunderstanding. It’s that damn photographer who intentionally misled me. I don’t want your agency to ever hire his services. Not for my work or for any of your other clients’ work. That chap needs to be blacklisted right away.’ A relieved and much grateful Nischay immediately clutched at this straw. ‘When my creative director briefed me on what transpired in Mumbai, I right away issued instructions that we must blacklist the photographer. In fact, I plan to talk with the professional photographers’ association and inform them about his unprofessional behaviour.’ Harshvardhan smiled for first time that morning, ‘That’s good. Now, shall we look at our advertising plan for the rest of the year?’ Nischay felt relieved. Fifteen days later, when the calendar proofs were shown to Harshvardhan, he rejected each and every page and ordered a new shoot. Nischay had to bear all expenses incurred at Mumbai. The new shoot was planned for a month later at Kolkata. The last flight that evening from Delhi to Kolkata had attained cruising altitude. The ‘fasten seat belt’ sign had been turned off, and, as if on cue, most seat buckles popped open, overhead bin flaps were pulled open, laptops and reading material extricated. Queues started forming in front of the toilets. Nischay, who was seated in the economy class, decided to relax and catch up on some sleep. It would be two hours before they landed. He was tired and a hectic schedule awaited him the next day. Harshvardhan was seated ahead in the business class. Sleep eluded Nischay as his thoughts cut to a more recent scene at the airport, about an hour ago. They were seated in the lounge and Harshvardhan was on his third drink of Scotch. ‘How many models are we seeing tomorrow?’ ‘We have finalized two for this campaign,’ replied Nischay. ‘I thought I made it clear that I wanted to personally see the girls first before we shortlisted them.’ Nischay caught the extra emphasis on the word ‘personally’. ‘Well, sir, I was informed that you had selected them after seeing their portfolios.’ ‘Photographs don’t give the whole picture, do they, Nischay?’ Harshvardhan sounded angry. ‘Nobody informed me about the shortlist.’ ‘Sorry about this, sir.’ The scowl on Harshvardhan’s face was clear evidence that he was not happy. ‘Veg or non-veg, sir?’ the airhostess interrupted Nischay’s thoughts. He opened his eyes and waved her on. About on hour later, as the plane taxied to a halt, Nischay rushed across the aisle and removed Harshvardhan’s briefcase from the overhead bin. Harshvardhan walked ahead as they exited the airport. Nischay followed with their luggage on a trolley. The hotel representative met them inside the airport terminal and accompanied them to the hotel limousine. ‘Have a pleasant stay in Kolkata, sir,’ he said, as he opened the door for Harshvardhan and then softly shut it after him. Harshvardhan had failed to notice that initially the representative had made a move to open the door on Nischay’s side. Nischay thanked his stars that the hotel representative had picked up his cue when he subtly nodded towards Harshvardhan’s side of the car. It was rumoured that such a faux pas by another hotel’s representative had cost one of Harshvardhan’s assistants his job on a previous tour. As they entered the hotel, Harshvardhan turned towards Nischay. ‘I will just go over to the men’s room. Why don’t you check us in? Make sure they give me a king size bed.’ Nischay completed the check-in formalities. Harshvardhan’s room was on the club floor. ‘Shall we go up, Nischay?’ ‘Sure, sir. You are in room 722.’ ‘Thank you, I appreciate that. Come along, let’s check my room first.’ As the two of them waited for an elevator, the bellboy moved into the service lift with their luggage. As the elevator door closed, Harshvardhan made his move. ‘It’s been a long day, Nischay. Can you arrange a bottle of whisky for me? Nothing fancy, a good Indian brand will do. These hotel guys charge an arm and a leg. And by the way, I will appreciate it if you could also arrange a companion for me for the night.’ Nischay froze, as if a bolt of lightning had just struck him. The elevator soon opened on the seventh floor. ‘It’s okay, I can find my room from here. You better hurry and do the needful.’ ‘I’ll try, sir.’ His mind completely blank, Nischay made his way to the lobby. He remained shell-shocked as he sat down on a chair in the lobby. In the past, he had heard rumours of clients making such demands of their agencies and that some agencies did oblige. But not in his wildest dreams did he think it would ever happen to him. Nischay was realistic enough to know that life was not black and white and had to be lived in shades of grey. But this? Never! Time was running out. As he sat there in the lobby, Nischay never felt more alone in his life. He had to do something or else it could easily jeopardize at a moment the agency’s and his future. As he looked around hoping for some divine intervention, he remembered the advice given to him by his mentor who was a doyen in the advertising industry: ‘The best way to handle people like Harshvardhan is to pamper their ego and use humour to deal with them.’ Unfortunately, the joke was on him now. While still in a daze, his gaze fell upon some magazines displayed in the bookstore in front of him. With quick steps, he made his way out of the hotel in the direction of a liquor store which he had noticed as their car turned towards the hotel on their way in. Harshvardhan opened the door and looked beyond Nischay as he walked in meekly. Placing the bottle of whiskey on the table, he turned around and handed over a magazine to Harshvardhan. It was the latest edition of Debonair, modelled after Hugh Hefner’s Playboy. ‘Sir, I have never done this before, so I did not know how to fulfil all your wishes. I have placed fifteen thousand rupees inside the magazine. I guess someone in the hotel can help you find a companion for the night.’ And, as Harshvardhan kept looking at him, he made a quick exit, saying, ‘It’s all in your hands now, sir.’ The die had been cast and Nischay was prepared for any outcome. In the worst case, he would shut down his agency and pick up a regular job. Nisha at least would be happy then. Had he turned around at that instant, he would have seen a smile on Harshvardhan’s face.",

In the past, he had heard rumours of clients making such demands of their agencies and that some agencies did oblige. But not in his wildest dreams did he think it would ever happen to him. Nischay was realistic enough to know that life was not black and white and had to be lived in shades of grey. But this? Never! Time was running out. As he sat there in the lobby, Nischay never felt more alone in his life. He had to do something or else it could easily jeopardize at a moment the agency’s and his future. As he looked around hoping for some divine intervention, he remembered the advice given to him by his mentor who was a doyen in the advertising industry: ‘The best way to handle people like Harshvardhan is to pamper their ego and use humour to deal with them.’ Unfortunately, the joke was on him now. While still in a daze, his gaze fell upon some magazines displayed in the bookstore in front of him. With quick steps, he made his way out of the hotel in the direction of a liquor store which he had noticed as their car turned towards the hotel on their way in. Harshvardhan opened the door and looked beyond Nischay as he walked in meekly. Placing the bottle of whiskey on the table, he turned around and handed over a magazine to Harshvardhan. It was the latest edition of Debonair, modelled after Hugh Hefner’s Playboy. ‘Sir, I have never done this before, so I did not know how to fulfil all your wishes. I have placed fifteen thousand rupees inside the magazine. I guess someone in the hotel can help you find a companion for the night.’ And, as Harshvardhan kept looking at him, he made a quick exit, saying, ‘It’s all in your hands now, sir.’ The die had been cast and Nischay was prepared for any outcome. In the worst case, he would shut down his agency and pick up a regular job. Nisha at least would be happy then. Had he turned around at that instant, he would have seen a smile on Harshvardhan’s face.",

      "content": "16 Killing Two Birds with One Stone Romesh sent out two WhatsApp messages that Friday afternoon. The first one was sent to all his friends and groups: ‘Watch NDTV tonight at 7 p.m. I am participating in a panel discussion on the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry – Future Trajectory. Repeat telecast tomorrow at 2 p.m. Please forward to all friends and associates.’ The second was sent to his boss Arvind, the CEO and owner of south India’s largest pharmaceutical company where Romesh worked as the senior vice president – sales and marketing: ‘Dear Arvind ji, you would recall that last week I had participated in the panel discussion organized by NDTV. Happy to inform you that it will telecast tonight at 7 p.m. The repeat telecast will be tomorrow at 2 p.m. Appreciate if you could find the time to view this. Warm regards, Romesh.’ That evening his mobile phone was inundated with congratulatory messages and calls from many of his colleagues, friends and relatives. The following Monday morning, as he walked into his company’s eight-storey iconic tower on Anna Salai in Chennai, everyone including the security guard, the receptionist, the liftboy, and his secretary congratulated him. He was very happy. The word had spread quickly. As he settled in his plush leather chair, soaking in the glory, there was a knock on the door and MK walked in. ‘Congratulations, sir. My family and I watched your programme on Friday night. It was very good. You spoke the best,’ said MK. ‘Thank you, MK, I appreciate it,’ said Romesh. ‘Arvind sir is calling you. I also told him how good you were on TV,’ said MK Romesh thanked him once again and, picking up his writing pad and pen, he moved out of his office and headed for the top floor that was occupied by just three people: Arvind, his secretary and MK. Arvind was having his tea. There was an extra cup of tea on the table. ‘Morning, Romesh. You are just in time. Have asked for some tea for you too,’ Arvind said. Romesh thanked him and took a seat opposite him and reached out for his cup of tea. ‘Congratulations. You spoke well on that programme.’ ‘Thank you, sir. I am glad you found the time to see it,’ said Romesh. ‘Actually, I could not see it. This morning MK told me that you were the best speaker on the panel. Great show. Helps our company’s brand too.’ Romesh’s colleagues insisted on a party and that evening they met at their favourite watering hole. A few drinks later, they were interacting like college kids. ‘Heard that Arvind congratulated you,’ said Ajit, the HR head. ‘How did you know?’ asked Romesh. ‘MK, who else?’ ‘Yes, Arvind not only congratulated me but also said that I was the best speaker on the panel that night. And you know the greatest irony, guys … he did not even see the telecast,’ said Romesh. ‘Who told you that?’ asked the CFO. ‘Arvind himself. Apparently, MK, who had seen the telecast, updated him.’ ‘I just don’t get it. Why is MK such a big influence on Arvind? He is, after all, just his attendant,’ said an exasperated CFO who, like Romesh, was just under a year old in the company. Ajit, the longest serving employee among those present, spoke, ‘By now, you all know that MK is Arvind’s eyes and ears in our company.’ ‘Why does Arvind depend on him so much?’ asked Romesh addressing Ajit. ‘Muthu Kanthan, or MK as we know him, was their family retainer long before Arvind was born. Later, when Arvind was sent to one of those colleges in the UK, where the only criterion for admission was the family’s wealth, MK accompanied him as his caretaker. This possibly explains the high degree of trust between them. ‘While Arvind was in the final year, his father, the then chairman and founder of our company, died in a car accident, and Arvind had to cut short his education and return to India to take charge of the family business. Being the only son and the largest shareholder, it was only natural that he was made the CEO. MK was soon positioned in the corporate office to serve as his attendant and his eyes and ears!’ said Ajit. ‘This information should have been part of our induction programme,’ said Romesh, amidst loud laughter by the others. Ajit craned his neck forward and lowered his voice. ‘There is one more thing you all need to know. Remember, MK is quite conversant with the English language despite being a ninth-standard dropout. So be careful what you say in front of him. And have you guys noticed? Arvind will never confront any of us and often uses MK to unsettle us. Over the years, I have seen a number of senior level people made to leave in this way.’ The others were quiet as they absorbed these facts. The party broke up at 11 p.m. Romesh continued to represent the company on various industry forums and was often quoted in media reports on the pharmaceutical industry. He regularly appeared on TV and soon became a mini-celebrity within the company. None of this affected Arvind till the time some of his friends and relatives pointed out that Romesh’s frequent appearances in the media often made them wonder who the real CEO of the company was. Not long after that, MK walked into Romesh’s room when he was alone. ‘Yesterday, Arvind sir was talking about you.’ Romesh’s curiosity got the better of him. ‘What was it about?’ he asked. ‘When those distributors called on him after meeting with you, I heard Arvind sir telling them how our sales head spends most of his time in the office here rather than being out in the field across the country,’ said MK and sauntered out of Romesh’s room. If that was meant to be a cue, Romesh took it immediately. He prepared a tour plan to visit major markets over the next twenty days and sent it for Arvind’s approval. The approval came the next day. A subtle re-affirmation that MK’s information was indeed correct. A month later, MK again casually walked into Romesh’s room. ‘Where have you been travelling, sir? Yesterday, I heard Arvind sir tell someone on the phone that our sales head is always out in the field when he should rather be here at the office, monitoring our progress.’ These contradictory statements confused and upset Romesh. Was Arvind trying to send him some message? He recollected what Ajit had said that evening about Arvind using MK to unsettle his senior team members. Should he start looking around for another job? That night, he spoke with his wife about what had transpired over the last one month. ‘I’ve noticed that you’ve been very stressed out over the past few days. I assumed it was work pressure. But I guess it is Arvind’s unpredictable behaviour that is getting to you,’ said his wife. ‘And MK’s arrogance and his undue influence and power,’ said Romesh. ‘Maybe you should start looking around as a precaution,’ advised his wife. ‘Yes, I guess I should do that. But, somehow, I really want to teach both MK and Arvind a lesson.’ ‘You often say that it does not pay to antagonise anybody,’ said his wife. ‘Let’s just quit the system if we are not happy here. But please do look for a job in Chennai itself.’ ‘I am in no hurry, but yes I will start looking around,’ said Romesh. Some search firms responded positively and a couple of interviews were set up. MK continued to behave the way he always did, but it did not bother Romesh now as much as it did before. But, somewhere deep within himself, he still wanted to give it back to MK and Arvind. Within the next three months, Romesh landed a good job in Chennai and put in his papers. While Arvind tried to convince him to stay back, Romesh saw through this as MK had already informed him that the search to find his replacement was already on. Though they parted on amicable terms, Romesh continued to harbour a desire to teach Arvind and MK a lesson. Two months after quitting, Romesh decided to visit his old office for his final settlement. He borrowed a friend’s Mercedes E Class sedan. His own driver was curious to know the reason for borrowing this car, when they already had the Honda City. ‘My new company will soon allot me a similar car and I want you to get used to it. We will also be given a Toyota Camry, which would be used by my wife. So please look for another driver too,’ said Romesh. After finishing his work with the finance department and meeting some of his old colleagues, Romesh sought out MK. ‘I am looking out for a driver. In case you know someone, please let me know.’ ‘Congratulations, sir. I saw your E Class Mercedes. Your driver did inform me that you need a driver for your wife’s Camry,’ said MK ‘Yes, that’s right. Do let me know in case you come across a reliable person.’ ‘Sure, sir, I will look around,’ said MK. Ajit called him a month later. ‘Hi, Romesh looks like you quit a bit early.’ ‘Why do you say that?’ asked Romesh. ‘Yesterday, Arvind announced new perquisites for all function heads. We are now entitled to a Mercedes E Class sedan. And an additional Camry with driver for our spouses.’ ‘Yes, I know,’ blurted out Romesh. ‘How did you know? It was just announced yesterday,’ said a surprised Ajit. Romesh resisted the temptation to tell him about his own contribution in all this. ‘Remember MK had mentioned some time ago that our perquisites would be soon looked into? I never for a moment thought it would be such a bonanza. Congratulations!’ said Romesh. ‘Thanks. And Arvind has upgraded himself to an S class Mercedes.’ That evening, Romesh shared the new developments with his wife and how he had used MK to trick Arvind. ‘I wish I could see the look on Arvind’s face when he finds out the truth,’ said his wife. ‘Just you wait and see,’ said Romesh. ‘The game has only begun.’ A month later Romesh sought a meeting with Arvind under the pretext of providing him with some leads for pharmaceutical exports to Africa. MK was confused to see Romesh arrive in his old Honda City. ‘What will you have, Romesh?’ asked Arvind. ‘Just some green tea,’ said Romesh. ‘And congratulations, sir. I understand that all function heads have been allotted an E Class Mercedes each and their wives get chauffeur-driven Camrys. I wonder if I left too soon.’ ‘You can’t have any complaints, Romesh. MK informs me you have the same in your new company,’ said Arvind. ‘No, not really,’ said Romesh. ‘I still have only one car. The same old Honda city with the same old driver.’ The next day, Romesh received the call he was expecting. It was Ajit. ‘Hey, Romesh! Heard you met Arvind yesterday?’ ‘Yes, I had come to meet him.’ ‘When it rains, it pours. MK has been transferred to our plant in Tirunelveli with immediate effect.’ ‘I am happy for all of you,’ said Romesh. ‘You should have stayed, Romesh. Imagine, you would have enjoyed all this here. And no MK, either.’ ‘Not really,’ said Romesh, as he suppressed a smile.",

      "content": "17 The Power of Proximity Gopal’s feet dragged as he made his way out of his client’s office. Could he have done something different to salvage this account? Six years ago, this very client had supported Gopal in setting up his advertising agency. Ten minutes ago, the same client, who accounted for 70 per cent of his current business, had sacked his agency. Gopal had pleaded, ‘I am sorry if you feel let down, sir. I promise from now on I will personally oversee this account.’ ‘I really have nothing against you or your agency, Gopal. It’s just that my new marketing head feels that we need a fresh approach. And I need to give him a free hand if I am to hold him accountable,’ said his erstwhile mentor and CEO of the company. As Gopal made his way to the parking lot to pick up his car, his body language clearly showed that he was completely devastated. His inner voice, which helped him bounce back every time he faced such setbacks, seemed to have completely deserted him. The receptionist in his office noticed his condition as he made his way to his room. ‘Hope you are okay, Gopal?’ ‘I am fine. Could you please request Iyer to come over if he is free?’ said Gopal. ‘Sure,’ she said. Iyer, the creative director, and Gopal had worked together in one of India’s biggest advertising agencies prior to their starting this agency six years earlier. Unlike Gopal, who had only worked in the advertising industry all along, Iyer had worked with some large manufacturing companies earlier. ‘What happened Gopal? You look as if a car just hit you,’ said Iyer as he walked into Gopal’s room. ‘More like a truck,’ said Gopal with a feeble smile. ‘Looks like the meeting did not go off well?’ ‘It was a complete disaster! Our biggest client just sacked us. We are in big trouble,’ said Gopal. ‘It’s not the end of the world, Gopal. Clients have left us in the past and we have managed to survive,’ said Iyer. ‘Yes, I know, but none as large as this one. These guys accounted for over seventy percent of our revenues. I am worried for our agency and for our employees, especially those who left more secure jobs to join us and chose to believe in us.’ ‘Don’t worry, Gopal, this too shall pass and we will pull through,’ said Iyer. Both Gopal and him knew that this time things would not be the same. ‘I don’t know how to break this news to the rest of the team,’ said Gopal. There was a knock on his door. It was the receptionist. ‘Before I leave for the day, I thought I would remind you that the inauguration of Mr Talwar’s third factory is at 11 a.m. tomorrow.’ Gopal thanked her as she said good night and shut the door. ‘Let us wait for a day or two before we talk to the rest of the team,’ said Iyer. ‘I think we should do it tomorrow itself. In our industry, word spreads fast and I am sure someone will know of this soon. And I don’t want to go for the inauguration tomorrow. Let’s break the news here tomorrow,’ said Gopal. ‘I think we must go for the inauguration tomorrow. Talwar has a huge advertising account and who knows something miraculous could happen there,’ said Iyer. ‘I am not comfortable going there. Someone in their marketing team may be aware of our losing this client today. I am not ready for any fake sympathies,’ said Gopal. ‘I will go with you so you don’t have to interact with any of those guys. My sixth sense tells me that we have to be there.’ ‘If you say so,’ said Gopal. They did not go to their agency the next morning, choosing to reach the venue directly from their homes and arrived forty-five minutes ahead of schedule. A steady stream of people kept arriving. They sat down under the gazebo tent set up in the parking area of the new factory. Giant-sized promotional balloons with the company’s logo emblazoned on them were hoisted alongside its billboards. Over two thousand guests were expected to attend the event: employees, dealers, vendors, bankers and government officials. Some came to admire the extravagant proceedings, but clearly, the majority had come to mark their presence with the one man who seemed to hold their collective destiny in his hands: the grand old man who was the owner and chairman of the company, Mr Talwar. What had started off as a small trading firm four decades ago was today India’s largest consumer durables brand with a 52 per cent market share. Fully aware that every eye in the audience was fixed on him, Talwar stood tall on the podium surveying the crowd. While most of the faces had a look of joyous anticipation, there was one face in the middle row that wore a worried and forlorn look. That face belonged to Gopal. As he and Iyer sat there contemplating their problems, their thoughts were interrupted by some commotion in the front. Talwar, sensing there was still time for the function to start, stepped down from the stage to greet some of his important guests in the front rows. Iyer nudged Gopal: ‘Why don’t you go over and engage him in some conversation? Doesn’t matter what you say but make sure he is seen talking with you for at least a few minutes.’ ‘Where are you going with this Iyer?’ ‘Just look around you. Every eye in this place is on Talwar. See the marketing head standing in the corner there. From the time we arrived, I have only seen him trying to catch Talwar’s eye.’ ‘So?’ ‘Please do as I say. Keep him engaged. Remember it must be for a few minutes. And leave the rest to me. I think our miracle is about to happen,’ said Iyer. With no idea about what was happening, Gopal got up and moved purposefully towards the front rows. He had learned to trust Iyer’s advice. The immaculately dressed Talwar cut a tall and imposing figure. Gopal, admittedly, was rather short, and certainly lacking in style. When Talwar turned to him and extended his hand in his direction, Gopal hung on to it as if his life depended on it. Talwar, who was taken aback by the tight grip of Gopal’s handshake, seemed inwardly delighted at this public display of deference and enthusiasm from one of his agency heads. ‘Many congratulations to you sir. My agency and I are proud to be serving you,’ said Gopal. Talwar smiled graciously. ‘It would have been all the more wonderful, sir, if your late father could have been here on this historic day,’ said Gopal, not loosening his tight grip. Talwar moved his head closer to Gopal’s ear, as the chatter from the crowd made it difficult to hear and be heard. ‘Thank you for your kind words. Indeed, had my father been alive today, I am sure he would have been proud of the great heights I have achieved.’ For the next four minutes, Talwar continued speaking expansively about his achievements. And throughout those minutes, Gopal kept nodding his head as if in perfect agreement, while not letting go of Talwar’s hand. To many observers around, especially Vikrant, vice-president of marketing, who was watching from his corner, it seemed as if his boss and the agency head were engaged in a serious conversation. Not for a single moment did Vikrant’s eyes waver from the two of them. And not for a moment did Gopal slacken his grip on the chairman’s hand. The master of ceremonies soon picked up the microphone. Talwar pulled his hand away, gave Gopal a light pat on his shoulder and moved towards the stage. The event was about to begin. Gopal returned to his seat and shared with Iyer as to what had transpired between Talwar and him. Iyer, who had timed everything, gave him the thumbs up. As the event came to a close and people started moving towards the food tents, they noticed Vikrant quickly making his way towards them. Iyer whispered a few quick words to Gopal. ‘Looks like the chairman had a long and serious conversation with you? I hope all is well?’ said Vikrant. ‘Oh yes!’ replied Iyer, ‘Mr Talwar is obviously concerned about the need to increase sales, now that the third factory is about to start up. He spoke with Gopal on some of his thoughts and strategies on how to achieve that. He seemed to like what Gopal told him and has asked us to be ready with a new national campaign.’ And before Vikrant could notice Gopal’s surprised look, Iyer continued, ‘He has asked us to see him after getting your inputs on this. Can we see you tomorrow around 11 a.m. in your office?’ ‘Sure, come over,’ said Vikrant and moved away. The two of them decided not to stay for lunch. Gopal was clearly agitated. ‘What the hell are you up to, Iyer? We have just lost our biggest client and now with this you will make sure that Vikrant will also sack us once he learns the truth.’ ‘Just chill Gopal, and trust me,’ said Iyer. ‘I have worked in large family-run companies where all the power is concentrated in the hands of the founder. There is no way Vikrant will check with Talwar. For him, as with the rest of the employees, perception is reality. Remember, you spent a full four minutes with Talwar and he patted you on the shoulder as he parted from you. That’s all we need.’ The next day, Gopal and Iyer were in Vikrant’s office to discuss new approaches for the prospective campaign. On their way out, they checked with Talwar’s secretary whether he was free. She checked with Talwar and ushered them into Talwar’s office. The miracle was unfolding. ‘I have never seen such a large gathering as I saw at the inauguration yesterday, sir. It was a great function,’ said Iyer. He then went on to brief Talwar about their discussions with Vikrant and shared some thoughts on the new campaign that they were planning to push the increased production in the market. Talwar gave them a few pointers too. Iyer thanked Talwar for his thoughts and suggested that it would help if he could also share these thoughts with his VP Marketing so that everyone was on the same page. Talwar asked his secretary to get the Vikrant on the intercom. ‘Gopal and Iyer are here with me and we have been discussing the new campaign. I have asked them to look at a completely new positioning for our brand and now with this new plant going into production we will be the clear number one in India. I would like for them to present the new campaign in four weeks before I leave for my European holiday this summer.’ Four weeks later, Gopal made the presentation. He had fully incorporated the Chairman’s suggestions in the campaign. ‘I like it,’ said a gleeful Talwar and turned towards Vikrant. ‘What do you think?’ ‘I think the new positioning strategy is perfect. Gopal and his team have nailed it,’ he replied. ‘Who do you think gave them the idea?’ asked a beaming Talwar. Iyer addressed Vikrant, ‘That day, when we met the chairman after meeting you … most of these are his ideas…’ He then turned towards the chairman, ‘And the last three slides, which you felt were brilliant, were suggested by Vikrant, sir.’ ‘Great! So how soon can we launch this campaign?’ asked Talwar. The marketing head looked at Gopal who replied, ‘As it is an integrated multimedia campaign, sir, we should do it in three weeks.’ That year, out of the three agencies that worked for this client, the major share of advertising budget went to Gopal’s agency. His pipeline of business was full for the next two years and his agency more than made up for the loss in revenues from the other client.",

      "content": "17 The Power of Proximity Gopal’s feet dragged as he made his way out of his client’s office. Could he have done something different to salvage this account? Six years ago, this very client had supported Gopal in setting up his advertising agency. Ten minutes ago, the same client, who accounted for 70 per cent of his current business, had sacked his agency. Gopal had pleaded, ‘I am sorry if you feel let down, sir. I promise from now on I will personally oversee this account.’ ‘I really have nothing against you or your agency, Gopal. It’s just that my new marketing head feels that we need a fresh approach. And I need to give him a free hand if I am to hold him accountable,’ said his erstwhile mentor and CEO of the company. As Gopal made his way to the parking lot to pick up his car, his body language clearly showed that he was completely devastated. His inner voice, which helped him bounce back every time he faced such setbacks, seemed to have completely deserted him. The receptionist in his office noticed his condition as he made his way to his room. ‘Hope you are okay, Gopal?’ ‘I am fine. Could you please request Iyer to come over if he is free?’ said Gopal. ‘Sure,’ she said. Iyer, the creative director, and Gopal had worked together in one of India’s biggest advertising agencies prior to their starting this agency six years earlier. Unlike Gopal, who had only worked in the advertising industry all along, Iyer had worked with some large manufacturing companies earlier. ‘What happened Gopal? You look as if a car just hit you,’ said Iyer as he walked into Gopal’s room. ‘More like a truck,’ said Gopal with a feeble smile. ‘Looks like the meeting did not go off well?’ ‘It was a complete disaster! Our biggest client just sacked us. We are in big trouble,’ said Gopal. ‘It’s not the end of the world, Gopal. Clients have left us in the past and we have managed to survive,’ said Iyer. ‘Yes, I know, but none as large as this one. These guys accounted for over seventy percent of our revenues. I am worried for our agency and for our employees, especially those who left more secure jobs to join us and chose to believe in us.’ ‘Don’t worry, Gopal, this too shall pass and we will pull through,’ said Iyer. Both Gopal and him knew that this time things would not be the same. ‘I don’t know how to break this news to the rest of the team,’ said Gopal. There was a knock on his door. It was the receptionist. ‘Before I leave for the day, I thought I would remind you that the inauguration of Mr Talwar’s third factory is at 11 a.m. tomorrow.’ Gopal thanked her as she said good night and shut the door. ‘Let us wait for a day or two before we talk to the rest of the team,’ said Iyer. ‘I think we should do it tomorrow itself. In our industry, word spreads fast and I am sure someone will know of this soon. And I don’t want to go for the inauguration tomorrow. Let’s break the news here tomorrow,’ said Gopal. ‘I think we must go for the inauguration tomorrow. Talwar has a huge advertising account and who knows something miraculous could happen there,’ said Iyer. ‘I am not comfortable going there. Someone in their marketing team may be aware of our losing this client today. I am not ready for any fake sympathies,’ said Gopal. ‘I will go with you so you don’t have to interact with any of those guys. My sixth sense tells me that we have to be there.’ ‘If you say so,’ said Gopal. They did not go to their agency the next morning, choosing to reach the venue directly from their homes and arrived forty-five minutes ahead of schedule. A steady stream of people kept arriving. They sat down under the gazebo tent set up in the parking area of the new factory. Giant-sized promotional balloons with the company’s logo emblazoned on them were hoisted alongside its billboards. Over two thousand guests were expected to attend the event: employees, dealers, vendors, bankers and government officials. Some came to admire the extravagant proceedings, but clearly, the majority had come to mark their presence with the one man who seemed to hold their collective destiny in his hands: the grand old man who was the owner and chairman of the company, Mr Talwar. What had started off as a small trading firm four decades ago was today India’s largest consumer durables brand with a 52 per cent market share. Fully aware that every eye in the audience was fixed on him, Talwar stood tall on the podium surveying the crowd. While most of the faces had a look of joyous anticipation, there was one face in the middle row that wore a worried and forlorn look. That face belonged to Gopal. As he and Iyer sat there contemplating their problems, their thoughts were interrupted by some commotion in the front. Talwar, sensing there was still time for the function to start, stepped down from the stage to greet some of his important guests in the front rows. Iyer nudged Gopal: ‘Why don’t you go over and engage him in some conversation? Doesn’t matter what you say but make sure he is seen talking with you for at least a few minutes.’ ‘Where are you going with this Iyer?’ ‘Just look around you. Every eye in this place is on Talwar. See the marketing head standing in the corner there. From the time we arrived, I have only seen him trying to catch Talwar’s eye.’ ‘So?’ ‘Please do as I say. Keep him engaged. Remember it must be for a few minutes. And leave the rest to me. I think our miracle is about to happen,’ said Iyer. With no idea about what was happening, Gopal got up and moved purposefully towards the front rows. He had learned to trust Iyer’s advice. The immaculately dressed Talwar cut a tall and imposing figure. Gopal, admittedly, was rather short, and certainly lacking in style. When Talwar turned to him and extended his hand in his direction, Gopal hung on to it as if his life depended on it. Talwar, who was taken aback by the tight grip of Gopal’s handshake, seemed inwardly delighted at this public display of deference and enthusiasm from one of his agency heads. ‘Many congratulations to you sir. My agency and I are proud to be serving you,’ said Gopal. Talwar smiled graciously. ‘It would have been all the more wonderful, sir, if your late father could have been here on this historic day,’ said Gopal, not loosening his tight grip. Talwar moved his head closer to Gopal’s ear, as the chatter from the crowd made it difficult to hear and be heard. ‘Thank you for your kind words. Indeed, had my father been alive today, I am sure he would have been proud of the great heights I have achieved.’ For the next four minutes, Talwar continued speaking expansively about his achievements. And throughout those minutes, Gopal kept nodding his head as if in perfect agreement, while not letting go of Talwar’s hand. To many observers around, especially Vikrant, vice-president of marketing, who was watching from his corner, it seemed as if his boss and the agency head were engaged in a serious conversation. Not for a single moment did Vikrant’s eyes waver from the two of them. And not for a moment did Gopal slacken his grip on the chairman’s hand. The master of ceremonies soon picked up the microphone. Talwar pulled his hand away, gave Gopal a light pat on his shoulder and moved towards the stage. The event was about to begin.

It would be easily another thirty minutes before they reached Amroha in UP. This was to be the last stop on their itinerary before Vignesh and his managing director, Sujit, made the return journey to Delhi. ‘This could have been planned better. How late are we?’ Sujit’s anger was palpable. ‘Two hours, sir,’ replied Vignesh, the vice president of sales. ‘By now, we should have been halfway back to Delhi. I don’t like travelling on these roads after dark.’ ‘I had clearly instructed our dealers to avoid felicitations of any kind as you were keen to only discuss sales targets and move on quickly. But I am sure it’s a rare honour for them when you visit their dealership.’ Sujit seemed to mellow a bit. ‘That’s all right, but there was no need to invite virtually the whole town. How many were there in the last dealership we just visited? A hundred and fifty?’ Though it was dark inside the car, Vignesh could sense that his boss seemed rather pleased. ‘No sir, my estimate is it was well over two hundred.’ ‘These guys spend so much money on felicitating me,’ Sujit said, shaking his head. ‘Why can’t they spend all this money on increasing their marketing efforts to sell more of our tractors?’ Vignesh was clearly relaxed by now. He reached for his cellphone. ‘I will just call the Amroha dealer and tell him to cut out the ceremonies.’ Sujit said, rather quickly, ‘No, no. This time, let it be. Let’s not disappoint him. But the next time, yes, you must tell them that all this is unnecessary.’ ‘Sure, sir. By the way, do you know how this place Amroha got its name?’ said Vignesh, attempting to cheer up the mood in the car. ‘No, I don’t know,’ said Sujit. ‘Legend has it that the first part of the name comes from aam, the mangoes that this place is known for. The second part of its name comes from rohu, a variety of fish that is found in abundance here.’ ‘Interesting, I did not know that,’ said Sujit thoughtfully. ‘And, by the way, what are the Amroha dealer’s targets for the next three months?’ The time for small talk was clearly over. ‘An average of fifteen tractors per month.’ ‘Just that…’ Sujit didn’t complete the sentence as their car had pulled into the well-lit archway. They had reached Amroha. The dealer’s office building was fully decorated. Sujit was slightly overwhelmed by the scale of the arrangements at each of the dealerships he had visited on his trip. He was, however, rather pleased by the level of awe with which he was regarded. Once the usual garlanding and felicitations were over, Sujit, Vignesh and the dealer were soon seated in the dealer’s office. Sujit was a person who preferred to get straight to the point. ‘And what’s your sales target for the next three months?’ The question was addressed to the dealer who kept glancing at Vignesh, desperately seeking some hints. ‘And remember, with our new factory starting production next month, your sales targets will only increase,’ Sujit continued. ‘I will easily sell around fifty tractors per month, sir,’ the dealer replied. The scene in the room was a study in contrasts. While the dealer exuded optimism, Vignesh looked as if he had just been hit by a hurricane. The piece of paper in Sujit’s hand clearly read fifteen tractors per month and he was not sure if he had heard the man right. ‘Did you say one five or five zero?’ he enquired, speaking as slowly as he could and enunciating every syllable carefully. ‘Not one five, sir. I said five zero per month,’ the dealer said earnestly. ‘Five zero?’ Sujit persisted. ‘Yes, sir,’ said the dealer with a smile. ‘So, you are clearly telling me that you will sell one hundred and fifty tractors over the next three months?’ The question was clearly directed at the dealer, but it was Vignesh who felt the heat of his boss’s glare. Sujit had suspected all along that his salespeople did not have their ears to the ground. What greater evidence than this? ‘No problem, sir. In fact, if you want, I can do ten to fifteen more,’ said the dealer. ‘Shall I put down your target as a hundred and sixty for the next quarter?’ ‘Of course, sir,’ came the unhesitating reply. Sujit felt triumphant. ‘Thank you very much, and I appreciate all your nice arrangements.’ Vignesh had just enough time to run towards the car and open the door as his boss hurried in. The drive back began in silence. The road was narrow, and the traffic was mostly large, overloaded trucks. Their car had come close to colliding with these overladen monsters twice. The driver was alert and focused. Sujit was equally alert, more focused, and very angry. The silence was unbearable and Vignesh wished that Sujit would say something, even shout at him. This was just the calm before the storm. And when the deluge happened, it did not come as anticipated. It came in very measured sentences. ‘This is the last time I want to be travelling on these terrible roads after dark. In any case, you and your team seem to have no clue at all about what is happening on the ground. Here is the Amroha dealer, charged up and ready to sell a hundred and sixty tractors in the next three months. And what is the target you have set for him? Forty-five? Is this some kind of joke?’ Vignesh began haltingly, ‘No, sir … but sir…’ but Sujit cut him off. ‘You heard the dealer yourself. On the one hand our company makes these major investments to double our production capacity. And on the other, just look at the kind of targets you guys set for our dealers. This is completely irresponsible behaviour. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. And I don’t want to hear anything more from you,’ Sujit finished, effectively shutting him up. During the rest of the journey, no one spoke. Vignesh used the silence to mentally update his CV and tried to recall the names of the two headhunters who had contacted him last year. Should he look outside the industry? The tractor industry was a small one. Word would soon spread that he had been fired. But then how would people know? Maybe the car driver understood English? It was nearing midnight by the time they reached Sujit’s residence in Friends Colony. ‘I want to see you in my office tomorrow at 11 a.m. Good night.’ The next day, early morning, Sujit settled down in his favourite garden chair with his cup of tea and a newspaper. As he sat there, he observed the company car arrive outside his gate. To his surprise, Vignesh and the Amroha dealer stepped out of the car. They walked up the driveway and came to stand before him in his garden. ‘What happened? I hope all is well?’ ‘Yes sir, all is well,’ said Vignesh, looking distinctly less anxious than he had last night. The Amroha dealer, standing close behind, was holding his ears, as if to apologize for something. Vignesh said, ‘After dropping you here last night, I drove back all the way to Amroha, woke him up, and asked him what his real target was. Would you care to listen to him now, sir?’ Sujit looked at the dealer, perplexed and beginning to get annoyed. ‘What is happening here? I thought we had agreed that you would sell one hundred and sixty tractors over the next three months?’ The dealer sounded deeply apologetic. ‘I am very sorry, sir, but with great difficulty I will be able to sell between thirty-five and forty tractors next quarter.’ ‘Then why the hell did you commit to a target of one hundred and sixty?’ Sujit exploded. The dealer flinched, voice falling to a whimper, ‘I am very sorry, sir.’ ‘Stop pulling at your ears and tell me the truth.’ The dealer’s words poured out in a rush, ‘I thought, sir, that when such a big man like you comes all the way to my dealership and asks me for sales projection, then I have to give a big number.’ Sujit looked at Vignesh who had a triumphant look on his face. Sujit could not help but see the humour in the whole episode. And, in a way, he had contributed to this situation. The dealer sold forty-two tractors in that quarter. And Vignesh did not contact the two executive search firms. Sujit did have a moment’s suspicion whether Vignesh had staged the whole thing to send him a message. But that passed quickly. On a positive note, though, Sujit, who had a reputation for being carried away often by what people told him, learnt a big lesson that day. He realized that people tend to tell you what they think you want to hear. This phenomenon came to be known as the ‘Amroha Effect’ within the company. And never again did Sujit fall prey to the Amroha Effect!",

The dealer flinched, voice falling to a whimper, ‘I am very sorry, sir.’ ‘Stop pulling at your ears and tell me the truth.’ The dealer’s words poured out in a rush, ‘I thought, sir, that when such a big man like you comes all the way to my dealership and asks me for sales projection, then I have to give a big number.’ Sujit looked at Vignesh who had a triumphant look on his face. Sujit could not help but see the humour in the whole episode. And, in a way, he had contributed to this situation. The dealer sold forty-two tractors in that quarter. And Vignesh did not contact the two executive search firms. Sujit did have a moment’s suspicion whether Vignesh had staged the whole thing to send him a message. But that passed quickly. On a positive note, though, Sujit, who had a reputation for being carried away often by what people told him, learnt a big lesson that day. He realized that people tend to tell you what they think you want to hear. This phenomenon came to be known as the ‘Amroha Effect’ within the company. And never again did Sujit fall prey to the Amroha Effect!",

      "content": "19 Did You Bite Off More Than You Can Chew? ‘Hi, Naina can I drop in and see you now?’ It was Adil on the phone. It was 7.30 p.m. and I was preparing to go home. Most of the staff had left. ‘Where are you now?’ I asked. ‘At Hauz Khas. I can be there in thirty minutes,’ he pleaded. I knew he would take a minimum of forty-five minutes to get to our office in Greater Kailash II in South Delhi. Traffic at that time was still bad. He sounded anxious, so I said, ‘Okay, come over Adil. I’ll wait for you.’ I called home and informed my husband that I would be late. As I waited for Adil, my mind went back five years to the time when he had joined our advertising agency in the print production department. He came from a much larger agency where he was the second in command in that function. Keen to leverage his contacts with suppliers and major printing houses in Delhi, I offered to take him on as the head of the department. We were a midsized setup and I had expected Adil to negotiate a good deal for himself in this move. ‘I hope you are satisfied with our offer?’ I asked him. ‘Thank you for the salary hike, I am happy with that. But can we re-look at the designation?’ he said. ‘I think Head, Print Production is appropriate. That truly reflects your role here and your predecessor too had this designation.’ ‘Could you please designate me as account director.’ I was quite taken aback. I said, ‘Your role here has nothing to do with the servicing function. That would be misleading in my opinion.’ ‘You know, moving from a large agency has already affected my image in the eyes of my colleagues there. Being designated as account director will help me save face with them,’ he said. I had felt then that I was making a big mistake offering to make him even the head of the print production function. How could someone, who drew his self-worth from what others thought of him, ever provide leadership to any team? However, not wanting to demotivate him at the very start of his career with us, I let him call himself account director. During his four years with us, he was an average performer who worked hard and never shied away from getting his hands dirty. I still remember how excited he sounded when he walked into my room that day eleven months ago. ‘Naina, I have got a great job offer from this large, diversified group. They have nine companies in India and Dubai and have offered me the position of vice-president, corporate communications. The salary and perquisites package are also much better.’ To me something about this did not sound right. He had neither the relevant experience nor the expertise for this new role. And the salary and perks offered were way above his real market value. ‘So, what have you decided, Adil?’ I asked him. ‘I really want to look at this offer, Naina. What do you think?’ he asked. ‘I have heard things about that group and am not sure whether I would recommend this job to you, Adil. Don’t get me wrong. There are stories floating around. They have suddenly become very visible in the last three or four years.’ ‘But they have 8,000 employees and seem to be doing well. The best part is they are located right here in Delhi. My daughter remains in the same school and I only have to shift to a larger flat.’ I had seen the corporate sector from up close. While I did not want to dampen his enthusiasm, I felt that I had to caution him on what he could be up against. ‘Adil, are you sure you are up for this? A large part of your new role would be about managing the dynamics amongst the various CEOs in the group, something you have never done in the past.’ ‘Don’t you think they would have assessed my capabilities before offering me the job, Naina? And the best part is that I report directly to the chairman.’ ‘The fact that you report to the chairman could create envy amongst the other senior folk. Remember, the biggest mistake many people make is to take on a job much beyond their existing competencies. They then struggle to cope in the new role and are in constant dread of being found out,’ I said, attempting to caution him. He seemed to have made up his mind and to some extent I felt guilty; by offering him a designation that did not really reflect his role, I had contributed to his being blindsided about his true abilities. At the same time, I realized that anything I said would only be construed as a ploy to hold him back, so I wished him the very best and let him leave. Money and designations meant a lot to him. After all, was that not the very reason he had come to us? I met Adil thrice since the time he left us. Every time he passed by our office, he would call and drop in on the pretext of having coffee with me. On each occasion he made it a point to tell me how close he was to the chairman, and how he often accompanied him abroad on the company jet. Adil also said his daughter was now being dropped and picked up from school in his chauffeur-driven Honda City. The list went on. The security guard called and informed that Adil was on his way to my office. It was 8.20 p.m. His face was ashen and he seemed to have aged. As he sat down, I offered him a glass of water, which he immediately placed on the table. His hands were trembling. I waited till his breathing returned to normal. ‘What happened, Adil? You seem very scared! Please relax.’ Tears welled up in his eyes. ‘Naina, I just don’t know what to do. This evening my chairman sought my resignation. He said I was not pulling my weight and that the other business unit heads were not happy with my contributions.’ My first instinct was to tell him that I had warned him but that would have been insensitive. ‘Things don’t happen so suddenly, Adil. They need to give you proper feedback and sufficient opportunity to improve. They are giving you full notice, I hope.’ ‘There is a top management strategy off-site meet planned next week and I have been excluded from that. The chairman felt it best that I resign and be away during the notice period.’ ‘Please have some water. Shall I ask for a coffee or tea for you?’ ‘No, thank you, Naina. I am okay. I should have listened to you before I took that job.’ ‘We all make mistakes, Adil. I am glad that this is over. Now go home and relax. I am sure you will find another good job soon.’ ‘The reason I came to see you, Naina, is that I have not informed my wife yet. I am worried she may go into depression. I hope you can give me a job.’ Our head of print production had resigned, and I was indeed looking for a replacement. I wanted to help Adil, but had to tread carefully. ‘Your earlier position here just fell vacant. But I am not sure how long you will stay with us this time.’ ‘Trust me Naina, this time it will be different.’ Not wanting to raise his expectations I said, ‘I hope you realize that even if I offer you a job, it will have to be at the same level and salary as it was when you had left us.’ I could see him struggle for the right words. ‘Could my salary be raised to cover the instalment payments of a new flat that I have booked recently?’ he asked. ‘My family, especially my daughter, is used to getting dropped to her school in my car. Could you also extend me the facility of a car and driver?’ ‘Sorry, Adil, the package will have to be exactly as before. I cannot afford to give wrong signals to our existing employees.’ He looked beaten. ‘I understand. Can I make a request please?’ ‘Sure, go ahead.’ ‘Do appreciate where I am coming from. Would it be okay if I try and look around for a job that hopefully pays something close to my current salary and perquisites? Just give me a month for this. Otherwise, I shall take your offer and promise not to leave.’ I thought that was a fair request. ‘I am fine with that. I shall wait for a month.’ He suddenly appeared much more relaxed. He thanked me and we walked out together. I felt sad for Adil and many others like him. If only he had listened to me eleven months ago. I had cautioned him about taking a job that paid much above his market value, and one that demanded capabilities way beyond what he possessed. A month later, Adil re-joined us. His designation, salary and perquisites were exactly the same as they were when he left us. I was happy that I could help him. Adil’s real problem was not the way the chairman treated him. It was his unrealistic perceptions about his own capabilities. Like so many other corporate professionals, Adil had bitten off more than he could chew!",

      "content": "20 What’s Sweeter Than Revenge? It was 3.30 a.m. Sleep had abandoned him. Ashok got up from his side of the bed, careful not to wake up his wife Prabha, and moved to the balcony of their seventeenth-floor apartment. He sat on the swing there, looking down at the DLF Golf Course Road, which was deserted and quiet at that time. He knew it was just another few hours before this road erupted in noise and chaos, punctuated by instances of road rage. He looked up at the sky. Everything looked calm and peaceful. Only he was aware of the turmoil within himself. The Fenesta doors slid open behind him and Prabha quietly came over and sat beside him. She rested her head on his shoulder. Neither of them said anything for a long time. The events of that evening flashed through his mind. Eight hours ago, Ashok had walked into his flat, trying to appear normal. ‘You don’t look very good. Is everything okay?’ his wife enquired. It was her birthday and she was all dressed up. He had promised to take her to the club. The children were at a sleepover at a friend’s place. ‘Yes, all is well. Why do you ask?’ He tried to smile. But wives have this sixth sense. She stood in front of him, looked him in the eye and said, ‘Remember, Ashok? We promised to be honest with each other.’ He sighed. ‘Give me a glass of water,’ he said, and sat down on the settee in the drawing room. She joined him a minute later, carrying a glass of water, waiting for him to begin. ‘I got fired today,’ he whispered. The news hit Prabha hard and she felt her legs were about to collapse under her. She managed to get a hold on herself and sat down. She knew she had to be strong for Ashok’s sake. ‘How could they do that? You are the country head in India,’ she managed to say. ‘What really hurts is the way it was done.’ With a pained look in his eyes, he continued, ‘You remember Jeffrey, who was promoted as president of our company last month?’ ‘Yes, I remember him. Was he not transferred from the UK to the US?’ ‘Yes, that’s him. He is currently on a visit to India. This evening, he called me into his room and didn’t even have the courtesy to ask me to sit down. All he uttered were a few sentences. He started by saying: ‘Ashok, you know that I am now the president and CEO of the company.’ ‘Of course, Jeffrey,’ I replied. ‘You and I have had many disagreements in the past. I still remember those executive committee meetings where you often made me look bad,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Come now, Jeffrey. Don’t take it so personally. It’s just that we often differed on the strategic directions of our company. I don’t even remember those incidents now.’ ‘You may have forgotten, but I have not,’ he said. And before I could say anything, he continued, ‘my immediate priority is to build a team that I can trust.’ ‘I understand, Jeffrey. Please rest assured you have my full support.’ ‘The truth is that I don’t trust you, Ashok. I am sorry I can’t have you on my team,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Are you firing me?’ I asked him. ‘Well, things would be less messy if you just resigned. I am sure you would prefer it that way.’ ‘You don’t leave me much of a choice, do you, Jeffrey? This is all too sudden,’ I said. ‘Well I cannot help it. I need to build my team at the earliest,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Okay I shall resign and serve my notice. When do you want to make the announcement?’ I asked him. ‘I want you to resign and quit immediately. Your accounts will be settled right away and we shall ensure you get a good severance package.’ Ashok finished recounting the conversation. ‘And that was it, Prabha. Just those few sentences and he sacked me, just like that. I have never felt so humiliated in all my life,’ said Ashok. Jeffrey and Ashok had been colleagues till just a few months ago. In fact, in the internal pecking order of the executive leadership team, Ashok was rated higher than Jeffrey. Every one within that team was completely taken aback when Jeffrey was promoted to replace the previous president. Prabha was lost for words. She could see that Ashok was devastated. What could or should she say at a time like this? ‘Don’t worry, Ashok. We have been through so many difficult situations in the past and have we not overcome all of them?’ ‘I know. But remember, I am not getting any younger. It’s not going to be easy to find a job soon. And our kids would be ready for college in the next two years. Why does all this have to happen now?’ ‘God has taken care of us till now and He will not forsake us now. We must not lose faith,’ said Prabha. ‘If there is a God up there, I pray that one day Jeffrey goes through what he has done to me. I can never forgive him.’ They did not go out for dinner that night. Prabha changed her clothes and made some omelettes and toast. Neither had an appetite and neither spoke much over dinner. It was as if death had suddenly descended on their home and taken away someone precious. They later retired to bed. In the days following his sacking, Ashok went into a shell and refused to meet anyone. Though money was not an immediate problem, Prabha worried that Ashok’s self-esteem was so low that he would soon go into depression. The kids were very understanding and supportive. Close friends who were aware of the situation tried to do their best to counsel Ashok without appearing to be sympathetic or condescending. And then, what Prabha feared the most came to pass – Ashok had a heart attack. Fortunately, it happened during the day while they had some friends over for lunch. Ashok suddenly broke into a cold sweat and complained of a shooting pain in his left arm and feeling some discomfort around his neck and jaw. He was rushed to a hospital close by and immediately taken into the emergency section. Three arteries were blocked and the doctors took him into the operation theatre at once. Four hours later, he was moved into a private ward with restricted access to family members. Prabha stayed in his room throughout and the children visited twice a day. Ashok could see what all this had done to his family, and, deep within his repaired heart, he only wished for one thing – that Jeffrey too suffered the way he was suffering. Ashok took a few weeks to recover from his operation. Friends visited him at home. Many brought flowers and a few even gifted some books. And the best thing that happened during this period was that he caught up with his reading. His favourite book, the one on Nelson Mandela, a truly inspiring story, was kept on his bedside table. He soon put himself in the market and connected with executive search firms. A few offers came by and he accepted the role of COO with a technology company in Chennai. A very difficult phase in his life was behind him. Three years later, a large US-based private equity firm hired Ashok to oversee some of their investments in the technology space. One of these was the company he had worked for earlier and where Jeffrey was still the president. Soon it was time for Ashok to travel to the US and meet up with Jeffrey and his team. They met in Jeffrey’s office in Palo Alto. ‘Jeffrey, you know that your company is now a part of my portfolio,’ Ashok began. Jeffrey nodded, and recalling their interaction four years ago in India, he knew what was coming. Ashok continued, ‘The last time we met, you would recall, it was not a very nice experience, especially for me.’ ‘Ashok, you know that was not personal. I was just doing my job,’ Jeffrey said defensively. ‘Yes, of course Jeffrey. Just the way I was doing my job when I differed with you on strategy while we were together. None of it was personal.’ ‘I see where you are going. So this is all about revenge,’ said Jeffrey waiting for the inevitable. ‘Well, I would not put it that way. It’s just that I too have a job to do. And my first priority, of course, is to decide on a team here that I can trust.’ He is playing with me first before the final thrust, thought Jeffrey. Ashok paused for a moment and what he said next completely stunned Jeffrey, ‘I want to tell you that I have full trust in you, Jeffrey, and I look forward to your support. Come, let’s go and meet your team.’ As they moved towards the conference room, where the others waited, Jeffrey did not believe a word of what Ashok said. All this was a ploy to make him drop his guard before the final shot was delivered. Ashok greeted the others. Some of them were his ex-colleagues and some had worked with him. After the initial exchange of pleasantries, he addressed them, ‘You know this is one of the best companies in my portfolio. From whatever I have seen, Jeffrey and you all are doing a great job. I would like all of you to continue just the way you have been doing. I will visit every quarter and promise to spend more time with you during the next trip. On this visit, I wanted to just say hello to you all and catch up with Jeffrey.’ Some of them were aware of the manner in which Ashok had been forced to leave the company and believed that Jeffrey’s days were numbered. Jeffrey felt like a condemned man whose sentence had been pronounced and all that remained was the electric chair. How he wished Ashok had just fired him and ended the suspense! In any case, he had made up his mind to connect with an executive search firm soon. A few days later, Jeffrey received an email from Ashok reiterating his trust in him and his team. What caught his eye was the quote at the end of the mail: ‘As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.’ – Nelson Mandela. At that moment, Jeffrey realized how wrong he was and his respect for Ashok grew manifold. Sometimes, revenge isn’t as sweet, perhaps, as forgiveness.",

You are the country head in India,’ she managed to say. ‘What really hurts is the way it was done.’ With a pained look in his eyes, he continued, ‘You remember Jeffrey, who was promoted as president of our company last month?’ ‘Yes, I remember him. Was he not transferred from the UK to the US?’ ‘Yes, that’s him. He is currently on a visit to India. This evening, he called me into his room and didn’t even have the courtesy to ask me to sit down. All he uttered were a few sentences. He started by saying: ‘Ashok, you know that I am now the president and CEO of the company.’ ‘Of course, Jeffrey,’ I replied. ‘You and I have had many disagreements in the past. I still remember those executive committee meetings where you often made me look bad,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Come now, Jeffrey. Don’t take it so personally. It’s just that we often differed on the strategic directions of our company. I don’t even remember those incidents now.’ ‘You may have forgotten, but I have not,’ he said. And before I could say anything, he continued, ‘my immediate priority is to build a team that I can trust.’ ‘I understand, Jeffrey. Please rest assured you have my full support.’ ‘The truth is that I don’t trust you, Ashok. I am sorry I can’t have you on my team,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Are you firing me?’ I asked him. ‘Well, things would be less messy if you just resigned. I am sure you would prefer it that way.’ ‘You don’t leave me much of a choice, do you, Jeffrey? This is all too sudden,’ I said. ‘Well I cannot help it. I need to build my team at the earliest,’ said Jeffrey. ‘Okay I shall resign and serve my notice. When do you want to make the announcement?’ I asked him. ‘I want you to resign and quit immediately. Your accounts will be settled right away and we shall ensure you get a good severance package.’ Ashok finished recounting the conversation. ‘And that was it, Prabha. Just those few sentences and he sacked me, just like that. I have never felt so humiliated in all my life,’ said Ashok. Jeffrey and Ashok had been colleagues till just a few months ago. In fact, in the internal pecking order of the executive leadership team, Ashok was rated higher than Jeffrey. Every one within that team was completely taken aback when Jeffrey was promoted to replace the previous president. Prabha was lost for words. She could see that Ashok was devastated. What could or should she say at a time like this? ‘Don’t worry, Ashok. We have been through so many difficult situations in the past and have we not overcome all of them?’ ‘I know. But remember, I am not getting any younger. It’s not going to be easy to find a job soon. And our kids would be ready for college in the next two years. Why does all this have to happen now?’ ‘God has taken care of us till now and He will not forsake us now. We must not lose faith,’ said Prabha. ‘If there is a God up there, I pray that one day Jeffrey goes through what he has done to me. I can never forgive him.’ They did not go out for dinner that night. Prabha changed her clothes and made some omelettes and toast. Neither had an appetite and neither spoke much over dinner. It was as if death had suddenly descended on their home and taken away someone precious. They later retired to bed. In the days following his sacking, Ashok went into a shell and refused to meet anyone. Though money was not an immediate problem, Prabha worried that Ashok’s self-esteem was so low that he would soon go into depression. The kids were very understanding and supportive. Close friends who were aware of the situation tried to do their best to counsel Ashok without appearing to be sympathetic or condescending. And then, what Prabha feared the most came to pass – Ashok had a heart attack. Fortunately, it happened during the day while they had some friends over for lunch. Ashok suddenly broke into a cold sweat and complained of a shooting pain in his left arm and feeling some discomfort around his neck and jaw. He was rushed to a hospital close by and immediately taken into the emergency section. Three arteries were blocked and the doctors took him into the operation theatre at once. Four hours later, he was moved into a private ward with restricted access to family members. Prabha stayed in his room throughout and the children visited twice a day. Ashok could see what all this had done to his family, and, deep within his repaired heart, he only wished for one thing – that Jeffrey too suffered the way he was suffering. Ashok took a few weeks to recover from his operation. Friends visited him at home. Many brought flowers and a few even gifted some books. And the best thing that happened during this period was that he caught up with his reading. His favourite book, the one on Nelson Mandela, a truly inspiring story, was kept on his bedside table. He soon put himself in the market and connected with executive search firms. A few offers came by and he accepted the role of COO with a technology company in Chennai. A very difficult phase in his life was behind him. Three years later, a large US-based private equity firm hired Ashok to oversee some of their investments in the technology space. One of these was the company he had worked for earlier and where Jeffrey was still the president. Soon it was time for Ashok to travel to the US and meet up with Jeffrey and his team. They met in Jeffrey’s office in Palo Alto. ‘Jeffrey, you know that your company is now a part of my portfolio,’ Ashok began. Jeffrey nodded, and recalling their interaction four years ago in India, he knew what was coming. Ashok continued, ‘The last time we met, you would recall, it was not a very nice experience, especially for me.’ ‘Ashok, you know that was not personal. I was just doing my job,’ Jeffrey said defensively. ‘Yes, of course Jeffrey. Just the way I was doing my job when I differed with you on strategy while we were together. None of it was personal.’ ‘I see where you are going. So this is all about revenge,’ said Jeffrey waiting for the inevitable. ‘Well, I would not put it that way. It’s just that I too have a job to do. And my first priority, of course, is to decide on a team here that I can trust.’ He is playing with me first before the final thrust, thought Jeffrey. Ashok paused for a moment and what he said next completely stunned Jeffrey, ‘I want to tell you that I have full trust in you, Jeffrey, and I look forward to your support. Come, let’s go and meet your team.’ As they moved towards the conference room, where the others waited, Jeffrey did not believe a word of what Ashok said. All this was a ploy to make him drop his guard before the final shot was delivered. Ashok greeted the others. Some of them were his ex-colleagues and some had worked with him. After the initial exchange of pleasantries, he addressed them, ‘You know this is one of the best companies in my portfolio. From whatever I have seen, Jeffrey and you all are doing a great job. I would like all of you to continue just the way you have been doing. I will visit every quarter and promise to spend more time with you during the next trip. On this visit, I wanted to just say hello to you all and catch up with Jeffrey.’ Some of them were aware of the manner in which Ashok had been forced to leave the company and believed that Jeffrey’s days were numbered. Jeffrey felt like a condemned man whose sentence had been pronounced and all that remained was the electric chair. How he wished Ashok had just fired him and ended the suspense! In any case, he had made up his mind to connect with an executive search firm soon. A few days later, Jeffrey received an email from Ashok reiterating his trust in him and his team. What caught his eye was the quote at the end of the mail: ‘As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.’ – Nelson Mandela. At that moment, Jeffrey realized how wrong he was and his respect for Ashok grew manifold. Sometimes, revenge isn’t as sweet, perhaps, as forgiveness.",

      "content": "21 The Last Supper There was not a single occasion when Samarth did not challenge or counter anything I said. It was not just me, but every member in our leadership team had often been at the receiving end of his caustic tongue. He reserved his best for those meetings in which the MD was also present. Samarth’s behaviour was starting to get to me, but it’s not as if I had not been forewarned! A year ago, prior to my joining the company as the head of marketing, the head of the search firm had informed me, ‘Given your current track record, Rudra, I think you will easily make the transition to this automobile company.’ He continued, ‘This company is on a great trajectory and has an employee-centric culture. You will find that the top team works as a great unit and they are all very supportive of each other. The only person you need to watch out for is the head of sales, Samarth. Try not to rub him the wrong way. He believes that the sales function is the key business driver in the company and every other function is subordinate to sales. And, as for his views on marketing, the less said the better.’ I laughed and interrupted him, ‘I thought you would motivate me to take this job. Instead, you seem to be scaring me away from it.’ He smiled and said, ‘Of course not, Rudra. But it’s my duty to give you a realistic picture. As a principle, I never oversell a job to a client. And that’s why I have possibly the best track record in this industry. I believe that a job is no different than life itself. Start either of them with the wrong expectations and then there is no end to frustration. I want to, however, assure you that you will find a great ally in Pratik, the MD.’ I could see he was trying his best not to alarm me. After weighing the pros of staying on at India’s best-known FMCG company, and the cons of moving to the automobile sector, I decided to take the plunge. Their Japanese partners were global leaders and it could be my stepping-stone to an international career. Samarth was the consummate sales person, articulate and aggressive. Five feet seven in height, built like a prize-fighter with his shoulders always hunched, ready to deliver that knockout punch. I could visualize him maintaining that posture even while he slept! Winning was everything to him. Be it a discussion where he always had the last word, or a sales deal, which he had to win at any cost, even if it meant going against set industry practices. He couldn’t care less that competition often raised a hue and cry singling out our practices for being questionable. Over a cup of coffee, I once asked the HR head, ‘Don’t you think Samarth is more equal than the rest of us? Why does Pratik always give him such a long rope?’ ‘I get a feeling that since Samarth always meets his numbers, it helps Pratik face the analysts with confidence. I did point out to Pratik that Samarth’s abrasive attitude was undermining team spirit. Pratik defended him saying, “Oh, that is just how he is. He actually means no harm,’” replied the HR head. Once every quarter, Pratik and Samarth would travel to Tokyo to attend the periodical review meetings with our collaborators. And on their return, it was customary for Pratik to brief us on what transpired in those meetings and we all looked forward to this. What followed after this was unbearable. Samarth, would literally take it upon himself to educate us on the latest developments in Japan and around the globe. It would not be so excruciating had he limited himself to developments in the sales function. But that was never to be. He was an authority on every subject under the sun. During one such meeting, I interrupted his monologue, and countered him. Samarth was ready with his riposte, ‘Sorry, Rudra, I am not on the same page with you right now. I suggest you lend me the book from which you are quoting this. Let me read that too and then we can discuss.’ I had walked into that one. I looked around the room for support. Pratik and the others were smiling and seemed to enjoy my discomfiture. Soon Pratik signalled, ‘Excuse me, gents, if we are done with the day’s agenda, I want to share something. Sometime next month, our Japanese partner’s chairman is flying back to Tokyo from London. I invited him to stop by in Delhi. The good news is that he has agreed. I’m planning to host a gala dinner for him. Rudra, could you please manage the details?’ Immediately, Samarth jumped in, ‘Let’s hold this at The Oberoi. I’ve been to a few wonderful parties there.’ I ignored him. I made up my mind, at that instant, that the venue would be anywhere but The Oberoi. ‘I am looking at inviting around sixty couples, including key government officials and corporate heads,’ said Pratik and closed the meeting. The next day, I made a tentative reservation for a rooftop venue at The Taj Mahal Hotel, Mansingh Road, and one at The Oberoi too. At my next meeting with Pratik, I suggested the Taj Mansingh as the venue for the dinner. ‘Why don’t you look at The Oberoi as Samarth had suggested? My wife also feels it would be a great choice. Many of her friends often party there.’ Pratik’s wife was a prominent socialite, well known for the lavish parties that she threw. Celebrities from the film and cricketing world would be present often, and her PR team would ensure good coverage on Page Three of the leading newspapers. It was rumoured that she once had her husband pull his company’s advertisements from a major newspaper whose critic had panned one of her parties. I had to be careful in choosing the hotel now, as it was well known that no one dared to ignore his wife’s views. Not even Pratik! ‘I have made a tentative booking at The Oberoi too. But you know, we have held all of our dealer conferences at The Taj and I would like to leverage our position with them. And compared to The Oberoi, this hotel is more centrally located, especially for the government guests,’ I said, and before he could respond, I placed the menus from The Taj in front of him. ‘What’s this?’ ‘Since you are the host, I thought it best if you could help decide on the menu for that evening. The Taj has agreed to let us choose a mixed cuisine from amongst all their restaurants,’ I said, hoping to clinch the discussion on the venue. Pratik glanced at the menus and then turned towards me with an amused look: ‘Are you telling me that no one else, other than me, is capable of finalizing a good menu in this company?’ ‘No, I am not saying that, Pratik.’ ‘Then pray what exactly are you saying, Rudra?’ ‘All I am saying is that if you decide the menu, then no one will dare say it is not good,’ I said, emphasizing the words no one. He smiled, gathered all the menus and placed them inside his briefcase. ‘Let me pass these on to my wife. She is good at this, you know.’ I thought I had just won round one! The next day Pratik summoned me. ‘My wife has finalized this menu. And she is okay with the party being at Taj Mansingh.’ Round two to me! I made sure that Samarth and my other colleagues got to know of the venue only when the invitations reached them. On the evening of the big night, my wife and I reached The Taj early to check out the arrangements. As we entered the large, chandelier-filled rooftop hall, I could see that the large French windows enabled an amazing view of the city of Delhi. Pratik and his wife too arrived ahead of time, taking in and appreciating the details of the settings, especially the live jazz band playing soft music in the background. It was not too long before the guests started spilling out of the elevator. The Japanese chairman and his entourage were welcomed by Pratik and his wife and introduced to other dignitaries in the room. Gloved waiters served hors d’oeuvres and champagne, and guests formed their own circles. The chatter levels in the room soon rose, and people moved around trying to decide which group to join, depending on whom they knew or what was the subject of conversation. My colleagues and their wives had formed a group too. On seeing me, Samarth broke away from them and came over to where my wife and I were standing. ‘The Oberoi would have been a better venue,’ he said. I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. ‘The food over there is much better,’ he said. ‘Let’s wait till the food is served here,’ I said. He moved back to join his wife. ‘What’s his problem?’ asked my wife, her voice lowered. ‘Oh, think nothing of that. He just carries his attitude everywhere and tends to see every glass as half-empty,’ I said. My wife had heard about Samarth’s tendency to pass judgement on everybody and asked me to be careful. ‘Don’t worry I said. He is known to shoot off his mouth ever so often. He throws his weight around little realizing that the rest of us just tolerate him,’ I said. ‘I hear he is quite vindictive too,’ warned my wife. ‘Don’t worry darling, every organization has its fair share of such dick heads. Usually, one does not have to do anything to them. Don’t respond. Don’t react. They open their mouths so wide that they end up putting not only their shoes inside, but also a large part of their feet too. Then they trip and fall badly. These guys always wind up getting what they deserve. And don’t worry, I will be careful,’ I said. Two hours into the cocktails, soup was served. I saw Pratik’s wife move over to say hello to my colleagues and their wives. My wife and I joined that group and I signalled a waiter to serve our group. Samarth, as usual, tried to dominate the conversation. ‘I had suggested that we have this party at The Oberoi. The ambience and food over there is much better,’ he said. Pratik’s wife responded, ‘I have been having most of my parties there. I like that place.’ This was a cue for Samarth, ‘The vice president there is a good friend of mine. I had offered to get Rudra here some very good rates from them. But I guess he is not interested in saving some money for the company.’ Samarth’s wife looked at my wife, who in turn gave me a worried look. Thankfully, the waiter walked over with the soup before I could respond. Pratik’s wife picked up a bowl and turned sideways to talk to the lady to her right. Samarth, who was standing to her left, picked his bowl of soup, took a spoonful, looked towards me and in a slightly raised voice, said, ‘This soup tastes like dishwater!’ Upon hearing this, Pratik’s wife turned around, pursed her lips, glared at Samarth, and excused herself from the group. Samarth had once again managed to do the impossible! He had checkmated himself! Samarth was completely lost, not realizing the gravity of what had just happened. Some other members in the group were also trying to figure out the significance of the happenings. It was my turn now. I moved over, held Samarth softly by his arm and slowly manoeuvred him away from the group while he continued to look confused. ‘You should not have said that. Pratik’s wife heard what you said and she is obviously very upset,’ I whispered. ‘But why is she upset with what I said?’ he asked. The guy was really dumb. He could not be pretending. I decided to rub it in. This was my moment under the sun or, to be more precise, my moment under those bright chandeliers. ‘You really do not know,’ I said feigning sympathy and keeping my voice slightly above a whisper so that the others in the group could clearly hear me except Pratik’s wife, who had moved to the other corner of the hall and joined her husband and some of the Japanese guests. ‘Know what?’ he asked me still looking very perturbed. ‘That every item in the menu tonight was decided by Pratik’s wife.’ I had just landed the knockout blow. Samarth’s face turned ashen. He slowly walked away from the group and went and stood alone in one corner. His wife soon joined him. I think he realized that this could be his last supper in this company! He must have remembered how our administration manager was sacked a few months earlier for not responding in time to some work ordered by Pratik’s wife. I looked towards Samarth. For once, I felt very sorry for him. And sorrier for his wife who, for no fault of hers, had to suffer the worst because of what had just happened!",

He must have remembered how our administration manager was sacked a few months earlier for not responding in time to some work ordered by Pratik’s wife. I looked towards Samarth. For once, I felt very sorry for him. And sorrier for his wife who, for no fault of hers, had to suffer the worst because of what had just happened!",

It was a friend who made it easy. ‘Remember you need to only acknowledge those who, in some form or the other, helped in your journey in writing this book. Focus on that and the rest will be easy.’ First of all a big thank you to my daughter Pradipti – I never realized some one could push me as much as she did! And to my other children: Praneet and Megha, and Anand, for putting up with multiple retellings of the anecdotes that ultimately morphed into the stories in this book. G. Raghavan for his unwavering belief in me. Jashojit, (JoJo) Roy my colleague at Aricent. We dreamt of making this happen together. Praveen Arora at Tapasya Projects for his insights on people and his philosophy that one can learn from everybody. Vishwadeep Bajaj and Anubhav Batra at Value First Digital Media for being wonderful sounding boards for my story concepts and their encouragement. Special thanks to Jayati Baveja, Shweta Bahl and Punit Modhgil who kept me honest. To the Hindu Business Line where some of these stories appeared in a shorter format in their web-product Business Line on Campus (BLOC) as part of a regular column I wrote for them, titled ‘The C-Suite Fables’. I’m particularly grateful to BLOC’s editor Vinay Kamath, and senior deputy editor Parimala Rao, for providing me this opportunity. And the editorial team at BLOC. I am also thankful to the editor of Business Line, Ravi Srinivasan for agreeing to let me re-purpose these stories towards my book. Thanks to Sravanthi Challapalli, for helping me with editing the first drafts and her incisive questions. Ashwitha Jayakumar for editing some early stories. A big thanks to Krishan Chopra and Ananth Padmanabhan at HarperCollins, for their inputs and support. Sachin Sharma my commissioning editor at HarperCollins for being a critique, guide, and above all, a wonderful friend. Lastly, I would like to thank Vikram Lal of Eicher for showing me that values are just as important (if not more important) as margins.",

Taking you right inside the C-suite, Jayaram Easwaran presents twenty-one stories based on real incidents during his threedecade career. Each story has a message that addresses the most pertinent problems of our work lives. Stories about the dilemma of being virtuous when the stakes are high, the pitfalls of judging a book by its cover, the dangers of blind ambition, ego squabbles among the top brass and many others make this book a treasure trove of wisdom.",
